Uefa confirmed on Thursday that the charges would not be pursued, apparently because of a lack of evidence. That decision was reached despite Chelsea having released a statement immediately after the game in Budapest last December condemning those who had \u201cshamed the club\u201d and questioning \u201cthe brainpower\u201d of anyone who had engaged in the chants, which had been heard in the opening three minutes of the tie and referenced \u201cYids\u201d. Buck, who has been at the forefront of Chelsea tackling the issue of discrimination, had been asked about Uefa\u2019s decision as he collected a Community Project of the Year award for their \u201cSay No To Antisemitism\u201d programme. \u201cThe charge in the first place was a waste of time,\u201d he said. \u201cAlmost nothing happened. I really thought they were wasting their time, effort and manpower on something like this and missing some of the big pictures.\u201d Chelsea would have faced a partial closure of their stadium as a minimum sanction had charges been proved. \u201cIt is of course hugely important that allegations of discriminatory behaviour are investigated,\u201d said a Chelsea spokesman. \u201cIt is a subject this club takes extremely seriously, as evidenced by all of our public statements and our ongoing work and campaigns in this area. \u201cWe welcome Uefa\u2019s decision in this case, but our frustration, and the chairman\u2019s frustration which he expressed after the decisions, was that they rushed to charge before conducting a full investigation. Charging early only added to the media furore and speculation around the allegations and possible sanctions.\u201d \u201cI am very happy for our fans,\u201d added Maurizio Sarri, who is considering recalling Kepa Arrizabalaga against Fulham on Sunday. \u201cI am very happy for my players because, for us, it\u2019s really very important to have the fans with us. Especially in Europe. I hope and I\u2019m sure that the behaviour of our fans will be the best.\u201d Kick It Out said in a statement: \u201cKick It Out will always support football\u2019s governing bodies taking allegations of anti-Semitism seriously, investigating thoroughly and taking action where appropriate - regardless of the number of people alleged to have been involved.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
