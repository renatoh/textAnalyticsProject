Jones guided England to their first World Cup final since 2007 in Japan, four years after their failure to get out of the pool stage on home soil. There is a growing clamour in Australia for Jones to return as the Wallabies head coach but the 59-year-old is contracted until 2021 and Sweeney expects him to at the very least honour his current deal. England are due to fly home on Monday and Sweeney revealed he plans to meet Jones in the coming days to map out the coach\u2019s future. If he were to leave at the end of his current deal it would give England only two years to prepare for France 2023 and Sweeney revealed there is no plan for a successor to work under Jones before taking over in 2021, as was the intention under the previous chief executive, Steve Brown. With interest from other nations and with Jones\u2019s stock on the rise despite Saturday\u2019s comprehensive defeat by the Springboks, he could command an increase in his \u00a3750,000-a-year salary and Sweeney admitted resolving his head coach\u2019s future is among his top priorities. He said: \u201cIt makes sense doesn\u2019t it? If you\u2019re going to go through to France 2023 it\u2019s nice to have that unbroken stretch but both parties have got to be completely happy with it and we\u2019ll chat about that when we get back. One of the first priorities will be to sit down and have a chat. We will do it as a matter of urgency. You don\u2019t like these things to hang out there for a long period of time anyway, so it will be sooner rather than later.\u201d Of Jones\u2019s link to the vacant Australia job, Sweeney added: \u201cHe\u2019s one of the world\u2019s best coaches, if not the best coach, despite the result [in the final]. When you\u2019re in that position, you\u2019re going to have people sniffing around and you can imagine the story Australia would put together. I don\u2019t lose any sleep over other countries thinking about him.\u201d Jones will have a new-look coaching staff for next year\u2019s Six Nations with his scrum coach Neal Hatley returning to Bath and Steve Borthwick strongly linked with a move to Leicester Tigers. Scott Wisemantel\u2019s contract as attack coach has also now expired and while Sweeney admitted he has not spoken to Borthwick - who is a full-time RFU employee - about his future, he revealed Jones is close to making new appointments. \u201cEven before we came here and during the tournament here, [Eddie] is already drawing up his plans about what that coaching team will be,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s got some names in the frame and some of them have been spoken to already.\u201d As well as holding talks with Jones, Sweeney also intends to set up a review panel to look into England\u2019s performance at the World Cup. Jones\u2019s side surpassed expectations by beating New Zealand to reach the final but the RFU plans to meet all of the players to review the campaign. Sweeney was adamant he would not be holding a \u201cpostmortem\u201d over why England failed to produce a performance of note in the final. He added: \u201cI\u2019ve been very close to this particular campaign so I\u2019m not expecting anything in there that is going to shock us, but it would be remiss of us if we didn\u2019t look at everything.\u201d Jones\u2019s spending on the World Cup campaign is thought to have run over budget by around \u00a31m despite the RFU making cuts of more than \u00a310m and last year announcing more than 50 redundancies. The union is set to take a further hit this year because it loses out on ticketing revenue without any autumn internationals but Sweeney said funding for England\u2019s 2023 campaign would not be cut. The chief executive was unable to put a monetary figure on the difference between England winning and losing against South Africa but believes finances will be boosted by their run to the final and hopes to see an impact on participation numbers. He also confirmed Will Carling, who works with England as a leadership mentor, would continue to seek outside donations from the City. \u201cHe\u2019s got a very good black book,\u201d said Sweeney. \u201cHe\u2019s well connected and it\u2019s not an unusual thing to do. If you look at all the various ways we generate revenue, I can see him doing that and we\u2019ll encourage it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
