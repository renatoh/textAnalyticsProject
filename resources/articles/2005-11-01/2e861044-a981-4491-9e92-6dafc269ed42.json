According to Battersea MP Martin Linton, whose constituency includes the famous brewery (also the oldest in Britain), Young's, Strangers' Bar has dumped its cask-conditioned ale in favour of San Miguel - \"a lager emanating from the Philippines which is not only far inferior but far more alcoholic\". Appealing to the Commons leader, Geoff Hoon, during exchanges on coming business in the house, Mr Linton added: \"In the name of good taste, and indeed of parliamentary sobriety, would you not help us get Young's back? Mr Hoon retorted: \"I never cease to be amazed at the range of my responsibilities. \"I am delighted to discover that I might have responsibility for this matter, and certainly I am sure that it is something which will be investigated now that you have raised this question so eloquently.\" A spokesman for the Campaign for Real Ale put it more bluntly: \"This is a slap in the face for British brewers - to replace a great British ale with a nonedescript international lager. \"I would recommend to all MPs to avoid Strangers' Bar in future and instead visit St Stephen's Tavern or any of the other bars and pubs serving real ale.\" He also revealed that one of the advantages of the UK presidency of the EU this past six months was that diplomatic functions had been graced with a variety of British ales from small brewers around the country."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
