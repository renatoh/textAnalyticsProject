After days of turbulence surrounding his views on the way the British legal system might accommodate Islamic law, Dr Rowan Williams made his presidential address to General Synod, the Church of England's national assembly, in an atmosphere of some tension. Having torn up his original speech to address the remarks first given in a BBC interview and then in a lengthy speech at the Royal Courts of Justice, he took responsibility for \"unclarity\" that may have caused \"distress or misunderstanding\" among the public, especially his fellow Christians. But while he moved to neutralise the crisis which had engulfed him since his assertion that adopting certain aspects of Islamic law seemed \"unavoidable\", he stopped short of the full apology some critics had demanded. Dr Williams said he believed \"quite strongly\" that it was not inappropriate for a pastor of the Church of England to address issues around the perceived concerns of other religious communities. Clearly blaming some media coverage for the outpouring of anger, he told the Westminster audience: \"Some of what has been heard is a very long way indeed from what was actually said in the Royal Courts of Justice last Thursday.\" Synod members gave him a minute-long standing ovation as he took his seat and laughed at his jokes. He appeared relaxed and jovial during the address, which was well-received and inspired further applause on its conclusion, and expressed gratitude for the support he had received. He was not proposing, he said, to introduce sharia as a \"parallel jurisdiction\" and insisted there could be no \"blank cheques\" regarding the status of women and their liberties. He did, however, repeat his assertion that certain provisions of sharia were already recognised by society and that this could be extended to other areas. \"The question remains whether certain additional choices could and should be made available under the law ... for resolving disputes and regulating transactions. \"It would be analogous to what is already possible in terms of the legal recognition of financial transactions under Islamic regulation...it would create a helpful interaction between the courts and the practice of Muslim legal scholars.\" He acknowledged that his attempts to provide a \"coherent voice\" on behalf of all faith communities was a privilege \"however clumsily it may have been deployed in this instance\". He said he noted that many Muslim majority countries distinguished between the rights of citizens overall and the duties accepted by some citizens of obedience to Islamic law. \"It is this that encourages me to think that there may be ways of engaging with the world of Islamic law on something other than an all or nothing basis,\" he added. His attempts to clarify his position came amid press reports that a member of the 482-strong Synod was ready to table a motion urging members to distance themselves from the archbishop if an apology was not forthcoming. Some of those present for Williams' address felt there was a \"coercive\" atmosphere in the debating chamber. \"There was almost a crowd mentality. I stood up out of respect but when I realised it was a standing ovation I sat down after a while.\" Conservatives have savaged Williams for what they see his an increasingly liberal approach. Rod Thomas, chair of Reform, a traditionalist movement claiming to have 1700 members, 600 of whom are said to be clergy, said: \"He has safeguarded his position as Archbishop of Canterbury within this country. His reputation as a Christian leader overseas has been dented. There are provinces who have said enough is enough.\" Williams showed his mettle by tackling the talk of schism that has loomed over the Anglican Communion since the ordination of Gene Robinson, the bishop of New Hampshire, in 2003. Aware that dioceses and bishops are boycotting Lambeth, the 10-yearly gathering of the world's Anglican primates, he said he respected the consciences of people who could not attend because of the presence of Christians who had \"acted against the disciplinary and communal consensus\" of the communion. \"I regret such a decision ... [it] shows the deep differences over theology and ethics that have so strained our connections.\" Lambeth could not be the end of the story, he said, and warned against using conflict as an excuse to \"pursue self-seeking agendas\" and the danger it posed \"in divided or fragile local churches\". The prime minister, who had been one of the first to criticise Williams' remarks, paid tribute to the \"great integrity\" and \"dedication\" of the archbishop. Mr Brown's spokesman said the prime minister understood the \"difficulty\" currently facing Williams. The two men had a \"close\" relationship and stayed in close touch, he said. The spokesman added: \"The prime minister believes the Archbishop of Canterbury is a man of great integrity and dedication to public and community service and he understands the difficulty he is facing at the moment. \"The Archbishop has been clarifying and setting in a wider context the comments he has made and I'm sure he will continue to do so in the future.\" But he went on: \"The prime minister is very clear that British laws must be based on British values and that religious law, while respecting other cultures, should be subservient to British criminal and civil law.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
