It would have been all too easy to alight on the La Liga coverage. Following their side's loss at Sunderland nobody needed a glimpse of Xabi Alonso's excellence as he revelled in his new life during Real Madrid's win over Valladolid. The departure for the Bernab\u00e9u in August verged on the unavoidable. There had been differences between Alonso and Rafael Ben\u00edtez in 2008, when the manager seemed set on replacing him with Gareth Barry, but a \u00a330m fee and the midfielder's desire to be part of Real's extravagant project simplified the issue in the summer. Liverpool, however, keep on having to recalculate the potential cost of the transfer. It will seem a poor bargain if the club is not in the Champions League next season. Alonso, single-handed, could not have ensured Liverpool's qualification for the tournament, but the loss of such a footballer contributes to a mood of decline that would have been severe enough on the basis of results alone. That failure at the Stadium of Light was the fourth Premier League defeat of the campaign. Last season they were beaten just twice on that front and posed the sole semblance of a challenge to Manchester United. Ben\u00edtez must wish he could revert to his old curmudgeonly ways. The current nature of the line-up is a concession to those who craved excitement and self-expression. Glen Johnson is an attacking right-back and Alberto Aquilani, who should make his debut this month after getting over an ankle injury, is more adventurous than Alonso as he searches for opportunities to use his powerful shot. Liverpool may have to revert, at times, to the old painstaking approach tonight. They were beaten by Fiorentina in the last Champions League group match and will be in difficulties if they falter against Lyon. The Ligue 1 leaders were defeated at home by mid-table Sochaux at the weekend, but Ben\u00edtez will not take much note of that. Victories over Debreceni and Fiorentina are more relevant. It is hard enough to find a path through Group E, but the manager should be more troubled still by a general aimlessness. Ben\u00edtez is in his sixth season at Anfield and, after being in charge for so long, it is hard to sustain an air of vigorous leadership. While pragmatism, by definition, has its merits, the Spaniard did realise that the calls for a more expansive style could not be ignored. So far, he has not been able to bring such an approach fully to life without allowing conspicuous fragility. His means are limited. Ben\u00edtez has done well in the higher-price bracket and the purchase of Fernando Torres for around \u00a320m was shrewd, but the real test comes at the lower price levels. While acquiring Pepe Reina for \u00a36m was a coup, few others come into that category. There has been a tendency to fritter money away, with Ryan Babel and Andrea Dossena coming in at a combined cost of \u00a318.5m. To his credit, Dirk Kuyt has shown his worth as a hard-working player on the flanks, but he was supposed to be a regular goalscorer. As it is, the dependence on Torres and Steven Gerrard continues to be inescapable. On occasion, the shallowness of the resources is astonishing. In retrospect the outcome in Florence should not have been a surprise when F\u00e1bio Aur\u00e9lio and Lucas both had to appear in midfield. Ben\u00edtez does not have lavish sums at his disposal and the net outlay, bearing in mind the many sales, is unremarkable. He cannot be damned as a spendthrift. The real trouble is that few will tolerate his prosaic approach when it does not deliver satisfactory results. Even so, Ben\u00edtez is crucial in holding the club together. Without him there would have been even more focus on the already beleaguered Tom Hicks and George Gillett. The Americans agreed a price of almost \u00a3220m for Liverpool in 2007, but the schemes for a new stadium have not been realised. The co-owners have become estranged and divisions must be grave indeed for there not to be so much as a serious pretence of harmony. There is no reduction in the stresses and the reported search for someone to buy a minority stake did not appear to make any progress when Gillett was in Riyadh last week. Against such a backdrop, questions about Ben\u00edtez's capacity to revitalise Liverpool are of secondary relevance. Matters may not be going well for him, but there is enough unease at Anfield without dismissing him. In any case, Ben\u00edtez's future might simply be another topic on which Gillett and Hicks could not see eye to eye."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
