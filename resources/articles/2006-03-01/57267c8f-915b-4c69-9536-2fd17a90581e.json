Flanked by the Brazilian president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, in Downing Street, Tony Blair demanded a meeting of international heads of government to hammer out a trade deal, after talks in Hong Kong stalled last year. But he was also forced to express his regret at the death of Mr de Menezes at Stockwell tube station, and reiterate his full support for the Met police commissioner Sir Ian Blair. That killing, last July, has overshadowed the first state visit of president Lula to Britain. Mr Blair accepted the two men had talked about the tragedy in private. The Brazilian president will meet the family of Mr de Menezes today, but said the British people had been \"very understanding\" about the incident. However, both men stressed the need to further develop Brazil's status as world leader in biofuels in the race to combat climate change. Mr Blair also pledged UK support for Brazil's demand for a permanent seat on the UN security council. And turning to world trade talks, where Brazil is the leading nation within the G20 group of developing nations, Mr Blair said the two men were agreed on the need for a \"bold and ambitious\" trade settlement. \"The potential benefits of a dynamic and ambitious round are there not just for the developing countries and those countries that are most developed, but also for the poorest countries in the world,\" Mr Blair told a joint news conference. Their talks - at the end of Mr Da Silva's state visit to Britain - take place on the eve of a three-day meeting in London of trade ministers from the G6 group of the European Union, the United States, Brazil, India, Australia and Japan. It follows the failure of the World Trade Organisation ministerial meeting in Hong Kong in December to reach a comprehensive agreement which would have opened up international markets to producers from the world's poorest countries. Mr Blair said that the world was facing a \"huge moment of decision\". \"This is a moment in which it is essential that we show the leadership necessary to break through the obstacles and have that ambitious round,\" he said. \"The result of an ambitious round would be felt in greater prosperity, more jobs and greater social justice.\" The president, universally known as Lula, said: \"I am convinced that the United Kingdom and Brazil together will make a crucial contribution to unblock the Doha round at the WTO. \"To that end, we will work to convince other world leaders about the need for an agreement that would help developing countries and especially the poorest countries.\" A fresh meeting of leaders could give a \"decisive push\" to the negotiations. \"We need concrete, urgent measures to be taken to make our global order more balanced and more equitable.\" ActionAid trade analyst Tim Rice welcomed the \"interest\" from president Lula and Mr Blair but warned: \" [We] hope the leaders' meeting will not be a small and exclusive club. \"Mr Blair and President Lula say they agree on what would represent an ambitious outcome from the current trade round. This should not be code for a deal that sees poor countries make massive commitments while rich nations do little or nothing to help them.\" This weekend's forthcoming G6 meeting was condemned by other UK trade groups. The World Development Movement's head of policy, Peter Hardstaff, said: \"These secret invite-only talks are an attempt to stitch up a deal between the big players which can be presented to the rest of the world as a fait accompli. This is undemocratic and entirely excludes the world's poorest countries.\" War on Want, which is organising a demonstration outside the London talks, echoed that. John Hilary, director of campaigns and policy said: \"This meeting is an illegitimate attempt by a handful of powerful trading nations to stitch up a deal for the WTO. The EU and US have done nothing to cut their farm subsidies in these talks, yet they are pressing harder and harder to force open the services and industrial sectors of developing countries. \"Any such deal would be a disaster for the world's poorest nations. The only way out now is to abandon the talks altogether.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
