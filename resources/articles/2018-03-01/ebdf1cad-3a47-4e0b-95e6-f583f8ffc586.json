As things stand, the Englishman will miss out on a place at the first major of 2018 by three hundredths of a point \u2013 and a single place \u2013 on the world ranking table. Even more galling for the 42-year-old is that an outstanding effort over three and a half days at the WGC Match Play may count for nothing in the context of Augusta National. Poulter slipped to a comprehensive defeat to Kevin Kisner, by 8&amp;6, in this event\u2019s last eight. Poulter had seen off Louis Oosthuizen on Saturday morning while recording eight birdies, apparently edging him ever closer to a 13th Masters appearance. Maybe bad luck really is attached to that number. As if to compound Poulter\u2019s frustration, he had initially been informed by world ranking gurus and members of the media that he had done enough to reach Augusta after the last-16 win over Oosthuizen. The error was at least relayed to him before he returned to the course, with Poulter appearing unsure as to whether misinformation had a negative impact. \u201cI guess I should never listen to other people,\u201d Poulter said. \u201cYou finish a round of golf and the press and everybody else tell you \u2018You are in the Masters\u2019 then you get a text message 10 minutes before you tee off to correct everybody. \u201cIt\u2019s not an excuse or any form of a factor but it is a little disappointing. I asked three or four times if people were sure. The next time, I won\u2019t listen to other people, I will do my bit and focus on that.\u201d Poulter was typically forthright about his display in the Kisner tie. \u201cThe word for it is disappointing,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI put up no fight at all, it was rubbish. It\u2019s a shame, a real shame. It was bizarre, I just didn\u2019t have it this afternoon.\u201d Poulter does potentially have one last shot. Should he win next week\u2019s Houston Open, he would take the final place in the Masters field. Given his levels of motivation, and the current state of the Ryder Cup icon\u2019s game \u2013 the Kisner affair notwithstanding \u2013 it would be unwise to bet against such a scenario. The scale of his hurt after the Kisner loss means Poulter\u2019s involvement in Houston is not yet certain despite him currently being listed in the field. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided on that yet,\u201d he added. \u201cIt has been a long week and a draining week. I\u2019ll see, I will wait until Monday night. If I think I don\u2019t have the energy then I won\u2019t play.\u201d Such a situation would be a pity; Poulter did more than enough in Austin to suggest he can compete and not just turn out at Augusta. Bubba Watson booked his place in the semi-finals here with a 5&amp;3 success over Kiradech Aphibarnrat. Watson, the Masters champion of 2012 and 2014, has returned to prominence at precisely the right time after a spell during which he struggled with fitness and form. Even Watson did not bank on this Match Play run. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be on a flight at 9am on Sunday to go out of the country on vacation with my family,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to tell my wife that we ain\u2019t making it. It\u2019s no problem; this is exciting, this is what we want to do. We want to get to Sunday and have a chance.\u201d Watson will face Justin Thomas in the last four. Thomas could go to No 1 in the world on Sunday evening, a significant move with the Masters so close. The reigning US PGA champion defeated Kyle Stanley by 2&amp;1 in the quarter-final to make it five wins from five matches this week. Kisner will play Sweden\u2019s Alex Nor\u00e9n for a final spot. Nor\u00e9n sealed a last-four position with a 4&amp;2 win over Cameron Smith. There is solace for Smith in the fact he is guaranteed to appear at Augusta for only the second time courtesy of his exploits in Austin. What Poulter would give for likewise. The golfing gods really do move in cruel ways."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
