But given the $10,000 price tag for a coyote to guide them north, and the ever-present threat of kidnapping or sexual assault on the way, the 40-year-old mother of four didn\u2019t see how migrating would be possible \u2013 until last week. Watching the news one night, she saw a report that a caravan of migrants would soon be leaving the Salvadoran capital. Hoping that there would be strength in numbers, she decided this was her chance to head for the US with her two youngest sons, Randy, 17, and Danilo. \u201cThe situation is really ugly here, so we\u2019ve decided to leave,\u201d said Flores early on Wednesday morning in a plaza in downtown San Salvador where she was waiting with a few hundred would-be migrants as they prepared to start their long journey. A larger group of about 700 had set out for the Guatemalan border before she arrived. Her two sons are prime age for recruitment by the maras which dominate their neighbourhood: neither wants to join up, but neither feels able to defy the gang members. \u201cI\u2019m scared just to go to the store,\u201d said Randy. Anabel and her sons are some of the growing number of Central Americans who are banding together to head to the US and Mexico. Human rights organizations have occasionally organized caravans within Mexico before to raise awareness of their cause, but the mass movements from Central America appear to have begun when several thousand people left the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula on 12 October. Since then, at least one another caravan has left from Honduras and three have set out from El Salvador. \u201cGoing alone is risky,\u201d said Carlos Humberto Alfaro, 38, who was also waiting to leave. \u201cBut a caravan is safer.\u201d Donald Trump and his Republican allies have accused political groups in the US and Latin America of coordinating the caravans to undermine his government before the midterm elections on 6 November. But there is no evidence to support this. Instead, the groups appear to have been organized by ordinary citizens in El Salvador through Facebook groups and WhatsApp chat groups. The groups have overturned migrants\u2019 normal behaviour: instead of seeking to move without being seen \u2013 by authorities or criminals \u2013 they are are hoping that travelling in the open will keep them safe. The spate of caravans doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that more people are migrating \u2013 they are just more visible, said Edgar Vallecillos of the Scalabrini International Migration Network. \u201cIt\u2019s just another way of migrating: people have always gone individually or in families,\u201d he said. \u201cCentral America \u2013 particularly Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador \u2013 have been in a crisis, but that crisis has been invisible,\u201d said Patricia Montes, director of Centro Presente, an organization that works with Central American migrants in Boston. The crisis started in the 1980s, she said, when the countries experienced brutal civil wars and destabilizing US intervention. Since then, migration has been driven by violence, poverty and climate change. \u201cThe caravan is a new expression of this same migratory phenomenon,\u201d she said. Trump has deployed troops on the southern border, and threatened to cut aid payments. Mexican and Guatemalan have clashed with migrants trying to cross the border between the two countries, killing at least two. And some of the travellers are well aware of the hostility the caravans have provoked \u2013 but they feel they have no choice. \u201cSeeing so many negative stories can discourage a person,\u201d said Alfaro, adding that he had been following the caravan\u2019s progress on television news and social media. \u201cBut at the same time, the situation forces a person to leave.\u201d Alfaro makes $10 a day doing sporadic construction work, but it\u2019s not enough to feed his son, he said. Nearly 165,000 migrants from Central America\u2019s northern triangle were apprehended crossing into the US last year \u2013 47,900 from Honduras, 50,011 from El Salvador and 66,807 from Guatemala. Many are refugees fleeing for their lives. Violence has been decreasing in El Salvador since 2015, but the country still has one of the highest homicide rates in the world with nearly 4,000 murders in 2017. The country also has one of the highest rates of internal displacement, with 296,000 Salvadorans on the run within the country\u2019s borders. But moving towns doesn\u2019t keep them safe: in a country roughly the size of Massachusetts, Salvadorans are never more than a few hours\u2019 drive from whoever was threatening them. As reporters snapped photos of the migrants early on Wednesday morning, some concealed their faces, scared of being identified by whoever they were fleeing. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll make it or be turned back,\u201d said one 17-year-old girl sitting hunched on the fringes of the group with her half-brother of the same age. She seemed terrified: her eyes scanned the plaza as she spoke, and didn\u2019t want to say what exactly had prompted them to flee. But despite her fear, leaving home was not an easy choice: there is no guarantee they will reach their final destination unscathed. \u201cIt does make you scared, but you have to do it when you have no other options,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe with the caravan we have a chance of making it there alive.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
