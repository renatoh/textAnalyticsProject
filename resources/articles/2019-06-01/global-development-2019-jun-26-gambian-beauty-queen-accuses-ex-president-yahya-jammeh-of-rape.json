Jammeh, who reluctantly stepped down in 2017 after 22 years of rule, presented himself as a deeply religious figure and an advocate of girls\u2019 rights and declared his small west African nation an Islamic republic. But Toufah Jallow claims he raped her as a teenager at a religious event on the eve of Ramadan. Two other women also accused Jammeh of rape and sexual assault in interviews with Human Rights Watch and Trial International, and eight former Gambian officials said they had direct knowledge of the events. Jallow is the only one disclosing her real name. The former winner of the prestigious Miss July 22nd beauty and scholarship pageant said she wanted to \u201cstart the conversation about something that is destroying the fabric of society\u201d \u2013 girls carrying the burden of sexual abuse. \u201cI felt like if I can do that with the president of the country, it becomes somewhat easier for someone who\u2019s dealing with a CEO, with a boss, with a schoolteacher or with an uncle, because the highest level is being exposed,\u201d she told the Guardian. For years Jallow had watched the prestigious July 22nd pageant \u2013 named for the date Jammeh seized power \u2013 on television. When she was crowned winner in 2014, she thought a scholarship would soon follow. Instead, she said, Jimbee Jammeh, the president\u2019s cousin and a State House protocol officer, began calling her to ask about a drama project she had to submit after winning the pageant. Soon she found herself being taken to Jammeh\u2019s private residence. \u201cFula girl,\u201d he greeted her, using traditional teasing between their ethnic groups, Jallow recalled. He was wearing a shirt and trousers, not his usual bulky robes. He gave her a fatherly hug and switched on the Animal Planet channel. \u201cHe was watching this lion hunt his prey, talking about it,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said his uncles were hunters and that hunters actually just mimic what lions do, and they have to take their time.\u201d He talked until midnight, she said, going through her proposal and reminiscing about his childhood. Then she left. After several more meetings, Jammeh arranged for Jallow\u2019s mother\u2019s house to get a water supply, and he sent gifts of furniture and offered Jallow a job like Jimbee\u2019s. Then one night at dinner, she said, he allegedly told her: \u201cI want to marry you, you know. When can I send people to go see your parents?\u201d She said no, blocked Jimbee\u2019s number and decided to have nothing more to do with Jammeh. But the night before Ramadan, Jimbee got through on a private number and told her to come to a Qur\u2019anic recitation ceremony at State House along with previous pageant winners. She felt unable to decline. Jimbee allegedly engineered it so that they were in a room alone and then left. Jammeh walked in. \u201cThis time it wasn\u2019t the fatherly \u2018hey Fula girl\u2019. His eyes were so red and he was so angry,\u201d she claimed. \u201cHe said to me: \u2018Who do you think you are?\u2019 His ego was bruised, seriously.\u201d Shouting that he could get any woman he wanted, he allegedly dragged her into the next room. \u201cHe said to me: \u2018This could have gone way, way, much better if you had just gone along. But it seems like this is how you want it,\u2019\u201d she claimed. \u201cThe echo of the reading of the Qur\u2019an outside was loud; I could hear every word of it when I was in that room. He pushed me so I was kneeling on the floor. And he pulled his genitals out and rubbed it on my face, saying things like \u2018let\u2019s see if you\u2019re a virgin\u2019, and I was screaming,\u201d she alleged. \u201cHe said \u2018it\u2019s not going to kill you\u2019. Then he took [a syringe] from his pocket and injected me right here,\u201d she claimed, pulling up her sleeve to show a scar. After that, Jallow said, she could not hear her own screams. She claimed he pulled off her leggings and underwear and anally raped her. She alleges she passed out, and when she woke up at 2am he was sitting on the couch watching her. He told her: \u201cGet out.\u201d Jallow decided she had to escape. She put on a niqab and went to the market where she gave the men following her the slip, she said. She crossed the Gambia River in a fisherman\u2019s boat, begged a truck driver to smuggle her across the Senegalese border and slept in a Dakar bus station until she could get help, then sought asylum in Canada. What allegedly happened to Jallow was not a one-off but appears to be part of \u201ca state-sponsored system to get women into his bed,\u201d said Reed Brody, a lawyer at Human Rights Watch who along with Marion Volkmann-Brandau has been building a case against Jammeh that covers the alleged massacre of migrants and his bogus HIV \u201ccure\u201d programme. Jammeh allegedly lavished gifts on the impoverished family of \u201cAnta\u201d, a pseudonym for one of the other women who has accused him of sexual assault. She claims she refused his advances until he threatened to take everything away from the family. She further alleges that a soldier was sent with Jimbee to force her to move to State House to be on call for sex whenever he wanted it. The third woman, referred to as Bintu, claims she was groomed and then told to undress in front of Jammeh and Jimbee, and when he started to touch her she started crying. She was told to leave and her scholarship was cancelled. Jammeh is hiding out in Equatorial Guinea along with Jimbee, protected by the country\u2019s president, Teodoro Obiang. Now a keen boxer who works in sales but still has the acting dream, Jallow is preparing to travel to the Gambia to tell her story there. On her way to a boxing class in Dakar, Senegal, on Tuesday night, shocked messages of support trickled in from friends hearing about her case. \u201cIt\u2019s hard. But what happened is harder,\u201d she said. Her goals are clear: she wants her story to make a difference and, if the case comes to trial, she wants sexual assault to be treated as seriously as murder, kidnapping and torture, of which Jammeh is also accused. \u201cI want it to be part of whatever brings him down.\u201d Efforts to obtain contact details for Jammeh in order to put the allegations to him were unsuccessful."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
