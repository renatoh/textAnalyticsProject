That's Gaz Coombes's older brother Rob, now an official band member after many years' de facto service. It's even harder to fault a band who have a stockpile of era-defining hits like Oxford's Supergrass have; up-tuned anthems which only the most palsied of curmudgeons could dislike. And the rest, too - four albums now, of slyly excellent songs. The 'Grass are so versatile. Thanks to their unquenchable pop nous, their barbering, and an impression - dating back to Britpop - that they might be 'fun', Supergrass still have one toe in the world of Smash Hits questionnaires ('You're famous for looking like monkeys. Has Will Young stolen your thunder?'). They also have more than one brown hush puppied foot planted in the muso arena, due to their skilful glances back to Marc Bolan, David Bowie and The Beatles, that domestic trinity of muses. They rate shaggy old Canadian Neil Young, too: a surprise cover of his 'The Loner' infuses tonight's encore with wiry transatlantic electricity. There's not too much homework here to tax the casual listener - Supergrass are a highly gettable band. Their gift is immediacy, well supported by substance. Tunes and musicality. And cheer. They write with awesome ease about the sun hitting the sky, about being all right, and latterly - on 'Grace' - their producer's children's trampolining escapades. But this ebullience doesn't always extend to their live show. Rock City is suitably rammed for the first night of their tour, a voyage destined to take Supergrass's fourth album, Life On Other Planets, on to the compact hi-fi systems of most of Britain. And everyone leaves happy, rosy-cheeked from bouncing to 'Pumpin' On Your Stereo', 'Sun Hits The Sky' and 'Grace', as irrepressible a fit of guitar pop as the charts have seen in a long time. But there's an odd lack of spontaneity in the way Supergrass behave tonight. For a band so bounding in song, they are strangely restrained in person. Supergrass don't turn on their charisma for an audience - they seem to save it for each other. Although Gaz is scrupulously polite, thanking everyone at the end of each song, it seems he's not interested in communicating anything more. First night stiffness might play a part. Twice they fumble the start of 'Strange Ones', a souvenir from their first album, I Should Coco. The set list, too, is awkwardly designed, top heavy with novelty. The first six songs they play correspond exactly to the first side of their new album (and Supergrass albums do still have sides, very much so). It's only been out two weeks, so the response to the excellent 'Za' and 'Rush Hour Soul' is more good-willed bemusement than the pogoing zeal of converts. These are, however, some of the best songs Supergrass have ever written. 'Brecon Beacons' is the real highlight of this section, a haunted romp that's destined to become a live favourite. Nottingham just doesn't know it yet. Runner-up is 'Evening Of The Day', a countrified ramble, sung mostly by bassist Mickey Quinn, that sees Gaz and Mickey swap ends of the stage. It's the most eventful bit of stagecraft we'll see all night. Well, apart from the shadow animals that drummer Danny Goffey makes with his hands while Gaz starts 'Moving' solo. Really, not much goes on. Supergrass are here to play the songs: not much more, no less. There's a bit of a cinematic backdrop, and the music comes in four acts (the new songs; a good midsection of hits like 'Mansize Rooster'; the rest of the new album, leavened by 'Richard III' and 'Sun Hits The Sky'; and the encore), but it's not exactly a riveting performance. Unless you close your eyes, that is, and focus on the strange keyboard noises hamming it up rather than the players. They're all over 'Life On Other Planets', probably due to Rob Coombes's expanding presence in Supergrass's songwriting. Tonight it seems as though the spacey organ thrum of 'Prophet 15' - named after a keyboard - has escaped. Like some weird sci-fi virus, it has infected all Supergrass's other songs. 'Sun Hits The Sky' is now even more Hammond-crazed, old favourite 'Richard III' features an incredible synthesised backing 'ooh', and 'Run' wanders, laser-guided, into Spiritualized territory. On a night low on drama centre-stage, it seems strangely fitting that the man at the back, who gave up space for rock'n'roll, should be the unwitting star of the show."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
