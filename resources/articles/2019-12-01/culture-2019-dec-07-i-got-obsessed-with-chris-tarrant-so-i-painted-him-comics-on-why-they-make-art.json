But are comedy and art really so irreconcilable? The supposed incompatibility of the two comes from the former being regarded as low culture and the latter as high. To bring humour into a civilised arena is seen as a juvenile affront to solemnity, like a fart in a sermon. However, that is comedy\u2019s true power: to take something or someone down to size. The godfathers of satirical cartoons \u2013 James Gillray and William Hogarth \u2013 knew that. Marcel Duchamp\u2019s best gags were a moustachioed Mona Lisa and a urinal in an art gallery, which combined mockery with incongruity. Sarah Lucas used humour to desexualise the male gaze, replacing a woman\u2019s genitalia with a plucked chicken and her breasts with fried eggs. And David Shrigley, with his barbed whimsy, is often laugh-out-loud funny. It works the other way, too. Take a look at some of our best-loved TV comedy: Reeves and Mortimer is pure dadaism, The Mighty Boosh had a Rousseau-ish richness to it, while Terry Gilliam\u2019s art stomped all over Monty Python. In standup, the relationship between the jokes and art is more subtle. An hour in Maria Bamford\u2019s company is a positively cubist experience in its disjointedness, and Simon Munnery errs towards the abstract (see his routine about his act belonging somewhere between unfunny comedy and bad art). Now, today\u2019s crop of standups are showing off their artistic chops, with an exhibition raising money for Mental Health UK. It\u2019s been curated by comic and artist Annie McGrath, and is quite the showcase: behold Harry Hill\u2019s take on Leonardo, and Josie Long\u2019s comic strips and collages. Joe Lycett plays it for laughs with his painting of a baby with the slogan \u201cWear a condom\u201d, while Eleanor Thom speaks about how art helps her cope with the \u201cconsistent pain\u201d of endometriosis. But what do comedians themselves think about the relationship between humour and art? Here, five of the community\u2019s more artistically minded members reveal all \u2026 Harry Hill Virgin of the Rocks The painting I\u2019ve donated is a modern take on Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s The Virgin of the Rocks, with Chris Tarrant, Phillip Schofield, Jeremy Clarkson and Piers Morgan. The ceramic figure [depicted in the centre] I got in the south of France. I got a bit obsessed with Tarrant at one point, when he had a messy divorce and was in the papers a lot. I just started painting him and got good at it. Art\u2019s a big thing in my life. I started in the 90s when Hello! was a big thing; I would paint pictures of the people in the magazine and [the publication\u2019s] recipes. I have a small building in my garden and most evenings I go out there. I bought this old school bench off eBay with a couple of vices on it and little cupboards underneath; it\u2019s quite nostalgic. I mainly paint but increasingly I\u2019ve been doing wood carving which is quite crude but I like it. To me, the paintings are quite serious. Obviously they\u2019re superficially silly, but they meant something to me at the time I was painting them that goes beyond the silliness. Also, whatever you put out comedy-wise, there\u2019s this filter of: \u201cDoes anyone else find it funny?\u201d but with painting, I don\u2019t give a shit what anyone thinks about it. There was one year in Edinburgh [at the festival], I was sharing a flat with Sean Lock. We would go out [after their shows] and get drunk, usually quite anxious and angry. But then I thought: \u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d so I went and bought a painting-by-numbers of two dinosaurs fighting, and did that instead. It\u2019s a difficult thing, that adrenaline after a show, but I find painting very therapeutic, just the process of sitting there and concentrating on something else. Tim Key Poem No 2538 My artwork is a poem, written by me, turned into a beautiful artefact by my collaborator, Emily Juniper. Emily\u2019s a genius and has an amazing eye. I sometimes photograph my poems and get obsessive about this and spend a lot of time squatting over them but it\u2019s a bit demeaning to me and, actually, to photography. Handing them over to Emily is more dignified. I\u2019m no art buff but I do have some art in my flat. There\u2019s one great bit of art of a man in a waterlogged suit. I also have some nice Russian film posters, and some beautiful Chinese cigarette-advertising poster things. When I was in China a few years ago, I smoked some fags that tasted horrible but came in really beautiful packets. Those are now framed. Frame anything and it can look beautiful, in my experience. I don\u2019t know if I would call my comedy shows artistic, but sometimes, when you have a clever person lighting it, there can be some nice moments. I think there definitely can be an intersection between comedy and art. The Office is funny but it also pulls away at something inside me more than a lot of Da Vinci\u2019s stuff has done over the years. I love comedy when someone creates a world of their own with just words \u2013 like John Kearns; that is mindblowing. Lolly Adefope Self-portrait My painting is a self-portrait in the style of Picasso. I had to make it abstract as I\u2019d never be able to do a real self-portrait. It was a really nice Sunday the day I painted it: it was raining outside, I set up in the living room, I put on Celebrity X Factor, and just painted for a few hours. I thought: \u201cIf this was my career I\u2019d be so happy.\u201d I like art that\u2019s simple but feels kind of genius \u2013 like David Shrigley or David Hockney. I like things with bright colours [that] aren\u2019t too stressful to look at, blues and yellows. That\u2019s my very intellectual art review! I don\u2019t really love looking at people on my walls; it\u2019s like people are in your house. I think [US comedy-drama] Atlanta is a work of art. Certain directors have that eye where something is beautiful as well as funny. And it feels like it\u2019s not just surface-level. Comedy can be quite stark. If you\u2019re just making people laugh, that can be one-dimensional. You have to bring something artistic into it, so it\u2019s working on another plane or is more complex. Making comedy is a privilege, so you should be doing something no one else can do. That\u2019s when it feels like art; it\u2019s a personal expression and it\u2019s being done in a unique way. Josie Long Natalie Helped Him I\u2019ve been trying to copy surrealist collages since I was a teenager, mainly to try and make my friends laugh. The best one I ever did is still mixing up a textbook on cathedral architecture and an annotated picture of the body\u2019s organs. For me, the pleasure in doing art is the process. Sometimes cutting up and rearranging text is the funniest thing in the world because it feels so naughty. The musician Jeffrey Lewis is my inspiration when it comes to comics. He works them into his live shows and writes about all kinds of subjects and styles. When I started out telling stories on stage, I used to have big A2 comic books to illustrate. I only stopped because they were so heavy and I wanted to see if I could do standup with no props. Some comics are definitely \u201cartistic\u201d in what they do: Zo\u00eb Coombs Marr, Bryony Kimmings, Harry Hill. James Acaster has a very pure and artistic approach to his work but, God dammit, we are all artists as well as silly clowns! As for my favourite artists, I love Marc Chagall\u2019s beautiful spirit and loving energy, and Dorothy Iannone is beautiful, loving and vibrant beyond belief. At home, we have a lot of really silly art: a picture of Simon and Garfunkel where one is saying: \u201cIs this art?\u201d; another one says, \u201cSpeaking!\u201d \u2013 the comedian Caroline Mabey made it for a party about 15 years ago where everyone had to bring a painting. But my sister is the real artist in my family, and she drew a portrait of my daughter which has pride of place. Vic Reeves Batman at Ease I did Batman on the toilet for Big Night Out; we animated it for the show. I\u2019ve done loads of superheroes having a dump, simply because that\u2019s not what you expect them to be doing. I reckon he\u2019s thinking about his life: \u201cIs it really worth it, what I\u2019m doing? I\u2019m Bruce Wayne, I\u2019ve got a big mansion, do I wanna be doing this?\u201d I paint celebrities, too, but I don\u2019t think of myself as a famous person, I\u2019m detached from it all. I\u2019ve only ever thought of myself as an onlooker. I really like the human body so I paint a lot of nudity; that comes from going to life classes. Basically, I like muscle formation but I also like Jimmy Tarbuck and taking the piss out of The X Factor. There\u2019s not really a gap between my comedy and my art; it\u2019s all the same thing. The comedy I do on TV came from me being at art school and seeing Gilbert and George films, thinking they were hilarious. I was trying to do that, a sketch version of art, and it ended up on TV. Comedy and art go hand in hand, even if it\u2019s not laugh-out-loud. David Hockney, Peter Blake, [Jean-Michel] Basquiat, John Currin. I want that in my art, too; the way I allow myself into other people is with humour, so it comes out in my art. I\u2019ve got notebooks of ideas but I tend to really keep things in my head. And when you have an idea, you have to act on it or it\u2019ll drift away. I paint or sketch for two, three hours every day. It keeps me sane. Bob [Mortimer]\u2019s painting is absolutely diabolical. Honestly, it\u2019s like a six-year-old child. He did a drawing of a frog once for me on a train, and I laughed all the way from Birmingham to the capital.
