It was a huge result for Arsenal at the weekend. The Gunners had infamously failed to win a Premier League match at any of their established big six rivals since the days of Herbert Chapman, it felt like, pretty much. So securing all three points at the home of Manchester United was a long overdue and most acceptable state of affairs. The epochal win catapulted Arsenal up to the 12-point mark, just four off the lead, and means they can continue to harbour semi-realistic hopes of a tilt at the title, just like close neighbours and pals Tottenham, who also won on Sunday and moved into second spot. The Fiver wonders which of them will have their hopes dashed first, and whether it\u2019ll happen before or just after Christmas. There\u2019s to be no such rollercoaster ride of giddy anticipation and plunging disappointment for United, though. That\u2019s because their Premier League horse looks to have already bolted, well true and proper, after yet another miserable capitulation at the Theatre of Recurring Nightmares. Was the slender 1-0 defeat to Arsenal worse than the shambolic 6-1 shellacking by Tottenham Hotspur? You\u2019d think it shouldn\u2019t be up for debate, but at least United strung together a couple of semi-coherent attacking moves against Spurs, to the extent of managing to do a goal. A sense of vaulting ambition remained amid the mayhem. On Sunday, by contrast, they took off Bruno Fernandes and Mason Greenwood midway through a half-assed search for an equaliser. Oh well. Oh Ole! United now haven\u2019t won at home since beating relegation-bound Bournemouth, who had given up the ghost, five months and six matches ago, and even that one looked in the balance for a while. It\u2019s their worst run at Old Trafford since the fag end of Frank O\u2019Farrell\u2019s reign, 48 years ago, though not quite so bad as the start to Herbert Bamlett\u2019s signature campaign of 1930-31, when they lost their first five at home, and their first 12 straight. Oh Bertie! Oh O\u2019Farrell! Bamlett somehow survived the season, even though United were destined for the drop; O\u2019Farrell by contrast was given the boot midway through, allowing United to scramble to safety. Nobody\u2019s seriously suggesting United will find themselves in another relegation scrap this time \u2013 mind you, nobody thought that in 1972 either \u2013 but history might just give the board pause for thought. Everton next Saturday suddenly looks very big indeed, with Solskjaer now just 4-1 to be the next Premier League manager to leave his post. Thank goodness for his chances of survival that the big match is at Goodison, because the walls of Old Trafford feel like they\u2019re closing in.

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cSir Bobby, you are my hero and I am devastated that you are having to go through this. I filmed alongside this man as a child and was in awe. I still am when I see you. This man, from day one, was everything I wanted to be. Kind, professional, caring, talented. Stay strong, we love you\u201d \u2013 Marcus Rashford is just one name among many in football sending their love and support to Sir Bobby Charlton, who has been diagnosed with dementia. RECOMMENDED LISTENING Football Weekly is right here, right now (or it will be soon enough, honest). FIVER LETTERS \u201cThe great Howard Wilkinson (of which it is obligatory to follow up with \u2018the last English manager to win the league\u2019) always used to say that you shouldn\u2019t bother to look at the league table until you\u2019re 10 games in. As a Sheffield Wednesday fan, I\u2019m currently taking his advice and after our loss against Wycombe Wanderers on Saturday I have just over 24 hours until our 10th game and have to look at this (scroll down)\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis. \u201cPlenty of stories on Twitter following the sad news about Nobby Stiles \u2026 but this one from Chris Egan sort of sums him up pretty well I think: \u2018I was training at WBA as a 15-year-old when Nobby was a coach. I accidentally studded him during a five-a-side and apologised. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever [eff]ing apologise on a football pitch again, son,\u201d he growled as he limped away. I was scared and in awe at the same time.\u2019 We won\u2019t see his like again. RIP hero\u201d \u2013 Allastair McGillivray. \u201cRe: Phillip Duffy\u2019s comment (Friday\u2019s Bits and Bobs) that two consortia going mano-a-mano (literal translation: hand-to-hand, as in combat) makes no sense. I can only image how perplexed he must be when trying to compare his team\u2019s head-to-head record against different opponents\u201d \u2013 Tom Murray-Rust (and 1,056 others).

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s hamstring-twang has healed up nicely and he may be back to face Liverpool on Sunday. \u201cWe are happy he\u2019s back but we\u2019ve been happy with Ferran [Torres] so we have an alternative,\u201d tooted Pep Guardiola. J\u00fcrgen Klopp wants us to stop talking about that Mo Salah penalty against West Ham. \u201cWhat can I say? It was a foul,\u201d he blabbed. \u201cI spoke to Mo and asked him how he feels and he said he has three knocks and one was from the penalty situation.\u201d Two Pope\u2019s O\u2019Rangers players, Jordan Jones and George Edmundson, have been suspended and placed into 14-day self-isolation after \u201cattending a private gathering with others outside of their household\u201d and breaching the Covid-19 bubble. David Alaba will be available on a freeman\u2019s come next summer after Bayern Munich pulled out of contract talks. \u201cThis means there is no longer an offer,\u201d roared club suit Herbert Hainer. Big Mick McCarthy is the new boss of Apoel Nicosia. Terry Connor will once again be his faithful sidekick. And Jos\u00e9 Mourinho celebrated Gareth Bale\u2019s winner against Brighton in the best way he knows: by digging out enemies. \u201cWhen I have five minutes I am going to Safari to look at Madrid\u2019s websites to see what they say,\u201d he sneered. STILL WANT MORE? The David Alaba rift has created ripple in relentless Bayern\u2019s sea of tranquility, writes Andy Brassell. Roberto De Zerbi studied Marcelo Bielsa at Lille so it\u2019s little wonder his tactics were ace in Sassuolo\u2019s victory at Napoli, reckons Nicky Bandini. Here\u2019s Sid Lowe on the latest drama at Valencia. To continue with the Big Cup and Big Vase at a time like this feels like an exercise in futility and jaw-dropping complacency, rails Barry Glendenning. The Premier League: 10 talking points thereof. Floating football brain in a jar Jonathan Wilson stops short of saying that Ole\u2019s army are in a relegation battle but says Manchester United\u2019s manager is far too one-dimensional. From three Ballon d\u2019Or titles to retiring at 28 when his ankle left him barely able to walk, Marco van Basten takes Donald McRae through his fall from grace.
