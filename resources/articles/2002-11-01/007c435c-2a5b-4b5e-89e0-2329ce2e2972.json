Take cushions to rest your heads on; the walls of the canal are very steep and this is the best way to view them. Travel time through the canal is one hour. J Houston \u00b7 The canal is used by ferries travelling between Italy and Turkey, mostly on summer services between Brindisi and Cesme. The ferry journey takes around 30 hours, so passengers spend one or two nights aboard. Passage through the canal is not guaranteed and may be made after dark, depending on the ship's schedule. Operators include Access Ferries (accessferries.de), Marmara Lines (marmaralines.com), Med Link Lines (mll.gr), Sancak Line (sancak line.com) and Turkish Maritime Lines (tdi.com). Turkish Maritime Lines has a UK agent, Alternative Travel (020-7249 9800, alternativeturkey.com). Geoff Hamer \u00b7 Take a day trip from the island of Poros. Tickets are bookable or available on the day of departure from Askeli Travel in Poros harbour, and refreshments are available on board. There is usually time allowed for a stroll round Old Corinth before the return trip. Elizabeth Bewick Anne Salmon would like to see the Altamira cave paintings in northern Spain. \u00b7 Because of the rapid deterioration of the prehistoric cave paintings due to bacterial growth (believed to have been introduced by visitors and then encouraged by the lighting of the cave), visits have for a number of years been restricted to a maximum of 20 a day. Applications for these visits must be made in writing (only) to Museo y Centro de Investigacion de Alatamira, 39330 Santillana del Mar, Cantabria, Spain (0034 942 84 01 57). The most recent news was that there was a waiting list of over three years (and even longer for popular dates, such as holiday weekends). However, following the recent opening of the new museum and full-scale replica of the cave and its paintings a couple of miles away, the ministry of culture has closed the cave completely from September 30 to facilitiate a full-scale scientific investigation of the deterioration and possible ways of reversing it. What has been happening at Altamira, even with very restricted visiting, seems to have been very similar to the disastrous deterioration of the paintings in the Lascaux cave in France 30 years ago, and the long-term result of the new investigation is very likely to be the same: a permanent closure to all visitors. Professor Patrick Boylan This week's questions \u00b7 I am a dwarf person and will be travelling to Thailand in January with a friend. I can walk, but all the travel tips for disabled people are for wheelchair users. Can anyone offer advice? Nora \u00b7 Where are the best places in Berlin to see in the new year? Sue Davis \u00b7 Is there anywhere in the world worth going to for a summer holiday that does not have mosquitoes etc?
