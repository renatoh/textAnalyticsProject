There's nothing like a computer crash - and losing important documents - to ruin your day. According to a recent survey by Avery, this is a common complaint in many offices and one of the biggest causes of workplace stress. There are many complicated reasons why your computer might be crashing, so if you have an IT helpdesk, it should be your first port of call. Make a note of exactly what you were doing when the crash occurred and pass this on to IT. If a technological saviour is not available onsite, try upgrading your computer's operating system. If you are running an old version, such as Windows 95, this could be the cause of the crashes. Try upgrading to the latest version, for example Windows 2000 or Windows XP. An upgraded operating system can clear out some of the malfunctioning software. If you cannot afford to upgrade, run some software checks to make sure no viruses exist. Get some good anti-virus software, such as the free version of Grisoft's AVG (http://free.grisoft.com /freeweb.php/doc/2/) or Panda's shareware download (pandasoftware.com/download/software/ ). Having too many applications or documents open at one time can cause your computer to crash, so close any you are not using. Alternatively, you could install more memory (RAM). Ask your computer retailer about this. If none of the above helps, make a note of any message boxes or numbers that appear when your computer crashes and enter this into Google's search engine. Other users may have written a useful guide about the problem on a message board or weblog. All of this is pointless, however, if your machine has frozen. Both Macs and PCs have a series of buttons you can press to force an application to quit or force your computer to reboot. On a PC, try holding down the \"ctrl+alt+delete\" buttons at the same time, and then release all three. This should bring up a box that will let you quit whichever application is causing the problem, or restart the whole computer. On an old Mac, try \"command+ctrl+restart\" or on a new one, depress the power button for at least five seconds. Above all, get into the habit of saving your work regularly. If you can't solve the problem, at least be prepared for it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
