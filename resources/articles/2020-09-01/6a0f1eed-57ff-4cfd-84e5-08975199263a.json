Although she looks back on it now as \u201cfun\u201d, at the time she was \u201cvery angry as a woman\u201d, she says. \u201cI had a period of about 10 years where I lived as a lesbian, and that was my identity,\u201d she said on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Desert Island Discs. \u201cI used to go on lesbian marches and I used to go clubbing and I had lots of relationships.\u201d The acclaimed writer, poet and playwright, who met her husband, the writer David Shannon, in 2006, explained that she had found the feminist movement \u201cquite exclusionary\u201d because it \u201cdidn\u2019t really accommodate black women\u201d. \u201cI was very much part of this counter-cultural, black feminist, say, or black womanist community, where we were just nurturing each other, as well as fighting each other and falling out, of course.\u201d The experience, she now believes, has left her stronger. Evaristo, 61, won the prestigious literary prize last year, alongside Margaret Atwood, for her novel Girl, Woman, Other, a complex story of the lives of 12 black women. Sharing the limelight with Atwood, who won for her novel The Testaments, did not make the accolade any less rewarding she claims: \u201cI will take the Booker prize any way it comes. I\u2019m just happy to have it. And also she (Atwood) is such a phenomenal woman.\u201d The writer, who grew up in Woolwich as one of eight children, said she appreciates the platform the prize has given her. \u201cI cannot be cool about it,\u201d said Evaristo. \u201cI have not compromised my politics or my creativity. Hopefully I am now changing [the establishment] from within.\u201d Yet the author said she will no longer agree to take part in any diversity panels organised by white cultural institutions. \u201cBut I can drop tweets which have even more impact actually. \u201cAnd anyway these organisations know what to do. They have to open the door. Yet the onus is always put on us, the people who have been shut out, to find a way in.\u201d Evaristo recalls that she was also \u201cnot always welcome in black spaces\u201d, because her mother, a teacher, was white. \u201cWe were called half-caste and it didn\u2019t seem like an insult then.\u201d Her Nigerian father was protective and told his children \u201calmost nothing\u201d about his roots. \u201cHe was absolutely scared for us,\u201d she recalls. Due to the attitudes of the era she regarded Africa \u201cas somewhere uncivilised and savage, not somewhere to be proud of\u201d. Evaristo recalled a moment from her childhood when she crossed the street to avoid her father. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to say hello to him because I didn\u2019t want to be associated with him. That feels terrible now but that\u2019s what it was like growing up in the 60s and 70s in a very white area. There was nothing around us to tell us being a person of colour was a good thing.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
