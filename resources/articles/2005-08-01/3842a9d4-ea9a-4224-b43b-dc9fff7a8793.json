Both sides are understood to be thrashing out a \u00a36.5bn deal, which is believed to be dogged by complicated tax issues. Mr Duffy refused to discuss any merger talks yesterday when he reported NTL's second-quarter results, which showed a 2.3% decline in overall revenues and a sharply lower operating loss. Yet his comments made it clear that the boss of the Nasdaq-listed company thought bulking up would help it compete with competitors such as satellite group BSkyB and BBC-backed Freeview. \"There's a whole bunch of 800lb gorillas in the competitive landscape in which we operate - ITV, Freeview, Sky and BT. And, while we are not a weakling, we are not an 800lb gorilla,\" he said. NTL has 3.3 million residential customers, against Sky's 7.8 million. Mr Duffy also reiterated his view that merging a distribution and content business did not necessarily work. \"I see relatively little [benefit] of integrating distribution and content, although there are notable exceptions.\" Telewest, which owns content provider Flextech, is understood to have sent out information memoranda for the division, which has been valued at between \u00a3500m and \u00a31bn. Mr Duffy's comments are not thought to preclude a combined group keeping Flextech, which owns channels such as Living TV and Bravo as well as UKTV, a joint-venture with the BBC which operates 11 digital subscription channels. Mr Duffy cited BSkyB, which owns channels such as Sky One and Sky Sports, as a good exception to the rule. \"There are times when it can work but most often it doesn't,\" he said. Media companies RTL, ITV and Sky have all expressed an interest in buying Flextech although several bankers have suggested that the auction is simply a ploy for Telewest to value the business in the complicated merger discussions. Mr Duffy said yesterday that NTL was \"confident\" it would return to growth after revenues from corporate customers fell 16.5% to \u00a3104m. Total sales fell 2% to \u00a3482.5m in spite of a 2.5% increase in its largest division - consumer sales. The bulk of the downturn was due to \u00a310.7m in business revenues changing to consumer sales as a result of NTL's acquisition of the rest of virgin.net last year. Losing an important contract with Vodafone to BT also hurt the top line. NTL signed up 66,600 new customers between April and June with a record quarter of 205,000 gross additions. The group returned to the black on an operating level with an income of \u00a36.4m compared with a loss of \u00a322.6m while losses from continuing operations improved from \u00a3267m to \u00a366m in the year. The turnaround was largely due to lower restructuring charges and gains from disposals during the year. NTL emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection two years ago. In the past year net debt has almost halved to \u00a31.5bn following a $1.4bn (\u00a3785m) rights offering, the $1.27bn sale of its broadcast division and recent disposal of its Irish business. Mr Duffy said yesterday he was pleased NTL had leapfrogged BT to provide broadband services to more customers. Shares in NTL edged up in morning trading in New York yesterday to just under $10."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
