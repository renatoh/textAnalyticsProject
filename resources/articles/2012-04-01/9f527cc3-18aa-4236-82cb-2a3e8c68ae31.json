But if there is one sound I would rather not hear in London on Sunday 5 August it is that of an apology from the once-golden girl, followed in the morning papers by pictures of a crumpled and tear-stained figure trapped amid a thicket of cameras and microphones. We had the latest in the series at the weekend, to follow those Radcliffe was forced to give after defeats in Sydney in 2000 (caused by tactical error), in Edmonton in 2001 (ditto, provoking a public row with her husband), in Athens in 2004 (side-effects of anti-inflammatories taken for an unpublicised calf injury), in Beijing in 2008 (aftermath of a stress fracture in her left femur) and in New York three years ago, when she ended the city's marathon in tears and pain from another previously concealed injury. In Vienna on Sunday, as she attempted a highly publicised half-marathon handicap against Haile Gebrselassie but ended up with the worst time over the distance of her entire life, the problem was bronchitis, for which she had been taking antibiotics. No wonder she couldn't match her own standards. \"I'm sorry,\" she told the promoter. The sight of a sobbing Paula has become a national clich\u00e9 and at this stage there are plenty of people \u2013 mostly outside sport \u2013 ready to arch an eyebrow and groan, \"Not again!\" Repeated proof of her increasing difficulty in meeting expectations on the grandest occasions has drained their reservoirs of sympathy for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2002. Sympathy for Radcliffe is not in short supply here. It is nine years since she stopped the clock at the figure by which history will remember her: a time of 2hr 15min 25sec in the 2003 London Marathon, the fastest in history by a woman, still unbeaten even by a pursuing horde that has included Catherine Ndereba, Gete Wami, Berhane Adere, Liliya Shobukhova and Mizuki Noguchi \u2013 women who have beaten her in major competitions, sometimes leaving her weeping in impotent agony, but have not come with minutes of her very best performance. Was it a one-off? Consider this: the next two best times in the all-time list also belong to the same runner, set in Chicago in 2002 and London in 2005, when Paula's 2hr 17min 42sec became the fastest ever recorded in a women-only race (in other words, without the notional pacing assistance provided by faster male runners). In Chicago last year Shobukhova came closest, with 2hr 18min 20sec. Even were someone to get below Radcliffe's mark in this Sunday's London Marathon, her achievement would still stand alongside Seb Coe's 800m record, set in Florence in 1981, which lasted 16 years. Given the bout of bronchitis, what on earth was she doing running in Vienna at all? One may as well ask why she ran in Athens, Beijing and New York. An athlete of Radcliffe's standing and celebrity is pressured in every respect, sporting and commercial, to turn up on the big day, even a competitor who suffered from asthma and anaemia as a girl and whose physiology so clearly remains vulnerable. And the big day is not always an Olympic final or a world championships. Sometimes it can be the sort of stunt we saw on Saturday, designed principally to satisfy the demands of promoters and sponsors. On such occasions I think back to a day in January 1993 and a rendezvous with the 19-year-old Radcliffe at Loughborough University, where she was in the process of acquiring a degree in modern European studies. A couple of weeks earlier, in the televised Durham international cross challenge, her first race as a senior athlete, she had finished a close second to Derartu Tulu and ahead of Elana Meyer, splitting the winners of gold and silver in the 10,000m at the Barcelona Games three months earlier. I had been present at that fantastic contest in the Montju\u00efc stadium and it was stirring to see an English teenager, the reigning world junior cross-country champion, racing them on equal terms. \"I'm not looking to make a living out of it,\" she told me that day in Loughborough, talking about the sport to which she had been introduced by her parents. \"Obviously it's nice that there's a bit of money coming in but that's not my goal.\" The room was decorated in a normal student way, with postcards and snapshots. Outside was parked her green VW Polo. Later that day I had a chat with her dad. \"She's a perfectionist,\" Peter Radcliffe said, \"which can be a frustrating existence.\" How prophetic those words turned out to be. Recently Radcliffe, now the mother of two children and extremely comfortably off, downgraded her own chances of crowning her career with a medal in London \u2013 even though, at 38, she is the age that Constantina Dita-Tomescu was when the Romanian pounded to victory on the pavements of Beijing four years ago, using the same front-running tactics on which the English athlete attempted to rely during her early years. Paula will be on the start line in The Mall, unless some serious misfortune intervenes, hiding her feelings behind those wraparound shades as she goes in search of the one accolade to have evaded her grasp. Let's not expect too much or be too harsh. She's done her bit. And whatever happens, there's no need to say sorry. richard.williams@ theguardian.com twitter.com/@rwilliams1947"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
