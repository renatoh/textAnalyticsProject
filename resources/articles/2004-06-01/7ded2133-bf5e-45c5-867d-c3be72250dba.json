The loss of Leeds and Newcastle to the Liberal Democrats is a major blow for Labour, which ran the metropolitan councils uninterrupted for 24 and 30 years respectively. The loss of Leeds will be a personal setback for Mr Blair, who launched his local election manifesto in the city. The prime minister will, however, take comfort from Ken Livingstone's victory in London, the Labour candidate was re-elected London mayor with a 161,202 majority. An electoral 'kicking' The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, admitted it was \"not a great day\" for Labour. He said the war in Iraq was a crucial factor, but he insisted the general election would be fought on the battleground of public services. \"People like those policies,\" he said. \"But they didn't judge this election on that. Iraq was a cloud, or indeed a shadow, over these elections. I am not saying we haven't had a kicking. It's not a great day for Labour.\" Speaking on BBC Radio 2, Mr Prescott said Labour now had to convince voters that its domestic policies were working. But he said the results provided little for the Tories to celebrate. \"Mr Howard is not capturing the councils he should have been capturing if he wants to make a break,\" he said. \"They haven't made a break-out.\" Confidence vote Mr Blair also received a vote of confidence this evening from his chancellor, Gordon Brown, the man many people would like to see replace him as prime minister. \"Labour will win the general election with Tony Blair,\" he told ITV News. \"We won the 1997 and 2001 elections, we are not complacent and we will fight the election with our positive policies on the health service, on education, on the economy, on full employment.\" Mr Brown's comments come after his former cabinet colleague, Clare Short, appealed to Mr Blair to stand down. Glimmer of hope for Labour One glimmer of success for the government was Sheffield, another Labour heartland and the constituency backyard of home secretary David Blunkett, which Labour managed to keep against expectations of a loss to the Liberal Democrats. Labour also took control of Hartlepool, Peter Mandelson's constituency, a previously hung council governed by elected mayor Stuart Drummond. North Tyneside, meanwhile, remains under no overall control. And Caerphilly also returned to Labour after five years under the control of Plaid Cymru. A Conservative revival? The Tory chairman, Liam Fox, however, claimed that the results were the \"worst performance by a governing party in electoral history\" and that they signalled an urban revival for the Conservatives. Michael Howard, Tory leader, described his party's performance as \"excellent\". \"We are represented in cities up and down the country, in areas we want to represent. I am about to go to Trafford where we had a notable victory last night. \"What I am really concerned about is that we should put this country on the right track again. I want a country in which people are large, where the state is small and in which we give everyone the kind of choices in health and education which today only people with money can buy.\" Share of the vote BBC projections show the Conservatives polling 38%, putting them within striking distance of a majority at a general election if the share of the vote was repeated. The Liberal Democrats are second on 30%, while Labour languished on 26%. According to results in so far, Labour has lost 464 councillors, and control of councils including Leeds, Newcastle, Trafford, Swansea and Burnley, St Helens, Bassetlaw and Ipswich. The Tories took an extra 263 seats and power in 12 more authorities, including Trafford, the first major metropolitan council to declare, as well as Tamworth, Harrogate and Eastbourne. The Lib Dems were up 132 seats but lost Norwich and Cheltenham. Lib Dems laud gains The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, lauded his party's share of votes and poured cold water on claims that the Conservatives were making a comeback under Mr Howard. Pointing to Mr Howard's claims that there must be no \"no-go areas\" for the Tories in inner cities, Mr Kennedy said: \"On the basis of the results so far, there are no elected Tories in Liverpool and Manchester, no elected Tories in Oxford. That is clearly not a resurgence of the Tory party\". The Lib Dem leader rebutted claims put to him by BBC Radio 4's Today programme that most of the party's gains had been at the expense of Labour. While the war in Iraq had \"cast a long shadow\" over the Labour party, Mr Kennedy insisted that Lib Dem gains in local elections were down to the party's call for the council tax to be scrapped in favour of a local income tax, coupled with its \"capacity for delivery\" in local government."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
