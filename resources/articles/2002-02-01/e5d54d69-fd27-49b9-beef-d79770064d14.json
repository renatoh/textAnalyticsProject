Ofsted's annual report, published today, said they perform less well than any other category of teacher, with less than half of their lessons being good or better, compared with two-thirds of the lessons of qualified and permanent members of staff. Mike Tomlinson, Ofsted chief inspector, urged the government to ensure that any \"loopholes\" in the vetting procedures applied by supply agencies were closed. Disquiet about supply teachers has been fuelled by the case of Canadian teacher Amy Gehring, acquitted yesterday of assaulting under-age pupils at a Surrey comprehensive. The supply agency which employed her has been severely criticised for not alerting the school or the Department for Education and Skills to problems at a previous school. She complained of having been used like a \"glorified babysitter\". Ofsted reported problems with the use of supply staff at both primary and secondary level. \"Supply staff, either from this country or abroad, often lack training in, and experience of, national teaching programmes and find it hard to fit into a school's well-established programme of teaching.\" One in 25 vacancies in secondary schools was filled by supply teachers, and inspectors reported this was damaging subjects such as modern languages, science, and religious education. Schools did not always give supply staff enough advice on lesson planning, teaching methods or how to manage behaviour, it added. \"Schools which support temporary and supply teachers well pay careful attention to continuity in what is taught and to the maintenance of agreed procedures on behaviour.\" The situation was worst in deprived areas, said Ofsted, adding: \"The proportion of poor teaching was considerably higher among temporary or supply teachers. \"In schools serving disadvantaged communities, one third of the lessons taught by these teachers was unsatisfactory or poor.\" Mr Tomlinson said one of the reasons why the quality of lessons taught by supply teachers was generally inferior was that they did not get the same level of training in literacy and numeracy strategies and catch-up programmes now being brought in for 11 to 14-year-olds. \"First of all, schools need to look at ways they support and provide material for supply teachers. Equally at local authority and national level we have to ask ourselves if we have these schoolteachers we need to ensure that they are best kept up to date with developments that they need to be aware of these days,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
