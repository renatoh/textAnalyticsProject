This is such a hugely important job of setting it up. It needs someone who has the support of all media sectors - and no political baggage.\" Monkey isn't sure that any candidates meet those criteria. \u00b7 Radio Times staff must have been thrilled to receive an email from the top brass last week boasting of a 10% rise in readership according to the NRS figures for October 2001 to March 2002. The email, sent the same day that the BBC announced the appointment of Gill Hudson as editor to replace Nigel Horne, makes no mention of Horne's regime. Which, funnily enough, began with his first \"own\" issue in October 2001 and ended when he left suddenly in April 2002. Monkey can only hope that the BBC has sent Nige a bottle of the champagne and string of bunting that it commends to all staff in recognition of the triumph. \u00b7 There was concern in Wapping when it emerged that ex-Sunday Times literary editor Harry Ritchie (who quit after friction with editor John Witherow) planned a novel portraying a Sunday newspaper. Happily, though, discretion seems to have dampened any vindictive impulses. In Friday Night Club, the Chronicle's editor - who changes section covers arbitrarily at the last moment, spikes book reviews by the likes of John Updike (\"find me a critic our readers might just have heard of\") and is ridiculed behind his back by staff who compile a list of household names that fail to register with him - is far too moronic for anyone to imagine he's modelled on a real media executive. Only his name, Jonathan Witherington, mischievously hints otherwise. \u00b7 Revealing Dan Corry's emails was the Indy's scoop, backed up by editorial thundering about \"character assassination\" and evildoing (\"as unacceptable as it was unpleasant\") exposing the dark heart of New Labour. One columnist, though, was unimpressed, implicitly rubbishing the story and the paper's verdict (\"I cannot, for the life of me, see what is wrong with the Corry emails\"). An envious lobby hack on a rival title? Nope, the Indy's own media pundit David Aaronovitch. \u00b7In Style (US) magazine, Press Gazette reveals, has been hit by a wedding curse that, by its swiftness of action, makes Hello!'s look relatively feeble. Among its victims are the actresses Drew Barrymore, Kelly Rutherford (Melrose Place) and Courtney Thorne-Smith (Ally McBeal) - all three in the divorce courts before the issues featuring their nuptials on the cover had even reached the newsstands. No UK magazine could compete with that, but July's Elle shows promising form, with cover star Jennifer Lopez talking up the marriage (\"We are really happy, I love my husband very much\") that last week she was reportedly offering $1m to walk out of. \u00b7 Heat editor Mark Frith's workload is expanding. Not only does he appear to harbour TV ambitions (achieving a career highlight by hosting Liquid News last week), a new string to his bow has emerged. Frith is a DJ in his spare time. But the Dreem Teem can rest easy behind their decks: he is more likely to be found spinning Kylie and Steps behind his mobile disco machine than pumping out trance and techno at Trade. \u00b7 \"More and more people are finding one career just isn't enough\" (Telegraph feature standfirst). Quite so. But juggling jobs isn't always easy: as when MP and Telegraph columnist Boris Johnson, wearing his third hat as Spectator editor, had to choose whether to show Peter Oborne's Spec article on the Black Rod hoo-ha to the Torygraph newsdesk. Alas, Boris had to say no: it was destined for the Evening Standard. All very awkward, as the Spec and Telegraph are sister titles. \u00b7 It seems that BBC entertainment chief Jane Lush \"definitely isn't after Chris Evans\" (Broadcast). Odd, then, that she's asked him out for lunch twice in the past fortnight; but perhaps she just wanted his views on South Korea's midfield?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
