Except in England, he added. To the rest of the world the field looks slightly different. \"But we can be dark horses, do you say that?\" Unlocking the stable doors at last, the coach revealed a line-up including a handful of prize thoroughbreds, a couple of faithful shire horses and one or two frisky creatures who previously toiled under the suspicion of being show ponies. It is, as we might have guessed, a squad that shows no particular prejudice in any direction, heaviest on players in their prime but also notable for balance at both ends of the spectrum of age and experience. And at the extremities among the outfield players stand Martin Keown and Joe Cole, respectively 35 and 20 years old, the symbols of Eriksson's catholic approach, in which space is found for innocence and fantasy alongside experience and pragmatism. Those who hoped, when Eriksson arrived just over a year ago, that the new coach would gamble on a total commitment to the promise of youth are confounded, above all, by the reappearance of Keown, one of five centre-backs on the list. He went to Arsenal as a 17-year-old apprentice in 1984, and after spells with Aston Villa and Everton he was recalled to Highbury by George Graham in 1993, alternating with Steve Bould as one of the famous back four alongside Tony Adams, Lee Dixon and Nigel Winterburn. His international career began 10 years ago and ended, he may have assumed, after he had earned his 40th cap in the vital final qualifying match against Greece last October. Despite an indifferent overall performance by the defence, he made two important blocks in the closing stages. Back in an Arsenal shirt early in the new year, however, he suffered a stress fracture of his leg. But after recovering he was recalled by Eriksson for last month's friendly match against Paraguay as a late replacement for Rio Ferdinand, and performed with unobtrusive efficiency until he was withdrawn at half-time, along with half the side. For Arsenal, he has deputised during the absences of both Adams and Sol Campbell this season. In Wednesday night's title-clinching match at Old Trafford he took the place of the injured Adams and put United's forwards under lock and key, demonstrating that he has lost none of the infuriating tenacity for which he has long been notorious among opposing forwards and their supporters. \"He can take out an opponent if you want,\" Eriksson told the media yesterday, and there was tittering from those fluent in the language of football, among whom the term \"to take out\" suggests a procedure only just short of amputation without anaesthetic. \"No,\" Eriksson interjected. \"I don't mean kicking. I mean marking. And you need a player like that.\" Keown is a specialist in one of football's less attractive but nevertheless essential arts. And in the Arsenal defender Eriksson has chosen a man who can not only play the game but also think about it, and specifically about his role in it, in terms not always employed by professional footballers. \"When you start off, everyone wants to be a centre-forward,\" Keown told a journalist five years ago, when he had just been recalled to the England squad by Glenn Hoddle after a five-year absence. \"But some of us end up having to defend. Then you have to man-mark as well. You can get satisfaction out of it. The better the player, the bigger the challenge - and it is very satisfying to shut quality players out of the game. It is still more enjoyable to play football.\" Sometimes he does that, too, although never losing his awareness of the priorities. \"I do pride myself on the defensive side of my game,\" he said more recently, \"but as a member of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's team you have to be able to pass the ball as well as win it.\" It was in the match against Paraguay that Joe Cole confirmed the belief that he can win the ball as well as pass it. Coming on for the second half to earn his fourth cap, he tackled and covered for absent colleagues when necessary, as well as expressing his remarkable creative instincts - otherwise known, principally to his critics, as \"doing his tricks\". He had done all that against Italy, too, a few weeks earlier, setting up England's goal with a dogged run. But he had also conceded possession in a dangerous area, a mistake which led directly to Italy's equaliser. Against Paraguay there was no such sloppiness. Coaches like players who learn from their mistakes. Cole played in the very first game Eriksson saw after taking over as England coach, a 2-0 home defeat for West Ham at the hands of Sunderland on January 13 2001. The young midfielder had tackled back in that match, too, although his role in Harry Redknapp's favoured five-man midfield was more opaque than it became later in the year when Glenn Roeder, Redknapp's successor, adopted the 4-4-2 also preferred by the England coach. \"He has something special,\" Eriksson said yesterday, perhaps remembering the pass, played with his right foot twisted behind his left, with which Cole sent Paolo di Canio in for a shot against the post that day. \"He can change things on the pitch when he comes on... Or even when he starts,\" Eriksson added, speedily covering himself. Roeder may have been tempting fate yesterday when he reached for a comparison with the flowering of the 18-year-old Pele in Sweden in 1958 while speculating on the kind of impact Cole could make in the Far East. But he was right to observe that most World Cup finals witness the emergence of a brilliant young player, and there is no reason to suppose that any of this year's finalists possesses a more gifted 20-year-old. Or a more resolute 35-year-old, come to that. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
