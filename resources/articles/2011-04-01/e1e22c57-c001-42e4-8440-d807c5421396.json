I worked as a fraud investigator for Jobcentre Plus until last summer when I resigned over the micro-management culture setting virtually unachieveable targets aimed at specific offences. All investigators are encouraged \u2013 nay, threatened \u2013 to only investigate allegations of fraud by lone parents with undeclared partners allegedly living with them. Far more potentially serious cases of undeclared work or fake disability are pushed to one side, as managers exhort their teams to look into these types of investigations. This often results in investigators resorting to underhand tactics to \"persuade\" lone parents that they had or have a partner living with them. The early morning visit at the weekend that catches a benefit claimant with a boyfriend staying over for instance: job done and another tick in the box towards this year's living-together target. Investigators that fall behind their target profile by mid-year are threatened with the laughably termed \"performance improvement plan\" (monitoring to you and me), so it's no wonder that they sometimes resort to nefarious deeds to boost their figures. There are a lot of good investigators in Jobcentre Plus who can achieve successful prosecutions where appropriate by doing it legally and proportionately, but some who may be less experienced are under pressure. Any defence solicitor or welfare rights advocate can seriously undermine an investigation by asking on tape how far behind his or her \"living-together target\" the investigator is. Name and address withheld \u2022\u2008Your article on jobseekers being tricked out of benefits was of great interest to me. In fact it helped prove a theory I had regarding my son who has suffered the same sanctions as the benefit claimant John featured in your piece. I believe my son was targeted not just for his vulnerability, but also because he would be the least likely to appeal given his inability to handle confrontation and stress. My 26-year-old son has suffered from mental health problems since he was 20. He is prescribed medication to counteract depression and mild schizophrenia, but despite all this has, until recently, managed to attend college and hold down a job. He signed on for jobseeker's allowance some five months ago and was recently sanctioned in February for missing an appointment, and told his JSA would be stopped until 24 June. I say \"told\"; he found out like John when no money appeared in his bank account. He subsequently had to apply for hardship payment \u2013 \u00a339 per week, which is now the only money he receives. I note the comments by the DWP spokesman, denying the targeting of vulnerable claimants. However, my son's treatment says otherwise. Mark Skilton Swansea, West Glamorgan \u2022\u2008Refugees are another group of claimants highly vulnerable to being sanctioned. A Sudanese refugee I know, who arrived in the UK eight months ago, failed to answer one of his jobcentre adviser's questions correctly because of his lack of English and has now lost his only income. His housing benefit is also likely to be affected which, in the longer term, could also make him homeless. An interpreter was not available. Maggie Jones Nottingham \u2022\u2008My son has been seeking employment since finishing a job last spring (Editorial, 9 April). He has found opportunities for unpaid but relevant workplace experience which will bolster his CV. However, the jobcentre has forbidden him from taking up these short-term internships. Instead he must go on its six-week course with a company that has the franchise to train jobseekers. This is daft. He already knows how to write a CV and any internships that it offers will be limited to its client companies, whether relevant to him or not. He is being actively prevented from using his own initiative so that the jobcentre can tick boxes and meet targets.
