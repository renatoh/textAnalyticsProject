Lindegaard has found his first-team opportunities limited. Last season he made only three appearances, with the Dane having been permanently demoted to being David De Gea\u2019s back-up since a 4-3 win over Reading in December 2012 that effectively ended the chance handed to him by Sir Alex Ferguson to claim the No1 jersey for himself. Michael Stensgaard, his agent, told the Guardian: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a very good dialogue with Man United and we talked about the prospect of [Anders] getting the chance to play and, obviously with De Gea [there], the prospect that Anders should go out and find a club where he should play. We sort of agreed that we could look into opportunities. So it\u2019s not that United are kicking him out or anything. It\u2019s a very constructive dialogue on how the future should look. Then in good co-operation we agreed that we would look into the opportunities. \u201cThe most important thing is that it\u2019s the right thing for Anders and the right thing for the club as well \u2013 that\u2019s very important.\u201d Asked about reports that Lindegaard had been released, Stensgaard said: \u201cNo. It has absolutely nothing to do with the truth. We\u2019ve had a very good dialogue. If the case is that we do not find the right club both for Anders and for Man United \u2013 because this is very important \u2013 then Anders will stay and he\u2019ll have his heart at the club. He\u2019s a lifelong Man United fan and he\u2019s very loyal to the club.\u201d Stensgaard would not be drawn on whether his client has so far had any offers from another club. \u201cNo, we keep that [to ourselves] internally.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
