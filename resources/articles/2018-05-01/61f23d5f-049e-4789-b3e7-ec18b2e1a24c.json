The striker was kept quiet by United\u2019s Chris Smalling at Wembley and after the game, which United won 2-1, the official FA Cup account tweeted: \u201cWhat\u2019s that in your pocket, Chris?\u201d and linked to an unrelated video of the defender saying: \u201cHarry Kane.\u201d The tweet was deleted and the FA apologised to Tottenham and United \u201cfor any offence caused\u201d. Mauricio Pochettino, Tottenham\u2019s manager, branded the game\u2019s governing body an embarrassment last week. Kane is relaxed about the issue but he pointed out it was an odd way for the FA to treat one of its own. \u201cThe FA tweet was a silly tweet,\u201d Kane said. \u201cWe all know that. I talked to the gaffer about it and all we said was: \u2018Would other countries do that to their players?\u2019 Probably not. \u201cIt is something that has gone. Two weeks ago now or whatever \u2013 I am over it. The gaffer may have said I am sad but I am focused. I am a guy that gets over things. If it happened, it happened. I move on and look forward to the next game and that is all I worry about.\u201d Kane, who scored his 38th goal of the season in Tottenham\u2019s 2-0 win over Watford on Monday, added that England players receive too much flak at times. \u201cIt\u2019s strange,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a mentality thing. It is easier nowadays maybe to banter England players or take the mickey out of the England players. So if we don\u2019t do well in the World Cup, then they can write and say: \u2018We told you so.\u2019 But that is maybe a weaker mentality. \u201cIt is what it is. We are focusing on what we have got to do. We have got to go with the mindset and belief we can do it. We try to win everything we go into. The World Cup is no different.\u201d Kane has been the butt of a few jokes since fighting to be credited with a goal that brushed off him against Stoke on 7 April. However he has no plans to step away from social media. \u201cOn social media you get a few people who don\u2019t see eye to eye and it is being a fan and having an opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cI will always engage with my fans. It is just a small number of fans who maybe go over the mark but that is just life. You cannot get too down about that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
