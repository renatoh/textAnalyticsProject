Although Redknapp had no complaints with Tanner sending off Beno\u00eet Assou-Ekotto for a first-half lunge on Gianni Zuiverloon, he was furious with the referee's failure to punish Roman Bednar after the forward appeared to push Michael Dawson before heading home the opening goal. \"I couldn't even put into words what I thought of [Tanner's] performance,\" said Redknapp. \"I'll be honest with you, I walked into the referee's room before the game and saw who was refereeing and I really knew what was coming. \"I've had him many times before and I know what he's like. He's really not good enough. He's just a poor referee and I've seen him make a mess of so many games before that it didn't surprise me. I don't complain about referees. I never, ever walk in after a game and complain about a referee. I haven't done for years. But this guy today was scary. He's not up to the Premier League.\" Redknapp highlighted two incidents that angered him most, the first coming just before Assou-Ekotto's red card. \"Darren Bent chases a ball and the big centre-half comes out and clatters him, and he gives a throw-in and he doesn't see it. Michael Dawson gets pushed in the back on the first goal and he doesn't see it. What do you think Dawson has flown through the air for when he's headed every ball? Everybody sees he got pushed apart from the referee.\"Bad habits die hard, however, and Tottenham are in danger of slipping back into their old ways after this sobering defeat left Redknapp and his players entrenched in a relegation battle. Yet even with 11 men Tottenham had looked flat and bereft of ideas. Indeed, it says everything about their performance that Heurelho Gomes was comfortably their best player, the Brazilian goalkeeper producing three fine saves from free-kicks before Bednar, nodding home his sixth goal of the season, and the substitute Craig Beattie, found a way through. It would be exaggerating the extent of Spurs' malaise to draw parallels with the team's form under the Juande Ramos regime, although one win in six league matches suggests that the players are no longer performing with the same freedom and spirit that characterised the early days under Redknapp. In the 34 minutes before Assou-Ekotto's red card Tottenham threatened only once and thereafter a stalemate with the Premier League's bottom club was the limit of their ambitions. That objective might well have been achieved but Bednar's late header left Spurs empty-handed and Redknapp incandescent. It was easy to understand the manager's frustration, although it must be said that Dawson flew through the air as if he had been given a boot up the backside rather than the alleged nudge in the back. Bednar carried on regardless, heading the excellent Marek Cech's diagonal ball beyond Gomes as Tottenham's coaching staff railed at the fourth official. Until the first goal Albion had failed to make the most of their numerical advantage, one that even Redknapp thought was merited, giving the referee at least some credit for dismissing Assou-Ekotto. \"I thought it was a sending off,\" he said. \"I thought he turned his back and put his foot in.\" For Albion the relief was tangible. This second victory in three matches lifts them to within two points of Tottenham and safety after a chastening sequence ofa run of 10 matches without a win. Tony Mowbray maintained his players \"have never stopped believing we have the qualities to get enough points to stay in the league\" and pointed to the remaining home fixtures, which will see many of those struggling against relegation visit The Hawthorns, as a reason to be optimistic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
