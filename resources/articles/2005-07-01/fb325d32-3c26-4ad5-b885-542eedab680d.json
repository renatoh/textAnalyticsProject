The group revealed a strong increase in the order book to almost \u00a322bn, a 54% rise in underlying pre-tax profits to \u00a3260m, sharply lower net debt and a 5% boost for the dividend. Coupled with a confident statement from chief executive Sir John Rose on the outlook for the second half of the year, the news saw the shares rise more than 8% to 338p, making the stock the day's biggest gainer in the FTSE 100 share index. Rolls-Royce said that the civil aerospace business, which provides engines for both the big civil aircraft makers, Airbus and Boeing, had lifted underlying profit before financing costs to \u00a3200m -more than double the previous year's performance. After market sales, which include replacement parts for engines already in service, accounting for 59% of the division's sales. The defence business, where the US Department of Defense is the largest customer, saw profits up from \u00a312m to \u00a394m. Marine profits rose \u00a34m to \u00a339m though the energy sector remained little above break even as the group spends the profits earned in the oil and gas sector building up its presence in power generation. Sir John said the decision to increase the dividend had not been taken under pressure from investors disappointed that the move had not come earlier. \"We were keen to find an opportunity to raise the dividend and also that the company kept a strong balance sheet. We ... thought this was the right time to do it.\" Sir John said Rolls-Royce was expecting further progress. \"We remain on target to generate continued growth in profits and reduction of average net debt in 2005.\" The results were well received in the City. \"We expect to increase our 2005 and long-term estimates to take into account stronger than expected growth in global air traffic and a sustained upturn in aircraft deliveries,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Scott Babka said in a report after the results. CSFB analyst Steve East said: \"The commercial aerospace cycle upturn is now coming through and we believe this should drive a strong earnings recovery through to 2007.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
