Some 30 fans have said they hold Tristante Oliva, together with the Spanish football federation, responsible for \"the penalty mistake\" and have demanded one euro per person for causing them distress. \"We want the error to be publicly acknowledged and compensation paid as professional negligence has been committed,\" said Andr\u00e9s Sanch\u00eds, the lawyer representing the supporters. Tristante Oliva ruled that the defender Carlos Marchena had fouled Ra\u00fal Gonz\u00e1lez in injury time, with Valencia leading 1-0 and about to rise above Madrid into top place in the table. Luis Figo converted the kick. The Brazil striker Ronaldo has denied any interest in joining Chelsea and repeated his desire to stay with Real Madrid. Ronaldo has scored 19 goals in the Spanish league this season and insists he is staying put. \"I have heard some English clubs are interested in me, but nobody has said anything to me officially,\" he said. \"Chelsea? I am not moving from Madrid; I am very happy there.\" Ailton, the Bundesliga's leading scorer with 19 goals, has promised to marry his companion in a public ceremony at the Werder Bremen stadium if his club win the German championship. \"If I become German champion, then Rosalie and I will marry on the pitch. And all the fans are invited,\" said the Brazilian. Bremen are nine points clear in the league. Bayern Munich's chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge says his club have virtually no chance of beating Real Madrid when the two sides meet over two legs in the last 16 of the Champions League. \"For Bayern to make it through to the quarter-finals, Real Madrid will have to have two very bad days and we will have to play two really good games,\" said Rummenigge. Jaap Stam has said he would only consider a move to one of the Milan clubs if he left Lazio. Lazio said this week that they would consider offers for the 31-year-old defender after he rejected talks on extending his contract beyond June 2005. \"I've got the greatest respect for Juventus, but a move there doesn't interest me,\" said Stam, whose agent hinted yesterday that he was on the verge of joining Milan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
