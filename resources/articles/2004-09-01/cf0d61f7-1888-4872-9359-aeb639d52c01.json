Research has shown that dogs who live with smokers have a higher incidence of asthma, nasal and sinus and lung cancer. The sedentary lifestyle of cats means they are even more at risk, being twice as likely to develop some forms of cancer, including lymphoma, which is the most common tumour in cats and kills three in four within a year of being diagnosed. Just last month, Essex couple Kevin Barclay and Sharon Wood quit their 20-a-day habit to save the life of JJ, their pet parrot, who was suffering from wheezing. Within two weeks of their stopping smoking, JJ was breathing normally again. Asda Pet Insurance points out that passive smoking can contribute to the cost of keeping pets, as the average cost of a visit to the vet is \u00a3150, with one in five visits costing \u00a3200 or more. No doubt the message from Asda is: if you must carry on smoking, consider buying pet insurance. Call 0845 300 5772 for a quote. First things first First Direct is the best mortgage provider and Egg the worst, according to a new customer feedback poll live on Interactive Investor.

On credit cards,Tesco's customers rated its card top overall, while Abbey's scored nothing for value, convenience and service. Ouch! It's guaranteed Investors will earn 105 per cent of any growth in the FTSE 100 index over five years with a new guaranteed equity bond from National Savings and Investments. There's no cap on the return you can earn, but it is subject to income tax in 2009 and must be declared to the Inland Revenue. The bond, which is backed by the Treasury, offers complete capital protection, so even if the FTSE 100 falls below its starting level on 10 November, investors will still get all their original investment back. Fees and charges are built into the 105 per cent return. NI&amp;S has set a min imum of \u00a31,000, and the bond goes on sale from 15 September until 9 November, although if you are interested you should try to get your money in early as NS&amp;I warns that it will withdraw the offer when fully subscribed. Money invested early will earn 4 per cent gross during the eight week offer period. Apply by phone with a debit card on 0500 500 000 or by post using an application form which can be downloaded from NS&amp;I's website at www.nsandi.com.

Poor Londoners Readers in the rest of the country might think that Londoners are over-loud, overpaid and over-exposed in the media, but now the truth is out. They're just trying to compensate for the comparative poverty that they endure compared with those living in comfort outside the capital. Londoners are among the most cash-poor people in England, scraping by with little more than \u00a350 spare cash a week after bills have been paid, according to research by fund supermarket Cofunds. A poll of 2,000 Brits revealed that, after bills, the average Londoner had \u00a3208 to live on for the month. Despite the cost of commuting, people in the South East had the biggest excess each month with an average of \u00a3288.69. Those in the South West and East Anglia were next best off, with average disposable income of \u00a3257, while people living in Yorkshire and the Midlands have on average \u00a3220 to \u00a3225 to spare. Only those in the North West were as badly off as Londoners. Rick Andrews of Cofunds said: 'The cost of living is taking its toll on Londoners and our findings destroy any notion of a north-south divide when it comes to the nation's wealth gap.' Rates on up and up Homeowners may be breathing sighs of relief that interest rates are not going up again this month, but don't take it as a sign that it's safe to get your credit cards out again. Economists expect a further quarter per cent jump before Christmas, and some think that there could be a further series of rises next year if property price increases don't slow dramatically. Barry Naisbitt, the chief economist at Abbey, says it all depends on how the Bank of England views economic growth prospects. 'It expects growth to be strong in the short term, but for it to slow over 2005, which suggests interest rates could peak in the middle of the year.' Martin Ellis, the chief economist at the Halifax, expects an interest rate rise in November when the next inflation report comes out, but says that the five interest rate rises are now taking their toll on house-price inflation. But he warns: 'We'll have to wait and see if this slowdown is sustained or whether it's a false dusk.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
