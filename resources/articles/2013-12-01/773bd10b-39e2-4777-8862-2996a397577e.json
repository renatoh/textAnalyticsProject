The 44-year-old has been assigned control of the first-team since Monday's dismissal of Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas and will take charge for Sunday's Premier League trip to Southampton. He is determined to use the opportunity to launch a managerial career. Sherwood played for Spurs between 1999 and 2003 and has been on the club's coaching staff since being hired by Harry Redknapp in 2008. He was serving as technical co-ordinator until his sudden promotion following Villas-Boas's departure and led a senior team for the first time in Wednesday's Capital Cup defeat to West Ham. The club's chairman, Daniel Levy, has not yet given Sherwood any indication as to the likely duration of his caretaker assignment, nor confirmed that he is in contention for a permanent appointment. Sherwood is in no doubt that he would relish a chance to discuss the job and his potential role in the club's future. He is undaunted by the fact that Tottenham have been linked with an array of managers with far more glittering CVs. \"They are all good guys, all good managers,\" he said. \"It has got to fit, the club and the manager, to be compatible. It's not always about the biggest name. He might have done well at another club but he might not do well at this one. It is up to the chairman and the board to make the correct decision which is right for the long-term future of the club. \"It's not right to keep changing managers \u2026 I know all about the football club. I played here, it's my club. I know what the supporters want. I know what they demand. I know the players we have got here and I know the good young talent that is coming through the club. I need to talk about philosophies, what we are looking to do: buy players or bring them through?\" The Ajax manager, Frank de Boer, has reportedly rejected overtures from Spurs, Michael Laudrup has announced that he does not wish to leave Swansea City and Southampton's Mauricio Pochettino has denied that he has had contact from Spurs and insisted he is happy at St Mary's, where he enjoys a positive relationship with the chairman, Nicola Cortese. \"As a manager what's really important is that the sporting aspect is under my control, in terms of signings,\" Pochettino said. \"Without my agreement no signings go through, and those two basic things are very important for any manager.\" That might not be the case at White Hart Lane, where the technical director, Franco Baldini, is the biggest influence on transfer policy. Sherwood says that would not deter him from accepting the job of manager and suggested that is one way in which his inexperience could be an advantage: \"I've never known anything different as I've never managed without one. I'm open-minded to it. My style of management would just have to evolve.\" Sherwood, who said he would not accept serving as a No2 to another manager, intimated that he could have a similar effect on Tottenham to the one that Brendan Rodgers has had at Liverpool, the club whose 5-0 triumph at White Hart Lane last Sunday triggered the ejector seat under Villas-Boas. \"From what I've been doing and my experience, I think I'd be a long-term appointment but I'm realistic enough to know that you can't just lose games,\" he said. \"I don't want to insult the intelligence of the punters by saying: 'Don't worry, I'll turn it around in a minute.' They ain't got time for that. It's about the club sticking with you. I think Brendan [Rodgers] is a good example of that. He's done it at Liverpool. The sun wasn't always shining there but it seems like he's turned it around now and is doing very well. \"I'm just getting on with the job and trying to enjoy it as much as I can. We will have to speak about long-term with the chairman \u2013 it is his decision. If it was down to me I'd be getting a 10-year contract now but football doesn't work like that. It is all about getting results. I listen to managers all the time talk about 'the project'. The project is you win games or you get sacked \u2013 end of story.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
