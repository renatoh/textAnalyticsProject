His 10th studio album is true to form, often lovely, perhaps too often familiar. There are reference points from across American music: John Fahey (Stevens\u2019 Snow Man), a featherlight cover of the 1940s standard Along the Santa Fe Trail, and the perpetual sound of twangy guitars and reverbed vocals. But Migration Stories is at its most appealing when Ward stretches his legs a little, such as when he tiptoes around the edges of alt-rock and brings in synths on Unreal City, where his facility with melody and arrangement means he doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s stepping outside his comfort zone so much as pushing its boundaries outwards; or when he gives the ballad Real Silence a synthetic throb that pushes it gently in the direction of Cigarettes After Sex; or Independent Man, where lambent sax alters the mood. There is, though, the unmistakable sense that if you already love M Ward, you\u2019ll love Migration Stories, but that if you\u2019re not already converted you might just as well stick a pin anywhere in his discography and start there (I\u2019d go with 2005\u2019s Transistor Radio). After 10 albums it\u2019s hard to surprise, and Ward isn\u2019t the first artist with a distinct style to encounter that issue."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
