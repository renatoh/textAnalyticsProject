Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, obviously agrees. He told a Newspaper Society conference that the regional and local press \"is much more relevant to our day-to-day lives than the national press.\" And Tim Bowdler, chief executive of Johnston Press, argued that with the fragmentation of other media local papers - whether in print or on the web - provide advertisers with \"the best way\" of targeting audiences.
