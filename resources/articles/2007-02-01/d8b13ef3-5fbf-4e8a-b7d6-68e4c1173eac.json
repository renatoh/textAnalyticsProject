If Corus shareholders back the deal, Tata Steel is set to become the world's fifth-biggest steelmaker. The company is offering 608p a share, topping a 603p bid from its rival suitor, the Brazilian company CSN. The deal values Corus equity at \u00a36.2bn, which, coupled with some \u00a3500m of debt, puts the enterprise value at \u00a36.7bn. CSN will not go away entirely empty handed; it is in line for a break fee of more than \u00a360m. The acquisition restores the Tata group to its traditional place as India's biggest company, with a market capitalisation of 2,700bn rupees (\u00a333bn), and it puts the company on the brink of clinching India's biggest foreign takeover. However, enthusiasm for Tata's strategy was not universal. Tata Steel's shares slumped almost 11% on the deal with traders warning that the company was paying too much. Its opening offer had been pitched at 455p a share but was raised to \u00a35 after CSN indicated its interest. Ratan Tata, the chairman of the Tata group, defended the 608p price tag, saying Corus represented a \"unique opportunity\" for the Indian company. \"Quite frankly I do feel [the stock market] is taking a short-term and harsh view. In the future somebody will look back and say we did the right thing. Corus is a unique opportunity for us in terms of scale, location and culture. This is a key part of our global strategy.\" Analysts said that Tata's bid was nine times Corus's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), a figure that dwarfed the 6.2 times Mittal Steel paid for Arcelor to create the world's biggest steel producer. However, banking sources close to the Tata camp argued that Tata was paying $700 (\u00a3357) for each tonne of steel production compared with $670 in the Mittal-Arcelor deal and $1,000 a tonne in a recent US deal. Mr Muthuraman accepted the deal \"may look expensive\" but said it would triple the company's capacity from 8.7m tonnes to almost 28m tonnes a year at half the cost of building new plants. He added that within three years it would add $300m to $350m a year to net profit. Steel prices would rise driven by demand from the sustained, explosive growth in the biggest markets in the developing world: India and China. \"Both of these two will need to be built up.\" In response to questions about possible job cuts at Corus, Mr Muthuraman said that the steelmaker was not as competitive as it should be. \"This is not about cutting jobs. The company has to be made more competitive so jobs can be secured.\" British unions are keen to open talks with Tata about its plans for the British plants. \"Tata will be inheriting a profitable, well-run company with, in the case of its UK operations, some of the most efficient steelworkers in the world,\" said Michael Leahy, Community's general secretary. \"We are willing to work in partnership to drive forward an investment strategy which allows the UK operations to contribute further to the profitability of Tata. However, what we are not prepared to accept is to see the accelerated or slow demise of the UK steel industry. Tata should be under no illusions that we will resist any attempt to achieve this using all the resources at our disposal.\" Corus's chairman Jim Leng will become the group's deputy chairman. Mr Tata added that he intended to leave the running of Corus, led by chief Philippe Varin, to its existing executives. CSN and Tata Steel are both smaller than Corus, leading to questions about why the Anglo-Dutch group was the target, not the buyer. \"We would love to have bought either,\" said Mr Leng, \"but, as you know, neither of them was for sale.\" The Corus acquisition underlines the ambition of the cash-rich Tata group, which aims to become a global conglomerate along the lines of General Electric. Its business empire already spans tea, hotels, cars and India's biggest software firm.
