A few more lines around the eyes on his permanently orange-tanned face perhaps, but he is as square-jawed, guardsman- straight as ever and flea-fit with his impeccable standards and creases that could slice carpaccio. It is as if Cliff Richard has handed down his secret of eternal youth, which is fine as long as Stewart doesn't gatecrash the grandstand during a rainy day at Lord's and regale the crowd with his greatest hits. Four years ago in Australia, on his third visit for an Ashes series, he was England's gaffer in every sense: captain of the side in the country he loves second only to his own, and scorer of a century in Melbourne which contributed to a win that, though the Ashes had gone, kept the series alive until the last match. This time around, though, he has been an anonymous figure, growling out encouragement to his bowlers from behind the stumps certainly, but leader of the pack no more from the top of the order. In Brisbane, at No6, he batted for a total of three balls for his first pair in Tests -\"Bizarre,\" he said yesterday. \"You have to take that sort of thing on the chin\" - and did not even play in Hobart last weekend, believing it would be his last match off until the World Cup is done and dusted. There is something of a paradox about him. Here is the fellow who because of the cricket he played in Perth during his formative years is regarded in England as the quintessential Aussie-type cricketer who plays it for keeps, no quarter given, none asked. He wants nothing more, at the seventh time of asking, than to beat the Australians, but fears they have upped the ante even from last year in England, when he played in what he considered was the most one-sided contest of his career. Yet there are those in the Australian team who see him as a soft touch for a player with his overall record. The statistics tend to support the view that when confronted with the greatest challenge in the game he has fallen short. This week's second Test in Adelaide will be his 31st Ashes match, precisely one quarter of his total appearances, and in that time he has averaged 28.04 runs per innings, compared with almost 37 against West Indies, Courtney Walsh, Curtly Ambrose et al, and 39.6 in his career overall. Of his 15 centuries, only that Melbourne knock has been achieved against Australia. It is an even gloomier picture in Australia itself where a player who ought to thrive on the bounce, pace - back foot, stump-high and above is his bread and butter - and general quality of the pitches has been restricted in 13 matches and 26 innings to only 25.54 per innings. On that basis, the reasons for picking Stewart for what is unquestionably his last hurrah were not compelling except that the competition has not been quick to state a case. He still keeps wicket as immaculately as he dresses and as such is the team's premier all-rounder. The problem is how to get the best out of him with the bat. Movement down the order - he would call it demotion, others a sensible prolonging of his career - robs him of his greatest talent, namely attacking the hard new ball with the field up, unless he goes sufficiently far to bring the second new ball into play. His play against spin has improved a little over the past few years as a result of no longer opening, plus series in Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka, but the Australians still know he has got out too often to Shane Warne, Stuart MacGill and even Colin Miller and Mark Waugh. Perhaps expectations are too high. The idea that a batsman approaching 40 is going to be able to play with the same panache and flair as in his pomp simply does not stand up. The gimlet-eyed bloke in the white helmet who stood tall in Barbados and smashed Walsh and Ambrose for a hundred in each innings, the only Englishman to do so against West Indies, is not around any longer. For this coming Test, if the weather stays reasonably cool and England can put their faith in only four front-line bowlers, he will drop down the order yet again to seven, a position in which he has batted only five times without a night watchman having preceded him. It is a different discipline there, alien to him and demanding that he shepherd a tail which is at best unreliable. But even in that place there must be one last rousing performance, for just as Adam Gilchrist creates a stir coming in at seven, so to some extent, even to Australian eyes, must a man who is within 81 runs of becoming the fourth Englishman to 8,000 runs.
