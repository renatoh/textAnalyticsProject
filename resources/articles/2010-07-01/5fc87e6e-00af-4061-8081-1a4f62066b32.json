But few believe a complete withdrawal is imminent. And the western mission faces several milestones that may determine success or failure: \u2022 Ramadan 11 August The holy month of fasting and prayer is traditionally a time when both militants and government troops slow the fight. That augurs badly for surging US troops wishing to press their battlefield advantage. \u2022 Parliamentary elections 18 September President Hamid Karzai has insisted on holding the vote, delayed from May, even though many areas are insecure and widespread poll rigging is feared. Securing ballot boxes will divert Afghan soldiers from fighting the Taliban, highlighting the gulf between the political and military strategies. \u2022 Nato summit November The international community hopes to identify provinces where western militaries can transfer control to Afghan security forces \"sometime in 2011\". But that will depend largely on the fragile, sometimes chaotic Afghan army and police forces. \u2022 Winter December to March Obama's 30,000-troop surge will have fully deployed by the time the harsh winter sets in. In recent years fighting has continued through the cold season, but at a reduced level. A senior Nato officer said the military \"would have to show some convincing stories\" by October. \u2022 Congressional Assessment January 2011 Progress (or lack thereof) in Afghanistan will come under sharp political scrutiny in the run up to Obama's annual State of the Union address. \u2022 US withdrawal July 2011 Vice-president Joe Biden recently confirmed that Obama's July date was \"firm\", although it is likely the withdrawal will be staggered over several years. He faces growing public impatience. A recent poll found that 43% of Americans feel the war is worth fighting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
