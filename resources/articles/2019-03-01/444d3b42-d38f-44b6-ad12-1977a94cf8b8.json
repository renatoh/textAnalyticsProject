Pep Guardiola\u2019s team will discover on Friday whom they face and Silva hopes to avoid his international teammate. Ronaldo scored a 52nd career hat-trick as Juventus overturned a 2-0 deficit against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid to progress. Asked about facing Ronaldo, Silva said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t like it very much, to be honest. I know him, I know what he\u2019s capable of and once again tonight he proved it.\u201d Silva is conscious, though, that City may have to face a proven Champions League force. \u201cWhen you are playing in a competition like this you have to know that you can get drawn against these kind of teams, these kind of players,\u201d the forward said. \u201cIt is a good thing. It means you are playing the best competitions, the best games and we will see who we are playing against. Of course to play against Cristiano and [Barcelona\u2019s Lionel] Messi it is always complicated.\u201d Guardiola has described Silva as Portugal\u2019s best player, apparently ranking him above Ronaldo. \u201cI think people interpreted things a little different to what he meant,\u201d Silva said. \u201cOf course Cristiano, what he has done in over the last 15 years in football is probably one of the best players ever in the history of football, so no comparison to him.\u201d Asked whether Ronaldo had mentioned this to him Silva said: \u201cNo, not yet.\u201d City beat Schalke 7-0 at the Etihad Stadium to win the tie 10-2 on aggregate. Silva believes it is too soon to talk up City\u2019s chances but said: \u201cWe have big ambition to do as well as possible in this competition because we know we have a good team.\u201d Silva has signed a three-year contract extension to 2025, having joined from Monaco in summer 2017 for \u00a342m. He said: \u201cAs soon as I heard City wanted me to stay longer, my mind was made up. I love the club, the manager, players and the fans.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
