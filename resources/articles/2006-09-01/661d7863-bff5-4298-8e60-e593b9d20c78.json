The article generated a number of posts on his blog. Here are some edited extracts. Reynolds: I'm in the Guardian today, apparently a big piece that I haven't seen yet as I'm still lounging around in bed. Sue: That's a great article in the Guardian, makes me want to bring you a big bag of tea bags and biscuits! Sage303: Brilliant article full of wit and wisdom, especially liked the \"didn't go into teaching because don't like kids, but like sticking them with needles\". Nick Francis: They've even posted a lovely picture of you ... What happened to the warm blanket of anonymity? J: By the way, you look cute in the Guardian photo. The Bunslinger: Reynolds for prime minister, I say. mgatlin: Dare I say, you are so cute. Reynolds: I blush from all the shortsighted people and their kindness of lying and saying I look cute. VTEMT: It must be hard to get back in the ambulance after such celebrity. How long before a patient recognises you: \"Oi, you're that Tom Reynolds geezer, can I have your autograph?\" Magwitch: So you were at Chase Farm. Now I realise that's where I've seen/met you before. Used to take the occasional patient there during my time. TPAC: And he treated both myself and hubby while he was there, he is a really nice bloke! www.randomreality.blogware.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
