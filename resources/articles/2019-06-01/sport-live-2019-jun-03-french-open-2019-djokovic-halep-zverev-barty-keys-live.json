I have good energy in Paris [he won the Masters here last November], the people like me\u201d he adds with a wry smile. The crowd end up chanting his name, which is all that matters at the end of the day. He\u2019ll face Dominic Thiem next, and that could be a cracker. That\u2019s all from us today, thanks for reading along. The crowd sing Del Potro\u2019s name as he makes his way off the court. Khachanov had to deal with a partisan crowd \u2013 and a strange, slightly pantomime performance from Del Potro \u2013 and did so with minimum fuss. Del Potro clips the line with a forehand winner, then outlasts Khachanov in the next rally to go 15-30 up. A mighty first serve gets the Russian level, and when Del Potro fires a cross-court shot wide, it\u2019s a first match point. With the light fading fast, he takes it with an ace down the middle. He\u2019s into his first slam quarter-final, and in some style. There\u2019s something of Novak Djokovic about Khachanov \u2013 the lateral movement, the relentless baseline hitting, pouncing on opportunities and a killer touch when he approaches the net. Del Potro keeps him at bay on serve, but the Russian will now serve for the match... As we pass the three-hour mark, Khachanov lets 30-0 slip away with a wonky smash and missed forehand down the line. Del Potro misses the baseline by a hair, then the Russian does the same as he looks to seal the game. Deuce, and with Del Potro firing the ball back at approx 1000mph, he clips an outstanding short volley away! Delpo\u2019s resistance might finally be broken by that piece of sorcery. Khachanov one game away. Khachanov wants to get this done asap, and works poor Delpo all over the court in an 18-shot rally at deuce \u2013 then finishes with a drop shot, and implores the crowd to make some noise. The jig almost up for Del Potro, but he digs deep to keep the match alive. Khachanov leads 4-2. Khachanov keeps on track with a hold to love, sealed with a ferocious cross-courter that Delpo can only dump into the net. He leads 7-5, 6-3, 3-6, 4-1 and is two games from his first grand slam quarter-final. Woof! Khachanov is like lightning around the court, prevailing in a terrific rally and leaving Del Potro slumped face down in a flower bed like Wile E Coyote. Pure theatre from the big man tonight, but he can\u2019t get into his opponent\u2019s head. After a lengthy, somewhat scrappy tussle, he sees off two break points to keep hope alive. Del Potro confronts the second courtside buffoon to shout out mid-point during the game, giving him a brisk talking-to that ends with a firm handshake. Textbook. It\u2019s absolutely in Khachanov\u2019s best interests to get this one finished tonight. He doesn\u2019t need any more time on court, with Dominic Thiem up next if he can get through. With that in mind, he holds serve with minimum fuss, and is suddenly three games away. Khachanov breaks in the second game! A test for the Russian now \u2013 he\u2019s been motoring along at a decent level, with the match dictated by the fall and rise of Del Potro\u2019s form. Now he needs to be aggressive again, in a stadium packed with Argentinian fans. He digs out a useful hold, then gets 30-0 up on Del Potro\u2019s serve \u2013 and his opponent buckles with a double fault. A return winner seals the break, and he\u2019s back on top, 7-5, 6-3, 3-6, 2-0. Del Potro gets some eye drops from his trainer \u2013 not sure what\u2019s been bothering him, hayfever perhaps. But I\u2019m very much not a doctor. It\u2019s nearly 9pm in Paris, so probably time for one more set. The order of play is out for tomorrow \u2013 three cheers for whoever decided to put the two most eye-catching matches on at the same time. Philippe Chatrier (7) Sloane Stephens v Johanna Konta (26) (7) Kei Nishikori v Rafael Nadal (2) Suzanne Lenglen (24) Stan Wawrinka v Roger Federer (3) Marketa Vondrousova v Petra Martic (31) Khachanov makes his opponent serve it out, then rips a backhand winner down the line to level the game at 30-all. Del Potro serves up an ill-advised drop shot, and the Russian has a break point \u2013 but nets another backhand attempt. Two huge first serves get the job done for Del Potro! He\u2019s pulled a set back, and wallops himself in the end with his racket to celebrate. Can the Russian bounce straight back again? Del Potro looks a different prospect now, lashing the ball to all corners \u2013 and then double faulting to surrender a break point. What a weird performance. Delpo saves two points with ferocious forehands, and closes out with an ace. Could be a big moment \u2013 he\u2019s two sets down, but 5-2 up in the third. Famous last words, as Khachanov\u2019s first serve fails him and he slips 30-0 behind. He aims for Del Potro\u2019s suspect backhand \u2013 and he nails an unstoppable winner! Three break points, the first taken as Khachanov\u2019s shot down the line drifts wide. He\u2019s back ahead in the third set! Del Potro, who would of course be the lovable wingman that stays comfortably single throughout, holds to move 3-2 up. There\u2019s little to show he can really rattle Khachanov, who looks much the stronger from the baseline so far. Khachanov\u2019s get-up has the look of someone sent in to shake up the villa, two weeks into Love Island. He\u2019s grafting here, taken to deuce by Del Potro but dominating the next two rallies to hold. Oh, Juan Mart\u00edn. After an unexpected break that looked to have revived that match, he tumbles to 15-40 straight away. Khachanov dominates the rally, keeping the ball well away from Del Potro\u2019s forehand to break straight back! Here\u2019s Kevin Mitchell on Johanna Konta\u2019s preparations for the quarter-finals. The British No 1 takes on Sloane Stephens early doors tomorrow. Frustration boils over for Del Potro as Khachanov wins the match\u2019s longest rally with a ferocious forehand winner. Muttering away to himself, he swiftly falls 40-15 down \u2013 but rallies to deuce as his opponent takes his eye off the ball. Khachanov then overcooks a groundstroke, and it\u2019s break point! The Russian stays in the rally, and Delpo thinks he\u2019s missed a smash \u2013 but it catches the line. He\u2019s back in this, 2-0 up in the third! After a routine hold each, Khachanov serves for the second set. He hasn\u2019t given Del Potro a look in on first serve in this set. The No 10 seed quickly brings up three set points, and takes the first as his opponent goes long. It\u2019s a long way back for Del Potro now. Khachanov has never reached a grand slam quarter-final before, but he\u2019s on his way here. He\u2019s lost in the fourth round on his last two visits to Roland Garros, against Sascha Zverev and ... Andy Murray. Speaking of which: Khachanov offers up a short ball that Del Potro can\u2019t put away. Something not quite right with Delpo \u2013 he\u2019s missing chances and has seemed irritable throughout. 40-0 down here, he scraps a couple of points back but the Russian holds with a big serve out wide to lead 7-5, 4-1. Del Potro looks to get into this set but Khachanov isn\u2019t having a bar of it, powering a winner into the corner at deuce. Del Potro\u2019s big serve rescues him, and keeps the second set alive as a contest. An email! \u201cIs there a name for that crowd call and response thing that only seems to happen at Roland Garros?\u201d asks Chris Collinson. \u201cIt starts with a soloist belting out a few notes then the whole crowd shouts the French equivalent of \u201c\u00a1Ol\u00e9!\u201d in response.\u201d Je ne sais pas, Chris. But I\u2019m sure someone out there can enlighten both of us. Two stats that tell a story: Khachanov is 2/2 on break points, Del Potro 0/5. And after three games in the second set, Khachanov leads 14-2 on points, and 3-0. Del Potro was on top in that first set without making it count, and all of a sudden, the match could be slipping away. Khachanov has three break points in the second game of this second set \u2013 and takes the first! The Russian leads 7-5, 2-0. Here\u2019s the full quarter-final line-up in the women\u2019s draw. Form and seedings point to a Halep v Stephens final, but recent women\u2019s slams have been about as predictable as the Pakistan cricket team. Madison Keys (14) v Ashleigh Barty (8) (3) Simona Halep v Amanda Anisimova (7) Sloane Stephens v Johanna Konta (26) Marketa Vondrousova v Petra Martic (31) After absorbing plenty of heat on his own serve, Khachanov makes a dent on his opponent\u2019s, carving out a break and set point. He digs in to stay in the rally, and takes the set when Del Potro nets a backhand! All too easy for the up-and-coming American, who will face Simona Halep in the quarter-finals. Delpo now putting the pressure on Khachanov, some hefty winners earning him a sniff at a break. The Russian hammers down aces to deny him twice, and gets the hold. Five break points passed up by Del Potro in this set. England v Pakistan is going down to the wire at the Cricket World Cup. Sport \u2013 it just keeps giving. You can drop in on that with Rob Smyth: Del Potro seems to have regained his rhythm, firing down big first serves and coming into the net to try and keep the rallies short. He holds for five all. Incidentally, whoever wins this game, the quarter-finals look absolutely stacked. Seven of the top 10 seeds, and a previous winner in Stan Wawrinka. Del Potro\u2019s gears appear to have been ground by a mobile phone going off in the crowd, and then being censured by the umpire for swearing in Spanish. Khachanov is focusing on the job in hand, holding to go 5-4 up. On Simonne-Mathieu, the last women\u2019s quarter-final place is up for grabs. 17-year-old Amanda Anisimova is on course to take it, leading Aliona Bolsova 6-3, 2-0. Thanks Jacob, evening all. It\u2019s been a predictably gritty affair between Khachanov and Del Potro early on. Three games all, and the Argentinian is currently mithering at the umpire. My work is done. Luckily Niall McVeigh has arrived to take you through to the end of the day\u2019s play. Bye! On Suzanne-Lenglen some tennis balls could be in for some punishment until the end of play. Juan Martin del Potro, the eighth seed, is in action against the powerful young Russian Karen Khachanov. On Simonne-Mathieu, meanwhile, the USA\u2019s Amanda Anisimova is in action against Spain\u2019s Aliona Bolsova. Anisimova is one to watch. It\u2019s all over in 45 minutes. Whoosh. Halep was way too accomplished for her young Polish opponent, who will do well to learn from this free lesson from the defending champion. A zany, slightly madcap match ends with Zverev taking his third match point when Fognini batters a forehand long. It\u2019s Zverev\u2019s first win over a top-20 player this year and his first ever win over a top-20 player at a grand slam. The fifth seed will play Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals after fighting back to deal with the erratic Fognini. Fabio Fognini has just saved two match points in the tie-break against Alexander Zverev. Zverev can serve for it now. Simona Halep really isn\u2019t hanging about. She leads 6-1, 5-0 and is mercilessly crushing Iga Swiatek\u2019s hopes and dreams. Fabio Fognini holds to love with a contemptuous drop shot. He\u2019s got himself a fourth-set tie-break. Pah. I could do that. Halep only needed 26 minutes to win the first set against Swiatek and she only made three unforced errors. That\u2019s tough to break down, especially when you\u2019re an inexperienced and slightly starstruck youngster. Zverev saves a break point, roars and holds to lead 3-6, 6-2, 6-2, 5-4. Fognini will serve to stay in the match. No. Simona Halep breaks again to take the first set 6-1. Iga Swiatek, who only turned 18 on Friday, breaks back when Simona Halep was serving for the set at 5-0! The youngster has some heart. Now, can she impose her game on Halep? No hint of a smile on Suzanne-Lenglen, where Zverev and Fognini continue to fight it out in angry, tetchy, irritable fashion. Neither of them look like they\u2019re having much fun, but it is an entertaining watch, especially as Fognini has mustered some resistance in this fourth set. It\u2019s 3-3 with Zverev, who leads by two sets to one, serving. Iga Swiatek is wearing a rueful smile on her face. She\u2019s sent another forehand wide and faces the prospect of being bageled by a rampant Simona Halep, who leads 5-0 in no time at all. Swiatek looks overwhelmed by the occasion. Still, at least she can smile. Make that two breaks: Halep leads 3-0 already. It could be a blowout. Simona Halep has broken Swiatek already. What an opportunity this is for Halep to defend her title successfully. Naomi Osaka, the world No1, is out. Karolina Pliskova, the No2 seed, is out. Garbine Muguraza, the 2016 champion, is out. Serena Williams is out. The final match on Philippe-Chatrier sees the defending champion Simona Halep face the Polish teenager Iga Swiatek. It could be fascinating. Or it could be a blowout. Oh Fabio. This has been a complete capitulation from the Italian, who serves up a double-fault on set point to let Zverev cruise into a 3-6, 6-2, 6-2 lead. Zverev is a set away from a quarter-final with Novak Djokovic. A calm, composed and professional win for the 2018 finalist. That\u2019s an excellent win for Thiem after a slightly unconvincing opening week. He\u2019s through to the quarters and awaits the winner of Juan Martin del Potro and Karen Khachanov. Zverev saves a break point and holds to lead 3-6, 6-2, 5-2. Fognini is getting rather tetchy. Gael Monfils nets a limp backhand to drop his serve again. Dominic Thiem will serve for the match at 6-4, 6-4, 5-2. For all his eye-catching shotmaking Monfils is actually a pretty underwhelming player. Fognini is having some tape applied to his right leg. The word is a calf problem. Fabio Fognini has been given a warning for unsporstmanlike conduct after bashing his racquet on the clay. Now he\u2019s called for the trainer. It\u2019s all happening. Zverev looks perplexed. Over on Suzanne-Lenglen, Zverev lands the first blow in the third set. He leads 3-6, 6-2, 4-1. Dominic Thiem leaves everyone on Philippe-Chatrier with their jaws cemented to the floor with an astonishing tweener. What a shot that was. Even Monfils is chuckling and applauding. Moments later he earns a break point with a lovely chopped backhand slice down the line. Monfils saves it with a drop shot. But Thiem gets another chance and Monfils pulls a forehand wide. Thiem breaks to lead 6-4, 6-4, 2-1. An interesting tidbit. I\u2019m sure Judy is pleased... Suddenly it\u2019s Alexander Zverev dominating on Suzanne-Lenglen. He has two set points on Fognini\u2019s serve. Fognini saves the first but Zverev grabs the second with a huge forehand down the line. He levels the match after taking the second set 6-2. To think that Fognini had four break points in the fifth game of the set. Gael Monfils sends a forehand long and Dominic Thiem leads 6-4, 6-4. The Austrian shouldn\u2019t have too many problems from here, he says while completing forgetting that Thiem adores making life difficult for himself just for the fun of it. Gael Monfils knocks a backhand long to drop his serve. Thiem breaks to lead 6-4, 5-4. He\u2019ll serve for a two-set lead. After dealing with all that pressure, now it\u2019s Zverev\u2019s turn to press at Fognini\u2019s eccentricities. He earns two break break points. Fognini saves the first with a smash, but Zverev converts the second to lead 4-2 in the second set. Fognini lets Zverev of the hook on break point, spanking a forehand long. Bad miss. Not much is working for Zverev, though, and he gives the Italian another chance after netting a backhand. Zverev saves it with an ace. Then he double-faults. Then he forces deuce with a stunning forehand down the line. It\u2019s deuce for a while. Zverev sums up where he is by following a double-fault with an ace to save another break point. Somehow he holds to lead 3-2 in the second set. Thiem sprays a lovely backhand down the line to hold for 3-3 in the second set. This is much more even now, though. Monfils is playing some sprightly tennis. Dominic Thiem hasn\u2019t been on the end of any gifts from Gael Monfils in the second set on Philippe-Chatrier. Monfils is more dialled in now. He\u2019s serving well and finding the mark with some skidding groundstrokes. Thiem leads 6-4, 1-2 and is about to serve. Alexander Zverev is not in a good place mentally at the moment. He\u2019s bellowing in Russian after more errors at the start of the second set. He really needs to get his act together. He\u2019s in danger of handing the match to Fognini. Alexander Zverev batters another forehand long and bellows at his box. He\u2019s livid. But Fabio Fognini\u2019s delighted. The 9th seed is a set to the good against the young German on Suzanne-Lenglen. That was a very impressive set from Fogini, who took it 6-3. As for events on Philippe-Chatrier, Dominic Thiem has quelled the late fightback from Gael Monfils and taken the first set 6-4. The lesson there is not to waste the first 10 minutes of a match. Start as you mean to go on. Under pressure, Zverev goes for way too much on a second serve and hands Fognini a break point at 3-4 in the first set. Then he balloons a forehand to give the Italian a break. The young German\u2019s so furious he decides to punish himself by stuffing his gold necklace in his mouth and having a good old chew on the metal. Yum! Having held to lead 4-3 on Suzanne-Lenglen, Fabio Fognini can be seen glaring at the umpire as he walks back to his chair. He\u2019s a fiery character. It\u2019s not clear why he\u2019s annoyed. Monfils has woken up! Serving for the set, Thiem finds himself down 0-30. He finds the line with a few backhands, but it\u2019s Monfils who comes up with the decisive shot, a brilliant low backhand for three break points. He\u2019s in this now, the Frenchman, and he quickly breaks to love to trail 3-5 on Chatrier. Gael Monfils is having a shocker. Serving to stay in the opening set, one of his forehands goes a good 10 yards past the baseline. He\u2019s making so many errors. Dominic Thiem is barely having to do anything. But Monfils does manage to hold. Thiem will serve for the set at 5-2. Alexander Zverev waits for Fabio Fognini\u2019s level to dip, which always seemed a likely development, and breaks to love. Zverev is back in the first set and will serve at 2-3. Alexander Zverev is on the board against Fabio Fognini. Gael Monfils is on the board against Dominic Thiem. Monfils loses his serve again. He\u2019s 3-0 down to Thiem and playing atrociously. If only he could rewind the last 10 minutes and start again. Ah, and here\u2019s Jacob. I\u2019ll hand back over to him. Bye. Fognini held his serve after a testing first game against Zverev. I was warned by Jacob that this match may go five sets. The closeness of that first game suggests he may be right. One man who exuded calm earlier was Novak Djokovic. Here\u2019s the report of his straight-sets win over Jan-Lennard Struff. Ga\u00ebl Monfils gets off to a shocker, losing his serve to love immediately, with two double faults thrown in for good measure. He needs to calm down a little, he looks incredibly jumpy. Tok! Tok! Tok! The Parisian skies have brightened up considerably and the players are out on court warming up. Just a reminder, we have Thiem v Monfils on Philippe-Chatrier and Fognini v Zverev on Suzanne-Lenglen in the men\u2019s last 16. It looks like the rain is petering out at Roland Garros and the forecast for the afternoon is good so when play does get under way it shouldn\u2019t be interrupted. Another headline match this afternoon that has been delayed by the Parisian drizzle is fourth seed Dominic Thiem v Ga\u00ebl Monfils, the 16th seed and French fans\u2019 favourite. Should be fun on Philippe-Chatrier once the clouds clear. Hello, it\u2019s Gregg here. I\u2019ll be keeping you updated while Jacob is fuelling up for the potential five-setters this afternoon. One of those matches is ninth seed Fabio Fognini v fifth seed Alexander Zverev on Court Suzanne-Lenglen. There\u2019s no sign of the players on court yet, though, because \u2026 it\u2019s raining. Might not be much to update you on then. Hmmm. I\u2019ll keep you posted. I\u2019m heading for lunch. Gregg Bakowski will step in. Move along, nothing to see here. The world No1 was in exceptional form. Can anyone stop him reaching the final? Serving for the match, Nishikori begins by knocking a forehand wide for 0-15. He wins the next two points, though, a backhand lob taking him to 30-15. Soon he has his third match point. He misses a first serve. But Paire nets a forehand off a second serve and Nishikori, who must be exhausted, is through to face Rafael Nadal! Who\u2019s just who you\u2019d want to play after a long, gruelling five-setter. Benoit Paire saves a break point magnificently. He has a point to kill the game. Then he double-faults. So many self-inflicted blows. Then comes a dismal forehand slice that drifts past the baseline, giving Nishikori a break point. Nishikori goes on the attack and he makes life awkward for Paire with a few looping shots. Off balance, the Frenchman nets a backhand. Nishikori will serve for the match at 6-5! Benoit Paire is down in the dumps after that game. Kei Nishikori, hitting his spots now, holds to 30 for 5-5. \u201cRafa Nadal couldn\u2019t have asked for a better birthday gift than this Nishikori - Paire match,\u201d Aditi Modi says. \u201cRegardless of the outcome of this match, its length, and the fact that it\u2019ll get over today, can only bode well for the defending champion.\u201d Defiant to the last, Kei Nishikori makes it 0-15 with a glorious passing shot. At 15-all Benoit Paire double-faults. Uh oh. Oh dear. Then he nets a backhand volley to give Nishikori two break points. To be fair there wasn\u2019t much he could do with an excellent backhand from Nishikori. He saves the first with a big serve for 30-40 - but Nishikori takes the second with a stonking forehand return to break back! Paire served for the match and didn\u2019t come close to getting over the line. What a match this is turning out to be. Serving at 3-4, Kei Nishikori finds himself down a break point. He comes up with a huge, deep, brave forehand to save it. Benoit Paire is making chances. Soon he has another - and this time he belts a backhand return down the line! He\u2019ll serve for the match at 5-3. The French crowd love it. \u201cAllez Benoit!\u201d they cry. In less dramatic news, Novak Djokovic has broken already in the third set on Philippe-Chatrier. He leads 6-3, 6-2, 2-0. But Benoit Paire is so inconsistent. He\u2019s up 40-15 on his own serve. Before long he\u2019s looking to the heavens after being broken. Nishikori, who has plenty of weapons of his own, is back in this increasingly dramatic fifth set! Kei Nishikori comes through a tough deuce game to hold. But Benoit Paire, who\u2019s hitting his groundstrokes so beautifully, leads 4-2. Novak Djokovic has raced into a two-set lead. It\u2019s only taken an hour. He leads Jan-Lennard Struff 6-3, 6-2. Benoit Paire is on his way to beating Kei Nishikori. He\u2019s a break up in the fifth set. Novak Djokovic is a set and a break to the good against Jan-Lennard Struff, who has a sort of faraway look on his face at the moment. The German\u2019s wondering what on earth he can do to break down the Djokovic wall. Indeed he\u2019s soon in danger of going down two breaks, at which point he nets a forehand. Djokovic leads 6-3, 3-0. Kei Nishikori only does five-setters. Benoit Paire nails a backhand down the line on set point and despite holding two match points in the tie-break - both on his own serve, for crying out loud - Nishikori is going the distance again. Clearly he doesn\u2019t like rest. Paire, having won the tie-break 10-8, will fancy himself now. Benoit Paire wastes a set point. Kei Nishikori wastes a second match point, a backhand flashing wide. On they go. 8-8. Here\u2019s a report on Ashleigh Barty\u2019s win over Sofia Kenin. Benoit Paire saves a match point in magnificent style, giving a lame second serve from Kei Nishikori the treatment. It\u2019s 6-6 in the tie-break. Elsewhere Novak Djokovic has the first set in the bag against Struff. All of a sudden Novak Djokovic starts to get the missiles from Jan-Lennard Struff back with interest. You know what that means. Djokovic earns two break points and the punishing relentlessness of his accurate, piercing groundstrokes is too much for Struff to handle. The German is powerless when he lifts the ball into the air for Djokovic to smash and break for 5-3. Kei Nishikori gobbles up a poor drop shot from Benoit Paire to grab an early advantage in the tie-break. He leads 4-2. Three points from victory. If a quarter-final against Rafa Nadal counts as a victory. Benoit Paire holds. Tie-break. It\u2019s been a good start on Philippe-Chatrier. Jan-Lennard Struff is really hitting through the ball at the moment, which is allowing him to stay with Novak Djokovic. They\u2019re still on serve. Back on Suzanne-Lenglen, Kei Nishikori has held to lead 6-2, 6-7, 6-2, 6-5, meaning Benoit Paire needs to hold to stay in the match. Kei Nishikori is heeding my advice. He\u2019s broken back against the always unpredictable Benoit Paire in the fourth set. Over on Suzanne-Lenglen, Kei Nishikori is already a break down in the fourth set against Benoit Paire. He just loves five-setters. But it\u2019s letting this one go the distance probably isn\u2019t the best approach given the winner plays Rafa Nadal. The next match on Philippe-Chatrier: Novak Djokovic and Jan-Lennard Struff, a big-hitting German who had to dig deep to beat Borna Coric in the third round. Struff had to go to 11-9 in the fifth set to beat Coric. Perfect preparation for taking on the world No1. That\u2019s some way to handle a deciding set. Barty wobbled midway through this speedy match, but she is deservedly through to the last eight for the first time. She\u2019ll play Madison Keys next. Sofia Kenin didn\u2019t quite have the consistency or energy to follow up her win over Serena Williams, but she can be proud of her efforts over the past week. Next on Suzanne-Lenglen, a match held over from last night is about to resume. Kei Nishikori, seeded seventh, was leading by two sets to one against Benoit Paire when bad light stopped play. It would be very Nishikori to let this trundle into a third set. Ashleigh Barty is in complete control on Philippe-Chatrier now. Her serve has clicked and she bangs down an ace to lead 6-3, 3-6, 5-0. Poor Sofia Kenin was so full of hope at the start of the final set, but she has been blown away here. The American has a big grin on her face.
