But it takes a player of Paul Lewis's standing to programme them all in one recital, with the more exalted Op 81a \"Les Adieux\" sonata to round things off. In order not to unbalance his Wigmore recital by coupling the longest and most portentous of the 1798 trio with Les Adieux, Lewis sensibly opened with the second of the Op 10 group. This is one of the most playful works Beethoven wrote, and Lewis was scintillatingly alive to all its contrasts, pauses and jokes. The most memorable playing of the evening came next, in the longest of the four works. Lewis caught all the alternating gruffness and rhapsody of the elemental opening presto of the four-movement Op 10 No 3 Sonata. He was even more impressive in the emotional largo that follows, never allowing the piece to lose its momentum. The beautifully judged minuet provided a tender contrast and the closing rondo, which sounded here as though it looked forward to the Waldstein Sonata, was electrifying in its clarity. Something seemed to get lost after the interval. Lewis opted for the big approach to the C minor Sonata Op 10 No 1. This worked well for the dramas of the first movement, but felt too emphatic for the dreamy and almost improvisatory adagio. Les Adieux, a highly personal sonata that combines formidable technical difficulty with great harmonic boldness, and pictorial effects with introspection, did not quite gel either. On the evidence of the marvellous first half of this concert, Lewis can clearly get more from this strange but heartwarming work than he did this time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
