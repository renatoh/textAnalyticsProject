After sustaining an ankle injury at the start of this season, the \u00a39m keeper has lost his place to Hungary's Marton Fulop and is suitably frustrated. \"It's not nice,\" said Gordon yesterday. \"I don't see myself as being behind anyone. I've been very disappointed by the situation.\" Signed by Roy Keane from Hearts in the summer of 2007, Gordon appears to be a victim of Sbragia's determination that Sunderland should be a meritocracy. \"I know Craig is unhappy and disappointed and I would expect him to be disappointed,\" said Keane's successor. \"But Marton has been super and it wouldn't be right for me to just drop Marton. I want competition in the squad. There will come a time when we have to make a decision but, at the moment, Marton is playing well.\" George Burley, Scotland's manager, has voiced his dismay at Gordon's exclusion but Sbragia remains unrepentant. \"I would hope this would make Craig mentally strong, it's a learning time for him,\" he said. \"He has probably never been in this situation. He has probably always been ever-present and he has probably always come back in from injury and got the No1 jersey. It's a testing time mentally for Craig now but, credit to him, he's working hard and he's putting more pressure on Marton.\" While, realistically, it will be well nigh impossible to keep two international goalkeepers happy on Wearside long-term, Sunderland's manager does not envisage selling Gordon this summer. \"I certainly wouldn't want to lose Craig,\" insisted Sbragia, who accepted Gordon's request to be allowed to turn out for the reserves and then watched him impress on Tuesday night in a home win against Bolton played at Eppleton Colliery Welfare. Indeed he has not ruled out the possibility of taking the radical step of rotating his keepers next season. \"It would be nice to play one one week and the other the next,\" he said. \"I've done it with outfield players, so there's no reason why I couldn't do it with goalkeepers.\" Gordon has been fit since January and is increasingly concerned about his international prospects, particularly with a vital World Cup qualifier against Holland looming. \"The Scotland situation is difficult,\" he admitted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
