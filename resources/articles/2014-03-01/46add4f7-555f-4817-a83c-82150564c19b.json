President Putin has insisted on his right to defend ethnic Russians in Ukraine. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UN has said there are now 15,000 new Russian troops in Crimea. Here is the full White House statement. Readout of President Obama\u2019s Call with President Putin President Obama spoke for 90 minutes this afternoon with President Putin of Russia about the situation in Ukraine. President Obama expressed his deep concern over Russia\u2019s clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity, which is a breach of international law, including Russia\u2019s obligations under the UN Charter, and of its 1997 military basing agreement with Ukraine, and which is inconsistent with the 1994 Budapest Memorandum and the Helsinki Final Act. The United States condemns Russia\u2019s military intervention into Ukrainian territory. The United States calls on Russia to de-escalate tensions by withdrawing its forces back to bases in Crimea and to refrain from any interference elsewhere in Ukraine. We have consistently said that we recognize Russia\u2019s deep historic and cultural ties to Ukraine and the need to protect the rights of ethnic Russian and minority populations within Ukraine. The Ukrainian government has made clear its commitment to protect the rights of all Ukrainians and to abide by Ukraine\u2019s international commitments, and we will continue to urge them to do so. President Obama told President Putin that, if Russia has concerns about the treatment of ethnic Russian and minority populations in Ukraine, the appropriate way to address them is peacefully through direct engagement with the government of Ukraine and through the dispatch of international observers under the auspices of the United Nations Security Council or the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). As a member of both organizations, Russia would be able to participate. President Obama urged an immediate effort to initiate a dialogue between Russia and the Ukrainian government, with international facilitation, as appropriate. The United States is prepared to participate. President Obama made clear that Russia\u2019s continued violation of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity would negatively impact Russia\u2019s standing in the international community. In the coming hours and days, the United States will urgently consult with allies and partners in the UN Security Council, the North Atlantic Council, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and with the signatories of the Budapest Memorandum. The United States will suspend upcoming participation in preparatory meetings for the G-8. Going forward, Russia\u2019s continued violation of international law will lead to greater political and economic isolation. The people of Ukraine have the right to determine their own future. President Obama has directed his Administration to continue working urgently with international partners to provide support for the Ukrainian government, including urgent technical and financial assistance. Going forward, we will continue consulting closely with allies and partners, the Ukrainian government and the International Monetary Fund, to provide the new government with significant assistance to secure financial stability, to support needed reforms, to allow Ukraine to conduct successful elections, and to support Ukraine as it pursues a democratic future. Dan Roberts, the Guardian Washington correspondent, has highlighted the key part of the White House\u2019s summary of Obama\u2019s call with Putin. President Obama made clear that Russia\u2019s continued violation of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity would negatively impact Russia\u2019s standing in the international community. In the coming hours and days, the United States will urgently consult with allies and partners in the UN Security Council. Here is the full statement from Putin\u2019s office on his call with Obama. In response to the concern shown by Obama about the plans for the possible use of Russia\u2019s armed forces on the territory of Ukraine, Putin drew attention to the provocative, criminal actions by ultra-nationalists, in essence encouraged by the current authorities in Kiev,\u201d the statement said. The Russian President underlined that there are real threats to the life and health of Russian citizens and compatriots on Ukrainian territory. Vladimir Putin stressed that if violence spread further in the eastern regions of Ukraine and in Crimea, Russia reserves the right to protect its interests and those of Russian speakers living there. Reuters have filed a report from Crimea on the reactions of residents to the unfolding crisis. When a convoy of Russian military vehicles unloaded dozens of armed troops into this sleepy Crimean port town on Saturday, residents thronged around them honking car horns, snapping pictures and waving Russian flags. Ludmila Marchenko,66, a retired teacher, simply burst into applause when asked about the masked soldiers with automatic rifles standing guard nearby. \u201cAt first we were in shock, now we see it as a liberation,\u201d the 66-year-old told Reuters. Those residents who felt foreboding as they watched the armoured vehicles roll mostly hung back in the crowd. This is a mess. This is an invasion. I think this is an act of aggression by Russia,\u201d said Dmitry Bessonov, 55, a retired miner from Donetsk. Such voices may be in the minority. \u201cThey made a big mistake when they stood on Maidan and said they wanted to ban the Russian language ... We don\u2019t want to be second-class citizens,\u201d said Marchenko\u2019s brother Vitaly, a civilian sailor. \u201cI am not against a united Ukraine ... Yes, our president was not great. Yes, there was corruption and theft, but we don\u2019t want to live under these conditions. We are just sick of these speeches by fascists and neo-fascists.\u201d The sight of Russian boots on the ground here on the outskirts of Sevastopol - home to the Black Sea Fleet - is nothing unusual to residents, who quickly adapted to the presence of more than 100 armed men parked along the main strip of the bay that is popular with tourists. The masked soldiers stood congenially shoulder -to-shoulder with residents who posed for photographs. They happily accepted cigarettes from the crowd. In a bizarre carnival-like scene, Russian Orthodox priests chanted prayers, while a wedding party drove by loudly honking their car horns. \u201cIt is a great joy for is,\u201d said Vladimir Tikhonov, 53, an electrician. \u201cI want this to be Russian land and it will be.\u201d Valentina Magomedova, an accountant whose curiosity drew her to the scene, said people regretted a decision by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, himself a Ukrainian, to transfer the Crimea from Russia to Soviet Ukraine in 1954. \u201cThe new authorities (in Kiev) are not legitimate. We trust Putin, we love Russia,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were part of Russia and we are sorry still that Khrushchev gave us away.\u201d While most residents had no love for Kiev\u2019s new leaders, some were worried by the dangers of the situation and wary of Russia\u2019s designs. Confronting the mute soldiers, one man vented his frustration, \u201cWhat are you doing here? Get lost.\u201d \u201cI have a business, tourist season is beginning, I can\u2019t have a war,\u201d he said under his breath, shaking his head and turning his back on the 10 trucks and five armoured vehicles. A nearby restaurant decided to shut its doors early and keep them shut for the next few days. \u201cThat\u2019s me losing my salary, if this keeps up,\u201d said Natalia Fomichova, 35, a lively blonde waitress at the seaside restaurant, overlooking opulent private motor boats parked in Balaclava bay. \u201cNo one asked us. We are like puppets for them ... We have one Tsar and god - Putin,\u201d she said. Samantha Power, the US ambassador to the UN has called for the immediate deployment of international observers to Crimea. Presidents Putin and Obama have had a telephone conversation. Putin said that he reserved the right to defend Russian interests in Crimea and east Ukraine. Obama said he was concerned about any plans for Russian intervention in Ukraine. Putin replied that he was concerned about \u201cprovocative criminal\u201d actions by far rightists sanctioned by the Ukrainian authorities. Reuters Ukraine has asked Nato to look at all ways to protect its territorial integrity. The foreign minister, Sergei Deshchiritsya, said he had held talks with officials from the US and the European Union and then asked Nato for help after what Ukraine\u2019s prime minister described as Russian aggression. A request had been made to Nato to \u201clook at using all possibilities for protecting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, the Ukrainian people and nuclear facilities on Ukrainian territory,\u201d he said. Reuters This is the clearest graph I could find that shows the reliance of European countries on Russian gas. It is probably out of date. UK\u2019s production of natural gas has fallen and Russia now supplies one-third of European gas, compared to one-half about ten years ago. Also Qatar has become a major exporter of gas to Europe. Reuters report that Barack Obama\u2019s national security team met on Saturday for an update on the situation in Ukraine and to discuss potential policy options. The meeting came as Ukraine asked the US and other key members of the UN security council to help safeguard its territorial integrity after Russia announced plans to send armed forces into Crimea. While in New York... Two Russian warships have been spotted near Sevastopol, according to Reuters. Dimitri Trenin of the Carnegie Moscow Centre believe that potential for war is great and makes these recommendations to avoid it. A public statement by Putin supporting Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and opposing any moves by Crimea to secede. A public commitment by Turchinov and the new provisional Ukrainian government to resolve all disputes in Ukraine peacefully. Moscow\u2019s recognition of the new provisional government in Ukraine after it is formed and confirmed by the parliament, the return of the Russian ambassador to Ukraine, and the resumption of official dialogue between Moscow and Kyiv. Suspension of the implementation of the Ukrainian parliament\u2019s decision to repeal the language law, which has fomented greater tensions in the country than it has helped fight separatism. Informal suspension by the Ukrainian authorities of the threat to prosecute citizens for separatism (Citizens should, of course, be held accountable for their actions, but it is doubtful that the investigative organs are able to act impartially and carefully during a period of revolutionary turmoil.). A resolution by the Ukrainian parliament confirming the nonaligned status of Ukraine, which was enshrined in law in 2010. A reciprocal moratorium by Moscow on provocative steps like the possible distribution of Russian passports in Crimea or military movements by Black Sea Fleet units outside their base. Re-establishment of a human rights monitoring mission in Crimea led by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that would pick up where a previous effort that ended in 1999 left off. NATO will now meet at the behest of Latvia and Lithuania. Latvia\u2019s population is almost 30% Russian, rising to more than 40 per cent in the capital Riga. Lithuania\u2019s Russian minority is around 6%. Yulia Tymoshenko, the former prime minister who was freed one week ago, has called for Ukrainians to remain calm in the face of provocation and avoid falling into the trap that Georgia did in 2008. She said that the Ukraine must engage with the UN and EU. Russia has just committed another act of intimidation against Ukraine. Thus Russia wants to kill the independence of Ukraine, to get us to surrender. We are a peaceful people , we are a peaceful country but if we accept the ultimatum now from Russia - we lose our country. I propose to act, but to keep calm and not fully react against Russian aggression and not to act according to their plans, exacerbating the situation. They want a war scenario like Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia. Ukraine must now become a gathering place for the entire democratic world. We must make sure that when Russia will meet in Ukraine to shoot , then she should know that at this moment it will shoot the entire democratic world , which at that time will be in Ukraine. I ask all Ukrainians to unite in this difficult time . Our main weapon is complete peace of mind . We will all work at the diplomatic level and win. Unian Ukraine\u2019s acting president has said that Russia has no justification for its aggression and has ordered the army to be put on \u201ccombat alert\u201d. The prime minister of Ukraine has said that Russian forces must return to their bases in Crimea and any further military intervention by Moscow will result in war. Here\u2019s footage of nasty scenes in Kharkiv where pro-Russian supporters beat up some young men who disagreed with them and made them kneel before them. The diplomatic interventions are coming fast. The first two snaps from Reuters are from Nato\u2019s secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, and the last three are from Catherine Ashton, the EU\u2019s foreign policy representative. URGENT NEED FOR DE-ESCALATION IN UKRAINE\u2019S CRIMEA; NATO ALLIES CONTINUE TO COORDINATE CLOSELY - RASMUSSEN RUSSIA MUST RESPECT UKRAINE\u2019S SOVEREIGNTY, INCLUDING WITH REGARD TO MOVEMENT OF RUSSIAN FORCES IN UKRAINE EU\u2019S ASHTON SAYS DECISION TO USE RUSSIAN ARMED FORCES IN UKRAINE IS UNWARRANTED ESCALATION OF TENSIONS EU\u2019S ASHTON CALLS ON RUSSIA NOT TO DISPATCH TROOPS BUT TO PROMOTE ITS VIEWS THROUGH PEACEFUL MEANS EU\u2019S ASHTON SAYS UNITY, SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF UKRAINE MUST BE RESPECTED BY ALL SIDES Russia Today has accused a Ukrainian nationalist leader of calling on a Chechen leader to make common cause against Russia. The evidence is a screen grab of an unconvincing Russian social media page. A leader of the Ukrainian radical group Pravy Sektor (Right Sector), Dmitry Yarosh, has called on Russia\u2019s most wanted terrorist Doku Umarov to act against Russia in an address posted on Right Sector\u2019s page in VKontakte social network. The statement points out that \u201cmany Ukrainians with arms in the hands\u201d supported Chechen militants in their fight against Russians and \u201cit is time to support Ukraine now.\u201d The message, signed \u201cleader of Right Sector Dmitry Yarosh\u201d then calls on Umarov \u201cto activate his fight\u201d and \u201ctake a unique chance to win\u201d over Russia. And again from the right. Sarah Palin feels vindicated as she posts on Facebook. Yes, I could see this one from Alaska. I\u2019m usually not one to Told-Ya-So, but I did, despite my accurate prediction being derided as \u201can extremely far-fetched scenario\u201d by the \u201chigh-brow\u201d Foreign Policy magazine. Here\u2019s what this \u201cstupid\u201d \u201cinsipid woman\u201d predicted back in 2008: \u201cAfter the Russian Army invaded the nation of Georgia, Senator Obama\u2019s reaction was one of indecision and moral equivalence, the kind of response that would only encourage Russia\u2019s Putin to invade Ukraine next.\u201d The US defence secretary, Chuck Hagel, spoke on Saturday with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, a US official told Reuters. Asked about rumours that some US military units had been on alert over turmoil in the Crimean peninsula, the official said the US focus was on diplomatic options. There are many mentions of the Charge of the Light Brigade which took place in 1854 during the Crimean War. Less well remembered is the Thin Red Line, when the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders dispersed a Russian cavalry charge at Balaclava. You can read about both in George McDonald Fraser\u2019s Flashman at the Charge or the latter here. Here\u2019s an interesting graphic on the statistics of Ukraine and Russia. According to the BBC, Refat Chubarov, the head of the Crimean Tatar Majlis (assembly) says he is calling on Tatars to stay at home and not form resistance units. \u201cLiterally hours remain until catastrophe,\u201d he said to the Gazprom-owned Russian radio station Ekho Moskvy. Tatars make up about 12 percent of Crimea\u2019s population and have sided with the anti-Yanukovych protesters - now government - in Kiev. After a day of escalating rhetoric and activity, a Kremlin spokesman says that Russia hopes there will be no further escalation and that Putin has not yet decided if he will send troops into Ukraine, Reuters reports. William Hague, the foreign secretary, has said that Russian action in Ukraine is grave threat to sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine. He has also summoned the Russian ambassador to express his grave concerns. This a great photograph from Kharkiv but the crowds in the square below do not look immense for a city of 1.5 million. One of the nationalist groups that were part of the demonstrations against former president Viktor Yanukovych has called on its members to mobilise and arm themselves. According to Ukrainian Pravda, Sector Right called on all its units to mobilise. This is their statement: Being aware of all the dangers that are looming over the Ukrainian state, the headquarters of the Right Sector order all its units to mobilise and arm, and depending on the specific situation to coordinate with the armed forces. We remind all citizens of Ukraine regardless of nationality (including Russians ) that our struggle is anti-imperial , not Russophobe. Russian empire will be destroyed. Urge Resistance Movement Caucasus and all liberation movements in Russia to step up their activities. The UN security council will hold an urgent meeting on the crisis in Ukraine on Saturday after Russia announced plans to send armed forces into the autonomous Crimea region of the former Soviet republic. A diplomat from Luxembourg, president of the 15-nation council this month, said the meeting would take place at 2pm EST (7pm GMT) and was being convened at the request of Britain. Reuters Putin\u2019s desire to re-build the Soviet Union as a colonial power were seen as rhetoric until now, argues his biographer Masha Gessen. Now they realise he is serious and this will mean Russian aggression abroad and repression at home. Read her Observer piece here. Vitali Klitschko called on Saturday for a \u201cgeneral mobilisation\u201d following the Russian parliament\u2019s decision to approve deploying troops in Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region. \u201cKlitschko calls for a declaration on a general mobilisation,\u201d his party Udar (Punch) said in a statement. Klitschko plans to run for election for president on 25 May. Further to the image of a bloodied protester in Kharkiv. We reported earlier that the Ukrainian navy was ordered out to sea. The federal council has now asked Putin to withdraw the Russian ambassador to the United States while other government figures use calmer rhetoric, stating the proposal to use Russian troops may not be used immediately. Russia Today reports that 97 people have been injured in clashes between anti- and pro-Maidan demonstrators in Kharkov, citing Itar-Tass news agency. The federation council has now approved Putin\u2019s request to use armed force in Ukraine. CNN are showing images of Russian tanks on the move in Crimea. Shaun Walker is listening to the debate Reuters have reported that Ukraine\u2019s acting president has called an emergency meeting of security chiefs on Saturday. Oleksander Turchinov summoned his Security Council after Russian President Vladimir Putin sought parliamentary approval to deploy Russian forces in the Ukrainian region of Crimea. According to Russia Today, the international affairs committee of the upper house, the federation council has recommended senators approve deploying Russian troops to Ukraine. The Russian upper house has not yet voted on Putin\u2019s proposal although all the speeches made so far are supportive. The upper house of the Russian parliament unanimously approved President Putin\u2019s request to use armed forces in defence of Russians and Russian interests, anywhere in the territory of Ukraine. Putin ask for right to use armed forces in Ukraine. Ukrainians accuse Russia of refusing dialogue. European foreign ministers urge Russia to respect sovereignty of Ukraine and help reduce tension. Pro-Russian demonstrations take place in Kharkiv, Donetsk, Odessa and other towns. Reports of Russian troops attempting to take Ukrainian bases in Crimea. Russian President Vladimir Putin has asked the upper house of parliament to approve sending armed forces to Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region, the Kremlin said in a statement on Saturday. \u201cIn connection with the extraordinary situation in Ukraine, the threat to the lives of citizens of the Russian Federation, our compatriots, and the personnel of the armed forces of the Russian Federation on Ukrainian territory (in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea) ... I submit a proposal on using the armed forces of the Russian Federation on the territory of Ukraine until the normalisation of the socio-political situation in the that country,\u201d the statement said. Reuters Pictures suggest Russian army moving into Crimean city of Balaclava where there have been reports of Russian troops trying to take a naval base. According to Interfax, there was also a pro-Russian demonstration in Odessa with between 5,000 to 20,000 participants, some armed with clubs. Ukraine has accused Russia of refusing to hold talks with Ukraine. Ukraine had asked for consultations with Moscow after accusing it of deploying its military in the Crimea region, according to Reuters. \u201cWe are very worried about today\u2019s information that Russia has refused to take part,\u201d said foreign minister Andrij Deshchitsya. Ukrainian Pravda report that Ukrainian football clubs could be banned from international competitions after the Ukrainian Football Union was taken over by a militia, believed to be connected to Dynamo Kiev. Political organisations are banned from interfering with the affairs of football according to Fifa and Uefa regulations. Unian news agency report dozens of injuries in Kharkiv after a car drove into \u201cEuromaidan\u201d demonstrators who were opposing pro-Russian demonstrators outside the parliament. It\u2019s difficult to gauge what has happened in Kharhiv and Donestsk. Some commentators have posted scenes of an empty square in Donetsk, suggesting the demonstrators were only paid for short time. Reuters and other agencies reporting UKRAINE\u2019S ACTING PRESIDENT SIGNS DECREE RULING THAT APPOINTMENT OF PRO-RUSSIA PREMIER IN CRIMEA IS ILLEGAL Crimean police have rejected the claim made by the Russian foreign ministry in Russia Today that troops sent by Kiev tried to capture the interior ministry in Semferopol. According to Unian news agency, there was no shooting or clashes of any kind nor any attempt to blockade the building. Reuters report that Ukraine is unlikely to receive financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund before April according to Ukrainian Finance Minister Oleksander Shlapak. Ukraine, which faces a further $6 billion in foreign debt payments this year, has asked the IMF for financial assistance of at least $15 billion. An IMF team is expected in Kiev next week. According to various Russian and Ukrainian reports, the crisis is spreading from Crimea to other parts of the Ukraine. There are reports that pro-Russian demonstrators in Donestsk and Kharkiv have attempted to take parliament buildings. Kiev-based Unian report some more worrying developments. The State Border Guard Service of Ukraine said that about 300 soldiers are trying to capture a Sevastopol naval bases. Ukrainian ships have ordered to sea. It is not clear if weapons are being fired or if there are any injuries. Following the statement of Fabius, the German and British foreign ministers have weighed in. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier warned on Saturday that developments in Ukraine over the past few hours were dangerous and urged Russia to explain its intentions regarding its troops in the Crimea region. \u201cThe situation in Crimea in particular has become considerably more acute. Whoever pours more oil onto the flames now, with words or actions, is consciously aiming for further escalation of the situation. Everything Russia does in Crimea must be in keeping with the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and treaties on Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet. We are holding the Russian government to its public statements on this. And this entails also that Russia provides without delay complete transparency over the movements of its troops in Crimea, as well as its goals and intentions behind these.\u201d William Hague, the British foreign secretary, has spoken to Sergei Lavrov, his Russian counterpart and urged Russia to respect Ukrainian sovereignty and help de-escalate the situation. Some images from Ukraine today. Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, has said it is concerned about the reports of troop movements and urged all sides in Crimea to refrain from acts that could increase tension. In spite of the claims of normality, Kiev\u2019s Unian agency report that armed have taken over the council of trade unions in Simferopol which is close to the government building. Pravda reports that the speaker of the supreme council of Crimea Vladimir Konstantinov has said that the situation in Crimea will be normalised and guards will leave the boundaries of the parliament. Konstantinov said that barricades will be dismantled and he intended to address issues such as the economy, wages and pensions. In Moscow, Reuters reports that the Duma, has asked President Vladimir Putin to take measures to stabilise the situation in Ukraine\u2019s Crimea. Sergei Naryshkin, the speaker of the Duma, said \u201cThe Duma Council adopted an appeal to the president of Russia, in which parliamentarians are calling on the president to take measures to stabilise the situation in Crimea and use all available means to protect the people of Crimea from tyranny and violence.\u201d I have just spoken to Harriet Salem, our correspondent in Simferopol in Crimea, who is currently in a local McDonalds availing herself of the free wi-fi. I have just travelled from Sevastopol to Simferopol. There was little sign of tension. Mostly people are just going about their business. There were blockades outside of Sevastopol manned by armed civilians with motorbikes parked nearby but there was no problem passing through. Here\u2019s more from Reuters on Gazprom. Ukraine may lose a discount to the gas price it now pays to Russia\u2019s state gas company Gazprom due to Kiev\u2019s outstanding gas debt, Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov told Reuters on Saturday. In December, Russia agreed to reduce gas prices for Kiev by about a third, to $268.50 per 1,000 cubic metres from around $400 which Ukraine had paid since 2009, after ousted President Viktor Yanukovich spurned an EU trade deal in favour of closer ties to Moscow. Kupriyanov said Ukraine\u2019s outstanding gas debt stood at $1.55 billion for 2013 and gas deliveries so far this year. \u201cIt seems that with such gas payments and fulfilment of its obligations Ukraine may not keep its current gas discount. The gas discount agreement assumed full and timely payment,\u201d he said. The deal allowed for the price to be revised quarterly between the 5th and 10th day of the first month every quarter. AFP report that the referendum in Crimea has been brought forward to March 30 by the regional parliament. The report continues that to say that 15 soldiers arrived at the military base and took over the checkpoint. They are now trying to get access to the command post. This is what Ukrainian news agency Unian are reporting: In Yalta Russian military is trying to capture the anti-missile part of the APU - source There are now reports from Interfax that Russian forces are trying to take a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile base in Crimea. A spokesman for Gazprom has said that Ukraine could lose its discount for gas supplies because of its outstanding debts, according to Reuters. Oil and gas diplomacy could be a potent weapon for both buyers and sellers. The Telegraph\u2019s Roland Oliphant has spoken to the mystery troops who say they are members of the Russian 810 brigade, based in Sevastopol. Reuters snapping a report from Interfax which confirms Russian troops are guarding Crimean buildings. PRO-RUSSIA PREMIER OF UKRAINE\u2019S CRIMEA REGION SAYS RUSSIAN BLACK SEA FLEET SERVICEMEN ARE GUARDING SOME IMPORTANT BUILDINGS IN CRIMEA - INTERFAX This is an interesting article in the Washington Post about how Russia\u2018s ability to use natural gas supplies to Ukraine as a weapon, as it has done in the past, has been reduced by other developments. But the author does not mention that Russian\u2019s gas reserves are also its vulnerability. More than 60 per cent of Russian government revenues come from oil and gas. If the the EU stopped using Russian gas, it could cause immense problems for Russia. It would also cause big problems in Europe, but these would be of a different magnitude heading into spring as opposed to heading into winter. Here are the facts that Russia Today thinks are relevant about the Crimea. It does not mention Russian troops taking over parts of Ukrainian sovereign territory beyond that given to it by agreement. It concludes: Russia repeatedly confirmed it does not doubt Crimea is a part of Ukraine, even though it understands the emotions of the residents of the region. This week Russian MPs initiated a bill that will allow Russian citizenship within six month if the applicant successfully proves his or her Russian ethnicity. It is prepared especially to save Russian-speaking Ukrainians from possible infringement of their rights. According to ITN\u2019s James Mates, Russian troops are clearly patrolling Crimean cities. A Ukrainian journalist reports the anger in Ukraine at the prospect of Crimea\u2019s secession. Haaretz have carried an interview with an ex-Israeli soldier who led one of the militias on the Maidan. He gives his opinions about the existence of anti-semitisim among the Ukrainian protesters. Flights are avoiding airspace near the Crimea. This tweet was from last night but it looks the same now although there are now few aircarft in Ukrainian airspace at all. AP have filed this report from Donetsk in the east of Ukraine where pro-Russian sympathies are strong about the differences between western and eastern Ukrainians. For AP the contrast can be explained by looking at the cities of Donetsk and Lviv. \u201cThe eastern city of Donetsk can seem like a cliche of post-Soviet grimness, a place of Stalinist-era apartment blocks, tin-roofed shacks and loyalty to Russia. In the west, Lviv has emerged as a center for Ukrainian artists and writers, a huge draw for European tourists and a city desperate for closer ties to the West.\u201d \u201cI have always felt that we are so different,\u201d said a miner who gave his name only as Nikolai, a thickset 35-year-old who went from high school directly into the mines. People speak Russian across most of Ukraine\u2019s east, and worship in onion-domed Orthodox churches. They were shaped by 70 years of Soviet rule and its celebration of socialist industrialization, and by the Russian empire before that. To them, the government is now being run by outsiders who care little for this side of the country. \u201cIf they try to pressure us, our region will revolt.\u201d \u201cWe are simply different people from those living in the East,\u201d said Ludmila Petrova, a university student in Lviv, a hotbed of support for Ukraine\u2019s pro-democracy forces and opposition to Yanukovych. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what the West is. We have a different history. Maybe it is better that we separate once and for all.\u201d \u201cThe country is already separated,\u201d said Ivan Reyko, a 30-year-old factory worker from Donetsk who joined a recent demonstration of about 100 people in the city\u2019s main plaza, Lenin Square, where a 30-foot-tall statue of the Soviet hero gazes proudly toward the horizon. \u201cThere is no way back to a united Ukraine.\u201d Here is Russia Today\u2019s report on the alleged kidnap attempt. Unknown armed men from Kiev have tried to seize the Crimean Interior Ministry overnight, and there were several injuries in that attack, Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. \u201cThanks to the decisive action of self-defense squads, the attempt to seize the building of the Interior Ministry was derailed. This attempt confirms the intention of prominent political circles in Kiev to destabilize the situation on the peninsula,\u201d the statement added. Moscow is very concerned with the latest developments in Crimea and thinks any further escalation would be irresponsible, the ministry added. Crimeans began protesting after the new self-proclaimed government in Kiev introduced a law abolishing the use of other languages in official circumstances in Ukraine. More than half the Crimean population are Russian and use only this language for their communication. The residents have announced they are going to hold a referendum on March 30 to determine the fate of the Ukrainian autonomous region.
