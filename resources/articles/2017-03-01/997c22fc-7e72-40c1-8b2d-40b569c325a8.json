The 57-year-old replaced Bob Howden as the chairman last month but was a nonexecutive director on British Cycling\u2019s board from April 2014 onwards. Last week a draft review produced by Annamarie Phelps found an internal investigation into the track cyclist Jess Varnish\u2019s dismissal last year, as well as her allegations of sexism, had been covered up and that, incredibly, the British Cycling board had not only \u201csanitised\u201d but \u201creversed\u201d the findings of its grievance officer. \u201cThe actions of the British Cycling board in that regard are shocking and inexcusable,\u201d it added. \u201cThey also call into serious question whether the composition of the British Cycling board is fit to govern a national sporting body.\u201d Varnish has already called for the resignation of the entire board, including Browning, saying: \u201cIf someone can overturn the findings, facts, they shouldn\u2019t still be there because what else are they going to cover up? It\u2019s shocking and the other athletes shouldn\u2019t be put in the position where if something else does come up there\u2019s nobody backing them and standing up for the truth. They have to go.\u201d Browning has said he is happy to meet Varnish to discuss any concerns she has about the independent review, or on any other matter. However such a meeting appears unlikely, especially now the Observer has established Varnish\u2019s dim view of the board is shared by senior figures in UK Sport. When UK Sport, the funding body that is providing British Cycling with nearly \u00a326m for the Tokyo Olympics, was asked whether it still backed Browning after the leaked Phelps report, which the authors have warned is not the final version and could yet be altered, a spokesperson replied: \u201cUnfortunately we can\u2019t comment given the report hasn\u2019t been published yet. In the meantime we are working to address issues that have been raised by the review and will comment on them fully once the report is published.\u201d British Cycling maintains that UK Sport\u2019s chief executive Liz Nicholl, in full knowledge of what was in the draft independent review, gave her backing to its board at the start of March albeit with a caveat. As she told reporters: \u201cThe reputation of British Cycling is taking a big hit over this period and the responsibility of the leadership of British Cycling is to restore the credibility and reputation through the actions that they take.\u201d Varnish, who has not ruled out legal action against British Cycling, would love to return to the elite programme but is understood to be sceptical how much the organisation has really changed. At the forefront of her mind is that three of the four coaches who were responsible for releasing her last year are still in situ, with only former technical director Shane Sutton having resigned. The independent panel found Varnish lost her funding \u201cas an act of retaliation\u201d for criticising coaching staff at last year\u2019s track world championships in London and was \u201cremoved\u201d from the programme without due warning. It added: \u201cIn the situation involving Jess Varnish the panel did not find explanations convincing from coaching staff that she could go from being a borderline Olympian [in fact, potentially an Olympic medallist] to not being good enough \u2026 within a week. Varnish was not given a warning or any period of time to improve. She was simply removed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
