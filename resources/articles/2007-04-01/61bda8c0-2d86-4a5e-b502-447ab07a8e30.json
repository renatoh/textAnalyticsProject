It was done not because the government had finally been persuaded by the soundness of the arguments in favour of such a ministry, but because something had to be done about the wounded Home Office. The rearrangement of departmental responsibilities has still left blurred areas, not least when the two ministries disagree on the criminal law and policy as it affects anti-terrorism measures. But the main question is a simple one. Will the reorganisation bring about improvements? The answer depends on whether you believe that the lamentable performance of the Home Office has been the result of structural and communication defects caused by its unwieldy size and complexity; or by human failure, the incompetence of staff and ministers alike. If the latter, there is no reason to be optimistic about the reorganisation. The same people are going to be doing the work. In making his announcement last week, the home secretary remarked that he expected future secretaries of state for justice to be accountable to the Commons, and not to be lawyers. I do not know whether he was making an off the cuff remark or conveying thought-out policy. The first part is fine by me; there is no logical argument, other than historical, why the department dealing with justice needs to be headed by a member of the House of Lords. But why does John Reid, or the government, appear so keen to ensure that the job should not be held by a lawyer? Partly, it may be the usual sheer anti-lawyerism. But I think there is a real issue there. In the Department for Constitutional Affairs and before that in the old Lord Chancellor's Department, the top man has always been an experienced lawyer, though several non-lawyers have been junior ministers. Without mentioning names, some were quite good, and some clearly uncomfortable in dealing with legal issues. It was not that they lacked intelligence or ability; but their unfamiliarity with their subject affected their decisions, and their capacity to make sensible policies. I've become convinced over the years that non-lawyers would it find it difficult to do the kind of work involved in leading such a department. But why should the Ministry of Justice be different from other ministries? After all, the argument goes, we don't insist that the health secretary has to be medically qualified, nor that the education secretary have been a teacher. So why should the head of the new justice department have to be a lawyer? I'm not saying that he or she necessarily has to be legally qualified; but I do believe that knowledge of the law and the legal system would be an immense help to enable him or her to do the job properly. Ahealth secretary can run a good department without medical knowledge. A justice secretary would be hampered by a lack of knowledge of law and the legal scene, which cannot easily be picked up from briefing papers. Geoff Hoon, Jack Straw and Harriet Harman are all possibles to succeed Lord Falconer. There is no urgent need to look elsewhere, just because John Reid and others don't like lawyers. Isn't it time to change the name of the Home Office? Even before the latest offloading, it had over the years lost many of its traditional responsibilities. It will now concentrate on security and control, but naming a department after those two functions may be too Orwellian, even for this government."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
