They overhauled their target with almost 17 overs to spare. For 24 hours at least they are second in the table. But any celebrations were tempered by injury worries on a day when the medical teams of both sides had little respite. Jason Roy left the field most lugubriously with a hamstring problem. Later Eoin Morgan also retired to the pavilion at a funereal pace, suffering from back spasms. It would have taken an emergency for either of them to bat. There was never any suggestion of an emergency after England had been set a modest target of 213 for victory. This was due to the highly reassuring presence of Joe Root, who, after taking two vital wickets, opened the batting for the first time in ODI cricket and then delivered the most polished of hundreds. He was the obvious man of the match, albeit a truncated one, which was a disappointment for those who revel in a tight contest. Root added 95 with Jonny Bairstow after which his alliance with the latest No 3, Chris Woakes, took England towards the simplest of victories. Woakes batted fluently for his 40. Indeed, there were moments as he cracked the ball to the boundary square on the off-side when it was necessary to squint from the stands to check the batsman\u2019s identity. With Root in such sublime form this was quite a compliment for Woakes. West Indies endured a wretched day, which was exacerbated by injury concerns of their own. Andre Russell hobbled grimly from the field after completing his second over and his continued presence in this tournament must be in doubt. At the start both captains were eager to win the toss since heavy clouds, which would soon disperse, hovered over the ground. There was a touch of moisture in the air and movement off the pitch. So it was a struggle for most of the West Indian batsmen. Evin Lewis, out of form and maybe out of the team before long, was bowled off his pads by Woakes in the third over. Chris Gayle, by contrast, was watchful against the new balls, statuesque at the crease and content to let the short deliveries pass by. Then he struck two consecutive boundaries off Jofra Archer like a master dismissing a troublesome pupil from his presence. However, it transpired that Archer\u2019s confidence would not be dented by this experience. On 15, Gayle swung at a full-length delivery from Woakes and sliced the ball in the air towards third man. Mark Wood took a while to locate its flightpath and then sprinted in. He ending up diving forwards and dropping a difficult catch. Woakes was unusually distraught by this missed opportunity; so was Morgan, which betrayed how much England valued Gayle\u2019s wicket. Woakes\u2019s mood was not lightened when Gayle soon struck him for four and six from consecutive deliveries. But the damage would not be too great. Gayle swung at another short ball from Liam Plunkett and the ensuing top-edge was calmly taken by Bairstow on the square-leg boundary. Shai Hope fell two balls later, palpably lbw to Wood even though England were obliged to review Kumar Dharmasena\u2019s not out decision. The new generation of West Indies batsmen, Nicholas Pooran and Shimron Hetmyer, restored faith with an 89-run partnership. Initially, these talented left-handers found it difficult to time the ball but when Root was introduced they were accelerating smoothly and West Indies could have anticipated a score not far short of 300. But the mischievous Root then made two crucial interventions. He clearly enjoys the diversion of bowling and has the confidence to employ several variations that might be considered too risky for more serious bowlers. He restricted himself to off-spinners and soon one of them gripped just enough to persuade Hetmyer to present a sharp return catch, gleefully accepted by the bowler. He then greeted Jason Holder with one of his leg-breaks, slightly over-pitched. Soon after the West Indies captain struck a straight six, which prompted Root to propel a cunning arm ball just outside leg stump. Somehow Holder contrived to give a simple return catch from the leading edge of his bat. Root celebrated like David Warner reaching his century at Taunton. West Indies never recovered from these two unexpected setbacks. The fact that Woakes dropped a straightforward catch from the bat of Russell did not matter much. Jos Buttler, now deputising for Morgan, could summon up his two express bowlers, Archer and Wood, and they polished off the innings rapidly. This particular West Indian tail, with Sheldon Cottrell at No 9, is long and thin. Archer and Wood finished with three cheap wickets each. Any short-term anxiety in the England dressing room about their injured batsmen was quickly dispelled by Root and his willing assistants. He cover drove sweetly and pulled with majesty, barely missing a ball along the way, cruising to his 16th ODI century and his second of the tournament in 94 balls as the target was brushed aside. However, the concerns about Roy and Morgan remain. England will not replace them in a hurry since the decision to call up any reinforcements cannot be reversed. If necessary the injured pair could be replaced by James Vince and Moeen Ali for England\u2019s next match against Afghanistan on Tuesday. Encouragingly, Morgan was fit enough to talk to Nasser Hussain at the end."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
