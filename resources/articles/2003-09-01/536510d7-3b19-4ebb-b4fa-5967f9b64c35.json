Uncertainty ruled in response to the query, \"Will you still be in charge of the side for Saturday's trip to Gillingham?\", before Brooking stuttered: \"I don't know. \"We will know more on Wednesday. Having two games so close together meant I always expected to be in charge of the team tonight.\" Alan Pardew is understood to be ready to assume control at Upton Park but there is no doubt that the West Ham supporters would prefer Brooking - and not for reasons of sentiment or keeping the job in the Hammers family. Brooking may be a reluctant caretaker but management is proving a breeze for the former England midfielder on last night's evidence, after Hammers settled the first ever league meeting between the two clubs inside 25 minutes. The victory was the fourth in succession since Brooking took temporary charge but this gave him fresh reason for satisfaction. He said: \"The others have all been achieved by the odd goal so it was terrific to win like this, especially so quickly.\" West Ham were aided and abetted, however, by some woeful defending that presented them with their first two goals. David Connolly took full advantage of both lapses. For the first he dispossessed the procrastinating Stephen Foster, and his second was simplicity itself after the goal keeper Clayton Ince failed to hold a powerful free-kick from Kevin Horlock. At least Crewe refused to be cowed even after Matthew Etherington's thunderous shot from the edge of the penalty area settled matters and sent West Ham level top on points and behind Wigan only on goals scored. Crewe ended the half on the attack with Kenny Lunt forcing a sharp save from David James before spiritedly trying to reduce the deficit after the interval. The young striker Dean Ashton was a particular source of trouble. He climaxed one neat move with a left-foot shot which just cleared the bar, then his right-foot shot forced a diving save from James."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
