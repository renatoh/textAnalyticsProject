In a case which has provoked a fresh row with America over Washington's refusal to cooperate with British inquests, Andrew Walker said it was unacceptable that the US had failed to release evidence about the incident. He said it made his job more difficult and the experience of the grieving families more harrowing. The helicopter, an American Sea Knight, crashed south of the Kuwait border in March 2003 on the first day of the Iraq invasion. Four US marines also died. An American inquiry found pilot error was to blame. It concluded that \"spatial disorientation\" suffered by the US Marine Corps pilots led to the helicopter plunging nose first to the ground. It was suggested at the Oxford inquest that the US explanation for the crash might have been designed to avoid grounding its Sea Knights to correct any mechanical failure. Though a British board of inquiry by 3 Commando Brigade found technical failure was to blame, British navy chiefs endorsed the US conclusion that the pilots were at fault. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said yesterday: \"Both conclusions were presented to the families as there was no way to definitely establish the cause of this tragic accident.\" Recording a narrative verdict today, Mr Walker, assistant deputy coroner for Oxfordshire - bodies of repatriated UK service personnel are flown into RAF Brize Norton, near Oxford - said there was \"no evidence whatsoever\" of pilot error on the basis of the evidence he had seen. \"The aircraft was flying at low altitude in straight level flight when a runaway [a mechanical fault] in both the differential air speed hold actuators [components within the helicopter] caused the aircraft to lose control and strike the ground at 23.35 hours local time [on March 21 2003].\" Mr Walker recommended that US Sea Knight aircraft be fitted with \"black box\" flight data recorders. He said it was unacceptable that the US had failed to release evidence about the incident. Though the US eventually provided the coroner with a report into the crash, Mr Walker said all the important conclusive analysis had been removed. Last month Mr Walker castigated the US for its refusal to cooperate with the inquest into the death of Lance Corporal of Horse Matty Hull, killed by an American pilot in a \"friendly fire\" incident in Iraq. He called the killing a \"criminal, unlawful act\" tantamount to manslaughter, and \"an entirely avoidable tragedy\". The British victims were from 3 Commando Brigade based in Plymouth. They included: Royal Marines Colour Sergeant John Cecil, 35, of Plymouth; Captain Philip Guy, 29, from Bishopdale, North Yorkshire; Marine Sholto Hedenskog, 26, from Cape Town, South Africa; Warrant Officer 2 Mark Stratford, 39, from Plymouth; and Major Jason Ward, 34, from Torquay. Also killed were Operator Mechanic (Communications) Second Class Ian Seymour, 29, and Sgt Les Hehir, 34, both from Poole, Dorset; and Lance Bombardier Llywelyn Evans, 24, of Llandudno, north Wales."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
