But if the club is to be believed, then it is perhaps Frank Rijkaard who stands the best chance of transforming a deteriorating season. The Dutchman is available, having been out of work since resigning from Barcelona last summer after a successful five-year reign at Camp Nou. Rijkaard's finest achievement, if not winning back-to-back La Liga titles, was the 2006 Champions League triumph when a glittering side led by Deco, Ronaldinho and Samuel Eto'o came from a goal behind to beat Arsenal 2\u20131 in Paris. In his playing days the Dutchman, still just 46, was a sublime midfielder whose CV included three European Cups with Ajax and Milan, and membership of Holland's 1988 European Championship-winning side. That pedigree means that walking into the Stamford Bridge changing room and commanding respect from a squad of high-earning internationals should be easy enough, at least initially. His Champions League win as manager will excite John Terry, Frank Lampard, Joe Cole and other senior Chelsea players, as the European Cup is the one trophy to have eluded them since Roman Abramovich transformed Chelsea six years ago. Yet the club's desire finally to claim the continent's premier club competition reached its nadir once Terry missed the penalty in the shoot-out of last year's final in Moscow that allowed Manchester United to emerge victorious at their expense. Of course, Rijkaard will be fully aware of the internecine politics at Chelsea that have now forced out three managers in less than 18 months. Chelsea, too, might also be aware that Rijkaard had his own problems dealing with the ego-heavy Barcelona changing room towards the end of his tenure in Spain, and his former assistant at Bar\u00e7a, the combative Henk ten Cate, was No2 to Avram Grant at Chelsea and an unpopular figure among the players. Yet Rijkaard might argue that this experience has primed him for anything Stamford Bridge might and surely would throw at him. Carlo Ancelotti The Milan coach is unlikely to be available before the summer but Chelsea may still attempt to bring him in now or make a short-term appointment with a view to having the Italian in charge from next season. Chelsea discussed the post with him last summer before appointing Scolari. The 49-year-old has won the Champions League twice with Milan but is in the Uefa Cup this season after failing to qualify for Europe's leading club competition. Gianfranco Zola Inexperience is his primary shortcoming but his fledgling career has got off to a promising start at West Ham. Much of the credit goes to his assistant, Steve Clarke, who may follow him back to Stamford Bridge should he be appointed. Guus Hiddink Is much admired by Roman Abramovich, who was instrumental in the Dutchman taking charge of Russia and may not particularly want him to leave that post. At 62, however, he is not believed to be keen on returning to club management. Didier Deschamps Another former Chelsea player. His greatest achievement was guiding Monaco to the 2004 Champions League final, beating Claudio Ranieri's Chelsea in the semi-finals. He also won Serie B with Juventus but is currently now out of work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
