The row is the latest twist to a prolonged dispute between the recently merged university and the lecturers' union Natfhe over new contracts, which staff say is affecting morale. In September 150 staff burned copies of the proposed contract at a protest. The union said the dismissal notice was issued just as it had agreed with the university to use its disputes committee to consider ways of resolving the long-standing dispute over 387 former London Guildhall staff moving to a new contract similar to the one used at the former University of North London before the merger of the two institutions. It said the lecturer concerned has been working normally and there was no criticism of his work. He is one of three lecturers who have informed the university's management that they do not accept the new contract. A second lecturer has also been told he will be dismissed. The head of Natfhe's higher education department, Roger Kline, said: \"The timing of these dismissals is astonishing. Just two days after the university accepted Natfhe's suggestion of using the disputes committee, the employers have taken this unnecessary action. This will undoubtedly escalate the dispute - and many will draw the conclusion it is designed to do so. \"The university has damaged any immediate chance of progress and many staff will now question whether the current management want a negotiated settlement. The university's governors must wonder what is happening as London Met's name becomes mud in the academic world,\" said Mr Kline. He added that a meeting of the university's members had been called for Wednesday to consider a \"robust response\". \"What does this say about the university's professed concern for students when they sack two lecturers about whom there have been no complaints, and whose only crime is to object to the new contract. We are not going to sit on our hands while this happens.\" The university today declined to comment on the dispute."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
