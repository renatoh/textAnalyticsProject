We never heard any word from them since the day they called us, so we decided to delete the direct debit. Nothing had been debited from my account at this time and I believed that would be the end of the matter. On checking my bank account in January, I noticed two payments to the Money Club \u2013 \u00a35 on 23 December and \u00a398 on 28 December. IW, Hornchurch, Essex The Money Club insists it did post you a membership pack and has also been emailing you each week with special offers. You say you have received nothing. The \u00a35 charge was for a month's trial membership, which the Money Club tried to collect a week after the phone call. The transaction failed, so it tried again a month later, by which time the annual fee was due although that did not leave your bank account because you had, by then, cancelled the direct debit. I can only warn readers not to give their bank account details to anyone following a cold call. You can always contact a company later to go ahead after you have had time to decide if you really want the goods or service.
