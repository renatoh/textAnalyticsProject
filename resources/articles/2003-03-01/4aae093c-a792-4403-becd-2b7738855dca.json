The rumours sufaced in a Commons debate this afternoon. Junior Foreign Office minister Mike O'Brien revealed that his department was investigating reports from a \"Bulgarian source\" that Mr Aziz had given himself up and defected to Kurdish-controlled territory in northern Iraq. If the information is correct, it would represent a major blow to the Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, even before any bombs have started falling. Washington has been hoping for defection in the Iraqi leadership, or a coup that could avert the need for war. However, US government officials strongly disputed reports that Mr Aziz had defected or was injured. They said that there was no information to corroborate the reports. Iraq has also moved to quash the rumours, but the Baghdad regime has yet to release a detailed statement. Other sources insisted this afternoon that Mr Aziz had defected. Nabez Rashid Ahmad, the deputy director for the KDP Sulaymaniyah branch, said: \"He's in KDP-controlled land.\" He gave his location as the Irbil region, but gave no details of when, where or how the purported surrender took place. Ismail Sayer, an Iraqi opposition figure in the Democratic Platform of Iraq, also said, in a statement faxed from Sofia, Bulgaria, that Mr Aziz had given himself up. But the KDP spokesman in the northern city of Irbil, Fawzi Hariri, said: \"We've heard the reports and we don't confirm them.\" Mr Aziz is the only Christian in the Iraqi leadership, and is one of Iraq's best-known voices to the world. He was born in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, and is thought to have close ties in the area."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
