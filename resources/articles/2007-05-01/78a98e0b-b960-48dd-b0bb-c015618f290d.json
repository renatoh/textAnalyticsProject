Sir Igor's motive is wholly good - to prevent miscarriages of justice. Yet I do not believe his proposal would have that result. His argument, outlined last week in a speech marking the 10th anniversary of the Criminal Cases Review Commission, is that an appeal against a jury's conviction may require appeal judges to decide on the truthfulness of a witness. They have a transcript of the evidence, but that gives no indication of the body language and demeanour of the witness, or whether, as Sir Igor noted, they hesitated unexpectedly or gabbled through the evidence. His solution is to video and keep witnesses' evidence, in case of an appeal. I have two main reservations. The first, which we all know from personal experience and is no different in the courts, is that liars are often very good at giving convincing evidence, while honest people may seem unsure or evasive - a trait likely to be enhanced by nervousness when giving evidence in the intimidating atmosphere of a court. The hesitations or gabbling Sir Igor mentions are far from being reliable indicators of lying. In films, yes; in real life, less so. My other objection is more fundamental. One of the main justifications for having jurors is that they reach their decisions using common sense and their experience of everyday life, which includes the ability to assess whether someone is telling the truth. Indeed, the argument that juries ought not to be used in trials where the evidence is complex (fraud cases, for instance) attracts the response - not least by judges themselves - that even apparently complicated cases often boil down to deciding who is telling the truth, something juries are amply competent to do. Two or three appeal court judges have no greater claim to being right than 12 jurors. And a court should not reverse a jury's verdict merely because the judges feel differently about the veracity of a witness's evidence. It was a safe bet Lord Falconer would lose his job as soon as his friend Tony Blair relinquished his. Indeed, Falconer chatted openly, without hint of regret, about his expected political demise. No longer. The new secretary of state for justice has had a new lease of life. He's making clear he wants to carry on. Perhaps he has been given a hint from the future prime minister that his services will continue to be wanted. What is certain is that acquiring a huge department, especially one which includes responsibility for prisons, has pumped him full of adrenalin, and he's teeming with ideas on penal policy - including selling off our large, stern Victorian prisons and their replacement by smaller local institutions. But will he get the chance to implement his ideas?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
