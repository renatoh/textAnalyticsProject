Britain's improved performance against New Zealand has been reflected with four players, Andy Farrell, Stuart Fielden, Keith Senior and Paul Sculthorpe, named in the World XIII compared to only one, Keiron Cunningham, last year. Australia only have six players in the team, even though they humiliated the Lions 64-10 in Sydney in July then beat New Zealand in October, with no place for last year's Golden Boot winner Andrew Johns, who misses out to Jones at scrum-half. Bradford have confirmed the signing of Karl Pratt, the Britain wing who won his release from Leeds on a free transfer at a tribunal last week, on a three-year contract. World XIII: Lockyer (Aus); Tahu (Aus), Vagana (NZ), Senior (GB), Hazem El Masri (Aus and Leb); Fittler (Aus), Jones (NZ); Webcke (Aus), Swain (NZ), Fielden (GB), Tallis (Aus), Farrell (GB), Sculthorpe (GB)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
