Moffett and other WRU officials met premier club representatives yesterday to work out a way forward for the professional game after the nine clubs this week unanimously rejected the provincial plan which would see the players centrally contracted and one team based in north Wales. The premier clubs want five regional teams to be created from their ranks, but they cannot agree on who should merge with whom. They have been given a week by Moffett to put together a detailed proposal and the benefactors of the clubs are meeting in Cardiff next Monday, with the clubs and the union continuing negotiations the following Thursday. A bland statement issued after yesterday's meeting described the discussions as amicable. \"Moffett was more conciliatory than he had been the previous week,\" said one club official. \"He has an open mind on the number of sides which should be funded but if he is to compromise we will have to concede in turn: there will be central contracts unless the clubs agree that the play ers will never again threaten to strike as they did before the international between Wales and England last March, and there will be a cap on wages.\" Several players in Wales, not all of them in the national squad, command six-figure salaries but under Moffett's plans the bulk of the players in the new squads will earn \u00a335,000, with a selected few banking between \u00a350,000 and \u00a360,000 and the captains taking home \u00a380,000. The door will not be closed on players not qualified to play for Wales but they will be strictly rationed in number and will have to be of proven pedigree. \"The clubs now have to agree on where the five sides should be based,\" said the official. \"Neath and Bridgend are creat ing the problem because they want to merge with each other while a majority of the clubs want Neath to join up with Swansea and Bridgend to unite with Pontypridd. It is significant that the word from Ireland is that they want to expand the Celtic league to a home-and-away tournament with five Welsh teams involved.\" The England squad will gather next week for their final time this year. The head coach Clive Woodward has named the same 33 players chosen before the start of the November series of internationals, though some, including the prop Trevor Woodman and the centre Mike Catt, may not be fit by the start of the Six Nations Championship in February. Saracens are the favourites to sign the 25-year-old Bradford Bulls and Great Britain wing Nathan McAvoy after he refused to sign a new contract with the rugby league club, who won the Middlesex Sevens last summer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
