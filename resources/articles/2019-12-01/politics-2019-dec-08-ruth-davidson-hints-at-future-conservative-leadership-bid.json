Davidson quit as the party\u2019s leader in Scotland after nearly eight years in August, citing \u201cthe conflict\u201d she felt over Brexit and her desire to spend more time with her family. In an interview for the Sunday Telegraph\u2019s Stella magazine, the MSP for Edinburgh Central hinted that she could re-enter politics when her one-year-old son was older. \u201cIt may well be that my time in politics doesn\u2019t come again until we\u2019re in opposition,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve probably got more experience than anyone in the party on how to lead from opposition. \u201cIf someone tapped on my door and asked me to help, I\u2019d be there in a heartbeat. But at the moment, I\u2019ve got four or five years when my son isn\u2019t at school and that is not a time that I\u2019m contemplating moving 450 miles away for the majority of the week. It\u2019s just some things are more important than politics.\u201d Davidson is considered the most successful leader of the Scottish Conservative party since devolution. She campaigned to stay in the European Union in the 2016 referendum and had been open about her reservations about Boris Johnson\u2019s leadership of the Conservative party before her resignation. In the interview published on Sunday, she also spoke about coming out to her family as gay and about the homophobic abuse she has received as a politician. \u201cI was in my mid-20s [when I came out] \u2013 quite late,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know for ages, which is surprising, looking back. I came out to one member of my very close family, it didn\u2019t go well, so I didn\u2019t come out to the rest for two years.\u201d Davidson said she could get up to 1,000 abusive tweets a day when she was Scottish Tory leader. \u201cIt wears you down. I\u2019ve had a lot of \u2018string her up by a lamppost\u2019 type stuff; \u2018unionists, turncoats, traitors\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I had an incident where someone got my phone number and made threats. It turned out not to be that sinister, but I didn\u2019t know that when I was being told they wanted to burn all gays.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
