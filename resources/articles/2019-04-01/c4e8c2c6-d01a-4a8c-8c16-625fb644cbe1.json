Howard Schultz is hiring a social media manager", "bodyText": "Howard Schultz, the former Starbucks boss, has been toying with a presidential run. He claims that he, as an independent white male billionaire, can solve America\u2019s real problem: not enough centrism. As his potential candidacy takes heat online \u2013 critics call him out of touch and Democrats fear he\u2019ll hurt their cause \u2013 his team is advertising for a social media community manager. Do you have what it takes to defend a man whose former company has become an international symbol of gentrification? Here\u2019s a rundown of the skills the job requires: \u2018Manage all incoming communications via social channels, monitoring throughout the day\u2019 These incoming communications, for example, might include queries about Schultz\u2019s self-proclaimed inability to see color. Responding to concerns in February over the arrest of two African American men at a Starbucks, he told listeners: \u201cAs somebody who grew up in a very diverse background as a young boy in the projects, I didn\u2019t see color as a young boy and I honestly don\u2019t see color now.\u201d As social media community manager, you\u2019ll need to be ready with a hilarious gif when you are inundated with a flood of posts pointing out that racism is built into America\u2019s cultural fabric. \u201cWhen Schultz brags he doesn\u2019t see race, he is saying that he doesn\u2019t see me,\u201d Jamil Smith wrote at Rolling Stone. Please attach witty retorts to your application. \u2018Address important mentions in real time through engagement\u2019 Important mentions might include that time when MSNBC\u2019s Ali Velshi called your potential future boss a \u201crich guy\u201d and Schultz appeared deeply confused. Velshi explained America\u2019s division to Schultz: \u201cIt\u2019s not because of the Democrats and Republicans,\u201d Velshi said. \u201cIt\u2019s about rich people who don\u2019t pay taxes.\u201d Though Schultz\u2019s reaction involved a dead-eyed stare, the social media community manager would be expected to engage with Velshi, perhaps explaining that Schultz didn\u2019t see taxes as a young boy and Starbucks honestly doesn\u2019t want to see taxes now. \u2018Adjust course as required by changing market conditions\u2019 Schultz himself has had trouble with this one, as market conditions suggest that he is everyone\u2019s least favorite candidate. Though he shows no sign of adjusting course, our social media community manager should be more dynamic. If, for example, someone calls your boss an \u201cegotistical billionaire asshole\u201d and raises legitimate concerns about him \u201cgetting ratioed on Twitter\u201d \u2013 that is, getting more comments than likes or retweets \u2013 it\u2019s time for you to consider focusing on coffee, not politics. \u2018Develop strong relationships within the online community by knowing your audience\u2019 Another area in which you\u2019ll be making up for your boss\u2019s failings: his audience fears he\u2019ll be responsible for the re-election of Donald Trump, and polling suggests they have reason to worry. According to Politico, Democrats are more willing to back third parties than Republicans are; meanwhile, an Optimus poll finds a Schultz run would bolster the current president. But wait: Schultz says a \u201csilent majority\u201d wants a middle-of-the-road candidate. Where is this majority and why aren\u2019t they tweeting? It\u2019s your job to find out. \u2018Stay abreast of new opportunities in the industry\u2019 After a week in this job, you\u2019re going to want them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
