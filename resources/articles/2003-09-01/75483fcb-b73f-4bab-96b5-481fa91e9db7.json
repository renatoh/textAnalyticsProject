The war in Iraq caused postbags to swell and email queues to clog as people around the world wrote to debate the causes of the conflict or to challenge its coverage. In Istanbul last week the Organisation of News Ombudsmen drew collective breath and asked whether newspapers, TV and radio had learned any lessons from the war and its increasingly messy aftermath. David Ignatius, former editor of the International Herald Tribune and now a syndicated columnist on the Washington Post, believed that US journalists needed to be self-critical. The frailty of evidence on weapons of mass destruction and Saddam's links with al-Qaeda was discussed in the American press but never reached 'critical mass' - that moment when the media, bludgeoning away at a story, changes the way a nation thinks. 'There was no wide debate in the US about the war,' he said. 'And the Democrats didn't speak out; they believed that their opposition in 1991 had damaged them.' The inevitability of war meant the media was too busy preparing for it to have the debate about whether it was right. Ignatius's own paper had sent staff to Kuwait for desert training in December last year, yet the war did not start until 30 March. All this bore out what I and my colleagues in the UK had experienced in the run-up to the war: a deluge of emails from the US, praising British newspaper websites (including, if I might blow a trumpet for a moment, those of The Observer and our sister paper the Guardian ) for their reporting, their depth of analysis and their willingness to debate the issues. We are not getting this in the US press, the emailers would say. Now newspapers in Europe and the US are criticising the Bush administration for not adequately planning for the aftermath of war, yet the media, too, failed to predict what might happen after Saddam was overthrown, and was left unprepared to cover the ensuing mess. Reporter Ivan Watson, of America's National Public Radio, flew in from Baghdad for the conference and gave a vivid account of the chaos in the streets of the Iraqi capital and the difficulties faced by reporters trying to make sense of it. He, along with The Observer's Ed Vulliamy, doubted whether 'embedding' with the military ever helped journalists get to the truth. Both preferred to operate independently when covering conflicts, but conceded that embedding naturally offered a safer environment for reporters and photographers. Vulliamy raised the temperature by stating that reporters who witnessed the horrors of war had a moral duty to testify at war crimes tribunals. He felt passionately that reporters should not escape telling what they know in open court when the crimes are so enor mous. This flies directly in the face of several traditional tenets of journalism and drew strong criticism from David Ignatius, who felt that journalists would never get to the truth if they were seen to be part of the judicial process. I can see this debate running for a long while to come. The small worldwide community of ombudsmen is soon to be joined by a new figure, the public editor at the New York Times. 'We are the ombudsmen,' was the management's lofty response to criticism in the past. The ombudsman has not been named yet, but Bill Kovach's name has been mentioned. The former Washington Post bureau chief and leading writer on press ethics would be ideal - but it may only be wishful thinking. It took the earthquake of the Jayson Blair scandal for the NYT to act. Blair, a 27 year-old reporter on the paper, resigned after being exposed as a plagiarist and serial inventor of stories in a scandal that rocked the paper, and eventually cost the two top editors their jobs. Joann Byrd, a member of the Siegal committee set up to investigate the scandal, told the Istanbul meeting that lack of communication between editorial departments at the NYT allowed Blair to get away with his fabrications. Despite an alarming number of corrections arising from his stories he continued to be employed. 'Any newsroom is dependent on trust,' said Byrd. 'We all understand the need for accuracy and honesty and we just assume we all have it.' Clearly, there wasn't enough talking going on at the NYT . Now the paper is to appoint a standards editor who will work with the staff, setting guidelines, while the public editor will listen to readers and respond to complaints. 'The single most important thing for a public editor is to be independent of the news process,' said Byrd. 'You listen with an open ear.' One of the most striking things to come out of the scandal was that even those who had been misreported in Blair's stories often didn't contact the monolithic paper because they believed that no one would listen to them. However, for all these good intentions, the management at the NYT has announced that it will try the new appointments for a year, and then review the situation: hardly a ringing endorsement of a system tried and tested elsewhere, and certainly not enough time to change the paper's culture into a more accountable one. They should be talking to Alan Rusbridger, editor of the Guardian, who went to Istanbul to urge other newspapers, particularly in Britain, to create ombudsmen in their newsrooms. He described his appointment of Ian Mayes as readers' editor six years ago as 'the single most liberating act of my editorship'. The case for an ombudsman, he said, was essentially a simple one: a press that holds others to be accountable should be accountable itself.
