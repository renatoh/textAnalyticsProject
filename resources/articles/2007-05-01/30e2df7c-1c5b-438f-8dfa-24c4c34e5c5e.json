All three were tied on three under par, and it took four extra holes and four birdies at the par-five 18th before Hauert claimed the \u00a352,000 prize for her maiden victory on the Ladies' European Tour. England's Trish Johnson (74) and Wales's Eleanor Pilgrim (68) tied for fifth place on one under par. Marti had birdied the last two holes for a 70, to set the target of three under par, and Hauert had an even better finish with birdies at her final three holes for a 68 to force a play-off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
