A white paper to be published next month on tackling rogue doctors will also signal that the growing number of therapists and alternative health practitioners, who can now set up with no form of registration or fear of sanctions, will in the longer term be brought under regulatory control. While doctors can be struck off for incompetent or unethical behaviour - the General Medical Council's latest proposed code of conduct bans not only sex with current patients for fear of exploitation, but with ex-patients after treatment stops - there is no compulsory regulation for counsellors, therapists and practitioners of techniques such as acupuncture or hypnotherapy, who have regular contact with vulnerable people, usually women. The need for the new regulations to provide clarity for alternative practitioners is highlighted by an Observer investigation into one of Britain's best known alternative therapists, whose actions have triggered complaints of alleged sexual misconduct. The 'Barefoot Doctor' - known to millions from his TV career, his range of products stocked by high-street chemists and a form of healing based on Tao philosophy - has been forced to issue an extraordinary statement admitting to having sex with ex-patients in the past. He also confessed to an encounter with a woman on Hampstead Heath during which he remarked on 'sexual tensions' between them. She had initially approached him for a private healing session. He admitted exchanging what he calls 'salacious' emails with women who approached him because they admired his work. However, Barefoot, real name Stephen Russell, denies allegations made to the patient group Witness that he made sexual overtures to patients in treatment. Russell was previously an Observer columnist, although the complaints came to light after he left the paper, and now says he no longer practises. Yesterday he confessed the emails were 'really stupid' but insisted the women approached him as a 'celebrity', not a doctor, adding: 'They were fans, people who would say, \"I love your writing and you are so sexy\" and in a weak moment [you say], \"That's nice, tell me about you...\" It wasn't coming from sick people asking for help. What they are doing is trying to twist it around to make it look like that. It's very similar to if you were a fan of a pop star.' His statement was posted on a private section of his website after a number of women accusing him of sexually predatory behaviour posted on the site. Russell insists that, while he met the unnamed woman at a healing workshop and she later contacted him for a healing appointment, he met her to talk 'not as a healer, with her as a patient, but as a man in great need of solace'. Jonathan Coe of Witness said his organisation had received five complaints about Russell relating to patients in treatment at the time of the alleged incident and ex-patients and warned such allegations could become more commonplace under the government's planned expansion of so-called 'talking therapies' to replace anti-depressants for mental-health patients. 'Movement is shifting more towards the provision of talking treatments and our view is there needs to be proper regulation in place in order that people are protected,' he said. 'The public wants change, the government wants change and I think they are going to have to see that through.' Currently, Coe said, victims of non-regulated therapists had no alternative but to pursue civil lawsuits for breach of trust. The Health Minister, Andy Burnham, is to publish the white paper that calls for the extension of the regulations and will also call for a shift from criminal to civil standards of proof in GMC prosecutions of doctors, making it easier to convict those who indecently assault patients - cases usually involving one person's word against another's. Burnham's paper is expected to argue that justice must not only be done but be 'seen to be done' against rogue doctors, accepting GMC proposals to put an equal number of lay people alongside doctors on its adjudicating panels. It is also expected to recommend shifting the burden of proof, although ministers will say that in cases where a doctor faces the removal of his livelihood the evidence must be more robust. A Department of Health spokesman said the plans were not yet fully finalised, but added: 'We are committed to a system of professional regulation that ensures patient safety and is fair to professionals.'
