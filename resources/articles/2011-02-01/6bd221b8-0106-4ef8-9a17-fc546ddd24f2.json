Recently, she said my behaviour is driving a wedge between us. After missing her for two weeks, I look forward to sex. However, if she is not in the mood, or too tired from her course, or from my arriving late at night, I become withdrawn, quiet and angry. I try to fight these feelings but, ultimately it results in my giving her the cold shoulder. She says sex is no longer enjoyable as she feels pressured. She feels that if she doesn't comply I will punish her. We have decided to abstain until she feels ready. I don't want to be this way. Your girlfriend is not rejecting you. Some people find it hard to connect their longing for someone with the reality of seeing them again. They need a period of adjustment before their bodies catch up with their mental desire. If you try to rush, you will push your girlfriend away. Discuss with her what she needs. Does she want caring touches to start with, rather than sexual ones? Or does she first need to feel connected via relaxed conversation and laughter? Perhaps she simply needs reassurance, as separations tend to raise questions about fidelity. She may need to feel seduced all over again, each time you are reunited. I understand that it is difficult for you not to have sex the minute you see her, but she is wired differently, so slow down. \u2022 Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a clinical psychologist and psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders. \u2022 Send your problem to private.lives@theguardian.com \u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 25 February 2010 to more accurately reflect the reader's question"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
