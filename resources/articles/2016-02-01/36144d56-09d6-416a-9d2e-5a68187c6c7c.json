We were the free-school-meal kids,\u201d Susan says. \u201cNo school trips \u2013 because my mum and dad couldn\u2019t afford them. Secondhand clothes. Steve and I were teenage sweethearts. We met 20 years ago and right from the start we\u2019ve strived to do better; to give our children a different life.\u201d When she was 15, Susan had her first job, as a \u201cSunday supermarket till girl\u201d. She is proud that since then she has never been without employment. Eventually she found a job in housing, attended every training scheme offered, and now earns \u00a329,000 a year. Stephen runs the post room for a large organisation and has a salary of \u00a327,000. The family \u2013 with a daughter aged 10, and a son, 14 \u2013 live 20 minutes from their workplaces and the children\u2019s schools, in a three-bedroom social housing maisonette that has been their home for eight years. They are near friends and relatives. They pay Southwark council \u00a3550 a month, while the local market rent is \u00a31,700 a month. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got lots of rungs on the ladder to climb in our careers and that was something to celebrate. We want to progress,\u201d Susan says. \u201cBut now that\u2019s all changed. One of us may have to cut back. It\u2019s very scary.\u201d Steve and Susan\u2019s combined income is \u00a356,000 a year. For many people living outside the south-east, that might look like a high level of affluence, but factor in London\u2019s housing costs and a harsh reality dawns. And that will become even more brutal if the government\u2019s \u201cpay-to-stay\u201d scheme, part of the housing and planning bill currently going through the House of Lords, becomes law in April 2017. Under the policy, announced in last year\u2019s budget, families or individuals with a total income of \u00a340,000 a year in London, and \u00a330,000 outside the capital, will have to pay the rental market rate, with the increase going not to local councils but to the Treasury. Housing associations can voluntarily impose the cap, and retain the higher rents. Originally the cap was \u00a3100,000. According to the London Tenants Federation, a family with an income of \u00a340,000 paying an average market rent in London will be \u00a311,963 worse off than if earning just less than \u00a340,000. The chancellor, George Osborne, estimates that pay to stay will save the government \u00a3250m a year and affect 10% of social housing tenants. Pat Turnbull, 68, a retired teacher, is chair of the tenants\u2019 association on her estate in Hackney, where she has lived for 18 years. She and her partner of 33 years, Mick, have modest pensions that put them just above the \u00a340,000 cap. Pat\u2019s 35-year-old son also lives with them, as his salary doesn\u2019t stretch to a London rent. \u201cMick and I are on a fixed income. We don\u2019t have the option to change jobs or reduce our hours to come under the cap,\u201d Pat says. \u201cIf pay to stay is imposed, we could see our rent triple, which means half our income will be gone before we begin to meet bills for electricity, council tax, water. We are also assured tenants, which means that if we fall into rent arrears for longer than two months, we could be evicted.\u201d In the Observer last week, analysis of the impact of pay to stay by Savills estate agency for the Local Government Association triggered a huge response from readers. Savills found that 214,000 households would be hit by the policy across England. In London, most of the 27,000 households affected will be unable to afford to rent privately or to buy in the same area. Camden is one of the London boroughs most affected by the change, with more than 2,000 families seeing a sharp increase in bills. \u201cYou could have a family of three or four on low-paid or part-time work who have to find another \u00a315,000 a year for a two-bedroom flat if they reach the cap,\u201d says Sarah Hayward, Labour leader of the council. \u201cOsborne says this will save money. I can\u2019t see how. If people are asking for a pay cut or reducing their hours or deciding to give up work to stay under the cap, that\u2019s not good for tax returns to the Treasury. Pay to stay needs scrapping.\u201d In 2010 David Cameron said: \u201cWe support social housing, we will protect it, and we respect our social tenants\u2019 rights.\u201d On Thursday night, in Camden town hall, a packed meeting organised by Camden council to rally opposition to the housing bill appeared less than convinced by Cameron\u2019s pledge. Opposition is growing in a number of London boroughs with tenants demanding that, if the bill becomes law, councillors should refuse to implement the measures. \u201cThis is our poll tax,\u201d said one speaker. At the meeting, resident after resident rose to speak angrily about the demise of social housing, the takeover of \u201cour city\u201d by \u201cthe rich and the overseas property developers\u201d, and the plight of tenants\u2019 children unable to live in areas where they were born and raised. \u201cKath\u201d came to London in her twenties with post-traumatic stress disorder, escaping a violent partner. Aged 64, she has lived in social housing for 34 years. Her twin daughters, aged 35, live with her. She works full-time and pays \u00a3700 a month in rent. She has never had sufficient money to buy her own home, nor the inclination. She believes in social housing as \u201ca hand up, not a hand out\u201d. When the children were small, she worked three jobs. Now she earns \u00a335,000 in middle management but has a limited pension for when she retires. Her daughters, both law graduates, are in low-paid agency work, but the family income is more than \u00a340,000. Kath says her choice now is either to evict her daughters from her home or substantially reduce her hours, or stop working altogether \u2013 and that would have repercussions on her already small pension when she retires. \u201cMy daughters grew up in Camden, they know people [in the area], and they have friends and connections. Why should they move out?\u201d she says. \u201cWhy should I face life in private rented accommodation, growing progressively less able to pay rent, always on the move, progressively more isolated, when my life is here?\u201d This is \u201cWe Love Council Housing\u201d weekend. On Saturday Kath was out on her estate, putting up posters for a \u201ckill the bill\u201d demonstration on 13 March. A few decades ago, one in three people lived in council housing. Then it developed a stigma that only increases as social housing stock shrinks. Now eight properties are sold for every one built. But Kath says she, like many tenants, value having roots in a genuinely mixed community, the sense of security and belonging that comes from a secure tenancy (also due to be axed), and a family life that embraces the capacity to look out for one another, not least in providing a roof over a son or daughter\u2019s head. Eileen Short, of the campaigning group Defend Council Housing, points out that Aneurin Bevan intended that social housing should mean \u201cthe working man, the doctor and the clergyman will live in close proximity to each other\u201d. Carolyn Gelenter, 58, came from Australia to London in 1990, as a single mother with a young daughter. Her own mother, one of 10 children, had grown up in the East End. Carolyn lived on a tough social housing estate before moving to a two-bedroom flat where she paid social housing rent for 20 years. Six years ago, she downsized to a one-bedroom social housing flat in Bloomsbury, in central London. Carolyn now trains teachers and is a highly skilled speech and language therapist for children with special needs, working across three London boroughs. In recent years her income has risen to \u00a355,000 a year. Carolyn says she happily pays the higher rate of tax. She could have bought her flat 20 years ago, but declined to do so on principle. \u201cA friend bought her flat for half the going rate from the council and recently sold it for a huge profit,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s wrong. \u201cShould I have social housing? I\u2019m incredibly grateful that I\u2019m better off, but I can\u2019t see how else I can afford a place to live. If I\u2019m capped, I can\u2019t pay the rent. Camden will have to sell the flat and a rich property developer will benefit. My alternative is to reduce my days from five to three, but that will impact on my pension and reduce the taxes I pay. \u201cPay to stay \u2013 how does it help anyone that my life gets a whole lot worse and still people in need don\u2019t get properly housed?\u201d In Bermondsey, Susan and Stephen discovered a week ago that, even with a government discount, they are still \u00a330,000 short of enough money to acquire a mortgage on a starter home. \u201cWe started out as cashiers in a supermarket,\u201d Stephen says. \u201cWe might as well go back to that. At least then we could keep our home in a place that we belong. Now it feels as if we\u2019re being punished just because we\u2019ve tried so hard.\u201d Claudia Zylberstzajn, 42 Zylberstzajn, a self-employed mental health social worker, originally from Sierra Leone, moved to London in 1997, eventually settling in Kings Cross, an area that is undergoing major development and is the home of Eurostar and Google, among others. She lives with her husband, a journalist, and their child, paying a social rent of \u00a3700 a month for a two-bedroom house. \u201cWe are the people who kept the area going when it was derelict and scary so that Google could move in,\u201d Zylberstzajn says. \u201cThey should be paying us, not telling us we have to go. I live in an area where I have to travel to buy a latte that I can afford.\u201d The family income is \u00a341,000, taking them over the \u00a340,000 cap. The market rent is \u00a32,200 or more. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with the bill, so we are living with a lot of insecurity and anxiety. \u201cWe are the forgotten people in London. We can\u2019t afford to buy and now they are telling us that we can\u2019t afford to rent. But they need us to work. So, what are we to do?\u201dI\u2019m a Labour voter and I will always be a Labour voter but we are being forced to disappear from London, a Labour city.\u201d John Marais, 69 John is a retired library assistant, living in Cambridge. He worked for Trinity College, dealing at times with rare manuscripts. His wife, Sharon, died seven years ago, aged 50. She earned around \u00a312,000 a year as a clerk. If she had lived, the combination of her salary and John\u2019s pension would have put them above the \u00a330,000 cap. John lives in a two-bedroom house and pays \u00a3420 a month. The market rent is a over \u00a31,000 a month. In 1979, when John and Sharon had a baby on the way, they were allocated a council two-bedroom maisonette, within a month of applying. The council had 14,000 properties. Now that stock has halved, as the city\u2019s population has mushroomed. When pay to stay was announced, a government spokesman said: \u201cIt\u2019s not fair that hard-working people are subsidising the lifestyles of those on higher-than-average incomes, to the tune of \u00a33,500 a year.\u201d John says: \u201cMy council house was built in the 1950s, on council-owned land. The one previous tenant and myself have jointly paid far more in rent than its building cost and only a fraction of my current rent is needed for its management and maintenance, so in what way is my home subsidised?\u201d Pat Turnbull, 68 A retired teacher, Pat has lived on her estate in Hackney for 18 years. She and her partner Mick\u2019s incomes put them just above the \u00a340,000 cap. The couple live with Pat\u2019s 35-year-old son, whose income does not cover rent in the capital. Pat is chair of the tenants\u2019 association on her estate. \u201cI come from a family that has never owned property and I have no ambition to do so,\u201d she says. \u201cMy father was a primary school teacher and he always had a school house. People say if you rent, it\u2019s not your home but that\u2019s not how I see it. It is my home. It\u2019s where I want to stay. But the Housing Bill could make life very, very difficult for us and so many people.\u201d Carolyn Gelenter, 58 Carolyn lived on a housing estate before renting a social housing two-bedroom flat for 20 years; six years ago, she moved to a one-bedroom flat in Bloomsbury, central London. She trains teachers and is a speech therapist for children with special needs. She pays \u00a3650 a month rent while the market rent is \u00a32,000. In recent years, her income has risen to \u00a355,000 a year but she has not saved much because of needing to visit her mother in Australia. On Thursday after the council meeting, she cried. \u201cI suddenly realised I really could end up in a bedsit \u2013 I could lose my home.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
