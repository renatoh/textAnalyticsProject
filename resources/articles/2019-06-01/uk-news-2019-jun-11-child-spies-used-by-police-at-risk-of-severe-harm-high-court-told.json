At a judicial review hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice, campaigners challenging the use of children as covert human intelligence sources (CHISs) argued the lack of safeguards violates children\u2019s human rights and puts them at risk of severe harm. Introducing the case against the Home Office on Tuesday, Caoilfhionn Gallagher QC, acting for Just for Kids Law, told Mr Justice Michael Supperstone that safeguards for children recruited as CHISs were inadequate. \u201cThis case concerns children who may be recruited and deployed as CHIS in the most extreme circumstances,\u201d Gallagher said, referring in particular to one case revealed in a House of Lords debate of a 17-year-old girl recruited to spy on a man who was selling her for sex. Gallagher said: \u201cA justification put forward is that some children are involved in or in close proximity to serious crimes which they could as a covert source help police to investigate and prosecute. \u201cThat justification also demonstrates the acute need for stringent safeguards: keeping a child close to serious crimes may serve a compelling public interest, but it would appear to be antithetical to the child\u2019s own interests.\u201d Seventeen children have been recruited as covert sources since January 2015 \u2013 including one just 15 at the time \u2013 according to figures released by the investigatory powers commissioner in March. The powers under which they are used have existed for nearly two decades, but they came to light only last summer after a House of Lords committee raised the alarm over proposals to make recruitment and deployment easier. Ministers had sought to increase the length of time that child spies could be deployed before re-authorisation from one month to four, and to broaden the range of people who could act as an \u201cappropriate adult\u201d when being interviewed with police. The new rules came into effect shortly after. Just for Kids Law\u2019s judicial review hinges on a claim that the rules governing the use of child spies fail to comply with the home secretary\u2019s obligations to comply with article 8 of the Human Rights Act \u2013 guaranteeing children\u2019s right to a private or family life \u2013 and article 3.1 of the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child \u2013 stipulating that the interests of the child should be a top priority in all decisions and actions that affect them. Gallagher warned that the extension of the length of time a child spy could be authorised had come about for the \u201cadministrative convenience of the authorities concerned.\u201d Because the orders involve covert operations, officers are not required to check with other agencies about vulnerability, histories of domestic abuse or mental health issues of the child spies. \u201cThe decision is made in a very closed circle,\u201d she said. The court heard evidence from Neil Woods, a former police officer who spent years undercover investigating drugs gangs, that such work posed the risk of severe physical and psychological harm to young people. In a written statement read out in court, Woods said he had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his experiences undercover with drugs gangs, which included proximity to extreme violence, including torture and maimings of those considered to be working with police. \u201cI developed the ability to suppress my emotions at times of great stress when I was witnessing very grave things,\u201d Woods said in his statement. \u201cIt causes me great concern that a child could be asked to maintain a lie for any length of time and suffer the psychological harm that I have suffered \u2026 I question the legitimacy in allowing police to recruit child spies at a time when police are just beginning to recognise the lasting harm caused to adults in doing the same thing.\u201d Sir James Eadie QC, responding on behalf of the home secretary, emphasised the many layers of approvals and safeguards involved in recruiting children as CHISs. The hearing lasted one day and Supperstone reserved his judgment, which he will hand down at a later date."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
