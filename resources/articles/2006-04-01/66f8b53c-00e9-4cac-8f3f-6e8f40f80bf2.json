It was not what John Wesley would have called a good death. Fictional deaths rarely are. Authors whose characters depart in peace usually do no more than illustrate the risk of going gently into the literary good night. Piety too easily becomes ridiculous. Helen Burns expired after expressions of sentiments so noble that Jane Eyre could have been left in no doubt that her friend would be at home with the angels. \"I have only a father and he is lately married and will not miss me. By dying I shall escape great suffering. I have not the qualities or talent to make my way very well in the world. I should have been continually at fault.\" The temptation to go all Gothic about death is difficult to resist - even for authors of genius. Baldwin, wandering Weatherfield in the rain, was no more melodramatic than Fanny Robin dying during childbirth in the workhouse, and Far From the Madding Crowd is far less melodramatic than Wuthering Heights. If Baldwin, like Heathcliffe, was to be buried next to his lost love, with one side of his coffin left open for easy access, there would be complaints to the television regulators. We are more comfortable with Michael Henchard, denied the civic funeral due to a former mayor of Casterbridge, being allowed to slip quietly away. \"He's just gone,\" the village ancient reported, \"about half an hour ago, by the sun.\" For all his genius, Charles Dickens was never knowingly understated. He made so much of Little Nell's death that Oscar Wilde claimed that only a man with a heart of stone could read of her passing without laughing. Jo, the Bleak House crossing sweeper, expired in a way that stretches emotions even nearer to breaking point. But the Victorian view of death was not always Grand Guignol. Thackeray knew that the readers of Vanity Fair would prefer restraint. George Osborne's end at Waterloo is encompassed in one sentence. He \"was lying on his face, dead, with a bullet through his heart\". Lord Marchmain, being an aristocrat, went to meet his maker without fuss. Unfortunately, his family made a great deal of it on his behalf. Daughter Julia mistook his death croak for a message from heaven and - in consequence - abandoned her plans to marry Charles Ryder. Brideshead Revisited was intended to illustrate the working of divine grace. It demonstrates the irrationality of belief. Better by far the death of Apthorpe in Men At Arms - speeded on his way by a bottle of whisky smuggled into his hospital ward. Evelyn Waugh's God noticed but did not intervene. He took the same detached view when Baldwin wandered out of hospital. The bald statement guarantees impact. \"Young Bosinney had been run over in the fog and killed.\" Galsworthy left speculation about causes and consequences for later. The brilliance of the brusque account only becomes clear on the last page of The Man of Property. Old Jolyon never wakes from his summer afternoon's sleep. Compare and contrast his peaceful end, the examination paper might demand, with a violent death of the ruined and bereft architect. Neither of them said a dying word about the folly of friendship, the vanity of ambition or the hope of immortality - the theme of second-rate dying soliloquies. Credit to Coronation Street. In death as in life, Baldwin just bragged. Paul Morel killed his mortally sick mother by putting morphine in her late-night milk. No one blames him. Lawrence makes clear the obligation of Sons and Lovers is not constrained by conventional morality. On the other hand, Sophia Baines's neglect of her father - though not directly the cause of his death - establishes her as the irresponsible sister who, according to every Old Wives' Tale, is likely to come to a bad end. In the best fiction, death becomes a metaphor for attitudes to life. That was true of the death in Weatherfield. Baldwin died as he lived, incapable of friendship. It might be argued that to compare a five-times-a-week soap opera with the great novels of the language is so unreasonable that it becomes ridiculous. But that is to deny one welcome fact about last week's Coronation Street. For a couple of episodes, it abandoned its preoccupation with teenage romance and attempted to elbow its way back onto the fringes of traditional English fiction. \u00b7 comment@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
