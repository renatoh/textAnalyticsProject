It seemed the most colossal waste of such a talent, but it also returned me with a strong pang of nostalgia to those years in my early 20s spent floating around a university campus in an Ossie Clark-style dress with no thoughts of job, career or mortgage. Clark was about a careless, romantic, unstructured femininity; life lived in a slightly druggy haze. There was nothing practical, no office life. Ossie Clark was above all about the dress. Three names defined 60s fashion in Britain: Mary Quant, Biba and the boutique Quorum owned by Alice Pollock, which sold the work of Clark and his wife and partner, the pattern-designer Celia Birtwell. You could not be young and alive in the late 60s and early 70s without wearing something that had its origins in the brain and fingers of Ossie Clark, his 30s and 40s-style chiffon dresses, often cut on the bias, in Birtwell's beautiful prints. Clark was an utterly brilliant flash in the pan; he came from nowhere (actually Warrington in Cheshire and later Oswaldtwistle in Lancashire, where he grew up) and his brief place in British fashion lasted less than a decade, from 1966 to 1974, though so decisive an imprint did he make on what we wore, that it seems far longer. We think of the 60s as space-age design, the mini-skirt with Courreges white ankle boots, but in the second half there was a strong influence of earlier times; in Clark's case the eastern kaftan met the 1930s halterneck tea dress. A number of fashion careers hit the skids in the 1970s, such as that of Michael Fish, the menswear designer who came up with the kipper tie, and John Stephen who more or less invented Carnaby Street. With his divorce from Birtwell and his heavy use of drugs, Clark endured a physical decline from which he never recovered; punk killed stone-dead the romantic dress. He was only 54 when he died. So what to make of the announcement on Wednesday that the Ossie Clark label is to be reborn? Marc Worth, founder of WSGN, the retail trends website, has licensed the name from Radley, for whom Clark was doing a bit of designing before he died, and has hired a creative team led by Avsh Alom Gur who has worked at Roberto Cavalli, Chlo\u00e9, Nicole Farhi and Donna Karan. In their studio in Islington on Wednesday morning, the formidable legacy they have to live up to was on display: a rack of Ossie Clark originals, including python hotpants, a cropped leather jacket with rivets unevenly inserted by a member of Pink Floyd, and those landmark long, romantic dresses. Why are you doing it, I asked Marc Worth. Why revive a defunct label so associated with one stellar designer and his own era that the Hockney double portrait of Clark and Birtwell which hangs in the Tate is one of the iconic images of the 60s? \"He had so much potential, and it was unfulfilled,\" Worth says. \"He was one of the most creative talents this country has ever produced, an amazing man who made some beautiful clothes - feminine, effortless, unlimited and relevant. They were fantastic to wear and made the women who wore them feel taller, sexier, freer.\" It is not unknown for labels to come back from the almost dead. Lanvin was still going, but in a dusty kind of way when Alber Elbaz revived it five years ago, yet Ossie Clark was not just a label but the man himself. He said he was a \"master cutter. It's all in my brain and fingers and there's no one in the world to touch me. I can do everything myself.\" Gur, who like Elbaz trained at the Shenkar College of Engineering and Design in Israel, is quiet, sweet and doesn't go to parties. \"I'm a workaholic, a nutter, I've never been a party boy,\" he says. He grew up in the Negev desert, surrounded by Bedouin; his father was a German Holocaust survivor. Fashion has changed, he says. \"It's an industry; you can't live your life the way they did in the 60s. It's mission impossible to take something from the past with all its stories - and politics, which is something I'm not interested in - and bring this into the 21st and even the 22nd century. The shape, cutting on the bias and the use of print, the amazing tailoring and construction, the fit ...\" To measure up to Ossie Clark, he says, is \"a huge challenge\". How, I asked him, did Birtwell, whose career is returning to its own zenith with a recent collection for Topshop, take the news? \"I informed her personally,\" Gur says. \"I opened up my personal studio to her first. I felt an obligation to respect her heritage. The clothes are effortless and beautifully careless, and on the one hand you want to be loyal to the legacy and on the other hand you want to move forward.\" You only have to look at the originals to see how small they were. An Ossie Clark size 12 now fits a size 4 model, and his size 10 is size 0. Girls were smaller-boned, they didn't have the kind of lives we have now. Some of Clark's best-known fabrics, such as the moss crepe, don't work for today, Gur says; they're too heavy and hot. The new label plans to launch at London Fashion Week in February. As yet, there is just a collection of toiles to show, and what kind of launch it will be remains mysterious. It will not be a catwalk show, they say, but there will be live models. The new dresses will cost about \u00a3400. Revivals are a risk. They depend on the talent of the designer, the finances of the backers, and whether the name alone will bring customers who weren't even born when Clark was designing. But the most recent round of catwalk shows suggest that spring/summer 2008 will be a season of romantic chiffon dresses. That's the kind of luck that Clark himself finally ran out of."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
