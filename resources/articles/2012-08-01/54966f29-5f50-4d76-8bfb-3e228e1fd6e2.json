However the suspicion after an action-packed first day at the old Racecourse is that against Essex, they may be hoist by their own petard. David Masters and Graham Napier had already done their bit to frustrate the Peakites by making the top two individual scores as Essex recovered from 113 for five to a defendable total, sharing an eighth-wicket stand of 74 that was comfortably the highest of the innings. Then they combined again with the new ball in the evening sunshine, Masters plucking out two of Derbyshire's top three before Napier weighed in with the wicket of nightwatchman Tony Palladino \u2013 for whom this was a frustrating day against his old county. Palladino had opened up with 48 Championship wickets, having shown for the second consecutive season that he is a fine county cricketer, even if he is destined to be remembered far more widely as the whistleblower most responsible for the exposure of Danish Kaneria, and the jailing of his former team-mate Mervyn Westfield. He quickly moved to 49 by having Jaik Mickleburgh caught behind in his third over, but was unable to add to that wicket in the remainder of the innings. Mark Turner, a skiddy seamer who has had previous stints with Derbyshire and Somerset, and signed a new two-year contract with Derbyshire during the lunch interval, seemed to beat both Owais Shah and Adam Wheater for pace, and the former Yorkshire left arm spinner David Wainwright continued his excellent first season in the Midlands by exploiting the dampness in the pitch to end with four for 64. Essex may yet pay in what seems likely to be a low-scoring game for gifting two of their wickets, the captain James Foster running himself out when apparently well set by going for a non-existent single to mid-on, and Masters last out for 35 seeking an equally ambitious second. But Masters, the angular 34-year-old who took a staggering 93 Championship wickets last season, always seemed likely to prove a handful on this pitch, and so it proved as Wayne Madsen was bowled and the Australian left-hander Usman Khawaja brilliantly snapped up at second slip by Tom Westley. The way Essex celebrated suggested that they still fancy their chances of making a late run to snatch promotion either with, or at the expense of, Derbyshire."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
