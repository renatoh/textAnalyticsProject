Video footage of one of the stranded cocklers, filmed from a rescue helicopter in February last year, was shown to the jury. Li Hua, who had only been in the UK for a few days, desperately waved his arms. He was rescued by a lifeboat and was the only survivor pulled from the sea. An alleged gangmaster, Lin Liang Ren, 29, of Liverpool, is accused of 21 counts of manslaughter, which he denies. Some cocklers managed to struggle to shore when they realised the water was rising, the jury was told. Tim Holroyde, prosecuting, said: \"It seems that one group went in one direction and was able to make it back to safety; the others took a different direction and drowned.\" One, Weng Zhang Yu, found his way to the gangmaster's minibus but was ordered out by Lin Liang Ren. \"That refusal of assistance to a man who had narrowly escaped drowning is, we suggest, something you will want to keep in mind,\" he said. Lin Liang Ren was picked up by police walking on the A6. At the police station, with his girlfriend, Zhao Xiao Qing, at his side, he told survivors what to say. \"They were to name one of those who drowned as being the boss,\" Mr Holroyde said. David Eden, 62, and his son David Anthony Eden, 34, owners of the Liverpool Bay Fishing Company, are accused of conspiring to facilitate breaches of immigration law, which they deny. Lin Liang Ren and Zhao Xiao Qing, 20, are also accused of facilitation along with Lin Mu Yong. Today the jurors visit the bay."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
