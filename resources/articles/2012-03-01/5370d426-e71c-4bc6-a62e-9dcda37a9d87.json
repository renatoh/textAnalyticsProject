On Wednesday the New York Civil Liberties Union, LatinoJustice PRLDEF and The Bronx Defenders set their sights on Operation Clean Halls, an element of the department's stop-and-frisk program that allows police officers to conduct patrols inside thousands of residential buildings throughout the city. Filed on behalf of 13 black and Latino New Yorkers and a class of similarly situated individuals, the suit accuses the NYPD of systematically violating the constitutional rights of hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers. The suit is the third major legal challenge to the department's stop-and-frisk program in the last five years. The plaintiffs include several mothers and their teenage children. They claim the program regularly leads to unwarranted stops, harrassment and trespassing arrests in the their own buildings and the buildings of their friends and family. Residents say the frequency of police stops has caused loved ones to stop visiting and has left them feeling isolated and fearful, as though they are living under siege. They claim that they are afraid to leave their homes \u2013 even on simple errands \u2013 without identification because an encounter with a police officer in their building could lead to an arrest. \"You can be sitting outside enjoying a nice day and the officers will come up and ask you for your ID,\" Jacqueline Yates, a Bronx mother of two explained. \"It makes you emotional just standing here talking about it,\" Yates said, as she fought back tears at Wednesday's press conference announcing the suit. \"You get to the point where you don't feel like a human being.\" \"I got family members that don't send their kids over because they're scared they're going to be stopped,\" Yates went on to say. \"The point is, I want the police to do their job. It's just how they're going about doing it, because right now I don't feel safe. I don't feel safe for my kids.\" According to the lawsuit, Operation Clean Halls has existed since 1991 and is intended to combat criminal activity in the city's high-crime areas. The program allows private property owners to fill out a form granting the police the right to enter their buildings and arrest anyone inside who is engaged in criminal activity. In the Bronx, Clean Halls agreements have reportedly authorized police to enter enrolled buildings \"into perpetuity\". According to the suit, there are at least 3,895 Clean Halls buildings in Manhattan alone and in the Bronx \"virtually every private apartment building is enrolled in the program\". When asked for comment on the suit, NYPD deputy commissioner Paul Browne wrote to the Guardian to say, \"By challenging uninvited individuals, police are providing a level of safety to tenants that residents of doormen buildings take for granted.\" Browne added: \"The year before Clean Halls started was 1990. There were 710,221 index crimes in 1990. There were 2,245 murders in 1990. In 2011 there were 106,530 index crimes. There were 504 homicides. 1990 was an all time high in homicides. If we maintained that rate we would have 30,000 more people murdered since 1990.\" NYPD data indicates that between 2006 and 2010, the department made 329,446 stops based on suspicion of trespassing, representing 12% of all stops. Out the total number of stops 7.5% have led to arrests. In 2010 the 10 precincts with the most arrests accounted for nearly as many stops as the remaining 66 precincts combined. The significant number of stops in comparison to the low-level of arrests \u2013 and their prevalence in black and Latino communities \u2013 reflect patterns in the NYPD's street-level stop-and-frisk program. Last year the department broke its own record by stopping and questioning nearly 700,000 people, an increase of over 600% since the program began in 2002. Of those stopped in 2011, 87% were African American or Latino. \"In many Clean Halls buildings, NYPD officers demand identification from almost everyone they encounter,\" Alexis Karteron, the NYCLU's lead attorney on the case explained. \"Residents feel like they cannot leave their apartments without ID for any reason or else they may be arrested on trumped up charges of trespassing.\" Karteron said visitors to Clean Halls residences are often arrested because their IDs do not match the address of the building. \"In certain Clean Halls buildings there is simply no such thing as having a friend come by for an unannounced visit. If you stop by, hoping to catch a friend or relative, there is a very good chance that you will be arrested,\" Karteron added. A 17-year-old Bronx resident named Angel, a plaintiff in the suit who could not give his last name due to his age, says he was subjected to one such arrest. Angel claims he was visiting a friend at his apartment building in Queens in February 2011 when police officers stopped him and two other friends on the sidewalk. The officers allegedly accused the three of trespassing, despite Angel telling them that he had just left his friend's apartment. As one officer left to check their story with the apartment's residents, the three were reportedly told they would be arrested. Upon returning an officer told the young men that nobody was home at the apartment. When Angel described the people in the apartment, the officer reportedly changed his story and said a man in the apartment told him nobody had recently left. When Angel asked why he and his friends were being arrested, the officer allegedly pointed to an Operation Clean Halls sign on the building and said, \"You can't fucking read that sign?\" The three were arrested on charges that were ultimately dropped. Angel had once considered a career as police officer but says the ordeal changed his mind. He believes the police cause fear through Operation Clean Halls. \"To know that there's cops around, you're supposed to feel safe,\" Angel told the Guardian. \"But now when you're walking to your house, and you're not looking back behind your back to see if somebody is going to rob or steal from you, you're looking for a cop. How you live like that? \"You gotta find the key quicker than they can find the key to the building,\" Angel explained. \"If they get there before you they're going to stop you.\" \"I got family members that don't send their kids over because they're scared they're going to be stopped,\" Yates went on to say. \"The point is, I want the police to do their job. It's just how they're going about doing it, because right now I don't feel safe. I don't feel safe for my kids.\" Fawn Bracy, another Bronx mother, expressed similar concerns. \"I can't count the number of times I've watched police throw my son and his friends up against a wall,\" Bracy explained. \"Anywhere my son goes \u2013 the lobby, the courtyard, the stairwell \u2013 he can be stopped and harassed by NYPD. A trip to the store can result in a weekend in jail for him.\" Bracy, too, said Operation Clean Halls has affected her relationship to extended family. \"My family, which is my sister and nephew, they would come over every weekend to visit us. My sister don't allow him to come see us anymore, nor she comes to visit me anymore,\" Bracy added. \"It's been over a year now.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
