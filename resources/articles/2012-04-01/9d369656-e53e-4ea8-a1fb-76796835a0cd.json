The track I think has been unfairly slept on this year GummiHz: Secret Voyage This is such a beautiful, deep, percussive tune that didn't get much love outside a few heads. The track I'd play at my auntie's wedding Chaka Khan: I Know You, I Live You Her influence can be heard in so much modern music, but nothing can touch her original records. They're loved by many different generations and I could see my folks reliving their own special moments with their hands in the air to this. The track that got me out of bed this morning Eberhard Weber: Quiet Departures A serene masterpiece. Totally inspirational. The best track by my favourite new artist Sarp Yilmaz: Discover Me Yilmaz is a relatively undiscovered artist from Istanbul who brings together elements from underground jazz and house in a soulful and accessible way. Discover Me is warm, engaging and a fantastic listen from start to finish. The track I'd play to show off my eclectic tastes Don Cherry: Brown Rice A record I have loved for pretty much my entire life, from early childhood up until the present day. Don Cherry lived all over the world and is someone I have a huge amount of respect for. The track I'd play at sunset in Ibiza Miguel Migs Feat Meshell Ndegeocello: Close Your Eyes (Yoruba Soul Mix) This has got everything you'd need to fully appreciate the beauty of an Ibizan sunset: deep bass, hypnotic keys and a dreamy vocal courtesy of Meshell. The track that should have been a crossover hit Osunlade: Ser Al Santisimo I'm presuming the only thing that stopped this crossing over was the fact that it was never actually released as a single! Maybe it's time it officially saw the light of day \u2026 The track I want played at my funeral Jon Hassell: Empire III Calming and stirring in equal measure. I think this would be a fitting soundtrack for my earthly send off. Osunlade plays the Ministry Of Sound, SE1, Sat; Osunlade In The House is out now on Defected"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
