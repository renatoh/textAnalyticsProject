Corrections published in the Guardian on 14 May 2010 \u2022\u2008Our story headlined More than 100 dead as Libyan jet crashes (13 May, page 27) quoted an airline expert as saying that Tripoli's airport is \"not equipped with navigational aids \u2013 it does have ILS [instrument landing system]\". However, a crucial negative had gone missing in the second part of that sentence, which should have read \"it doesn't have ILS\". \u2022\u2008An interview with Joanna Newsom was mistaken when it stated that the singer and harpist had an operation in 2009 to remove nodules from her vocal cords. Elsewhere in the article, an editing change meant that Ruth Crawford Seeger was referred to as Ruth Seeger. She should also have been described as a modernist composer rather than a minimalist one ('Is it time for a glass of wine?', 10 May, page 17, G2) \u2022\u2008Bradley Wiggins won the prologue time trial in the Giro d'Italia, a cycling report said, adding that this made him the first Briton to wear the pink leader's jersey in the Giro. Actually, he was the second; a reader notes that Mark Cavendish was the first, in the early stages of the 2009 race (Independent review scrutinises Team Sky link to Olympic squad, 10 May, page 13, Sport). \u2022\u2008A change made during the editing process left a television review saying that Henri Matisse built a chapel in Venice, when the place was Vence (A Matisse window moved Alastair Sooke to tears. They're a sensitive lot, these arty types, 10 May, page 25, G2)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
