The bomb, made of explosives packed into a car, exploded in the town of Parachinar, in the Kurram region on the Afghan border. The blast occurred as supporters of an independent candidate who is backed by the party of assassinated politician Benazir Bhutto were returning to his office after a rally, witnesses said. 'Twenty-seven deaths have been confirmed and 90 people were wounded,' said Fida Mohammad, a senior government official in Parachinar. The Interior Ministry said it believed the death toll was in fact 37. Kurram is part of the semi-autonomous tribal zones where the Pakistani army have been fighting against militants and international Islamic extremists. With the death toll in Pakistan now standing at nearly 80 in the last week alone, there are fears of widespread violence as the country of 170 million goes to the polls. Police in the southern city of Hyderabad said they had foiled a similar attack targeting polling booths on Monday, the day of the vote. Authorities also announced the arrest of 10 \"militants\" in the port city of Karachi. The election, postponed after former Bhutto was killed in a gun and suicide bomb attack on December 27, has been overshadowed by violence. \"I am scared to vote but Bhutto remains in our hearts,\" said Ishfaq Ali, a pharmaceutical representative in the western city of Lahore yesterday. \"I want to do my democratic duty to her memory.\" The polls are supposed to complete the return of Pakistan to complete civilian rule eight years after General Pervez Musharraf seized power in a bloodless coup but there are deep concerns about vote rigging by the government. However the turn out is still expected to be relatively high. \"A fair election is absolutely crucial for the future constitutional development of the country,\" said Osama Siddique, a professor in law and policy at Lahore University. The poll could cause serious problems for President Musharraf - a key US ally who stepped down as army chief in November - if voters elect a parliament hostile to him. Ordinary Pakistanis are concerned about rising prices of basic commodities such as wheat flour and evermore frequent power cuts. However, none of the main parties are expected to secure a majority so a coalition is likely. The two main opposition leaders, Nawaz Sharif and Bhutto's widower, Asif Ali Zardari, met in a suburb of Lahore yesterday. \"If the opposition is deprived of its rightful place in the elections, I think that will be very dangerous ... It will throw the country into very chaotic situation,' Sharif told reporters afterwards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
