Merrill Lynch, the company's investment banking adviser, has indicated that windfall payouts are likely to be between \u00a3450 and \u00a3540, which will be paid to about 1.7 million qualifying members. However, more than 60% of these will receive an additional allocation of shares, which will depend on the size of their policy and how long they have held it UK members and customers of Friends Provident will be able to buy shares in this offer on preferential terms. This will be in addition to the allocation of shares to qualifying members. David Newbigging, chairman of Friends Provident, is encouraging members to vote for the proposal, saying: \"This is an important milestone in the development of the Friends Provident Group. The distribution of shares to qualifying members will release value to them without any adverse impact on their policies.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
