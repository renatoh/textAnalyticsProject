Who's going to care about prize-winning coursework in the midst of global meltdown? So even if you've got an important seminar coming up, it's worth devoting the odd spare moment to saving the planet. A lot of being green is easy, because it's about not doing things. Don't buy plastic bottles of water - or anything else you don't need. Don't overfill the kettle. Don't live off packaging-heavy ready meals and takeaways, or cook mountains of pasta you never eat. You should also cut down on the amount of washing you do. Don't wash your clothes too often, and you can certainly forget ironing them - wrinkles are a badge of energy-saving honour. In any case, you'll be covering up with jumpers to limit your use of central heating. Don't wash up dishes under a running tap either, or wash up just the odd plate at a time. That towering, festering pile of crockery in the corner represents a chance to save hot water and washing-up liquid as well as to negotiate community relations. Nor should you take too many baths. Have a shower instead - and don't linger too long. If you must have a bath, reuse your flatmate's bathwater, and use it again to water the garden. This is called using grey water, or, for some groups of flatmates, black water. Depending on how closely you follow these principles, you may feel your home needs air freshener. Resist the temptation to buy commercial sprays, instead favour natural oils or scented candles. There are times, too, when washing is the more environmentally friendly option. Throwing away dirty dishcloths or tops that say \"handwash only\" just because you can't face all those rinses and washing instructions will not boost your green brownie points. Next, stop buying new clothes and books. Buy them second-hand, or borrow, and don't print out anything unless you absolutely have to. If you do, print on both sides of recycled paper. This doesn't mean giving up consumerism altogether. Energy-saving lightbulbs, recycled notebooks and pens, hemp clothes, organic cotton sheets and silk-filled duvets are all both green and reassuringly expensive. There are some other positive steps you can take, too, such as putting a Hippo, brick, or plastic bottle full of water in the cistern to save on water, and turning down the thermostat a notch. Then there's composting, which does take a bit more effort than failing to clear out the vegetable tray at the bottom of the fridge. Environmental services departments at some local councils give advice on how to compost, and may even supply compost bins or wormeries. On a larger scale, you can volunteer for a local conservation project or join a pressure group such as People &amp; Planet, which runs student campaigns. You can also find out about what your university is doing to combat climate change, and lobby for it to go for Fairtrade status. After all, while individual actions are important, it's only really the big companies with global reach that can make a significant difference. Which can be a comforting thought for anyone planning a round-the-world trip over the summer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
