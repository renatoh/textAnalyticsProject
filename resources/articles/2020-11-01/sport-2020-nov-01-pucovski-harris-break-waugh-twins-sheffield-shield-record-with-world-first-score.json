Victoria\u2019s opening pair On Sunday morning overtook the 464-run stand made by the Australian Test team twins for NSW against Western Australia back in 1990. The feat was achieved at Adelaide\u2019s ACH Group Stadium against South Australia when Harris crashed a boundary off the bowling of Wes Agar. Harris (239) was ultimately out caught behind by Harry Nielsen off the bowling of Agar (1-113) to leave their mark at 486, the highest Australian first-class partnership since the competition started in 1892. It is also the first time any first-class partnership in the world has scored exactly 486. Pucovski has declared himself available for Test selection after the prodigious 22-year-old removed himself from the team last year for mental health reasons, before a concussion ruled him out for the season. It is also a good sign for Harris, who was dropped after last year\u2019s Ashes tour and told by national selectors to show a more ruthless side at Sheffield Shield level. Pucovski spoke of his Test aspirations earlier this week. \u201cI don\u2019t have much control over whether they pick me or not, but I\u2019m definitely very keen,\u201d Pucovski said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a dream of mine since I can remember. From that perspective I\u2019m definitely very keen to hopefully put my best foot forward. But it\u2019s out of my control, so I\u2019ll just be focusing on what I can control.\u201d South Australia had a chance to prevent the record on Sunday morning when Callum Ferguson dropped a simple chance from Harris at slip with the score at 0-436. Victoria eventually declared only for SA\u2019s horror show to continue, Scott Boland (2-18) removing Conor McInerney (2) and Brad Davis (4) to have the home side 2-10.\\ Test middle order batsman Travis Head (49 no) then hunkered down with Henry Hunt (17 no), the former likely needing another huge innings to salvage the match for SA."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
