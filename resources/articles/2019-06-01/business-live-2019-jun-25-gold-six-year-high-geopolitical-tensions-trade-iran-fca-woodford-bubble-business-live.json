Britain\u2019s stock market has ended the day where it began, with the FTSE 100 up just 5 points. European stock markets posted losses, with Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB shedding 0.75% and Spain losing 1%. Gold is still up today, at $1,427 per ounce - near the six-year high of $1,438 struck this morning. David Madden of CMC Markets sums up the day: It was been a lacklustre session in Europe today as the US-Iran, and the US-China tensions continue to circulate. The G20 summit is at the forefront of traders\u2019 minds and the meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping is likely to determine the next major move in equities. Some traders are sitting on their hands until the meeting between the two leaders is out of the way. Goodnight! GW Americans are less upbeat about the economy -- something which may alarm the White House ahead of next year\u2019s elections. Bloomberg has the details: U.S. consumer confidence fell in June to the lowest level since September 2017 as Americans became less upbeat about the economy and labor market amid trade tensions with China and Mexico. The Conference Board\u2019s index declined to 121.5, lower than all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey, data from the New York-based group showed Tuesday. A gauge of the present situation decreased to a one-year low of 162.6, while the measure of expectations fell to 94.1. President Trump has just hit back against Iran\u2019s claim that his new sanctions are \u201cmentally retarded\u201d. Trump is threatening to \u2018obliterate\u2019 parts of the country if Iranian forces attack America, which may make investors more anxious about geopolitical tensions. Despite today\u2019s losses, Wall Street is still on track for its best June since 1938. President Trump has awarded himself a pat on the back: He should really be thanking Mr Jerome Powell, though - the Fed chair sparked the rally by hinting that interest rates will be cut next month. Hello again. Wall Street has opened in the red, as geopolitical tensions worry investors. The Dow Jones industrial average has shed 108 points, or 0.4%, to 26,628 points. The broader S&amp;P 500, which hit a record high last week, has also dipped, by around 0.25%. Traders are cautious ahead of the G20 world leaders meeting this week, anxious that Donald Trump and Xi Jinping may not secure a trade war ceasefire. Analysts at USB had added to the jitters, forecasting a 20% stock market plunge if talks break down.... Speaking of cars..... the UK auto industry has sounded another warning against a no-deal Brexit. The SMMT has repeated its claim that car prices will go up by an average of \u00a31,500 if Britain left the EU without a withdrawal agreement. It also fears that a hard border would push up costs by up to \u00a350,000 every minute! That\u2019s because the delicate just-in-time production systems, and complicated cross-border supply chains, would become gummed up. Here\u2019s the full story: Britons also cut back on new car purchases this month. That suggests people are being cautious about making big-ticket spending decisions. The CBI says: 10% of motor traders reported sales volumes were up on a year ago, whilst 51% said they were down, giving a balance of -41%. Volumes are expected to be broadly flat next month (-3%). The FT blames Britain\u2019s poor summer for the decline in shopping. UK retail sales were hit by unseasonably cold weather in May and the trend seems to have continued in June, according to a closely watched survey. The CBI survey registered a retail sales balance of minus 42 per cent, after 16 per cent of the retailers surveyed said sales volumes were up on a year below in June, while 58 per cent said they were down. The balance was the lowest since the financial crisis and worse than markets expected. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take on the decline in UK retail sales this month: British retail sales plunged this month at the fastest annual pace in 10 years, in part reflecting a surge in sales in June last year which were spurred by hot weather and the men\u2019s soccer World Cup, a survey showed on Tuesday. The Confederation of British Industry\u2019s monthly retail sales balance fell to -42 from -27 in May, below all forecasts in a Reuters poll that had pointed to an improved reading of -10. \u201cThis month\u2019s drop in sales should be taken with a pinch of salt, given the backdrop of last June\u2019s heatwave and the start of the World Cup,\u201d CBI economist Alpesh Paleja said. \u201cBut even accounting for both factors, underlying conditions on the High Street remain challenging.\u201d The CBI found that grocers were the largest contributors to the fall in sales volumes. That backs up the idea that Britons spent more on food and drink a year ago, as they picnicked in the sun or held World Cup parties. Hardware &amp; DIY stores also posted declines -- perhaps it was just too wet to buy a new barbeque or ourdoor decking. Andy Bruce of Reuters isn\u2019t convinced that this month\u2019s slump in retail sales can be disregarded, just because June 2018 was so rosy. Economics professor Danny Blanchflower reckons Brexit uncertainty is hurting the high street: That column will be online shortly.... Worryingly, many UK retailers are pessimistic about their prospects in July, and are cutting back on orders. Here are the key points from the CBI\u2019s gloomy assessment of UK retailing: 16% of retailers said that sales volumes were up in June on a year ago, whilst 58% said they were down, giving a weighted balance of -42%. 16% of respondents expect sales volumes to increase next month, whilst 27% expect a decrease, giving a balance of -11% 15% of retailers placed more orders with suppliers than they did a year ago, whilst 48% placed fewer orders, giving a balance of -33%. 26% of retailers reported that their volume of sales for the time of year were good, whilst 45% said they were poor, giving a balance of -19% Internet sales were broadly flat on a year ago (+3%), following growth in the previous month (+38%). Internet sales growth is expected to pick up in the year to July (+23%), but remain weaker than the long-run average (+46%) Economists are disappointed by the slump in retail sales this month: British retail sales plunged this month at the fastest annual pace in 10 years, as wet weather hurt the high street. The CBI\u2019s monthly retail sales balance (which asks firms if sales were up, or down compared to a year ago) has plunged to -42 from -27 in May, dashing hopes of a rise to -10. That sounds pretty alarming. However, the CBI points out that June 2018 was particularly warm - encouraging people to a) buy summer clothes and furniture, and b) splash out on food and drink as they enjoyd the Men\u2019s football world cup. CBI chief economist Alpesh Paleja says we shouldn\u2019t panic: This month\u2019s drop in sales should be taken with a pinch of salt, given the backdrop of last June\u2019s heatwave and the start of the World Cup. But even accounting for both factors, underlying conditions on the High Street remain challenging. Retailers are having to continually compete for the attention of value-conscious shoppers, in the age of digital disruption. \u201cThe new Prime Minister must help support retailers by reducing the high cumulative burden of costs they face. This should start by urgently reviewing the dire business rates system, which is unfairly impacting UK high streets and deterring much needed investment.\u201d Of course, this year has brought the Women\u2019s World Cup, and the Cricket one, so we\u2019re not being starved of sport. However, the weather certainly hasn\u2019t been as good as last year. It\u2019s time to break away from parliament, as some alarmingly weak UK retail sales figures just landed! More to follow! Q: Shouldn\u2019t Neil Woodford be forced to stop drawing management fees, having blocked investors from taking their money out. FCA chair Andrew Bailey says it would be \u201ca good thing\u201d if Woodford stopped claiming these fees, although on the other hand Woodford is managing the fund more than ever! Bailey adds that the regulator will also probe Hargreaves Lansdown over the fee reductions it negotiates on its favourite funds. Those savings are passed onto customers, but there are still concerns that they distort the market. Q: Is the Woodford crisis a failure of rules, or a failure of regulation? It\u2019s a failure of rules, says top regulator Andrew Bailey firmly (and not at all biasedly). Q: So the rules need changing? Yes. Q: Will Brexit allow the FCA to shake off its current EU rules-based, \u2018tick-box\u2019, regulation and focus more on principles (as Bailey alluded to) FCA chair Charles Randall takes this point sympathetically. A freer hand will allow the FCA to look more at outcomes, he says. Randall also explains that the FCA (set up a decade ago) is still trying to improve. His personal view is that the first period of the FCA\u2019s existence was dominated by misconduct problems from the financial crisis. It is now trying to become a more outward-looking regulator, Randall adds. Nicky Morgan MP is concerned by the idea that the FCA could slacken off on rules -- many of which were brought in after the financail crisis. Q: How aware will someone like Neil Woodford be of \u2018principles\u2019, unless the FCA shows it is watching closely? Bailey says this is a very fair point, but adds that companies can hide behind the rules book when things go wrong. Q: What about Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s role in the Woodford crisis? Andrew Bailey says the FCA is pursuing Hargreaves over its Wealth 50 list of \u2018favourite\u2019 funds. Were they too slow to take Woodford\u2019s fund off the list, he asks? Some early reaction to the FCA/Woodford hearing: Andrew Bailey also concedes that the Woodford fund would have been suspended sooner if the UK used a \u201cprinciples based system\u201d, not simply a rules-based one. But he denies that suspending the fund is a bad result -- it\u2019s better than a firesale of assets. This fund has to manage the shrinkage. Q: The Woodford Equity Income fund was worth \u00a310bn at its peak - what\u2019s it worth today? Between \u00a33.5bn and \u00a34bn, Bailey replies. Q: Is that due to redemptions, or poor performance? Mostly redemptions. Q: But isn\u2019t this fund basically a dog? Bailey points out that Neil Woodford\u2019s career has seen periods of poor performance, and period of strong outperformance - that\u2019s how he built his following. The Treasury committee are now criticising Andrew Bailey for not moving faster when Neil Woodford tried to list some of his illiquid holdings on the Guernsey Stock Exchange. Bailey says that Guernsey did call the FCA, but the call somehow went astray. A second call, on 26 April, led to a meeting in May. Bailey disputes Guernsey\u2019s claim that they only discussed the situation in early June (around the time Woodford froze his fund). He claims the FCA thought it was fully briefed on 8 May. Committee chairman Nicky Morgan isn\u2019t impressed, saying the FCA should simply be more proactive in monitoring the markets and protecting consumers. Q: Does anyone at the FCA actually read the newspapers? Yes, Bailey replies defensively. Q: So why didn\u2019t you spot that the media were worried about Woodford? Bailey says a Citywire article triggered the FCA\u2019s concerns about Woodford. Over in parliament, the Treasury Committee have begun their session on \u201cThe work of the Financial Conduct Authority\u201d. In the hot seats - CEO Andrew Bailey and chairman Charles Randell. It\u2019s being streamed online here. MPs start by asking the FCA about fund manager\u2019s Neil Woodford\u2019s suspended Equity Income fund, which has locked hundreds of thousands of investors out. Q: The FCA were first informed that Woodford had breached the 10% limit on illiquid assets in 2017 - so why was the problem not tackled? Bailey says the FCA put Woodford into an enhanced liquidity monitoring system the second time this rule was breached - a a rare move. This meant the FCA was aware that customers had started pulling money out in recent months. Q: But shouldn\u2019t you have asked more questions about the time it would take to sell assets to cover redemptions? Bailey says the FCA was monitoring the pace of outflows vs Woodford\u2019s sales of assets (to pay for those redemptions). Those outflows \u201clooked manageable\u201d, the FCA chief says. He then reveals that the FCA pushed Woodford to find an independent valuer of its various assets. Bailey says the FCA \u201cwasn\u2019t comfortable\u201d about the role played by Link Fund Solutions -- Woodford\u2019s authorised corporate director who was meant to value assets that weren\u2019t listed on stock markets (and were thus hard to sell quickly - a key reason Woodford couldn\u2019t keep up with customer demands for their money back). An update on the Southern Water scandal -- the company now faces prosecution by the Environment Agency, on top of today\u2019s \u00a3126m penalty for \u201cshocking\u201d failures at its sewage treatment sites. Southern\u2019s CEO Ian McAulay, who joined in 2017, admitted on the BBC Today Programme that it is \u201cperfectly reasonable to say there was dishonesty\u201d before he joined, in the way the company manipulated its wastewater sampling process and misreported sewage treatment site performance. Analyst Michael Brown of Caxton FX says the markets are in a risk-off mood today: As you can see from this chart, gold has surged dramatically this month to this morning\u2019s six-year highs. At $1,430-ish/ounce, gold is still someway shy of its record high of around $1,900 set in 2011. Back then, traders reckoned that record low interest rates and quantitative easing would drive inflation up, making gold a good way to preserve capital. Han Tan, Market Analyst at FXTM, reckons gold has more upside: Gold\u2019s lure has only increased amid intensified fears over the global growth outlook that has been severely dampened by US-China trade tensions that have lasted for nearly a year. The now enlarged scope of the US-China conflict, expanding beyond trade to include the tech sector, along with the displays of brinksmanship that have unfolded in recent weeks, creates a narrative that should keep Gold\u2019s allure intact. Back in the UK, utility provider Southern Water has been slapped with a record-breaking \u00a3126m fine, for some shocking failures at its sewage treatment sites. Southern has apologised, after the regulator found it failed to operate a number of sewage treatment works properly, including not making the necessary investment, which led to equipment failures and spills of wastewater. Campaigners for the re-nationalisation of public services say the sorry episode shows private companies can\u2019t be trusted with such vital tasks. Analyst Naeem Aslam of Think Markets is confident that gold will keep climbing. He thinks it could soon hit $1,550 per ounce, up more than another hundred dollars. Why? The tensions between the US and Iran are one factor, as is the weaker US dollar (which pushes up the cost of commodities priced in $). But there\u2019s another reason. The boom in bond prices means more debt is only offering a negative yield (ie, you actually lose money by holding the bond until it matures). In that environment, gold looks more attractive. Aslam writes: An important factor which investors should be paying attention to is the correlation between the gold price and the size of the negative-yield debt. The chart below shows that there is a strong correlation which means that the gold price rises as the size of the negative yield debt increases. This makes perfect sense, of course, no one likes to have negative yield debt. The safer bet is the shining metal. Given the current monetary policy adopted by the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve bank, it is likely that the gold price may actually touch $1550 in the next few months. Gold actually got as high as $1,438/ounce in choppy overnight trading (highest since May 2013), before settling around $1,430 now. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says a \u201cperfect blend of supporting factors\u201d is responsible for its surge. Four things are really driving gold \u2013 falling yields, a weaker dollar, a soft macroeconomic outlook and geopolitical risks rising in the Middle East. Gold has risen to $1,430, as Iran\u2019s president launches a broadside at Donald Trump. President Rouhani, in a TV speech, declared that America\u2019s new financial sanctions on top Iranians will fail. He also insisted that the restrictions on supreme leader Khamenei will fail, as he doesn\u2019t own any foreign assets anyway. Dubbing the White House \u201cretarded\u201d, Rouhini also accuses the US of lying about seeking talks with Tehran. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index of leading blue-chip shares has fallen 40 points at the start of trading, down 0.5% to 7,375 points. Other European markets are also dipping, following the losses in Asia overnight. This has pulled the EU-wide Stoxx 600 index down by 0.4%. Precious metals miners are bucking the trend, though. Fresnillo (Mexico\u2019s largest gold producer) is up 1% in London. Bitcoin is also rallying today --- up another 2% to $11,267, a 15-month high. While gold climbs, Asian stocks are ending the day in the red. After a weak session, China\u2019s CSI 300 stock index has closed down 1%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng shed 1.3% while Japan\u2019s Nikkei dipped by 0.4%. Gold\u2019s rally shows no signs of stopping, reports Bloomberg, thanks to geopolitical issues around the globe. It says: Bullion\u2019s been on a tear this month as the dollar weakened after the Fed opened the door to an interest rate cut and other central banks also pivoted to a more dovish stance. Investors are taking note -- pouring into exchange-traded funds backed by the precious metal and boosting net long positions in U.S. gold futures and options. Morgan Stanley said gold is its top commodity pick on a six-month view as the uncertain macroeconomic outlook adds to its appeal. \u201cThe global capital market\u2019s mood is shaky due to the fear of the unknowns and it\u2019s this uncertainty that will continue to provide the jet fuel for an already high-octane gold market,\u201d Stephen Innes, managing partner at Vanguard Markets Pte, said in a note. The gold price has jumped by over 10% this month, rising from $1,288/ounce at the end of May to $1,426 this morning. Alfonso Esparza, a senior market analyst at OANDA, believes bullion could surge higher, if the US and China can\u2019t reach a trade deal at the G20 meeting. He writes: \u201cThe main event this week will be the sidebar meeting between Trump and Xi, which could stop the current gold rally with a productive sit-down that ends up in a trade agreement,\u201d \u201cThe flip side could boost gold prices even further as the Trump administration has shown that it could turn from friendly to aggressive in a heartbeat further fuelling investor\u2019s demand for a safe haven.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Jitters over the US-China trade war and tensions in the Middle East continue to buffet markets. Overnight, Iran has hit back at America\u2019s decision to impose new sanctions on its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, saying it has slammed the door of diplomacy shut. So, with president Trump accusing Iran of \u201cincreasingly provocative actions\u201d, the threat of military action in the Gulf hasn\u2019t gone away. Most Asian stock markets have dipped overnight, and we\u2019re expecting a weaker start in Europe too. Investors have one eye on the Middle East, and another on the upcoming G20 meeting of world leaders in Japan. The markets would like to see Trump cut a ceasefire deal with president Xi. But China isn\u2019t rolling over; yesterday, Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said both sides need to compromise. Hawkish US officials aren\u2019t in the mood to compromise on issues like forced technology transfer, though. So faced with this picture, investors are piling into safe-haven assets. Gold has hit a six-year high today, currently changing hands at $1,426 per ounce for the first time since 2013 (when eurozone crisis worries were raging). That\u2019s an increase of nearly 1%, adding to recent gains. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, analyst at London Capital Group, says money is \u201cpouring into gold\u201d. She adds: Investors are reluctant to move their capital elsewhere in the middle of a worsening US-Iran thunderstorm and ahead of the G20 summit. Traders are also shunning the US dollar, which is on its longest losing stretch in a year and a half. They\u2019re expecting the Federal Reserve to start slashing interest rates next month, especially now Trump is accusing them of childish incompetence... Also coming up today In London, MPs will be questioning the Financial Conduct Authority. Andrew Bailey, head of the City watchdog, can expect some tough questions over the Neil Woodford crisis. We\u2019re also expecting new UK retail sales figures, and US consumer confidence and housing data -- which may bolster the case for an interest rate cut.
