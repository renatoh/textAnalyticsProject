The industry was taken by surprise last year when Mr Spitzer filed a lawsuit against insurance brokers, alleging they were taking kickbacks in return for directing business to certain companies and acting against customers' best interests. Reforms have been introduced to stop the practices and increase the transparency of commission payments from insurers. The broker is to cut jobs in areas where the staff work for the insurance providers rather than the clients seeking insurance, to fit in with the reforms. Back office jobs in personnel, marketing and finance will be cut in line with the reduction in overall size. \"It is a fundamental reassessment of the market,\" said Dennis Mahoney, Aon UK's chairman and chief executive. \"We have taken the opportunity to look again at everything we do.\" He added that making redundancies was \"the worst part of this job\". The losses will be partly achieved by not replacing people who leave but there will also be redundancies. The worst-affected divisions are those selling insurance for unusual situations such as protecting oil rigs or accountancy firms. Mr Mahoney said the cuts were not related to the huge insurance losses created by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Aon will also reduce the number of buildings it has in this country so there is only one property for each city. The company has multiple offices thanks to successive mergers in the past. A rival broker, Marsh &amp; McLennan, has also implemented reforms and cut thousands of jobs worldwide. Aon is looking at restructuring operations in other countries as well. Mr Spitzer's allegations prompted a number of similar lawsuits from attorneys general in other states. Britain's Financial Services Authority looked at the issue but decided that it would not force brokers to disclose the commission payments they get from insurance providers. However, most brokers have changed their practices in this country so that clients know how much the broker is being paid."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
