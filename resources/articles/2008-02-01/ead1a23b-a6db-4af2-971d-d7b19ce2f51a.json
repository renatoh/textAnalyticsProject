A Los Angeles superior court commissioner placed the troubled pop singer under temporary conservatorship, a day after she was taken to a psychiatric hospital. The singer's father, James, who was in court along with her mother, Lynne, was named conservator of Spears herself, while he and a lawyer, Andrew Wallete, were named conservators of the estate. Conservatorships are created to care for people deemed by a court to be incapable of taking care of themselves or managing their finances. A court appoints another individual or organisation to act as the person's conservator, taking charge of the person's care or finances or, in some cases, both. The court also issued a restraining order against Britney Spears' manager and friend, Sam Lutfi, and gave permission to change the locks on her estate and remove anyone who is there. Commissioner Reva Goetz said Spears would be under conservatorship until February 4, at which time another hearing will be held. \"It is in the best interests of the conservatee to have conservatorship over her person,\" Goetz told a packed courtroom. The conservator will have the power to \"restrict visitors\", have around-the-clock security for Spears, and have access to all medical records, Goetz said, adding conservatorship over the estate was \"necessary and appropriate\". She gave approval for the conservator to \"take all actions to secure all liquid assets including credit cards\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
