The 29-year-old's decision follows the departures of George Boateng and Paul Merson who made adverse remarks about the club as they left for Middlesbrough and Portsmouth respectively. It also comes in the wake of Villa's failure to qualify for the Uefa Cup after being knocked out of the Intertoto Cup by Lille last week. There have been doubts over Alpay's long-term commitment to Villa during the summer and particularly since his performances in the World Cup when he played a key role in Turkey's advance to the semi-finals. In addition, last December he was upset at the way the club treated him after he injured an ankle against Leicester City. At the end of the World Cup he was named in Fifa's All-Star XI and that seems to have influenced his decision to demand such a large wage rise. \"He feels there's an opportunity for him after his performances in the World Cup which may not come again,\" said Villa's manager, Graham Taylor. \"He wants to see what might be available before the transfer window closes on August 31.\" To make the club's position clear, they took the unusual step of making the player's contractual arrangements public. \"The player was looking for a 50% increase on his current deal and the club will not meet that request,\" said a Villa spokesman. \"Alpay has two years of a four-year contract still to run and is already one of the highest-paid players at the club. \"It is not our general practice to discuss contractual situations but the club feels these are exceptional circumstances and the supporters should fully understand the situation.\" Alpay, who cost Villa \u00a35.6m when he joined from Fenerbahce and is understood to earn \u00a318,000 a week, has been linked with Leeds United and Chelsea. But both seem unlikely buyers because of financial problems. The German club Borussia Dortmund are also understood to be interested, but the transfer market in mainland Europe even more depressed than it is in England."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
