The Anfield manager, having begun his first full season at the club, is hoping that the key to future development is a stronger collective gut. Liverpool travel to Burnleyon Saturday after last weekend\u2019s exhilarating, if not entirely flawless, 4-3 victory over Arsenal. Having endured a difficult first half, Liverpool came back in the second 45 minutes to blaze into a 4-1 lead, only then to concede two more goals before full-time. Despite the attacking bent of his side, Klopp believes conceding goals need not be inevitable once the squad instinctively know their responsibilities on the pitch. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think before the game that it was a very offensive lineup\u201d, Klopp said of his selection at Arsenal. \u201cIt is but only if the players just think offensively. They all have a job to do in defence too. In the end I was not too happy with our defending in the first half but the chances Arsenal had were when we lost the ball.\u201d The German went on to explain what he saw as the reasons Liverpool conceded the opening goal in the match, scored by Theo Walcott. \u201cArsenal played good counter-pressing. They gave Adam Lallana no real chance to keep the ball and [Francis] Coquelin made a good tackle and a very good pass. We had four players there but we didn\u2019t orientate, so we didn\u2019t know who is where and who has which job to do. We need [Lallana] to jump out and make the offensive transition but then we have to fill up the spaces with the guys that are still there.\u201d For Klopp, these kind of insights come largely from post-match analysis but can be learned only through repetition on the training field. \u201cIt\u2019s a process of course,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had two hours\u2019 training today on it but it doesn\u2019t mean you know what to do when you\u2019re under pressure in a game. What we need is for the decision to be made here [in the gut], not here [in the head] but we are in the head right now. \u201cWe didn\u2019t make the training intensive or anything,\u201d Klopp went on, \u201cWe tried again to learn, with low intensity, how to play together, the passing movements we want to make, so that players can answer some questions: \u2018When I am here, where are you? Can I trust that you are really there? Are you protecting me so that I can then go over there?\u2019 All that stuff. Time together will help. So will experience together, success and good results. And at some point it will be here [in the gut] and then we can use it more easily.\u201d Lots will ride on whether the German is able to achieve his ambitions with his squad but he says it was possible to start the process properly only this summer, after their Europa League and Capital One Cup runs last season meant Liverpool played 63 games. \u201cWhen you learn something you cannot start with every detail or you lose the overview before you even started,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cLast year we didn\u2019t have a lot of time to analyse our games and by the time we did it was already the day before the next one. You were able to make little moves but not a real analysis. So we concentrated on a few things we tried to change. We tried to improve our physical ability.\u201d While Klopp\u2019s brand of football is avowedly attacking, he bristles at the idea that it is cavalier. \u201cI love clean sheets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looks different but I love it! I would never accept conceding goals before a game, to be honest. I\u2019ve never chosen a line-up where I\u2019ve thought, \u2018OK, maybe we can score five but with these guys we will concede four.\u2019 I never did this... \u201cIt\u2019s clear that we don\u2019t pass for the sake of passing. We want to create offensive spaces. We want to move the opposition. But until we know \u2018this is the pass\u2019, we don\u2019t have to take too much risk around the goal. You always have to take risks but not too much risk and so I was really pleased with this [in the game against Arsenal].\u201d \u201cWe know about the style of play,\u201d Klopp went on. \u201cStyle of play sounds a bit too big. I mean that we know how we want to play but now we have to prove it. That\u2019s what we feel. We have to show that we understand this and that we are prepared for this game. Take it, hopefully win it, then analyse it for the next game. It will be a different opponent and they will ask different questions maybe but we go again.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
