Hodgson took heart from his first competitive match in charge against a team unbeaten in 22 matches and believes a platform has been laid for further progress in the tournament. Indeed, it was a measure of both sides' expectations that the France full-back Patrice Evra admitted his side had ended \"frustrated\" by defensive tactics he suggested were identical to those that earned Chelsea a place in the European Cup final in Munich last month. \"We are frustrated that it ended in a draw,\" Evra said. \"I think we played much better than them. At times it was like there were 15 bodies on the line. It was really difficult for us to find the space because they played in the way that Chelsea played against Barcelona. People laugh\u2026 maybe they want England to play more football but, if they win the tournament like that, they will be happy.\" Those sentiments were shared by the France coach, Laurent Blanc, who insisted France had been \"the team playing the most football\". Yet England drew encouragement from their resilience and the flurries of anxiety they induced in their opponents in what had been perceived to be the most daunting fixture in Group D. \"I hope this gives us a good platform,\" Hodgson said. \"We played well and I am obviously pleased for the players most of all. We were playing against a top team who ask questions of you when they get the ball. They are very patient with a lot of talented players. When they get the ball around your final third they don't panic so you have to be very disciplined in your defending. \"So to come away with a 1-1 and to have asked the questions we did, I have got to be quite happy. Sure, we need to improve our final ball. The decision\u2011making in the final third was sometimes a bit anxious, but we'll get better. The longer we play together, the better we'll become. I hope we've established ourselves as hard to beat \u2013 you don't become a really good team in three matches and 10 training sessions \u2013 but we'll get match fitter with every day. I'm pleased the game's out of the way and pleased the players have shown they can cope well at this level.\" Joleon Lescott's goal had earned England a lead, albeit one held for only nine minutes. \"It was a really good, collective performance,\" said the Manchester City centre-half. \"You know what you will get with an English team \u2013 plenty of pride and passion \u2013 but we also looked good going forward and we can build on this. We had a gameplan here and now we can be confident going into every game. Our work ethic was important. No matter who we played, we couldn't afford to lose this opening game. Now we're in a good position to go play Sweden.\" That game is in Kiev on Friday, with the management staff to be depleted from now on in after Ray Clemence, one of the goalkeeping coaches, ruptured an achilles in the warmup. He will return to England for surgery. The full-back Martin Kelly was absent on Monday night through illness but should return to training this week. \"We are moving in the right direction,\" said the goalkeeper Joe Hart. \"We showed the right resilience, belief and pride, as well as quality. We move on from here.\" \"We're satisfied,\" said the captain, Steven Gerrard. \"We won't get carried away and it was always going to be a platform; nothing else. \"But it's great to get off the off the mark points-wise. Now we need to follow this up with a win.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
