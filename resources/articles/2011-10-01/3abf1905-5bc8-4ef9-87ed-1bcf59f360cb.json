That's why it must be protected", "bodyText": "Children seem to be disappearing. They are physically present, but infant clothes, toys and street games seem to have been subsumed by a rush to adulthood: mini grown-ups rule. The duty of parents and carers to build a metaphorical wall between their offspring and the nastier habits and practices of adult life is proving increasingly difficult, even for the very well-intentioned. It is not just that some parents can't say no or lack the inclination to impose boundaries. It is partly that the world of global internet entertainment appears all-powerful, constantly reinventing itself to outwit the latest parental imposition. Now, for instance, as the Observer reports, some children have fake Facebook accounts to hoodwink parents trying to exercise control. The advice given to adults concerned about what to do is: \"Familiarise yourself with the technology.\" For some of us, this is akin to hunting for dodos. Ofcom, the media regulator, has now told broadcasters that they must be more careful about showing \"sexualised\" music videos and live performances before the watershed of 9pm. More than a million children watched Christina Aguilera and Rihanna perform gynaecological aerobics on ITV's The X Factor last year. Given that children can watch anything anywhere so long as they have access to a laptop, does Ofcom's ruling matter? The Observer thinks it does. It is not prudery to believe that there is an adult duty to try to manage information on behalf of the children in one's care. Rihanna has talent that is more than her gyrating body parts, but it's the latter that six-year-olds copy. The Ofcom reinforcement of the importance of \"family shows\" before the watershed signals a position in society. It endorses the view that children are entitled to enjoy the freedom that comes with a sense of innocence. It reminds parents that simulating soft porn has no place in the playground."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
