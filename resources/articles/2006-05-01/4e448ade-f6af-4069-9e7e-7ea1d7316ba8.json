Yesterday Germany, backed by Luxembourg and Portugal, both home to low VAT regimes, blocked plans tabled by Austria for EU-wide laws to force companies to levy VAT at the normal rate in the country where the consumer lives rather than where the supplier is based. The plan is part of a wider campaign by the EU to crack down on VAT fraud which, according to Laszlo Kovacs, EU tax commissioner, costs billions of euros each year - or up to 10% of total tax revenues. The crackdown has partly been prompted by moves among internet telephony firms such as Skype and Freeserve, which is owned by Wanadoo, to register their businesses in, respectively, Luxembourg and Madeira, the Portuguese island. They levy VAT at a lower rate - 15% and 13% respectively - than, say, the 17.5% charged in the UK . Karl-Heinz Grasser, the Austrian finance minister, said: \"We want to adjust the VAT system to the modern era of electronic trade and there are lots of services involved, including telecoms and pay-TV. We have to ask ourselves whether it makes sense if you have the very low rates applied by an offshore island in Europe being used as a way of distorting competition.\" Mr Kovacs added that businesses could simply set up shop in EU countries with the lowest VAT rate. \"Until there's greater harmonisation we would prefer the country of consumption as a principle.\" Mr Grasser claimed there was enough momentum behind the plan to suggest that all 25 countries could adopt it in early June when finance ministers next meet, but Thomas Mirow, Germany's deputy finance minister, warned that Germany would not agree to it, and neither would Luxembourg. Separately, ministers rejected pleas for a windfall tax on oil companies making bumper profits from soaring prices."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
