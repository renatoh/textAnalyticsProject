City led through goals from David Silva and Fernandinho but George Boyd scored 76 seconds into the second half and Ashley Barnes\u2019s 81st-minute equaliser meant City failed to record a club-record 10th consecutive victory and allowed Chelsea to maintain their three-point advantage going into 2015. \u201cMaybe winning 2-0 we thought the game was over but until the last whistle the game is never finished,\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cSo we couldn\u2019t continue with the same pace. I can explain, of course I can explain \u2013 football has a lot of things that decide the score. We played well in the first half, we were 2-0 up. In the [second] minute of the second half Burnley score a clear offside goal. After that they scored the second from a rebound.\u201d Although Boyd may have been offside \u2013 the goal came from a Danny Ings cross that he appeared to touch past Joe Hart \u2013 and Pellegrini spoke of a heavy pitch and blamed his team\u2019s stamina, he claimed not to be blaming bad luck for the result. \u201cThe pitch was very heavy,\u201d the manager said. \u201cTwo games in 48 hours but we were winning 2-0. Once it was 2-2 we didn\u2019t have the legs to score. I am not saying we are unfortunate. I don\u2019t say that. I am saying in football just two balls can decide the score. I think we played very well in the first half. In the second half when they score, they grow.\u201d Of the missed chance to close in on Chelsea, the manager added: \u201cOf course it is a chance to have two more points but we have to play a complete second round. We finished the first round with 43 points; that is a good amount of points.\u201d Yaya Tour\u00e9 missed the match because of injury and Pellegrini said he would know on Monday whether the midfielder will be available for Sunderland\u2019s visit on New Year\u2019s Day. \u201cWe hope that he will be because it was a lesser problem but after 48 hours maybe it is too high a risk to repeat \u2013 [it is] a muscle injury in his groin. Yaya was not able to play today, 90 minutes. It was a risk for him. The players that played today were the players who were able to. \u201cYaya felt a problem at the beginning of the last game against West Bromwich. He was not 100% so I think it was not good for him to play today.\u201d Of Vincent Kompany, who has been missing because of muscular problems, Pellegrini said: \u201cWe will see tomorrow if he is fit for the next game. It is very difficult now to know. He has some problems still in his calf.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
