Pintupi man Gene Gibson was arrested and charged with the murder of 21-year-old Broome man Joshua Timothy Warneke in 2012, two years after Warneke was killed. The charge was downgraded to manslaughter last year after the Western Australian supreme court ruled evidence from Gibson\u2019s first two-day interview with police was inadmissible because he was not provided with an interpreter and did not understand his rights, particularly his right to silence. Gibson was later convicted on the manslaughter charge and is currently serving a seven-and-a-half-year jail sentence, but will be eligible for parole in 2018. The court\u2019s decision to rule the first interview inadmissible prompted the police commissioner, Karl O\u2019Callaghan, to order an internal investigation, which is being overseen by the Corruption and Crime Commission. In a statement, a spokeswoman for O\u2019Callaghan said the police officers, who WA police has declined to name, have been stood aside from their current roles but remained on duty. Another four police officers are being \u201cconsidered for managerial action\u201d. \u201cIt remains a matter for the police commissioner to consider what further action will follow,\u201d she said. Warneke was killed while walking home from a night out in Broome early in the morning of 26 February 2010. His body was found by the side of the Old Broome Road, and the cause of death was ruled to be head injuries combined with acute alcohol intoxication. At the sentencing hearing for the manslaughter charge in October, Justice Lindy Jenkins said that Gibson saw Warneke walking along the road, stopped the stolen car he was driving and hit him over the head with a metal pole. Police didn\u2019t speak to Gibson until more than two years after Warneke\u2019s death, after a number of witnesses said that Gibson had been driving a stolen car that hit a white man that night. By then Gibson had returned to his home of Kiwirrkurra, a community of about 200 people in the Gibson Desert near the Northern Territory border. It\u2019s one of the most isolated communities in Australia, located 1,200km east of Port Hedland and 850km west of Alice Springs, and interaction with non-Aboriginal people is low. Gibson, like many at Kiwirrkurra, primarily speaks Pintupi. According to the judgment handed down by Justice Stephen Hall in July last year, police travelled to Kiwirrkurra with the intent of interviewing him as a witness, despite originally intending to interview him as a suspect. They began talking to him in an unrecorded interview, until he allegedly admitted to hitting Warneke with a car. He was then arrested, cautioned, and the rest of the interview was recorded on a video camera. After being questioned in Kiwirrkurra for several hours, Gibson was taken in the back of a police wagon to Kintore police station, about 200km away, and held in a cell overnight before being taken to Broome for more questioning and a tour of the murder site. The court took that to be a continuation of the one interview. In his judgment, Hall said the decision to treat Gibson as a witness and not record the first part of the interview was \u201cplainly wrong\u201d and that, after Gibson was arrested, police violated his rights under the Criminal Investigation Act 2006 by failing to provide him with an appropriate interpreter. Hall also said the interview could not be said to be voluntary because Gibson did not understand he had the right to silence, and that the interview continued for six hours after his Aboriginal Legal Service lawyer told police, on the phone, that he did not want to answer any questions. Hall said Gibson\u2019s wishes were overridden because his English language comprehension was not sufficient to understand his rights, and also because the senior Pintupi man who sat in the interview as his friend was directing him, in Pintupi, to \u201ckeep telling them the truth\u201d. \u201cIn my view it is unlikely that the admissions of the accused would have been made at all if the interview had been properly conducted,\u201d Hall said. The WA police commissioner\u2019s orders and procedures manual orders police not to assume that Aboriginal people can speak English fluently, particularly policing jargon, and says they may need the use of an interpreter. However state funding to the state\u2019s only Aboriginal interpreter service, Kimberley Interpreting Service, was cut last year. The service is now solely reliant on federal money and has been approved for some funding under the Indigenous Advancement Strategy. Hall said the police officers who interviewed Gibson attempted to figure out his English proficiency by making small talk but that when his comprehension was formally tested at Casuarina prison in 2013 he was found to have only basic language skills. Warneke\u2019s mother, Ingrid Bishop, has been outspoken in criticising police handling of the investigation. She told the ABC that \u201cat least two or three officers\u201d involved in her son\u2019s case should leave the police force, and said she hoped O\u2019Callaghan would have the \u201ccourage to actually make a stand against incompetence and misconduct\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
