A fairly nondescript day in many ways, but the three stars, the guys who really turned up when the heat was on, are the ones at the top of the leaderboard. Brilliant rounds of 69 from Brandt Snedeker, Angel Cabrera and Adam Scott. Staunch efforts from Marc Leishman and Jason Day. Wonderful early-day blitzes from Matt Kuchar and, especially, Tim Clark with a best-of-day 67. And who's that four off the lead, a preposterous brouhaha now officially - look at the time, dear UK readers - yesterday's news? Why, it's Tiger Woods, no less! I tell you what, tomorrow is going to be the business. Please come and enjoy it with me. I'll miss you if you're not here, you know. -7 Snedeker Cabrera -6 Scott -5 Leishman Day -4 Kuchar -3 Clark Woods -2 Furyk Fowler Langer Westwood Stricker -1 Fernandez-Castano Watney Van Pelt SERGIO!!! Day, needlessly bold, trundles his birdie putt ten feet past the cup. This finish will really hurt if he can't knock in the return. And he doesn't, never committing to his par putt, the ball always likely to die in front of the cup, turning apologetically left. He taps in for bogey, and a one-over 73. He was looking well in control for a while. Couples taps in for his par and a sad 77. Couples is kaput. He dumps his approach at 18 into the bunker to the right of the green. Day puts his in Snedeker Country up at the back left of the green. Couples splashes out to four feet, a wonderful bunker shot, but he's got the funk on, and the smattering of embarrassed but sympathetic applause suggest the Patrons know it. He was -5 coming off the 13th, and now he's out of it. Better this happened today than on Sunday, I guess, though that's not a theory I'd posit anywhere near Freddie's coupon or within the reach of his 7-iron. Jason Day, who had a wedge into the green and hasn't put a foot wrong today, three putts and registers his first bogey of the round. The par putt he missed was from no more than three feet, catching the lip on the left before spinning out on the right. Oh me, oh my. That is disastrous. But not as disastrous as this: Couples also misses a tiddler, but his was for a double-bogey six. That's a seven, and he's back to level par for the championship. The dream, as we'd already suspected, is over. The pair clatter their drives straight down 18, a particularly smooth catharsis in Freddie's case. Leishman can't drain his putt, but he's not too far off, and taps in for par. He'll sign for a par round of 72, a decent effort when you consider it all looked like slipping away from him after back-to-back bogeys on 4 and 5. But that's not the big news on 18, for Cabrera slides his uphill eight-footer straight into the cup, and he finishes with a birdie! He signs for a 69, tied for the lead at -7, and there'll be a spring in the old boy's step: after those bogeys at 12 and 13, and the three putt at 15, he could have been forgiven for losing it, but the tee shot at 16 sparked him back into life, and a finish of 2-4-3 isn't to be sniffed at around Augusta. Not quite Schwartzelesque, but hey, what is? Cabrera blooters a drive down 18. It's huge. Leishman then sends his whistling past. They're both in prime position. Cabrera bumps his approach in, with a gentle fade, to eight feet in front of the hole. A wonderful shot. Leishman again follows, though this time he's a good 20 feet outside. If it wasn't alongside Cabrera's fine effort, that'd look pretty good. Meanwhile late in a day in which a lot of hot air has been spoken, here at last is the voice of reason, Mac Millings: \"Jason Dufner may be The Somnambulist, but he's definitely The Prestidigitator. Look at him in the photo, levitating that golf ball. Snedeker, meanwhile, is trying to pull the wool over our eyes. He'd like us to think he's floating that club, but it's quite obvious that he has a baby waving it around for him.\" Leishman duffs his chip up the bank slightly, and can't knock in the par effort. He moves back to -5. Cabrera two putts for his par, another missed opportunity, but he remains at -6. And Snedeker knocks his 25-footer from the corner of the 18th dead, then taps in for a blemish-free 69. He's the joint leader of this tournament alongside Day, who along with Couples has just parred 16. Scott takes two putts for his par on 18, and signs for a 69. He's -6 and right in the mix for this Green Jacket. Slightly fortunate on the last, mind. As is Snedeker, whose loose drive has clattered back onto the fairway, and he sends his long second to the top-left corner of the green. He'll have two putts for a 69. Another dropped shot by Couples, this time on 15, his putter again letting him down. He's suddenly back at -3. Day, alongside him, scrambles for his par, a staunch effort; he remains in the joint lead at -7. Mixed fortunes meanwhile for Cabrera and Leishman on 17; the former holds the back of the green near the pin with a lovely approach, the latter sends his through the back and down a tricky bank. And on 18, Snedeker follows Scott in belting his drive into the woods, though his slices off into the thicket on the right. Scott hooks his drive at 18 into the pine needles down the left. Day bumps an outstanding pitch up on to the green at 15, averting disaster which could so easily have arrived with a bunch of flowers. Lee Westwood pulls his approach to 18 but manages to get up and down from the left, sinking a 15-footer for par. He signs for a 73, which isn't ideal, but he's only five behind as things stand. And Scott was so far left with that errant drive that he's got a route into the green through the gap behind Lyle's Bunker, so he can reach the front of the dancefloor. Again, not ideal, but he could have been in all sorts of trouble there. Q: Did you consider withdrawing? A: No. Under the rules of golf, the rule is, the rule is. Under the rules of golf, I was able to play. Sounds fair enough to me. Move along, everyone! Nothing to see here! Leishman puts his ball inside Cabrera's! He's got a three-footer for birdie! He'll tap in, but only after Cabrera does so himself. The pair birdie, and move a shot behind the leaders. This is how it all looks: -7 Snedeker (17) Day (14) -6 Scott (17) Leishman (16) Cabrera (16) -4 Kuchar (F) Couples (14) Adam Scott, who came so heartbreakingly close at the Open last year, has clearly decided it's time for another tilt at a big prize. Who'd deny him one? He's birdied 13, 15 and now 17, prodding a lovely effort from the back of the green to the left of the cup, the ball turning in at the last and dropping. Cabrera, who has been buggering around for a while now, snaps out of it and smacks his tee shot at 16 into Snedeker Range. You can't trust his putter, of course, but that's one hell of a birdie chance. Back on 15, Day booms a ludicrous fairway wood right over both water and green! He's got a proper puzzle to get that one onto the dancefloor, because he's in semi-rough near a tree, he's got loads of bank to climb, and there's water on the far side of the green. Good luck! Snedeker taps in for his birdie on 16 - his third in four holes - and he's tied for the lead with Jason Day. He's one of the few players, perhaps the only one, who is enjoying himself out there today. That happy-go-lucky attitude to life is doing him a lot of favours, as everyone else's nerves tighten and tempers fray. Cabrera, for example, has always been a jittery player - he did his best to throw both of his majors away at various points - and he's not finishing off today's round with particular confidence. He's three-putted 13 already, and now he's done the same on 15, trundling a lunatic eagle putt miles past the hole. His playing partner Leishman couldn't make a birdie at the par-five either, but he's at least got the excuse of having seen his approach fall off the back of the green, leaving him with an almost impossible chip which he executed very nicely indeed, the water threatening anything too bold, the slope up to the green likely to claim anything too timid. This could be Brandt Snedeker's time. He's not fannying around. He's just birdied 15 to move to -6, and then clipped the tee shot of the day at 16 to four feet. He'll have that putt for a share of the lead. Couples meanwhile is flattering to deceive a wee bit, a birdie at 13 followed immediately by bogey at 14, the veteran oscillating around the -4 mark. Trouble for Tiger down the 18th, after a very stuttering perambulation down 17, where he skirted with trees without coming a serious cropper. He's again near the woods, this time to the front left of Lyle's Bunker, and his second ends well short of the green, his club snagging in the thick grass, or perhaps hitting an exposed root. But he gets up and down, and will scribble for a two-under 70. Unless, of course, some eagle-eyed pedant out there fancies phoning CBS to justify their existence. Anyways, Tiger's at -3 for the tournament, and will be featuring at the business end of this Masters. Sergio news. He nearly drains a 40-footer up the green for birdie on 18, but he'll have to do with a par, and he's -1 for the tournament after a 73. His playing partner, Bernhard Langer, signs for a 72; he's -2 for the tournament. There is a 22-year age difference between these two, a gap which can also be measured by the width of two Green Jackets. Two putts from Jason Day on 13, and that's his first birdie of the third round after a dozen pars. He's up to -7, and leading this tournament by two strokes, because on 14 Leishman misses a tiddler for par, sticking the ball out to the right, from where it was never coming back. Leaderboard in a minute. Yes, I know I've kind of forgotten about them. But I haven't forgotten about them! Scott enjoys quite a stroke of good fortune on 15, hitting a lazy second into the green. The ball makes it over the water, but only onto the bank. It really should roll back into the murky darkness, but somehow sticks on the incline. He picks up his pace as he walks towards the ball, perhaps fearful that gravity will return from Butlin's and hoof the dimpled orb unceremoniously into the water. Justin Rose takes a step forward, Justin Rose takes a step back. He's just three-putted 16 to drop another shot, falling back to -1. I'm not convinced his thin stick is hot enough to do anything here this weekend. On 14, Cabrera responds to that egregious disgrace on 13 by booming a drive down the middle then lifting a wedge into the centre of the green. He's not so close that a birdie should be expected, but it's a chance. The Somnambulist: the people's choice. \"Please, Scott,\" begs Liz Warren, \"tell me what my TV coverage won't: what's happened to the Sleepy One? He seems to be sliding down the leader board somewhat.\" I'm afraid our hero has just registered back-to-back bogeys on 13 and 14; he's dropped five shots in the last six holes. A real shame. Looking at it from a positive angle, I'm sure he doesn't give a toss. Oh Angel! This is distressing. He plops his third into the heart of the green at 13, but the slope takes the ball away from the hole. No matter, two putts and he'll have a par that didn't look possible from behind that tree. And he should have it, tapping his first putt to three feet, but he takes an age to settle for the par putt, betraying his nerves, and prods a hopeless effort past the hole. Bogey, his second in a row. Meanwhile his playing partner Leishman heads the other way, narrowly missing an eagle effort after safely finding the centre of the green with his second, and tapping in the birdie putt. He joins Jason Day in the lead at -6, though for how long is questionable, as behind him Day has just sent his second at 13 into the green. Snedeker's buggered his card of pars. But he won't mind the blemish; it's a birdie at 13. Meanwhile up on 16, Tiger manages to get up and down from sand for his birdie. And we've not heard from Justin Rose for a while, but he's just birdied 15, and is back at -2. There are a lot - a lot - of players who'll be eyeing the prize. This is one hell of a bunched leaderboard! Cabrera's snookered behind a tree! His ball's right by the exposed roots, too. This is almost impossible. But he somehow manufactures a punch shot to hook the ball round the wooden foe and down the hill of the fairway! That's sheer brilliance. That's an advert for the benefits of rabid meat and red wine consumption. All hail Angel! It's all happening. Tiger's tee shot at 16 finds a bunker short of the green, to the right. Cabrera's tee shot at 13 is deep in the forest. Couples hits his tee shot at 12 to eight feet. And Steve Stricker won't sleep well tonight. He's just double bogeyed 18, missing a tiddler for bogey. Having got himself all the way up to -4, signing for a 71 and an overall position of -2 won't pleasure him in the slightest. ... the leader Cabrera dumps his tee shot at 12 into the sand at the front of the green. He then has an amazing stroke of luck, his bunker shot squirting out to the right but failing to roll down the bank and into the water. He quickly gets up and down for a bogey, dropping back to -6 alongside Jason Day, whose card through 11 is a chain of pars. Shot of the day from - who else? - Tiger Woods! He clatters a long iron over the water at 15, the ball landing on the front of the green and stopping 15 feet from the pin. What a chance for an eagle! His putt rolls just past the cup on the left, and he'll have to settle for a birdie, the very least that hole owes him. What a story an eagle would have been. Ah well. And he's still at -3, which is only three off the lead now because ... Lucky Lee Westwood, whose ball has stuck on the bank in the hazard. Does he take advantage? Does he buggery. His splash out dies halfway up the green, then rolls back. He'll have to make do with two putts and a miserable par, which given the majesty of his drive is a total nonsense. This is quite something by Marc Leishman. His fourth at 11, a chip from the dropzone, is nothing short of appalling, right in the middle of the green, nowhere near the pin. But he drains the long bogey putt. He looks... well, not nerveless, exactly, but he's not consumed by them. Compare and contrast with McIlroy, who went on to run up a triple bogey. He said after yesterday's round, a 73, that he only really felt properly nervous on the opening day. Considering he shot a 66 then, the flippant conclusion would be that the nerves did him some good. But this is a staunch display today, he's hanging on in there, and his impressive constitution may pay dividends in the long run if he stays in contention. Cabrera gets up and down for his par, by the way. Brandt Snedeker has 11 straight pars on his card. At 12, he puts his tee shot into a thicket at the back of the green. Oh dear? Oh no no no! He has a quick look, sniffs briskly, then clips an improvised wedge from a tight lie to two inches. That's a dozen pars, some scorecard for one of the most entertaining players on the tour. Cabrera has cojones, baby. He's got cojones up the yin-yang! From the left of 11, in the semi rough, where Dufner met his watery match, he powers an iron into safer territory down the right of the fairway, but draws it back into the green, past the pin and just off the back. That'll do. Attempting to steer it back with that draw took some courage. It would certainly have done Leishman, who yanks a useless approach off the bank and into the drink. And while we're on the subject of the water, and cojones, here's Lee Westwood, from a perfect position on 13, sticking his long iron straight into the creek. What a toolkit. He just doesn't have a major championship in him, he always seems to come up a tad short whenever the vital questions are asked. Couples makes his birdie on 10. That would have been a total disgrace if he had ruined all that perfect work, but it has been known, you'd never bet the mortgage on Fred from short range. He's back to -4, though, and after parring the first six holes he's gone double-birdie-bogey-birdie. Steady now! Couples refuses to lie down. He splits the 10th fairway with his tee shot, then sends his second pin high to eight feet. If he can put that in, we're motoring again! Speaking of momentum, nothing's really been happening for Lee Westwood today, bogeys at 4 and 7 and a birdie at 9, but he's just belted a monster down 13. At -2, this could be his time to make a move. And speaking of making moves, Tiger follows up his birdie at 12 with another at the par-five 13th, putting his approach into the bunker back left of the green, then getting up and down with little drama. He's -2 - and still, in more ways than one, folks, very much in this tournament!!! All hail Angel! He's got a 25-foot putt down the green at 10 for birdie. He has to set it off about 15 feet left of the hole, but it curves round and rolls into the cup, one of those beauties that looked inevitable about halfway along its journey. He's -7, the sole leader, and here's a great stat: he only has two wins in his entire PGA Tour career, and he's 43 now. Those wins? The 2007 US Open, and the 2009 Masters. Is the hat-trick on? An appalling stroke of luck for The Somnambulist on 11. Dufner sends his second straight down the track towards the green. It takes an enormous bounce left, and into the lake. No reaction still, but then did you really expect one? A double-bogey 6, and he's back to -2 after going so well for the first eight holes. A reaction from the crowd at 9, though, Couples missing a five-footer for par, and dropping back to -3. That's possibly going to be even more painful than the double at 7. A blowout for Justin Rose on 12, who had been sitting nicely at -2. He finds the bunker at the front, then blasts out to the one at the back. He can't get up and down, and that's how easy it is to run up a double bogey around Augusta. Some crucial par savers! Up on 16, Stricker keeps things going by knocking in a par putt from the apron. That'll feel like a birdie. As will a huge par rake for Westwood on 11, who remains at -2. And Kuchar's having some of that action too on 17, with a 15-footer and a cheeky grin. They could all make the difference tomorrow. What's Tiger done here? He's sent his drive into the Mickelson Pine down 13, where Lefty did for Lee Westwood with that shot from behind the trees in 2011. But that's nothing compared to the drive Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano hits, a blootering slice miles into the trees down the right. He drops his club over his shoulder after the follow-through, screams FORE!!! in the trenchant style, then sing-songs a very lyrical \"What is tha-aaa-tttt?!\" He's more amused at the sheer berserk nature of the ball's flight than annoyed. Anything could happen here. A couple of lovely putts here. On 9, the co-leader Leishman is this close from knocking in a 25-foot right-to-foot curler for birdie, and the outright lead. But that's par. Meanwhile up on 12, Tiger drains a straight 25-footer from the back portion of the green. He's -1, only five behind, and not out of this despite it all. Sergio's -1 too, only five behind, but y'know. What a response to that nightmare on 7 from Couples! He's just wafted a 60-yard wedge to 12 inches. \"You couldn't do it any better than that,\" is the analysis of Butch Harmon, and who is going to argue with the one of the greatest tutors of all time? That's a birdie; he's back to -4, two off the lead. I've not been paying much attention to Steve Stricker because, well, y'know, come on. But more fool me, because the Steadiest Putter In The World 1998-2011 has just birdied 12, 14 and 15. He's -3 for his round, and -4 overall. This course is beginning to act up, with quite a few players struggling, so if the likes of Stricker and Kuchar can get home without too much drama, they'll be in a good place come tomorrow. We have two new co-leaders! On 9, Cabrera rolls a gentle left-to-right birdie effort across and down the green from 15 feet. It drops, and he's -6. As is Leishman, who having unraveled, has er, re-raveled! He picks up his second birdie in a row at 8, and he's back at the top. This is beginning to turn very antipodean: Jason Day and Leishman are co-leading, and Adam Scott, having raked in a birdie putt at 3 and parred every other hole to the turn, is sitting in joint fourth, two strokes behind on -4. Aye, it's a double for Couples; he's back to -3. Bah. And here's a killer stat: until yesterday, Freddie had only double-bogeyed the 7th hole once in his entire career. Now he's doubled it twice in two days. Golf, eh? Bloody effing hell. Meanwhile The Somnambulist drops a shot on 9, though that's not a bad result seeing he was playing three out of the trees way down the fairway. And Kuchar's up and down day continues, with a bogey at 14 and a birdie at 15. He's still at -4, and not far from the comfort of the clubhouse. I guess most players, if they could, would swap with the incredible smiling man. On 11, Rory has sent a wedge clumsily into the water at the front-left of the green, perhaps guilty of trying to chase things too much, +1 for the day as he was. Well, he's +4 for the day now, having run up a triple-bogey 7. Oh dear. Oh Rory! And there's more sorry news brewing further back. On 7, Couples sends a flyer through the green into a bunker at the back. His splash out is too strong, and rolls past the hole and all the way down to the front of the green. And then the putt back up the green - nominally the par putt - takes a sharp right-hand turn and buggers off back down another, slightly softer, slope. A double-bogey will be the likely result now. On 7, Leishman arrests his decline with a superb downhill birdie tickler from 15 feet - he's back up at -5 - while up at 8 The Somnambulist rattles in a ten-footer to move to the same mark... -6Day (6) -5 Leishman (7) Couples (6) Dufner (8) Cabrera (7) Tiger's got that look on his coupon, because after the surreal lip-out on 8, he's just failed to get up and down from the front of the prairie-like 9th, dropping a shot and falling back to -1 again. That's a harsh few minutes for the pre-tournament favourite. Here's the flip side: Matt Kuchar, so fortunate that his par putt on 12 fell in, now birdies 13 to move to -3. \"They really need to put this so called controversy to bed,\" writes Niall Mullin. \"He made a mistake and he took his medicine. Done. Otherwise it's a whole load of pompous eejits getting exercised about the minutiae of the rules in a sport with bigger problems like, say, its dubious attitudes on race and gender relations. This sort of nonsense should be known as 'doing a Millwall' i.e. behaving in a way that confirms others' prejudices.\" Angel Cabrera has just curled in a magnificent left-to-right breaker on 6 for birdie. He's now -5, and only a stroke off the lead. Meanwhile on 5, Freddie Couples draws his approach round a tree and onto the back of the green, within 12 feet of the pin. Shooting blind into the green, that was a superlative shot. He jumps and dances after it, albeit very gingerly, a superannuated version of Sergio's famous jig at Medinah back in 1999. Golf really is a game for all generations, and that's why it's the greatest sport there is. Leishman is beginning to unravel. More uncertain shenanigans on the green at 5, and he's back to -4. The final grouping of leader Jason Day (-6) and second-placed Fred Couples (-5) has been fairly quiet of late. Pars all the way. \"I suppose the key point is: did Tiger know he was breaking the rules?\" begins Simon McManhon. \"Only he knows for sure, but the answer is surely no. In which case he has been punished enough. Only the officials (and sponsors?) know whether the outcome would have been the same had it been any other player. All things considered, it makes the treatment dished out to Tianlang Guan on Friday seem even more absurd.\" Aye, if there's a real rules scandal this week, it's that spiteful and ungenerous decision. But we know what the headlines will be. Hey, I don't write 'em. Tiger really is having no luck whatsoever. He pushes his approach to the par-five 8th to the right of the green, and is forced to lob a chip over a grassy sea of undulating nonsense. It's an almost impossible task, getting close to the pin, but he manages it, the genius, leaving himself a four-footer for birdie. He taps it at the hole. Instead of toppling in from the right, it wall-of-deaths through 360 degrees, before exiting on the right and sitting arrogantly on the turf. It's only a surprise the ball didn't grow a face and arms, turn in Tiger's direction, grin malevolently, and flick the Vs at the 14-time major winner. I've never seen anything like that before. Some will say that's karma coming to tweak Tiger's tail, but that'd be arrant nonsense, bull, pish, tish, mummery and poppycock. \"It's back on, it's back on!\" jabbers an excited Duncan Searle. \"Sergio has only gone and made his first birdie since we got all giddy and excited on friday. Vamos!\" Indeed he has. Sadly for Sergio, before his birdie at the par-five 8th, he'd not only bogeyed 1, he'd dropped a shot at 7 too. So he's still +1 for the day, albeit still -1 for the competition. B at best. Matt Kuchar dropped a shot at 11, and he's so nearly carding back-to-back bogeys, but his far-too-firm par putt on 12 catches the lip at 11 o'clock, horseshoes round the back, and falls in. He's still -3, and smiling broadly - some would say cheekily - as he scampers off the green, the saucy pup. Angel Cabrera dropped one at the par-five 2nd, but he's grabbed it back at the very next hole, to remain at -4. And there's a sad affair involving Justin Rose at 7, who sends a 20-foot birdie effort from the back of the green past the hole and all the way off the front. Augusta National, ladies and gentlemen. He does well to get in for a bogey, but he's back to -2. Lynn's stemmed the bleeding all right! He's fired his tee shot at 6 to 12 feet, and rolled in the birdie putt with such confidence that he was trotting after it in the jaunty style before it had dropped. He's back to -1. Back on 4, the co-leader Leishman relinquishes his status by finding sand with his tee shot, then after splashing nicely to eight feet, prodding a hysterical par putt eight fee past the hole. He does well to knock the bogey putt home. In goes Tiger's birdie putt. He's back to -2. It's notable that not everyone in the gallery was applauding that deserved bird. Not quite a 50-50 split, but there are plenty of folk who are making an ostentatious show of refusing to acknowledge him. Maybe that's the usual split, maybe a lot of folk simply don't clap. I dunno, I never pay any attention to the crowds usually. I probably shouldn't have mentioned it, to be honest. There's me making something out of nothing. Meanwhile it's been a hell of a start for poor David Lynn, who has bogeyed 1, 2 and 4 to drop back to level par, and is in severe danger of letting another slip at 5, facing a mammoth two putts for par from the front of the green. But he gets up and down well, and hopefully that'll stem the bleeding. A Masters without Tiger? No thanks. No thanks. He's in the semi-rough down the left of 7. It's not going to be easy to get much spin from there, but he manages it, landing the ball right next to the hole, and stopping it not much further on. That's a magnificent birdie chance. Matt Kuchar, by the way, has reached the turn in 33, after adding a birdie at 8 to the earlier ones at 2 and 3. He's -4. The Somnambulist. Dufner's just skelped his tee shot at the par-three 4th to three feet. It was arrowing straight at the hole before sliding off left just before the cup. He rolls the birdie putt in, and moves to -4. Meanwhile we have a new joint leader: Marc Leishman, who birdies 2 to join Jason Day at -6. Trouble for Rory on 7. In the trees down the right, he's forced to punch out and deliberately look for the bunker at the front of the green, with a view to splashing out and taking the one putt. Which he does. Problem is, he leaves his first bunker shot in the sand. So that's a bogey, and he's back to -2. And trouble for Woods on 6, whose tee shot finds the back of the green, leaving a long putt back down the hill. He takes two for par, though the long left-to-right breaker isn't read particularly well, and he's forced to rattle in a tricky five-footer. He's -1 for the tournament. \"I don't know much about golf's opaque rules, but I do know about self-righteousness,\" writes the self-deprecating Gary Naylor. \"Those claiming he should disqualify himself having already been penalised by the officials, really do sound absurd. You would think he'd dropped it in the hole, the way some people are talking.\" So, the big story of the day so far: Tigergate Tim Clark. His approach to 18 isn't all that, and he's got to flop a chip over the bunker. He doesn't have the sharpest short game, and can't get his third closer than 20 feet. Yet he nearly knocks the par putt in, the ball rolling down the green and turning left at the last as it should, but one roll too far to drop. A shame to end such a fantastic round with a blemish, but he's signing for a five-under 67, and he's -3 overall. He'll at least have some sort of part to play tomorrow, then, no more than he deserves for that magnificent effort. Tiger putts from the edge of the fifth green, the ball unerringly on line. The crowd begins to cheer, he jumps up and down on the spot, and the ball stops an inch short. He's essentially been an inch or two out on three of his five putts so far. Keep it up, and if he adds all those inches together at the end of the day, he'll probably about two foot short. Which is ironic. Anyway, with that, Scott's back from watching The Voice to guide you through the rest of the day. Furyk and Snedeker, Cabrera and Leishman are all through the first with pars, Justin Rose has birdied the fourth though to go to -4. Tim Clark, though, will have work to do at the 18th. His approach is some way off course and he'll have a tricky chip to the pin. Uh-oh: Tiger's dropped a shot at the fourth, a makeable putt swinging round the back of the hole and staying out. He's back to level par for the day. Here's hoping for either burn-up or breakdown over the next few holes \u2026 His iron into the fifth green slaps onto the turf, then rolls slowly off the back of the green, just stopping on the fringe. Nick Watney's handed his card in with a 68 written on it. It's been a topsy turvy sort of a day with four bogeys to go with six birdies and an eagle but, boy, will he be cursing that 78 on the opening day. He's 72-69-68 so far, -1 for the tournament. Dustin Johnson's steadied the ship, rattling in pars at six and seven. Meanwhile, apologies, I've been very remiss. What of Sergio? A bogey five to get things started, then three pars that leave him -1 for the tournament. Oh, Sergio. \"Evening Tom,\" ahoys Simon McMahon. \"We're all friends here, eh? Tell me, is it The Voice or BGT that Scott's off to watch?\" I see Scott as a Voice man. All the razzamatazz, though still the more obscure choice. Woods is coming into four, five, six, seven and eight. So far this year, he's birdied every single one of those holes except four (over two separate rounds). Do the same again and he's -6 and in a share of the lead. Rory McIlroy is rattling along steadily enough. He birdied three and nearly sank another one at five and sits in eighth at -3. Tim Clark has birdied the par 3 16th and moves into a share of fourth. He's four under for the tournament and six under today with none of the other top four out at the moment. Suggests there are scores out there to be had today. Clark's iron into the 16th green was absolutely immaculate, dribbling an inch or two past the hole. Meanwhile, on three, Tiger's just missed another birdie chance and has stomped off the green. He's been within a hair or two of birdying the first three holes. The Augusta course recognises a former champion and gives Sandy a break. He fires an iron into the green at 11 and it rolls, rolls, rolls gently down towards the water. The second cut just keeps him out of the drink though, the grass here giving a Green Jacket the touch of respect he deserves. He's four over for the tournament, and three over for the day after a double bogey at seven, bogeys at four and nine and a birdie on the second. Tim Clark, for a little while the hottest man on the course, has settled down somewhat. After birdying two, four, five, six, seven and 13, he bogeyed 14 and has made do with a par at the 15th. He's five under for the day and three under for the tournament, tied in seventh. Tianlang Guan has carded a 77 for his third round, following his 73 and 75 for the first two rounds. So that's his worst round yet, leaving him nine over for the tournament. So well done that waddling official who gave him what for yesterday, well done for knocking a 14-year-old off his game. Evening all: here's the news as I step in for a bit.Tiger's got a face on, has pulled out a petrol can and set fire to the course. His second shot on the first went to within a couple of feet and he's just missed a birdie putt at the second by an inch. Dustin Johnson's in the midst of a meltdown, however, and has followed birdies at two and three with bogeys at four and five meaning that, all in all, he'd be in exactly the same position if he'd simply stayed in bed and not bothered coming out today. Tiger's out!!! And he's birdied the 1st. Haw. Lovely. You can already hear mini-explosions of impotent rage going off left, right and centre in the minds of the self-righteous and worthy. Me? I'll just be reporting the golf. And look at it this way: this is going to be top-quality entertainment, however you personally slice it. \"So a viewer tells them Tiger has done something wrong and they have to check it,\" hums Brendan Large. \"What about all the players who don't have EVERY SINGLE SHOT televised? If the rules officials don't see a problem, there is no problem.\" Mind you, I say \"I'll just be reporting the golf\", but that's not totally true. Because for a wee while, I'm handing over to Tom Bryant, the man they're all calling Tee Time Tommy, while I chow down in a large bowl of Hamburger Helper, the only dubious \"food-flavoured\" item to be shilled by a talking golf glove. See you soon! Dustin Johnson and Steve Stricker follow Matt Kuchar's lead with birdies at 2 and 3. All three of them are now -2 for the day and -3 overall, though Kuchar has played a hole more, having just parred the 4th. It's beginning to look like there's a score to be had out there after all. \"Who's your dream meltdown pairing?\" asks James Ferguson. \"I hope Tiger and Sergio (ah, Sergio...) catch fire today and are paired up tomorrow, both entertaining Green Jacket dreams. That would make for scintillating shoe-throwing, club-kicking Sunday viewing when all goes horribly wrong around Amen Corner.\" That would indeed be wonderful. Hopefully they'd be followed round by a pairing of Jason 'Somnambulist' Dufner and Fred Couples. Judicious cutting between the two pairings would create an effect not wholly dissimilar to the denouement of The Blues Brothers, when Jake and Elwood are in the elevator listening to The Girl from Ipanema while all those SWAT teams are being mobilised outside. Nick Watney is going like a train: having birdied 11, 13 and 14, he's just eagled 15 with a monster putt from the apron at the back of the green, a huge left-to-right breaker which rolled all the way down the hill and toppled into the hole with its very last joule of energy. His grin is brighter than that hot yellow thing in the infinite blue. He's -4 for his round, and -1 overall. How he'll regret that opening day 78, because he posted a 69 yesterday, and now look! A very uncharacteristically scrappy 75 by Matt Kuchar yesterday. He remained well in contention regardless, and he's certainly that now, having birdied 2 and 3 to make perhaps the most significant move near the top of the leaderboard so far today. Also with the early birdies: Bill Haas, Steve Stricker and the always-entertaining Dustin Johnson, the nearest thing mentally the USA has to a Sergio. \"Is there a golfer more suited to the C&amp;W genre than John Daly?\" wonders Simon McMahon. \"If there is, I can't think of one. The Wild Thing is the golfing equivalent of Gram Parsons, except he's not dead, of course. BTW, country music is not 'tat'.\" No, sir, you're right to pull me up on that one, so by way of apology, and seeing all eyes are on Georgia, here's a track from a C&amp;W concept album about the Deep South (which coincidentally sounds like dinnertime at the Dalys, albeit on a quiet day). On Sky Sports - so presumably on CBS too - one of the two \"Featured Pairings\" is Stewart Cink and DA Points. I'm just going to leave that hanging there, without comment. Another birdie for Olesen, his fourth under-par hole in a row; he's now -1 for this tournament. Tim Clark meanwhile has simmered down a wee bit, three pars in a row, but he's still -5 for the day through 10, and -3 overall. \"People saying there will be an asterisk next to Tiger's name if he wins,\" writes Mike Panasiuk, \"but really to win he would have to play a cracking 36 holes now for that to happen, and that would be a testament to how good he is. Would love to see him come out angry now and shoot 65 or so. Unfortunate for him, because he'd be leading most likely if his initial shot on 15 yesterday was two more inches left. Ahh well, let's go Freddie!\" Yeah, I'd like to see him come out in a hot funk and tear the place up. Having said that, I'd also like to see him fuming and lose it completely. His meltdown on 16 the other year, when he dropped the club on the follow through and hoofed it up the hole, was one of my favourite sporting moments of all time, as hilarious as professional sport gets. I love Tiger, I love him when he's blasting the field away, I love him when he's coming out on top in a tight tussle, I love him when he just gets pipped, I love him when he's ballsing up bigstyle and going thermonuclear. It just ain't the same when he's not around. This round's going to be pretty damn interesting. Phil Mickelson's found the water for his third consecutive hole, his second at 13 landing on the green side of Rae's Creek but hitting a bank, kicking right, and dunking back into the snaky water. He still manages to scramble his par with a wonderful up-and-down - player and officials took an age to determine where he could drop, by the way, as if they've got the fear on about something or other - but nevertheless he's left four shots along Amen Corner. We'll miss Lefty tomorrow, it's never quite the same when he's not there. Thorbjorn Olesen, who looks to have the game and the attitude to land a major one day, is making a fine fist of his debut at Augusta. He's bounced back from a nightmare bogey-bogey start to his back nine with birdie on 12, eagle on 13, and another birdie on 14. The big Dane, who had such a good Open last year at Lytham, is -4 for his round as a result, and level par for the tournament. I'm hungry. Bubba's not hung about. He's done one! He's signed for a two-under 70, having dropped a shot at the last. That round could have been a whole lot better - he carded six birdies - but two bogeys and a double just about sums up his week. He's +2 for the tourney, and he'll not be joining that elite list of players who have held onto their jacket: Nicklaus, Faldo, Woods. \"Pimento cheese is SERIOUS business in the south,\" reports Wendy Mitchell. \"I think you might need to get Paula Deen to set the record straight.\" A random quote from this film: \"You'll think you've got too much mayonnaise in it, but when it comes out of the fridge, it'll be as hard as my arteries.\" Good grief. I only hope that Jamie Oliver isn't a Guardian-reading golf fan; he'll be having a heart attack himself if he sees this. And now Mickelson's found the creek at 12 with his tee shot for the second day in a row! He's not in a funk, though, he's merely got the defeated air of a puppy who's just found out the cat's made off with all the maple bacon. Another double, he's +8. And it's a shame, it's so nice to see him bound around Augusta with his tongue lolling out as he goes on a birdie blitz late Sunday afternoon. Not this year, sadly. Not this year. Tiger thinks he's got it hard? Lefty's had a poor week, and it's not getting better for him today. He's just plonked his approach to 11 in the briny, then missed a short-ish bogey putt. That double is the latest egregious insult, he was already one over for the day, and now he's +6 for the tournament. \"Has Bull turned into Burroughs?\" worries Gary Naylor. \"Spending too much time at Augusta National can do that to anyone I suppose.\" Tim Clark's round is threatening to turn into one for the ages. He's just carded his fourth birdie on the bounce, this time at 7. He's -5 for the round, and -3 for the tournament. \"Glad to hear Tiger's okay, and also looking forward to some actual golfing action,\" begins Paul Taylor, with a none-too-subtle hint for me to get my bloody finger out. \"In the meantime, can you advise how my man John Daly is doing this time out? I can't find him on the leaderboard, must be off his game.\" Ah yes, irony applied with a gossamer touch. The Wild Thing has, of course, not played in the Masters since 2006, and not made the cut since 2002. In fact, his record at the Masters is appalling, save for an outlier in 1993, when he finished tied for third, but well behind the winner Bernhard Langer. So he's not at Augusta. Though he is in Augusta: he's been spotted outside the course, parked up in a van, selling a range of tat which includes C&amp;W CDs and Grip It And Sip It beer mugs, and everything in between. On the subject of Bubba's travails round Amen Corner, here's more from Bull, who is currently being chased along Magnolia Drive by a 16-foot pink 'roach invisible to all other humans, but has still managed to send me this hilarious missive while sprinting along gripping his smartphone. (I assume it's the phone the cockroach is after.) \"You may have noticed that, because Bubba was the odd man over after the cut, the club have paired him up with a 'marker' to keep him company as he goes around. Instinctively, you just assume that the guy they've picked, who is a member who has just sauntered out of the clubhouse at late notice, is going to look a bit of chump when he's being made to play alongside the current Masters champion. Only, this being Augusta, he happens to be rather good. His name is Jeff Knox, and he is a 50-year-old millionaire who holds the course record holder off the members tees - with a round of 61. I've just watched him give Bubba a lesson in how to play Amen Corner, where he went around in par, birdie, par, while Bubba dropped three shots.\" It's pointless trying to keep up with Bubba sometimes. After his meltdown around Amen Corner, where he shed three strokes, he's just got up and down at 15 from the back of the green to register a birdie, then clipped his tee shot at 16 to four feet, rattling in the putt he left himself for another bird. He's bounced back up to +1. He'll have no regrets - he ain't that type - but perhaps he should have here. He'd be bothering the upper echelons of the leaderboard if he'd held it together on 11 and 13! You can't reverse-engineer a sandwich. That's the BREAKING NEWS from Augusta National, a CONTROVERSY which knocks this tedious Tigergate nonsense into a COCKED HAT (from a legal position in the dropzone). This from our man on the spot Andy Bull, who has been up all night under attack from 300 giant cockroaches in Augusta's 69th best motel (of 79) and is understandably letting his concentration wander slightly from the golf. \"ESPN's Wright Thompson has an in-depth exclusive on Augusta's pimento cheese sandwiches,\" he reports, while waving imaginary roaches away from in front of his eyes. \"They've changed the supplier, and now they're getting loads of complaints because people say they don't taste the same. Only trouble is, the man who made them is so pissed off that he's been given the boot that he's refusing to let on what the secret ingredient that made them so good was. The club have hired all kinds of chef and spend all sorts of money to try and recapture his recipe. But they still can't figure it out.\" This might just be the best article you read all year. And you thought all the Masters apparatchiks had to worry about was keeping their pedantic, rule-obsessed television audience happy. Tim Clark's on a roll here. He's just picked up his fourth shot of the day, another birdie at 6. Suddenly he's only four shots off the lead. A decent start for Paul Lawrie, too, with a birdie on 3 bringing him to +1, and a mention for the debutant John Huh, who birdied 1 and 3 and has reached the turn without dropping a shot: he's +1 for this tournament as well. It's going to be calm and sunny all day, according to CBS Television, and 72 degrees if that precise information makes any difference to you. And now Bubba's just bogeyed 13. Oh Bubba! He's back to +3. There certainly don't seem to be too many shots out there, if the travails of the early starters are anything to go by - there are only five players on the course under par for the day - but one man who is tearing it up is Tim Clark, with birdies on 2, 4 and 5. He's -1 for this tournament now, and will be ruing his collapse on the back nine yesterday, when he bogeyed four holes between 11 and 16 on his way to a 76. Here's the official blether from the Augusta mandarins on this Tiger business. Yesterday afternoon, the Rules Committee was made aware of a possible Rules violation that involved a drop by Tiger Woods on the 15th hole. In preparation for his fifth shot, the player dropped his ball in close proximity to where he had played his third shot in apparently conformance with Rule 26. After being prompted by a television viewer, the Rules Committee reviewed a video of the shot while he was playing the 18th hole. At that moment and based on that evidence, the Committee determined he had complied with the Rules. After he signed his scorecard, and in a television interview subsequent to the round, the player stated that he played further from the point than where he had played his third shot. Such action would constitutive playing from the wrong place. The subsequent information provided by the player's interview after he had completed play warranted further review and discussion with him this morning. After meeting with the player, it was determined that he had violated Rule 26, and he was assessed a two-stroke penalty. The penalty of disqualification was waived by he Committee under Rule 33 as the Committee had previously reviewed the information and made its initial determination prior to the finish of the player's round. Anyway, I think I'm going to make a ruling of my own. You may think this is the most outrageous bodyswerve in sporting history since the days of George Best and Gigi Meroni. It may well be. It may not. But unless Tiger decides to withdraw to save himself from hand-wringing pious grief, I'm going to draw a line under the matter, in this report at least. Golf, anyone? Bubba's just double-bogeyed 11, after all. Not a whole lot going on out there so far, with the only notable move being made by the reigning Masters champion Bubba Watson. Bubba did his level best to miss the cut yesterday, needlessly dropping a shot on the 18th green, placing himself at the mercy of leader Jason Day, who couldn't quite rake home the birdie effort on 17 that would have sent him home. But he's still here, scooting around early doors with a marker, and what a round he's having! He opened up with three birdies on the bounce, to move to +1 for the tournament. And now, having got to the turn with a run of pars, he's picked up another on 10. He's level par for this championship. It's almost as if playing at his own, almost practice-round speed - first out, without a playing partner or a field ahead to hold him up - is the ideal working condition for another golfing hero who doesn't take life, or himself, too seriously. Ladies and gentlemen, exhibit 374: \"Let's have fun, let's go through the water hazard ... then drive back across the water hazard. Who doesn't want to do that?\" This high-octane controversy - two days of it in a bleeding row! - is all a bit much for me, tell the truth; I'm just after watching a nice round of golf. Thank heavens, then, for some of the names at the top of the leaderboard, a few gentlemen who take life very much as it comes. Freddie Couples, not quite the oldest, but certainly the smoothest, swinger in town, a man who glides round the course, his swing so relaxed you'd swear sometimes that it didn't actually happen. Angel Cabrera, exuding a quiet, regal air, strutting down the fairways as though he owns them, but not making a big song and dance about it, for he's dreaming of well-seasoned steak and wine. Brandt Snedeker, a devil-may-care swashbuckler whose personal philosophies were summed up marvellously when he stated that \"I love coming over to Europe, the culture and the lifestyle, it really is my cup of tea here\" before leaving a beat, then shrugging: \"I just always play bad, for some reason.\" And of course The Somnambulist, the majestically insouciant Jason Dufner, who after draining a birdie putt on 11 yesterday, one of the hardest holes on the course, flickered not a jot, simply trudging across the green to fetch the ball out of the cup with the air of a pensioner shuffling to the front door to pick up the post, in the full knowledge that most of it will be junk mail. There are many golfing heroes whose victory here this week would put a smile on the face - Jason Day, Justin Rose, Lee Westwood, David Lynn, Adam Scott, Rory McIlroy, Sergio Garcia and Tiger, to name but a few - but a Green Jacket for a Couples, Cabrera, Snedeker or Somnambulist would be just the ticket. It's Moving Day, folks: let's hope the Move is no faster than a Nice Gentle Amble, so our laid-back heroes can be bothered to keep up with the pace. Hot on the heels of the penalty stroke awarded to Tianlang Guan yesterday for the heinous crime of being slightly flustered by adverse weather conditions in an already surreal situation for an inexperienced child, we now awake this morning to another RULES BROUHAHA!!! Yes,Tiger's been judged as taking an incorrect drop on 15 yesterday, in the wake of Lady Luck giving him a full-blooded toe-punt in the swingers by sending a nigh-on perfect pitch ricocheting off the flagstick and back into the drink. He failed to subsequently drop his ball \"as near as possible\" to the spot of the original shot, and so he's been penalised two strokes for the dropping violation. Disqualification was an option - unaware of that extra two-shot penalty, convinced that his drop was legal, he'd signed for a lower score than he'd shot - but that's been waived under rule 33-7/4.5 of CBS Television's the USGA's Big Book of Arbitrary Decisions. He starts his third round back at -1. It's a can of worms, this. Perhaps I should be getting into a righteous froth about it all. Tiger did, after all, openly admit to taking the drop \"two yards away\" in an interview after his round of 71 (which is now effectively a 73, Tiger having \"taken\" 8 on the 15th). But the rule the officials have cited to waive disqualification states that if a player \"could not have reasonably known or discovered the facts resulting in his breach of the Rules\", he can be given a second chance, and a slap on the wrists with the old penalty strokes. Given the weathered state of the drop zone on 15, and that Tiger's drop was pretty much right next to where the initial stroke took place anyway, with no advantage gained, it can feasibly be argued that Tiger thought he was working within the laws, and so this decision seems a fair enough compromise. And in any case, whatever our viewpoint or interpretation may be, rule 33-7/4.5 ensures this is still within the boundaries of the Rules. It is what it is. One thing is certain. If Tiger goes on to win this, the self-righteous grandstanding of those who think he should have been turfed out will be a sight to behold. I'm getting the popcorn in. By the way, there's some actual golf on.
