The fear now is that the bid itself will go the same way after being dealt a severe blow. The fallout from today's covertly taped revelations has the potential to put the other public relations disasters that have bedevilled the bid \u2013 from rows about Mulberry handbags to boardroom infighting \u2013 in the shade. Even David Beckham may not save them this time. Although the new sports minister, Hugh Robertson, is right to point out that it is better this happened now than closer to December's vote, the timing is still grim. Understandably England's Russian rivals appeared delighted. \u2022 David Conn: Triesman a victim of very English coup \u2022 Thompson to lead 2018 bid after Triesman resignation \u2022 Sheepshanks and Burden step into breach at FA \u2022 Russian, Spanish and Portuguese all react angrily From the start the bid was hobbled by petty boardroom infighting but following a concerted effort by Sir Keith Mills and Lord Coe, architects of the successful 2012 London Olympic bid, and a wholesale reshuffle, things had started to settle down following the high-profile resignation in December of the Premier League chairman, Sir Dave Richards, who walked after a perceived slight from Triesman. And while the bid continued to attract negative headlines, it was felt behind the scenes that the chief executive, Andy Anson, and his team were doing a quietly effective job in lobbying the 24 Fifa executive committee members who will decide England's fate. Meanwhile the Beckham factor had helped put public perceptions of the bid back on track as he networked furiously on behalf of the bid at the World Cup draw in South Africa in December. Triesman's departure, and the reasons behind it, put all that at risk. He would often respond to criticism of the bid by imploring the questioner to ask the Fifa executive committee members who will decide their fate for their opinions. What they had to say when 2018 executives frantically called to make amends for their former chairman's reported comments would not have made for pretty listening. Most damningly his comments put at risk relations with the 24 members of the Fifa executive committee whom they had been so assiduously courting. Russia and Spain/Portugal are both well connected in the Fifa corridors of power and will already be seeking to extract maximum gain from England's latest disaster. Triesman has previously come under fire from some of his enemies within the game for not having the presence required to lead the bid. Jack Warner, a controversial and divisive figure in world football, but one of the most powerful of the 24 executive committee members who will decide England's fate, told the Guardian that he \"considered the statement to be ill advised\" but refused to comment beyond that. Whatever the reservations about the way the story was obtained and presented \u2013 with the contents of a covertly taped conversation being used to trap Triesman in a web of his own making \u2013 there is no doubting the damaging impact it will have to England's bid around the world. It is especially damaging because it will be perceived by Fifa, and particularly its president, Sepp Blatter, as confirming existing prejudices about England. From the minute the bid was launched Anson and ambassadors from Beckham to John Barnes have attempted to hammer home the message that England has to earn the right to host the World Cup and drop any vestiges of the arrogance and entitlement that holed the last ill-fated bid, for the 2006 tournament, below the waterline. Triesman, who learned about yesterday's story during the FA Cup final, had said earlier in the week at Wembley that England's reputation for fair play was important. \"When people say to us 'you're all very gentlemanly and play by the rules' I'm afraid I can't take that as a criticism, I would rather people knew we did it the right way and I believe we will succeed from doing it that way. People right around the world want to see it won in the proper way.\" Rightly or wrongly the power and methods of the British press may also make some at Fifa think twice about whether they want seven years of forensic media scrutiny in the run-up to 2018. Yesterday's events will be all the more galling for Anson and his team after they were cheered by the response to recent meetings with Fifa executive committee members and the warm glow that surrounded Beckham's sortie to Zurich to deliver a bid book that promised hundreds of millions of pounds in development money for football around the world. Senior bid insiders claimed today that all was not lost and they would simply have to hope that the storm would blow over. They would have to redouble their efforts and hope that the switch in focus to on-pitch matters for the duration of the World Cup would help their cause. But time is now against them as they head for South Africa a number of high-profile lobbying opportunities ahead of a Fifa inspection in August and the vote in December. Meanwhile Triesman, who came into the FA chairman's job radiating a desire to get things done but has been done for by a combination of his own fallibilities and the dysfunctional nature of the organisation he was appointed to reform, will be left to rue the irony of his final words last week at Heathrow when he returned from Zurich. \"We were told not to talk about other bids \u2026 If I did give a name I would get into terrible trouble and, you know me, I never like getting into trouble.\" He had hoped to leave the FA having reformed the organisation and delivered the 2018 World Cup but, sadly, will exit having done neither."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
