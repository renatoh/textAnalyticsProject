Former counter-terror coordinator Richard Clarke, appearing before a federal inquiry into the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington, said the Bush administration had ignored his repeated requests for urgent action on international terrorism. Mr Clarke, who provoked a White House backlash at the weekend when he claimed that Mr Bush did \"a terrible job on the war against terrorism\", told the inquiry he had been so frustrated by the lack of action that he requested a job transfer. He said he had made a series of recommendations on tightening security and increasing the pressure on al-Qaida in January 2001, but they were not put in place until after September 11. \"They were done - they were done after September 11,\" he told the inquiry panel. \"I don't really understand why they couldn't be done before.\" He said that, before the attacks, the Bush administration \"didn't believe me that there was an urgent problem, or was not prepared to act as if there was an urgent problem\". In comments that were likely to further anger the White House - which has sharply criticised the publication of a book by Mr Clarke on his years as counter-terrorism coordinator - he drew a direct, and unfavourable, comparison with the previous administration under President Bill Clinton. He said that the Clinton administration had \"no higher priority\" than combating terrorists, while the Bush administration made it \"an important issue but not an urgent issue\". Earlier, the director of the CIA admitted that the intelligence services did not act \"rapidly or thoroughly enough\" to close gaps in national security before the September 11 attacks on the US. But George Tenet, who has served as CIA head under both the Clinton and Bush administrations, said both were committed to the war on terror and took the al-Qaida threat seriously. He said there was \"no lack of care or focus in the face of one of the greatest dangers our country has ever faced\", but his agents found it impossible to penetrate the al-Qaida network at the highest level. Crucially, however, Mr Tenet insisted that even if the CIA had tracked down and eliminated al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden before the 9/11 attacks, the attacks themselves could not have been stopped. Outlining the frustrations of the decade-long hunt for bin Laden, who is blamed for the 9/11 attacks and is the CIA's most wanted man, Mr Tenet said he was identified as a key target as far back as the early 1990s. In 1996, as the threat level associated with bin Laden increased following his move to the \"terrorist haven\" of Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, the CIA set up an anti-terror unit devoted to tracking and disrupting his activities. Despite operations and arrests involving thousands of operatives in dozens of states, the US could not penetrate to the core of his network. \"We were taking terrorists off the street but the threat level persisted,\" he said. Even after 1999, when the CIA increased its focus on bin Laden with a \"broad array of resources\" including the establishment of a network of \"terrorist spies\" and collaboration with security services in central Asia, it could not locate Bin Laden with enough precision to launch a cruise missile attack. Asked if, in retrospect, he believed anything could have been done to prevent the attacks, Mr Tenet said: \"I don't believe so. This plot was off and running.. operators were moving into this country. Decapitating any individual - even bin Laden - in this context would not have stopped this plot.\" Mr Tenet said: \"We did not close those gaps rapidly or thoroughly enough before September 11.\" Earlier, the US commission on the 9/11 attacks, which is hearing from key witnesses at a two-day public inquiry, said that CIA efforts to stop bin Laden before the attacks were hindered by confusion over whether intelligence officers were allowed to kill the al-Qaida leader. The CIA also depended too much on Afghan indigenous groups to attack Bin Laden and Mr Tenet understood its chances of succeeding were only 10 to 20%, the commission said in a preliminary report. The commission's findings are to be released this summer and are likely to provide ammunition for both Republicans and Democrats in their autumn election campaigns."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
