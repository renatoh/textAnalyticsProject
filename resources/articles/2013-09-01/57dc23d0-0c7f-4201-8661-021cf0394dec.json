Actually that's not even putting my neck on the line, is it? We need to start thinking logically about this one and acknowledge that all streaks must end. To be honest, it now probably weighs just as heavily on the Geelong players as it does on Alistair Clarkson's men. The Hawks are coming off a week's rest and have been bolstered by the inclusion of star forwards Lance Franklin and Cyril Rioli. Two weeks ago Fremantle took advantage of Geelong's inability to string together four strong quarters and I expect the Hawks to do the same on Friday night. The injuries and dysfunction of Geelong's twin forward towers Tom Hawkins and James Podsiadly have been well-documented in recent weeks but neither can now rely on goal-kicking cover from suspended veteran Paul Chapman. That's a big problem. Some more Steven Motlop or Johnson brilliance is not out of the question, but Harry Taylor has to do something phenomenal up forward for the Cats to be any chance here. The constant sight of Hawks defender Josh Gibson spoiling and rebounding from his defensive 50 is what we can more reasonably expect. This one is Hawthorn's to lose. The Purple Haze \u2013 Are you experienced\u2026 enough? Finals experience counts for something I guess, but I find it impossible to see Sydney limping over the line against the Dockers on Saturday night. It's a shame that the Swans finals charge should be so plagued by injuries, but you can only play with the 22 you send out and this makes the Dockers clear favourites at home. These two sides played out a draw in Round 8 at the SCG and this one will be no walkover, but rested up and full of confidence from their landmark triumph over Geelong two weekends back, Fremantle might just have too many options for Sydney to handle. So how could the Swans pull off a huge upset? Well, Jesse White would possibly need to play the game of his career and the Swans reliable brigade of on-ballers will need to hit the scoreboard in a big way. It's hard to know how the absence of Kurt Tippett will be felt but it remains a possibility that without directing a lot of forward traffic at the hulking spearhead, Sydney could become a little bit more unpredictable. One of Kieren Jack or Dan Hannebery is likely to feel the presence of human glove Ryan Crowley for most of the game so others will need to pick up the slack. Analysing this clash man for man, it's just impossible to tip the Swans. The Dockers should proceed to their first Grand Final \u2013 to miss out would be an unbelievable bust. Trade period is unofficially underway Hope springs eternal, as they say. As every season enters its final weeks talk will inevitably turn to potential player movements and trades and what happens in this period is often more interesting than the season if you happen to follow a cellar-dwelling side. Here are some certainties: St Kilda will chase any half-decent player with a pulse, even if they're under the cloud of an Asada investigation, Collingwood will be aggressive players in all the off-season happenings and the movement of an assortment of recycled bit-players will be the bulk of trade action. The big-name speculation is always fun, don't get me wrong, but for every Buddy Franklin or Dustin Martin there'll be twenty Patrick Veszpremis and Jeremy Laidlers. Of the players already on the look-out for a new home Daniel Cross and Maverick Weller look most likely to get another chance, but a host of other players will be thrown into the mix over the coming weeks. With the Pies set to shed some big names and a reportedly thin national draft pool on offer, now could be the time for a number of clubs to swoop on disgruntled or mismatched players. So who should your club seek to hire and fire this off-season? It's Brownlow speculation time One thing I love about the closing weeks of September is those brilliant \"leaked\" emails that float around containing spreadsheets with a full run-down of the 'Brownlow medal votes'. One season I got one that had Brett Kirk as a runaway winner so it obviously pays to keep your eyes peeled for that potential gold. I actually haven't received any yet this year so lift your game, folks. Fake emails aside it's hard to see anyone other than Gary Ablett taking Charlie home on Monday night, but stranger things have happened. Messrs Selwood, Pendlebury, Swan and Mitchell all remain in contention. As ever the main attention will be the Wags being poked, prodded and spun around like rotisserie chickens during the red carpet intro, which seems to increase in length and hysterical razzmatazz by the year. For veteran players at home the quest to spot ring-ins and howlers has developed into something of a tradition, as has the enduring appeal of any player who gets stood up and takes mum along. If you're a dateless AFL footballer, firstly, you're doing it wrong. But secondly, always take mum. You can hang out with your teammates literally every day of the year, the chance to earn that many brownie points with your mother should never be passed up. Dustin Martin will always be a lightning rod for criticism Dustin Martin's contract impasse with Richmond has gathered pace as the football media's issue du jour, so I think it's time to sit back and look at all of this with the long-view in mind. I'm even going to break with tradition here and give you more blog for your money. I'll start with some questions: Does Martin have a right to be commanding the dollar figures that are being thrown around having been so well remunerated as a rookie? How much of the negative perception of him as a player is solely attributable to factors beyond the 22 year-olds control? Is the behavior of his manager Ralph Carr not almost identical to that of Port Adelaide midfielder Travis Boak in negotiating a lucrative two-year deal in 2012? As with Boak's other contract negotiations in 2010 (when the threat of him walking to the Suns loomed), Port were effectively held to ransom, with a suspected offer from Geelong acting as ample leverage for the Power onballer, who probably wasn't even in the Top 40 players in the competition at that point. Boak now finds himself the captain of a resurgent club and though he never wore the black hat to the degree Martin has, it's worth remembering examples like his when we talk argue so breathlessly about these contract sagas. A collective case of short term memory always seems to obscure certain universal truths about all high-profile player deals. As football fans we cling to a passionate but hypocritical belief; players should prepare and perform with the utmost dedication and professionalism but the minute it comes to negotiating their worth to the club, we expect them to act with the same misty-eyed sense of romanticism as us. In other words we expect them to play like pros and negotiate their contracts like amateurs. It doesn't add up. In Martin's case, league boss Andrew Demetriou even chimed in, lamenting, \"It's a shame because everyone knows he's got ability,\" before adding: \"If you're not prepared to commit to the club, commit to the team. They've looked after him a lot, some other clubs aren't prepared to take the risk.\" Is that not a tiny bit prejudicial to Martin negotiating the best deal that his talents allow? It's hardly the business of league brass to be telling players what contract offers they should and shouldn't accept, let alone making loaded statements that may ward off other potential suitors. The basic message in all of this seems to be, 'we don't like the kind of person that Dustin Martin is and we don't like the kind of people his family and friends are'. This thinly-veiled snobbery and snap judgement of Martin's character has mostly been inflammatory, censorious and pretty unnecessary. After all, Martin's publicly-known indiscretions have been minimal. The consensus is that he's introverted, easily led and tends to fall in with the wrong crowd, but that could also have been said of a lot of players who went on to be champions and upstanding citizens. It has also been implied that St Kilda's insistence that two of its players cancel off-season travel plans with Martin was a damning indicator of his troublesome nature. When we're giving weight to the cultural statements of the St Kilda football club we're probably getting a little bit ahead of ourselves, right? Ditto the interjections from his former manager Ricky Nixon. Have Richmond put effort, care and serious dollars into him? Undoubtedly, but it's not just an act of benevolence on their part, that's just the cost of doing business in this sport. If he'd been just another in the long line of Richmond draft busts, he certainly couldn't have expected much loyalty from the club. Here's another thing about Dustin Martin that we sometimes forget; his upbringing was far from settled and before he even entered the AFL system he'd been working a day job for a couple of years. The kid at least knows what hard work means. That's one of many layers to an obviously complex and unusual character. Swayed by the tattoos, the hair and the jailhouse-themed goal celebrations, sometimes we can all be quick to judge situations that we can't fully comprehend.
