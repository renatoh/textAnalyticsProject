We then danced the Pride of Erin and later on had dinner in the events room of the RSL with my family and friends. I was not a 17-year-old bride, but taking part in the grand Australian country kid tradition of attending my debutante ball. The dress I wore was designed and made for my aunt for her \"deb\" (as we call it) by my Mimi in the 1970s, and worn again by my other aunt on her wedding day in the 1990s. I wore it to my deb in 2005, and it was worn again by my younger sisters to their own balls. Valyrian swords in Game Of Thrones have shorter shelf lives. It was one of the best nights of my life. I went with one of my best mates, got my make-up and hair done (terribly, all part of the tradition), and danced with my father and grandfather, who both declared I was terrible on the dancefloor. To use a sweet and antiquated phrase, it genuinely was part of a \u201ccoming of age\u201d tradition, along with other country rites of passage \u2013 like getting stoned at the campdraft (look it up, city kids) and being caught wagging school by your own principal, spotting you changing out of your school uniform and jumping the fence. These little nods to being completely unoriginal while thinking you are utterly unique see you walking in the same footprints of your parents and your grandparents, which is important. Tradition connects you to those who have come before you and those who will come after you in a way that helps you get perspective about your insignificance in the grand scheme of things. It also provides a great deal of comfort. Of course, tradition can also be narrow-minded and limiting. Kiana Prewett, a fellow country kid, has learnt this in a rather brutal fashion when her school council told her she could not go to the deb with her best friend, a girl. The reason: \u201cit\u2019s not tradition\u201d. Well, some might argue that the true tradition of the debutante ball is to present a teenage girl to society for the first time as she embarks on a series of balls or social outings to find a suitable husband. But I am certain most of the parents at my deb were not hoping for their daughter to be married by the end of the next season. I\u2019m sure that when they were toasting keeping their kids relatively intact for this long and reminiscing about their own deb balls, they were not eyeing up girls as potential partners for their sons, wondering quietly if she really did have the right to wear white. And that would have been true tradition. \u201cTradition is important but at the same time you need to change with society,\u201d Kiana said. It seems like an obvious sentiment, but as always there are still people that need reminding. We take part in traditions to learn something about ourselves \u2013in my case, that I am not very good at the Pride of Erin \u2013 to ease into critical stages of our life and to bind our small communities together. Anthropologist Nelson H Graburn said: Tradition was the name given to those cultural features which, in situations of change, were to be continued to be handed on, thought about, preserved and not lost. But traditions do change, evolve to fit the times, moulded to something we can relate to along with our parents, even if it's not exactly the same. Kiana\u2019s school has relented, as it should. Part of tradition is changing it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
