Every day you worry what to do? What not to do? How to do it? How to change? How to adapt? What can happen tomorrow?\" It has been three and a half years since Van Commenee, 53, took on the job of coaching the British athletics team at their home Olympics. He has always been a control freak, but now he is more aware than ever that he cannot afford to let his attention drift for a moment. Van Commenee did just that recently, when he was out cycling in his home country of Holland. He has two cracked ribs to show for it. Typically he is quick to laugh \u2013 he insists he is amused by the spoof Twitter account (@CharlesVComedy) someone has set up in his name \u2013 but at the moment he cannot, because when he does his chest aches. If Van Commenee makes any similar slips this summer, he can expect another bruising at the hands of the British press. The Dutchman is charming in his way, but he has been so outspoken in his time (athletes who complain about injuries risk looking like \"pussies and wankers\", Twitter is for \"clowns and attention seekers\") that he has no shortage of enemies. His spat with Phillips Idowu is still festering. \"It doesn't matter that I don't have a relationship with him,\" Van Commenee says. \"Not at the distance he is jumping. It's not what you would like with athletes but it is what it is.\" That sums his philosophy up \u2013 so long as his athletes deliver, nothing else matters much. So long as they deliver. Van Commenee describes himself, somewhat egotistically, as \"the public face of athletics\". If his team fail to win the eight medals he has promised the nation, and they will need at least one or two golds among them, then he will take the blame. He has never shirked that fact. And it is worth pointing out that since he took charge the team has met every medal target he has set. But still, he knows some members of the press will be waiting for him to expose a chink so they can slip the knife in. The Daily Mail, for instance, is currently banned from attending all official UKA activities because the British team were so offended by its repeated criticisms of the athletes in the team who were born overseas. After an excruciating press conference in which Michigan-born hurdler Tiffany Porter was grilled over whether or not she knew the words to God Save the Queen, Van Commenee has since checked with all the team's potential medal winners to make sure they can answer that question. \"They know the words. Or they will,\" he says. \"I'm not going to rehearse everybody because we have 90 athletes but people that matter \u2013 let's say the relevant ones, the ones on your radar.\" He says he doesn't even know the words to the Dutch anthem himself, but then in the Netherlands they never got their knickers so twisted about whether their athletes could sing or not. \"It matters,\" says Van Commenee, \"because if they don't [know the words] somebody will make an issue of it.\" Issues. Van Commenee is getting sick of them. He ticks them off one-by-one: the allegation that a \"high-ranking person\" in UKA called Jess Ennis \"fat\", the campaign against the 'plastic Brits', the court of arbitration for sport's ruling on the British Olympic Association's drugs bylaw and the question of Dwain Chambers' eligibility, the coach's row with Idowu, his refusal to let his athletes attend the opening ceremony. \"I know,\" says Van Commenee, \"that in Olympic year all sorts of rubbish comes up.\" Van Commenee insists he put up with worse when he was the chef de mission for the Netherlands at the Beijing Games in 2008. \"This is nothing compared to what I had to go through in preparation to Beijing. It was international then. In the lead up there were lots of issues around Taiwan, Tibet, smog, human rights, not having the ability to express yourself in public, child labour, and all these things had to be addressed by me.\" He was, he says, a little out of his depth discussing such things. The Netherlands were under pressure to withdraw from the Games, and Van Commenee recalls being surrounded by \"a dozen press officers\", all telling him what to say and do. \"This,\" Van Commenee says, \"is nothing compared to these major political issues. Now I represent a sport, but at that time I represented a nation. And those were in my mind serious issues. The issues I deal with now are ...\" Van Commenee catches himself just before he says something injudicious. \"Partly not serious.\" Right now, all Van Commenee wants to concentrate on is looking for the \"fine margins\" that will make the difference to his athletes. He is, by his own high standards, happy with the state of the team. \"I am not carried away because there are one or two months to go, but overall it's looking positive.\" The Aviva Olympic trials on 22 and 23 June, he says, \"are going to be more interesting than in the last two decades probably because there's something to fight for.\" He is particularly excited about the breakthroughs made this season by some of the younger athletes. He singles out the pole vaulter Holly Bleasdale, the sprint hurdler Andy Pozzi and the discus-thrower Lawrence Okoye. It is not all positive. He is particularly bothered by the \"lack of speed in the sprints\" and the injuries in the women's middle distance group. Still, it almost sounds like Van Commenee is enjoying his work. \"I choose to do this job because of the home Olympics,\" he says. \"I could have easily stayed in Holland in a nice job but I preferred this because it is such a special thing to go through, to experience and be part of. So yes, I am enjoying it. The three years leading up to it have been preparation. Now it is business time.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
