Yesterday Culloty withdrew his appeal against a riding ban, and Thornton lost his against a 10-day suspension. Culloty, in particular, misses out on what should be the jewel in the festive crown, the mount on Best Mate in the King George VI Chase at Kempton's Boxing Day fixture. Champion jockey Tony McCoy looks favourite to step in for the ride on Best Mate, and he has the chance of winning a \u00a3100,000 bonus for partnering the winner of all three Grade 1 races on the Sunbury track's biggest card of the year. Culloty rode at Exeter yesterday but left it late before announcing he had reluctantly withdrawn his appeal against a three-day ban imposed by the Doncaster stewards last Friday for \"dropping his hands\" on Beechwood and losing third place in the bumper. He said: \"I have done so because it appears the ban would have been increased to seven days.\" It transpires that the Doncaster stewards should have given him seven days for the offence and if Culloty had lost his appeal his ban would have been increased to a week. Best Mate's owner, Jim Lewis, is delaying his choice of replacement jockey. He said: \"I will meet up with Henrietta and Terry Biddlecombe [Knight's husband] at Uttoxeter and will discuss all the options. I am sorry for Jim, who has done so well on Best Mate. It was a harsh decision to penalise someone for not knocking a young horse about. \"I'm sure Mr McCoy's name will crop up, but it could be that he is claimed to ride Wahiba Sands or Shooting Light for Martin Pipe in the race. I don't suppose it will be a problem getting a jockey, although there are quite a few out on that date.\" Last year Culloty was injured and could not take the ride on Best Mate in the King George. McCoy deputised on that occasion, only to be beaten by Florida Pearl. Lewis said of Culloty: \"It is almost as if Jim is fated. Henrietta has said that she wants a jockey that has ridden Best Mate before, so that narrows it down a bit. We will clearly be wanting to put up the best available.\" In fact Best Mate has only ever been ridden by Culloty or McCoy since joining the Knight stable. The seven-year-old was in demand for the King George again yesterday when his price was clipped to 11-10 from 6-4 with Hill's. Best Mate will face a maximum of 10 rivals. Hill's bet 4-1 Bacchanal, 5-1 Florida Pearl 7-1 Native Upmanship and 9-1 French raider Douze Douze. First Gold has been left in but is expected to run at Leopardstown instead. Thornton failed in his appeal against a 10-day ban due to start on Boxing Day and end on January 6, for taking the wrong course and failing to pull up at Cheltenham a week ago in the cross-country event on Lucky Clover. Both he and Culloty had their appeal deposits of \u00a3400 forfeited. Thornton's explanation that his mount was carried off the course by Trinitro was not supported by video evidence and the Jockey Club's disciplinary committee also pointed to the fact that Simon Claisse, clerk of the course at Cheltenham, had driven the rider around a circuit of the cross- country course the day before the race. Thornton and Culloty will also miss next Friday's Coral Welsh National, in which Best Mate's stable companion Chives will now be partnered by Richard Guest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
