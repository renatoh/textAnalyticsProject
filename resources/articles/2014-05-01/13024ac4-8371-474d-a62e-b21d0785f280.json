The service was contacted by 13,600 people in the latest tax year for help over a mortgage or secured loan, up from 12,800 complaints in 2012-13. However, while the ombudsman service said there was more lenders could do, it said many borrowers were at fault for demanding \"unrealistic\" solutions to their problems \u2013 such as asking for mortgage repayments to be suspended indefinitely or their debts to be written off. Increasing numbers of borrowers concerned about losing their home were in \"debt denial\", and risked leaving it too late to seek help, the ombudsman said. A third of those contacting it with mortgage problems were behind with their payments, the service found and it suggested increasing numbers of people were \"letting the situation get out of hand before seeking the help they need\". Typical areas of complaint ranged from allegations of misrepresentation, suitability or misleading literature, to disputes over valuations, the sales advice provided and the upfront fees charged in cases where no mortgage was eventually offered. Where people were in financial difficulty, the problems concerned issues such as the handling of arrears, the repossession process and the recovery of shortfalls. Around 25,000 people contacted the ombudsman's helpline with questions or concerns about home finance problems, and the service upheld just under a third (30%) of all mortgage complaints. Tony Boorman, the chief ombudsman, said: \"Many of the cases where people face losing their home have been heart-breaking to deal with - but could potentially have been avoided. So if money is tight, you should never be afraid to ask for help or guidance. Speak up sooner rather than later - there's a lot that can be done to help before things get out of hand.\" The service added that \"a large number of people struggling to make ends meet felt unable to say they were facing significant financial problems - or were concerned about the impact of telling their lender of their situation\". It said that \"on many occasions, what the customer was seeking was unrealistic\", but added that at the same time, mortgage lenders needed to take a less \"black and white\" approach to helping borrowers get through difficult times."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
