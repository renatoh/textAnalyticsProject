One imagines that entry into Ronaldo\u2019s gilded world cost multi-Bafta-winning director Anthony Wonke much of the creative freedom that he would usually expect on a project. The film explores the Madeira-born soccer star\u2019s early life, with insights into his unfulfilling relationship with his alcoholic father, who died from cirrhosis of the liver in 2005. We get to see some stage-managed father-son bonding between Ronaldo and the child he had with an unknown mother in 2010. But other aspects of the footballer\u2019s life \u2013 personal relationships, scandals \u2013 remain strictly off-limits. As such, this is for fans only. Unlike Senna, for example, this is not a film that will interest anyone remotely ambivalent about the sport in question."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
