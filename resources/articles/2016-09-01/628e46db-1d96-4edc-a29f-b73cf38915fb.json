Momentum\u2019s founder, Jon Lansman, was speaking on Tuesday night to volunteers taking part in phone canvassing as the leadership contest entered its final hours, telling them that their services would be needed in a general election but also potentially to fend off a fresh leadership challenge from inside Labour. Corbyn and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, later addressed hundreds of volunteers at the headquarters of the Unite trade union as their campaign sought to make 10,000 calls to Labour members and supporters on a \u201csuper Tuesday\u201d of campaigning. While Corbyn gave little away about his view of proceedings at Tuesday\u2019s meeting of the party\u2019s national executive committee \u2013 which failed to reach a consensus over how to persuade MPs to return to his frontbench \u2013 Lansman also told volunteers that there had been \u201csome good, some not so good\u201d snippets of news from the NEC. Lansman didn\u2019t elaborate but one item of agreement to come out of the NEC was that it would have two new members with full voting rights from the Scottish and Welsh executives. Corbyn\u2019s allies had wanted the Scottish and Welsh representatives on the NEC to be voted on to it by members. In a meeting that lasted more than eight hours, the Labour leader also refused to sign up to plans put forward by his deputy, Tom Watson, under which Labour politicians would be allowed to vote for the shadow cabinet. McDonnell told volunteers manning the phone banks at the Unite offices that they should be \u201ccareful\u201d about the outcome of the leadership contest on Saturday. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be tough \u2026 to meet the levels that we got last year and I say that because they have thrown everything against us,\u201d he added. He added that there would be a call for unity after Corbyn won. \u201cWe have already got members of the PLP [parliamentary Labour party] coming back, which is great. And what is wonderful is that the new generation is coming forward, which is what Jeremy is all about.\u201d Lansman also sought to manage expectations, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what Saturday\u2019s result will be but let me reassure you we have booked a party.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
