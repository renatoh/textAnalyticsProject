There are four Premier League clubs in the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time since 2009 and, while the actual number of English players involved in that success might be relatively small, the upside for Gareth Southgate when international football returns on Friday is the ability to select one of the most potent forward lines available to anyone attempting to reach next year\u2019s European Championship. Injury permitting, England should be able to field Tottenham\u2019s Harry Kane, Manchester City\u2019s Raheem Sterling and Manchester United\u2019s Marcus Rashford against the Czech Republic at Wembley and for the trip to Montenegro, a trio of goalscoring forwards all in top form for their clubs. It is true Sterling and Rashford are behind Kane in terms of scoring goals for their country, though both are enjoying the sort of Manchester seasons that suggest they can be more than just support acts as England look to build on the progress made last year. \u201cWe\u2019ve got more than three forwards but what I can say about the three we\u2019ve played in our last few matches is that they all have the same mentality,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThey all want to be the best they can be, they all feel they can be among the best in the world and that\u2019s brilliant. It\u2019s hugely exciting when you have three attacking players of that quality as well as alternatives in Jesse Lingard, Dele Alli and Jadon Sancho. \u201cThere\u2019s more players I could name actually. Whenever we bring the squad together the training is really intense because of the competition between players. That is exactly what you want and need. If we are going to continue to improve and constantly be hitting semi-finals and possibly finals, we\u2019ve got to handle expectations. To do that you need players who are going to step up, players who aren\u2019t satisfied with where they are and want to get better.\u201d Captain Kane is the model professional who sets the standard for others to follow, even though Sterling has a dozen more caps. Sterling is, in fact, the second most experienced player in the present squad with 47 caps, one behind Jordan Henderson. The fact a 24-year-old is so close to a half-century of caps seemed to come as a surprise even to Southgate. \u201cIt\u2019s phenomenal to be his age and already on that number of caps,\u201d the England manager said. \u201cRaheem\u2019s still got huge possibility ahead of him, so goodness knows how many he will end up with. But, if his performances continue as they have with his club this year, then his future is extremely bright. \u201cHe was a fundamental part of us getting to a semi-final last year; he was always in our first-choice team. We thought he made a huge contribution and that\u2019s why we kept on playing him. The only bit missing from his game were goals, which came in the autumn. I think the game in Spain was an important one for him, because two goals on a really big stage will only have improved his confidence.\u201d Rashford\u2019s confidence has also surged as a result of Manchester United\u2019s revival and a more regular role under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, though Southgate believes he was making good progress in any case. \u201cFor a 21-year-old I thought his minutes for his club were fine really,\u201d he said. \u201cI was never worried. I know he wasn\u2019t always first-choice at United but, if you looked over the period of the season and the number of European matches as well, he was getting more minutes than most kids of his age, so we were happy with his progress. We always felt he would be an important player for us. I remember working with Marcus with the under-21s. From the very first day you knew you were looking at a top player, someone with the desire to improve his technique and be as good as he can possibly be, and I haven\u2019t seen anything to change my mind about that. I haven\u2019t seen any lowering of standards.\u201d Kane, Sterling and Rashford should all get the chance to let their quality shine through on the international stage this year, either in the Euro 2020 qualifiers or the last four of the Nations League (remember that?), in Portugal in June. There is quality and youthful promise right through the squad \u2013 with perhaps a slight area of concern over the lack of goalkeeping experience \u2013 though the front end of the team is what inspires confidence. Southgate thinks so, at any rate. \u201cYou sometimes look at other countries and what they are doing, and then you have to try and look back at ours in the same way,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we look at the options we\u2019ve got we think: \u2018OK, if I were playing against us I would be worrying about that area of the pitch in particular.\u2019\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
