The striker was introduced as a 74th minute substitute and, moments later, he capitalised on an error by the Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer following Santi Cazorla\u2019s free-kick to scramble home the opening goal. Neuer misread the flight of the ball and it hit Giroud in the face before appearing to go in off a hand. Mesut \u00d6zil added the second deep into injury time and the result means that Arsenal remain alive in Group F, even though Ars\u00e8ne Wenger said that his team would most likely need something from the return fixture at Bayern\u2019s Allianz Arena in two weeks\u2019 time. \u201cI\u2019ve had a bit more luck than in recent weeks, so I\u2019m making the most of it,\u201d Giroud said. \u201cFor a striker, it always works in cycles and I know that. You can\u2019t start doubting yourself. All the qualities are there \u2013 I just needed a helping hand from destiny, and tonight it worked out in my favour. It\u2019s certainly not my most beautiful goal but it\u2019s one of the most important.\u201d Bayern hogged 69% of the possession and they created the chances to have got something from the tie but they came up against Petr Cech in inspired form. The Arsenal goalkeeper, for whom this was a first Champions League appearance for the club, made four important saves \u2013 including two in the second half from Robert Lewandowski. Wenger was heavily criticised for preferring David Ospina in the previous tie; the Colombian made a dreadful handling mistake in the home loss to Olympiakos. Ospina was ruled out here with a shoulder injury, which meant that Wenger could restore Cech without any loss of face and he was rewarded with a commanding performance. \u201cCech was very important \u2013 he kept us in the game, and you can say the same about Neuer,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cYou had two top world-class goalkeepers on the pitch. It was vital on both sides.\u201d Neuer had pulled off an incredible reflex save to keep out Theo Walcott\u2019s close-range header in the 33rd minute but he erred badly for Giroud\u2019s goal. \u201cIt was my big mistake that led to Arsenal\u2019s first goal,\u201d Neuer said. \u201cI think a draw would have been a more appropriate result.\u201d Pep Guardiola, the Bayern manager, paid tribute to Cech for a \u201creally good performance\u201d but he was at a loss to understand how his players had not converted any of their chances. \u201cI can\u2019t explain why we didn\u2019t score,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cSometimes, you have chances but you don\u2019t score. It\u2019s a mystery. In general, we controlled their amazing counterattack but in the Champions League you have to be perfect in all points. We weren\u2019t and we lost the game.\u201d The only disappointment for Wenger was the right hamstring injury that forced Aaron Ramsey off in the 57th minute. The midfielder pulled up in obvious distress after a short sprint and it would be a surprise if he were not ruled out for a few weeks, at least. \u201cHe is very down because he told me that his hamstring is quite a tough one,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cHe\u2019s out.\u201d Wenger added: \u201cYou never know if you will win the game but you know that the team focus and dynamic was there. We were not at our level of focus for the first two games [against Dinamo Zagreb and Olympiakos] because we always focus on the Premier League but tonight, we needed what we show in the Premier League. \u201cThis can strengthen our belief and the belief of the people around us. We need a result at Bayern in our next game but let\u2019s focus on Everton in the league on Saturday.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
