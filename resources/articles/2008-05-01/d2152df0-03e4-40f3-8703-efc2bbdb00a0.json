His relationship with Rio Ferdinand is excellent. When Vidic attacks the ball and marks his opponent tightly, Ferdinand covers his back. No matter how much confidence you have in your colleague, the first rule of a good defender is \"distrust and cover\". With Drogba almost certainly playing a lone role, Vidic can afford to get tight and compete physically. If the forward runs away down the channel in a spinning movement, the Serbian can be confident that Ferdinand will close that space. In midfield, Michael Carrick has to shield the ball played in to Drogba's feet. Vidic has great spring and can cope with balls crossed from wide positions. Drogba will interrupt his run, trying to get across the blind side of his marker. The forward also enjoys higher, longer balls down the middle. If he is in the mood he will battle and scrap. Vidic's concentration must be spot-on. Cristiano Ronaldo v Ashley Cole If he proves his fitness after last night's scare, Cole has the problem all full-backs face when the Portuguese runs with the ball: show him inside and he can cut in and shoot with great power; show him outside and he can drag cover out of position. Cole has enough speed to cope with Ronaldo - so does his potential replacement, Wayne Bridge - but he must prevent him turning and facing him with the ball. Ronaldo can put the quickest full-backs on the back foot. Whenever the opportunity arises the left-back will try to get forward. He boasts excellent delivery in the final third - at Arsenal, with Robert Pires in front, his storming runs always caught the eye. Joe Cole, though less swift than Pires, is cleverer and offers movement inside from the left. Ronaldo will try to call his marker's bluff and hang out, anticipating the quick counterattack. If he does not receive constant supply he will switch positions, being equally comfortable in a central berth. Don't expect the full-back to follow him. He will merely pass on the headache. Paul Scholes v Frank Lampard This pair set their teams' rhythm. By his standards Frank Lampard's form has probably slipped slightly since his golden year two seasons ago when he drove Chelsea to the title with magnificently flighted, direct and accurate passing beyond defenders. But there is still so much to admire. United must be aware of his movement; after he has passed the ball he always seeks space. His movement leaves space for Claude Makelele or Ballack, and Lampard senses when to continue his run into the box - he must be tracked at all times. He moves stealthily, to arrive late and pounce. Scholes will sit and pull the strings. He can ping the ball at will, particularly to his wide players. Chelsea must force him away from feeding Ronaldo. Scholes plays the crossfield pass that stretches defences with speed, the ball arriving before full-backs can get tight on the player coming off the cover. In the past, Scholes would hit the box regularly as he searched for a header, and he is outstanding in the air for a small man. These days he sits deeper and conducts the orchestra. Scholes, with Carrick, may set the tempo but Chelsea will hustle early to destroy any hint of fluency. The Londoners will hope they can drag United's wide players in to defend. They must not concede midfield control."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
