Liam Byrne, the shadow work and pensions secretary, is to demand cross-party talks on the issue. In a speech he will argue that Labour needs to know what is going on because it may be forced to make tough decisions on restricting benefit payments if it wins power in 2015. Some of the government's plans to slash the welfare state could cost more than they save, Byrne will claim. Labour has calculated that the total bill for botched policies and waste will be \u00a31.4bn by the end of this parliament \u2013 the equivalent of \u00a3245 for every working-age benefit claimant in Britain. The Tories dismissed the calculations as \"laughable\". \"Over the last month it has become crystal clear that the so-called revolution is in very, very serious trouble,\" Byrne will say in the speech at the children's mentoring charity Chance UK. Shadow cabinet members are under pressure from Labour grandees to start spelling out their policies more clearly. Lord Prescott, a former deputy prime minister, has urged Ed Miliband to sack senior colleagues who are not pulling their weight in a reshuffle next month, amid criticism they have been silent over the summer holiday. Frontbenchers appear to have responded by sending out more announcements about their policies in recent days, but Chris Bryant, a shadow immigration minister, was heavily criticised for having to retract criticism of Tesco and Next over their use of foreign workers last week. Byrne's speech, titled Fiscal Discipline in Social Security, is likely to be taken as a hint that Labour is gearing up to accept many of the coalition's welfare cuts. He will pledge to \"bring social security spending under control\". \"If we are going to turn our economy around, protect our NHS and build a stronger country, we will have to be laser-focused on how we spend every pound,\" he will say. In a sign of Labour's new approach, Byrne is expected to refer to \"social security\" rather than \"welfare\", as the party tries to shake off Tory claims that it is too much on the side of benefit claimants over working people. Labour has already signalled its intention to cap overall benefit spending, end winter fuel payments for the richest pensioners, tighten the rules on some benefits for foreign workers and maintain restrictions on child benefit for wealthier families. Miliband has said the coalition's welfare cuts will be a \"starting point\" that cannot be reversed without savings elsewhere, but promised an approach to benefits that will restore the \"dignity of work\". The focus of Byrne's speech will not be challenging the substance of reforms brought in by Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, but criticism of his failure to deliver them properly. Labour said the biggest cost would come from the government's probable failure to meet its targets on the youth contract, which pays employers to hire young people. The government is projected to miss its aim of subsidising jobs by 92%, meaning 147,940 more young people on the dole at a cost of \u00a39m a week in 2014. The party said another large extra cost was caused by universal credit, a scheme to make sure people get all their benefits in one lump sum. Labour said this would need \u00a3300m in 2015 as the project had been hit by delays and IT problems. \"Universal credit was once a flaship, now a sinking ship,\" Byrne will say. \"If we don't fix this mess, millions of families' tax credits will be put at risk \u2013 along with billions of pounds of taxpayers' money.\" Labour also pointed to fraud and error costing \u00a3140m, the \u00a3119m cost of extra benefits caused by an under-performing welfare-to-work programme, and an additional \u00a3102m to implement the bedroom tax \u2013 cuts to housing benefit for households with spare rooms. It said tribunals related to people challenging cuts to their disability benefit would cost \u00a3290m. Byrne will also call on ministers to impose a deadline on the healthcare company Atos to \"turn things around or lose its contract\" for assessing disability benefit claims. However, an aide to Iain Duncan Smith dismissed Byrne's claims as laughable and said the coalition's reforms overall would shave \u00a383bn off the welfare budget. She said the speech was a \"last-ditch attempt by Liam Byrne to keep his job in the shadow cabinet\" before Miliband's reshuffle next month. \"Labour is panicking \u2013 after a summer of discontent, here is yet another disastrous speech, void of any ideas,\" she said. \"Same old Labour is in the wrong place on welfare. They want people on benefits to make more money than the average hard-working family earns.\" As part of a point-by-point rebuttal, the aide said the \u00a3300m for universal credit did not reflect extra costs but was simply the scheme's allocation for 2015. She said plans to cut housing benefit for families with spare rooms would get extra cash but this would be spent on helping the most vulnerable people affected by the reforms, which have been demanded by Labour. The extra \u00a3140m of waste was simply the total lost to fraud and error over the last two years, with a similar amount missing annually under the last Labour government, she said. On the youth contract and work programme, the aide said it was \"ludicrous\" to say that failure to get unemployed people into jobs equated to additional spending on benefits. A spokesman for Atos said its contract with the Department of Work and Pensions was first awarded in 1998, renewed for seven years in 2005 and extended for three years in 2010 through to 2015. The company said its reports were a reason for successful appeals in only 0.3% of tribunal cases."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
