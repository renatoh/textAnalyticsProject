On Wednesday the management board of Gaz de France (GDF), the state-owned gas group, is due to set in train plans to sell off some 30% of its equity in a placement, likely in May, that could net between \u20ac5bn and \u20ac6bn for Jacques Chirac's government. Areva, the French nuclear plant builder, which is being touted for an eventual merger with a sister division at Alstom, the engineering group rescued by the government last year, and which is valued at \u20ac11.5bn, is also expected to place a third of its capital in May. According to French press reports, the government could raise up to \u20ac10bn in total this year, including a further sell-off of France Telecom and the jewel in the crown of the energy sector, the electricity group EDF. The state raised \u20ac8.8bn last year, \u20ac2.5bn in 2003 and \u20ac6.1bn in 2002. Herv\u00e9 Gaymard, the successor to Nicholas Sarkozy as finance minister has yet to give the green light for the EDF transaction as the group, which has profitably bought up large swaths of the British energy sector, has complex problems associated with its nuclear liabilities, pension deficit and a stake in Italian counterpart Edison. But, with a 30% stake likely to be sold off during a planned capital-raising exercise later this year to buttress its European expansion, EDF could fetch as much as \u20ac20bn gross for a government that has promised the EU it will cut its deficit to 3% this year from around 3.5% in 2004. The French placements alone promise to be huge money earners for investment banks such as Merrill Lynch and Lazard which are acting as advisers to GDF and Areva but are running into stiff resistance from unions led by the communist CGT, which has called for a merger of EDF and GDF instead. The banks are also preparing a key role in sell-offs planned for this year by Hans Eichel, the embattled German finance minister, who has pledged to bring his country's budget deficit to 2.9% after it reached 3.7% in 2004 - the third year in a row it broke the EU stability and growth pact's mandatory limit. Mr Eichel, who is holding talks with Mr Gaymard in Berlin today, could raise between \u20ac19bn and \u20ac24bn, or more than the proposed budget deficit, by selling off more stakes in Deutsche Post, Deutsche Telekom and other assets via transfers to the state-owned Credit Agency for Reconstruction (KfW). By the end of this month the government will have sold off 92% of the postal business, netting \u20ac8bn in the past four years, including \u20ac1.7bn this month, and wants to reduce its majority stake in Telekom -though the latter's share price has been languishing at around \u20ac20 after reaching a peak of more than \u20ac100."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
