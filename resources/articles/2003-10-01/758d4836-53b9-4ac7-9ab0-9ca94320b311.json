Like the England international, Carter is an outside-half by preference but Mitchell, England's assistant coach when Wilkinson made his debut in 1998, is playing him in the centre for experience. \"Jonny played most of his early internationals at inside centre and it takes the pressure off a young player by providing him with experience inside and outside him,\" said Mitchell. \"It will be the same with Daniel. He is the up-and-coming Jonny Wilkinson. There are a lot of similarities between them, not least work ethic and a fierce will to get better and better.\" The 21-year-old will assume goalkicking duties against Canada after landing six out of eight conversions against Italy last Saturday. \"Jonny Wilkinson is a world-class player and I am not in his bracket - not many are,\" said Carter. \"He has firmly established himself in the international game, but I still have it all to prove.\" Carter will be facing a Canadian team that acknowledges it has no chance of winning. \"We are on mission impossible,\" said Canada's captain Ryan Banks. \"It is a question of keeping the score down.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
