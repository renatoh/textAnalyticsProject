Then he went to play golf. The president, the White House pool reporter wrote, appeared for the motorcade to his course in Sterling, Virginia \u201cwearing white Maga cap, windbreaker, dark slacks, non-dress shirt, shoes that look appropriate for golfing\u201d. Trump\u2019s dedication to playing golf while in office has been a source of continuing controversy \u2013 particularly because he memorably and repeatedly lambasted his predecessor, Barack Obama, over how often he played the game. Trump has defended his dedication, tweeting this summer: \u201cMy \u2018exercise\u2019 is playing, almost never during the week, a quick round of golf. Obama played more and much longer rounds, no problem.\u201d Media organisations have factchecked Trump\u2019s claims, pointing out, though counts vary, that he has played many more times than Obama did at any similar point while in office. According to the pool report, on Saturday the presidential motorcade passed \u201cmore Biden/Harris signs than Trump/Maga signs\u201d while a protester near Trump National Golf Course held a sign which said: \u201cGood Riddance.\u201d In an echo of a famous incident early in Trump\u2019s presidency, when a Virginian on a bike offered him a middle finger, one local reportedly offered Trump a thumbs down. The cyclist who gave Trump the finger, Julie Briskman, lost her job over the incident but later beat a Republican to win local office. On Saturday, Trump was on the course when a statement was released in which he pointedly did not concede defeat. \u201cWe all know why Joe Biden is rushing to falsely pose as the winner,\u201d said a man who has claimed to have won 18 golf club championships, which the golf writer Rick Reilly called \u201ca lie that\u2019s so over-the-top Crazytown it loses all credibility among golfers the second it\u2019s out of his mouth\u201d. In his statement, Trump went on to make baseless and evidence-free allegations of voter fraud and ballot irregularities, as he has since election day. Trump\u2019s partners on the course were not immediately known. After he finished playing, he posed for pictures with a wedding party using the club. Joe Biden, the Democratic challenger whose election victory was confirmed shortly after Trump reached the golf course, also plays the game. In 2015, Golf Digest put him among \u201cWashington\u2019s top 150 golfers\u201d with a 6.3 handicap. \u201cShould he become commander-in-chief,\u201d the magazine wrote, \u201cput him in the conversation with John F Kennedy as the best golfing president in history.\u201d The magazine also reported comments in 2012 by the former Ohio governor John Kasich, a Republican, that though \u201cJoe Biden told me that he was a good golfer, and I\u2019ve played golf with Joe Biden \u2026 I can tell you that\u2019s not true, as well as all of the other things that he says.\u201d Doubts about Biden\u2019s true handicap pale by comparison with widespread reporting of Trump\u2019s behaviour on the course \u2013 which allegedly includes rampant cheating. \u201cDonald Trump is the worst cheat ever and he doesn\u2019t care who knows,\u201d Reilly told the Guardian in 2019, of a man he has known for 30 years. \u201cI always say golf is like bicycle shorts. It reveals a lot about a man. And golf reveals a lot of ugliness in this president.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
