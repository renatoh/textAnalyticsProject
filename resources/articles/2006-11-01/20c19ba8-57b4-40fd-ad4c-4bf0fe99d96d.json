Every week, sometimes twice, two friends and I covered ourselves in fake blood, dressed up in silly outfits and pranced around on Channel 4 burbling enthusiastically about computer games. It is to my present self's dismay that that behaviour has resulted in a self-imposed retreat from pubs at 10pm, as I've learned that after then the tongues of early 21st-century terrestrial TV viewers loosen with alcohol and people feel compelled to talk to me. Not that I mind particularly; I've come to terms with my celebrity, but personal debauchery has been put aside for fear that if I'm recognised, I'll be held accountable for my actions. The reason I bring up this mosey down memory lane is that I'm about to take part in a return to regular broadcasting, albeit via a far more diffuse and less well-produced channel. The Gamesblog team is starting its moblogging and I get to join in. I'd better get my hair cut. Using the Nokia N-series' Lifeblog feature, we'll video gaming events, interviews with interactive luminaries, hands-ons with new hardware and various how-tos, and we'll post the results on to the Gamesblog (blogs.theguardian.com/games). At one point we discussed making an episodic film filled with witty repartee, but we'll see if that comes to pass. While we can't promise Oscar-winning performances, we can promise that there will be no fake blood. You can video your responses, but don't send them to The Guardian's site - instead you can post them on YouTube, which is where our guardiangamesblog channel is located. (Note: we're not the same as the \"gamesblog\" user, which is an Italian site: we are at www.youtube.com/profile?user=guardiangamesblog. In fact, it's imperative that you do. This is the new form of citizen journalism; now, instead of shouting at us via the blog, you must create well-reasoned arguments and film yourself saying them. Which comes to the real reason we're doing this: we want to see what our readership looks like. If we can't be anonymous any more, why should you be? It's the modern media environment, so claim your right as consumers to give back as good as you get. Personally, I'm looking forward to putting faces with pseudonyms, particularly those who give us a hard time. The video blogs will go up at least once a month, and the first instalment, arguably technologically better than Jeremy Paxman's first attempt and hopefully less cringeworthy than David Cameron's (www.webcameron.org.uk) is on today's Gamesblog.
