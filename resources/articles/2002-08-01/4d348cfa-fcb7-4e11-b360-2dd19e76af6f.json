Not since his state funeral in 1965, an event widely seen as marking the decline of Britain and the fall of its empire, has the reputation of Sir Winston Churchill stood so high. The boom reverberates and the image proliferates, from the Champs Elys\u00e9es to the Oval Office. The iconoclasts - John Charmley, David Irving, Clive Ponting, etc - have been eclipsed by the latest, pro-Churchillian biographers, Geoffrey Best (excellent) and Roy Jenkins (over-rated). In the television film The Gathering Storm (fine as drama, flawed as history), Albert Finney gave us the best impersonation of Churchill ever screened. At least two TV documentaries are on the stocks, one by the accomplished makers of Britain at War in Colour, and the other in the BBC's \"Great Britons\" series, where Churchill came top of the poll. The electronic catalogue of the Churchill Papers (held at Churchill College, Cambridge) is now available on the internet, and it is fostering a huge increase in academic work on the man and his age. Churchill shrines such as Chartwell and Blenheim have never been more popular. Bletchley Park has just opened an exhibition centre. A new Churchill museum is being created at the cabinet war rooms. The Havengore, the barge that took Churchill's coffin down the Thames to the dipping of the dockers' cranes, has recently been restored and is set to become a Churchill study centre. And now David Cannadine has bound together this sparkling miscellany of essays with a sombre Churchillian tag. It hardly succeeds in making his book a homogeneous whole, despite highly ingenious special pleading. In the preface, Cannadine says that the essays were \"undertaken interconnectedly\" and that they are concerned with the history of the last two centuries in \"varied but related ways\". Of course, everything can be connected - candle ends and toasted cheese. And there is an obvious sense in which all his pieces refer to Britain's vanished supremacy simply because this has been the crux of our island story since Victorian times. But it's rather a stretch to relate, say, James Bond to Gilbert and Sullivan, or No\u00ebl Coward to the history of parliament, or the National Trust to the Chamberlains' Birmingham. There is also a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu about these jeux d'\u00e9sprit. Penned for different occasions over the past decade or so, they have all appeared before in one form or another. Cannadine states that they have been \"thoroughly revised\". But not enough to eliminate every slip: the United States did not declare war on Hitler but vice versa; Churchill did not share a \"social circle\" with Chips Channon and Emerald Cunard; Sir Garnet Wolseley is spelt thus. Nor enough to refer to Mike Leigh's definitive film treatment of Gilbert and Sullivan. Nor enough to rein in his exuberant verbosity - Cannadine will write \"limitations, inadequacies and shortcomings\" where one word would do. Still, one mustn't look a literary gift-horse in the mouth. These essays are wonderfully interesting and entertaining. Probably no historian writing today combines Cannadine's panache, erudition and wit. If he recycles his work in this way, which in his last book of essays (History in Our Time) he vowed to do no more, it is eminently worth rereading. If he is loquacious, he is also spell-bindingly eloquent. And if his pudding lacks a theme, it is chock-full of plums. Cannadine is particularly good at relating architecture to ambience, at showing how dumb stones speak volumes about the attitudes of those who build with them. The changing cityscape of Birmingham, for example, reflected Joseph Chamberlain's transformation from radical liberal with republican leanings to royalist imperialist Boer war-monger. Its apotheosis occurred in 1901 when Council House Square was renamed Victoria Square, complete with a statue of the Queen. Still more illuminating is Cannadine's account of the Houses of Parliament, a version of which he broadcast on Radio 4's \"The Westminster Hour\" with Andrew Rawnsley. When rebuilt by Pugin and Barry after the fire of 1834, the Palace of Westminster was not designed to project a democratic character in the wake of the great Reform Bill. It was a Gothic theatre in which crowned, robed and sceptred monarchs, nobly assisted by ermine-clad peers, engaged in majestic pageants while the Commons, provided with inadequate seating and poor acoustics, played the audience. Furthermore, as parliament changed its nature, becoming more imperial, more democratic and finally more parochial, it continued to pander to nostalgia for a feudal past by staging increasingly anachronistic costume dramas. Cannadine anatomises this process with a scalpel, exposing a deep vein of flunkeyism in the English character. But whether Westminster will continue to disguise the realities of power or whether it can adapt itself in order to reflect them, he does not presume to judge. Where he judges most acutely, though, is in assessing the polar opposites of modern British political history. He examines the antithesis between the respectable traditionalists, as epitomised by the baggy-suited Baldwin, and the messianic egotists, as embodied in that well-groomed trinity, Joe Chamberlain, Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher. With his pipe, his rustic pose and his emollient views, Baldwin seemed to personify orthodox Englishness. He had a Burkean reverence for the past. He managed to identify one-nation Toryism with patriotism. He invented the fireside chat long before Roosevelt, and his relaxed, intimate mode of speech, a kind of anti-oratory, inspired trust. By contrast, the members of the trinity were ruthless, intolerant, outspoken, obsessed with enemies within and without, and quite ready to hijack the Conservative party for their own fell purposes. They all loved a fight - something that Jenkins failed to bring out in his eminently respectable portrait of Churchill, and something that proved supremely important in 1940. In particular, Churchill's rhetoric, the subject of the most cracking essay in this book, was brilliant but unsound. It sometimes contained glittering but misleading phrases, such as \"soft underbelly of the Axis\". It was frequently too brutal, crude and doom-laden. It often sounded, says Cannadine, with a characteristic flurry of adjectives, \"false, flatulent, bombastic, histrionic, overblown\". Yet, as he acknowledges, Churchill's chief weapon, almost his only weapon, was his tongue. And he used it to incomparable effect when he became prime minister, articulating the feelings of his compatriots in sublime language. \"The drama of the time had suddenly become fully equal to the drama of his tone\", and he \"talked his way to immortality\". What the trinity also shared was apocalyptic fears about the decline and fall of Britain. Chamberlain spoke of \"the weary Titan staggering beneath the too vast orb of his own fate\". Churchill struggled to prevent the liquidation of the empire and, having failed, said that his life had \"all been for nothing\". Margaret Thatcher's central aim was to \"reverse national decline\". In fact, Britain's Victorian pre-eminence was largely accidental, and the country's relative decline was inevitable. Moreover, far from involving the triumph of barbarism, it was accompanied by absolute growth. Losing an empire was certainly a traumatic process and finding a role is hardly less so, especially as Churchill casts such a long shadow. But, as this stimulating book shows, in order to beat out a future we need to confront the past."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
