The call centre in Manchester is to be established by the Rail Passengers' Council under an initiative called Passenger Voices, which will centralise the handling of complaints across the rail network, taking the job away from regional committees. It is to be run by Ashley Grumble, presently a customer liaison manager at the train company First North Western, who will manage a team of five staff. The bill for setting up the office will be \u00a3400,000 and running costs will be a further \u00a3700,000 a year. But critics have pointed out that the RPC only gets just over 7,000 complaints a year - which means answering each query will absorb \u00a3100 of public money. David Redgewell, a campaigner for the pressure group Transport 2000, described the scheme as \"a ridiculous waste of money\". He said it was a mistake to take complaints away from local officers. \"The last thing passengers want is yet another remote call centre. If they have a problem they want to speak to someone with local knowledge.\" Complaints to the RPC have been steadily falling from a peak of 18,771 in 1999. Most passengers raise grievances directly with train operators and contact the RPC only if they fail to get a satisfactory response. An RPC spokeswoman said the council intended to encourage travellers to complain more often: \"As soon as we go out and promote the accessibility of the RPC, we will get more contact from passengers. It's naive to believe that we won't see some increase in complaints.\" She said a national centre would create more consistency in the handling of complaints and she pointed out that the office's set-up costs included spending on new phones and computer systems for use across the RPC. The shadow transport secretary, Damian Green, said it was \"not obvious\" that the project was worth the money: \"This is a pretty strange priority to have at this stage of the railways' development.\" In a white paper on the railways last month, the government backed a shakeup of the RPC. The consultative council got \u00a35.9m of public money last year but has been criticised for lacking muscle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
