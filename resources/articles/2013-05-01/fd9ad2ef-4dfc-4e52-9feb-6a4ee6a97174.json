Culture If the first thing that pops into your head when you hear the name Wagner is Germanic opera cycles rather than 1980s TV staple Hart to Hart, the Wagner 200 festival gets under way on 22 May at the Royal Festival Hall with events every day for a week (and more later in the year). Books If you think the smallest thing to come out of Germany was former international midfielder Thomas H\u00e4ssler then you probably watch too much football so head over to the Courtauld Gallery, which has just put on display the snazzily titled Dess Alten Testaments Mittler: Dess Neuen Testaments Mittler, two thimblesque German bibles each about 4cm tall. Song and dance Cabaret singer Max Raabe is performing with his Palast Orchester on the eve of the final at Shepherd's Bush Empire, and promising \"classics and newly discovered songs from the Weimar era\" (though he also does a surprisingly good 1920s-themed version of Salt-n-Pepa's Let's Talk about Sex). If a German singer interpreting American rap about sex isn't enough for you, on 28 May chanteuse Ute Lemper will be interpreting Mexican poetry about sex at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. Accommodation At Euro 96 the German side were based at the Mottram Hall Hotel near Wilmslow, Cheshire, where they shocked fellow residents by using the sauna while fully disrobed. If a trip up north is a bit inconvenient, fans could instead visit the Landmark Hotel on Marylebone Road, where the team stayed before the final (and where Bayern stayed when they played Arsenal in this year's quarter-finals). Assuming Bayern return there, however, anyone who wants to look round might be faced with insurmountable security issues, particularly given the high-profile lapse in 1996, when a tabloid journalist managed to sneak into the swimming pool and place towels on all the sun loungers. Fashion If anyone leaves their lederhosen at home replacements can be found at Swann's Way, near Earls Court, which stocks a full range not just of traditional leather trouserwear but also of dirndls for the ladies. History From 23-25 May the German Historical Institute in Bloomsbury Square is hosting a conference: The Ethics of Seeing: 20th Century German Documentary Photography Reconsidered. On the downside, there's got to be a decent chance that some sessions may be almost life-threateningly consciousness-endangering. On the plus side, some of the photographs they reconsider may be of football. Art In need of more food for thought? Head to Belgrave Square, home to both the German embassy and Fritz Koenig's sculpture Great Flora L, and consider whether the latter works, as intended, \"as a fragile 'call-sign' in the heart of the surging metropolis\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
