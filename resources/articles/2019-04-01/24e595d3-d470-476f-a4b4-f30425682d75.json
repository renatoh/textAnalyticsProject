There are wide disparities in spending per child in different parts of England with more than a third of areas seeing a real-terms fall in spending on these services. This is despite soaring demand and increased government funding for children\u2019s mental health nationally, the study by the children\u2019s commissioner for England found. Experts said early intervention by school nurses, counsellors, drop-in centres or online support services to address low-level conditions can prevent them developing into more serious illnesses. And the report warned children may be losing out at this crucial point. Researchers used spending data from local authorities and NHS clinical commissioning groups, which each contribute roughly half of funding, to calculate that local areas allocated \u00a3226m for low-level mental health services in 2018-19 \u2013 just over \u00a314 per child. But while local authority spending per child in London was \u00a317.88, it was just \u00a35.32 in the east of England. According to the study, a few very high-spending areas mask a larger proportion of low-spending areas. The report\u2019s findings showed the top 25% of local areas each spent upwards of \u00a31.1m while the bottom 25% spent \u00a3177,000 or less. Spending per child was higher in London and the north-east, lower in the East Midlands, east of England and south-east. Urban areas were slightly better off than rural regions. The total reported spend across all areas increased by 17% in real terms between 2016-17 and 2018-19. While most areas (58%) enjoyed a real-terms increase in spend per child over the same period, more than a third of areas (37%) saw a real-terms fall, often because of reduced local authority investment. Anne Longfield, the children\u2019s commissioner for England, said: \u201cIt is extremely worrying that a third of local areas in England are actually reducing real-terms spending on these vital services. \u201cThe children I speak to who are suffering from conditions like anxiety and depression aren\u2019t asking for intensive in-patient therapeutic treatment, they just want to be able to talk to a counsellor about their worries and to be offered advice on how to stop their problems turning into a crisis. \u201cThe NHS 10-year plan has made children\u2019s mental health a top priority, but it won\u2019t succeed unless children with low-level mental health problems are offered help quickly and early.\u201d Longfield acknowledged the financial pressures on local authorities, whose budgets have been slashed by government austerity policies, but added: \u201cThose who are spending barely anything on low-level mental health cannot continue to leave children to struggle alone.\u201d Chair of the Local Government Association\u2019s children and young people board, Anntoinette Bramble, said: \u201cChildren\u2019s services face a funding gap of \u00a33.1bn by 2025 while public health services, which also help children get the best start in life, have seen cuts of \u00a3700m. If we are to improve provision of preventative and early-intervention services then it is vital the government adequately funds these in the forthcoming spending review.\u201d A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said investing in children\u2019s mental health was a priority for government. \u201cWe are transforming services through the NHS long-term plan \u2013 backed by an extra \u00a32.3bn a year \u2013 so that 70,000 more children a year have access to specialist mental health care by 2020-21. \u201cEarly intervention is vital and we\u2019re going further, piloting a four-week waiting time standard for treatment, training a brand new dedicated mental health workforce for schools across the country, and teaching pupils what good mental and physical health looks like.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
