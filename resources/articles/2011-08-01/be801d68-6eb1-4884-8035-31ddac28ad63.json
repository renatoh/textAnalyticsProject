The 28-year-old's finish was breathtaking, with a last half-lap of 25.2sec, and he was given a standing ovation at the end of his last race before the world championships in South Korea. \"Today was just to see where I am, to try a different strategy and go hard at the end. I wanted to go out with one lap to go,\" said Farah, one of only two Britons to occupy the top spot in the world rankings this year. \"In Daegu I'm definitely going to give 110 per cent in the 10,000m and then see what happens. I'll see how the legs are, then go for it in the 5,000m.\" Farah may have been the first man to cross the line, winning in 7min 40.15sec, but he was also the last man to leave the track. Just as he did after winning in the Diamond League in Birmingham, the Somalia-born Briton followed his coach Alberto Salazar's instructions to the letter, executing a high tempo cool down under the floodlights, his long legs lapping the Crystal Palace track again and again, long after an ecstaticcrowd had left. For that has become the philosophy for the man who has risen from 17th in the world last year over 10,000m, and 13th over 5,000m, to No1 over both distances under Salazar's training regime. \"It's just pure hard work and graft, nothing is easy, I just keep training. You have to make sacrifices.\" After the world's fastest man this year, Asafa Powell, withdrew from the meeting with a strained groin, it was left to the world's other fastest man, David Rudisha, to put on a show in the 800 metres. The world record holder from Kenya certainly did that, easily beating Steve Cram's 25-year-old all-comers' record for the fastest 800m on British soil as he crossed the line in 1min 42.91sec. The son of a Masai warrior and 1968 Olympic silver medallist, Rudisha went head-to-head with Abubaker Kaki of Sudan for the first time this season and recorded a significant victory before the world championships. Rudisha may have nailed the ability to record fast times but the one accolade he really longs for is a major gold medal. \"It was a very important win,\" said the 22-year-old. \"To beat Kaki is very important as it's a few weeks before the world championships. I'm feeling in good shape ... I knew I was going to break this record.\" Besides Farah, a handful of other British performances impressed, boding well for the nation's chances at the world championships. Jenny Meadows ran a season's best of 1:58.61 in the 800m, storming the final bend and comprehensively beating Jamaica's Kenia Sinclair. \"I know I'm definitely in my best shape,\" Meadows said, who won bronze at the last world championships. \"I knew Kenia Sinclair would be the athlete to watch having won quite a few Diamond League races this year so my aim was to be in the top two,\" said the 28-year-old. \"To take the victory surpassed my expectations. It is out of this world and gives me great confidence ahead of the worlds.\" Meadows won her first UK title at the trials last week and seems to be peaking at the right time. Now all that the world silver (indoor) and bronze medallist needs is a major title. \"I'm very aware that [UK Athletics head coach] Charles [van Commenee] wants me to win some gold medals. I'm gradually becoming a little bit more comfortable with that and believing in myself a bit more.\" Chris Tomlinson finished second behind the world leader, Australia's Mitchell Watt, in the long jump. After pulling out of the trials with a minor injury last week, Tomlinson posted a distance of 8.30m \u2013 5cm short of the British record he reclaimed from his rival Greg Rutherford last month. Andrew Osagie finished fifth in the 800m, the fast pace pulling him all the way to a personal best of 1min 45.36sec to secure his place in the British team travelling to Daegu. Osagie had won the UK title but still lacked the A-qualifying standard time of 1:45.40. The teenage sprinter Jodie Williams made her debut appearance in the Diamond League series and was disappointed with her seventh place in the 200m \u2013 her final race of the season. The 17-year-old felt that the result vindicated her decision not to go to the world championships. Despite dipping beautifully for the line, she lacked the power to rival the senior athletes, finishing in 22.95sec. \"I think this proves I should not be there. I'm just not ready for it. Grenada's 18-year-old James Kirani blew away a world-class 400m field to post 44.61sec \u2013 the fastest time in the world this year and announce himself as a major threat for the one-lap title in Daegu. Kirani, who ran a remarkable 46.96sec aged 14, beat this year's Diamond League leader Jermaine Gonzales as well as the European champion Kevin Borlee. Britain's Martyn Rooney disappointed, finishing last with a time well outside of A-qualifying, leaving Van Commenee with only B-standard athletes to choose from for Daegu."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
