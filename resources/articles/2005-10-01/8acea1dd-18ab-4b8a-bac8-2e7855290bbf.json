It was inevitable that Montgomerie would drop down from the heights he touched in his brilliant course-record equalling round of 65 on the Old Course at St Andrews on Friday. And so it proved as he ventured onto Kingsbarns, the most exposed of the three courses being used for this tournament. But he emerged with a one-over-par 73, not bad in the blowy conditions though bad enough to see him plunge from the overnight lead down into a tie for a distant second place behind Kenneth Ferrie, a northerner who was tearing up the Old Course in much the same way that Montgomerie did on Friday. Ferrie, who backed into the European Open title at the K Club in July ahead of Montgomerie, was six under par for the day with two holes of his round remaining and had opened a six-stroke lead over Montgomerie and Henrik Stenson. Stenson, the tall Swede who is becoming one of the longest drivers on tour - he hit some of nearly 400 yards at the Seve Trophy - was having no such trouble at Kingsbarns and completed a seven-under 65 to show Montgomerie what was possible as he pulled level with the Scot. Montgomerie was even on the right side of a bit of good fortune on the 15th hole, where his ball finished 25 feet away from the flagstick. Before he could address it, the wind caught hold of it and blew it towards the flag, stopping some six feet short. After calling the referee to ensure that there was no hint of a penalty as he had not addressed the ball, Monty missed the putt through what he said was a lapse in concentration. But at least he could acknowledge that the fates had been on his side. 'If it had blown the other way, it was in the ocean. At least it blew towards the hole,' he said. 'It was a very difficult day.' Montgomerie knows he will need a repeat of Friday's heroics when the final round is played over the Old Course today. 'In fact, I'll to do better than that. I'm six behind already,' he said. But all in all, the player who once shot 84 in strong wind at Carnoustie and who matched that score in the 2002 Open Championship at Muirfield, has to be pleased with his performance this week. On Friday his demonstration of ball control in the conditions evoked outbursts of euphoria from his partner in the pro-am section of the event, movie star Michael Douglas, who considered it a privilege to be present for Monty's masterclass. 'It was a magical experience,' the awe-struck Douglas was moved to say. It showed a mastery of the Old Course that Montgomerie has spent 17 years trying to achieve, for over that time he has never missed a Dunhill Cup or a Dunhill Links event here, as well as a few Opens, including this year's second-place finish behind Tiger Woods. 'At the Open this year I finally felt I was beginning to be able to get round,' he explained. 'I used to make mental errors round here but I'm not making them now.' As the afternoon wore on, Pierre Fulke of Sweden and Ricardo Gonzalez of Argentina had joined Montgomerie and Stenson on eight under par, but Ferrie was still well in control as he neared the end."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
