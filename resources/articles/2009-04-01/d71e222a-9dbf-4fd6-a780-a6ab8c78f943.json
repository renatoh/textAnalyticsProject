Then he dropped his voice to a conspiratorial growl: \"Arsenal fans, apparently.\" In those days all things connected with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's outfit assumed a demonic intensity in Ferguson's mind. David Dein, their vice-chairman, was the Mephistopheles of Soho Square, bending the Football Association's agenda Arsenal's way. It stretched credulity to imagine the Manchester constabulary asking arrested troublemakers on the night of the Tyson mismatch: \"Name? Address? Which team do you support?\" To the United manager, though, the Gunners and their emissaries were a vast plot fanning across the land to destroy his work. Cut to today's Champions League semi-final first leg between the Premier League's longest-serving managers and we see something closer to the Auld Alliance, formed by Scotland and France to thwart the English. One theory is that Ferguson and Wenger stopped throwing dung across the north-south fence around the time Arsenal ceased to be a threat to United in the Premier League, which Wenger's teams have not won since 2003-04, the year of the Invincibles (played 38, won 26, drew 12, lost none). Since Wenger authored that masterpiece, Arsenal have finished second, fourth, fourth, third and fourth again (probably), and Ferguson has marched on to deal with two new threats. The first was the snatching of ex-Soviet state assets and their reconfiguration as a rich London football club by Roman Abramovich, and the second is a resurgent Liverpool, whom Ferguson thought he had consigned to history's wheelie-bin when he ended the Anfield hegemony in the early 1990s. Another, more interesting, explanation for the Auld Alliance's rebirth is that Ferguson and Wenger started to realise there was more to unite than divide them. In this scenario, the feud was stopped by Chelsea, not the two managers, who saw a common enemy in Abramovich's wealth. Compared to this menace, a ding-dong between Martin Keown and Ruud van Nistelrooy was a mere playground scrap.Plus: both Arsenal and United adhere to one guiding principle. They aim to spot, acquire, cultivate, protect, educate and finally unleash young talent who can recite the core philosophy, which is to attack, and to attack beautifully whenever they can. Self-regeneration is a religion at both institutions. Wenger has offloaded a host of senior streetwise Arsenal players on the basis that he could invent new ones at a lower cost in his own laboratory. Since the Busby Babes, United's ethos has been that the club should manufacture its own legends on the training fields of The Cliff and now Carrington. Not necessarily Salford lads any longer, but boys from Brazil, Portugal or Serbia, just as Wenger scouts largely in Africa, Spain and France. Senior figures at Old Trafford will tell you that Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is a non-runner to take over because he could not be trusted to extend the Busby-Ferguson legacy of youth-elevation. Ferguson revived the Matt Busby spirit. He saw there was a Manchester United way that had fallen into disrepair. At its heart was self-expression. Wenger was not the pure aesthete he is now. In the years up to and including the Invincibles, Arsenal were warrior-artists and red card connoisseurs. It seems hard to believe now, when we look at the north London butterfly collection, but the combative streak imbued by George Graham and updated by Wenger was one of the prime sources of conflict between the two dictators who will direct tonight's Old Trafford show. To control is Ferguson's lifelong compulsion. Players, staff, journalists, match officials: he seeks dominion over them all. But he could never control Wenger, or relate to his ascetic aura, or his detachment from the macho, drink-sharing customs of the manager's room, as exemplified by Sam Allardyce's lament at finding Rafa Ben\u00edtez absent when he called on him after the Liverpool-Blackburn Rovers game for a man-to-man libation. \"People who do know him tell me he is a good man but I don't suppose I'll ever find out for myself,\" Ferguson said in 2003. \"He seems to pull down the shutters when you meet him and he never has a drink with you after the game.\" Around the time they were stuck in a cycle of mutual contempt, Ferguson is said to have referred to Wenger as \"old vinegar face\", which expressed his bafflement at the Frenchman's disinclination to be one of the chaps, or geezers, or blokes. Wenger's professorial loftiness was received by Ferguson as an affront, perhaps his Glaswegian working-class sensibilities are still sufficiently raw for him to rise up when he feels he is being condescended to. Privately, Wenger would surely admit to probing these insecurities. \"His weakness is that he doesn't think he has any,\" he once joked. \"Everyone thinks they have the prettiest wife at home\" \u2013 a harmless remark about which of the teams played the best football was reconfigured as a decorum-trashing attack on his rival's dear Lady Cathy. At that time, every look and word was a provocation, as it is now, largely, between Ferguson and Ben\u00edtez. Only rarely could it be said that Ferguson had disrupted Wenger's intellectual equanimity. He did in 2004 when Wenger said: \"He does what he wants. I will never answer questions any more about this man.\" This man's ex-nemesis has always made the game look like an artistic calling in which emotion manifests itself mostly as frustration, irony or disdain. Ferguson is an equally brilliant thinker but is more volcanic from hour-to-hour and is quicker to use emotion as a sledgehammer to tighten his control. A safe bet is that even when their dealings were punctuated with animosity they could never quite escape an underlying sense of admiration and respect, because United and Arsenal are alternative versions of a single impulse: to swarm the opposition with agility, pace and skill. They both seek a higher form of a sometimes ugly game. Both require that a player has the physical and mental courage to demand the ball, or to be willing to receive it in the most unpromising circumstances, if it is for the good of the team. When he was asked yesterday about mounting pressure on Wenger earlier in the season, Ferguson said: \"That's the cynical world we're in now. Don't forget, people had me at the door three years ago. Bloody hell, they had in me in a Bath chair down on Torquay beach! So it's a cynical world we're in, I'm afraid.\" Ambition and austerity play a part, because an Arsenal or United player who ambles about, like David Ginola, say, when their team is going backwards is identifiable within minutes, and is duly shamed, and most likely ejected, though there have been times when Dimitar Berbatov's languor has challenged the United orthodoxy. When they are finally off the Premier League's ghost train of propaganda and hysteria, Wenger and Ferguson may yet pitch up together to the kind of function Wenger would instinctively hate (a League Managers' Association golf day plus cabaret, for example) and the two may gravitate towards each other in the clubhouse, before one says: \"Hey, we showed them, though, didn't we? We showed them how to play.\" And then Wenger will finally have that drink."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
