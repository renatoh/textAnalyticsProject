In comments that go against Theresa May\u2019s longstanding approach, the home secretary, who is among a crowded field hoping to succeed her, said he would loosen the current rules, which restrict overseas students to six months of work after finishing their studies. \u201cI want to see more international students come to our country,\u201d Javid told an event in London organised by the thinktank British Future. \u201cIf they\u2019re coming here, studying in our great universities, if they want to work afterwards we should make it easier for them to stay and work, and not say, you\u2019ve got to go back home, just for the sake of it. We need a more positive attitude to this. I think the country would welcome this.\u201d Javid reiterated the point in an article for the Financial Times, writing: \u201cIt makes no sense to send some of the brightest and most enterprising people in the world straight home after their time here.\u201d His announcement has been welcomed by Jo Johnson, the former universities minister who is seeking to amend the immigration bill to change the six-month limit back to its previous timeline of two years. In a tweet, Johnson said he was delighted at the move, calling the planned change a \u201creal win for UK soft power\u201d. At the British Future event, Javid reiterated his intention to scrap the Conservatives\u2019 long-standing \u2013 and never met \u2013 official target to limit annual net migration into the UK to the tens of thousands. \u201cI\u2019ve already said I would not have the target,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think it\u2019s nonsense to set a target that you\u2019re never going to meet. Also it should be led by what you think the country needs, and that changes over time as well.\u201d He spoke more broadly about the benefits of immigration, and how he felt that the control over numbers following Brexit could change public attitudes. \u201cI think it\u2019s been fantastic for Britain,\u201d Javid said. \u201cI think we\u2019d be a much worse society today \u2013 I don\u2019t just mean economically, but I include that, and culturally, every way \u2013 if we didn\u2019t have the approach to immigration we\u2019ve had of successive governments over the last few decades.\u201d He added: \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about being obsessed about the overall numbers, as long as the number is controlled by your own government, about what you feel it needs.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
