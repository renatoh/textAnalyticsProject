Bill Gaines, Professor of journalism at the University of Illinois, who led the four-year study by a team of 60 student researchers, claimed Mr Fielding fits all the characteristics of the mystery figure who exposed President Richard Nixon's dirty tricks campaign against his political opponents. Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein described the events that brought down the Nixon adminstration 31 years ago in their book, All the President's Men. \"There's very little that we do not connect with him,\" said Prof Gaines. As assistant to Nixon's chief counsel, John Dean, Mr Fielding was in a position to observe the cover-up of the 1972 break-in at Democratic party offices in the Watergate building without being accused of taking part in the conspiracy himself. Mr Fielding was also one of very few people aware of several \"important, closely held revelations\", Prof Gaines said. He knew about crucial conversations, helped inventory key documents, was shown specific FBI reports and prepared important White House staff for court testimony. Prof Gaines said the case was based on extensive examination of 16,000 pages of FBI documents and other Watergate records. \"Everything that we have, we show there's a document. It's not interpretation, it's not guesswork. If it wasn't Fielding, I don't see how it could have been anybody else.\" After Nixon resigned in 1974, Mr Fielding went on to be the chief counsel to Ronald Reagan and serve as a member of the Bush-Cheney transition team. He is currently a member of the national commission on terrorist attacks. Professor Gaines, who has twice won the prestigious Pulitzer Prize winner for investigative reporting, said he had presented Mr Fielding with the evidence but had not received a response. Mr Woodward and Mr Bernstein have said they will name their source only after the death of Deep Throat. The journalists recently sold their notebooks and papers related to the story for \u00a33.2m to the University of Texas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
