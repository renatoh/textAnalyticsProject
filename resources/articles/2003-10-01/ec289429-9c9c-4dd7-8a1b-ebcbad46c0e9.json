If they are found guilty it will almost certainly mean the end of their careers. Grau, who played for Saracens, and the Castres prop Reggiardo are both 33 and were considering retiring from international rugby after the defeat to Ireland. The minimum suspension they could expect is 12 months and it would cover all levels of the game. They will appear before the judicial officer, Bruce Squire QC of New Zealand, at a date to be determined. The Argentina squad were in Adelaide yesterday waiting to be told when they would be flying out after failing to qualify for the quarter-finals. Grau and Reggiardo were called to account by the citing commissioner in Adelaide, Douglas Hunter of Scotland. \"The two Argentina props have been cited for alleged dangerous play,\" Rugby World Cup Ltd said last night. The pair have been charged under law 10.4(k), which concerns \"attacks on the eyes\". The Ireland prop Reggie Corrigan was heard on the referee link complaining that he had been gouged after 55 minutes, losing a contact lens as a result. \"An incident occurred and I was not happy about it,\" said Corrigan, who had to be replaced. Keith Wood, the Irish captain, also reeled away from a ruck in the 59th minute holding his left eye. Ireland's coach Eddie O'Sullivan did not make a complaint to Hunter. \"You could not see what happened from where we were sitting and it is just a matter of whether anything was caught on camera,\" he said. Grau was charged with gouging during the opening match of the 1999 World Cup against Wales but was found not guilty. He received a three-match suspension for punching. It is believed the Argentina management were upset that at least one Irish player was not cited for foul play. Ireland were today due to announce their team to face Australia here on Saturday but they delayed it to allow players more time to recover, with Victor Costello and Kevin Maggs unable to train because of leg injuries. The Australia coach Eddie Jones expects Ireland to play with more freedom than against the Pumas. \"That was a game they had to win and it was old-fashioned grunt and grind,\" he said. \"They will throw the shackles off against us. It will be our hardest match so far.\" Jones said he still considered England favourites for the tournament, despite their close call against Samoa. \"I thought the English were outstanding,\" he said. \"They remain the team to beat.\" Meanwhile the Wasps hooker Trevor Leota, who pulled out of the Samoa squad because he would have lost \u00a325,000 in wages, has volunteered to replace the injured prop Jeremy Tomuli. \"He said he was available if we needed him for our game against South Africa on Saturday but it may be too short notice,\"said the Samoan RU chief executive Phillip Muller."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
