Employees were being failed by the government, employers and regulators, with current laws insufficient to protect workers and often not available to them in practice anyway, according to a report from parliament\u2019s women and equalities committee. It calls on the government to introduce a duty on employers supported by a statutory code of practice. Government, regulators and employers had been \u201cdodging their responsibilities\u201d for far too long, said Maria Miller, the Tory MP and committee chair. \u201cIt is utterly shameful that in 2018, unwanted sexual comments, touching, groping and assault are seen as an everyday occurrence and part of the culture in many workplaces,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is currently little incentive for employers to take robust action.\u201d According to a YouGov survey, 52% of women aged 18 to 24 say they have experienced unwanted sexual attention in public places, and 38% have experienced unwanted sexual touching. Reported sexual offences on trains and tubes have more than doubled in the past five years. Research from the TUC and the Everyday Sexism Project suggests half of all working women \u2013 and two-thirds of young women \u2013 have been sexually harassed at work. Miller compared the lack of action taken to prevent sexual harassment with the focus on protecting personal data and anti-money laundering measures \u2013 where companies are forced to adhere to strict requirements. \u201cIt\u2019s time to put the same emphasis on tackling sexual harassment,\u201d she said. \u201cThe burden falls unacceptably on the individual to hold harassers and employers to account when they will already hesitate to do so due to fear of victimisation. The current system is inadequate: the tribunal system must provide an effective remedy for employees.\u201d The report also said employers must protect interns and volunteers and prevent harassment by third parties, such as diners in a restaurant. Campaigners and unions have accused the government of chipping away at employee rights that protected them against harassment. In 2013, the government introduced employment tribunal fees, which were later stopped following a legal challenge, and scrapped a legal requirement for employers to protect their workers from abuse by third parties such as clients or customers. The report also calls on regulators, such as the Equality and Human Rights Commission, to spell out what action they will take against employers who fail to protect their workers. And it recommends that current laws need to work better for workers - calling for employees to be given more time to submit a claim (currently only three months) and the introduction of \u201cpunitive damages for employers\u201d who fail to protect them. Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, welcomed the report. \u201cWe are delighted to see the committee agree with Fawcett that we need a new statutory duty on employers to prevent harassment,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only way we can change workplace culture is to make it a proactive requirement. We have to move from treating this issue as a problem for the individual woman to deal with, to one that the organisation owns.\u201d The report also called for a \u201ccleanup\u201d of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) \u2013 which should be required to use plain English \u2013 and making it an offence to misuse an NDA. \u201cNDAs have their place in settling complaints, but they must not be used to prevent or dissuade victims from reporting incidents as is clearly the case now,\u201d said Miller. \u201cWe expect proper regulation of NDAs and that any unethical practices lead to strong and appropriate sanctions.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
