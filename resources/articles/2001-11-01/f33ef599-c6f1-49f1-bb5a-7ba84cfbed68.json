It's ridiculous to label Campbell a failure after a few months but he's clearly not found his best form at Highbury. He's looked a little heavy-legged, which means his decision-making is not as sharp as it should be. But even if lack of fitness has contributed to his slow start, it's worth remembering that it can take time to settle. When I took Bryan Robson from West Bromwich Albion to Manchester United, only on one or two occasions in his first six months did he hit the form he showed in the latter part of his career there. One of his best first-season performances came at West Brom, where he got treatment similar to the sort Campbell will face tomorrow. Robbo scored in a 3-0 win and Campbell will hope his return to White Hart Lane stirs his Arsenal career in the same fashion. Campbell will have needed time to get his mind settled after his summer move and sometimes it's harder for a defender to fit in than a striker. A lot of a striker's work is instinct, whereas a defender's is done more in a unit. It hasn't helped Campbell that he's been in an ever-changing unit at Arsenal. If he'd gone in with Lee Dixon, Nigel Winterburn and either Tony Adams or Martin Keown it would have been far easier. The whole back line has changed and looks far from steady. Injuries have also hampered Campbell. He didn't play from April last season and has had hamstring problems this term. He's missed matches and really hasn't got started. He looks as if he could do with a lot more fitness. I wonder how good a pre-season he had. If players get through pre-season well it carries them into the rest of the campaign. Otherwise it can take until Christmas to get going. As a big lad, Campbell probably needs that fitness more than most. His lack of edge was obvious against Panathinaikos last month. He didn't deal with a cross properly, looked a bit laboured getting off the ground and had a scratchy header which the Greek team scored from. I still think Campbell is in Sven-Goran Eriksson's thoughts as the main man to partner Rio Ferdinand in the World Cup. The only way he can come out is if he doesn't come up to scratch in the next six months. But in his present form he wouldn't have been picked if it hadn't been for what he's done in the past. Some of Campbell's best performances have been for England. I think he played better at France 98 than I've seen him play in the Premiership. Some say his distribution's not the best but if I have any doubts about his game it's his ability as a stopper. He has lapses in concentration which should be helped by playing alongside Keown and Adams at Arsenal. His determination tomorrow will be increased by abuse from Spurs fans. He'll be nervous but it might be the right type that keeps him on his toes. Today and tomorrow morning will be difficult, with the expectancy and the attention focused on the game, but once things start he'll be fine. I know the sort of stick he'll get, from going back to Sheffield Wednesday shortly after I left to manage Aston Villa. There was all the Judas talk and a lot had been stoked up, but it blew over quickly. Beforehand we'd laughed and joked about it. When we arrived on the coach my assistant, Andy Gray, said: \"I'm not going too close in case anyone's got a repeater rifle.\" All the boys were cracking jokes: \"Gaffer, you got your tin helmet on?\" I was first off the coach. There was a police escort and when someone tried to push in I just ignored it, put on a big smile and walked in as if I owned the place. We were soon two down, and that was the crowd's enjoyment. My enjoyment soon followed when we came back and won 3-2. I don't think Campbell deserves stick. In my book he did nothing wrong in moving to Arsenal. He served 10 years at Tottenham and it seems incredible he should be branded a scoundrel when he gave them such service. Spurs fans would be better off tomorrow employing their energy to do something positive for their side."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
