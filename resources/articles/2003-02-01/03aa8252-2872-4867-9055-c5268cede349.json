Its remarks come as the BBC admits it needs to make a number of major changes to its rolling News 24 channel in the wake of a critical government report into the service. The report, written by former Financial Times editor Richard Lambert, was critical of News 24 and said the channel was not distinctive enough to justify its licence fee funding. In its formal response to the criticism, sent to the department of culture, media and sport late last month, the BBC promised to improve its regional and international coverage, develop interactive services, reduce the volume of pre-recorded shows and better cross promote the channel on BBC1. But, in a clear dig at its competitors, it hit back at criticism it is often beaten to breaking news stories by Sky News and ITV News. In a swipe at Sky in particular, which has led the condemnation of the hundreds of millions of pounds spent on the BBC channel since it launched in 1997, the BBC said that it was \"essential to be accurate as well as fast\". \"The BBC's reputation for authority would be badly damaged if News 24 broke news that was not true, as has occasionally happened on other channels,\" it said. \"We will not compromise our standards of accuracy and so our determination to be first and right will mean we sometimes have a higher threshold for breaking news or a more detailed checking process than our competitors,\" it added. BBC insiders said Sky News has made several mistakes in its rush to be first with breaking news, including leading with the death of five US soldiers in Afghanistan during Allied attacks on Kabul - a story that later turned out to be untrue. BBC staff are also angry that Sky is perceived to be faster with the news when the BBC scooped its rival on several major stories in the past month. These reports, claimed the BBC, include the closure of Gatwick's north terminal due to a terror alert, the verdict on the England cricket team's decision not to go to Zimbabwe, last week's interest rate cut and the stabbing to death of a policeman in Manchester. Nick Pollard, head of Sky News, dismissed the BBC's swipe at rival channels as \"spin\". \"It obviously suits the BBC to try and deflect the criticism in the Lambert Report by suggesting that they are the careful tortoise to Sky's careless hare but it just doesn't wash. Sky's accuracy, as well as its speed, is praised by viewers, critics and regulators alike,\" he added. The response is also critical of the report's assertion that the BBC governors did not do enough to hold the corporation to account. The Lambert report noted that News 24 apparently took little of the governors' time - it only had four mentions, and these were cursory, in the published minutes of its board meetings. \"For a channel that has so far cost around \u00a3220m, and which at one stage threatened seriously to weaken the reputation of the BBC as a news organisation, these comments seem perfunctory,\" the report said. Today the BBC reveals the news channel was in fact discussed in 15 board meetings between 1997 and 2001 and was the subject of \"vigorous\" debate. The admission will confirm suspicions that the BBC's pledge to be open and more accountable by publishing the minutes of the monthly meetings of the board of governors is mere window-dressing and that it actually keeps all but the most anodyne remarks out of the public domain. However, the BBC acknowledges more could be done to make the service more distinctive and to define the service as having a \"broadsheet\" agenda distinct from those of its rivals. It has pledged to give News 24's international coverage \"more impact\", admits it needs to \"do better still\" with its regional coverage and confesses its business coverage needs to be \"clearer about the audience we are serving\". The Lambert report strongly urges the BBC to improve the interactive service on News 24 and the response contains a seven-point plan, including launching a version on cable and Freeview \"as soon as possible\". In an effort to defend the channel against charges that it is expensive to produce compared with its rivals, the BBC plans to provide an annual breakdown of the channel's costs. This will separate out the cost of newsgathering that is shared between all BBC channels and the amount allocated to News 24."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
