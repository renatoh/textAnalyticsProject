Rob is hoping his parents are going to come round to the idea before his wedding to Simon, to embrace it and show the same interest and involvement as they did for his first wedding, to a woman. I have my doubts; Steve and Linda don\u2019t seem the types for sudden enlightenment. Steve has further evidence that his son is not \u201ca genuine gay\u201d. \u201cWhen he was growing up, he used to bring some cracking birds round, didn\u2019t he? Really big-chested ones.\u201d Linda nods in agreement. Rob is a builder, a big, strong builder \u2013 strong wrists, walks like a fella, cracking birds/things, big chests \u2026 we rest our case, your honour. Our son \u2260 a gay. (That indefinite article \u2013 a gay \u2013 is important. It shows what we are dealing with here.) They play the generation card: it wasn\u2019t like this in their day, but they\u2019re only in their early 60s. And look at Simon\u2019s mum: on board, involved, delighted her son has found someone he is happy with and in love with. No, I\u2019m afraid, Steve and Linda, you represent the prejudice in Channel 4\u2019s Bride &amp; Prejudice. Silly title, that, and not just because there isn\u2019t a bride in this case. It should have been discarded. The programme is more interesting than that. It explores a variety of intolerances within families. Rob and Simon\u2019s case is probably the most common here, a straightforward inability to understand same-sex relationships. In Colchester, Shaaba and Jamie, appear to be very well suited and very much in love. Like Rob and Simon, they also have a video of the question being popped. Is that a thing now, proposal videos? Did they do it because they knew it would be useful, for when they went on telly? Anyway, Shaaba\u2019s family is from Mauritius. \u201cMy mum has always had a very set idea of what she wanted for me in terms of my relationship,\u201d she says. \u201cSomeone of the same culture and preferably someone who was Mauritian. Someone who was brown, basically.\u201d Jamie is white, basically. \u201cIt\u2019s not the dream I\u2019ve ever wanted for my girls,\u201d says Shaaba\u2019s mum, Fai. Wait, though, because there\u2019s more. What\u2019s this clear gel that Jamie is rubbing into his skin? Testosterone. Jamie was born into a female body and now he is putting that right. He was six months into transitioning when he met Shaaba. Guess what? Fai\u2019s not happy about that, either. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me \u2026 this isn\u2019t happening,\u201d was her reaction to the news. She would have been so much happier if her daughter were marrying someone not only of the same colour, but also someone the same gender as they were expected to be when they were born. Get with the times, lady. Finally \u2013 because this kind of show always needs three case studies (that\u2019s the rule) \u2013 to east Yorkshire, where Dee, a 24-year-old politics student is marrying local councillor John. John, Dee\u2019s first serious boyfriend, is 59, 35 years older than she is. That\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with here: mind the gap. Dee\u2019s grandad Paul who is only eight years older than John and who was a father figure to Dee after her dad died, really does. \u201cI wanted to go out there and strangle him,\u201d Paul says. \u201cI know you\u2019ve got your Rod Stewarts and all that, and your Mick Jaggers, but I couldn\u2019t understand why she was so attracted to John.\u201d To be honest, I couldn\u2019t, either. Dee seems lovely. When she\u2019s 40, he\u2019s going to be 75. What about if they have kids? He\u2019s not going to be much use, is he? Well, at least she can change all the nappies at the same time \u2026 Hey, who is being prejudiced now? I\u2019m outed, as a gappist bigot, for which I apologise. I will work on that. What matters is that they love each other and want to be together, which they clearly do. \u201cWe just click \u2026 we just work,\u201d says Dee. And, while John was never in the Rolling Stones, he was once lord mayor of Hull."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
