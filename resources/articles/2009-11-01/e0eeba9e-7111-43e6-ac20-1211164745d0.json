The equaliser was tainted, with David Ngog diving as a challenge by Lee Carsley made no contact. Steven Gerrard, on as a substitute, was unhindered by embarrassment as he converted the penalty awarded by the duped referee, Peter Walton, in the 71st minute. The best that can be said of the charmless episode is that it did not pave the way to victory for Liverpool. Rafael Ben\u00edtez's side remain seventh in the table. There is plenty of time left to restore the club's customary status but this had still been a disturbing occasion for the manager. It was noticeable that he retained the loyalty of a crowd that did not descend to booing even at the close of the match. If there is an immediate apprehension in Ben\u00edtez's mind it will be that, in principle, he did have the means on the field to overwhelm Birmingham. The manager will be keenly aware that his team has won only once in the past nine fixtures in all competitions. There is a more specific disquiet, too, about the task ahead in the league. Aston Villa and Manchester City are both above Liverpool in the table at the moment. If budgets are a cause of panic, Mark Hughes is the foe Ben\u00edtez should dread more. He brings expensive City to Anfield for the next match at the ground on 21 November. Hughes's side has been a disappointment of late but the burden will be heavier on his opposite number that day. The Spaniard must have anticipated a reassuring win over Birmingham and had let Fernando Torres have the night off to rest a hernia that had been causing him discomfort. Ngog, deputising for him, had opened the scoring but the 20-year-old, naturally, is no equivalent. It will not do, all the same, to dwell on absentees or ill fortune, even if there is a statistical hint of a hex now that Ben\u00edtez has completed seven league games against Birmingham without a win. The manager would be well advised to be grateful that these opponents did not take three points. It should have been a night to be relished by Liverpool. The line-up was far closer to full strength and the opposition should be among the weaker visitors. Ngog's goal felt overdue even though it arrived in the 13th minute. Liverpool were gliding effortlessly past City's left flank in that phase. Glen Johnson and Dirk Kuyt caused havoc and Joe Hart had already denied Ngog once before the opener. He was not to be denied again. Johnson explored that promising avenue on the right once more and the Birmingham goalkeeper made fine saves from the eventual scorer and Kuyt before Albert Riera set up Ngog for an unanswerable finish. These are unsettling days for Liverpool and the initially overwhelming superiority did not prevent an equaliser. James McFadden's deep free-kick from the right was headed by Roger Johnson and Scott Dann before Christian Ben\u00edtez, a \u00a37.7m summer signing from Mexico's Santos Laguna, recorded his first goal for the club. Life had begun to go wrong for Liverpool again and Gerrard's return to action had its origins in bad luck. The captain, who has been absent with a groin strain, came on in the 45th minute because of the recurrence of Riera's hamstring problems. There was nothing whatsoever wrong with Cameron Jerome's muscles moments later as he held off Javier Mascherano and lashed a dipping 30-yarder over Pepe Reina to re-establish the lead. In a well-known ploy Ben\u00edtez had his men back out on the field well in advance of the due start to the second half. This was presumably to imply that his line-up was in no mood to waste time as they set matters right. It was an occasion, all the same, in which no decision made by the manager had much influence. Birmingham are far from callow and continued to show the composure with which a pair of goals can endow visitors to even this stadium. Alex McLeish, their manager, is fully entitled to his disgust at the equaliser. The fashion in which it was secured must have been galling enough but the Scot will know too that Liverpool, by then, were in no shape to score legitimately. Gerrard had an impact of a sort even if he could not generate constant impetus. He is, after all, a relative convalescent whom Fabio Capello has excused the trip to Doha for England's friendly with Brazil on Saturday. With the club captain subdued, Anfield was muffled. For all that, Gerrard did galvanise the crowd when his header from a Johnson delivery hit the post. The incident did not truly inflame his team-mates. Temperatures will climb now purely because of a burning anxiety about Liverpool's form and long-term prospects."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
