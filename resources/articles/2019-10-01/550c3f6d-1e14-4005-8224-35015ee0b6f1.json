The return of the Great Britain team for the first time in more than a decade will take centre stage on Monday when Wayne Bennett\u2019s squad for the tour of the southern hemisphere is confirmed. Few players who were involved in the Grand Final on Saturday have had a wait as dramatic as Josh Jones. The 26-year-old forward was part of the Salford side beaten 23-6 by St Helens at Old Trafford, but that was far from the end of an eventful weekend for him: he got married on Sunday, while also receiving the nod from Bennett. \u201cThe wedding was supposed to be last weekend, but I said I thought we\u2019d make the Grand Final so we put it back,\u201d Jones said with a smile. \u201cWe knew we\u2019d have a busy couple of days but we\u2019re used to it. The honeymoon has gone up in smoke, but Olivia understands. If I\u2019m fortunate enough to be on the tour then maybe she can join me there and we can have it in Australia.\u201d Jones is one of many players who were involved in Saturday\u2019s final that were waiting for a call in the aftermath of Old Trafford. With experienced front-line internationals such as Sean O\u2019Loughlin and Sam Burgess injured, there is an opportunity for a new breed of players such as Jones and the St Helens forward Alex Walmsley to make their Great Britain debuts this autumn against New Zealand, Tonga and Papua New Guinea. For Walmsley, any call-up would be the culmination of a remarkable rise which has seen him go from promising amateur talent to Lions international in only seven years. \u201cJust a few years ago I was playing for Dewsbury Celtic on a farmer\u2019s field in front of 200 people,\u201d Walmsley, who won his second Super League title on Saturday, said. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing journey. This is the pinnacle of my career and, hopefully, it\u2019s all eyes on Great Britain now. We\u2019ll enjoy these next few days because this has been five years in the making, winning the title again. But I hope I can sneak on to the plane.\u201d One man who is guaranteed to be involved is the other half of the Saints\u2019 front-row superstars: Walmsley\u2019s partner-in-crime, Luke Thompson. \u201cI think he\u2019s the best in the world,\u201d said Walmsley. \u201cI saw him step up last year and do what he did and I was so excited to play alongside him again this year because he\u2019s an unbelievable player. \u201cTo play 70 minutes unbroken in a Grand Final ... tell me another front\u2011rower in the game that can do that.\u201d The contrasting journeys of Walmsley, Thompson and Jones \u2013 the latter two took the conventional route through Super League academies \u2013 underline how the Lions squad will be a group rich in contrast and diversity. When the final 23-man group is unveiled on Monday afternoon without more familiar names such as O\u2019Loughlin and Burgess involved, it will be a nod to the future of British rugby league, as well as the present."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
