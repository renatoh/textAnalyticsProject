In a cringingly wooden exchange the group of soldiers stationed in Saddam Hussein's home town of Tikrit told the president exactly what he wanted to hear - that Iraqis were eager to vote on a new constitution this weekend and the country's fledgling security forces were ready to meet the challenge. But before Mr Bush entered the room Alison Barber, a senior defence department official, went through a list of topics the president would later ask them about. At her prompting, the soldiers, who were displayed on a large video screen in a room of the Eisenhower Building next to the White House, raised their hands when the topic they were to answer came up. At one point, she said, Mr Bush would ask them specifically, \"In the last 10 months, what kind of progress have we seen?\" before asking who was prepared to answer the question. \"Master Sgt Lombardo,\" one of the soldiers replied. Minutes later Mr Bush asked the same question and Master Sgt Corine Lombardo responded: \"Over the past 10 months, the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces are improving ... They continue to develop and grow into a sustainable force.\" Mr Bush then asked: \"Do the Iraqis want to fight, and are they capable of fighting?\" He was told they were. Ms Barber insisted later the questions were not rehearsed. The military had been told ahead of time only about topics the president might want to talk about, not specific questions. \"We just knew broad themes,\" she said. The White House spokesman Scott McClellan said: \"All they were doing was talking to the troops and letting them know what to expect.\" But Democrats dismissed the event as a sham. The Senate minority leader, Harry Reid, said: \"The American people and our brave troops deserve better than a photo-op for the president and a pep-rally about Iraq. They deserve a plan. Unfortunately, today's event only served to highlight the fact that the president refuses to engage in a frank conversation about the realities on the ground.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
