The performance of Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas? perhaps speaks louder of the era\u2019s excesses than the earnest business of charity fundraising \u2013 a number of the participants look as if they may have availed themselves too freely of refreshments before taking the stage. But it also tells you something about the song itself: sober or otherwise, almost everyone looks faintly mortified to be singing it, because Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas? isn\u2019t a terribly good song. The people who wrote it would doubtless be the first to admit that, and in fairness, that isn\u2019t the point: Do They Know Its Christmas? has never been about luring in the public with its nonpareil melodic beauty and the brilliant incisiveness of its lyrics. Besides, ropey tune or not, at least the various versions offer a neat summary of then-prevalent pop trends. In 1984, you got booming stadium rock drums and synthesizer. In 1989, Stock Aitken and Waterman were very much in charge. The 2004 version \u2013 more of a period piece than you might imagine, with its appearances from the Thrills, Lemar and Daniel and Natasha Bedingfield \u2013 offered elegiac MOR piano balladry, UK rap, a guitar solo from Dan Hawkins of The Darkness and the cosseting tones of coffee-shop easy listening: Dido\u2019s contribution was considered of such pivotal importance that she was permitted to record it separately in a studio in Melbourne. The 2014 version \u2013 which debuted on the X Factor on Sunday night \u2013 feels more sombre and downbeat: it features plenty of representatives from the vogueish world of pop-house but their actual sound doesn\u2019t impact on the track at all. Unlike Band Aid 20, there\u2019s no guest rap, no knowingly mock-dramatic guitar showboating and no self-congratulatory burst of applause at the end. It\u2019s marked by a certain earnestness, which you could say befits a song addressing what\u2019s been described as the most severe acute public health emergency of modern times, but also tells you something about pop music in 2014, when album sales were dominated, in Britain at least, by singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran and retro soul singer Sam Smith, both of whom appear. The more cynical might suggest that in the age of twitchforkings and twitterstorms, when it sometimes seems that no pop cultural event can pass without someone somewhere forensically examining it in the hope of find something they can take offence at, might account for the fact that the song\u2019s lyrics have been rewritten, not merely to accommodate the Ebola epidemic but also to remove the kind of lyrics that people might describe as problematic: \u201ctonight thank God it\u2019s them instead of you\u201d is gone. The generalisation that nothing ever grows in Africa has likewise vanished. Meanwhile, anyone keen to sound the clanging chimes of doom for pop music \u2013 or at the very least, looking for evidence of its waning grip on teenagers\u2019 imaginations \u2013 might note that three of the vocalists aren\u2019t actually musicians. They are \u201cinternet personalities\u201d Zoe \u201cZoella\u201d Sugg, her brother Joe \u201cThatcherjoe\u201d Sugg and Alfie Deyes, the last justly famous as joint holder of the world record for the most number of bangles put on by two people in 30 seconds. Thirty years of philanthro-pop The original version of Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas? in 1984 came about after Bob Geldof joined forces with Midge Ure to raise money for famine relief in Ethiopia. They brought together 40 of Britain\u2019s biggest pop stars, including Boy George, Sting, George Michael and Duran Duran, on 25 November to record the song, which sold more than 3 million copies and raised more than \u00a38m. That version continues to sell copies every festive season and proceeds go to the Band Aid Charitable Trust. A second version, five years later, featured artists such as Kylie Minogue, Bananarama, Lisa Stansfield and Matt Goss of Bros and is perhaps the least remembered. Although it did not sell quite as many copies as the original, the song stayed at number one for three weeks in December 1989 and became the ninth best-selling single of the year. To celebrate the 20th anniversary, the song, it was re-recorded in 2004 to raise money for humanitarian relief in Darfur, where the Sudanese government was conducting ethnic cleansing. The version featured Robbie Williams, the Sugababes, Will Young, a rap verse from Dizzee Rascal, Bono and Chris Martin of Coldplay \u2013 the latter two are the only artists also to appear on the 2014 version. It also topped the chart in early December, stayed there to becomethe Christmas number one and was the biggest-selling single of the year. The version was the first to be available as a download.
