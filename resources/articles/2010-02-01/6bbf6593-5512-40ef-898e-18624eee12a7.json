It can draw crowds (and critics) to shows that might otherwise be overlooked in the hurly-burly of London theatre. This is the case here. You have to admire Sadie Frost (also playing in Fool for Love with the same company) for winning her spurs on the fringe. However, in the cameo role of Lady Anne she is the least interesting thing in Ben Kidd's revival of Shakespeare's historically inaccurate and dramatically precise account of the rise and fall of the most vilified of English kings. Kidd's modern-dress production, played out on a bare stage except for a large table that doubles as a coffin and boardroom-style desk, may be rough and ready, but it is racy and understands the cut and thrust of political intrigue. It has a Richard, played by Carl Prekopp, who is the office joke and so manages to achieve a boardroom takeover almost without anyone noticing. For a while he carries his twisted arm across his chest so it looks as if he is giving two fingers to the entire world. Prekopp is excellent as he turns from loser to monster: conversational, reasonable, a master at making everyone around him \u2013 including the audience \u2013 complicit in his rise. It is amazing how quickly murder starts to seem like the reasonable option. Matthew Simm is outstanding as the Cassandra-like Queen Margaret, and Candida Benson fine as the outmanoeuvred Queen Elizabeth making the leap from suited executive to bereaved parent. Jonathan Ward's Tyrell unpacks his backpack with sorrow every time he is called to do his murderous duty. There are other nice touches, including the doomed princes draped in their school blazers. Subtle, no; but it certainly grabs you by the scruff of the neck."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
