In a first for architectural conservation, a UK heritage group has set its sights on persuading global asset management firms based in North America \u2013 one of which recently launched a multibillion pound joint venture with British backers of a controversial scheme to refurbish London's Smithfield Market \u2013 to respect British architectural heritage. Conservation groups, historians and an array of prominent figures, including Alan Bennett, Patricia Routledge, Julian Lloyd Webber, Jeanette Winterson and Glenda Jackson, were outraged at the decision taken last week by the market's freeholder, the Corporation of London, to approve a radical redevelopment scheme backed by the asset management firm Henderson Global Investors. Designed by Sir Horace Jones, the creator of Tower Bridge, Smithfield Central Market opened in 1868 as the capital's main wholesale market for meat. Concern surrounds the future of the nearby Fish Market (1888), the Red House cold store (1899) and the General Market (1888). Much of the market complex is Grade II* listed, placing it in the higher ranks of protected historic buildings in England. The General Market, however, is not listed. The Henderson scheme involves the removal of a large amount of original fittings and interiors to create a steel-and-glass space for shops, restaurants and offices. The General Market would be cleared back to its external walls and adapted to house office blocks. A large office block is proposed behind the facade of the Red House. Original glass-and-timber roofs would be removed. Critics of the \u00a3160m Henderson scheme say much of the original historic fabric of the building \u2013 the magnificent glass and iron roofs and intact original interior \u2013 would be swept away in a development they describe as brutal and insensitive. The location of the proposed development is ironic, since Smithfield Market is only yards from Cloth Fair, where the poet and heritage campaigner Sir John Betjeman lived and worked. \"It's ironic the developers should be trying it on within sight of Cloth Fair and John Betjeman's back yard,\" said Bennett. \"Smithfield was the scene of many martyrdoms \u2013 this would be another. \"If you go to St Bartholomew's church nearby and then walk through Smithfield, it is like walking from one cathedral to another. You wouldn't pull down St Bartholomew's, nor should you pull down Smithfield.\" For Betjeman's daughter, the writer Candida Lycett Green, Smithfield has a power that her father revelled in. \"It's just a shortsighted way to make a quick buck,\" she said. \"My father and I walked through the market to go anywhere. We shopped there. He was the last person to be nostalgic. He would have seen that the market has to be used for something, if it's no longer a market, and not preserved in aspic, but there's no reason to mess it up. It's pure laziness. It's criminal to eradicate such a strong place.\" The conservation group Save Britain's Heritage has been leading the campaign against the Henderson scheme, alongside a large number of heritage bodies. The groups support a conservation-led scheme which would retain the Victorian features and use the space for food markets, cafes and bars. However, faced with government inaction and a Corporation of London whose planning committee last week voted 19 to two in favour of the Henderson scheme, Save is opening a new front in North America. \"The more we discover about the ownership and investment behind the Smithfield markets site, the more international the story becomes,\" said Save's director, Clem Cecil. \"Conservation battles will increasingly become international, especially for landmark buildings like this one.\" Cecil said Save will be pressing the investment businesses directly in their home countries, highlighting the threat to Britain's cultural heritage. Last month the US pensions giant TIAA-CREF \u2013 founded in 1918 by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie to provide pensions for Americans working in the arts, education and medicine \u2013 combined its property investment business with that of Henderson Global Investors, creating a \u00a313bn venture to speculate in land and buildings worldwide. As well as focusing on TIAA-CREF, Save is targeting the largest Canadian pension fund, Canada Pension Plan, which has close economic ties to Henderson through its international property investment arm. \"There is blatant conflict of interest over the site,\" said Cecil. \"Henderson is fronting a Canadian and an American pension fund, but the freehold belongs to the City of London.\" Campaigners in Britain hope that shareholders and investors in TIAA-CREF will put pressure on its new partner, Henderson, to abandon the Smithfield Market scheme in favour of one which protects the historic structure. \"We are disappointed that large foreign investors are using their investment to destroy our heritage,\" said Cecil. \"TIAA-CREF represents academics and cultural figures \u2013 I don't think they would be very happy to know that cultural barbarism was funding their pensions. Surely they would prefer to spend their pensions on coming to visit a beautiful and typically London site like Smithfield.\" Objectors say the Henderson-backed scheme does away with all but three portions of the exterior walls, the latest and most glaring example yet, say opponents, of \"fa\u00e7adism\" \u2013 the gutting of protected buildings so that while from the outside a building's appearance is unchanged, behind the fa\u00e7ade much, if not all, of the old building has been removed. Critics of fa\u00e7ading see it is a cynical abuse of the spirit of building protection law. The practice, they say, takes rules aimed at preserving old architecture to their literal, and absurd, extreme. Fa\u00e7ading has been widespread throughout central London over the past decade. Last week Geoff Harris, director of property development at Henderson, told the Architects' Journal: \"[We have] spent more than two-and-a-half years working and consulting with English Heritage, City of London planners and local residents and stakeholders to design a scheme that meets the needs of a growing city, while at the same time appreciating the heritage that has shaped it. The scheme will bring active and vibrant uses back to Smithfield.\" Objectors to the scheme said more than 250 letters opposing the Henderson proposals have been received, while some 2,700 signatures were on a petition opposing the scheme that was handed to the culture minister, Ed Vaizey. Campaign groups insist that the proposals for Smithfield be called in by Eric Pickles, the communities and local government secretary, for urgent review. \u2022 The image of Smithfield Meat Market that was accompanying this article was removed on 23 July 2013.
