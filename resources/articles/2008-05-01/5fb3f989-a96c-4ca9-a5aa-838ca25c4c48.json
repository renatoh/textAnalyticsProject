Someone, it must be a Dimbleby, says \"the Liberal Democrats have taken Hull.\" Poor sods, I think. Is it that I am getting old - only four months younger than Ken Livingstone, for heaven's sake? Or am I just sensibly irritated by wall-to-wall 24/7 media coverage when there is little or nothing to say? I realise that in typing these words I am part of the problem. It is clear that the Tories look like ending up with 40% of the vote, possibly more. On BBC Dimbleby George Osborne is being cautious to match his grown-up haircut. \"40% would be good,\" he says. And \"we are aware we are fighting on a very high base\", ie the 2004 results. A few results dribble in. Labour has held Sunderland (almost impossible to lose) and the Tories held Tamworth - but lost Coventry. The BBC has announced they are ahead by 17 seats to Labour's 13, plus 3 LDs and 2 others. Tension City it is not. The excellent Henry Macrory, top Tory press man, keeps emailing Patrick Wintour with up-to-date intelligence, not much to be sure. I ring a Labour whip who has been on the phone all day. \"I've been talking to Labour MPs all over the country and they all say 'it doesn't feel as bad as we thought it would be.'\" he says. In the background Jeremy Vine is going quietly mad with the still-unblemished BBC graphics - a demented role in which he succeeded Peter Snow. My Labour friend has been told that the results in Reading - which Labour had virtually conceded weeks ago - are not as bad as feared. \"We are apparently still in contention.\" East London is a problem. Working class Labour voters do not see Ken Livingstone as their kind of geezer; \"he's not on their side.\" There has been a big-turnout in Romford, not necessarily good for the Tories either: watch that BNP vote, says my source. Plaid Cymru is doing well in the valleys, he says. Colleagues in the Guardian news room are excited that Mr Osborne's make-up looks a mess. At his left in the studio sits Charles Kennedy for whom we adjust the colour contrast. Tessa Jowell, the Julie Andrews of the Labour government, has also had a decent haircut. Polly Toynbee is talking to Emily Matlis and Michael Portillo and clever Tony Travers of the LSE who once told me Mayor Ken has become an economic Thatcherite. I wonder if Ken has decided to have an early night; at our time of life we can't afford to take chances. Emily Matlis has been watching three bloggers blogging which is a bit sad. Most of the political bloggers have little more to report than I do, but are pretending otherwise. On the Telegraph site, Europhobe MEP Dan Hannan is very excited. Counterintuitively I take that to be a good sign for Progressive Britain. If ConservativeHome's prediction that Boris has won the London mayoralty is correct it will be a \"superb vindication of the dispersal of internet-based media over the old monopolies,\" says Dan. It will also be a victory for semi-detached candidates over party affiliation and for direct primary-based democracy over the old ways. Yeah, right, I think. A lot of rightwing Tories currently talk this sort of ephemeral nonsense. I think we can expect to hear less of it when they regain power. A bit of excitement comes into my life when GU's Deborah Summers sends me an exclusive dispatch from Lewis Baston, a very bright chap from the Electoral Reform Society whose goal in life is to stage the perfect election, fair in every particular. Lewis says: The first results of the English local elections are starting to trickle in, declared by some of the more ambitious council elections departments who take pride in a quick count. There are obvious limits as to how much can be read into these straws in the wind, but the turnout seems to be a few points down on last year. Harlow has some early declarations, and these are nightmarish for Labour. The party has lost two wards it successfully defended last year, one of them (Toddbrook) in an overwhelming swing to the Conservatives. This is bad news indeed in one of Labour's most endangered parliamentary marginal seats. Tamworth in Staffordshire, another marginal Labour seat, saw a quick efficient count and a Tory win, with one gain from Labour to give them a landslide in seats - nine out of 10. But this was won with just under half the vote, and with Labour not too far behind on 37%. Time to think about proportional representation in local elections? What more can I add after that blood-stained report direct from the front? On the BBC a reporter is saying \"Nuneaton and Bedworth council is under Conservative control.\" It sounds like a war. \"Nuneaton and Bedworth has not been under Conservative control since 1984,\" cries a top colleague at my elbow. Rumours sweep the battlefield that Labour has lost Sunderland after all, to no overall control. But cries of \"bollocks\" punctuate the air, none of them uttered by Professor Anthony King, who is talking on the BBC - as he has done for more years than I care to remember. Ms Matlis, the high point of the evening so far, is now talking to Jon Culshaw of Dead Ringers. It is time to treat myself to a glass of water and find a quiet sofa on which to evaluate the significance of the results so far."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
