On the first day\u2019s trading after the Christmas break the FTSE 100 index of the biggest listed companies in London jumped by 37 points, or 0.5%, to close at 7,106.08 points on Wednesday night, two points above the previous high set in April 2015. Traders said the rally was the result of optimism in the American economy, with data earlier this week showing consumer confidence in the US had hit a 15-year high. Investors are also anticipating a surge in US government spending, with president-elect Donald Trump having pledged a new $1tn fiscal stimulus programme once he takes office. Mining companies led the way, with their shares jumping in quiet trading, on the first session since the Christmas holidays. Silver producer Fresnillo leapt 5.2%, gold miner Randgold gained 4.8%, while mining giant BHP Billiton rose 4.2% and Anglo American picked up 3.5%. Major international firms benefited from the weak pound, which fell to a two-month low of $1.222 against the US dollar. With just two sessions to go, the FTSE-100 has now gained 13% since the start of 2016, despite a series of market shocks including the Brexit referendum result and the US election. That rise means the worth of the 100 most valuable companies listed in London has jumped by about \u00a3230bn this year. Mining shares have been the star performers in 2016, after suffering major losses in 2015 when commodity prices crashed. This year, the prices of oil, iron ore, copper, nickel and coal have all risen, as fears that China would suffer an economic \u201chard landing\u201d have eased. Trump\u2019s vow to rebuild America\u2019s highways, schools and airports has also driven up commodity prices. Anglo\u2019s shares have almost quadrupled in value this year, highlighting how 2016 has been the best year for mining companies since 2009. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says mining firms have made a \u201cremarkable comeback\u201d over the past 12 months. \u201cSmall losses are the order of the day across most stock markets today, but London\u2019s traders have evidently come back from Christmas with a festive bounce in their step. The FTSE 100 is the star performer today, helped on its way higher by an excellent turn from the index\u2019s mining contingent,\u201d Beauchamp explains. Energy stocks also gained ground, after the price of oil traded near one-year high. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets said shares were boosted by \u201cgains by oil and optimism regarding what Trump can do for the economy following his inauguration in a few weeks time.\u201d David Cheetham, market analyst at online trading group XTB, said shares typically rally in the quiet period at the end of a year. \u201cObservers of the markets have for many years noticed a strong propensity for stocks to rise in the period between Christmas and the New Year and this phenomenon appears to be playing out once more,\u201d Cheetham said. These increases are known as a \u201cSanta rally\u201d by City workers. The FTSE 100 is now just 23 points shy of its all-time intraday high, set in October. The index has gained 12% since the EU referendum in June, despite fears that a vote for Brexit would derail the economy. However, the FTSE 100 is priced in sterling, which has tumbled by 17% against the US dollar. This has made Britain\u2019s companies particularly attractive to US investors, helping to push up share prices. The FTSE 250 index, which contains medium-sized UK companies, also rose on Wednesday, gaining 0.5%. But it is only up 3% for 2016, substantially lagging the internationally-focused FTSE 100. Wall Street was unable to follow the City\u2019s lead by setting its own record highs. The Dow Jones industrial average faltered in morning trading, dropping by 0.4% to 19,863, dashing hopes that it might finally crash through the 20,000 point mark for the first time ever. Some investors are also bracing for fresh volatility in 2017, with a Trump presidency and the triggering of formal Brexit negotiations likely to rock markets next year. A survey of top City economists and fund managers found that 40% expect the pound to be languishing below $1.20 in a year\u2019s time. \u201cThe UK economy has held up relatively well in the short time since the referendum, although without clarity on the blueprint for exiting the EU, the longer-term consequences are still open to debate,\u201d said Chris Saint, currency analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, who conducted the survey. \u201cExchange rates are determined by the interaction of a diverse range of political and economic factors, including interest rates, inflation and growth, all of which are up for grabs in 2017, which is likely to make for lively currency markets in the coming year.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
