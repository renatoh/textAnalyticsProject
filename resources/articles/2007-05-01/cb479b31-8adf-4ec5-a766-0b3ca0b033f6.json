It's wider reaching in its lyrical content - with Dizz declaring his intention from the opening whirl of 'The World Outside' ('There's gotta be more than this, man') - and, more importantly, in its musical range, from the radio-friendly, Bugsy Malone-sampling 'Might As Well Quit' (featuring playful gangster moll Lily Allen) to the superbly radio-unfriendly 'Pussyole'.
