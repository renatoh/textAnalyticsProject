Skandia Cowes Week was transformed yesterday when a 12-15 knot south-easterly wind kicked in just before noon. Smiles appeared on competitors' faces as the yachts burst into life, and no one was happier than Peter Harrison, who used many of his America's Cup squad aboard the 52-foot Chernikeeff 2 to win the IRM series. With Ian Budgen steering and Richard Sydenham calling the tactics, Chernikeeff 2 scored a second victory yesterday, to add to her second place on Saturday, and beat Nick Hewson's Team Tonic by a point. Harrison also announced that the Olympic champion Iain Percy is to join his team for an assault on the sport's oldest prize. Percy joins the GBR Challenge after the Olympics in Athens for the 2007 Cup races. The big boats of Class 0 were once again led home by Nick Lykiardopulo's 55-foot Aera. She beat Paul Winkelman's 60-foot Island Fling by almost 10 minutes - halved by the handicap correction - with Richard Matthews's Flirt, the Queen's Cup winner, third. Age was no barrier for Richard Loftus's Desperado; the Swan 65 was launched 26 years ago but still won Class 1 by five minutes on corrected time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
