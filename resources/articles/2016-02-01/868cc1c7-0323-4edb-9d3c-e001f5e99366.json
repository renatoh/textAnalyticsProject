Based on the infamous Scottsboro case and a rape trial in her home town of Monroeville, Alabama, in the 1930s, and portraying her lawyer father as Atticus Finch, a saintly hero who opposes the racism of his white community even while he understands and forgives it, Mockingbird was an instant classic, winning the Pulitzer prize and selling millions of copies worldwide. It\u2019s much less often recognised that Lee also anticipated the frustration and gender consciousness of the women\u2019s movement. When Mockingbird was published, women in Alabama could not even serve on juries, a huge irony in light of the novel\u2019s central trial scene of a black man accused of rape. When his young daugher, Scout, is indignant, Atticus Finch brushes it off with a joke: \u201cI guess it\u2019s to protect our frail ladies from sordid cases like Tom\u2019s.\u201d Alabama finally granted women the right of jury service in 1966, among the last three states to do so. Go Set a Watchman, an early draft of the book recovered by her attorney and published in 2015, showed Atticus more realistically as a white supremacist, shocking devoted readers of Mockingbird, but again uncannily in key with the national mood of angry disillusion over racial progress. In the context of the American rejection of racist symbolism, Atticus became the fictional equivalent of the Confederate flag. It was the right time to take him down, and Watchman too became a massive bestseller. But Watchman also made gender injustice more central as well. Told from the point of view of a grown-up Scout, it emphasised the confinement of the feminine role, especially in the genteel white South. The \u201cworld of femininity\u201d Scout notes, was a \u201cworld she despised\u201d. Lee had been a tomboy and a maverick herself, conspicuously ignoring conventions of feminine charm as an Alabama college student (\u201cEverything about her hinted of masculinity,\u201d one classmate recalled); a law student (briefly); and an aspiring writer in New York. It\u2019s not surprising that the novel has been listed as one of the top books about lesbian growing-up. Lee became reclusive and apparently stopped writing \u2013 or publishing \u2013 after 1960, much to the frustration of her admirers. It\u2019s always been easy for the elite to patronise her. Flannery O\u2019Connor called Mockingbird a book for a child, and other novelists too have scorned it as sentimental YA (young adult) fiction. I would be astonished if any of the Republican presidential candidates had read the book or could comment on it. But I think Lee was an important American novelist deserving of serious attention. Her contribution to American literature, like Julia Ward Howe\u2019s Battle Hymn of the Republic, or Margaret Mitchell\u2019s Gone With the Wind, was a singleton. But she managed to capture the zeitgeist twice, a remarkable achievement. Now that she has become part of literary history, she may finally get the critical justice she deserves."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
