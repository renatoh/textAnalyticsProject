Caddick and Gough were vanquished last summer as Australia mocked England's improvement with a 4-1 win, with Wisden remarking that \"seldom had such high expectation before an Ashes series ended in such summary demolition\". The possibility is that this will prove to be their dreadful denouement. To expect them to be reborn in Australia, making light of a host of bad memories and combined years of 66, demands dollops of optimism. But Caddick, 34 in November and eager to prove that a rib injury is behind him, steels himself to talk positively, however uncomfortably, like someone fresh out of a self-help class. \"Gough and Caddick playing together is still our best chance of winning the Ashes,\" he said. \"Goughie brings another dimension to our cricket. The fact his name is on the board boosts the side. Hopefully his knee injury will come right.\" Not since the final Test at the Oval, when Australia rattled up 641 for four declared, has England's established pairing shared the new ball. Both opted out of a tour of India for personal reasons, decisions followed by injuries that have sidelined Caddick for two months and might end Gough's international career. Since then Matthew Hoggard, Simon Jones and Steve Harmison have begun to press the next generation's claims and have contributed enough for England to need only one Test win to secure a double series win over India and Sri Lanka. Gough has vowed to be at Headingley, raising a beer (but only one) to the belief that Caddick remains England's likeliest matchwinner. Caddick himself professed to be impressed with his potential usurpers, but only up to a point. The implication, however supportive, was that it was nice to see boys coming to terms with a man's job. \"I don't think I have anything to prove,\" he said. \"Perhaps the fact that I have been injured has been good for English cricket in that more fast bowlers have had a chance. But I've had seven injury-free years, so I can't complain about seven weeks out and after a nice little rest hopefully I will be kicking on for the rest of the year. I want to play everywhere, in everything, this winter. I'm sure I can play on until 36 or 37. \"Steve Harmison is raw; young with heaps of potential,\" he added. \"Potentially he is a very fine bowler but he is at the beginning of a learning curve and in Test cricket these days you have to learn very quickly.\" Harmison had something else to come to terms with yesterday: the bat he used on debut at Trent Bridge was stolen from his car on Monday while he was watching Newcastle play West Ham, though his England cap was untouched. Caddick's memories trip back two years, to a two-day rout of the West Indies, with himself and Gough at the heart of it. Headingley is not expected to bestow its favours so easily this time. Ronnie Irani, meanwhile, faces a race to be fit for the ICC Trophy after undergoing keyhole surgery on his right knee. Debris was removed which should enable him to return for Essex on September 4 but, with the Sri Lanka event due eight days later, he will have little time to prove his fitness. The Sky commentator David Lloyd, dubbed \"paranoid\" by Steve Waugh following suggestions that he signed for Kent only to spy on English talent, has spoken to the Australian. \"We're both very relaxed about it,\" Lloyd said. \"We go back to the days when he was playing for Somerset and I was a first-class umpire.\" \u00b7 India's rebel players have been given a deadline of noon today (7.30am English time) by their board to sign up for the Champions Trophy. Selectors will then pick a provisional squad of 20. England's players are watching developments in Australia before signing. Only one Englishman has so far returned his contract."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
