Citing \"profound changes sweeping the news business\" but making no mention of News Corp's contentious bid for its owner Dow Jones, the Journal said the changes were designed to simplify its international news structure. Marcus Brauchli, managing editor, said: \"We have been as agile as anyone at adapting to change in recent years. Yet simply to maintain our standing we must adapt to constant change.\" One of the key changes is the promotion of Wall Street Journal Online's managing editor, Bill Grueskin, to deputy managing editor for news. The second most popular newspaper in the US wants to uphold its reputation for in-depth reporting while also catering for audiences that increasingly take instant news reports for granted. Mr Grueskin's mission will be to balance timely news stories with \"the long-form, deeply reported and analytic journalism that defines the Journal\", the paper said in a statement. The shake-up comes as the newspaper's controlling Bancroft family seeks reassurances from Mr Murdoch that editorial independence would be protected in the event of a buyout. The family had initially rejected the bid, but they have since met Mr Murdoch and were expected to send off proposals today on what editorial safeguards they want in place. Meanwhile, Dow Jones employees are seeking alternative bidders, fearing that Mr Murdoch would interfere in the running of the Journal. The media mogul is thought to have proposed an autonomous editorial board along the lines of the one he created at the Times and Sunday Times, but Dow Jones union members say that structure has not worked."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
