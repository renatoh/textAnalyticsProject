The latest records of MPs\u2019 financial interests reveal that Christensen accepted a free \u201creef trip from Cairns to Great Barrier Reef\u201d from a company named Axiomatic Events. Axiomatic is known for its involvement with rightwing figures, and organised last year\u2019s Australian tour by Southern, a Canadian who was barred from entering the UK for \u201calt-right\u201d provocations deemed not to be \u201cconducive to the public good\u201d. Southern had previously handed out pamphlets declaring \u201cAllah is gay\u201d and was on a boat attempting to obstruct a charity vessel from helping migrants in the Mediterranean. Axiomatic had arranged for Southern to meet up with Christensen, Dr Peter Ridd, a controversial marine scientist, and some local young conservatives on 16 July 2018, leaving from Cairns and taking a fishing charter out to the reef. But Southern declined to interview Christensen during the trip. He instead posted a video of him and Ridd, out on the reef together. Christensen has only just this week declared that Axiomatic paid for the boat trip, more than a year after it took place. Other costs appear to have been picked up by taxpayers. Christensen claimed $1,600 worth of expenses, including two nights of travel allowance, worth $622, for a trip to Cairns on 15 and 16 July last year. Christensen charged taxpayers $495 for a flight between his home town of Mackay and Cairns on 15 July, and another $495 to fly from Cairns to Townsville on 17 July. He also attended a meeting of North Queensland young conservatives event that evening. The Axiomatic Events director Dave Pellowe said he had organised for Christensen to join Southern on the reef. \u201cI basically had invited him along as a friend, and George offered to pay but I declined,\u201d Pellowe told Guardian Australia. \u201cHe basically cleared his schedule believing it would not only be enjoyable but productive. \u201cBut there was a miscommunication with Lauren and she didn\u2019t want to do it. He was there and available but she pulled the pin. Well, she missed the communication. He wasn\u2019t collaborating with the tour but he was going to be available if she had questions about the reef and tourism.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Southern began her Australian tour by arriving in an \u201cit\u2019s OK to be white\u201d T-shirt \u2013 a slogan sharing a long affiliation with white supremacist groups overseas, including the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis. Her live event in Victoria attracted significant protests. Victoria Police billed Axiomatic $68,000 for the cost of providing a police presence. But Axiomatic has refused to pay, and the bill remains outstanding. Pellowe said the bill was a violation \u201cof the implied freedom to political communication\u201d, and dared police to try to recoup the money. \u201cI sent them a solicitor\u2019s letter and told them that any communication with me would be wasting their breath because short of an order from the high court of Australia I will never, ever pay the bill,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can take us to every court in Victoria, and if we lose we\u2019ll take it to the high court. It\u2019s a violation of the implied freedom to political communication. I seriously dare them, they [the Victorian government] are cowards and bullies and they\u2019re lying.\u201d Victoria Police confirmed on Friday the bill had not yet been paid. But a spokeswoman said police would no longer seek reimbursement. \u201cVictoria Police will not be seeking to recover costs for services provided for this event,\u201d she said. Christensen\u2019s office was approached for comment. This article was amended on 2 August 2019 to make clear that Lauren Southern went on the trip, but did not interview George Christensen. The Guardian previously understood she had not attended."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
