The wrongfooting move could soak up appetite for new telecoms shares ahead of BT's anticipated rights issue, designed to bring down the struggling company's debt. The placing underlines the differing fortunes of BT and Vodafone as well as the relative speed with which they are willing to take action. Ironically, the cash raised by Vodafone will chiefly be used to pay for stakes in Japan Telecom and its mobile phone subsidiary, J-Phone, that are being disposed of by BT to cut its debts. The placing is likely to provoke an angry reaction from BT executives. On Monday Vodafone increased its investment in Japan Telecom when it acquired a 10% holding from US telecoms group AT&amp;T for $1.35bn (\u00a3925m). If the agreement with BT goes ahead it will take its stake still higher - to 45% - while its holding in J-Phone will reach 46%. It is not certain which institution is being used to place the shares for Vodafone although it has in the past used the likes of Goldman Sachs and UBS Warburg. BT hopes to raise \u00a34.5bn from the disposal of its stakes in the two Japanese firms as well as a 17.8% share in Airtel, the Spanish mobile phone company. Vodafone is also in discussions to buy the Airtel stake which would give it more than 90% of the business. BT had otherwise faced the indignity of being a shareholder in a company which Vodafone aims to rebrand under its own name. While BT scuttles back to Britain, Vodafone has maintained its momentum overseas and has become the world's largest mobile phone company. BT has a market capitalisation of\u00a336bn compared with Vodafone's \u00a3138bn. The retreat from Japan is viewed as a visible weakening of the chief executive, Sir Peter Bonfield's position in the company. Sir Peter has been closely identified with the Japanese investments and, until now, BT has maintained that the stakes were not among the targets for disposal. The City welcomed BT's decisive action although analysts said it had done little to reas sure them of the company's long-term strategy. Shares in BT climbed 41p to 599p, their highest level for more than two months. BT's withdrawal comes just two weeks after the company negotiated options to buy 5% stakes in J-Phone's operating businesses from Japan Telecom. The agreements were seen as a sign of BT's determination to keep its foothold in Japan. BT invested \u00a31.2bn in Japan Telecom, together with AT&amp;T, just two years ago. BT has been widely expected to launch a deeply discounted rights issue to raise \u00a35bn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
