The Tory party leader has promised to free the NHS from \"political interference\" by cutting bureaucracy and scrapping all waiting list targets. The pledge came at the launch of the first Conservative consultation paper on NHS reform, which called for politicians to have a reduced role in the organisation and provision of healthcare. The shadow health secretary, Liam Fox, said the NHS was \"undermanaged on the frontline but over-bureaucratised at the centre\". He also said all acute hospitals would be given foundation status so they could set their own pay levels and be free to borrow money. \"We will examine all ways to make this possible, including the potential issuing of community hospital bonds,\" he said. The Conservatives' plans, entitled Setting the NHS Free, said that central administrative targets would be abolished and there would be a \"substantial reduction\" in the bureaucratic structure needed to implement them. Dr Fox said he would like to see the number of Department of Health staff reduced by 20-30% and a \"downgrading\" of the powers of the health secretary. But the document does not include any details about how the reforms would be funded. Dr Fox said it set out the \"architecture\" of their plans and funding would be addressed in subsequent documents. The document is part of a consultation process that will provide the basis for the next Conservative manifesto. At the launch of the report at Conservative Central Office, Mr Duncan Smith said that Labour's approach to the NHS had failed to improve patient care and led to low morale among the health profession. He said: \"We have a clear vision of an NHS under a Conservative government - an NHS free from political interference, where doctors can work to clinical rather than political priorities and patients have a real choice within the healthcare system.\" Mr Duncan Smith said that under the Conservatives the NHS would \"offer high quality care, free at the point of use and irrespective of ability to pay\". Dr Fox said, under their proposals, trusts would be measured by a reformed commission for health improvement which could take account of trusts' different needs. A key objective would be to ensure that future funding allocations were rational and reflected clinical considerations. Primary care trusts (PCTs) would commission primary care and fund acute hospital trusts on the basis on their activity levels, but generally not provide services. Gill Morgan, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents health service managers, said the document was \"an important and considered contribution to the current health debate\". She said: \"Many of the issues raised go with the grain of the existing proposals to increasingly shift the balance of power from Whitehall to the frontline. \"The Conservative proposals effectively combine minimum national standards with greater scope for local communities to set their own priorities and to go further and faster. We think this deserves more serious discussion.\" She welcomed the fact that primary care would not face further structural change but said separating provider and commissioning roles for PCTs would need careful thought. But the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) expressed concern at the plans for foundation trusts and local pay negotiations. A spokeswoman said: \"RCN members are committed to a national pay and career structure to achieve consistent standards throughout the UK.\" But the Conservative proposals for reduced bureaucracy and increased clinical freedoms might lead to some improvements in the NHS, she added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
