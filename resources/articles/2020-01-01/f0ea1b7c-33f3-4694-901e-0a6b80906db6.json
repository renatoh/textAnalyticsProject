An offer of \u20ac10m plus add-ons was rejected last week but Inter are confident that their new bid, which will be presented to Spurs on Tuesday, will be enough to see the Dane leave north London after six and a half years. Inter have already agreed personal terms with the 27-year-old and he would be able to join them on a free transfer in the summer but the Serie A side\u2019s coach, Antonio Conte, is keen to bolster his attacking options for the remainder of the season. Juventus have pulled four points clear of Inter at the top of Serie A and Inter managed only a 1-1 draw with Lecce on Sunday despite taking 24 shots. Conte is already without Alexis S\u00e1nchez due to a long-term injury and is also trying to sign Olivier Giroud from Chelsea. The club have already acquired Ashley Young from Manchester United in this window, following on from the signings of S\u00e1nchez, on loan, and Romelu Lukaku from the Premier League club last summer. Conte is also trying to seal a deal for Victor Moses to join the club in this transfer window. Moses, who played for Conte at Chelsea, is currently on loan at Fenerbahce. The Nigeria international is set to move to Italy on a new loan deal until the end of the season, with an option to join permanently for \u20ac10m (\u00a38.5m)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
