An unprecedented 318 women are running as Democratic or Republican candidates for the 470 seats available across the House of Representatives and the Senate, up from a previous record of 257 set in 2018. Of those candidates 117 are women of color, building on the midterm elections of two years ago which saw high-profile women such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, in New York, and Ilhan Omar, in Minnesota, elected. By early Wednesday, 13 non-incumbent women had been elected to the House and one to the Senate. Of those, seven were Democrats and six Republicans. In Missouri, Cori Bush, a nurse who cut her teeth politically during anti-police brutality protests in Ferguson in 2014, was elected to the House of Representatives for the state\u2019s first district. The election of Bush, a progressive, was a boost for the left of the Democratic party. \u201cToday, I became the first Black woman elected to represent Missouri in Congress,\u201d tweeted Bush, who also shared a photo of herself with the congressional portrait of Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman in Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s 2020. I shouldn\u2019t be the first, but I am honored to carry this responsibility.\u201d Bush\u2019s district includes St Louis and Ferguson, where she rose to prominence as a fearless activist after the police shooting of Michael Brown. Bush\u2019s election came 2,278 days after Brown\u2019s killing, Bush noted following her victory. \u201cToday we take this fight for Black Lives from the streets of Ferguson to the halls of Congress. We will get justice.\u201d Teresa Leger Fernandez clinched a victory in New Mexico. She will join Deb Haaland, a Native American woman who was elected in 2018, in the House. Like Haaland, Leger Fernandez is a progressive Democrat, and she was endorsed by Elizabeth Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez during her campaign. The makeup of Leger Fernandez\u2019s third district is notably diverse: 40% Latino and 20% Native American. Texas could see Candace Valenzuela triumph in the state\u2019s 24th congressional district, though early on Wednesday she trailed narrowly with 76% of the vote reporting. Valenzuela would become the first Black Latina in Congress, if she wins a district that has voted Republican since 2005. In October Valenzuela told the Guardian it was \u201ctime that the folks in power reflect the communities they serve\u201d. \u201cAs we see more women and women of color running for and winning seats in office, we\u2019re seeing the focus of our elected officials shift towards working families and the challenges they face,\u201d she said. Joyce Elliot, an Arkansas state senator, attempted to become Arkansas\u2019s first ever Black member of Congress, but failed to knock off incumbent French Hill as the state again elected an entirely Republican delegation to the House. In Georgia\u2019s fifth congressional district \u2013 the longtime seat of the civil rights icon John Lewis \u2013 Democrat Nikema Williams, a Black woman and chair of the state\u2019s Democratic party, handily beat Republican Angela Stanton-King. Among the newly elected Republican women are Cynthia Lummis, who won the Senate race in Wyoming, and Maria Elvira Salazar, a Cuban American Republican and longtime broadcast journalist who defeated the Democratic incumbent Donna Shalala. Only 48 of the 535 members of the House and Senate are women of color, according to the Center for American Women and Politics. There are 127 women in Congress overall. The majority of female candidates this year are Democrats, although there has been an increase in the number of female Republican candidates from 2018. Two years ago Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley became high-profile additions to Congress. All four won re-election on Tuesday. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 November 2020 to give a total of 470 seats up for election across the House and Senate, instead of 535. Thirty-five of the Senate\u2019s seats are in play this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
