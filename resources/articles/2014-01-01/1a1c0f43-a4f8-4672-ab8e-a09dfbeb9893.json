Metro Bank, which was founded by Vernon Hill, a US financier, said over the weekend it had raised capital by selling shares to institutional and private investors. The company said it sold the stock at a share price 30% higher than at its previous capital raising in June 2012, and that the deal brought the total amount raised by the bank so far to \u00a3641m. The capital raising is Metro's fourth since it launched in 2010 as Britain's first new high-street lender for more than a century. It promised to shake up the country's banking industry and now has 25 branches in and around London, with plans to have 200 by 2020. Last year it reported a \u00a3100m annual loss, which it said was expected during an early period of expansion. Each branch \u2013 or store, as the bank's founder and chairman, Vernon Hill, prefers to call them \u2013 costs a minimum of \u00a32m to build and launch. Hill made a fortune from growing and selling Commerce Bancorp in the US for more than $8bn (\u00a35bn). The government is keen to encourage competition in a banking industry dominated by five players, two of which were bailed out by taxpayers during the financial crisis. Metro plans to use the new funds to expand its retail, commercial and private banking operations. It said that, following the capital raising, it was one of the most secure banks in the country, with a leverage ratio of 25% and a tier one capital ratio of 63%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
