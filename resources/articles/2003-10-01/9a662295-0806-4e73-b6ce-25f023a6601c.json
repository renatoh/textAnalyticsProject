Four days of extensive treatment have failed sufficiently to improve the injury, suffered in an awkward fall during Liverpool's defeat against Arsenal on Saturday, and Owen left the team's base in Hertfordshire yesterday afternoon. Eriksson had considered including him on the trip to Turkey as a means of bluffing England's opponents into thinking he would be available for Saturday's Euro 2004 qualifier. However, that plan was abandoned because Owen was incapable even of walking without a limp and the Liverpool manager G\u00e9rard Houllier wanted him to return to the club for more medical treatment. The news, although widely expected, will be a major setback to Eriksson, coming in the midst of last night's crisis talks aimed at averting a players' strike. As well as losing arguably his most accomplished defender in Rio Ferdinand, the manager will go into England's most important match in the qualifying campaign without his only regular goalscorer. Owen has scored 24 goals in 53 appearances for his country and his absence leaves Eriksson dependent on largely unproven strikers. The Everton teenager Wayne Rooney is almost certain to start in the Sukru Saracoglu stadium but who will be named alongside him is open to conjecture. Eriksson must decide whether to play James Beattie or the more experienced Emile Heskey, with Darius Vassell starting among the substitutes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
