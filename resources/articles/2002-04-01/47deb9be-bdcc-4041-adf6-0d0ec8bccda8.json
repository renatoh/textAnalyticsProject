Other cures through the ages have included eating hare and hedgehog testicles (but not together), licking the hooves of a newborn lamb or standing naked over a burning bird's nest. Modern-day treatments aren't quite so grim, but they're far from perfect. (Would you like to sleep on top of an alarm system that wakes the whole house with the first drip?) Despite the best efforts of the medical profession, we haven't found a cure and bed-wetting continues to exist in all societies, in all cultures, misunderstood and steeped in shame. National Dry Night Campaign is being launched on 9 May, partly in response to a recent survey which found that 80 per cent of parents wrongly believe that stress and worry are the major causes of bed-wetting, and nearly a third think it results from children being too lazy to get out of bed. The launch is accompanied by a new website providing information on bed-wetting, divided into sections for both parents and children. Although much of the impetus behind the campaign has come from a drug company (more about that later), professionals working in the field are grateful for the publicity. 'Bed-wetting affects half a million UK children, yet it just isn't something people want to talk about,' says Penny Dobson, director of Eric (Enuresis Resource and Information Centre). 'Parents and children feel very alone with it. It's not one of those medical conditions that's discussed at the school gate.' Bed-wetting, or enuresis, becomes a 'medical condition' when it occurs at least three times a week after the age of five. This covers about one in six five-year-olds, one in 11 nine-year-olds and one in 50 teenagers. It is most common in boys. 'Our helpline takes 800 calls a month, and our website records 400 hits a week,' says Dobson. 'Some of the calls are from children who are frightened of being discovered by their friends and bullied at school. It almost becomes a 'dirty secret', something they don't want anyone to know. They often feel different, and slightly separated from their peers. They may be too frightened to stay at friends' houses, or go on school trips. 'We've been contacted by young people from ethnic-minority groups who are about to get married and haven't told their partners,' says Dobson. 'We've even acted as a go-between for young musicians too frightened to join youth orchestras because of the travelling. Then there are the calls from parents at the end of their tether - mothers on income support who have three enuretic children and no drying facilities in the house.' One mother who called Eric 'at the end of her tether' is Julia, a teacher whose son and daughter aged 13 and 11, are both enuretic. 'My son started at the age of four,' says Julia. 'He was dry for a year before that, but broke his arm and had to stay in hospital for a fortnight. I wasn't worried at first. We thought it was a temporary response to being in hospital, but it never got better. My daughter started at the age of seven and we have absolutely no idea why. We hadn't recently moved, there was no change of school. There was nothing we could pin it on. 'Practically speaking, it's hard work. I had to throw out a mattress the other day because the plastic undersheet moved. Duvets are a problem - we tried waterproof covers but the children hated them, so we just have to buy new duvets every so often. I have a tumble drier but try not to use it too much because of the cost. It's also expensive on washing powder. 'The worse thing, though, is how it affects their lives,' she continues. 'None of their friends know, and both children are very reluctant to stay at friends' houses because of it. They've both had accidents while away. My daughter was sensible enough to tell the parents, who were very discreet, but my son tried to hide it and nothing has ever been said. I've tried to encourage them to go on school trips - and always talk to the teachers first. 'I worry that it has made them shy. I wet the bed until I was 17, and was quite introverted as a result. I never slept anywhere but home, and always stayed quite close to my mother.' The fact that Julia had enuresis made her children significantly more likely to suffer it, too. About 40 per cent of children with one enuretic parent will wet the bed, rising to 70 per cent in children who have two enuretic parents. Researchers in Denmark recently claimed to have identified the chromosome area responsible, based on blood samples of two generations of bed-wetters. Though we may be some time away from the 'bed-wetting gene', research has established the physical reasons for 99 per cent of bed-wetting. The most common is insufficient production of vasopressin, a hormone that reduces urine production at night. The second cause, responsible for about 30 per cent of cases, is bladder instability, which makes the bladder empty itself before it is full. (Children with this usually urinate frequently and in small volumes through the day). The third factor, which does not cause bed-wetting alone, but is present in most cases, is lack of arousability. The sensation of a full bladder is not enough to wake the child. So these are the reasons - the 'cures' are less simple. Children aged between five and seven who present at clinics are given basic bladder training. 'Our initial response would be to give parents information and encouragement, to let them know how common it is, and get them thinking positively,' says Dr Eve Fleming, community paediatrician for three 'Getting Dry Clinics' in South Warwickshire. Early measures include increasing daytime drinking (the only way to stretch a bladder and increase capacity), encouraging the child to 'hold on' longer during the day, leaving pull-up nappies off at night, and possibly introducing a small reward system. If these measures have no effect, most clinics will suggest alarms. Available through Eric from about \u00a360, these can be worn on the person, or attached to the bedding, and will set off when they become wet. 'These are not right for every family - they can be stressful and fiddly to use,' says Dr Fleming. 'But they have a very good success rate.' Most tests have found that 25 per cent of children using alarms will improve within two to six weeks, 50 per cent in three months, and 90 per cent in six months, after which time they are rarely needed. The child has learnt to wake unaided. However, some children object to alarms, and sometimes the resulting succession of interrupted nights is just not practical - during exam time, for example, or following the birth of a new baby. 'As a last resort, I might prescribe medication for older children who need a confidence boost, who really need the experience of staying dry,' says Dr Fleming. The most popular medication is Desmopressin, a synthetic form of vasopressin (made by Ferring Pharmaceuticals, sponsor of the Dry Night Campaign) which effectively shuts down the kidneys for the night. Though it has a very high success rate, the drug must be withdrawn within a carefully structured programme, otherwise, the bed-wetting frequently resumes. For some children, however - Julia's included - none of the above will have a significant effect. 'We've been to the clinics, had all the tests, tried just about everything,' says Julia. 'The alarm didn't even wake my daughter up. My son once took Desmopressin for three months, and, when he came off, the bed-wetting was worse than it had ever been. Now we just use the drugs for holidays and sleepovers.' Julia's next step is to try alternative remedies, of which hypnosis is reported to be the most effective (with success rates ranging from between 19 and 77 per cent). 'We're still looking for a miracle cure, because the children are so fed up with it,' says Julia, 'but, to be honest, I think it's something they will have to grow out of, just like I did. My mum was very good - she never got cross - and I'm the same. If the beds are wet, it's not a big deal.' This is definitely the right attitude to take, as the overwhelming feeling among professionals in the field is that parents shape the child's attitudes to bed-wetting. If the parent is angry, intolerant or punitive, the child suffers guilt, shame and low self esteem. We may not be able to cure the condition completely, but we can minimise its impact. 'Bed-wetting is not life threatening, it doesn't hurt and it's definitely not their fault - I know that from 17 years' experience,' says Julia. 'The best thing I can do is just get on with it - until, hopefully, one day, it will stop altogether.' \u00b7 Eric helpline: 0117 960 3060"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
