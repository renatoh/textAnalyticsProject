It could be Gould's signature role, crystallising the sardonic yet bemused presence he brought to such other Altman pictures as M*A*S*H and California Split. In 1970, Time magazine put Gould on its cover, declaring him a \"Star for an Uptight Age\", and now BAMcin\u00e9matek \u2013 the repertory house at the Brooklyn Academy of Music \u2013 has borrowed the description for its current season of the actor's work from the 70s. Gould grew up in Bensonhurst, a few miles further south in Brooklyn, the son of Jewish immigrants. Speaking at a screening of Little Murders (1971) at the weekend, he described his trepidation at the start of his career, uncertain that someone like \"me, Elliott Goldstein\", could make it. \"It frightened me. I was always very \u2013 as we would say on West 9th St \u2013 ascared \u2013 ascared of being judged.\" As late as Bugsy (1991), he needed 15 takes to overcome his Brooklyn accent and enunciate the first \"n\" in \"incognito\". \"I hope you like it,\" Gould said by way of introducing Little Murders. \"I know that it's interesting. Then you can tell me what you think afterwards.\" It's a curious pleasure, an increasingly surreal satire on urban alienation in contemporary New York. Alan Arkin's third feature as director, it was adapted by Jules Feiffer from his own play, in which Gould had starred off and, briefly, on Broadway. He played Alfred Chamberlain, a photographer and self-described apathist who takes pictures of shit and drifts into a relationship with can-do Patsy Newquist (Marcia Rodd) while, in the background, the city comes apart at the seams. This is a New York of brownouts, heavy-breathing phone calls, vandalised amenities and random shootings that escalate to absurd levels \u2013 \"this goddam city\", as Mr Newquist calls it, is an early view of NYC-as-dystopia, a sketch of Travis Bickle's Manhattan played for laughs. The film is also a showcase for some virtuoso set-piece monologues from the likes of Donald Sutherland as a highly irreverent wedding officiator (\"What nonsense,\" he says of the vows, \"what a shocking invasion of privacy\"), Arkin as a police lieutenant on the verge of a nervous breakdown and Gould himself, when Alfred describes a series of letters he wrote to the agent monitoring his mail at college. The star enjoyed the show. I happened to be sat a couple of seats to Gould's right, and he laughed throughout, including at his own performance. The sequences set in Patsy's family home with her parents and adolescent brother seemed to tickle him particularly. \"This was made in 1970,\" he murmured to his companion. \"It's really good, isn't it?\" After the film ended, Gould did ask the audience what they made of the feature. The first response was not too encouraging: a young man in the front row said that, although he was a fan of the actor's work, he \"despised\" the film's violence. Gould bridled at his lack of appreciation for Feiffer's satire. \"Well, you're an authority, you're taking notes,\" he snapped. \"I'm just an artist. But I respect your opinion. I felt that way when I saw The Dark Knight lately...\" Other audience members testified to how accurate or prescient they found the film's depiction of New York. Later, Gould insisted that \"Jules is making a point as to how callous we have become. And we will become more callous.\" Jean-Luc Godard had briefly been interested in directing the adaptation, perhaps drawn to its anhomie. \"He took me for a walk round the block,\" Gould recalled. \"It was 57th Street, Carnegie Hall. He said, 'If my wife and children ask me to tell them I love them, I tell them to go fuck themselves.' I said, 'That's very strong, Jean-Luc, but I don't think I'm there yet.'\" The eventual director, Arkin, apparently received an appreciative note about the film from Jean Renoir. Gould leaned towards the young man in the front row. \"You like his work?\" he drawled. When it came to his long monologue about the surveillance agent, Gould had a simple but effective preparatory method. \"I went out very privately and smoked a joint to keep focused. So my only problem, because it was just one shot, was my mouth got a little dry.\" He also went into more detail about his early professional anxieties and how he was \"ascared of being judged, like this gentleman here\". He turned again to the young man in the front row, this time sincere. \"It frightened me not to please you.\" Out in the lobby, at an informal drinks do, things were less serious. I found Gould reminiscing about his friendship with the older Groucho Marx. \"He used to let me shave him as he stood there, fully dressed, in his beret,\" he said. \"I once changed a light bulb for him. Stood on his bed to do it. He said, 'That's the best piece of acting I've ever seen you do.'\" Some performers might have taken umbrage. It was okay with Gould."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
