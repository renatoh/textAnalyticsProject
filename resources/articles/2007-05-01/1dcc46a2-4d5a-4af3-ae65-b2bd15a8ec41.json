But what was the effect of the Blair years on the relationship between the media and politics? Lance Price, former director of communications at the Labour party, says Blair's relationship with the media was \"both his making and his undoing\". The BBC politics presenter Andrew Neil and the Guardian commentator Michael White also give their views on the podcast this week. There have been changes too at Guardian Unlimited, with a new look for the online homepage. There has been, to put it kindly, a mixed reaction: I put some of the users' criticisms to Emily Bell, the Guardian's director of digital content. Media Talk, as regular listeners will be aware, has a keen sense of camp; we could not avoid, therefore, a Eurovision preview with Paddy O'Connell, presenter of the BBC's coverage of the semifinal. Plus, Neil tells us about his latest acquisition in the TV industry and Gareth McLean rounds things off as usual. \u00b7 Details of how to listen to Media Talk and the rest of the Guardian's audio output can be found at theguardian.com/podcasts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
