My boyfriend suffers from contact dermatitis and as a result has a severe allergy to all biological washing powders and liquids, cleaning detergents and all types of soap. I wondered if you could recommend a specialist travel wash? Natalie Grant, by email While popular travel washes such as Mountain Suds or Lifeventure (both available from Nomad Travel Store (020 8889 7014; nomadtravel.co.uk) are non-biological, they do contain some detergent or soap. Your boyfriend may be allergic to these, but I haven't managed to find a travel wash that doesn't contain some detergent. Try one of these products first to see if it has any negative effect. If readers can suggest an alternative, I'd love to pass on the good news. My husband and I have planned what effectively amounts to about half a day in Paris at the end of April, arriving at Gare du Nord around midday and needing to be back there around 6.30pm. It's my first visit and really I just want to take in some of the major sights, including the Louvre if time permits. We'll eat breakfast and dinner on Eurostar, so don't have to build in time for a long lunch. Can you suggest a route around the city? Sue Griffiths, by email A half day is better spent in Paris than anywhere else, and you should be able to see the city's big three. After stepping off the train hop straight in a taxi to the Eiffel Tower. It may not be as quick or cheap as the Metro, but staying above ground means you'll see more. Avoid lift queues by taking the stairs in the south pillar to the first and second levels. Then take the Metro to St Michel, where you can grab a coffee before the short walk to Notre Dame. It'll be around 3pm by this point so leg it up to the Louvre. This walk will give you some flavour of Paris on foot. You'll find the Louvre frustrating, because ideally you'd have at least a day here. Rather than try and see all the classics, which are spread around, pick one of the galleries and see it in some detail. Speed up your visit by booking tickets in advance at louvre.fr. After around 90 minutes it'll be time to catch the Metro back to the Gare du Nord. My wife and I have booked a trip to Australia and we need insurance. Our trip is partly arranged by an agent (Hayes &amp; Jarvis) and partly by ourselves. Is there a measure by which we can know we are dealing with a reputable firm? Rob McCulloch, by email Standard travel insurance should suffice, provided you've checked the small print and are happy with the terms. What insurance you need will vary, depending on your trip and what you plan to do when you're away. Check you're covered for any activities, as well as for what may seem like an excessive amount of medical and repatriation costs. A good amount of cover is \u00a310 million. You should make sure you're covered for every part of your trip, and this will involve taking out cover separate to what you've arranged through Hayes &amp; Jarvis. While there isn't a gold standard for travel insurers, there are a few things to look out for. Insurance underwritten by another company should be less of a concern than that your requirements are covered. Check the company has a 24-hour helpline. More importantly, check that someone competent answers it if you call it in the middle of the night. Atlas Direct (020 7609 5000; atlasdirect.co.uk) is a travel specialist. My husband and I would love to visit Libya, particularly Leptis Magna. I've seen some organised tours advertised, but they tend not to spend enough time at the site. As my husband is an archaeologist we tend to spend much longer than most at sites. Is it possible to take an independent holiday in Libya, staying in good hotels? Susan Card, by email Independent travel is still off the agenda in Libya partly due to a desire to keep tabs on tourists entering the country, some of whom have looted treasures in the past. That said, there's no need to join a tour that doesn't fit with your plans. Lots of companies can arrange tailor-made itineraries allowing for as much time as you like at Leptis Magna, Sabratha and Cyrene. You'll need a tour firm's help to root out good places to stay. Caravanserai Tours (020 8855 6373; caravanserai-tours.com) gets consistently good reviews from travellers. We have just bought tickets for Ryanair flights from Liverpool to Venice. However, on closer inspection, the airport is Treviso. Is it possible to catch a train from Treviso airport direct to Venice? John Stoneley, by email There's no train link serving Treviso airport. A coach runs directly to Venice, costing \u20ac4.50 (\u00a33) and taking an hour, going via Mestre on the mainland before arriving at Piazzale Roma in Venice. An alternative is to catch the local bus from outside the airport. The journey to Treviso railway station takes 20 minutes and costs 80 cents (55p); tickets are available from the arrivals hall. From Treviso, trains to Venice cost \u20ac4 (\u00a32.75). The ultimate trip In November and December we asked you to help a reader plan his perfect round-the-world trip.
