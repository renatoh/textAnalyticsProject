Figures released by the Department for Education and Skills showed that while class sizes had improved in primary schools since Labour came to power in 1997, the situation in secondary schools had got slightly worse. The average primary school class size was 27.6 in 1997, dropping to 26.4 in 2002. The average class size for secondary schools was 21.9 in 1997 and 22 in 2002. Infant classes are capped at 30, and teaching unions want to see an appropriate cap on junior and secondary classes as well. The National Union of Teachers said: \"The government delivered on its promises to limit class sizes for five to seven-year-olds, unfortunately it hasn't extending that limit throughout the education system. It really needs to. It won't happen on its own. This is unacceptable for children's education.\" The NUT is currently embroiled in a row with the government after it refused to sign a workload agreement which would have given classroom assistants greater responsibility in the classroom. The education secretary, Charles Clarke, has refused to attend the union's annual conference, citing the behaviour of its delegates. Eamonn O'Kane, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, said he \"regretted\" that there had been no change in class sizes. \"Infant classes aside, size is very variable around the country. Demography might come to the government's rescue because the primary school population is set to go down over the next few years - provided of course the number of teachers increase as we want to see. There's still a considerable way to go to achieve a proper class size. I think it underlies the necessity to bring in class size limits that exist in infant classes.\" Phil Willis, Liberal Democrat education spokesman, said: \"Children need the time and attention of their teachers if they are to achieve their full potential. The recruitment and retention of quality teachers is vital if British schools are going to reach an improved teacher pupil ratio.\" He added: \"Rather than making puerile attacks on the NUT, the secretary of state should realise that what our most deprived children need is more time spent with professional teachers rather than with unqualified teaching assistants.\" Nobody from the Department for Education and Skills was available to comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
