But the trepidation among many Liverpool fans before their visit to Watford was understandable, even after a weekend in which their rivals for a top-four finish had fallen over themselves to drop points. The sense of anguish was palpable right up to the final whistle, with even J\u00fcrgen Klopp admitting his heart missed a beat when Watford\u2019s Sebastian Pr\u00f6dl smashed a shot against the crossbar in the last moments. \u201cI said to the players after the game if they want to kill me, that\u2019s a good way to try it!\u201d he quipped. One would think Liverpool\u2019s manager would be used to scares by now. Some say he is partly to blame for them. Sixteen months and 96 matches into the German\u2019s reign, his side remain an oddity, sometimes brilliant, always brittle, apt to beat the best and lose to the lowly. One can see what Klopp is trying to do and it is marvellous when it works; but when it does not work, one wonders whether he can see the problem. And whether he has the clarity of mind to fix it. Evidence from the trip to Vicarage Road could be used to build a case either for those who believe Klopp is the man to lead Liverpool back to glory or those who believe he is turning the Anfield club into the new Arsenal, a hyperactive but similarly flawed version of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s chronic disappointments. On the one hand Liverpool have done well to be third in the table at this stage of the season, given their shortcomings and relatively shallow squad. On the other hand, it must be exasperating for fans that Klopp\u2019s side are not already safe in the top four, or even challenging for the title, given that they have proved they can overwhelm even Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur. As it was, strengthening their chances of reaching next season\u2019s Champions League was their one remaining ambition when they arrived here. They seized their chance. But they almost let it slip, too. The only progress that really matters now is the number of points gained and Liverpool got the three for which they came. Beyond that it was difficult to know how satisfied they should be. Liverpool have frittered away points this season against all seven of the teams below Watford in the table. Last week they lost at home to Crystal Palace, after which the sound of Sam Allardyce blowing his own trumpet was excruciating for Liverpool fans because they knew the former England manager struck the right note. Liverpool, as Allardyce had anticipated, defended set pieces with all the poise of circus attendees who had accidentally volunteered to face the knife thrower. And Klopp\u2019s next public move was not reassuring. It was perverse. Awarding Dejan Lovren a new four-year contract days after the centre-back was bullied by a striker (Christian Benteke) whom Klopp had deemed unsuitable for Liverpool (while Mamadou Sakho sat in the stands as an exiled Liverpool player) seemed the sort of idea that an internet troll might have suggested. The fact that it came from the club raised uncomfortable questions about Liverpool\u2019s summer investment plans and Klopp\u2019s judgment, similar to the question that was first raised when Simon Mignolet was handed a new contract two months after Klopp\u2019s arrival. A solid performance from Lovren, left, and the rest of Liverpool\u2019s defence would be the best way to start answering those questions. The test was of their concentration as much as their skill and strength. Watford\u2019s ploy was to defend deep and count on an opportunity to score from a rare counterattack and/or a Liverpool mistake. That has worked for many lesser sides against Liverpool, who have at times struggled to create chances against massed defences. With Watford posing no threat in the first half, Lovren, usually the last man in Liverpool\u2019s defence, had little to do but collect passes and keep the ball circulating. He mostly did that fine but a couple of times Klopp had to remind him loudly to push out after making a pass so as to preserve the offside trap. A coach needs to keep on top of Lovren. Liverpool then went in front thanks to Emre Can\u2019s well-executed scissor-kick. Briefly they seemed to control proceedings with encouraging authority. But then came some trademark snoozing from Mignolet, who was almost caught napping by a long-range shot from Daryl Janmaat. Then, in the dying seconds, and despite the presence of three Liverpool centre-backs after Klopp had introduced Ragnar Klavan, Pr\u00f6dl somehow found himself free in the box with a clear sight of goal. His miss was a let-off for Liverpool. If Klopp\u2019s team finish in the top four, their season will be a success and they will have got away with their defects. And Champions League participation will make it easier to attract players who can add stability. Klopp needs to pick the right ones."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
