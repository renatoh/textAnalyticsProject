The Manchester-based retailer yesterday announced half-year profits up 45% to \u00a323.5m, on turnover 8.6% higher at \u00a3237.3m. The City applauded the figures, sending the shares up 11% to 148p. Alan White, the chief executive, said: \"I believe that if you focus people on particular activities you can achieve wonders.\" In May this year the group sold its television rental service, Teleview, for \u00a36.2m and the following month the personal loans portfolio First Personal for \u00a39.95m. Mr White said the capital released from the sales had been invested in the business. This month it also closed its Express Shopping Channel digital TV joint venture with media group Northern &amp; Shell. N-Brown has increased its range of womenswear and footwear, allowing for a broader customer base, and the strongest sales increase came from catalogues targeted at the under-45s, which increased by 10% to \u00a357m. Sales to N-Brown's core market, 45- to 60-year-old women, increased by 9% to \u00a3157m. The half-year figures included sales from the luxury range, House of Bath, which the group acquired last November. Mr White said the more affluent customers this brand attracts were an under-utilised market that was important to the success of home shopping. He saw the sector as the key to further expansion. No further rationalisations were planned and the company now had a \"clear steer\" about where its future lies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
