The former foreign office minister Tony Lloyd, who was a frequent critic of the invasion, will be pitted against Ann Clwyd, who spoke out strongly in favour of the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime and was appointed Tony Blair's human rights envoy to Baghdad. Both have been emollient MPs for 20 years and come from the \"soft left\" of the party, with friends across the spectrum, but they have also attracted enemies. Rumours that Joan Ruddock was also poised to stand faded as nominations closed yesterday, leaving some MPs predicting that Ms Clwyd would prevail in a closely fought contest which will shape relations between No 10 and the Labour backbenches at a critical time. Voting among 355 Labour MPs, including the ministerial \"payroll vote\", will take place by secret ballot on Tuesday and put the winner in a crucial position, representing backbench views to the prime minister at weekly meetings with the parliamentary committee and elsewhere. Many MPs fear that, for all his promises to \"listen and learn\" from Labour's 47 lost seats on May 5 and his own unpopularity, Mr Blair plans to govern without changing his dismissive view of parliament. Sensible MPs believe there will soon be a crisis if he does not do better by them. Some were alarmed last night by confirmation that the party leadership in Wales was expelling 20 activists who backed Peter Law, the independent Labour candidate who beat the Blairite Maggie Jones in Blaenau Gwent on May 5. The MP for Manchester Central since 1983, Mr Lloyd has been a regular critic of the government since his departure from the Foreign Office in 1999, a victim of the row over Sierra Leone. He has rebelled on Iraq, tuition fees, foundation hospitals and anti-terrorism laws. Ms Clwyd, the MP for Cynon Valley in south Wales since 1984, backed the government on most of those issues, but has been a tenacious champion of human rights for many years and was an early backer of the Kurds against Saddam. Their allies say neither Mr Lloyd nor Ms Clwyd wants to make Iraq an issue. \"The regime [No 10] can probably live with either of them, but Blair would probably prefer Ann,\" one well-placed MP said last night. But Mr Lloyd, who ran Clive Soley a close second for the PLP chairmanship in 2000, has strong ties with the trade union group of MPs. They may offset her support among women MPs, who helped elect Jean Corston (now a peer) to the post in 2001."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
