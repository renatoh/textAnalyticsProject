So we are grateful to the UK's largest communications consultancy, Bell Pottinger, for reassuring us - just as we thought it was safe to tuck into the roast chicken again - that the killer disease is still, in fact, a killer. Tim Bell's PR outfit, fresh from the success of its devastatingly effective \u00a33m campaign to promote democracy in pre-election Iraq on behalf of British taxpayers, tonight hosts a \u00a3100-a-head \"seminar for business leaders\" winningly entitled Bird Flu - Don't Wing It and offering a host of handy hints on how to protect \"your business and your reputation\" when the killer virus strikes. Back to the bloody beef, then. And back to the drawing board for our unexciting Stand By Stewpot campaign, which despite being described by more than one (well, one) reader as \"delightfully postmodern and wittily tongue-in-cheek\" has lamentably failed to come up with any reasons likely to convince the evil controller of Radio 2, Lesley Douglas, to retain the services of the sexagenarian former Radio 1 DJ and legendary Crackerjack frontman. While one reader (we'll spare his blushes) declared authoritatively that Stewpot's show was \"one of three essential music programmes on BBC radio\" (the others, in case you were wondering, being Late Junction and Gilles Peterson), most of you, sadly, seem only too happy to see the back of it. On a related, or at least contemporaneous, note, we are alerted to the alarming existence of the brand-new Cliff Richard Box, which promises Four of Cliff's Most Enduring and Magical Concerts on Four Sensational DVDs and will make, it says here, the Perfect Mother's Day Gift. Only, we would suggest, if you really hate your mother. This one is serious. We try hard to rise above the petty jibes of rival newspapers' diarists. But we feel honour bound to respond to a vicious and wholly unprovoked attack from the Independent's Pandora, who notes little short of amusingly that we recently had a go at hedge-fund-trading alleged leftist and Times columnist Oliver Kamm, while the following page of the same paper featured a \"bombastic column\" by, um, Oliver Kamm. Now it so happens that page 8 of yesterday's Independent featured a bombastic moan by Philip Hensher about the current rash of obituaries of \"some footballer or other\" whom he has \"never heard of\". The odd one \"of conspicuous significance and celebrity, such as George Best\" would be all right, he says, but he cannot see that \"most footballers deserve such lavish outpourings of grief\". By happy coincidence, page 36 of the same newspaper contains a half-page obituary of one Roy Clarke, a \"pacy Manchester City winger\" of the 40s and 50s who was, we feel quite sure, of most conspicuous significance and celebrity. To all those who smirked at this week's news that male drivers waste 6m hours a year by refusing to admit they are lost, we reply with the salutary tale of Michael Chapman, arrested and charged with stealing a car after stopping to ask for directions at the house of the car owner's father. Chapman, 54, allegedly stole the motor in Hopedale, some 130 miles from Columbus, Ohio, and drove it for three miles before stopping randomly to ask the way at the house of Thomas Eltringham, who instantly recognised the gold Buick as his daughter Norma's. See where admitting your ignorance gets you? Finally, worrying evidence that Darling Dave Cameron may be losing his hitherto sure touch with the all-important female demographic. First, we hear from an impeccable source, growing numbers of his women colleagues are becoming convinced that he dyes his hair. Second, speaking on The Modern Family at an event organised this week by the Equal Opportunities Commission, he was asked if he was a feminist. \"I'm not sure what a feminist is any more,\" he replied, \"but probably not.\" Wobbly, Dave, definitely wobbly. diary@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
