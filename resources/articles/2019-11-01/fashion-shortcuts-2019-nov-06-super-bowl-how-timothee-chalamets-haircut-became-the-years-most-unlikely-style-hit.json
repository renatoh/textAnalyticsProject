It was a hilarious, ever-so-brutal line about body politics that also gave a nod to Chalamet\u2019s pop-culture dominance. A large part of this is due to his own personal style. He regularly reinvents the menswear wheel by pulling off outre high-fashion looks on the red carpet (think of his Louis Vuitton harness, the all-white Berluti Oscars suit and his recent shiny and spacey Haider Ackermann number, featuring an external cummerbund) with adorable effortlessness. Of course, he has his own tribe of fans (the \u201cChalamanaics\u201d) who were divided when the trailer for the historical drama The King dropped in June, along with Chalamet\u2019s big hair reveal: a bowl cut. Those behind the Twitter account Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet\u2019s Hair were enamoured (\u201cI. Am. Dead\u201d) while others mourned the death of his wavy do (very much in the \u201cit might be OK once we get home and run it under the cold tap\u201d mould, unfavourably comparing it with Claire in series two of Fleabag). Indeed, for those of us who associate the \u201cdo\u201d with a bedroom, a blunt pair of scissors and a reluctant sibling cutting around a Pyrex dish placed on your head, it may be surprising to hear that some labelled the bowl \u201cthe hottest haircut of the summer\u201d. Chalamet\u2019s was a bit messier than some pop-culture \u201cbowls\u201d of yore (think Spock from Star Trek or Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber) but it has started a celebrity trend. Harry Styles, Charlize Theron and Stranger Things\u2019 Joe Keery all got one (Esquire lovingly labelled this \u201cthe Rob\u201d after the Smooth hit-maker Rob Thomas). The key to the cut, as the hairstylist Ryo Murakawa told GQ: \u201cTarget the hair line above the ears and go as short as you can for the under-cut to get a severe bowl-cut shape, and then texturise the top section with a razor.\u201d So far, so manageable. Less so is the trimming of the do, which needs to be done once or twice a week. Chalamaniacs, it may be time to get the Pyrex dish out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
