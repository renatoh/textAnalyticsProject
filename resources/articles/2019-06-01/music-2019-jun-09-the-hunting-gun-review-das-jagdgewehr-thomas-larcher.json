The 55-year-old Austrian features as composer and pianist, and the festival was launched with the UK premiere of his opera, Das Jagdgewehr (The Hunting Gun), which was first performed at the Bregenz festival last summer. With a libretto by Friederike G\u00f6sweiner, based on a novella of the same name by Yasushi Inoue, it\u2019s a quietly intense domestic drama set in postwar Japan, played out in a single 100-minute span. A poet observes a lonely man hunting in a wintry landscape, and writes a poem about his apparent loneliness. Some time later, he receives a letter from someone who identifies himself as the solitary hunter, Josuke Misugi, and who encloses three further letters that explain the reason for his sad isolation. The letters come from his wife, Midori, asking him for a divorce, his lover Saiko (who is Midori\u2019s cousin and best friend) telling him she is going to kill herself because their affair has been discovered, and from Saiko\u2019s daughter, Shoko, who is appalled to learn of the affair. The opera then revisits the events described in the letters up to Saiko\u2019s suicide, and to Midori\u2019s revelation that she knew of the affair all along. But it is all rather one-paced, and presented with dream-like detachment, as if dredged out of collective memory. That\u2019s despite the expressive beauty of Larcher\u2019s vocal lines, which include some terrifyingly high writing for Shoko, and the striking detail in the ensemble writing, with luminous textures that shatter into icy shards, and contributions from an off-stage chorus woven in and out of them. The spare production by Karl Markovics is taken over from Bregenz last year, with two of the cast \u2013 Giulia Peri as Midori and Sarah Aristidou as Shoko \u2013 repeating their roles. They are joined by Iris van Wijnen as Saiko, Peter Sch\u00f6ne as the icy Misugi and Samuel Boden as the unnamed poet; Exaudi supply the off-stage voices. It is all wonderfully secure under Ryan Wigglesworth as conductor, and the production sees the debut of the Knussen Chamber Orchestra, created in memory of the composer who was so closely identified with Aldeburgh and conducted his last concerts there a year ago. \u2022 At Snape Maltings, Aldeburgh, on 9 June. The Aldeburgh festival runs until 23 June. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 June 2019. An earlier version mistakenly said that three cast members were repeating their role from the production at last year\u2019s Bregenz festival, and included Peter Sch\u00f6ne as Misugi among them. That should have said two of the cast; Sch\u00f6ne wasn\u2019t in that production. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
