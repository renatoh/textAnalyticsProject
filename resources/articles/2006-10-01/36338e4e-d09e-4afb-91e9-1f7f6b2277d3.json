Finsceal Beo, who took the Prix Marcel Boussac for Bolger in authoritative style, is 12-1 second-favourite for the 2007 1,000 Guineas, while the victory of Aidan O'Brien's Holy Roman Emperor in the Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere franked the form of his recent defeat by Bolger's Teofilo, who hardened as favourite for the 2,000. Holy Roman Emperor, meanwhile, is 6-1 (from 8-1) with Coral for the same race after beating a field including Andre Fabre's much-touted and unbeaten colt Visionario. Teofilo is 7-2 (from 5-1) with the same firm. \"He is getting better with every run,\" Aidan O'Brien, Holy Roman Emperor's trainer, said. \"He's fast, he's very tough, he quickens up and he stays, and if all is well with him we could go to the Dewhurst, because competitive racing brings out the best in him.\" Mandesha, who was a possible runner in the Arc itself until earlier in the week, will have that race as her main target next season after her victory in the Prix de l'Opera. Alexandrova, three times a Group One winner this year, was outpaced at the trip and could finish only third. Desert Lord, who took the Prix de l'Abbaye for Kevin Ryan, may end his season in Hong Kong, while Sergeant Cecil won his first Group One race under a well-timed ride from Frankie Dettori. \"He's not had a hard life,\" Rod Millman, Sergeant Cecil's trainer, said. \"Next year we'll have another try at the Ascot Gold Cup.\" Ron Cox's tip of the day Caustic Wit 2.50 Wolverhampton Sixth at Goodwood last time - minus the cheekpieces, which are back on today - Caustic Wit is currently rated 11lb lower on the all-weather and this veteran sprinter is clearly on good terms with himself at present. He won narrowly at the end of August over this course and distance, and a mark 3lb above that winning one gives him every chance of a follow-up this afternoon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
