She writes, she says, \u201cto unlock the code of silence that I kept for so many years \u2026 so that I can, at last, feel present in my own life.\u201d The book opens with a wry, shocking account of finding her alcoholic father \u201cin a small pool of his own shit\u201d in a run-down Greek hospital: \u201cAfter years of teaching Beckett plays, I am finally living in one.\u201d Elsewhere she explores the silences and shame associated with growing up in a female body: lifelong sexism and female conditioning, taboos around menstruation, the \u201chunger regime\u201d of her troubled adolescence, and her \u201cwild child\u201d years identifiable only in retrospect as a time of neglect and sexual exploitation. The medics\u2019 obfuscation around her miscarriage and the oddity of being the child of separated parents in a country without divorce are particularly Irish experiences, but what is most striking about the collection as a whole is its universality. These are not new stories, but they still urgently need to be told. Pine does so with an honesty and vigour that are always uplifting, despite her painful material. \u2022 Notes to Self: Essays is published by Penguin (RRP \u00a39.99) .
