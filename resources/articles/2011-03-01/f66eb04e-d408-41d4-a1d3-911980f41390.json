Frozen Kiev will host a shoot-out between Dynamo's Andriy Shevchenko and City's Edin Dzeko. This sub-plot is further spiced by the fact that Shevchenko is an idol of City's \u00a327m January arrival from Wolfsburg. \"I still have a home in Sarajevo and there is a room where the walls are covered with football jerseys,\" said Dzeko. \"One is a Milan shirt with Shevchenko's name and number on the back. It is an original from one of his Serie A appearances and he has autographed it. It has pride of place. It really is my prized possession. It always brings a smile to my face when I see it.\" One of Dzeko's treasured memories is a meeting with the one\u2011time \u00a330m Chelsea forward when Wolfsburg played Milan and he ended up with a second shirt. \"Shevchenko was always the favourite player for me. He was my idol. When we met we exchanged shirts and talked for a while. It was great. He had some tough times with Chelsea but England is very different from other leagues. I'll have to get used to it too. Hopefully I'll have a lot of success.\" The last time Shevchenko, now 34 and back at the club where he began his career, played against City he scored in a 6-0 Chelsea win at Stamford Bridge. With temperatures forecast to drop to around -6C (21F) this first leg at Dynamo's Lobanovksy Stadium promises to be anything but straightforward for Roberto Mancini's side. A City defence lacking Kolo Tour\u00e9 will need to be mindful of not just Shevchenko but Artem Milevskiy. The Ukraine international tends to be deployed as an outright striker with Shevchenko occupying a deeper role. Dynamo may have been supplanted domestically by Shakhtar Donetsk but they remain formidable opponents. Mancini has reason to be wary of Ognjen Vukojevic, a Croatian international holding midfielder with the capacity to seamlessly transform defence into attack. Another Dynamo strong suit is the understanding between the overlapping Brazilian right\u2011back Danilo Silva with Oleh Gusev, a clever winger. \"Kiev is a good team,\" said Manchester City's manager. \"It will be a difficult game but the big problem is the pitch. It's so hard because it's so cold, it isn't good enough at the moment.\" At least he has Dzeko on his side. \"Edin is one of the best strikers in Europe,\" said Mancini. \"And I'm happy he will also be one of the best strikers in England.\" Manchester City (probable) Hart; Richards, Kompany, Lescott, Kolarov; De Jong; Vieira, Y Toure; Silva; Balotelli, Dzeko. Dynamo Kiev (probable) Shovkovskiy; Danilo Silva, Khacheridi, Leandro Almeida, Popov; Gusev, Eremenko, Vukojevic, Yarmolenko; Shevchenko, Milevskiy.
