Speaking in front of a packed crowd in San Jose, Zuckerberg described the new dating feature as a tool to build \u201creal long-term relationships \u2013 not just hookups\u201d. \u201cWe want Facebook to be somewhere where you can start meaningful relationships,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve designed this with privacy and safety in mind from the beginning.\u201d The announcement sparked gasps from the crowd and seemed to attract the most interest from the audience during Zuckerberg\u2019s short speech, which focused on the company\u2019s widening privacy scandal, new safeguards meant to protect users\u2019 data and misinformation and fake news on the site. Chris Cox, the chief product officer, said the dating feature would be \u201copt-in\u201d and \u201csafe\u201d and that the company \u201ctook advantage of the unique properties of the platform\u201d. Soon after the announcement, Mandy Ginsberg, the CEO of Match Group, which owns Tinder, threw shade at Facebook, saying in a statement: \u201cWe\u2019re surprised at the timing given the amount of personal and sensitive data that comes with this territory.\u201d Cox showed a user\u2019s hypothetical dating profile, which he said would be separate from an individual\u2019s regular profile, accessed in a different section of the site. The dating feature would use only a first name and only be visible to those using the service, not an individual\u2019s Facebook friends. The feature would not show up in the news feed, he added. Cox said users of this feature could browse and \u201cunlock\u201d local events and message others planning to attend. If a potential date responded, the two would then connect via a text messaging feature that is not connected to WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger. \u201cWe like this by the way because it mirrors the way people actually date, which is usually at events and institutions they\u2019re connected to,\u201d Cox said. \u201cWe hope this will help more folks meet and hopefully find partners.\u201d The sample profiles displayed at the conference resembled some basic features of Tinder. Shares of Match, which also owns OkCupid and Match.com, fell by 21% after Zuckerberg announced the new feature, according to Bloomberg. IAC, Match\u2019s parent company, which saw a nearly 14% drop in shares, also took a swipe at Facebook, with a joke about Russian propaganda on the site. Its CEO, Joey Levin, said in a statement: \u201cCome on in. The water\u2019s warm. Their product could be great for US/Russia relationships.\u201d Ginsberg, from Match, also said \u201cTinder continues to skyrocket\u201d and that the company was \u201cflattered that Facebook is coming into our space\u201d, adding, \u201cWe understand this category better than anyone. Facebook\u2019s entry will only be invigorating to all of us.\u201d A spokesperson for Bumble, another dating app that recently stopped requiring users to log in through Facebook, said the company was \u201cthrilled when we saw today\u2019s news\u201d and had already reached out to Facebook: \u201cPerhaps Bumble and Facebook can join forces to make the connecting space even more safe and empowering.\u201d The CEO noted that one in three marriages in the US now started online. He said couples who met on Facebook have repeatedly thanked him over the years. Zuckerberg said: \u201cThese are some of the moments that I\u2019m really proud of what we\u2019re doing. I know that we\u2019re making a positive difference in people\u2019s lives.\u201d The announcement of the dating feature came after Zuckerberg acknowledged that it has been a particularly \u201cintense\u201d year for the company, following revelations that millions of Americans\u2019 personal data was harvested from Facebook and improperly shared with the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
