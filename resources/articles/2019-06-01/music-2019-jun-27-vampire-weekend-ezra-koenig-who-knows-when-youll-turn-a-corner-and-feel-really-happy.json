Even platinum-selling musicians. \u201cIt\u2019s like being in some weird medieval village,\u201d says Ezra Koenig, frontman of Vampire Weekend, who had played Glastonbury three times with the band before going as a punter in 2014, when it finally clicked. \u201cI stayed up all night and understood: this is very special. I can\u2019t think of many festivals where there are old hippies who do their thing and keep to themselves, and keep that spirit of the 60s alive with arts and crafts. And there\u2019s all the secret stuff you find in the woods, the various raves, little mini pubs everywhere ... Everybody\u2019s walking through the mud and there\u2019s a real communal energy to it. Probably a lot of them are on drugs, too.\u201d His band are playing their biggest-ever slot at this year\u2019s festival, Sunday night on the Pyramid stage just before the Cure\u2019s headline performance. They released their fourth \u2013 and best \u2013 album Father of the Bride in May, and like the previous two, it went to No 1 in the US and Top 3 in the UK. It came six years after the last one, Modern Vampires of the City, with Koenig having taken creative control after fellow songwriter Rostam Batmanglij left the band. What has he been doing in the interim, apart from presumably contemplating how massive the universe is from a field in Somerset? \u201cAfter three albums, things were threatening to become a little bit too professional for my taste,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen things get up and running, you are quite literally a company. You can reach this place where the marketing outpaces the creativity \u2013 it kind of feels like rolling the new car off the assembly line. I needed a few years to go back to feeling and acting like an amateur.\u201d He wrote an anime series, Neo Yokio, which starred Jaden Smith and Jude Law; he also fell in love with the actor and director Rashida Jones, and they had a child. Koenig is at pains to point out the album was written before the kid came along. \u201cAlmost everything that\u2019s been written about the album references my girlfriend and our baby, and I\u2019m, like, I understand why, but \u2026\u201d He makes a frustrated \u201cgnnnn\u201d sound. \u201cThe timeline! Come on!\u201d It\u2019s the response of a man who, schooled in English and creative writing at New York\u2019s prestigious Columbia University, has always been hyper-aware of how his band are portrayed. We\u2019re in a hotel bedroom that, being in London, is not big enough even for two chairs. Koenig, chic and handsome, sits cross-legged in the middle of a bed like the founder of a mindfulness app. The 35-year-old\u2019s self-awareness stretches back to the band\u2019s breakout in 2007, playing peppy guitar-pop influenced by west African highlife in preppy polo shirts and shorts. They were provocative in the slightly priggish manner of the well-educated, cocking a snook at the denim and leathers of the New York guitar bands that had come before them and flaunting their upper middle-class status. Blogs bristled. \u201cThe conflict we engendered was performative class conflict,\u201d Koenig says in perfect academese. \u201cDeep down these people\u201d \u2013 their then critics \u2013 \u201cdon\u2019t care. Because real class conflict would be somebody saying: let\u2019s really talk about this, about what percentage of critically acclaimed buzz bands come from privileged backgrounds. I promise you I wouldn\u2019t place in the Top 30 in terms of intergenerational wealth. Maybe Top 50, but not Top 30.\u201d What about calling a song Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa \u2013 in a world that\u2019s more aware of cultural appropriation, doesn\u2019t that now seem gauche? \u201cIf that song came out today we\u2019d have just called it Cape Cod and slightly changed the arrangement, and nobody would have said anything,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no easy answers, but you have to be thoughtful about it. There\u2019s times when criticism helps you to be more thoughtful, and there\u2019s times when it\u2019s bad-faith clickbait. There are horror stories in terms of the way black musicians were treated and ripped off, and there are stories of black and white musicians creating music together that was part of a greater dialogue.\u201d It would be in pretty bad faith to say Koenig isn\u2019t in the latter category \u2013 he tracked down the son of Sierra Leonean \u201cpalm wine\u201d musician SE Rogie to clear a sample on Father of the Bride, featured funk prodigy Steve Lacy on two tracks, and co-wrote Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Hold Up, a typically pop-culturally aware contribution that reworked a Yeah Yeah Yeahs lyric. Those Ralph Lauren polos, so irritating to some indie rockers, were another bit of cultural commentary, this time on Koenig\u2019s Jewish heritage. \u201cI was like: don\u2019t they understand that, for east coast Jews, Ralph Lauren is a really funny figure? He\u2019s this guy from the Bronx who changed his last name. I tried to explain that, and for some people it went in one ear and out the other. Maybe it is asking too much of people to get into the hyper-specific identity politics of Jewish people.\u201d Well, maybe, especially on your fifth afternoon cider. \u201cI wish people would look at it through the lens I look at it through, but maybe no artist can really expect that.\u201d Father of the Bride closes with the elegant ballad Jerusalem, New York, Berlin. It references the Balfour declaration of 1917, which saw Britain set out Palestine as a home for the Jewish people. \u201cI know I loved you then, I think I love you still / But this prophecy of ours has come back dressed to kill,\u201d Koenig sings, setting his Jewish cultural pride against the infernal perpetual motion of the Israel-Palestine conflict. I ask him to explain, and he is initially a little evasive. \u201cEvery identity has some degree of tension between victimhood and supremacy, nationalism and ... whatever the opposite of nationalism is.\u201d He remembers a campaign at Columbia that accused Arab professors of antisemitism. \u201cHaving had personal experience [of antisemitism], I had an emotional attachment. But I was looking at the whole thing, and I could also relate to professors speaking their mind.\u201d Perhaps there aren\u2019t enough people who are so equitable. \u201cClearly not. But I don\u2019t know if I was a politician I would be able to do that \u2013 it\u2019s easy enough being a musician and just getting to think about things. You don\u2019t have to answer any questions, all you do is pose them. \u201cI like to take the broad view \u2013 that all of these identities we hold so dear are blips on the radar of human history, and whatever ethnicity or religion we call ourselves, at some point an ancestor was probably forcibly converted, or would have had their family murdered. And now we call ourselves a proud member of the group. It\u2019s funny.\u201d He checks himself. \u201cIt\u2019s not funny, it\u2019s complex.\u201d The broad view narrows, though, when he talks himself around to the topic of the American Jewish community. \u201cAmerica has a duty to be an honest broker,\u201d he says. \u201cSo if the whole Judaeo-Christian community is building some sick alliance out of Islamophobia, then I can\u2019t stomach that. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to go serve in the military when I\u2019m 18, or to have had family members who were murdered when a bus blew up in Tel Aviv. But I do know what it\u2019s like to be a Jewish person who grows up in New Jersey. So when I see a Jewish person who grew up in New Jersey talking about what the military needs to do and how evil the Palestinians are, I can easily put myself in their shoes and say: shut up. That is where the vast majority of my ire comes from. I can conclusively say: I don\u2019t agree with you, I think you\u2019re saying horrible things, I think your lack of empathy for the Palestinians is disgusting.\u201d It\u2019s not just politics that gets studied in Father of the Bride, but pop itself. It knowingly collides different tropes from across history: country music duets, jam bands, Laurel Canyon hippy folk, metropolitan guitar pop \u00e0 la Paul Simon. \u201cI write about romantic relationships, but that\u2019s partially just because it\u2019s a songwriting convention,\u201d he says. You can imagine him sending Rashida a Valentine\u2019s card, but only to poke fun at the heteronormative rituals of love. Any postmodern cleverness is, however, made tuneful enough to wave a flag to at the Pyramid stage, and Koenig has learned to embrace the simplicity of the best pop. \u201cA good Dolly Parton song gets at the ambiguity of the world way better than a song filled with strange images and expensive words does.\u201d He compares the man who wrote Father of the Bride\u2019s downbeat My Mistake with his younger \u201caccusatory\u201d self, \u201cthis person navigating this world: people who are more pretentious than me, assholes who want to take me down, idiots who try to tell me what to do, and people who treat me badly in relationships. Now that I\u2019m older, a song like My Mistake seems more emotionally interesting to me: maybe it\u2019s my own expectations that are what are bringing me misery, rather than you.\u201d For a band so associated with sun and shorts, there\u2019s as much melancholy in Koenig\u2019s songwriting, triggered by \u201crelationship breakdowns, and then sometimes just depression and anxiety creeping up. That feeling of: did I do or say something that I can never fix, that\u2019s going to haunt me for the rest of my life? Anybody who has dealt with depression and anxiety, which I think is most people, knows that it doesn\u2019t have to be manslaughter to keep you up at night.\u201d So, what keeps him up at night? \u201cAnxiety about professional decisions, and then sometimes stuff you can\u2019t always put your finger on. Rather than being surprised at moments when there\u2019s professional success but personal emptiness, now it\u2019s almost to be expected.\u201d But equally, \u201cwho knows when you\u2019ll turn a corner and feel really happy?\u201d Koenig, then, has become as attuned to his emotions as he always was to the culture around him. He riffs engagingly on how indie-rock has waned: where once hipsters had thrilled to the Strokes or, later, Animal Collective, now they\u2019re into rap, alt-R&amp;B and deconstructed club music, and Koenig says he was glad to be on his sabbatical when the shift happened. \u201cFor a lot of people participating in music then, that was a stressful time, an existential crisis. But a few years later, the vibe was not so much this big existential question, because to me there\u2019d been an answer. Is rock dead? Yes. Are guitar bands relevant? Not particularly. And I enjoyed the straightforwardness of that.\u201d He is amused and interested by the honesty of the fashion industry, and its acknowledgment of human caprice. \u201cThat industry has a straightforwardness: it\u2019s called \u2018fashion\u2019! There\u2019s no question about cycles. How come the person who did the same thing year-to-year is not getting the same praise as the person who changed things? Because that\u2019s how it works. How come the person who is bringing back something from 20 years ago is getting praise? Because that\u2019s how it works.\u201d His real talent is in making music that shrugs at taste. \u201cThe gods aren\u2019t showing much favour to guitar music, but that makes playing guitar scales at home even more kind of joyful and cool to me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s pretentious to say, but there\u2019s a line from [Roman philosopher] Cato that I always liked: \u2018The winning cause pleases the gods, but the losing cause pleases Cato.\u2019 And I\u2019m like: I feel you Cato!\u201d Easy for a chart-topping musician to say, but you already know he knows that, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
