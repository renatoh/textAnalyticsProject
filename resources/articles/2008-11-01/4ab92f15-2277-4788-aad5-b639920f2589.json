Even the woes of the US housing market are being blamed on financial \"innovation\" that enabled far too much money to be borrowed. But what about the real economy? Politicians are so worried that they are trying to outdo each other by offering tax cuts, and certainly these cuts are worth a try. But the task being given to tax cuts is herculean if they are meant to offset consumers' lack of willingness to use their credit cards to spend, and lenders' lack of willingness to lend. The real issue is that resuming \"spending as normal\" is almost impossible. The problem is that it is not just the financial world that is over-extended, it is consumers too. Yesterday, little noticed, American Express joined the long line of once-great financial institutions that have gone to the Federal Reserve of the United States cap in hand, desperate for money. Like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley before them, they first had to be given permission to turn themselves into a commercial bank. The usual one-month application procedure was waived in the interests of financial stability: Amex is now a bank, and it, too, can get emergency funding. What is happening at American Express provides a salutary lesson. Their non-repaying customers are on the rise, having doubled in the past year. As unemployment increases, many people are finding it more difficult to pay their credit card bills, causing big problems for the credit card companies. Likewise, those that survived by moving their debt from one credit card to the next are finding this a trickier game to play. Investors are worried about credit cards: for the first time since 1993, Amex was unable to raise money for its business by selling bonds; it is most certainly feeling the pinch. For Amex, borrowing from the Fed is now a necessity, not a luxury. But unfortunately, the problem goes much deeper. The supposed economic miracle we have witnessed in the past 30 years has come at a cost. That cost is a huge pile of debt. According to national statistics in the UK, household disposable income rose by a multiple of 6.4 between 1979 and 2005. But consumer credit is now 35 times bigger than it was in 1979. Then, consumer credit \u2013 overdrafts, credit cards and unsecured loans \u2013 represented 4.8% of household disposable income. By 2005 this had risen to 26.3%. The magic ingredient behind our economic growth has been debt. Total household debt (including mortgages) is now over one and a half times the size of the economy; it was under 90% in 1987. And before we comfort ourselves with the knowledge that the largest part of this debt is mortgages, money borrowed against (formerly) rising house prices, it is worth remembering that between 1999 and 2005, 40% of mortgage lending was remortgages; borrowings that often found their way on to the high street. In the past 30 years, in the over-consuming Anglo-Saxon economies, we have chosen not to worry about our debts because we imagined that upon retirement we would be able to trade down to a smaller house and pocket huge gains from house price rises. Many people see their house as their pension. But to a great extent this is an illusion: the UK is getting older and we can't all trade down at the same time. Moreover, we now know that the house price rises that gave us so much comfort were strongly influenced by a banking policy designed to encourage home ownership and lending to anyone, deposit or not. Those who wanted to save first were always the losers. It was always better to borrow and buy now. But that game could not go on forever. At some point debts have to be repaid. So if we do not want our children and grandchildren to be supporting us and paying off our debts for us, we have to come up with a more sustainable way of increasing employment in the future. Managing an economic crisis is one thing, and planning tax cuts to help struggling consumers is all well and good, but realising that economic policy should not base itself on rising house prices and the availability of consumer credit is another. I hope that governments, economists and policymakers around the world put as much thought into that as they have into bailing out the banks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
