I still work as acting team leader, but my day consists of a bit of everything from allocating cases to the team, care managers, home care, and the occupational therapist, and dealing with general phone inquiries. Because we are so busy it is only fair I get involved in all general tasks. Perth and Kinross is currently piloting a health and social care partnership. When I access a client's records I can now see both the health and social care workers assigned to their case. This is a great way of sharing information between the professions but it is demanding, mastering a new computer system on top of doing your job. A massive amount of work has been generated by the introduction of free personal care legislation [in Scotland] last July. We now undertake assessments for older people to establish if they are entitled to financial help towards the cost of care either in care homes or in their own homes. I feel we did not get enough support to deal with the extra work, but we are still trying to adjust. My pay has not changed since last year. I only get \u00a350 per month more than when I was care manager, but you can't just look at it in monetary terms. This job is not about the money; I enjoy the work and want to take my team forward. I still feel slightly undervalued as a team leader. The main difference is that there is less recognition for what you do. As care manager, families would see that you had worked hard for them; as team leader you are more in the background. For the first time in six years we have had to introduce a waiting list for people to see a care manager. I feel uncomfortable making people wait for this service and my view is that future crises may be averted if social workers step in quickly. I think the key is taking time to explain to people the pressures we are under. I recently replied to a letter of complaint and highlighted the fact that because our staff often work under such pressure it is beneficial for all concerned to manage the stress by distributing the case load, to prevent it interfering with the service we provide. Public voices: March 21 2002 Social worker, Kinross Salary: \u00a325,000 Since January, after our team leader went on secondment to another area, I've been acting team leader. I'm on a temporary contract which will be reviewed after 6 months. After 5 years as a care manager working with vulnerable adults, the change has been quite significant. I now supervise our 14 staff working in Kinross, I have to authorise budgets, even small things like being responsible for the security of the building. Because this is a rural office, I've always felt that I had a lot of autonomy, but there is a difference knowing that you're coming in to do it every day. I don't feel quite as valued now, in the sense that people often come to a team leader with unrealistic expectations and are disappointed if you can't resolve the problem immediately. My own colleagues have faith in me, but you have to be seen to be representing them. Again, it's an expectation that wasn't there before. I have kept on some clients, but I don't feel that I'm giving them the service I was before because most of my time's taken up with management. I have mixed feelings about going into management full-time. I feel that I'm a good practitioner and some times I feel that I'm wasting my time in meetings. Then again, as a manager I'm also bringing the needs of my clients to a higher authority. The pay is still fine, though we have been hit by cut-backs over the last year. We now have to book out pool cars, rather than claiming back the mileage on our own cars, and sometimes it's not that easy to plan ahead. But generally, morale remains reasonably high. Libby Brooks The Common Good: March 21 2001 Social worker, Kinross Salary: \u00a320,000 I work as a care manager with vulnerable adults in Kinross, and I've been doing this job for 5 years. I'm allocated cases as they come in - people are referred for all sorts of reasons: dementia, alcohol-related problems, mental health, young people with brain injuries, poverty. I'll be handling an average of 35 to 40 cases at any one time, and 85 per cent of my work is with older people. I've been working with this age-group for 19 years, and I can't see myself doing anything else. Over the years I've realised how vulnerable and lacking a voice many of them are, and how important it is to assist them in living the remainder of their life in comfort. But it's always a two-way thing - I enjoy what I get from them too. Working in a rural office with only 14 colleagues, it's a very supportive environment, more personal and less hierarchical than a bigger office. I earn \u00a320,000 per annum. I'm quite happy with what I'm paid for what I do. One element of the assessments I have to do is financial. I have to establish quite quickly what funds people have available to them. This is the most difficult part of the job. Probing about money can really affect the working relationship, especially with older people who value their privacy so much. Management of time is the biggest problem. A lot of my work is crisis intervention, so I could get a call this afternoon and I'm expected to drop everything else. I've learnt that you need to be careful not to react to other people's panic. My priority is to make sure that the individual is safe, but a lot of the job involves dealing with their family, and listening to their concerns. People can be quite patronising when they hear that you're a social worker - they say, \"Oh, that must be a hard job\". But when people actually see what we can put together, the feedback is much more positive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
