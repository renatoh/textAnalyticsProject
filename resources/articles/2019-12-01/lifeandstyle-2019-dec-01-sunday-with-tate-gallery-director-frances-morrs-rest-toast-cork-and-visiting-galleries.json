I\u2019m up between half eight and half nine; there\u2019s no alarm for a change. I stay in bed, indulging in the news and reviews from the weekend\u2019s papers. I pull things out and scribble stuff down. Do you breakfast or brunch? Rarely. I\u2019m always thinking about my weight. Occasionally I\u2019ll go for toast at Stockwell Continental, my go-to place. Do you work? I\u2019m often travelling or preparing for the week, but Sundays offer a time for reflection. How important is fresh air? I spend some Sundays on Mersea Island, near Colchester. It\u2019s just my mother now, since my father died. We go for a walk on the beach, swim, sail \u2013 weather permitting. I only exercise outside, never in the gym. Then it will be time for lunch at the Company Shed \u2013 they serve the best seafood. Do you visit the Tate? I like going as a punter, but when you know all the people working it\u2019s impossible to be invisible. Sundays are perfect for people-watching in the exhibitions. I love to see how people interact with our galleries. I don\u2019t have time to during the week. Do you shop? Not on a Sunday. Our lives are so ruined by shopping and spending, I need a day off from making those choices. Last thing you check on your phone? I try not to, but obviously it\u2019s Instagram. I\u2019m interested in responses to the works of art I upload, to see what captures people\u2019s imagination. It gives me an insight into what might work as a future exhibition. Where on a Sunday are you happiest? On Heir Island, off the coast of West Cork, Ireland. That\u2019s where my heart is. I\u2019ve been holidaying there since I was six years old. It\u2019s my place of escape: the wildness, the salt in the air, the absence of stress. It feels like home, the closest thing that I\u2019ve ever had to continuity. Nam June Paik runs until 9 February at Tate Modern"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
