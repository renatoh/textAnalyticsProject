The proceedings could result in the president\u2019s removal from office \u2013 but that is seen as unlikely. Here\u2019s what will happen next: Senate votes on ground rules The Senate must vote on a resolution laying out ground rules for the trial including who the key players will be, how long they will get to present their cases and other matters. The majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has said he has the votes to open the trial without an immediate provision for witness testimony, which could be secured later during the trial. However, McConnell said he did not have the votes to dismiss the impeachment articles out of hand. Senate trial After the oath, the trial proper will begin \u2013 although there could be a short adjournment to allow the sides to prepare. Impeachment managers will make their case, to be followed by the defense. Senators may not speak during the proceedings but may submit written questions to the chief justice who would cause them to be read. The question of witnesses and other matters would be decided on the fly by majority vote. A time limit for the proceedings will be established in the initial Senate vote. Evidence examination Both the prosecution and defence may \u2013 in theory, depending on the rules agreed for the trial \u2013 bring in witnesses, who may be examined and cross-examined. The former national security adviser John Bolton and former vice-president Joe Biden have both said that they would be prepared to testify if subpoenaed. The Senate may try to alter the parameters of the evidence under examination by putting forward a motion to restrict or increase it. Closing arguments The prosecution and the defence will put forward their final statements, with the House managers going last, giving the House of Representatives the first and last word. Deliberation The senators deliberate on the case. In the past this has happened behind closed doors and out of public view. But that\u2019s open to change, too. Final vote The senators vote separately on the two articles of impeachment \u2013 the first charging Trump with abuse of power, the second charging him with obstruction of Congress. A two-thirds majority of present senators \u2013 67 ayes if everyone votes \u2013 on either article would be enough to convict Trump and remove him from office. But that would require about 20 Republican defections and is unlikely. The more likely outcome is a Trump acquittal, at which point the process is concluded, barring some highly unusual development such as the House taking action to impeach Trump again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
