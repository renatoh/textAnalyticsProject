As a child, Elza Soares always liked listening to their buzz \u2013 the noise reminded her of her own raspy register \u2013 and she tried to emulate them with her voice. Then, when carrying buckets of water on her head to and from her house, she realised she could actually sing. \u201cWhen I picked them up, I\u2019d groan and, eventually, I realised that gave off a [musical] sound. So, I continued doing it: carrying the buckets and singing.\u201d Now 90 \u2013 though accounts vary, and even she isn\u2019t sure of her age \u2013 Soares has evolved those buzzes and groans into one of Brazil\u2019s most revered voices. Born in a favela slum in Rio de Janeiro to a washerwoman and a factory worker around 1930, she has recorded 36 studio albums, performed at the 2016 Olympic opening ceremony in Rio, and was voted the greatest singer of the last millennium by the BBC in 1999. She has released a string of singles this year \u2013 the newest is out this month, with the band Tit\u00e3s \u2013 and still can\u2019t bear to imagine a life without singing: \u201cGod forbid!\u201d Soares is calling from her seaside apartment in Copacabana. When we meet via Zoom, I get a flash of bright red nails when her hand pops into the frame, and as always her expressive, almond shaped eyes are glamorously made up. The upstairs neighbours are renovating, and she\u2019s trying to tell me how she\u2019s doing when we\u2019re interrupted by a loud, thumping sound. \u201cIt\u2019s never-ending,\u201d she says, slightly annoyed. But otherwise, she\u2019s in a good mood. \u201cI\u2019m doing great,\u201d she says. \u201cI live a peaceful life, man. I don\u2019t leave the house. I exercise, listen to music. That\u2019s how I spend my days.\u201d It\u2019s a long way from the favela, but when I ask about her childhood, she assures me: \u201cI remember everything.\u201d She and her mother would listen to songs on the radio together, while father played the guitar and sang, \u201cand I\u2019d sing with him \u2013 it was beautiful. I grew up in a very poor, modest household. But it was also a really loving, healthy, happy place.\u201d Soares clearly prefers to hold on to her fonder memories \u2013 she won\u2019t elaborate on the tougher times in her youth. At 12, her father forced her into a marriage with a local boy after he saw them fighting and assumed he\u2019d raped her. By 13, she\u2019d given birth to her first child, and at 21 she\u2019d already mothered seven children, two of whom died young. In 1953, Soares went on a radio talent show, looking to make some money to buy medicine for her son. At first, the host made fun of her (she was dressed in tattered clothes that looked far too big on her small frame), but by the time she had finished singing, he\u2019d already deemed her a star. It was only in 1960, however, after a brief stint in Argentina and some time spent singing in bars around Rio, that she got her first record deal. That same year, her rendition of Lupic\u00ednio Rodrigues\u2019 Se Acaso Voc\u00ea Chegasse became a hit, cementing her status as Brazil\u2019s samba queen. Nowadays, she tends to distance herself from the label. \u201cLook, samba is the root of all virtue, right? Samba is what got me started. But I think, if you can sing, you have to sing everything. You can\u2019t let yourself get pigeonholed into a single rhythm.\u201d She says it always bothered her when people made assumptions about what she could and couldn\u2019t do based on her race: \u201cBecause I was black, because I had a nice body, [people thought] I had to sing samba. But no, I had to sing everything.\u201d Why change things up so often? \u201cBecause of course [you should]! You can\u2019t be stuck in time.\u201d Within the last decade, she\u2019s branched out into countless other styles, and collaborated with a number of young Brazilian artists, from rapper and singer Fl\u00e1vio Renegado, to Kiko Dinucci (of Met\u00e1 Met\u00e1), to members of the Afrobeat group Bixiga 70. Lyrically, her recent work is grittier and more political than ever. In Maria da Vila Matilde, a song on her 2016 album The Woman at the End of the World, she cautions an abuser against hitting her again, telling him: \u201cYou\u2019re going to regret raising your hand at me.\u201d Likewise, her two most recent releases, Deus \u00e9 Mulher and Planeta Fome are rich with social commentary, on topics ranging from racism to class inequality and LGBTQ+ rights. So it strikes me as odd when I ask for her thoughts on Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Soares quickly dismisses me: \u201cI don\u2019t talk about politics.\u201d Why? \u201cBecause it\u2019s not my style. I\u2019m already engaged with politics. I am political.\u201d She has a point \u2013 with that range of social issues, her music arguably speaks for itself \u2013 but she does offer one piece of advice: \u201cThe main problem with Brazilians is that they need to learn how to vote. Once we do that, things will be better.\u201d Ever the optimist, Elza is inclined to think things will change for the better, in spite of everything she has been through \u2013 later in life, she\u2019d go on to lose another son, a child she had from her marriage to football star Man\u00e9 Garrincha. When I ask what\u2019s kept her going all these years, creatively and personally, she doesn\u2019t miss a beat: \u201cOther people inspire me.\u201d She tells me singing makes her feel \u201calive, because it means I get to spread joy. Singing motivates me. It feels like giving birth; like sharing a piece of your happiness, of your voice. I sing for everyone.\u201d Soares still has a full day ahead of her, but before we hang up, her manager asks if I want to see the view. He flips the camera around so it faces the bustling street outside. Soares tells me she loves to sit and sunbathe \u2013 often \u201cin the nude\u201d \u2013 by the window. \u201cI look at the sky, the ocean, water, people \u2013 it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she says. \u201cTotal freedom.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
