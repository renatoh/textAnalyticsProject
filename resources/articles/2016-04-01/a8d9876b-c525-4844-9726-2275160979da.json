The protest follows outrage over the rape case of sophomore Madi Barney, 19, who reported to Provo, Utah, police that she was raped in her off-campus apartment during a date. According to police documents viewed by the Salt Lake Tribune, Barney claims the perpetrator, 39-year-old Nasiru Seidu, lied about his age, name, and marital status, and that he raped her while she cried out and screamed \u2018no\u2019. The Tribune said the police confirmed those details during a staged phone call between Barney and Seidu after she filed the report. A Utah County sheriff\u2019s deputy, who was friends with the accused, then sent Barney\u2019s police case file to BYU and, two months after her attack, she was summoned to the honor code office for a disciplinary hearing. \u201cWe have received information that you have been a victim of behavior that is addressed in the university Sexual Misconduct Policy,\u201d a BYU official wrote to her in December, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. \u201cWe have also received information that you have engaged in behavior that violates the BYU Honor Code. I would like to meet with you and provide you with the information that we have received and give you an opportunity to respond.\u201d Barney went public with her case last week, and a petition she drafted demanding BYU grant victims of sexual assault immunity from honor code punishments has since garnered over 90,000 signatures. Citing safety concerns, Barney\u2019s supporters said she could not attend Wednesday\u2019s protest, but they delivered the petition on her behalf to a representative of BYU president Kevin Worthen. They wore teal armbands, a symbol of solidarity with assault victims, and carried placards that read, \u201cProtect victims, don\u2019t shame them.\u201d A fellow rape survivor, Brooke Swallow, said, \u201cDissension is a Mormon value. We need dissension and dissidents in this culture so we can effect change.\u201d Under the counsel of her attorney, Barney declined to participate in the school hearing, claiming it would complicate her legal case. The university has since blocked her from registering for new classes, she told the Salt Lake Tribune. And when she tried to retroactively withdraw from two courses she struggled in due to frequent court appearances and other aspects of the investigation, Barney\u2019s request was denied because, according to her account, administrators said they \u201ccan\u2019t prove the rape occurred\u201d. Barney did not respond to a message from the Guardian seeking comment. She has filed an official complaint to US Department of Education, according to the Tribune, saying BYU denied her services that under federal law should be available to sexual assault victims in accordance with Title IX, the gender equity rule that requires schools to address reports of sexual assault and harassment. The university claimed to be meeting Title IX compliance standards when it began investigating Barney\u2019s case. In a Facebook post announcing Wednesday\u2019s protest, Barney noted that by reporting sex crimes, victims like her expose themselves to potential probation, suspension or even expulsion. \u201cNothing a survivor does makes rape or any sexual assault OK,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBy investigating victims for violations of the honor code, BYU is revictimizing those who come forward and blaming them for what happened.\u201d The Department of Education warned universities in a 2011 letter about the \u201cchilling effect\u201d that disciplinary policies may have \u201con victims\u2019 or other students\u2019 reporting of sexual violence offenses\u201d. \u201cSchools should be aware that victims or third parties may be deterred from reporting incidents if alcohol, drugs, or other violations of school or campus rules were involved.\u201d In response to the uproar Barney\u2019s case has inspired, Worthen issued a statement on Monday promising to \u201cstudy\u201d the relationship between its Title IX office and honor code office. \u201cSometimes in the course of an investigation, facts come to light that a victim has engaged in prior Honor Code violations. The university recognizes the inherent tension, in some circumstances, in these two important parts of BYU\u2019s efforts to create and maintain an atmosphere consistent with the ideals and principles of the Church,\u201d the statement read. \u201cIn all Honor Code proceedings, the university strives for fairness, sensitivity and compassion, taking into account all mitigating facts and circumstances.\u201d The school\u2019s announcement did not impress Kelsey Bourgeois, an organizer from the petition network Care2 and a former BYU student. She told the Guardian, \u201cIt seems more like they are trying to get this bad press to go away versus really committing to making a change. \u201cJust saying they\u2019re going to \u2018study it\u2019 isn\u2019t really enough.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
