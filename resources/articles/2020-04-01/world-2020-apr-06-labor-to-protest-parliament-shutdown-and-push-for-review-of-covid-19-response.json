There will be a strong push for a parliamentary committee with powers to review and assess government measures responding to the pandemic. The attorney general, Christian Porter, on Monday bluntly told the opposition that MPs had \u201cbetter things to do\u201d than sit in parliament. Porter, who is also government leader in the House of Representatives, told ABC radio on Monday: \u201cWhat is the point of that? \u201cIf people want to sit out there during the greatest economic crisis Australia\u2019s experienced and read practice and procedure of the House of Representatives, good luck to them. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got better things to do.\u201d But the independent senator Jacqui Lambie said the parliament should be recalled as soon as possible and \u201cas soon as it is safe to do so\u201d. She told Guardian Australia on Monday: \u201cWe should set down some dates and times. \u201cThis idea the government has of calling us in on a whim, whenever they feel they need, it\u2019s not the most functional. \u201cThey\u2019re spending billions of dollars, so it\u2019s time to apply a bit of scrutiny. We\u2019ve been very nice to the government, we\u2019ve played very nice. But with no parliament \u2013 is that a sustainable way for a democracy to go? No, it\u2019s not.\u201d Her stand was reflected in Australia Institute polling released on Monday showing 68% of voters wanted an oversight committee, similar to a body established in New Zealand. Just 13% of voters opposed the idea. Before it was suspended, the New Zealand parliament established a parliamentary committee including representatives of all political parties, which will publicly broadcast hearings. \u201cThis research indicates the Australian public\u2019s trust and confidence in the decisions of the government in this time of crisis would be enhanced by a powerful parliamentary oversight committee ,\u201d said Ben Oquist, the executive director of the Australia Institute. \u201cWhen decisions are being made so rapidly, often with imperfect information, a New Zealand style Covid-19 parliamentary oversight committee will go a long way to giving the public confidence in the decisions being made. \u201cAustralians are being asked to trade away significant civil liberties in the interests of public health. Increased public confidence in how these measures are being determined will go a long way to ensuring Australians take heed.\u201d The federal houses will return on Wednesday for what is expected to be a single sitting day, the first in 16 days. The relegation of parliament\u2019s importance will be highlighted by a meeting on Tuesday of the national cabinet of federal and state leaders, who have had at least two conferences a week for the past month. Labor and key crossbench MPs will call for a Senate committee to oversee Scott Morrison\u2019s response to the coronavirus, despite the strong backing in opinion surveys for the prime minister\u2019s performance. The Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick on Monday backed a proposal for more frequent sittings, with the government and opposition able to suspend the schedule for public health reasons. The manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, told reporters in Sydney there was a \u201chigh likelihood\u201d the proposed committee would be created with the backing of Labor, Centre Alliance, the Greens and Lambie. Burke said the committee is an \u201cimportant\u201d development but \u201cit doesn\u2019t of itself though override the importance of parliament meeting\u201d. He accused Porter of \u201cridiculing the importance\u201d of his own job, and noted that when parliament last sat it had not been characterised by Labor \u201csledges\u201d but \u201cquestions of detail that the Australian people wanted answers for\u201d. \u201cAt the moment, you\u2019ve got parliament behaving at its best. And the government\u2019s response is they\u2019d rather not have parliament,\u201d he said. The protest will contrast with Labor\u2019s support for changes to the Fair Work Act intended to efficiently distribute the $130bn jobkeeper payments. The opposition will argue for the payments to go to a wider group of casual workers but is expected to accept the government\u2019s final decision. It will be the first sitting of parliament since 23 March and MPs are not expected to be summoned back until 11 August. Parliaments have closed down around the country. The NSW parliament last sat on 24 March and is not scheduled to meet again until September. Tasmania\u2019s last met on 26 March and is not expected to return until August. The chambers of Queensland (18 March) and Victoria (19 March), the Northern Territory (24 March) and the ACT (2 April) have no scheduled return date. The parliaments of South Australia and Western Australia are still operating."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
