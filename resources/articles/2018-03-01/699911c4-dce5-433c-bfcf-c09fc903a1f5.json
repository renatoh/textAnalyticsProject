The brutality of the combat, the slashing of Hector\u2019s tendons, the severing of his fingers, the dragging of his bloodied corpse away from Troy, all served as dark totems of the savagery of war while reminding us that, for all his fine words about honour, Achilles is a killer to his core. While the unlucky Hector moved inexorably towards his fate, Paris continued to be unfairly blessed by the Gods. Not only was his suicide attempt thwarted by a passing bunch of Amazons, who chose to adopt him as a sort of bearded pet and help him get back to Troy rather than doing the sensible thing and leaving him to drown in his own self-importance, but Aphrodite also personally assured him that pesky curse business was now lifted and the men, women and children of Troy would survive and thrive. That news was naturally greeted with delight by the Trojan royal family, who (foolishly) began to think for the first time that they might actually win this lengthy war. The only person to remain unconvinced: Cassandra, who quite frankly appears to be a far better gauge of whether a city is cursed and going to fall than a capricious goddess who needs to be told that you\u2019d pick her a thousand times regardless of personal cost. The Greeks It was all about Achilles this week as his honour began to look increasingly tarnished. Firstly, his prolonged stand-off with Agamemnon allowed a small band of Trojans, led by Hector and Paris, to cut the supply lines and cause havoc in the Greek camp. This is turn led a frustrated Patroclus to don Achilles\u2019 armour and fight in his name with predictably terrible results. The death of Patroclus and Achilles\u2019 subsequent grief and blood-rage is one of most memorable parts of the Iliad and should feel like a punch to the gut. Unfortunately, despite all David Gyasi\u2019s considerable efforts \u2013 and I was particularly fond of the little speech about why love is weakness \u2013 Patroclus\u2019s death didn\u2019t carry anywhere near the weight that it should. The Gods While it was one of the strongest scenes of the episode, I\u2019m not sure I buy Aphrodite\u2019s convenient \u2018Oh, your heart stopped so technically you died and now the curse is lifted\u2019 explanation, which is a cop-out along the lines of Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cripped untimely from his mother\u2019s womb\u201d in Macbeth. However, I\u2019ll happily eat my words if it turns out that the whole point is that the gods are inherently untrustworthy and will say anything to ensure that you continue to worship them. I also thought that it was hinted that Hector\u2019s death was a payment of sorts \u2013 as Paris lived, so Hector must die, Aphrodite\u2019s favours/interventions could only stretch so far. Additional Omens Anyone who would like to read an alternative version of Patroclus\u2019s relationship with Achilles should try Madeline Miller\u2019s Orange prize-winning, Achilles. I don\u2019t think Agamemnon, Mr Fire and Fury, should take up counselling any time soon. I thought the fate of Pandarus was well-handled particularly the fact that Hector, rightly, couldn\u2019t believe he would be guilty of treachery. Also leaping to the top of my list of people I would keep alive on this show \u2013 Aeneas, a pragmatist who talks a great deal of sense. Worrying omen of the week Not an omen but I did love Penthesilia\u2019s response to Paris\u2019s story about his curse and the bad omens surrounding it \u2013 \u201cThere always is with boys like you\u201d. Indeed. Epic declaration of the week \u201cWhen the walls of Troy start to fall, and the chaos takes over there will be very little I can do to protect you, let me help you now,\u201d Xanthius continues to be one of the few people in Troy who understands how bad it might get. So what did you think? As always all speculation welcome below."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
