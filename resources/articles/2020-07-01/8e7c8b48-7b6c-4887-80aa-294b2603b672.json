Estimates by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that the UK higher education sector will endure losses ranging between \u00a33bn to \u00a319bn in 2020-21, with the exact size of the losses dependent on how many students decide not to enrol. The IFS calculates that pension obligations and investment losses caused by the economic downturn will also have a major impact on university balance sheets over the next four years. Universities will be unable to recoup their losses through cost-cutting unless they also make \u201csignificant\u201d numbers of staff redundant, the research found. Although the IFS did not name the 13 institutions most at risk, the authors suggest that those with the lowest reserves and smallest investments will need a government bailout or debt restructuring to survive. \u201cIt is not the institutions with the largest Covid-related losses that are at the greatest risk of insolvency. Rather it is those, generally less prestigious, institutions that entered the crisis in a weak financial position and with little in the way of net assets, which are at greatest risk,\u201d the IFS stated. Universities with the largest predicted losses under the IFS\u2019s analysis were \u201chighly profitable\u201d before the crisis and have substantial financial reserves, allowing them to sustain significant drops in income. \u201cIf the government wanted to avoid university insolvencies, by far the cheapest option would be a targeted bailout, which may cost just \u00a3140m,\u201d said the IFS\u2019s Elaine Drayton, one of the report\u2019s authors. \u201cRescuing failing institutions may weaken incentives for others to manage their finances prudently in the future. General increases in research funding avoid this problem but are unlikely to help the institutions that are most at risk, as few of them are research-active.\u201d Jo Grady, the general secretary of the University and College Union, said the IFS report was further bad news for students and staff in higher education. \u201cUniversities are already seeking to sack staff, with casual staff and those from black and minority ethnic backgrounds suffering the most. We need a comprehensive support package that protects jobs, preserves our academic capacity and guarantees all universities\u2019 survival,\u201d Grady said. The IFS\u2019s central projection calculates an \u00a311bn loss in income for the sector, with a 50% fall in new international students. It also assumes that enrolments from the EU will halve in 2020-21 \u201cdue to travel restrictions and disruption to administrative services \u2026 as well as health concerns,\u201d despite it being the final year that students within the EU are treated the same as UK applicants. The institute expects enrolments from the UK to be 10% lower as \u201csome students may choose not to attend what is likely to be a significantly different university experience or may stay away for health concerns\u201d. The downturn in financial markets will also likely hurt finances. The IFS estimates that universities will need to increase their pension provisions by 25%, while investment income is expected to fall by 10%. The IFS also offers two more scenarios, including a \u201cpessimistic\u201d scenario with \u00a319bn in lost income, thanks to much larger falls in student enrolments and a more severe market downturn widening pension fund deficits and reduced investment income. The \u201coptimistic\u201d scenario of a \u00a33bn loss includes a 25% fall in international and EU enrolments and no additional pension provisions required."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
