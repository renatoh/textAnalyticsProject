Mr Blair also told MPs that vaccinating birds infected with avian flu stopped them dying but did not halt the spread of disease and risked \"masking it\". At question time, the Conservative leader, David Cameron, challenged Mr Blair to say whether he was personally convinced that all necessary preparations had been made. The prime minister said the government was following expert advice from the chief veterinary officer and others. \"The reason why we have take the view against vaccination, on their advice, is that what they say is that vaccination is effective to stop birds dying but it is not effective in stopping the virus spreading. \"Therefore the worry has always been that if you vaccinate that you mask the disease, you do not actually stop it spreading.\" \"Yes I am satisfied, in so far as it is possible, that we have got all the necessary precautions in place.\" Mr Blair said it was important to maintain the right balance between ensuring the right precautions were in place and not unduly scaring the public. Meanwhile, it emerged today that a task force of scientists, doctors and industry experts is to look for new ways of tackling the threat of H5N1 bird flu. The group, launched today by the Royal Society and the Academy of Medical Sciences, aims to identify scientific evidence that can better inform policy makers on issues such as vaccination and predicting the spread of the disease. It is expected to publish its findings in the summer. \"This study will provide a timely analysis of the underlying science of avian and pandemic influenza,\" The group's chairman, Sir John Skehel - a fellow of both academies and director of the Medical Research Council's National Institute for Medical Research in London - said. \"The threat of an influenza pandemic is sufficient for the UK to prepare as well as it possibly can, both in terms of prevention and treatment. This includes understanding the threat through taking account of advances in scientific research carried out in the UK and in other countries. \"It's recognised by everybody who works in influenza that there are lots of things that we don't know. Although so far the policies of all countries, including the UK, have involved scientific input, there are still things that are being discovered. We want to be sure that we use as much expertise as we can to identify any of these gaps.\" Sir John said vaccination was one key area where new breakthroughs might be made. In particular, a vaccine that offered protection across numerous different strains was needed. Other members of the task force include Professor Neil Ferguson, an expert in infectious disease epidemiology at Imperial College London; Professor Andrew McMichael, from the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine at Oxford University; Professor Albert Osterhaus, from the Department of Virology at Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and Professor Barry Furr, former chief scientist at the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. Tomorrow, flu experts and policy makers from around the world are due to meet at a four-day conference in Sussex, to be held in closed session, to discuss how to improve international cooperation in the fight against bird flu. David Nabarro, the UN's coordinator for avian and human flu, and Michael Ryan, the World Health Organisation's head of epidemic and pandemic alert response, are among those expected to speak at the summit, organised by Wilton Park, an executive agency of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
