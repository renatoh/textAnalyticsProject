It\u2019s an elegant, angular campus satire with a little of Alexander Payne\u2019s dyspeptic Election \u2013 though the edge is slightly dulled by the final credits, particularly the final romantic pairing. Tessa Thompson plays Sam, a radical mixed-race woman who has a popular student-radio slot called Dear White People, mocking white liberals\u2019 pretensions. When she is unexpectedly voted student house leader, defeating her ex-boyfriend Troy (Brandon P Bell), this ambitious young man decides to pump up his CV by joining an all-white humour magazine with the appalling title of Pastiche, who are trying to think up a gimmick for their annual party. An anonymous troublemaker fires out a hoax invite with a \u201cLiberate Your Inner Negro\u201d theme, which is instantly taken up by all the casual racists, and the event becomes a scandal. It\u2019s reported on by the gay black would-be journalist Lionel Higgins (Tyler James Higgins), who complains his Afro has become a black hole for patronising white fingers. The movie\u2019s acidly knowing comment drains away as the romantic drama advances and resolves, but it\u2019s clever and entertaining."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
