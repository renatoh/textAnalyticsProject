The year is 1944 and the Germans have successfully invaded Britain: now a small Wehrmacht platoon has entered the remote Olchon valley in Wales on a top-secret mission. They discover that all the farms' menfolk have vanished to join a resistance movement, and their leader, Albrecht (Tom Wlaschiha) knows it is his duty to inform the Gestapo and await their brutal intervention. But wearied and sickened by war, and believing it to be almost over anyway, he lets it slide; his men help out on the farms; they wear the men's civilian clothes and Tom begins to fall in love with Sarah (Andrea Riseborough), the quietly desperate farmer's wife. There is a superbly surreal sequence at a nearby country livestock show \u2013 the same as peacetime, only with swastikas, Nazi officers, staff cars etc. This is an overwhelmingly bleak film, progressing with a dreamlike drift, and the howl of wind is a continuous accompaniment. There is little conventional suspense or action, just an undertone of violence, and a sense of hallucination and disorientation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
