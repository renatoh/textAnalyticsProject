But sterling hardly budged against the euro - and economists say it is 'illiterate' to link exchange and interest rates directly - trade and investment are equally important. Jeremy Woolridge, chief executive of West Midlands-based Wedge Group Galvanising, said: 'The impact is symbolic. It seems to be the first time the Bank of England has reacted to problems in manufacturing rather than to the strength of the service sector.' That is not to say he and his competitors in the UK's engineering and manufacturing sectors do not see substance to the move. David Jack of Japanese firm Mazak Machine Tools, based in Worcester, says that with 90 per cent of the company's output going to Europe, 'there has been a significant impact on short-term profitability' due to the exchange rate. In order to remain competitive, the company has had to add value to its products while keeping costs down. But Jack also points out that the currency did not move significantly in line with the rate cuts of 1999, and acknowledges that it does little to tackle the core problem - weakness in world trade. The same is true for the big manufacturing groups which have reported problems recently - Invensys, which talked of the worst trading conditions in the US for 30 years, and Marconi. The problem is trickling down: figures last week showed manufacturing insolvencies rising by 18 per cent in the second quarter. But some economists warn that cutting rates now could prejudice a UK manufacturing recovery on the back of a global one - if and when it materialises. Richard Jeffrey of ING Barings points to the increasing trade gap, which he believes is likely to widen as domestic demand is encouraged by lower rates. Domestic inflation may force rates to rise, harming UK manufacturers as world markets improve. Figures from the Office for National Statistics indicate that the trade gap in manufacturing grew from 1.9 per cent in 2000 to 2.06 per cent in the first quarter of this year. ONS expects the gap to widen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
