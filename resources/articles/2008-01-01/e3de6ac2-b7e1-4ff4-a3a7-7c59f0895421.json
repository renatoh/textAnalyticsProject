('Sure, it's cruel, but intensive farming feeds a real need', Comment last week). In dismissing Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's campaign for better-quality chicken as 'middle-class foodie culture', he misses two crucial points. First, 95 per cent of chickens sold in the UK have been intensively reared, so they are being bought by the vast majority of shoppers, not just those who can't afford to pay more. It is not 'sentimentality' to try to persuade those consumers to make a more informed choice. Second, it's highly questionable to argue that a second-rate food supply is good enough for the poor. Does Rayner really want a two-tier food system, where those on low incomes can only afford inferior produce, while the good stuff is the preserve of the affluent? The third way is to eat better-quality meat less often. Jane Middleton Bath Jay Rayner's justification for continuing the cruelty to chickens is untenable. The poverty he speaks of is relative. Nobody in this country, except the destitute, is too poor to feed themselves properly if they forgo what in the Fifties would have been regarded as luxuries. My pension income hovers around the official poverty level. Yet because I do not buy many luxuries and don't waste anything, I can afford wine with my meals, tobacco, adequate heating and a healthy diet that does not depend on free-range chicken. DW Hatton Glastonbury, Somerset Jay Rayner's article is the first common sense I've read all week in the debate on Fearnley-Whittingstall's TV show, Hugh's Chicken Run. Like Rayner, I've felt uncomfortable about the level of middle-class preaching I've heard on this issue. Let 'gentleman farmer' Fearnley-Whittingstall leave his Dorset abode and live on a single mother's benefits for a year. If he can then convince me it's possible to eat as he wishes - even from the 'cheaper cuts' he graciously allows us - I'll concede. As a single parent on a limited income, it galls me beyond belief to be preached to when the ability to change is made so difficult by pure economics. And we're not all simpletons either. Of course, dressing kids in designer, sweatshop-produced clothing and then filling them with cheap food is wrong. But has Fearnley-Whittingstall ever come across a child's need to be part of their group, to feel that they belong? Enjoy your roast, Hugh, and thank you, Jay, for moving this debate to reality. Laura Smith Northampton I find Mr Rayner's stance towards low-income families the worst kind of snobbery: he seems to imply that good food, produced to ethical standards, can only be the province of the well-off. Yet every family deserves a good, balanced diet. With rising levels of diabetes, heart disease and obesity, he should see the link between industrialising the food supply, the growing dominance of convenience foods and an increasing distance between the less well-informed shopper and good food. Andrew Kyle London W13 I invite Jay Rayner to make two egg-white omelettes, one with free range eggs and the other with the cheapest battery eggs. The battery version will taste of washing-up liquid. Our household is very probably in the bottom 5 per cent of Observer readers by household income, but we're still ready to cry 'enough!' Never less than the Freedom Food label for us, from now on. And full-blown free range, whenever I'm feeling flush enough. No farmers' Red Tractor logo? Sorry. Not good enough. Not good enough for the chickens and not good enough for me. Put it in the dustbin of history. IC Rogers Manchester"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
