The feeling was reinforced when injury-time began and the Republic's central defender made yet another vital intervention, thwarting Marek Mintal after Shay Given had been lured from his line. The Irish majority in the stands roared their approval. Sixty seconds later and Dunne was on his knees - those same fans choked into silence. Ireland know all about heartbreak but Marek Cech's equaliser cut them to the core. Dunne, having felt a nudge in his back before heading out as far as the onrushing left-back, could only watch the Slovak spear a low drive into the corner. Dunne sank to the turf. His towering performance did not deserve this brutal sting. Ireland's players tried to look on the bright side afterwards, and they had the material to do so. They pointed to the breezy football they played for the first half-hour, the character they showed after half-time to retake the lead through Kevin Doyle's 25-yard beauty, the openings they chiselled out, their desire and commitment. The unbeaten run under Steve Staunton now stands at five competitive matches, nine overall. And each player stressed that Ireland have long realised that they need to beat the Czech Republic in Prague on Wednesday to fire their hopes of qualification. Defeat in Bratislava on Saturday would have spelt the end and although the players felt as though they had lost, they continue to cling on. The stoicism could not mask the hurt, however, but yesterday they were cheered that another tie \"to put things right\" is on the horizon. They have resolved to band together and lift their spirits but as Dunne and Staunton acknowledged, the big issue concerns their capacity to learn lessons in time for Wednesday's game. Ireland dropped deeper after both of their goals in Slovakia, and their passing because less authoritative. Given made a string of saves during a torrid period after the half-hour before he was beaten by Maros Klimpl's header, following slack defending from a corner. They also missed chances in the second half. Staunton has spoken off changing the mentality of his team's football, emboldening it to add a ruthless streak, the hallmark of nations who qualify perennially. \"When you are away from home it is about the mindset,\" he said. \"It is natural to drop deep and [the lads] find it hard to get out of their own half, but I want to change the mentality. It was hard lesson but it's one we have to learn if we are going to have a winning mentality, home and away.\" On Wednesday the Czechs will be without their striker Jan Koller, who is suspended, while Stephen Ireland, scorer of the first goal for the Irish, has left the squad following the death of his grandmother."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
