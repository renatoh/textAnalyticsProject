It was a brief vision, but it was clear and will not be forgotten. The House met expecting to hear from Mr. Chamberlain a statement which would lead to the very brink of war. Mr. Chamberlain himself delivered the greater part of his speech expecting no other conclusion. Sir Horace Wilson, the last envoy of peace, had brought Mr. Chamberlain a message from Herr Hitler saying that German mobilisation was to start at 2p.m. to-day, and Mr. Chamberlain had been deeply impressed with Herr Hitler's determination. Yet in the last moments of his speech Mr. Chamberlain announced that Signor Mussolini had secured from Herr Hitler a postponement of the mobilisation order for twenty-four hours, and last of all that Herr Hitler had invited Mr. Chamberlain to meet him to-morrow at Munich. This news, which arrived during the course of the speech and was known only to a few Ministers, overwhelmed the House. All the Government supporters rose in their places to cheer the Prime Minister. Most Opposition members, however, remained seated. Order papers were waved. Mr. Chamberlain had not quite drained his cup of joy. \" Herr Hitler,\" he said, \"also invites Signor Mussolini and M. Daladier to meet him. I need hardly say what my answer will be.\" This last sentence, coming after Mr. Chamberlain's account of his excursions into a nightmare world, was almost too poignant to bear. Emotion found an outlet in another great demonstration of cheering and clapping. Mr. Chamberlain was able to say a little more. \"There can be no member of this House who did not feel his heart leap when we had been given once more an opportunity to try what reason can do instead of tearing men to pieces.\" Our Parliamentary Correspondent [Francis Boyd]. Leader Comment. In the swiftly changing circumstances of the past days and weeks, not always known or disclosed to the peoples so desperately concerned by them, we have been like a man hastening through a darkened house in search of light; door after door has been opened but always the deeper shadow lay behind it. Now a door has been opened on something that may at least be claimed as twilight. Instead of argument or consultation with one man bent on force as his final answer, four men will meet in conference and in the meantime the drift, or rather the steady march, towards war is stayed. \u00b7 This article was amended on Friday October 17 2008.
