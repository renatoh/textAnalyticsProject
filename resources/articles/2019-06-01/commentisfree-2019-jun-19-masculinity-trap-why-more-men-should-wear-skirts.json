He is also a man who isn\u2019t afraid to wear a skirt. Porter wore a tuxedo dress to this year\u2019s Oscars and rocked a very fabulous, very pink, uterus-inspired suit-gown to the Tony awards. Not everyone can pull off an upcycled velvet curtain, but it is a shame more dudes don\u2019t try. As Porter told Stephen Colbert during an appearance on The Late Show, men\u2019s clothing norms are mired in misogyny. \u201cWomen wearing pants is powerful,\u201d the 49-year-old said. \u201cIt\u2019s strong, everybody accepts it and it\u2019s associated with the patriarchy.\u201d However, \u201cthe minute a man puts on a dress, it\u2019s disgusting, so what are you saying? Men are strong, women are disgusting? I\u2019m not doing that any more \u2026 If I feel like wearing a dress, I\u2019m gonna wear one!\u201d It is sad that so many men are petrified about seeming effeminate. It is sad that it is not socially acceptable for men to experiment with fashion in the same way women can. Happily, however, things are changing gradually. No one looks twice at a guy with a man-bun or a man-bag any more; male makeup is a growing industry; and male rompers were a thing for a while. While men in dresses are still considered noteworthy, guys such as Porter are sashaying into the mainstream. The rapper Young Thug is fond of skirts and the actor Jaden Smith frequently and unapologetically dons dresses. \u201cIf I Wanna Wear A Dress, Then I Will, And That Will Set The New Wave,\u201d Smith wrote on Twitter last year. Meanwhile London fashion week featured so many men breezing along in gender-fluid fashion that GQ proclaimed: \u201c2019 is the year men will start wearing skirts.\u201d I certainly hope so. Masculinity is a straitjacket; it is high time more men broke free. Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
