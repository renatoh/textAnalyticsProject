On 1 March, Chuck D said the group would be \u201cmoving forward without Flavor Flav\u201d, his colourful sideman since the inception of the political hip-hop group in the mid-1980s, adding: \u201cWe thank him for his years of service and wish him well.\u201d He subsequently claimed he had been sued by Flav \u2013 which Flav denied on Twitter \u2013 and that Flav had been suspended from the group since 2016, complaining that he \u201calways chose to party over work\u201d. He also added that Flav \u201cbetter find rehab\u201d, and accused him of being motivated solely by money. The spat seemed to have been triggered by Flav not performing at a Bernie Sanders rally, with Flav stating via lawyers that he had not endorsed \u201cany political candidate in this election cycle\u201d, and that Chuck D was not allowed to use Public Enemy\u2019s image to endorse a candidate: \u201cWhile Chuck is certainly free to express his political view as he sees fit \u2013 his voice alone does not speak for Public Enemy.\u201d Flav himself tweeted: \u201cYou wanna destroy something we\u2019ve built over 35 years over politics? \u2026 I\u2019ve been clean for 10 years &amp; there is no PE w/o Flavor Flav. I\u2019m worried about you Chuck, you can divide people or bring people together, y\u2019all know what side I\u2019m on.\u201d But Chuck D has now described the entire episode as a hoax: \u201cDoes it take doing crazy sht [sic] or catastrophe to wake people up? Obviously so, even when paying attention is the cheapest price to pay,\u201d he wrote on his website. He continued: \u201cI had watched Orson Welles\u2019 War of the Worlds from 1938 when he pulled the wool over the public\u2019s eyes as they put 100% belief in the technology of radio. Most people followed like a Pavlovic dog just like they do now \u2026 Hearing the confused mush of political talk while under the bowels of Trumpotus made me use a presidential stage as my platform. Out of this storm came a plan between Flav and me to remind people that what\u2019s important should have as much, if not more, value than just what\u2019s popular. Thus came the HOAX, our War of the Worlds.\u201d He added: \u201cFlav doesn\u2019t do benefits and stays away from political events \u2013 we been cool and always agreed about that.\u201d He detailed the difference between Public Enemy \u2013 a group featuring him and Flav \u2013 with Enemy Radio, an \u201cauxiliary unit\u201d that features all the members except Flav, and which performed at the Bernie Sanders rally, in Los Angeles on 1 March. Flavor Flav later commented on Twitter: \u201cI am not a part of your hoax \u2026 there are more serious things in the world right now than April Fool\u2019s jokes and dropping records, the world needs better than this, you say we are leaders so act like one.\u201d The announcement came alongside a new single, billed as Enemy Radio featuring Public Enemy, that reunites Chuck D and Flavor Flav on a track. Food Is a Machine Gun castigates the US food industry, inspired by Kristin Lawless\u2019s book Formerly Known As Food. The lyrics attack the US Food and Drug Administration, sugar intake, and the use of pesticides and chemicals in food production. An Enemy Radio album, Loud Is Not Enough, was also announced. In a 70-minute interview with Tim Einenkel, Chuck D elaborated further about the situation. He said he wanted to \u201chelp bring [Flav\u2019s] stock up\u201d, as negative stories were dominating over positive ones: \u201cI didn\u2019t like that he was getting hammered in the media.\u201d He admitted there had been a cease and desist letter from Flav\u2019s lawyers, after the Sanders concert was billed as Public Enemy Radio rather than Enemy Radio. \u201cI know that hit a sore spot [with Flav] ... and then came the cease and desist letter, and I counteracted ... The bottom line was a plan to turn this into a teachable moment.\u201d He argued that only negative news stories get traction \u2013 \u201cThe news you read about hip-hop is about another dead rapper\u201d \u2013 and that this was proved by the news of him firing Flav, that \u201cactually proves the fact the gadgets are ruling the game\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
