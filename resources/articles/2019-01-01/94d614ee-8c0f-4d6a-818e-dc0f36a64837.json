It comes three months after the brutal killing of the Saudi dissident and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi \u2013 which US senators have blamed on the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman \u2013 and as the war in Yemen continues to devastate the country. The American comedian Hasan Minhaj was critical of the Saudi heir in an episode of the standup show Patriot Act, delivering a wide-ranging monologue mocking the Saudis\u2019 evolving account of what happened inside the country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul in October, when the journalist was killed. \u201cThe Saudis were struggling to explain his disappearance: they said he left the consulate safely, then they used a body double to make it seem like he was alive,\u201d Minhaj, an American-born Muslim of Indian descent, said. \u201cAt one point they were saying he died in a fist fight, Jackie Chan-style. They went through so many explanations. The only one they didn\u2019t say was that Khashoggi died in a free solo rock-climbing accident.\u201d He went on to specifically criticise Prince Mohammed, \u201cexamining the connection\u201d between the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen and the starvation and destruction that has unfolded in the Gulf state since 2015. Saudi Arabia has been condemned within the UN for the widespread bombing of civilian areas. Human Rights Watch said artists whose work is broadcast on Netflix should be outraged, adding that Saudi Arabia has no interest in its citizens exercising democratic rights. \u201cEvery artist whose work appears on Netflix should be outraged that the company has agreed to censor a comedy show because the thin-skinned royals in Saudi complained about it,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cNetflix\u2019s claim to support artistic freedom means nothing if it bows to demands of government officials who believe in no freedom for their citizens \u2013 not artistic, not political, not comedic.\u201d Minhaj, 33, became the senior correspondent on Comedy Central\u2019s The Daily Show in 2014 and appeared as the coveted featured speaker at the White House correspondents\u2019 dinner in 2017. Netflix defended its decision, stressing that it was in response to a \u201cvalid legal request\u201d from the kingdom\u2019s communications and information technology commission, to which it acceded in order to \u201ccomply with local law\u201d. \u201cWe strongly support artistic freedom worldwide and only removed this episode in Saudi Arabia after we had received a valid legal request \u2013 and to comply with local law,\u201d the company told the Financial Times. It added that the Saudi telecoms regulator cited a cyber-crime law that states that \u201cproduction, preparation, transmission, or storage of material impinging on public order, religious values, public morals, and privacy, through the information network or computers\u201d is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine not exceeding SR3m ($800,000). The episode can still be seen in other parts of the world \u2013 and in Saudi Arabia on YouTube \u2013 yet it is likely to raise pressing new questions about the limits of free online expression and the responsibility of western companies to uphold liberal values. Karen Attiah, Khashoggi\u2019s editor at the Washington Post, said that it was outrageous that Netflix had caved to pressure from Saudi Arabia. \u201cHasan Minhaj of Patriot Act has been a strong, honest and (funny) voice challenging Saudi Arabia + Mohammed bin Salman in the wake of #khashoggi\u2019s murder,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cHe brought awareness about Yemen. Quite outrageous that Netflix has pulled one of his episodes critical of Saudi Arabia. \u201cWhen Jamal Khashoggi wrote about the need for free expression in the Arab world (and everywhere), that freedom is not just about journalists. It\u2019s about freedom for artists, comedians, cartoonists, musicians, activists and anyone who wants to express their views on society.\u201d The NGO Reporters Without Borders in October ranked Saudi Arabia 169th out of 180 countries for press freedom, adding that \u201cit will very probably fall even lower in the 2019 index because of the gravity of the violence and abuses of all kinds against journalists\u201d. The Saudi information ministry and Netflix did not respond to requests for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
