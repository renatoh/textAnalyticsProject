One in four of the 115,000 licensed premises in Britain still had not reopened by the end of August after restrictions were imposed to contain Covid-19, according to data from the analysis firm CGA and AlixPartners. With concern growing about rising infection rates, a ban on gatherings of more than six people comes into effect across England on Monday, while Scotland and Wales have their own amended restrictions. The measures, coupled with local lockdowns, have stoked fears that a fledgling recovery among businesses that have managed to trade will be nipped in the bud, particularly if rumours of a 10pm curfew in England \u2013 or even 9pm in Scotland \u2013 prove to be true. Richard Nattriss, who runs the Little Angel in Whitby, North Yorkshire, said a brief recent period of strong trading would grind to a halt in the event of a local lockdown, with government grants for affected businesses insufficient to pay staff. \u201cMiddlesbrough\u2019s our worry because it\u2019s had a large increase and lots of people come down from there for a drink,\u201d Nattriss said. \u201cIf they bring it [coronavirus] to Whitby, nobody knows how much of a flare-up it\u2019s got to be before we all get shut down. \u201cIf that\u2019s after October [when the furlough scheme ends] they\u2019re prepared to give us \u00a31,500 every three weeks but that\u2019s not gonna pay anybody\u2019s wages. \u201cThat\u2019s when you\u2019d end up seeing redundancies and staff being laid off very quickly.\u201d Liz Hind, the landlady of the Old Millwrights Arms in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, said she was already feeling the pinch, with the the uplift from the eat out to help out scheme wearing off. \u201cNew rules come in on Monday and I\u2019ve had parties who\u2019ve cancelled because they can\u2019t have any more than six people inside or outside,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know we need to do our bit and we may need to close again for the good of public health but we shouldn\u2019t be abandoned if there is that requirement. \u201cI live above the pub, so if I lose it I lose my home because it\u2019s a commercial premises, so I\u2019m not even covered by the laws on evictions. It\u2019s bleak.\u201d Hind, a former Labour parliamentary candidate, called on the government to heed the opposition party\u2019s call to extend the furlough scheme to support pubs and bars. Paul Crossman, who runs three pubs in York, backed the proposal. \u201cPeople are at the limit of their reserves, so any more lockdowns now would be the nail in the coffin of the operators of those small pubs,\u201d he said. The British Beer and Pub Association called for a sector-specific furlough scheme beyond October as well as extended VAT cuts, business rate relief and a cut to beer duty, which the chief executive, Emma McClarkin, said \u201cremains punitively high\u201d. Nightclubs have previously warned they face \u201cfinancial armageddon\u201d after being excluded from the relaxation of restrictions that allowed many pubs to open in July. Michael Kill, the chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said: \u201cWith no roadmap for reopening or further indication of financial support, it\u2019s causing quite a considerable level of distress and anger.\u201d He pointed to a looming crunch point at the end of September, when state-funded furlough payments are reduced and a moratorium on forfeiture of commercial premises for non-payment of rent comes to an end. \u201cPeople will have to make some quite drastic decisions,\u201d Kill said. \u201cAt some point there has to be a realisation that there are going to be businesses and jobs lost.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
