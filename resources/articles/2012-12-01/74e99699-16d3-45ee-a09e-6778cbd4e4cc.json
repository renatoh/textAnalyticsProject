Some experts say that final turn of the final cog on the Mesoamerican long calendar doesn't spell the end of the world, arguing that Mayans would not have feared but instead celebrated their celestial mileometer looping the loop. But don't rely on that. The cluster of magical dates \u2013 12/12/12 last week, 20/12/2012 this week \u2013 surely points to a tryst with destiny. There is no data on past Armageddons to draw on, so no empirical basis for rejecting the notion that on 21/12/12 the referee in the sky will glance at his watch and blow the whistle. Besides, there is advantage in assuming the worst. Religions rely on apocalypse to drum up urgency among their ranks \u2013 just think of the fire and brimstone in Revelation. But for the faithless, too, there's no better philosophy than living every day like it's your last."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
