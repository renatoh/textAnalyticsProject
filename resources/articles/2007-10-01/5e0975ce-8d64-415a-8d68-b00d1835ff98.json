Sri Lanka's cricketing fraternity has been struck with the fear that Ryan Sidebottom has become Malinga's hair apparent. Sidebottom is on his first tour but he outbowled Malinga, Sri Lanka's most flamboyant paceman, in the second one-day international in Dambulla on Thursday. In an unshakeable display he rivalled Malinga by touching speeds of 90mph, made good use of slower balls and snarled so much that he might have bitten his own hair and shaken it like a dog with a slipper. Sidebottom set the tone for England's 65-run win by removing both Sri Lanka openers; Malinga had earlier conceded 58 runs without taking a wicket. Malinga, according to his hairdresser, can spend two days having his highlights perfected, but it was Sidebottom, perspiring heavily through an unruly mop of ginger curls, who claimed the cricketing highlights. Now, you might protest that this matters not a jot. To Sri Lanka, it does. Malinga's grandiose hairstyle led him to being voted the World Cup's sexiest cricketer in the West Indies this year, and that was regarded as a wonderful lark as it irritated the Australians, who were confident of winning everything. Malinga's hair became an issue, vexing some readers of the state-controlled Colombo Daily News. \"He is a good cricketer, but not a decent-looking gentleman,\" complained one letter-writer. His presentation tarnished the respectable outlook of the rest of the team. Malinga should uphold the traditions of a \"country boy coming from a good cultural background\". In Dambulla, Malinga's hair resembled a dandelion head in full seed, its spores about to be blown away on the breeze. If he could make a wish for tomorrow's third game of five it would be that the unkempt Yorkshireman will stop upstaging him. Sidebottom professes no interest in the battle for the biggest hair in cricket. He has long hair because he always has had. He had it cut shortly before leaving for Sri Lanka, because of the heat, but it is unlikely he was in the barber's chair for longer than 10 minutes. If they remark in Colombo high society that Malinga knows his roots, it will be taken to mean that he knows foil highlights require precision application. When they say Sidebottom knows his roots in Yorkshire - or, indeed, in Nottinghamshire, the county that brought him to fulfilment - it suggests that no matter how many wickets he takes for England he will not change one bit. Actually, the same is true of Malinga, whose early cricket was played with coconut husks and rudimentary bats on Hikkaduwa beach on Sri Lanka's west coast and whose breaking of social barriers to become one of the world's most exciting bowlers is so uplifting that, frankly, he can favour any hairstyle he likes. Sidebottom was ignored by Duncan Fletcher and though it is open season on England's former coach, this does seem to be a glaring error. If Sidebottom is to follow up a solid one-day series with success in the three Tests before Christmas, though, he may have to learn a few survival tricks from Sri Lanka's left-armer, Chaminda Vaas. England have never produced a left-arm pace bowler with 100 Test wickets. Bill Voce, another man of Notts, managed 98 and he retired soon after the second world war. Sidebottom took 24 wickets against West Indies and India last summer but he is 29, so he will need to be particularly resilient to take 100. England, tomorrow, will just settle for another good hair day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
