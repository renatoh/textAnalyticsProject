The result is, to put it politely, severe. It seems Neville\u2019s instructions to his French barber got lost in translation. \u201cA disaster,\u201d he declares. \u201cI needed an interpreter. It\u2019s called a 10-day haircut, which means in 10 days it will be better.\u201d By then Neville could yet be polishing his shoes and pressing that hallmark waistcoat for a World Cup final. First, though, his Lionesses must win two games, the first against Norway in Le Havre on Thursday night. It is a quarter-final brimming with subplots. How far will the sickness virus infecting the England camp spread? Might defenders Lucy Bronze and Millie Bright recover in time to play? And how much will Neville\u2019s side miss their captain, Steph Houghton, should she fail to overcome an ankle injury? Throw in a heatwave and a fairly impregnable-looking Norway defence which should be very much at home in a city constructed by the pioneer of reinforced concrete, Auguste Perret, and the BBC really does have a proper prime-time drama. Neville\u2019s revelations that his wife, Julie, has been lighting candles and saying prayers for the team at the family home in Manchester only heightens the human interest. As an anticipated record television audience tunes in, England\u2019s manager trusts months spent road-testing his beloved rotation policy and implementing a new, almost Spanish, playing style will be fully vindicated. \u201cI\u2019m a great believer in looking in my players\u2019 eyes,\u201d says a coach who hopes to at least emulate England\u2019s 2015 achievement of finishing third at the last World Cup in Canada. \u201cThe look in their eyes today is relaxed, happy and like they\u2019re ready to win.\u201d Neville often talks about \u201cliving or dying\u201d by a \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d possession-based philosophy and his impressive serenity perhaps stems from this almost fatalistic attitude. \u201cI lost my job at Manchester United, I lost my job at Valencia \u2013 it happens,\u201d he says. \u201cFootball\u2019s like that. But I don\u2019t go into games thinking about losing, I go in thinking I\u2019m going to have fun and do the best I can. That\u2019s my mentality. My wife\u2019s different, she thinks about \u2018what ifs\u2019. \u201cI prefer to think we\u2019ve played four World Cup games, won four and kept three clean sheets but my wife gets emotional because she knows what it all means to everyone. Every squad member has 15 or 16 people following them around France. They\u2019ve been driving sometimes 15 or 16 hours to games and they\u2019re creating lifelong memories and friendships. It might seem emotional and sentimental but that\u2019s how it feels. I\u2019ve even had a message from my brother Gary. It said \u2018Good luck\u2019 and there was an emoji. From him, that\u2019s love.\u201d In reality Neville is extremely close to his brother as well as his mother, Jill, and twin sister, Tracey, the England netball coach. Such details are a source of fascination to French journalists who have dubbed England\u2019s emotionally intelligent manager \u201cThe Benevolent Leader\u201d and even seem interested in Neville\u2019s revelation that his son, Harvey, has just passed his driving theory test. The Lionesses manager won numerous plaudits for a candid, yet measured, deconstruction of Cameroon\u2019s appalling behaviour as England won 3-0 in Valenciennes last Sunday in a game punctuated by stamping, spitting and threatened sit-down protests. \u201cAfterwards, everyone was in shock,\u201d Neville said. \u201cThen, when we got back to the hotel, Greg Clarke, the FA chairman, made a fantastic speech to the players praising their behaviour in such difficult circumstances. They now know they\u2019re mentally strong \u2013 that\u2019s another barrier overcome.\u201d Clarke and his FA colleagues admire Neville the man and the motivator but his lack of big-game managerial experience dictates no one is sure how good a pure football coach he is. Time will tell but certain signs are encouraging. If England\u2019s frequent inability to sustain his possession game for 90 minutes remains a worry, Ellen White\u2019s progress is indicative of a manager blessed with the welcome knack of improving players. \u201cElle\u2019s taken her game to another level,\u201d says Neville. \u201cPeople thought she was a grafter, a hard worker who did a job for the team. But I\u2019ve not seen a better centre-forward in this tournament. You\u2019re seeing a player at the absolute maximum of her ability and belief. She\u2019s scored three of her four goals with her weaker foot. I dread to think what will happen when she starts kicking with her right. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to teach her to hold back the hard way, to wait for those big moments when the ball drops in the six-yard box. For six months she looked at me as if I had a horn on my head for telling her to stop running. Now she\u2019s a Van Nistelrooy, a Shearer, an Owen, that ultimate predator. All she thinks about now is goals.\u201d Norway are without Ada Hegerberg, their own star forward whose dissatisfaction with the politics of her country\u2019s FA prompted her to shun the national team. \u201cIn terms of system, physicality and technically, they tick every box,\u201d says Neville. \u201cNorway look to have a cause. Maybe Ada Hegerberg not coming has given them that cause, to prove that they can win without her. That siege mentality\u2019s always a good thing.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
