A game marked by Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s 100th Premier League goal for City \u2013 although it should have been disallowed for offside \u2013 featured an unexpected equaliser from Vurnon Anita and the spurning of an inviting late chance by the Newcastle substitute Georginio Wijnaldum. \u201cBefore the game I wanted three points, after conceding the goal I wanted one point but after Gini\u2019s chance I wanted three again,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez, who was delighted with his side\u2019s new-found togetherness and unity, and knows, while their position is not ideal \u2013 two points behind fourth-bottom Norwich and one behind third-bottom Sunderland with four games remaining \u2013 is not exactly hopeless. With Moussa Sissoko, Cheik Tiot\u00e9 and Andros Townsend all impressing, a real synergy was created with the supporters, leaving Ben\u00edtez particularly delighted by the reaction to falling behind. \u201cI didn\u2019t see it but I hear Ag\u00fcero\u2019s goal was offside,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after conceding the reaction from us was so good. The fans were behind every single tackle, the fans were pushing and pushing. There was a great connection between the players and the fans; they could see this team is fighting. The result could be better but it could be worse. City are fighting for the top four and they play a fantastic game. We have to believe. We\u2019ve shown we can fight, we have to believe we can beat anyone.\u201d Although loathe to single out individuals for praise, Ben\u00edtez did afford Tiot\u00e9 a special mention. \u201cI\u2019m really pleased with Cheik, he\u2019s doing a great job,\u201d he said before emphasising another \u201cgreat performance\u201d on the part of the apparently reborn Sissoko, his new captain. While Ben\u00edtez also had kind words for Andros Townsend, Anita and Jack Colback, Manuel Pellegrini was more downbeat. \u201cWe knew before the game it would be very tough,\u201d said City\u2019s manager, whose side are third, five points ahead of fifth-placed Manchester United, who have a game in hand. \u201cWe didn\u2019t play well enough. That was not the same team as Saturday [when City beat Chelsea] but every season the race for the top four is very close.\u201d At least he has Ag\u00fcero. \u201cI\u2019m very happy for him,\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy scoring goals in the Premier League.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
