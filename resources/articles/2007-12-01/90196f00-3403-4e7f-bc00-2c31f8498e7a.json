I have never seen them do it. My fellow fatties can do many things, but the glossy world of pre-ski, apres-ski and ski-ski is barred to us. We cannot squeeze our way in. But I can. I will. I stand in Saas Fee, at the bottom of Switzerland's highest mountain, swathed in so many layers of protective clothing I resemble a small moon. As I stumble about trying to put the skis on I realise that I have landed in the middle of a World Snowboarding Championships training session. \"Oh, don't worry,\" says Florence, my smiling blonde instructor. \"It's just the Slovakian and South Korean national teams. They'll go away.\" I clutch my calves and look at the unnatural plastic paddles glued to my feet. I shriek, \"It hurts! It hurts!\" Florence smiles politely. \"Well done, Tanya,\" she says. \"You have put on your skis.\" She orders me towards the ski lift. The idea of holding on to a piece of wire and being dragged up a mountain is alien to everything I have ever known. An old man sticks a disc between my legs and the lift pulls me up. At the end I jump off and fall over. It isn't my fault. The pavement is made of ice. What sadist designed this? I collapse on to my side - but I can't get up. My arms flail, but I can't get up. My body is simply incapable. In front of me the world champion snowboarder executes a perfect triple somersault and melts into the arms of her ridiculously beautiful lover, in a montage of Aryan athleticism. I whimper with shame. Florence pulls my skis from my feet. It is the only way. And my lesson begins. Apparently, I can't just go straight down the mountain. Florence explains that I would slap into the restaurant that sells fondue and die. No, you go across the slope in zigzags, turning your body, and thus your skis, from side to side. I begin to slide down the mountain, trying to turn. Florence keeps whispering in my ear: \"You're so good, you're so good, this is great.\" I feel like a low-rent porn star in a very niche market. Before I realise it I am at the bottom. I have zero sense of achievement. We go back to the top and repeat the agony. But after four attempts Florence leaves me to try alone. I begin to slide and immediately I am flat on my back, trapped, immobile and howling. So I try to look casual, as if I am having a break, until the South Korean snowboarding team rescue me. The next morning, I have a new instructor. Florence has become Lawrence, which makes me feel I am being taught to ski by the Muppets. We practise how to zigzag and, with a great existential gasp, I push off and suddenly I am moving. I scream: \"Fuck!\" The \"fuck!\" echoes round the valley and all the way up the mountain. And suddenly it is happening. I can ski! I am a fat person and I can ski! And for two days I get better and better. I listen to Barry White on my iPod and ski. The snowboarding teams stop laughing and I glide, like a fat swan over the mountains. And on my final day, I gaze out over Switzerland and I do what comes naturally. I eat my skis. \u00b7 Inghams (020-8780 4433, inghams.co.uk) has seven nights' half-board at the four-star Hotel Allalin in Saas Fee from pounds 679pp, including flights and rail transfers. Inghams' Learn to Ski package includes six-day adult ski and boot hire, five-day ski school for three hours a day, adults pounds 153, children pounds 125. Clothing hire: skitogshire.co.uk. Further information, myswitzerland.com Tennis in Venice Britain is down to one top 100 tennis player since the retirement of Tim Henman, so unless we start borrowing Canadians again, someone has to pick up the slack. And training on municipal tarmac won't cut it. Clay is the important surface these days, so you need to go to the continent to develop your baseline thumping and sliding skills. Jonathan Markson Tennis runs courses at various locations, including the beautiful Ca' del Moro club on the Venice Lido (where a 0-6, 0-6 scoreline is Death in Tennis). Accommodation is at the Hotel Ca' del Borgo, former summer home of the Doge. \u00b7 Jonathan Markson Tennis (020-7603 2422, marksontennis.com) offers seven nights' B&amp;B with 15 hours' coaching for \u00a3720pp, June 1 and Sept 14, excluding flights; three nights, with nine hours' coaching, \u00a3440, June 5, Sept 18. Other locations are available, including grass courts in Oxford for serve-volley Henmaniacs. Horseriding in Cumbria Horseriding should be one of the most enjoyable forms of low-impact tourism, but all too often it ends up with someone reluctantly kicking a recalcitrant animal more interested in hedgerow snacking. According to the instructors at Overwater Equestrian, it's because you haven't built up trust with the horse - and you can learn to do that quickly. Without getting all Horse Whisperer, the \"Innate Method\" is based on how you approach, saddle, sit on and command your mount - which makes sense - and doesn't require kicks or whips (which put many off riding). You ride in the most northerly and uncrowded Lakeland around Overwater, Skiddaw and Uldale and Caldbeck Fells. \u00b7 Overwater Equestrian (01697 371217, horsehire.co.uk) offers a day's teaching and riding, with a packed lunch, and B&amp;B accommodation in a local farmhouse for \u00a3152.50pp a day. Mountain biking in The Borders Tweed and mountain biking actually go together, it turns out. The Tweed Valley, that is, in the shape of two mountain biking centres: Glentress and Inverleithen. What look like pretty, gently rolling hills transform when you're on two wheels. Glentress has different grades of trail, from a \"Skills Loop\", where you can learn the basic techniques of cross-country and downhill MTBing, via challenging routes with wooden sections, jumps and berms, to a freestyle tricks park. Former World Cup competitors Emma Guy and Tracy Brunger run one-day courses in essential skills and getting air, as well as women-only courses and guiding. You can then take your new skills to the tougher trails of Inverleithen. Not before a visit to The Hub cafe, though, where mud-spattered cyclists wolf down well-earned bowls of soup and cakes. \u00b7 The Hub (01721 721736, thehubintheforest.co.uk) lessons cost \u00a380pp a day, plus \u00a318 for bike hire. Stay at the Glentress Hotel (01721 720100, glentress.org.uk), an established MTB base with an award-winning restaurant, B&amp;B \u00a335 a night. Kayaking in Nottingham The National Water Sports Centre at Holme Pierrepont in Nottingham remains the best place to learn canoeing, despite fears over its future and funding. The 700m grade-three rapids - using water diverted from the Trent by gravity rather than electric pumps - are a world-class challenge. You can take two-day courses at each level of British Canoe Union certificate, progressing from the flat Swan Lake pool to the whitewater itself. As well as the old Eskimo roll, as practised in municipal baths across the land, you'll learn how to make your strokes more efficient - essential when you're desperately trying to escape an eddy that wants to dash you onto a rock. \u00b7 National Water Sports Centre (0115 9824707, nationalwatersportsevents.co.uk) courses cost from \u00a3100. Stay at the Lace Market Hotel (0115 852 3232, lacemarkethotel.co.uk), double rooms from \u00a390 a night. Climbing in The Cairngorms Glenmore Lodge, near Aviemore, has been Scotland's centre of excellence for outdoor sports for more than half a century - most British mountain, ski or climbing guides have done some training there. Apart from its heritage, the lodge's biggest plus point is its setting. It is surrounded by both gentle, wooded hills and jagged mountains with sheer cliffs and unstable scree. The ideal place to learn mountaineering and climbing skills. A five-day rock climbing course (June-September) - with only two students per instructor - covers psychological aspects as well as rope skills and technical training in how to move on the rock. You'll even discover that prusiking is something you're allowed to do in public. The accommodation is fairly basic but, when the dramatic Lairig Gru pass is at the top of the road, you won't want to sit in your room admiring designer curtains. \u00b7 Glenmore Lodge's (01479 861256, glenmorelodge.org.uk) five-day course costs \u00a3495pp full board. They will collect you from Aviemore railway station. Swimming in Sicily Swimming is one of those sports that you think you don't need lessons in beyond childhood. But most of us are frankly rubbish swimmers, thrashing about inefficiently or craning our necks to keep our hair dry. Steven Shaw of Art Of Swimming has developed a training method, incorporating Alexander technique, which streamlines the body in the water, teaches you to breathe right and make each stroke count. Shaw runs courses in the UK, but if you think that a pool set in olive groves on the Sicilian coast might be a more pleasant setting than your local baths, try a teaching holiday at the Kempinski Giardino di Constanza spa hotel (April 5-12). Oh, and Shaw is a bald swimmer - he's probably heard the Duncan Goodhew gags before. \u00b7 Art Of Swimming (020-8446 9442, artofswimming.com) Sicily holiday costs around \u00a31,400pp, including flights, transfers, B&amp;B accommodation and five days' coaching. Surfing in South Africa One of the locations in the classic 60s surf movie The Endless Summer, Jeffreys Bay, near Port Elizabeth - or, simply, J-Bay - is South Africa's prime surfing spot. Unusually, however, it plays host to beginners and experts alike. While the latter are trying to catch the incredibly long barrelling right-hand point break known as supertubes, debutantes can find gentler waves breaking on sandbanks close to shore. Stay at Supertubes guest house, B&amp;B or villa. Like the Windsurfers Pension in Turkey, it proves that sports enthusiasts deserve stylish accommodation, too. \u00b7 Zoco Boardriding Adventures (0871 218 0360, zocotravel.com) offers an eight-day Surfing 101 package, or the same with the Girls Only school. \u00a3495pp for seven nights' B&amp;B, eight two-hour lessons, equipment, transfers, two game park tours and two horseriding or sandboarding excursions, excluding flights. Yacht skippering in Devon It's the ultimate escape dream: sell the house, buy a yacht and sail off into the sunset. Well, unless you get a Royal Yacht Association day skipper qualification, you may well run aground before you leave the harbour. It's a course worth taking, even without your own boat, as it improves your crewing and allows you to charter holiday yachts. The Devon coast out of Dartmouth is a great place to learn - tides and wind combine in quirky ways, the shoreline makes for some great views, and you'll sometimes encounter dolphin. \u00b7 Nonstop Sail (01803 833 399, nonstopsail.com) offers a nine-day day skipper course from \u00a3735. (Or you can split it into the theory and practical sections, \u00a3425 each.) Subject to availability, you can have a free berth on the boat during practical courses. Or stay at Browns Hotel in Dartmouth (01803 832572, brownshoteldartmouth.co.uk), doubles from \u00a385 a night. Telemarking in Norway Norwegian cave paintings show Scandinavians skiing 4,000 years BK (Before Klammer), and the method they used is still around today: telemark. Their heels were free from the ski, they went down on one knee to turn and used a single long pole to help steer. The punting pole has gone, but the rest is making a comeback. The free-heel style makes off-piste adventures easier - at least the climbing part - and when it's done well, it is the most elegant style of skiing there is: it looks like the Six Million Dollar Man and Bionic Woman are racing down the hill. Nordic Challenge is running a week's Learn To Telemark holiday in G\u00e5l\u00e5, just north of Lillehammer. It's a good little beginner's resort (which is helpful - the early stages of learning telemark are tough, so you don't want to be tempted to bunk off on Alpine skis) with expert instructors. \u00b7 Nordic Challenge (01969 663388, nordicchallenge.com) has one week from March 9 for \u00a3930, including transfers, full board in the family-run Wadahl H\u00f8gfjellshotell, equipment and 30 hours' instruction costs, excluding flights. Norwegian.no has Stansted-Oslo flights from \u20ac36 each way. Running in Spain If you have signed up to run the London Marathon on April 13, you don't have to be Jade Goody to be reluctant to train in dank, dark Dagenham throughout the winter. You could reward yourself with a warm weather training camp in March. Run In The Sun offers training in the hills behind the resort of Moraira, on the beaches of the Costa Blanca and at the town's modern athletics track. With UK Athletics-qualified coaches and Spanish experts working with you, you are sure to cut your personal best. Sports massages are also available. \u00b7 Run In The Sun (0844 734 4556, runinthesun.com) offers two nights' B&amp;B in a shared villa with coaching for \u00a3115 and \u00a3345 for seven nights. Excludes flights to Valencia or Alicante and transfers. Paragliding in Nepal When Tom Petty said, \"I'm learning to fly . . . but I ain't got wings,\" he was probably on a paragliding course. Of all the airborne sports, paragliding is the closest we can get to flying like a bird. You don't use a plane to gain height, you run off a mountainside (to be green, you walk up, but usually there's a jeep or ski lift to help). You rely on thermals to climb and you have a huge amount of control over where you go. Tandem flights are available everywhere, but you can't experience the majestic solitude of a golden eagle with a stranger pressed into your buttocks and breathing down your neck. Flying Fever offers courses in solo flight from its base on Arran, but for the most dramatic canvas for your work, take their holiday to Pokhara, Nepal, and learn to fly in the foothills of the Himalayas, with a great lake and rice paddies below you. Your teachers are experienced Swiss pilots, so you'll soon ditch kindergarten errors like jumping on take-off (you collapse in a heap). \u00b7 Flying Fever (0177 030 3899, flyingfever.net) seven-day beginner's course in Nepal costs \u00a3750. They can advise on travel to Pokhara and accommodation. Diving in Indonesia The prevailing view of scuba diving is that you have to learn it somewhere dull before going to the exciting waters with the colourful fish. Forget that - go for instant gratification. There is apparently a greater variety of marine life off North Sulawesi than anywhere else in the world. As well as sea snakes, sharks and turtles, there are bizarre creatures such as pegasus sea moths, mimic octopus, ribbon eels and flying gurnards to be seen near the black sandy slopes of an underwater volcano. Eco Divers at the luxurious Tasik Rea resort, Manado, run courses from basic scuba, via PADI Open Water, to underwater photography. \u00b7 Regal Dive (01353 659999, regal-diving.co.uk) has a week's B&amp;B at Tasik Rea from \u00a3999pp, including flights and transfers. PADI courses cost \u00a3225 (open water), \u00a3145 (scuba diver), and a day's diving costs around \u00a350. Powder skiing in British Columbia Even in a bar, you can tell who the good skiers are. They're the ones talking about the really good skiers and what they need to do to emulate them. You never stop learning in skiing - or rather, you should never stop learning. And going to off-piste lessons is like graduating to university. No more learning by rote - you have to feel your way through the subject. Fernie, in British Columbia, is off-piste Ivy League. It has huge areas of undeveloped slopes that you traverse or hike out to, with evocative unofficial names such as Siberia, Currie Bowl and Lost Boy Pass, and so much dry, dry powder, before plunging down into the tree line. The two-day Steep &amp; Deep camp there is run by local instructors/guides who help you hone your technique to get your skiing into an unstoppable rhythm. Fernie is also a great former mining town that has retained a lot of character. \u00b7 Fresh Tracks (020-8410 2022, skifreshtracks.co.uk) has a nine-night trip to Fernie (February 1-10) for \u00a31,195, including room-only accommodation, flights and transfers, the Steep &amp; Deep camp and avalanche transceiver rental. Suitable for experienced off-piste skiers. Snowboarding in France If you snowboard, rather than ski, you no longer automatically gain cred points. With baggy gear-wearing new-school skiers pulling ever bigger tricks on twin-tip skis, the odd two-foot air with a melon grab just doesn't impress any more. Snowboarders need to raise their game. Morzine-based More Mountain is running Snowparking, a freestyle snowboard camp (January 12-19), in association with Avoriaz Alpine Snowboard School. They teach you how to get air and rotation in the halfpipe and park (tip: speed is your friend - don't slow on the approach to the kicker, or you'll just splat on the flat bit you need to clear). And you will be guided off-piste, so you can emulate those snowboard mag backcountry cover-shot jumps. Accommodation is in The Loft, a Savoyard chalet with a light and stylish modern interior - another example of boutique hotel chic for the extreme sports enthusiast (see surfing and windsurfing). \u00b7 More Mountain (0033 686 021805, moremountain.com) has one place left on the Snowparking camp, costing \u00a3599pp, which includes transfers from Geneva (not flights), seven nights' half board, lift pass and five days' tuition. Tailor-made packages can be arranged throughout the season to include freestyle tuition. Kite buggying in Dorset Kitebuggying or parakarting is a field- or beach-based version of kitesurfing. The sport requires a combination of kite-flying skills and an understanding of sailing principles. If you get everything right, you can reach speeds of up to 70mph, and even give the kitesurfers a run for their money by getting air. Paracademy runs weekend courses on grassland at Portland, Dorset, starting by teaching kite flying on two feet before progressing to straight-line buggying and gradually working up to turns. \u00b7 Paracademy's (01305 824797, paracademy.co.uk) two-day course costs \u00a3190,pp including equipment hire. Stay at Turnstones (0845 325 8801, turnstones.net), doubles \u00a365. Golf Co in Kerry If you're going to work on your swing, the best place to do it right now must be Ireland. First, the local pros are brimming with expertise and confidence after Padraig Harrington became the first European in almost a decade to win the Open Championship last summer. Second, you can drive down the fairway with less guilt than on a strip of artificially green grass in a desert. Ballybunion's two links courses, dating back to 1893, are overwhelmingly naturally formed; they employ an agronomist to protect the land; and only sell biodegradable wooden tees in the club shop. The club pros can organise a teaching package for you if you book in advance. \u00b7 Lessons cost \u20ac50, less if block-booked, ballybuniongolfclub.ie. Stay at Iragh ti Connor, a 17-bedroom country home/hotel, \u20ac95pp/pn B&amp;B, golfballybunion.com. Enjoy Guinness and oysters at Harty Costello's seafood restaurant in Ballybunion. RyanAir, easyJet, BA and Aer Lingus fly to Shannon, nearby. Windsurfing in Turkey Alacati, near Izmir in Turkey, has a large, shallow bay with flat water and consistent wind - ideal conditions. The local windsurf school is a Club Mistral, an international franchise with a good reputation for instruction and equipment. Planet Windsurf offers holidays based at the Windsurfers Pension, a stylish seven-room guesthouse above the bay with a pool and a bar showing surf videos. \u00b7 Planet Windsurf (0870 749 1959, planetwindsurf.co.uk) has seven nights' room-only accommodation from \u00a3380pp, including flights and transfers. A six-hour starter course costs \u00a389, including equipment, a full five-day course \u00a3320. Ice climbing in Switzerland If you've only climbed on indoor walls, or even on rock faces, ice climbing is a must-try. For a start, the sheer beauty of the Alps' frozen waterfalls makes simply standing at the bottom worth the trip. But to dig in your ice axe and crampons and work your way to the top is even more satisfying - especially as the ice wall you're travelling up is rarely consistent and always changing. The International School Of Mountaineering runs several ice-climbing courses throughout the winter, including a Classic Alpine Icefalls trip, where you can hone your ability on the gentle ice of the Lauenen glacier, near Leysin, before taking on ice in great Swiss locations such as Kandersteg and Arolla, and through the St Bernard tunnel in Cogne, Italy (some climbing experience required). \u00b7 The International School of Mountaineering (01766 890441, alpin-ism.com) offers a week's ice climbing for \u00a31,265pp, including half board in the Grand Chalet, Leysin, picnic lunch, guiding, equipment and transport to climbing sites. Fly to Geneva and take the train to Leysin (changing to the cog railway at Aigle), \u00a338pp return. Kitesurfing in Tarifa, by Sam Wollaston It's possible that Tarifa, on the southern most tip of Spain, is not the best place in the world to learn how to kitesurf. It's certainly one of the best places to do it, but that's the problem. Everyone knows that. So everyone who can do it is already there, doing it very well. Except for me. I'm in their way. Google is to blame. The first time I saw kitesurfing, I knew it was for me. It just looked so beautiful, skimming along the surface of the water, leaping into the air, riding down waves, and all the power coming from the wind, via a huge colourful kite. I also knew I wanted to improve my Spanish (it couldn't be much worse). So I put \"kitesurfing + Spanish language\" into Google and found myself enrolling on a two-week Spanish and kitesurfing course at the Escuela Hispalense, in Tarifa. In the mornings I went to class; in the afternoons, down to the beach. My Spanish improved dramatically, to the point where I could understand what other kitesurfers were shouting at me. You rude people! Maybe my kite is all tangled up with yours, but there's no need for such language. And anyway, my mother is not a prostitute, she's a B&amp;B lady. It's a frustrating business, learning to kitesurf - far more so than, say, skiing or snowboarding, where you can be up and running in a day. First you have to master the kite, learning how to launch it and control it with the bar attached to your harness. Then you do something called \"body dragging\", which involves being pulled through the waves without a board - in my case, without any idea where I was going either (Morocco, by the look of things). The experts - beautiful young people riding waves, showing off to the other beautiful young people on the beach - don't take kindly to novice body draggers dragging their bodies across their paths. There is a solution to the Tarifa congestion problem: go before June 15 or after September 15. Between those dates, much of the beach is closed to kitesurfers, so in the areas that are open it's mayhem. Outside peak summer, though, you can walk down the beach to escape from the rude posers and get tangled up with yourself in peace. And it's a fabulous place for doing it - consistently strong winds and dozens of schools. Anyway, after body dragging, you have to basically start all over again with a board. And at first it seems impossible, but slowly it begins to happen. You come out of the water a little bit, before wiping out. Then a bit more . . . And then, it just happens, like riding a bike. It was around day six. Suddenly I was skimming across the surface, pulled by a huge, orange kite. It was only a few seconds, but I was hooked. The runs got longer. There was nothing you could really call steering yet, and certainly no jumps - not intentionally, anyway. But at the end of two weeks, I was kitesurfing. Kinda. Enough to resent the beginners floundering about in the shallows. Out of my way, hijo de puta! \u00b7 Escuela Hispalense (0034 956 680927, hispalense.com) has a two-week course with four hours' Spanish every weekday morning, and a total 12 hours' kitesurfing for \u20ac758pp in high season (July and August) and \u20ac669pp in low season. The school can provide apartment accommodation from \u20ac120pp a week for a single room.
