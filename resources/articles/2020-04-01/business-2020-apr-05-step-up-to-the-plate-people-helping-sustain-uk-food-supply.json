Though supermarkets have introduced rationing and panic buying appears to be on the wane, there is lingering uncertainty about what to expect in the weeks and months ahead. Some food producers and suppliers have acted quickly and creatively to try to ensure fresh food remains available across the UK. Here are some of the people and grassroots initiatives trying to make a difference. The community group Planna Fwyd \u2013 Welsh for plant food \u2013 is a community project in the Dyfi Valley in mid Wales. The project organises a variety of food production initiatives, from Zoom lessons for first-time crop growers to sending out seed packets for families to grow in their gardens, and has about 100 local people involved. The group also plans to organise a second world war-style \u201cland army\u201d of volunteers to work on farms, with about 30 people signed up and plenty more showing interest, out of a town of 2,000 people. The project was born three weeks ago, after Mach Maethlon, a community organisation working to improve food supply and sustainability in the local area, joined up with the local coronavirus aid group in an attempt to combat fears around a food shortfall. \u201cAfter the crisis kicked off, we got lots of people saying they were worried about food supply, and asking if they could help,\u201d said Katie Hastings, one of the group\u2019s coordinators. \u201cWe had a range of people, from families wanting to turn their land to veg, to farmers wanting to grow food on empty land.\u201d The group are having to reckon with social distancing regulations, ensuring that volunteers can work collectively and share toolswithout putting each other at risk. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to work to improve the food supply here for eight years, and have had a sudden burst of enthusiasm. We import a lot of vegetables here, and while the project came in response to fear over food supplies, it will hopefully have a positive ongoing impact after the crisis,\u201d Hastings said. The group also hopes to help those in isolation. \u201cThere are a lot of people at home struggling with not working and being isolated. If we can work out a safe way to work on farms, it gives them the chance to do something meaningful,\u201d Hastings said. The baker Reeve the Baker was established in 1952 in Barford St Martin, a village six miles west of Salisbury in Wiltshire. These days the company has 200 staff and 12 shops dotted around Wiltshire, Dorset and Hampshire. One hour after Boris Johnson announced the UK lockdown, its owner, Gary Reeve, grandson of the bakery\u2019s founder, Harold Reeve, closed all the shops and furloughed most of the staff. \u201cIt was the hardest decision of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI could have stayed open, we\u2019re a food business, but we have small shops and enforcing social distancing would have been a nightmare. My staff were worried too.\u201d People rely on the bakeries and he did not want to let the community down so came up with a plan to deliver bread instead. Five bakers work overnight and bag up rolls and bread that is then taken by one driver to 20 surrounding villages. Each village has a designated weekly delivery day. Reeve relies on local businesses that have been temporarily forced to close, such as the Wyndham Arms pub in Dinton, to organise orders. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be done without the village coordinators,\u201d he said. \u201cThe landlady, Mary Gibbens, takes customer orders and card payments over the phone and we drop off once a week and people in the village collect from her. She knows everyone and makes sure all the elderly and vulnerable get their supplies. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone back to how it was when my grandfather was baking bread. He would deliver to villages too. The community spirit we\u2019ve encountered has been amazing.\u201d In addition to the deliveries there is a pop-up shop in the town of Wilton twice a week. The truck driver Jacques van Doornewaard is a lorry driver bringing fruit and vegetables from the Netherlands to the UK. He travels about three times a week bringing goods including pears, strawberries and mushrooms to British supermarkets. According to Van Doornewaard, Britain\u2019s shelves would run out of fresh produce within a couple of days without supplies from countries including the Netherlands. \u201cIf the supply chain of food was disrupted for 24 or 48 hours, all shops would be empty,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout truck drivers everything would come to a standstill. \u201cIt\u2019s much quieter than usual. The ferry\u2019s capacity is 280 lorries, and on a quiet day there are about 105. Yesterday, on the ferry there were less than 50 drivers. We have to eat in shifts to maintain social distancing.\u201d Van Doornewaard used to deliver to food markets, who would sell the produce to restaurants, but this supply chain has closed down in recent weeks. Instead, more produce is going to supermarkets, as staff scramble to fill the shelves. In the past week, Van Doornewaard has delivered 3,000kg of pears to Tesco in Dagenham, east London, and half as many to Sainsbury\u2019s, also in Dagenham, with stops at farms across southern England. He has also delivered mushrooms, strawberries and cheese. Through the week, he returns to collect thousands of empty trays to take back to be refilled in the Netherlands. The UK lockdown is more severe than in the Netherlands, and he has been struck by the emptiness of British streets. \u201cThe children\u2019s playgrounds are empty. Some minor roadworks are going on, [but] the big construction sites are empty. It\u2019s funny to notice since in the Netherlands that kind of work is still going on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like on a Sunday morning, except for the fact that you see almost more lorries than cars.\u201d The local farmers\u2019 initiative As restaurants close their doors, many farmers are struggling to sell their produce to their usual suppliers, while more people are eating at home and struggling to get food from supermarkets. In response to this, Cathy St Germans established Farms to Feed Us, a digital database that connects people with farmers, enabling them to buy fresh food directly. So far, more than 80 farmers, growers and suppliers across the country have signed up. \u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of fresh produce on our farms and being fished in our seas,\u201d she said. \u201cThere has never been a more important time to eat healthy food and support your local farmers, growers and fishermen.\u201d She added: \u201cWe really focus on small-scale farmers and growers, where the ground isn\u2019t having its life sprayed out of it. It\u2019s not just about being organic, the size and ethos of the farms matter.\u201d The group is working with sustainable agriculture organisations including the Biodynamic Association and Pasture for Life to record and share the growers on a database, which can be searched according to area, or product, and can be easily printed for those who are less computer-literate. \u201cI was taken aback by the response, there are so many people reaching out and wanting to know when it was available,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was really amazing and really moving \u2013 there were so many people wanting to help, from all walks of life and all over the country.\u201d If you have a project or initiative in response to Covid-19 that that you\u2019d like us to know about, please share it here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
