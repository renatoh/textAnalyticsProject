Two jets bombed what were described as military targets in Bouake soon after dawn and government commanders said armoured units would head north to defeat the insurgents and reunify the west African country. There are 10,000 French and UN peacekeeping troops in the country, but it was not clear last night whether they intended to intervene. Smoke rose over Bouake after the air raids which the rebels' leader, Guillaume Soro, said seriously wounded dozens of civilians. His fighters spread across the city reinforcing checkpoints while most civilians stayed indoors. Colonel Phillipe Mangou, a government military chief, told the Associated Press his forces would reunify the country, the world's biggest cocoa producer. From the capital Yamoussoukro, 60 miles south of Bouake, Captain Jean-Noel Abbey, who commanded a unit of armoured vehicles, told Reuters his forces would attack all rebel-held areas. \"We think we can finish the war in six days,\" he said. Insurgents have held the north since a failed coup in September 2002 triggered a brief civil war."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
