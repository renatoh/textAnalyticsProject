The country\u2019s culture minister, Alejandra Frausto, has written to the Venezuelan fashion designer Carolina Herrera to demand an explanation for her company\u2019s use of indigenous Mexican designs in its latest collection. The label says its new Resort 2020 line \u201ctakes on the playful and colourful mood of a Latin holiday\u201d and is about \u201cvisceral reactions of delight-eclectic patterns, unexpected silhouettes, pulsating energy\u201d. It has certainly prompted an unexpected and energetic response from the Mexican government, which has asked the brand to explain why it is using designs \u201cwhose origins are well documented\u201d. In a letter sent to Herrera and the company\u2019s creative director, Wes Gordon, Frausto said: \u201cThis is a matter of ethical consideration that obliges us to speak out and bring an urgent issue to the UN\u2019s sustainable development agenda: promoting inclusion and making those who are invisible visible.\u201d The letter, seen by the Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds, singled out certain designs. It claimed that one long white dress embroidered with bright animals, colours and flowers was derived from the culture of the Tenango de Doria community in Hidalgo state \u201cwhere each piece of embroidery tells the story of the community and each element has a personal, family or community meaning\u201d. Two other dresses, it added, incorporated elements from the famous traditional shawls of Saltillo in Coahuila state. In a statement, Carolina Herrera said the collection had been conceived as a \u201ctribute to the richness of Mexican culture\u201d and its craft techniques. \u201cThere\u2019s an undeniable Mexican presence in this collection,\u201d said Gordon. \u201cIt\u2019s something that jumps out at you and I always intended it to be something latent as a way of showing my love for this country and for all the incredible work I\u2019ve seen there.\u201d The designer added: \u201cMy admiration for the artisanal work has only grown as I have travelled to Mexico over the years. With this new collection, I have tried to highlight the importance of this magnificent cultural heritage.\u201d Last month, the Mexican government said a law would be brought before the senate to \u201ctackle the plagiarism that different indigenous peoples and communities have suffered\u201d by recognising them as the lawful owners of their cultural and identity elements."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
