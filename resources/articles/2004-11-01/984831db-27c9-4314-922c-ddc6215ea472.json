Charles Dutoit's latest concert with the Philharmonia placed the two composers side by side, juxtaposing Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto with Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique. Both are inherently revolutionary - Beethoven's decision to allow the soloist to open the Concerto unaccompanied was as daring in its day as Berlioz's reworking of symphonic structure in terms of semi-confessional narrative - and both performances were conceived in terms of high Romantic gestures and magisterial grandeur. Some might consider Dutoit's interpretations old-fashioned. We've become used to nuance rather than weight in Beethoven's concertos. Here, however, Dutoit chose Yefim Bronfman as his soloist, a pianist whose approach inclines towards the epic and monumental. The performance consequently played itself out on the broadest of scales - the opening piano phrases bristling, the slow movement full of intense conflict and the finale invigorating in its elation. This was thrilling stuff, though one's response to Dutoit's performance of the Fantastique was perhaps more equivocal. Other recent interpretations have unearthed deeper layers of obsession and neurotic debasement in Berlioz's portrait of his druggy alter ego. Dutoit presented a series of Romantic dreams that gradually turned sour. But the lack of visceral power was made up for with some carefully considered insights. The thudding chords that introduce the id\u00e9e fixe were horrid premonitions of the guillotine crash. The first movement mirrored heaving emotions with swaying tempi and the tremolos that open the Ball scene were feverish with anticipation. The playing was exemplary, though the plush orchestral sound led to some blurring of details."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
