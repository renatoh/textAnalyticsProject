For the majority of non-dangerous offenders, community sentences are more likely to prevent further offending. They help to make a person take responsibility for their offending, as well as put something back into the area in which they live. Community sentences can cut crime by 14% and, in 2004, had a success rate of 61%. Of the 128,077 people who started a community sentence in 2004, 77,621 successfully completed their sentence. In comparison, most prisoners are reconvicted within two years of leaving prison. It is because we want to see fewer victims of crime that the Howard League has launched its \"community sentences cut crime\" campaign, including a national award to promote successful community programmes for offenders. Catryn Yousefi Howard League for Penal Reform Lord Phillips is right to add his voice to the many over recent years that have criticised the prison system. The government steams on in its determination to make criminals pay in an old-fashioned way, and the number of prisoners rise inexorably. What is also characteristic is its refusal either to consider more long-term solutions or to examine the problem closely at its roots - in other words, how current policies impact within the prisons themselves. When offered an opportunity by Rideout (Creative Arts for Rehabilitation) to participate in an evaluation of the way prison design impacts upon prisoners and staff, the Home Office turned away. As a forthcoming symposium nears to present the findings of this research, the sound of silence is unmistakable. It might be that the government is too distracted by the penal chaos that envelopes it, were this disinterest not so characteristic of its unwillingness to listen. Chris Johnston Tamworth, Staffs Lord Phillips' recognition of the need for better drug rehabilitation facilities in the community is welcome. Turning Point works with more than 80,000 drug misusing clients, both within the criminal justice system and in the community, and we are aware that in some parts of the country people feel that committing a crime is the only way to get access to the treatment they so desperately need. As a social care organisation, we also provide mental health services and recognise the urgent need for better facilities in the community for prisoners with mental health problems. Care in the community only breaks down if there are not enough services in the community to provide that care. Better rehabilitation and treatment facilities are needed now to help create safer communities and turn lives around.
