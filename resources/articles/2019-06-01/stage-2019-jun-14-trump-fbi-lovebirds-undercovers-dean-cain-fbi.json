On Thursday night, audience members passed through airport-style metal detectors into the cavernous and maze-like Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center. At least two wore red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats; one sported a blue \u201cpro-life\u201d sweater. Outside the amphitheater was a placard for the one-night only show FBI Lovebirds: Undercovers, accompanied by a quotation from the Politico website, \u201cHamilton for the MAGA crowd\u201d, a reference to Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s hit musical, a distinctly un-Trumpian celebration of immigration and racial diversity. What followed inside, over nearly two hours, was a staged reading of text messages between FBI agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, interspersed with chunks of their congressional testimony. Strzok, \u201cregarded as the No 1 counter-intelligence agent in the world\u201d, was among the leaders of the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. But he was axed when it emerged he had been trading indiscreet, Donald Trump-bashing tests with Page, with whom he was having an extramarital affair. Page has also left the FBI. The inspector general\u2019s office found no evidence the attitudes they expressed affected their investigatory work. Even so, they provided fodder for Trump and his constellation of media allies to claim the president was the victim of a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d and say it was high time to investigate the investigators. FBI Lovebirds: Undercovers had been slated for Washington\u2019s Studio Theatre, which typically has a rather different political sensibility, but the performance was cancelled for security reasons. In a statement, aside from mentioning \u201copen and violent threats made against the theater\u201d they also added: \u201cMedia reports have made us aware of undisclosed details about the event.\u201d As a result, it was shifted to the Reagan building on Pennsylvania Avenue, close to the White House, the Trump Hotel and the US Capitol. Strzok was played by Dean Cain, who has declared himself a \u201cTrump guy\u201d and sometimes turns up as a talking head on conservative Fox News; his Twitter feed is littered with retweets of rightwing conspiracy theorists and the National Rifle Association. In the four-page programme, Cain, who starred as Clark Kent in Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, was described as \u201cathletic and intelligent\u201d. Strzok was potrayed here as preening, self-satisfied and smug. Cain was perfectly cast. Page, who has brown hair, was played by Kristy Swanson with blonde hair and a knee-length skirt. Swanson played the original Buffy Summers in the 1992 film Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and also had a role in Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off. This week she retweeted a post by Mike Cernovich, who has promoted baseless claims that Hillary Clinton was part of a child sexual abuse ring in the basement of a pizzeria. Directed by Richard Kuhlman, both actors delivered perfectly respectable performances despite a lack of stage experience. Indeed, despite everything, the night was not devoid of artistic merit. The text messages made for compelling, excruciating and, on occasion, amusing verbatim theatre. Page sighs at one point: \u201cOh, this is painful. Annual ethics training.\u201d She describes Trump as an \u201cenormous douche\u201d and declares: \u201cThe man has no dignity or class. He simply cannot be president.\u201d Most infamously, Page asks Strzok for reassurance that Trump is \u201cnot ever going to become president, right? Right?!\u201d Strzok replies: \u201cNo. No, he won\u2019t. We\u2019ll stop it.\u201d He squirms in his chair as he tries to explain that to Congress. The play shifts back and forth in time to include scenes where the pair are cross-examined by two congressman, composite characters drawn from real hearings on Capitol Hill. Page is reminded that she wrote: \u201cGod, Trump is a loathsome human.\u201d A Congressman asks: \u201cWhat did you mean by that?\u201d Page replies: \u201cI don\u2019t recall.\u201d Playwright Phelim McAleer rightly highlights an offhand comment by Strzok: \u201cJust went to a southern Virginia Walmart. I could smell the Trump support.\u201d A congressman presses, \u201cWhat did it smell like?\u201d and demands, \u201cCould you also smell the Clinton support?\u201d Strzok admits: \u201cI have never tried.\u201d The exchange was likely to confirm many in this audience\u2019s suspicions of how liberal America views them (\u201cdeplorables\u201d). There was a standing ovation and shouts of \u201cBravo!\u201d at the end. The mainly white gathering of nearly 500 will have gone home with their prejudices unchallenged, their faith in Trump strengthened. Audience member Brian Green, 66, an aerospace consultant from the Shenandoah Valley, said: \u201cA large part of the media have ignored this side of the investigation, who took part, what were their biases. It seems pretty clear there\u2019s a story to be found there.\u201d But as a piece of drama, the problem with FBI Lovebirds: Undercovers is a lack of moral heart or sympathetic character. No one comes out of it well. The implied \u201chero\u201d of the piece is off stage and named Donald Trump. McAleer, 52, wearing a white flannel suit and pink shirt, told the Guardian he finds Trump\u2019s presidency \u201cvery interesting and invigorating\u201d and that working on the play made him question the FBI\u2019s conduct. \u201cI think it led me to definitely believe that there to be more investigation of the malfeasance of FBI officers who have politicised the FBI,\u201d he said. \u201cIf if we had J Edgar Hoover\u2019s texts, they might read like that.\u201d McAleer, who is from Omagh in Northern Ireland and has lived in the US for 10 years, acknowledged he has met resistance to his work. \u201cThe arts tend to be liberal and Democratic, but I think the theatre community is like a Maoist wing of that. There\u2019s nobody more left than the theatre community.\u201d Two and a half years into the Trump administration, theatre has offered some pointed productions of Shakespeare\u2019s Julius Caesar and Richard III, as well as bracing new plays such as Shipwreck by Anne Washburn and Building the Wall by Robert Schenkkan. The theatre is usually a space for progressive values. But the enthusiasm roused on Thursday night suggests an appetite to contest it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
