He is also one of the better-connected trainers in government circles, but is inclined towards \u201cself-help\u201d as the best way forward, as tracks start to count the cost of what seems certain to be an entire year without crowds. \u201cI think you\u2019ve got to look at self-help,\u201d he said. \u201cSaying [to the government] lob some money at it is not the approach, they want something that stabilises our industry and also in time delivers revenue to the Treasury, because the youth of our country are being saddled with a debt the likes of which they\u2019ll never be able to work off. \u201cWe have to reorganise ourselves in every way possible and if this doesn\u2019t focus the minds of everybody in all constituent parts of the racing and breeding industries in this country, nothing will.\u201d Gosden\u2019s view does not seem in complete accord with that of the British Horseracing Authority, which has appealed for \u201cdirect financial support\u201d to get the sport through the winter. Like the BHA, however, he accepts the need to adhere to the latest restrictions, while remaining adamant that racecourses can offer a Covid-secure environment. \u201cI feel much more secure going to a racetrack than I do going to the supermarket or petrol station,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should be able to have managed crowds. Look at these huge open spaces, you\u2019re talking hundreds of acres of open air. \u201cWe\u2019re not in an enclosed stadium sitting cheek-by-jowl, and we\u2019re not at the Crucible for a snooker match inside. To that extent it\u2019s very feasible, but legislation is a blunt tool and it\u2019s not able to distinguish between different sporting events. The French have carried on quite happily with their crowds, but it\u2019s going to be inch-by-inch, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Friday\u2019s Newmarket preview It says a good deal about how Kameko\u2019s season has gone since he landed the 2,000 Guineas in June that he returns to the same track and trip for the Group Two Joel Stakes on Friday and is not even sure to start favourite. He has now run well in defeat three times at Group One level without ever looking a likely winner and Benbatl (3.35) is a tough opponent for a horse in need of a confidence boost. Saeed bin Suroor\u2019s evergreen six-year-old produced one of the runs of his life to win this last season after an 11-month break, so a 209-day absence this time around is no great concern. Newmarket 1.50 A big field but perhaps not a huge amount of strength in depth and while Ummalnar is back from 440 days off the track, her win at Ascot in July 2019 was a career-best. William Haggas is more than capable of getting her ready first time and she can extend the frustration for followers of Cloak Of Spirits, second in the 1,000 Guineas but without a win in four starts since. Newmarket 2.25 Alpinista\u2019s five-length second to Love in the Yorkshire Oaks last time is form that leaps off the page, but she set off at 33-1 and did not test the winner at all. Her price looks short enough in the circumstances and the lightly-raced Katara (nap) is a tempting alternative. She has improved dramatically on her last two starts, and the time of her latest win marked her out as Group Three class at least. Newmarket 3.00 Santosha is third-favourite in a field of five for the Rockfel but had second-favourite Isabella Giles nearly two lengths behind her at Ascot in July. A slow start meant her race was over before it started at York but a quicker getaway today would put her in the mix."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
