In fact 'My Family' is exactly the sort of tea-time audience drivel that prompts self-mutilation and talking in tongues in the Fiver household. But as armchair revolutionary Wolfie Smith, we couldn't help but admire the cut of Lindsay's jib; and now, after an absence punctuated only by a brief and unsuccessful experiment by Ecuadorian peasants in 2000, the words \"Power to the People\" are back. After enduring their team's car crash of a Carling Cup match against Watford, Southampton fans have dug out their berets and sheepskin coats and marched upon St Mary's with pitch forks and placards, pulling a giant flaming catapult behind them. Well, sort of. The SaintsAway group have delivered a very nicely written letter demanding that the players who took part in that singular humiliation refund the cost of their 2400 tickets - a sum of \u00a330,000. \"Tuesday night was truly, truly shocking,\" muttered Steve Grant, rocking slowly. \"I know the players said they would swap victory for three league points but they kept to the first part too determinedly.\" Sucking determinedly on a basket of lemons, he added, \"It was a disgrace, they seemed to make a joke of it on their official website but not many fans think it is funny.\" Checking first that ours was not the offending site (as usual), the Fiver pegged it to www.nobarndoortoobigtomiss.com to find out more. \"At 4-0 down to the Championship side,\" they guffawed, \"Dexter Blackstock finally pulled one back - only to let the home side net again within a minute. Some comeback!\" they screamed, going for the funny bone with a cheese grater as 'My Family' scriptwriters applauded from the wings. ********************* BREAKING STORY FROM OUR NEWS WIRES Norwich's on-loan striker David Bentley was dropped by Nigel Worthington after a training prank went wrong, it was revealed today. Bentley, 20, refused to take part in a training exercise, instead booting the ball away as hard as he could in imitation of Peter Kay's John Smith TV commercial. Norwich boss Worthington was not impressed with the joke and Bentley was dropped for the club's last two matches. Today, Worthington said the club considered the matter had been satisfactorily dealt with and Bentley was now back in contention for a first team place. \"We've got good discipline at this club and we've got great pride in it,\" he said. \"It's a little lesson for him to learn and now he's back in the frame for Saturday. He is in contention for a place in the squad.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I've always been involved in performing arts and ... ballet has helped me. I never admitted that as a kid but now I'm bigger and older I can admit something like that\" - Enlightened United defender Rio Ferdinand was offered a place at Ballet School as a kid, and he doesn't care who knows it. * * * * * * * * * * * * MYSTIC MAZZONE FEARS THE WORST Shocking weather, freakish injuries, trumped-up suspensions, lazy players and dodgy referees: all key entries in every manager's book of excuses for failing to win matches. But none of them will suffice for Internazionale, where, with the club making its worst start to Serie A in four years, officials suspect something far more sinister is at work - [cue extravagant dun-dun-dunnn music] a curse! Bologna coach Carlo Mazzone - whose side drew 2-2 with Inter last night - was the latest mystic to hold court on the club's fate: \"Inter have had just about every kind of coach: big ones, little ones, coaches with experience, young coaches, bald guys and guys with hair. Maybe there is some sort of curse on them,\" cackled the 67 year-old, before raising his cloak and disappearing in a puff of smoke. Some Inter staff are clearly swallowing the sorcery line, however. For after the Nerazzuri's draw last night - their ninth of the season - assistant manager Fernando Orsi confided with a shiver: \"Lately we've almost been thinking that's the case. There's something not right here. I thought so when Obafemi Martins hit the post.\" The man who must break the hex or lose his job is former Leicester City great Roberto Mancini. Considered the hottest young thing in Italian management a few months ago, Mancini has come under fire for constantly tinkering (ring any bells, Chelsea fans?). Not that Mancini believes in witchcraft, preferring to offer a bland: \"I came to Inter to try to construct a squad that could become great. To do that will take a bit of time.\" Inter's 11th coach in 10 years to be given time? Now that really would be strange. ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Always a man who knows when he's on to a good thing, Rupert Lowe has started using the words \"Glenn\" and \"Hoddle\" again. Directly after but possibly not connected to Bryan Robson's arrival at the Hawthorns, comes Kanu's transfer request. And Laurent Robert is pouting seductively in PSG's direction. * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Former England midfielder Carlton Palmer has taken temporary charge of Mansfield Town, after the club suspended manager Keith Curle to look into undisclosed allegations. Manchester City midfielder Claudio Reyna has returned to training after a two-month injury lay-off. Happy news at Norwich too, where the club's best player, Darren Huckerby, has signed a one year extension to his contract. Finally, not-at-all-pushy Villa boss David O'Leary has said, again, that he wants to sign a new deal very soon. * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV &amp; RADIO ITV1: London Soccer Night (11.30pm)&gt;BR&gt; \"Can I take up the Kevin Keegan baton and run like the wind,\" pleads Pete Hackleton, beginning another day of your worst pundits.
