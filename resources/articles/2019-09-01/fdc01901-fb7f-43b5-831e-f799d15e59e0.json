Following a ceremonial welcome for Morrison on Friday Washington time attended by more than 4,000 guests, Trump praised Morrison\u2019s personal fortitude, describing him as \u201ca man of real, real strength, and a great guy\u201d. The American president signalled he would raise with Morrison a possible military contribution in Iran beyond the current freedom of navigation commitment in the Strait of Hormuz, but later in the day indicated he had not, in fact, raised the issue during a bilateral meeting at the White House. The Australian prime minister made a point of praising the president\u2019s restraint in relation to Iran to date and made no commitment beyond saying the government would consider any request from the administration on its merits. Asked for his view on China, Trump told reporters \u201cwell, obviously, China is a threat to the world in a sense, because they\u2019re building a military faster than anybody, and, frankly, they\u2019re using US money\u201d. The president indicated he wanted to settle the damaging trade dispute between Washington and Beijing that is casting a shadow over Morrison\u2019s first visit to the American capital as prime minister, but said, in order to do that, he needed a \u201ccomplete deal\u201d from president Xi Jinping, not a partial deal. Morrison said Australia was keen that America and China settle the tit-for-tat trade dispute which is imperilling global growth but he said Trump was attempting to safeguard important principles and set new benchmarks that would ultimately \u201cput global trade on a stronger footing\u201d. Trump said: \u201cChina wants to make a deal. I think we want to make a deal. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d The president played down the negative impact of the trade dispute on the Australian economy, declaring the economy was performing strongly. He said if the US settled the trade dispute, the Australian economy would perform even more strongly. Early on Friday, during remarks in the Oval Office, Trump held out the prospect of a military strike against Iran, including, possibly, with nuclear weapons, although the president later backtracked, and indicated his preference was for restraint. Trump said he was interested in building a coalition for military action with Australian participation, but then told reporters at a subsequent press conference Iran wasn\u2019t discussed, and Morrison then described Australia\u2019s possible participation as \u201cmoot\u201d. Morrison has used the visit to emphasise Australia\u2019s reliability as an American ally and the shared values between the two countries. Friday\u2019s White House program will culminate with a state dinner outdoors in the Rose Garden at the White House. The state dinner is the first offered to an Australian prime minister since the Howard era, and Trump will also accompany Morrison on a side visit to a new Australian-owned paper recycling mill in Ohio owned by the billionaire box maker Anthony Pratt later in the week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
