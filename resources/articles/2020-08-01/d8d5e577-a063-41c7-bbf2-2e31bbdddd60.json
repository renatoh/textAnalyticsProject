In a letter to the chief executive, Richard Masters, Amnesty has suggested changes to the owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test that would disqualify prospective owners \u201con the grounds of contributing to human-rights violations\u201d. It comes after the collapse of the Saudi Arabian bid to take over Newcastle, a move Amnesty described as \u201csportswashing\u201d. The test prevents individuals from becoming directors if they fail to meet certain limited criteria. These include having previously been disqualified from holding such a role, having been subject to a bankruptcy order or having an unspent criminal conviction in the UK. The test does prevent a director from being appointed if \u201cin the reasonable opinion of the board, he or she has engaged in conduct outside the United Kingdom that would constitute an offence \u2026 if such conduct had taken place in the United Kingdom\u201d. The offences described are limited to \u201cdishonesty\u201d, however, including \u201cdishonestly receiving a programme broadcast from within the UK with intent to avoid payment\u201d. The phrase human rights does not appear in the text, which runs to six pages in the Premier League handbook. Amnesty\u2019s proposed changes were devised by two corporate lawyers, David Chivers QC and Seamus Woods of Erskine Chambers, and centre on a proposal that a director should not be considered fit and proper if \u201che or she has been complicit in an egregious or consistent violation(s) of international human rights law\u201d. The changes also suggest that a director should be barred if their association with \u201cany government or organisation\u201d might risk \u201cbringing the league, the club and/or the game into serious disrepute\u201d. Amnesty claims the changes would not cut across any of the league\u2019s other commitments. \u201cThe controversy around the Saudi-Newcastle takeover has been a major wake-up call \u2013 the Premier League urgently needs to get its house in order,\u201d said Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK\u2019s director. \u201cThe owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test is hopelessly unsuited to the task of vetting who gets to own and run English football clubs \u2013 it needs a serious overhaul. At present, anyone wishing to sportswash their reputation by buying into English football can do so knowing that even their involvement in war crimes or torture wouldn\u2019t stop them. \u201cThe owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test simply hasn\u2019t kept up with modern trends in international football ownership, not least with foreign powers buying their way into the game.\u201d The Premier League said it would not comment on the letter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
