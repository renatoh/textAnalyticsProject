The leader of the union movement directly addressed the controversy surrounding Setka for the first time on Monday afternoon, as the ACTU and Labor faced pressure over a response one anti-domestic violence campaigner labelled \u201cpathetic\u201d. Setka, the Victorian secretary of the CFMMEU, has claimed he was \u201ctaken out of context\u201d following an Age story that reported he told a union meeting Batty\u2019s advocacy had led to men having fewer rights. He told the paper he had not criticised Batty and had great respect for her. Setka could not be reached for comment. Last month, Setka also told a Victorian court he would plead guilty to charges of harassing a woman. On Sunday, the ACTU condemned \u201call acts of family and domestic violence\u201d in a three-line statement that did not refer to Setka\u2019s criticism of Batty and noted the harassment charge was before the courts. On Monday afternoon, McManus went further, while also praising Batty for making an \u201cincredible contribution to efforts to end family and domestic violence\u201d. \u201cIf the comments attributed to John Setka reported over the weekend are correct, they are appalling and totally unacceptable,\u201d she said. \u201cThey do not reflected out values or the work that unions do to campaign against family and domestic violence and should be immediately withdrawn and apologised for.\u201d Batty, whose son Luke was killed by her estranged husband in 2014, told the ABC on Monday that Setka\u2019s remarks were \u201cludicrous\u201d and an example of \u201csomebody whose leadership role really needs to be challenged\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m quite astonished with those comments,\u201d said Batty, who was on Monday appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia for her advocacy. \u201cRather than feel, you know, men have less rights, we have so much more to gain by recognising that moving forward we\u2019re [moving to] a place of equality.\u201d The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, had been criticised for not personally commenting, though he has since demanded Setka apologise. The federal Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, described Setka\u2019s remarks as \u201ctotally unacceptable if that\u2019s what he said\u201d, but also played down his significance within the party. Speaking before McManus\u2019 fresh comments, Phil Cleary, an anti-domestic violence campaigner who has in the past held roles with the Electrical Trades Union, lashed the response from Labor and the union movement as \u201cpathetic\u201d. \u201cThe statement from the ACTU is not good enough,\u201d Cleary told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough talking in generalities about condemning violence against women, everyone will do that. \u201cThe question is, what about when a key person in your movement says that a campaigner, a woman who lost her son to a violent man, is the reason for men losing their rights?\u201d Cleary, whose sister was murdered by her former partner in 1987, said he had great respect for Andrews for establishing a royal commission into family violence. Andrews has won plaudits for speaking out against men\u2019s violence, and often uses social media to call out misogyny. Tim Lyons, a former assistant secretary of the ACTU, has said in a tweet that Setka \u201chas to go\u201d, while Jake Wishart, president of Victorian Trades Hall\u2019s Young Workers Centre, also said Setka \u201cshould step down immediately\u201d. Setka\u2019s role as state secretary is elected, meaning it would be hard to remove him unless he stood down. He is a member of the Labor party. Sources close to the ACTU said that internal discussions around Setka\u2019s future began some time ago and are ongoing. They said the ACTU would argue it would not be appropriate for Setka to remain in his role if a harassment conviction was recorded. The CFMMEU was contacted by Guardian Australia for comment. Asked to respond to Cleary\u2019s criticisms, a Victorian government spokeswoman pointed Guardian Australia to a statement from the premier. \u201cThese comments are unacceptable and he should apologise for them,\u201d Andrews said in the statement. He described Batty as a \u201cgreat Australian\u201d and said the government was \u201cproud of her work in combatting family violence\u201d. \u201cGiven that a number of these matters remain before the courts, it would be inappropriate to comment further,\u201d Andrews said. Albanese said on Sunday he was \u201con Rosie Batty\u2019s side\u201d and described her as a \u201cgreat Australian\u201d. The Labor leader said he had never met Setka, who he said did not have \u201cany great significance\u201d within Labor. On Sunday, the ACTU said it would \u201ccontinue to advocate for workers\u2019 rights to a safe home, community and workplace and take a stand against family and domestic violence\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
