El Ni\u00f1o, considered one of the most important climatic phenomena globally, involves a warming of the Pacific Ocean\u2019s surface. The Spanish term for \u201cThe Boy\u201d, referring to the infant Jesus, as El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s effect may be most evident around Christmas. There are two types of El Ni\u00f1o, those in the eastern Pacific, close to South America, and those further out in the central Pacific. As expected, the report found El Ni\u00f1o events have become more frequent. It also showed a change in the type. \u201cWe used to have roughly the same number of central and eastern Pacific events,\u201d says the lead researcher, Mandy Freund, of the University of Melbourne. \u201cMost recently, we only have one eastern Pacific event and nine central Pacific events.\u201d Both types of events mean reduced rainfall in Asia and Australia, but the eastern Pacific version brings heavy rainfall and flooding in the Americas, while central Pacific events produce dry conditions. El Ni\u00f1o events also affect other weather phenomena around the globe, including cyclones and colder British winters. The research will enable scientists to create better models to predict the effects of future El Ni\u00f1o events."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
