Tebbit, who served happily in cabinet with Willie Whitelaw, thinks David Cameron is surrounded by people who \"don't know how the other half lives\". The implication that Cameron's background makes him too privileged to appeal to the masses is damaging. That is why it delights his many enemies in all parties. And it makes sense to minds irrevocably committed to the redundant paradigm that Labour is the party of progress and the Conservatives a club for toffs. But if parentage, education and marriage are the criteria, the prime minister is at least as fortunate as his opponent. Take in access to power elites, and Gordon Brown had the truly blessed youth. Granted, \"Brown's Sugars\" who flitted around him at Edinburgh University wore miniskirts, not the gowns of the Bullingdon Club hangers-on. But Gordon hardly noticed them. He was staying in with Princess Margarita of Romania. As for schools, well, the rigidly selective \"e-stream\" experiment - which fast-tracked the brightest, Brown included, to university - was designed to give the children of Fife miners opportunities as good as anything at Eton. Those who imagine academic selection and socialism are incompatible might note how well it worked. What really matters are the very different contexts in which Brown and Cameron were exposed to early life opportunities. Here cultural differences between England and Scotland matter. Cameron's family certainly had more disposable income than John Ebeneezer Brown, the Presbyterian minister, and his wife, Jessie Elizabeth Souter. But Gordon's family were very much part of Kirkcaldy's aristocracy - something his father's job would have guaranteed if Mrs Brown had not been the privately educated beneficiary of modest legacies. The family had a lot more than their neighbours. If stable family life, reverence for education and encouragement to excel are privileges, Brown had them in abundance. He also had access to the network of connections that link the Church of Scotland and the Scottish Labour party. There are parts of Scotland where the established church's influence on the establishment party is more important than the C of E's cameo as the Tory party at prayer. The difference is that Scotland's establishment party is Labour and it privileges its own to undeniable effect. The reputation for nepotism that damaged it in last May's contest with the SNP is no invention. Seen in this context, Brown was about as fortunate as a politically ambitious young Scot could be. Forget Eton and Oxford. He had the right family, the right school, the right university and, of course, the left opinions. It is easy to understand why he appeals so powerfully to that brilliant interpreter of English middle-class prejudices, Paul Dacre. The Daily Mail chief perceives in the prime minister commitment to the values his newspaper cherishes most dearly - the values of an establishment rooted in middle-class conservatism. Had he been born in Kent, Brown would have been a Conservative. But he was born in Glasgow, so what he shares with England's establishment isn't party affiliation, but an armour-plated sense of entitlement. I doubt Cameron has anything approaching Brown's faith in his right to power. Etonians have been disliked for decades. The country has only just begun to perceive the true nature of the Scottish Labour party. I shall be stunned if the Conservative leader emerges from his party conference looking as smug as Gordon Brown did this week. Never mind the polls, Cameron simply lacks the upbringing. \u00b7 Tim Luckhurst is professor of journalism at the University of Kent and a former editor of the Scotsman. t.luckhurst@kent.ac.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
