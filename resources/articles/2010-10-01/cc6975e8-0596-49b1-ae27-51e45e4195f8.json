All season Keiron Cunningham has had Old Trafford in mind as a suitable stage on which to end his outstanding St Helens career and after scoring tries in the last three matches at Knowsley Road, he remains on course to make amends for a hat-trick of Grand Final defeats by Leeds and to lift the Super League trophy for the first time as Saints captain after his 497th and last appearance for his hometown club. Last Sunday, less than 24 hours after Wigan had earned the right to face Saints in what will be their first Grand Final appearance since 2003, the former Warriors hooker Terry Newton \u2013 with whom Cunningham had so many battles throughout the Super League years \u2013 ended his own life. Former club and international team-mates such as Paul Deacon, Sean O'Loughlin and Stuart Fielden remained visibly stunned at the pre-Grand Final press conference the following day. Wigan have taken numerous orders for No9 Newton shirts in their club shops this week, and a minute's silence will be held before this evening's kick-off in memory of a player who polarised opinions during a controversial career but who leaves rugby league, as Fielden said, \"a worse place for not having him around\". Cunningham paid his own tribute to Newton on the eve of the game. \"Terry was a close friend of mine and I, along with the entire St Helens club, am deeply saddened by his loss,\" he said. \"I have no doubt all supporters will want to pay their respects to Terry and his family.\" Over Billinge Hill in Wigan, a former bodybuilder who lives near Newton's old home in Pemberton will have thoughts for both hookers when he watches the game on television. Jack Penman is 64 and for almost 20 years he has taken an interest in Cunningham's development that both of them describe as paternal. \"Keiron was 16 when two old friends of mine who were working at St Helens, Geoff Lyon and Eric Hughes, brought him to meet me and told me that he could be a good rugby player,\" Penman said. \"He was a bit wild when he was a kid, having lost his father at the age of 10. But I realised as soon as I met him that he had something special about him, and all he needed was to be guided in the right direction. \"I taught him how to train correctly in the gym, and to eat the right food to build muscle, strength and stamina, and how to control the pain when training intensively in the gym. Only so many people can take a certain level of pain. You hit a wall, but if you can push yourself a bit further, that's when the muscle gets extra growth. It's unorthodox and it takes a lot of bottle to push your body past that level. Once you've done so many reps, you become numb to it. Look at Keiron and there's power there \u2013 not just size, either, but will-power. Look at what happened when he came on last week. There's an aura around him, a magnetic personality, which comes from his discipline in life.\" Wigan will also seek to draw inspiration from an all-time great when Shaun Edwards presents the current generation of players with the shirts in which they will aim to win the club's first Super League title since 1998. But he, like Cunningham and everyone else at Old Trafford, will turn his thoughts to the tragically departed Newton before the St Helens talisman takes centre stage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
