When Mr Johnson refused to look at the photo of four-year-old Jack Williment-Barr asleep on a hospital floor (Tories accused of lying to distract from image of boy on hospital floor, 10 December), he was simply doing what boarding school trained him to do \u2013 reject his feelings and carry on as though nothing has happened. It is time we took seriously those people who have been shedding light on the fact that ours is a nation managed largely by \u201cbereaved children\u201d who often lack the emotional capacity and empathy to do their jobs properly. Not long ago (12 June) George Monbiot suggested that anyone who wants to stand in a national election should receive a course of psychotherapy. Mr Johnson\u2019s inadequate response to human suffering certainly shows his need of such treatment. Helen Channer Aupperlee Pilsdon, Dorset \u2022 If any more evidence were needed to prove Polly Toynbee\u2019s point (The Tories will take revenge on all who blocked them. Be afraid, Journal, 10 December), Johnson\u2019s snatching of a reporter\u2019s phone provides the perfect metaphor for what to expect after Thursday. No proprieties, no nice discussions, just smash-and-grab politics. Tim Shelton-Jones Brighton, East Sussex \u2022 Professor Tobias advises us to vote appropriately and also to watch The Dirty War on the NHS. (Letters, 9 December). I Googled it, to discover that this new film by the highly respected John Pilger, described by ITV as \u201ca powerful and timely investigation [which] gives voice to those who warn that time may be running out in the battle to save both the NHS and the fundamental human right to medical care\u201d is being broadcast, by ITV, on 17 December. Timely? Time is running out. Come on ITV, show it on the 11th, at peak time. Mary Brown Chiswick, London \u2022 Just reading Thomas Cromwell by Tracy Borman and came across this regarding the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538: \u201cAlthough the king promised to use his newly won gains to build many new churches and cathedrals, there is only evidence that he erected six. Instead, most of the lands from the dissolved monasteries were sold off to the nobles as a way of securing their loyalty and generating more funds.\u201d Plus \u00e7a change\u2026 Rick Barker Stocksfield, Northumberland \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com \u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters \u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?
