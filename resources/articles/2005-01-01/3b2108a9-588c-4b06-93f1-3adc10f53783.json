The Wales midfielder has signed a three-and-a-half year deal after passing a medical today and agreeing personal terms. The news was announced on the club's official website, and Savage will be unveiled to the media on Friday. The midfielder is likely to make his debut for Rovers in Monday's local derby against Bolton. The protracted saga has finally been brought to conclusion after Blackburn increased their initial bid of approximately \u00a32m. Before Christmas, Savage revealed his desire to leave Birmingham in order to be closer to his unwell parents who live in Wrexham. However, when it was revealed that Blackburn is further from Wrexham than Birmingham, supporters' sympathy quickly dried up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
