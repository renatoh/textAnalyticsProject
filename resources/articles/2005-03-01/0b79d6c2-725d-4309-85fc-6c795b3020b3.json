The whole subject of immigration and asylum has become such a focus of acrimonious debate that I find it very difficult to grasp the implications. The numbers \"game\" leaves one confused - statistics can be made to prove almost anything the politicians want if they try hard enough! Sorry for being cynical - but it is hard to get a true picture of the situation. As far as life in my own locality is concerned, it is really a non-issue - we live so far north and away from the major cities that immigration does not affect us. Yet, judging by a few conversations with a few people, it would seem that there is a vague anxiety about being overrun by foreigners, which I guess must come from the papers that are read. Over the centuries, Britain has accepted many seeking asylum - perhaps not that willingly - but, in time, such groups do appear to become integrated. I believe this has been the right thing to do, and that those who fear for their lives, and those of their families, should be helped. Such people, escaping persecution, should be given the opportunity to be properly and justly treated to validate their claims. I think it is immoral to keep such people in custody for long periods; that this includes children is even worse. I support the Medical Foundation for victims of torture for that reason. However, it appears that, in much Labour and Tory polemic at present, there is a (intentional?) confusion between the asylum seeker and the immigrant. The process at the points of entry should be humane and just, but much of what I read shows this is not the case at present. In a small land, such as Britain, it is reasonable to provide a measure of control so that there is accommodation and the opportunity to work for those who are permitted to remain. I do not agree with the policy that prevents people from working while awaiting a decision. The growth of the use of illegal immigrants in certain areas of work is wrong, and those who exploit these people should be prosecuted. In particular I find the views of the Tories objectionable in that they are playing into the hands of the BNP and stirring up hatred against many who have been here for many years and contribute to society. That Labour has joined in with this makes this floating voter unable to vote for either on this issue. Such tough talk does not help to create the kind of society I want to live in."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
