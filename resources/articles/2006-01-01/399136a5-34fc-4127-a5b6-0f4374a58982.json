We've got Bono, Mark Oaten (who resigned as Lib Dem home affairs spokesman over reports that he made secret visits to a male prostitute) and dodgy clairvoyants, plus chickens, tax forms and trees ... In the RED: U2 frontman Bono is spearheading a new venture called RED, which will see some of the world's best-known companies launching products that will raise funds to support HIV/Aids programmes in Africa. American Express is one of the four launch partners and has announced details of its new RED fee-free credit card, available from March 1, where 1% of all spending up to \u00a35,000 and 1.25% of any annual spend over \u00a35,000 will go to the Global Fund, a public-private partnership that has committed more than \u00a32.5bn to Aids, tuberculosis and malaria programmes. An extra \u00a35 is donated if you use the card within a month of receiving it. The APR for purchases is 12.9% - for details go to americanexpressred.co.uk Medium no longer at large: A Swiss \"clairvoyant-medium\" who terrorised vulnerable Brits with letters claiming an \"occult force ... is determined to destroy you\" has been stopped in his tracks by the UK's Office of Fair Trading. The letters purported to be from a \"Grand Master of Occultism\" called Morgan T and were personalised to make them more convincing. They offered people protection from this \"silent threat\" - at a cost of \u00a317. The OFT traced the letters to a Swiss firm called ETLA, which has now given assurances that it will not send any more of them to people in Britain. Security cheques: There were worrying claims made this week that sloppy call centre security could be putting millions of people's cash at risk. An investigation into 20 of Britain's biggest financial services companies (including banks and credit card providers) found that call centre staff at almost half, could be coaxed into accepting less stringent identity checks by customers claiming to have forgotten their passwords. US voice technology firm Intervoice, which did the research, says the problem is that call centre staff are trained to be helpful and, in their efforts to avoid hacking people off, will often willingly offer up alternative security checks. Needless to say, it declined to name the guilty parties. Ruffling feathers: Talking of call centres, Swiftcover.com, the new-ish online insurer which has shaken up the car insurance market, now hopes to do the same with travel cover. Swiftcover infuriated the call centre industry with its ads featuring rows of chickens wearing headsets sitting behind computer terminals. It claims cutting out call centres means it can offer \"some of the cheapest premiums available\". Which? magazine says Swiftcover is quite competitive in several categories, particularly for under-50s, so it may be worth a look. Oaten makes pension plans: When he's finished lying low, Liberal Democrat MP for Winchester, Mark Oaten, is likely to be pressed into service to help employees of computer giant IBM, which is the latest company to reveal it is making \"changes\" to its final salary pension scheme. The US company won't say what its plans are, but you can bet it won't be good news. It has long had a fraught relationship with its UK workers and retirees over pensions. One of the company's main UK sites is near Winchester, and Mr Oaten has in the past met with IBM UK senior management to make them aware of the concerns of his constituents. Final reminder: If you haven't done your tax return yet, put down this paper and do it now because the deadline is Tuesday. If you've been held up by a missing receipt or statement, you'd be better off making an educated guess and getting the form back now than incurring the \u00a3100 penalty for filing late, says accountancy firm Saffery Champness. \"It's far better to file your return on time and then amend estimated figures at a later date, than delay filing the return for the sake of a few outstanding calculations,\" it adds. Donating a woodpile: Standard Life has given \u00a3100,000 to conservation charity Trees for Life to help replant a forest in the Scottish Highlands as part of a paper-reduction drive ahead of this year's avalanche of member mail-outs relating to its planned demutualisation. Under its \"Treemail\" scheme, Standard Life had pledged to purchase a tree seedling for each of its first 100,000 policyholders who sent their email address so the company could communicate with them via email instead of post, and thereby save on paper. Parents get the blues: Here's some news that will depress parents trying to stop their children growing up too quickly. A company called bluecorner has linked up with teen magazines Smash Hits! and Bliss to issue pre-paid payment cards to children as young as 13. The cards, which are backed by MasterCard, have to be loaded with money and can then be used to buy goods or make cash machine withdrawals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
