The Millers looked destined for top spot thanks to Alan Lee's close-range effort midway through the second half until David Nielsen, introduced nine minutes earlier, swept home with three minutes remaining. Rotherham and First Division summit meetings are one of football's more rare bedfellows, and their manager Ronnie Moore has had his work cut out keeping expectations realisti cally low in the wake of hitting promotion favourites Millwall for six in the season opener. As was the case last season, when the Millers avoided the drop only on goal difference, their home form will be the key to survival, and they again gave notice that their muscular approach at their compact home will see them easily capable of garnering two-thirds of the 50 points Moore has earmarked for survival. Norwich's quest for points is aimed at a more positive goal, and they showed no hangover from their play-off final defeat by Birmingham three months ago in beating Grimsby 4-0 on the opening day.. With space at a premium last night the only chances looked likely to come from mistakes. Norwich's midfielder Steen Nedergaard duly obliged with seven minutes gone, the Dane's hash of a clearance bouncing off his chest but dropping into the waiting arms of the goalkeeper Robert Green as it bounced towards goal. Norwich again came under threat as the first half drew to a close, but Green smothered a long-range Martin McIntosh free-kick before Rotherham striker Alan Lee back-heeled wide from close range when well-placed. The second half followed a similar pattern, with Norwich content to soak up pressure and Rotherham's frustration showed midway through the second half when Darren Byfield failed by inches to divert in a Lee cross with the goal gaping."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
