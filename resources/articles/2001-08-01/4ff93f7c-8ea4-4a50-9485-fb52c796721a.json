Tam Dalyell who, as father of the House is the longest continually serving MP in parliament, criticised reported moves by the government to abolish the post of private secretary in favour of \"policy advisers\". Mr Dalyell, who has been MP for Linlithgow since 1950, said such a change would stop civil servants from offering critical advice to politicians. \"This is the whitehousisation of Britain - it is far from academic because if you have a position that where civil servants in some cases ... are likely to work directly to political appointees, this really does change things,\" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. \"I'm concerned that the traditional importance of civil servants to warn and, above all, to give unpalatable advice ... will be undermined knowing that their careers may be determined not by the honesty of their advice but by other considerations.\" Mr Dalyell warned that Labour MPs were unlikely to sanction the move without protest. \"I think you will find that the new House of Commons in the second term will be very much less amenable to changes of this kind than in the first term, when no one wanted to rock the boat because Labour had been out of office for 18 years - and they can be forgiven for that. \"This parliament, members will become their own people.\" Talk about it Who should succeed Hague?
