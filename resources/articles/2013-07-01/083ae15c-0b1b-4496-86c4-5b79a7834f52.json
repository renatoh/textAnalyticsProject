Open daily 11am-2am, 21+ ID required The Pioneer Memorial Museum Skip the sales pitch at the crowded Temple Square and head up the street to the Pioneer Memorial Museum for a real history lesson and a close look at the odds and ends of Salt Lake\u2019s pioneer ancestors \u2013 and some are very \u201codd\u201d. Curated by the Daughters of Utah Pioneers, this museum houses six floors of Victorian artefacts, from pioneer hair art, photographs and handmade chairs to a room full of carriages.

Admission free Red Butte Gardens Salt Lake is known for its mountainous landscape and outdoor activities, but to see the flora and some of the fauna without breaking sweat, Red Butte Gardens is perfect. On a hillside overlooking the University of Utah campus and next door to the impressive Natural History Museum, Red Butte Gardens boasts one of the best views of the Salt Lake valley and has an array of themed gardens and picnic areas, floral exhibits and garden workshops. Summer nights are best though, as the gardens host to Sundance Institute films and an outdoor concert series that has featured the likes of Neko Case, Steely Dan and Kenny Loggins. \u2022 300 Wakara Way, +1 801 585 0556, redbuttegarden.org. Open daily, seasonal hours. Adults $10, 3-17s $6 Ken Sanders Rare Books This place is a literal mess of books \u2013 from floor to ceiling \u2013 you will need help from one of its friendly staff if you\u2019re looking for something in particular. Browsing usually yields the best rewards though (and is encouraged). In addition to antique and rare books, one of Ken Sanders\u2019 specialities is \u201cUtah and the Mormons\u201d, with a collection of newspapers, handbills and pamphlets from the early Mormon church. Every bookstore is an adventure, but particularly one whose motto is \u201ccreating chaos out of anarchy for a better tomorrow\u201d. \u2022 268 South 200 East, +1 801 521 3819, kensandersbooks.com. Open Mon-Sat 10am-6pm Tower Theatre Open since 1921, the Tower Theatre is the centrepiece of Salt Lake\u2019s bustling 9th and 9th district, which is full of restaurants, boutiques and, local favourite the Coffee Garden. Buy a bag of popcorn and sit in the balcony to watch a first-run indie film, picked by the Salt Lake Film Society. The Tower\u2019s lobby also serves as a video-rental archive, and the theatre and its sister venue, the Broadway, are both used for the Sundance film festival every winter. \u2022 900 South 876 East, +1 801 321 0310, towertheatre.com The City Library Even before you take a step inside, the City Library is one of Salt Lake\u2019s most remarkable contemporary structures. The five-storey building is all glass on one side, overlooking a large, limestone plaza with waterfalls, fountains, pools, sculptures, shops and an amphitheatre. There\u2019s also an art gallery on the fourth floor, the largest \u2018zine collection in the country, and a variety of free community events, workshops, films and concerts. In summer you\u2019ll often find yourself in the middle of a cultural festival between the plaza and the historic City and County Building across the street. \u2022 210 East 400 South, +1 801 524 8200, slcpl.org. Open Mon-Thurs 9am-9pm, Fri-Sat 9am-6pm, Sun 1-5pm Urban Lounge There\u2019s a handful of great music venues in Salt Lake City (Kilby Court and The Shred Shed can\u2019t be missed), but the Urban Lounge wins the popularity award for twentysomethings. Whether it\u2019s an up-and-coming national indie-rock band or SLUG (SaltLakeUnderGround) Magazine\u2019s Localized showcase, there is always live music to be found and heard \u2013 paired with a bottle and a shot \u2013 at the Urban Lounge. The crowd depends on the night of the week and who\u2019s playing, but you\u2019re sure to be entertained. \u2022 241 South 500 East, +1 801 746 0557, theurbanloungeslc.com, 21+ ID required Randy\u2019s Record Shop Randy\u2019s Records (serving up tunes since 1978) is unique because \u2026 well, it has everything. Salt Lake\u2019s indie record store ratio is high (make a stop at Raunch for punk and hardcore; The Heavy Metal Shop for \u2026 you guessed it) but Randy\u2019s is a good place to get a taste of it all. In addition to its extensive vinyl collection \u2013 which the staff know by heart \u2013 there\u2019s a great collection of turntables \u2013 and the staff know their stuff there, too. \u2022 157 East 900 South, +1 801 532 4413, randysrecords.com. Open Tues-Fri 11am-7pm, Sat 10am-6pm Gilgal Sculpture Garden It doesn\u2019t get any weirder than Gilgal \u2013 ask the locals. This \u201csecret garden\u201d, on a side street in the middle of town, is one of Salt Lake\u2019s gems. Carved and curated by Mormon bishop and businessman Thomas Battersby Child Jr in the late 1940s, the garden is an arguably unsettling tribute to the man\u2019s life and religion, featuring stone-carved sculptures and engravings portraying Biblical stories and church history. Highlights include a curious Joseph Smith Sphinx, an unflattering self-portrait by Child, a sacrificial altar and random carved body parts strewn here and there. \u2022 749 East 500 South, +1 801 582 0432, gilgalgarden.org. Open Mon-Sun 8am-8pm (Apr-Sept), 9am-5pm (Oct-Mar). Admission free Utah Museum of Contemporary Art The word groundbreaking may not often be used to describe art in Utah, but in the case of the Utah Museum of Contemporary Art (Umoca), it fits like Andy Warhol and Campbell\u2019s Soup. With four gallery spaces and an auditorium, Umoca exhibits work by contemporary local, national and international artists. If there is a \u201cgood\u201d time to view art in Salt Lake City it\u2019s the third Friday of every month for the Gallery Stroll, of which Umoca is always a part. Many of the galleries plan their opening receptions during this time, which provides a great opportunity for patrons to meet artists. \u2022 20 South West Temple, +1 801 328 4201, utahmoca.org. Open Tues-Thurs 11am-6pm, Fri 11am-9pm, Sat 11am-6pm.
