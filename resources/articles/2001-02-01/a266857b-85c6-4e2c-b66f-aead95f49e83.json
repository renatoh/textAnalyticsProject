But for all their League Cup and play-off prowess, the most cherished trophy has eluded them at the final stage four times, most recently 32 years ago. Perhaps a sense of history weighed on Peter Taylor's mind when he admitted to feeling \"nervous\" about the \"shock potential\" of this tie. But his fears were dispelled after 15 minutes, by which time the Premiership team were two goals to the good and pondering the quarter-final draw. A little belief can go a long way, which is why Taylor surprised his players after the recent poor performance against Everton by telling them they could win the Cup. In a puzzling week, Leicester's manager also issued a \"I'll do it my way\" message saying that he would continue to change tactics and formations, only to revert to the trusted 3-5-2formation his men prefer. The contest was a greater puzzle for Danny Wilson's men who, after an unbeaten start to 2001, must have wondered what they had done to deserve such early punishment, only for Leicester to extend the hand of mercy for a long time afterwards. Even the workaholic Robbie Savage faded from view but Bristol could not capitalise because, for all their attractive football, their finishing betrayed Nationwide status - although Brian Tinnion and Mickey Bell struck the woodwork with curving free kicks that utterly beat Simon Royce. Between times the hapless Matt Hill - later to give away the killing penalty - headed into his own goal and Scott Murray saw his point-blank shot diverted by Royce's legs. Wilson thought the result \"flattered\" Leicester and might have disputed their opener, a diving header from Dean Sturridge which looked suspiciously offside. Taylor, inevitably, thought the scoreline was merited, pointing out his side had been \"very professional\" in enjoying their \"best start to a game for some time\". Disappointingly for Taylor, Ade Akinbiyi - told to \"get angry\" by the manager after being dropped - offered little evidence that he can adjust to Premiership standards. But at least Leicester's record \u00a35m signing shaded the battle of ex-strikers, with Tony Thorpe's subtle skills fading in the face of imposing defenders. Wilson slipped up against Taylor in this round of the Cup last year too, but Saturday's elimination was far less embarrassing than Sheffield Wednesday's at Gillingham. There was a verbal slip too as Wilson - perhaps still locked into the Kingstonian marathon - praised his side for their impressive football \"against a top-eight Conference team\". Leicester will be without Roberto Mancini for the remainder of this campaign, the Italian having returned home to talk to Fiorentina about becoming their next coach. Taylor spoke in the past tense about the 36-year-old striker's Leicester career. \"I don't regret having him here one bit and the players enjoyed him being here. I hope he's coming back - but I'm not 100 percent sure about that.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
