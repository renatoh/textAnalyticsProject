The bid, which was put together with the backing of private equity firm 3i, completes a significant turnaround for the 1,200-strong chain, which includes names such as Bairstow Eves, Mann &amp; Co and John D Wood. Countrywide said in a statement its shareholders would be offered 490p a share in cash. In addition, Countrywide's stake in the property website Rightmove will be distributed to Countrywide shareholders, valuing the bid at 550.6p a share. This represents a 19% premium to Countrywide's closing price on September 13 when 3i first announced it had approached the company about a takeover. Countrywide profits were all but wiped out a year ago after a series of interest rate rises left it with a 30% fall in revenue. However, the big recent rise in property sales - particularly in London and the south east where the company is well represented - brought Countrywide back into the black. In August it reported profits up \u00a32.4m to \u00a343.9m, helped by a one-off gain of \u00a316.4m from the sale of shares in Rightmove. It kept a 22.5% stake in the website. Christopher Sporborg, chairman of a group of independent Countrywide directors, said in a statement: \"We have had the time to evaluate all aspects of the offer, and for other potential offerors to come forward. It is now right to move forward and I am confident that our recommendation is in the best interests of Countrywide shareholders.\" 3i said Countrywide's \"development will be facilitated by the support of a long-term investor such as 3i and we look forward to working with the executive team to continue its strong track record in its relevant markets\". Mr Sporborg said he would leave, as previously announced, at the end of the month. The company will continue to be led by the managing director Harry Hill who becomes chairman in January. The investment by 3i is one of the first deals to come out of its new \u00a35bn buyout fund which it raised last month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
