Then Instagram happened and an Insta-worthy outfit became all about the standout visual \u2013 and so the neon boom began. Menswear designers, from the more traditional (Calvin Klein, Burberry) to the purveyors of cutting-edge streetwear (Off-White, Vetements), have incorporated it into their designs. You can see its domination everywhere: on the \u2019Gram, where too-cool-for-muted-blue pop stars like Bad Bunny and J Balvin unabashedly push the neon agenda; and on Love Island, where it loomed large via the eye-popping swimwear. Back here on terra firma, however, wearing hi-vis could simply mean you\u2019re holding a sign for a golf sale. Perhaps the best approach to cracking the \u201chow to work neon\u201d conundrum is via a well-thought-out accessory, such as a scarf or hat. Here, I\u2019m wearing a beanie in a lollipop-lady-referencing shade of fluoro, twinned with a muted blue twill jacket. This feels like a good way of raising the fun stakes: my hat provides a not-so-subtle way of lifting a boring winter outfit without frightening the oncoming traffic. With neon, a little goes a long way (see also: gloves and socks). The multicoloured sports shoe is also an option but, be warned, you could look a bit \u201cdad on the lash\u201d, which might not be what you\u2019re gunning for. What I\u2019m wearing, AKA \u201cthe rave beanie\u201d, is an undersung member of the winter hat family \u2013 think of it as the crazy aunt of the bucket hat and the acid house bandana. I have to admit it still feels a little weird, however, partly because my outfit reminds me of the Global Hypercolor days of the 90s, but also because the focus is on my hat, rather than, say, my top or jeans. It\u2019s a bit like getting Destiny\u2019s Child back together and giving Michelle the lead on Survivor, while Beyonc\u00e9 is consigned to the back doing the \u201cooohs\u201d. Still, it\u2019s all about the outfit as a whole and, alongside the jacket, I feel I\u2019ve accessorised it with a facial expression that screams: \u201cIf you remember the 90s you weren\u2019t doing it properly!\u201d I think I\u2019d definitely be a hit on the \u2019Gram. Right? Please be generous with your likes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
