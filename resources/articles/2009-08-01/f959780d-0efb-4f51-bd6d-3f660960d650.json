When even the most mild and reasonable intervention against anti-social behaviour can lead to horrific retribution, the answer seems to be no. Why would you even think about rebuking teenagers for making a racket in the cinema? One woman in Leeds, hoping to enjoy the new Harry Potter film with her husband and kids, did that last week, and had bleach poured over her head in revenge, burning her face and leaving her fearful of damage to her eyesight. And who would dare to ask youngsters to stop using foul language on the bus? Stan Dixon, a former soldier from County Durham did that last year and he died of head injuries inflicted on him in a vicious retaliatory attack. As for coming to the aid of a stranger in trouble, don't even think about it. No less a person than Boris Johnson has warned against wading in, saying he would tell his children to walk away rather than help someone in distress. Understandable feelings from a concerned father, but I can't help seeing this raw hostility and the consequent refusal to help others as an extreme expression of a wider malaise; part of an insidious individualism where narrow selfish interests always come first, where politicians put self-enrichment ahead of public service, and where bankers continue to award themselves bonuses while the rest of the economy gasps for air. At any rate, people in my little patch of south-west London seem to have taken the mayor's advice to heart: a few weeks ago I was the victim of an attack in broad daylight, in the middle of a crowd of people, not one of whom seemed to notice, let alone try to help. I can't say I expected them to, nor do I really blame them for putting self-preservation first, and fortunately, it wasn't a serious assault. And my experience pales into utter insignificance compared with that of a good friend of mine called Tony McGarahan. His younger brother Frank lost his life after going to the aid of a homeless man being beaten by a gang of youths in Norwich last September. Although the large McGarahan clan will never recover from the tragedy, Tony's sadness is leavened by huge pride in his brother for being simply incapable of turning a blind eye to a person in trouble. The last thing any of us wants is for more individuals to pay a terrible price for making a stand for civic values; the answer has to be in collective action. A few years ago, on a train, I watched as a man began waving his lighter flame closer and closer to the face of a young girl sitting opposite him. When a fellow passenger told him to stop, Lighter Man became aggressive. Then a small miracle happened: instead of looking out of the window, or burying their heads in their books, one by one, everyone in the carriage joined in: Lighter Man got off, shamefacedly, at the next stop. What Frank McGarahan instinctively recognised is that if we all become too frightened to intervene, we are surrendering supposedly safe communal spaces such as parks, buses and cinemas, and allowing them to become enemy territory which we must each navigate in fearful isolation. But people like him can't change things by acting alone \u2013 they need us to support them and not to turn away. If we go the other route, and decide we should just look after ourselves, because it is foolhardy to try to help others, we will all end up diminished, lonelier and more vulnerable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
