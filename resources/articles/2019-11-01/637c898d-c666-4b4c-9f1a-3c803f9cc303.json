The men\u2019s match \u2013 the first Rugby Championship match of the season in Australia and new coach Dave Rennie\u2019s first outing on home soil \u2013 will form one half a double-header, with the Wallaroos meeting the Black Ferns on the same day in a women\u2019s Test. Sydney\u2019s $2bn stadium development plans mean ANZ Stadium and Allianz Stadium will both be out of action when next year\u2019s series kicks off, bringing the Bledisloe to Melbourne for the first time since 2010. It is the second year running that Sydney will not host a Bledisloe match and the first time in the series\u2019 history that Australia hosts two games with neither in Sydney. The third game of the 2020 series has already been confirmed for Brisbane\u2019s Suncorp Stadium on October 17. Rennie, who was last week confirmed as Michael Cheika\u2019s successor, will officially take charge of the Wallabies in July, and he will come up against another newly-installed coach in Melbourne, following the end of Steve Hansen\u2019s All Blacks reign post-World Cup. Australia will also play Ireland in a two-Test series, on 4 July at Suncorp Stadium and 11 July at the SCG. Those matches will be the first internationals under Rennie. Rugby Australia boss Raelene Castle said it represented a new era for the national team, which had a disappointing recent quarter-final World Cup exit. \u201cI think it\u2019s a fresh start, I think that\u2019s the excitement,\u201d Castle said. \u201cWe don\u2019t quite know what any coach is going to bring and that creates the anticipation. \u201cThe Australian public are going to want to get to know Dave Rennie and what he\u2019s about and the style of rugby that he\u2019s going to play so by the time we get to this Test match we will have seen a little bit of that.\u201d Australia and New Zealand have played each other in the Victorian capital four times previously since the first game was held at the MCG in 1997. Two further Tests were hosted at the MCG, and the fourth, nine years ago, at Marvel Stadium."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
