For those whose teenage years were punctuated by 9/11, the Iraq war, and the Democrats' near-miss in the 2004 elections, just the idea of Barack Obama is irresistible. On the sprawling campus of the University of Missouri, located in a key battleground state in Tuesday's national primary, there is an even more compelling reason to be for Obama. Supporting Hillary Clinton means social death. \"Having a hip candidate like him makes it difficult to support someone else,\" admits Mark Buhrmester, 21, who until recently headed the Democratic club on campus. \"Young people talk about politics a lot. Barack Obama is in style so if you don't support Barack Obama, it's like you are not in style.\" Such a strong, almost cult-like following could prove a crucial advantage for Obama heading into Tuesday's titanic contest in an election year which has seen more young people voting than ever before. A young generation of Democratic activists argues their concerns are different than those of their elders. They claim to have grown up in an age when race and gender no longer mattered, and they are unmoved by the great culture wars over abortion and gay marriage. Their issues are the war in Iraq, global warming, and the cost of health care. But their real concerns run even broader, towards a wholesale rejection of the coarsening of America's political climate. \"We've grown up in a time where there has been extraordinary bitterness in Washington. We have a president who doesn't care about the problems that we face and a Congress that is in support of that uncompassionate agenda,\" said Buhrmester. \"When you come of age in the age of George W Bush, it makes it very easy to be cynical - and very easy to be a Democrat.\" Obama has been as much a beneficiary as a catalyst of that sentiment. He owes his first win over Hillary Clinton in the Iowa caucuses to overwhelming support from young voters, as well as his landslide victory in the South Carolina primary a week ago. In the closing days before Super Tuesday, that support is percolating upwards through the generations - drawing parallels with the activist era of the sixties after years when commentators have been deploring the apathy of the young. When Caroline Kennedy endorsed Obama this week, she said the Democratic candidate reminded her of her father, the late John F Kennedy. But she was also strongly persuaded by her three teenage children who were all Obama supporters. \"They were the first people who made me realise that Barack Obama is the president we need,\" she told a rally in Washington DC. Not that the Clintons are giving up on the youth vote or Missouri. Chelsea Clinton visited the campus earlier this week; Bill Clinton is due in town tomorrow. Hillary Clinton will hold a rally in St Louis on Sunday, a day after an appearance by Obama. But Obama's appeal to young voters has reconfigured the political landscape for the Democrats. Although Democrats of all ages are energised this year, there is no keeping pace with the enthusiasm of young voters. Turnout among young voters in the Iowa caucuses rose by 135% over 2004, against 90% for the overall population. Overwhelmingly those young voters came out for Obama. He won the under-25 vote by a margin of 5 to 1. His popularity among young people stayed solid even in states he went on to lose. In New Hampshire, Obama carried the under-25s by a 3 to 1 margin over Clinton although, crucially, she won more voters than he did in the 25-29 age group. In Nevada, Obama still outpolled Clinton among the under-25s by 2 to 1. In South Carolina, where Obama got more than twice as many votes as Clinton, he won three to one in the youth vote. Other politicians in this election season have resonated with young voters, and on the internet. There was a time when you could not set foot on Mizzou - as locals call it - without seeing a chalk scrawl on the pavement reading: \"Google Ron Paul\". Paul is a Texas congressman running for the Republican nomination. But Obama was able to translate his virtual appeal into votes, and into a campaign strategy that effectively uses new social networking tools - like Facebook - as well as old-fashioned organisation. The Obama camp was the first to found a local supporter chapter on campus in the spring of last year. By summer break, local organisers had a list of several hundred supporters, said Glenn Rehn, who heads Students for Obama on campus. Over the summer, Rehn, 25, a final year student who is a veteran of campaigns, spent a few days at Camp Obama in Chicago learning how to organise, \"how to create a buzz\", as he says. When the new term began last August, he put his new skills to use and set up information tables once or twice a week. Yes, Obama had tens of thousands of supporters on Facebook, but Rehn and other organisers still resorted to phone lists to get people to events and repeated pleading with their fellow students. The early exposure was crucial, he believes, to attracting first year students who arrived on campus looking for belonging. \"A lot of new kids, freshmen starting in the fall, really didn't have anything to be involved in,\" he said. Clinton's supporters on campus trace a similar disaffection with the Bush era. Denise Gilmore, 22, the daughter of an African-American army officer and a German mother who was raised in Germany and Kansas, sees her coming of age as a process of disillusion. For her, the breaking point came in the spring of 2003 when Colin Powell, then the US secretary of state, stood before the United Nations to make the case for the war on Iraq. Powell had always been a \"trusted source\" for her, Gilmore says, but as it is now known he was using false information. Redemption came during a break from college in Amsterdam when she was struck by the goodwill Clinton had overseas. \"That made me think if she already has that trust abroad, she is what we need.\" But Gilmore admits she is a minority on campus. The Facebook group of Clinton supporters on this campus of 21,000 is barely 35 or 40 members. She insists she would be equally proud to have Clinton or Obama as president, and that the skills she is learning now will serve her for a lifetime in politics. Other campus activists offer a similar argument, that they are the first wave of a coming generation of politically engaged youth. The media may be obsessed by the greying of the baby boomers, with the first born of the post-war population bulge now picking up their pension cheques - but a new generation is just coming into its own. As proof of their growing influence over the electorate, they point to the efforts by all the campaign to get their attention: the Facebook groups, the YouTube videos, even the occasionally cringe-making pronouncements of candidates about what's on their iPod. (Obama claims to listen to Beyonce and Jay-Z). By 2015, voters under the age of 30 will make up one third of the US electorate. Their concerns may echo those of the sixties, but for this year at least they are in the age of Obama."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
