This may go some way toward explaining why Relic, the extraordinary debut feature from writer-director Natalie Erika James, left me a total wreck \u2013 overwhelmed and in floods of tears. Yet I\u2019d wager that this spine-tingling, heartbreaking tale of a woman with Alzheimer\u2019s becoming lost in the labyrinthine corridors of her mind, and her home, has a universal power that will resonate with anyone, regardless of personal experience. Emily Mortimer is Kay, the somewhat distanced daughter of Edna (Robyn Nevin), an elderly widow who lives alone in a remote house in Victoria, Australia. Local police check in on Edna regularly but \u2013 to her evident shame \u2013 Kay has been less attentive, dismissive of Edna\u2019s claims that an intruder has been coming into her house. When Edna goes missing, Kay and her daughter Sam (Bella Heathcote) hurry to the increasingly decrepit family home to search for her in the woodsy environs of Creswick. But when Edna mysteriously reappears, she has no memory of where she\u2019s been. Practical Kay wants to move her mother to a Melbourne care home; idealistic Sam wants to move in with her gran and take care of her. Yet it\u2019s clear that there are forces at work that neither of them fully understand, forces foreshadowed in James\u2019s award-winning 2017 short Creswick (which she also co-wrote with Christian White), in which a father tells his daughter: \u201cIt\u2019s like someone else is living here.\u201d While Kay is haunted by dreams of a cabin riddled with creeping black mould, Sam finds her memories of the benign gran she loves usurped by a more volatile presence, prone to random aggression and plagued by paranoia. Meanwhile, the house itself starts to mirror the contortions of Edna\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s-afflicted mind, full of strange turns and unremembered passages that give physical form to her own sense of fear and bewilderment. Described by James as a film about \u201cthe true terrors\u201d of \u201cgrieving for the loss of someone while they\u2019re still alive\u201d, Relic (like its Australian stablemate The Babadook) is a horror movie with a heart, a film that uses a surreal narrative to tell a story absolutely rooted in reality. There\u2019s a touch of Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s The Fall of the House of Usher in the psychogeography that James evokes, slipping subtly from the classic, naturalistic tones of early scenes into more expressionist darkness as we venture deeper into the lonely carnivals of Edna\u2019s mind. There are echoes, too, of the dream logic of Eraserhead, with Relic making emotional rather than logical \u201csense\u201d. But it\u2019s the awesome sense of longing, loss and, ultimately, love that is the film\u2019s strongest suit, putting it in the same category as Hideo Nakata\u2019s Japanese masterpiece Dark Water, which similarly blended fears with tears to soul-shaking effect. Brilliant makeup effects and physical animatronics keep things real, recalling the plastic realities and visual metaphors of early David Cronenberg. Meanwhile, composer Brian Reitzell and sound designer Robert Mackenzie work in perfect harmony, creating a soundbed that blends diegetic noise with loud silences to keep the audience on their toes. Released in the UK under the FrightFest Presents label, this Halloween offering contains plenty to scare but much more to make you care."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
