In a tweet, the US president cited controversial Australian advertising campaigns aimed at asylum seekers \u2013 which employ language such as \u201cNo Way \u2013 You will not make Australia home\u201d to deter people from trying to seek refuge by boat. \u201cMuch can be learned,\u201d Trump said, which came before a meeting with the Australian prime minister in Japan. Some of the images praised by Trump on Thursday surfaced in a 2014 advertising campaign that was lashed by critics as \u201cfear-mongering propaganda\u201d. Australia has invested heavily in advertising campaigns \u2013 including videos and graphic novels \u2013 in attempts to deter people from boarding boats to Australia. \u201cThe Australian government has introduced the toughest border protection measures ever,\u201d one of the advertisements shared by Trump says. \u201cThink again before you waste your money, people smugglers are lying.\u201d The campaign has drawn praise from far-right figures including the Dutch politician Geert Wilders, who borrowed the \u201cNo way\u201d slogan to launch an anti-immigration political party. Australia\u2019s policy says people who seek asylum by boat have their claims processed at offshore facilitiess where they can languish for years. The government refuses to bring them to Australia if they are found to be refugees and seeks to have them resettled in a third country. Border force officials also turn back asylum seeker vessels when it is \u201csafe to do so\u201d. The suite of policies are regularly described at the UN as breaching international law. Trump has adopted his own hardline immigration policies at the US-Mexico border and his administration has been accused of adopting a policy to separate asylum seeker children from their families in an attempt to deter immigrants from attempting to enter the country. The president has sought to build a wall along the entire border, but much of the spending needed has been blocked by the US Congress. Photographs showing the lifeless bodies of a drowned Salvadoran father and his daughter put further pressure on the Trump administration\u2019s policies this week. In 2017 Trump praised Australia\u2019s harsh asylum seeker policies, including offshore detention, in a call with the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, telling him: \u201cYou are worse than I am.\u201d Morrison is flying to Japan on Thursday for the G20. He is expected to encourage Trump to resolve trade tensions with China at a dinner meeting on the eve of the summit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
