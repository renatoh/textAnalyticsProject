The ... same ... old ... story! Morning everyone. Sadly it's not a great one for England fans: Freddie and co mustered a below-par 237 on a particularly good Cochin wicket, having stumbled throughout the innings after being 117-2 at one stage. Kevin Pietersen (again) took the batting plaudits with a cracking 77 off just 82 deliveries, but once he and Paul Collingwood (36) had been dismissed, it all started going wrong. Geraint Jones struck a battling 49 despite sustaining a leg injury - he won't be wearing the gloves in India's innings, meaning Matt Prior takes over and a substitute fielder will be required - but other than that there was little to write home about. With India needing less than five an over to seal this series, things are looking bleak. Unless you're an Indian supporter, of course ... Reasons to be cheerful: No1: um, the new ball might do something at the start of India's innings for the returning Matthew Hoggard and James Anderson. No2: Geraint Jones's impending absence? No3: OBO readers aren't as downcast as me. \"At least the Hogster's back and we've got two spinners (although one is Gareth Batty),\" says Andy Bradshaw. \"If we lose this, would I be the only one to suggest that it would be great for English cricket for Freddie to go down with a 'stomach bug' for the next three games and get a rest?\" More of your musings: \"Look on the bright side, would you?\" urges Ravi Shankar. \"The strange decision to play two wicket-keepers has actually paid off! But given Hoggard's form and our overpaid superstars' tendency towards overconfidence, this game isn't over yet.\" Hmm. \"I agree with Andy Bradshaw: mutton bhuna and some tandoori prawns should be on the menu for Freddie tonight,\" chuckles Vivek Bakshi. \"But who would be captain ...?\" The former captain's view: Nasser Hussain is chewing the fat with Mike Atherton, rueing the inability of England's batsmen to kick on and make really big scores. The problem, as he admits, is that Pietersen is head and shoulders above any other England one-day batsman at the moment, putting an unfair burden upon the Hampshire man. The solution? \"Our Test and one-day sides need to be brought as close together as possible,\" he emphasises. \"Duncan Fletcher needs to start looking at that soon.\" Beefy-watch: \"Has Ian Botham become completely disenchanted with the current ODI series and branched out into pastures new?\" wonders Ashley Williams. \"I am sure this morning at 7am he was doing the voiceover for Sky's Bollywood/Hong Kong-style film channel. Any other 'never thought I would be advertising' themes out there? Ramesh Powar and dieting products?\" 1st over: India 6-0 (Sehwag 6, Dravid 0), target 238 With Prior taking over from Jones behind the stumps, Ian Bell's day off is curtailed with a call to take over as substitute fielder. James Anderson gets us started in the oppressive Cochin heat, and almost makes an immediate impact: Sehwag takes a quick single and Anderson's shy at the stumps just misses and the batsmen scamper through for an overthrow. The bowler then drifts on to leg and Sehwag clips him over the infield to the deep midwicket boundary. 2nd over: India 11-0 (Sehwag 7, Dravid 2), target 238 Hoggard's spell opens with a no-ball, followed by another soon after. Defending such a weak total, England simply can't afford to concede cheap extras - as they have all through this series. Sehwag then gets a real let-off: his pre-meditated pull off Hoggard is skied towards leg gully, but despite staying in the air for what seems an eternity, no England fielders are on hand for the catch. Anderson, fielding in the area, appeared to see the ball late, although it would probably have needed Collingwood at his most electric to make up the ground and take the catch. 3rd over: India 16-0 (Sehwag 11, Dravid 3), target 238 A slower ball from Anderson down leg gives Sehwag the chance to replicate his loft over midwicket as he did in the bowler's last over. Even with his trademark static feet, Sehwag comfortably cracks another boundary. 4th over: India 24-0 (Sehwag 11, Dravid 11), target 238 Few rays of light for England in these opening overs as India continue to make comfortable progress. Now Dravid helps himself to a boundary with a firm pull to fine leg, followed by a crisp drive to cover. Collingwood just saves the boundary, despite appearing to tread on the ropes with the ball. \"Well, there's another positive for you - Bell is back in the field, one of the best close catchers in the game,\" writes Alex Holland. \"Quite why he lost his place to Shah remains a mystery to me - his recent one-day form (including practice matches) has been excellent, and Shah couldn't catch gastric flu in Delhi.\" 5th over: India 29-0 (Sehwag 12, Dravid 15), target 238 Regarding the earlier No1 reason to be cheerful, Richard Foster asks: \"Is there any sign of the ball swinging for these two bowlers?\" Barely, I'm afraid. Dravid jumps all over a rank bad delivery from Anderson, short and outside off stump; he mercilessly drags it to the square-leg boundary with the minimum of fuss. 6th over: India 42-0 (Sehwag 21, Dravid 16), target 238 Another wide, followed by another missed run-out attempt. Sehwag stutters out of the crease as he chases the single, but Bell's throw agonisingly misses his target. Sehwag would have been heading back to the crease had that one hit. Hoggard follows that with another no-ball and another wide: that's three and two wides from the England bowlers in this innings. India's bowlers delivered just one wide and two no-balls in the entire England innings. Sehwag then compounds the misery of a bad over by picking Hoggard's slower ball and tucking it down to the fine-leg ropes, before slogging him to long-on, with the ball taking one bounce before crossing the boundary. Anyone feel Hoggard is still unproven as a one-day bowler? 7th over: India 44-0 (Sehwag 22, Dravid 17), target 238 It's far too easy for India at the moment, with their opening pair showing just how good this wicket really is to bat on. The packed Cochin crowd is going wild, despite their cramped and rather warm conditions. \"With Ian Bell being such a good catcher (4th over), couldn't England put him behind the stumps, replacing Jones and freeing up a space in the side for one of their up-and-coming youngsters?\" wonders Ammon Cheskin. 8th over: India 45-0 (Sehwag 23, Dravid 17), target 238 Hoggard is hauled off with Flintoff deciding it's time to take the ball. Just the one run comes from his over. Meanwhile, here's this bullish prediction from Richard Jones: \"India will win in less than 32 overs.\" Possibly earlier, if England don't bag any wickets soon. 9th over: India 46-0 (Sehwag 24, Dravid 17), target 238 Any heavy-hitting punters out there? India are 1-7 to win this game, so if you've got \u00a37,000 spare and fancy making a relatively easy \u00a31,000 ... Then again, stranger things have happened than England coming back to shock their hosts at 13-2. Not many, granted. \"It's good to see England are adopting the same tactic my club does when we are on a loser,\" declares Andy Stiff. \"Bowl rubbish, let them knock off the runs and get down the pub early. Everyone should try it.\" 10th over: India 52-0 (Sehwag 25, Dravid 21), target 238 Better from the England bowlers, but not from the fielders. A tidy Flintoff over is wasted when Dravid's press to mid-on sees a frankly pathetic attempt at a dive from Pietersen let the ball scuttle underneath him and race away to the boundary. How England desperately need a wicket. 11th over: WICKET! Sehwag c Solanki b Blackwell 26 (India 54-1) Ah, there it is. The Somerset spinner is brought into the attack with the precise aim of prising Sehwag's wicket and it pays off - somehow. A long-hop outside off stump sees Sehwag attempt to pull the ball to deep midwicket, but he succeeds in merely finding Vikram Solanki's safe hands. No wonder Blackwell's got a sheepish smile on his face. \"Ammon Cheskin (7th over): is this a pen name for a mid-to-late-nineties England selector?\" says David Evison. \"I'm not sure what the profit of dropping an in-form (with the bat) Jones for an untried Bell behind the stumps. Admittedly, Bell should probably be in the team as a batsman but I'm pretty sure he would not be able to cope keeping wicket on the tricky sub-continental wickets. I'd far rather see Jones opening again with Prior left out and Bell in the middle order to seperate the big hitters trying to outgun each other.\" 12th over: India 58-1 (Dravid 24, Pathan 1), target 238 Well, that wicket came out of the blue, but it's given the England players a timely lift. Flintoff steams in with renewed enthusiasm, although four runs come from the over. Meanwhile, here's a quite outlandish OBO-spotting claim from Neil Stork-Brett: \"I was watching the last morning's play in the Australia v South Africa series earlier this week and during the presentations and the usual crowd scenes - I kid you not - there was a largish lad in a white T-shirt with the words 'Rob Smyth Fan Club' written on the front in black marker pen. Frankly, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.\" Or adjust your TV set? 13th over: India 66-1 (Dravid 30, Pathan 3), target 238 \"Any chance that the largish lad in the Rob Smyth Fan Club T-shirt was in fact Rob Smyth?\" asks Louise Wright. \"Was he a 'strawberry blond' wearing an iPod and the look of a man with a force-five hangover?\" Meanwhile, shoddy fielding from Blackwell sees Pathan's forward defensive needlessly roll over his foot and away for a single. Here's hoping that one run won't prove costly later in the match. Then again, Dravid cuts the next ball away for four more runs. \"David Evison (11th over) is now officially my arch-enemy,\" roars a serious-sounding Jack Fray. \"Not only did he deride my suggestion of re-instating Bell during the last ODI, but he now claims the idea as if it were his own. And there's a very good reason why Jones shouldn't open the batting: he's not good enough! Bah!\" 14th over: India 74-1 (Dravid 31, Pathan 10), target 238 A delightful prod down the ground becomes a delicious off-drive on this rock-hard outfield. Pathan may well open the bowling for his side, but he can clearly do the business with the bat as well, underlined by his cover drive for two off Flintoff's following delivery. \"After the fevered discussion on a very similar topic last Friday, and having received \u00a355 marathon sponsorship from generous OBO readers at www.justgiving.com/sebforsane, I'm looking for suggestions for something OBO-related to write on the back of my running vest for the big day,\" says top chocolate brownie maker Seb Falk. \"Has anyone got any suggestions? The way today is going, I can't look beyond 'OBOh no not again ...'\" 15th over: India 78-1 (Dravid 34, Pathan 11), target 238 \"Your mantra of 'England desperately need a wicket' clearly worked earlier, so maybe it's an idea for the upcoming OBO T-shirts (we all know reader power will mean these t-shirts will happen!),\" notes Chris Armstrong. \"'England desperately need ...' on the front, and punters can choose from a selection of words for the back. Options could be 'a wicket', 'rain', 'a miracle', 'a volunteer from the crowd who happens to have brought his kit and can bat for more than 10 minutes and can bowl an over without a wide or no-ball' Although this last one will only be available in XXXL.\" Four runs from Blackwell's latest over. And here comes Gareth Batty at the other end ... 16th over: India 82-1 (Dravid 36, Pathan 12), target 238 Arrrrrgh!!! Two spinners! Batty's first ball almost provides him with a caught-and-bowled chance, but Pathan just works the ball wide of his despairing - and rather hopeful - dive. Beyond that, it's another comfortable over for the batsman, who add four more runs to the total. \"I would like to suggest an OBO-related message for marathon-running Seb's vest,\" offers Ben Lait. \"How about 'Is it cowardly to pray for a sprain?'. Brilliant, eh? Oh.\" 17th over: India 85-1 (Dravid 38, Pathan 13), target 238 Collingwood is the latest man to be thrown the ball and he delivers a nice opening over. Pathan clearly wants to get stuck into his bowling, but a good line ensures he can't - for now - and that just three singles come from the over. \"I would just like to know where exactly this Matt Prior came from anyway,\" enquires Matthew Fry. \"He seems to have wandered into the team through the backdoor and certainly hasn't done anything to justify his place. Is he actually that bloke who used to run into Man Utd's (and other big sporting events) photographs [that'll be Karl Power] at inopportune moments before big games? Also, if you put him in a big shiny silver suit, he could easily pass for Dr Evil in Austin Powers.\" 18th over: India 87-1 (Dravid 39, Pathan 14), target 238 Pathan really is itching for a big hit, but manages to control his aggression well in the face of Batty's spin. He maturely opts for a single to cool his guns, as it were, and get off the strike. Just the two singles off the over. 19th over: India 94-1 (Dravid 44, Pathan 16), target 238 A tenth boundary of the innings, and arguably the best of the lot so far. Dravid merely flicks his wrist at a Collingwood delivery on off stump, beating the leg gully fielder as the ball flies away to the boundary. \"How about putting 'O no BO' under the armpits of Seb Falk's T-shirt?\" suggests Andy Gore. \"After running about London for 26 miles it may be quite apt.\" 20th over: India 102-1 (Dravid 44, Pathan 24), target 238 Wide and full down leg-side from Batty, twice in three balls. Pathan gives both the treatment they deserve with brilliant leg glances which speed over this glass-like outfield to the ropes. Um, how England desperately need a wicket ... \"Large man in a 'Rob Smyth Fan Club' T-shirt? It's clearly Bobby Key,\" smirks Adam White. \"Who else would love the curmudgeonly Smyth other than the man has long championed as the saviour of English cricket?\" 21st over: India 109-1 (Dravid 50, Pathan 25), target 238 Prior opts to stand up at the wicket for Hoggard's return, but all he can do is watch the first ball race through mid-on for four off Dravid's bat. Moments later Dravid has hit bat aloft to celebrate a 69th ODI half-century, an awesome record. Prior is then up to claim a nick of Pathan, but the umpire waves his appeal away. Replays show there was a tiny nick, but Hoggard's fatigued lack of appeal sums up England's day. \"Has anyone noticed that the BBC seem to have changed their over-by-over commentary style?\" notes Kenny Smith. \"It's much more chatty now - I reckon they are copying you lot. Mind you, they don't have people emailing in, so for witty badinage the guy is reduced to one-way banter with the Five Live commentators. Witness: 'Gus Fraser in the Five Live commentary box had a lovely Indian meal - funnily enough - last night, but had some trouble ordering wine. Apparently his Malayalam is only passable.'\" I'm actually quite scared. 22nd over: India 115-1 (Dravid 55, Pathan 26), target 238 \"Even though India are winning, the series is so dull - so hopelessly one-sided ... I wish India would lose six wickets in a heap and leave it to Sreesanth and Agarkar to save the day,\" declares Bisheswar Mukherjee. \"We need a challenge here.\" Hmm, a bit of charity never goes amiss, Bisheswar. Batty's over starts impressively enough with a ball which spins out of the rough to shock Pathan, but it ends badly with Dravid chalking up another boundary to square leg. 23rd over: India 121-1 (Dravid 56, Pathan 31), target 238 Pathan clubs Hoggard through mid-on for another boundary as this second-wicket partnership reaches 67. \"Another draining loss coming up, England will have a big political problem at 4-0 down,\" suggests David Price. \"Freddie is a bit of a totem in India and the Indian Board (and sponsors and TV) won't like it if he 'pulls a hamstring'. But in player value and real thinking - and for his own sanity - he should go back. Who should be the next captain? Ian Bell.\" 24th over: India 130-1 (Dravid 65, Pathan 31), target 238 Flintoff takes a power play, but Dravid sees it and raises it with blistering back-to-back boundaries from James Anderson's first two balls; the first is an uppish drive to long-on, while the next is a rasping cut to point. \"England's tour is unravelling right here,\" pronounces commentator Nasser Hussain, and he's not wrong, sadly. 25th over: WICKET! Dravid c Hoggard b Flintoff 65 (India 130-2) Another bizarre dismissal for an Indian batsman. Flintoff returns to the attack and his opening delivery, wide and outside off stump, sees Dravid simply play through the shot too early and loft the ball simply to Hoggard at mid-off. Perhaps a sign of fatigue from Dravid, who looked to be struggling from what seemed like a touch of cramp in the last over. \"These turning wickets make it meaningless for working out what our World Cup XI should be,\" writes Nick Diffusion. \"We'll surely play four seamers in the Windies and our batsmen tend to prefer the quicker tracks out there. Bring back Bell.\" 26th over: India 139-2 (Pathan 36, Kaif 4), target 238 Mohammad Kaif joins Pathan at the crease as England bid to gain some momentum and apply some pressure to the new batsman. No such luck, however, as Pathan clips Anderson away for a helpful boundary. \"In a display of blind faith, I think now is the time to stick some cash on England to win the next World Cup,\" trumpets David Purvis. \"The odds will be going through the roof following this embarrassing pummelling, but by the time the WC comes around we will have worked our what our best team is; plus get a few of the injured players back, throw in the seam-friendly conditions in the West Indies, and bob's your uncle!\" Perhaps not 'through the roof' just yet, mind: England are 13-2 joint second favourites with Pakistan - Australia are 5-2 faves. 27th over: India 145-2 (Pathan 40, Kaif 4), target 238 Oh, Freddie, Freddie. Tsk. The big man's looking tired and his mood won't have been helped by two more wides and Pathan's Chinese cut for four. \"I noted your poker-betting analogy about Freddy's powerplay (24th over) - though if Dravid saw it and then raised he was technically string betting and should take a sharp rap on the knuckles for poor poker etiquette,\" explains Ed Herman. \"Given the fact that England are massive 'dogs' here and have an alarming tendency to 'fold', while India look 'the nuts' and quite capable of 'raising' their game, perhaps you could even give some thought to extending your metaphor? No? Oh.\" 28th over: WICKET! Pathan st Prior b Blackwell 46 (India 152-3) He managed to restrain himself earlier in the innings, but finally Pathan cuts loose against Blackwell, blasting a low exocet of a drive over the ropes at long-on for six, before proving the architect of his own downfall. He dances down the wicket, but Blackwell beats him in the flight; Prior takes a comfortable stumping chance. \"The BBC has just told us that 'Hoggard is being milked like a knackered old cow',\" smirks Andrew Connell, who I'll let off for checking a rival OBO service simply for making me snort coffee over my keyboard. Is there a difference in milking cows depending on their age and 'knackered-ness'? 29th over: WICKET! Kaif c Anderson b Flintoff 5 (India 152-4) Hello, hello, what do we have here? A truly magnificent catch from Anderson at short extra cover! Kaif drove uppishly, but wildly, and Anderson flung himself up to his right, taking a brilliant mid-air catch. Game on again. \"You mean to tell me that England have the same chance of winning the World Cup, as we did winning this match nine overs in?\" says an incredulous James Hamilton. \"With that reckoning, we don't stand a chance in the Windies!\" 30th over: India 153-4 (Yuvraj 0, Raina 1), target 238 New batsmen Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina arrive still in the box seat, with the run-rate still a comfortable four or so an over. However, Blackwell's maiden over, the first of this innings, helps add just a modicum of pressure to their situation. \"Does anyone know where I can buy Hoggy milk?\" asks Andy Gore. \"Surely this is a fantastic opportunity to entice kids to eat healthily, \"Pour a pint of Gold Top Hoggy on your Cornflakes to make you grow big and strong.\" 31st over: India 157-4 (Yuvraj 4, Raina 1), target 238 Yuvraj gets off the mark with a lovely pull to deep square leg, swivelling on to his back foot and dispatching Flintoff to the boundary. Still, just the one scoring shot off the over. \"In my experience of growing up on a dairy farm, old knackered cows were put out to pasture (or sent to the knackers yard) as they didn't really produce too much milk,\" recalls Barry MacDonald. \"It was the young heifers that produced most milk. Hope that helps.\" No end! 32nd over: India 160-4 (Yuvraj 6, Raina 2), target 238 A half-chance for Blackwell. Yuvraj comes down the track and blasts the ball straight at the bowler, who does superbly to get a hand on it and prevent an inevitable four. It still runs away for two runs, but had he taken that catch it would have been up there with some of the very best. \"Let's cut Hoggy a bit of slack,\" says Tim Doyle. \"I saw him playing for Juventus last night; after running around aimlessly for 75 minutes he managed to get himself sent off. Throw in the travelling and, all in all, it's been a physically and mentally exhausting 12 hours for the great man.\" 33rd over: India 171-4 (Yuvraj 8, Raina 10), target 238 Good running between the wicket from Yuvraj, in particular, turning what looked like two singles into even more. Batty's over is a ragged one, with a needless no-ball to boot, as India reduce their victory target to 67 runs off 102 balls. \"Is Barry (31st over) the legendary 'Old' MacDonald that schoolkids sing about?\" enquires Andy Darley. \"Can we confirm exactly what he had on his farm, to put the matter finally to rest?\" 34th over: India 176-4 (Yuvraj 12, Raina 11), target 238 Excellent fielding from Batty at third man, diving at full length to deny Yuvraj a boundary. Five easy runs still come from the over, though, and that's all India need. \"How likely is it that kids will drink Hoggy Gold Top if they think their hair will turn out like his?\" writes Andy Pechey. \"After I was told eating bread crusts would make my hair curly I refused to eat them for years. My hair still ended up looking ridiculous, mind. 35th over: India 178-4 (Yuvraj 13, Raina 11), target 238 A twelfth extra of the innings comes as Batty loses his line with a wide, but it's a good over from the spinner, conceding just the two runs. Collingwood's also off the field for treatment after picking up a nasty cut to his elbow. Meanwhile, Barry 'Old' MacDonald's been on again about what was on his famous farm: \"We had some cows, and some sheep and some chickens and some pigs,\" he remembers. \"They all got slaughtered due to either foot and mouth or bird flu.\" 36th over: India 180-4 (Yuvraj 14, Raina 12), target 238 Another good over from Blackwell keeps the batsmen tied down to just two runs. It's now 58 runs off 84 balls, but India still look comfortable. Then again, if England could just prise one or two more wickets; their innings capitulated from this point, remember. \"I kid you not,\" says Richard O'Hagan suspiciously. \"The Director General of the National Farmers' Union is Richard MacDonald and his middle name really is Auld. See under 'CBEs' in this link.\" 37th over: India 185-4 (Yuvraj 16, Raina 14), target 238 Good batting from Yuvraj and Raina, picking off easy singles and nudging themselves ever nearer to the winning line. It really is only India's to throw away now. \"I'm not surprised the animals on Barry's farm (35th over) got slaughtered,\" declares Phil Smith. \"With the combined threat of foot and mouth and bird flu there's worse things the animals could do than get on the sauce.\" Honk. 38th over: India 192-4 (Yuvraj 21, Raina 16), target 238 As Yuvraj cuts Blackwell behind square for a timely boundary, it strikes me that Flintoff's spin pairing should be leaving the attack - asap. If he wants the wickets he needs, having Blackwell and Batty giving up relatively easy singles and failing to seriously pressure the batsmen, then surely Anderson, Hoggard or himself need to be bowling? 39th over: India 205-4 (Yuvraj 34, Raina 16), target 238 Well, Anderson is handed the ball, but he immediately goes for two boundaries. Yuvraj first uses some excessive top-hand action to cross-bat the ball straight past the bowler, before nicking one low to Prior's left and beating his low dive. If a first slip had been in place, then an easy catch could have been taken. Anderson then loses his line outside off and Yuvraj majestically climbs all over it to drive through extra cover for four more. 40th over: India 208-4 (Yuvraj 37, Raina 16), target 238 Another 50-partnership from the Indian batting order, underlining the class and depth of their one-day line-up. This looks like being their eighth successive one-day success, and with the way this series has gone so far, you wouldn't necessarily bet against them making it 11 in a row before England fly home. Three runs off that Blackwell over, keeping up with the required run-rate easily. 41st over: India 212-4 (Yuvraj 39, Raina 18), target 238 Series organisers are getting the man-of-the-match motorbike award ready, but as Hoggard comes back for another bowl, he can at least be safe in the knowledge that he won't be riding off with his second roadworthy prize of the tour. Any other interesting ideas regarding man-of-the-match prizes that could be adopted over here? \"Is there any reason why Monty Panesar was not added to the one-day squad in a Hoggard-esque manner?\" wonders James Poole. \"Surely his Test performances have established him as England's premier spinner after the injured Giles, as well as confirming he has the mental strength to excel in the international arena. I can understand the preference of Blackwell in the shortened game, but Gareth Batty? Surely it is time to leave Batty in the county game and start giving others a chance - starting with Monty.\" 42nd over: India 219-4 (Yuvraj 44, Raina 18), target 238 Out comes physio Dean Conway to treat Flintoff for apparent cramp. Or is that the timely 'hamstring strain' we were discussing earlier? Either way, Flintoff leaves the field for the time being. When play resumes, Yuvraj closes in on an artful half-century with another boundary off Anderson. It's just a matter of time as to when this pair want to end proceedings. \"Thanks to Richard O'Hagan for his sharp-eyed detection of Auld MacDonald in the list of CBE's (36th over) for his service to agriculture. On viewing the complete list it appears that rare and unusual middle-names may give some indication of whether you will receive an award: John Despenser Spencely, Paul Maximilian Rayner, William Macquarie Lyne, Kenneth Peat Forrest, Thomas Dacombe Eddy, Richard Temple Cox, Alexander Dalgety Adamson,\" writes Ed Wannagettagongquik Barnard. 43rd over: India 224-4 (Yuvraj 48, Raina 21), target 238 Another tough caught-and-bowled 'chance' goes begging as Raina almost takes Hoggard's chin off, blasting the ball straight back at him. Hoggard did superbly to a) get his head out of the way, and b) even manage to get a hand on the rocket as it flew at him. 44th over: WICKET! Raina c Blackwell b Anderson 21 (India 224-5) Raina's impatience at ending this match results in him skying Anderson to mid-on, where Blackwell takes an easy catch. The fans are still going crazy as it means Mahendra Dhoni's on his way to the crease. 44th over: WICKET! Yuvraj c Prior b Anderson 48 (India 224-6) Two balls later and Anderson strikes again. Now Yuvraj's attempt to hit out sees him beaten by Anderson, flashing and nicking behind to the diving Prior. The fans have gone a little quieter all of a sudden as Powar walks out. 45th over: India 232-6 (Dhoni 7, Powar 1), target 238 Pumped up for one final effort, Hoggard roars in and bounces himself into no-ball territory. Not what England needed with so few runs to defend at this stage. Dhoni clips a single away, before Powar's fortunate Chinese cut adds another run. The Cochin fans then get what they wanted as Dhoni rocks forward to drive Hoggard to the extra-cover boundary. Just six runs to win. 46th over: India 235-6 (Dhoni 9, Powar 2), target 238 Batty's off-spin gets another over and, with the crowd baying for Dhoni to clobber a series-winning boundary or more, just three singles are scored. 47th over: India 237-6 (Dhoni 10, Powar 2), target 238 The inevitable conclusion to this game still won't come, extending England's misery into one final over. The Indian squad are already celebrating in the stands, with Anil Kumble apparently in charge of official commemorative photographs. 48th over: India 238-6 (Dhoni 11, Powar 2), target 238 Flintoff, back on the field after a brief spell of treatment, refuses to give Dhoni an easy chance to win the game with a boundary or a six, leaving his field deep and enabling him to nudge a series-sealing single. Postamble: Well, that was, er, fun. Another game that England will feel they could have won, but another game the tourists have managed to let slip through their particularly greasy fingers. Again they capitulated from a match-winning position with the bat, while their bowlers again lacked the consistency and discipline to seriously trouble a confident and in-form Indian line-up. Thanks for all your emails, sorry I couldn't use them all. Cheers, James"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
