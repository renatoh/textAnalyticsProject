Hardly the most romantic solution. I think I'd rather get a bigger bed. Caitlin Price, bed buyer for John Lewis, tells me what else I should consider ... \u25b6 The biggest myth is a hard bed \u2013 you need a supportive one. \u25b6 Start with the mattress. Test out how each one feels for you. Your shoulders, hips and knees should be able to sink into it so your spine can remain in a straight line. \u25b6 Aim for a higher spring count as it will provide more support. Pocket springs are preferable, making the mattress feel more stable. \u25b6 The greater the variety of fillings inside the mattress (cotton, lambswool, Egyptian cotton, mohair), the more you will feel as though you are being cradled by it. Memory foam or latex have antimicrobial properties and so are good for people with allergies. \u25b6 Choose together. With mixed-tension mattresses, each side can be individually customised. \u25b6 It is said you get a better night's sleep from a mattress and divan (fabric-covered) base. Buy them together as they work in partnership with one another. \u25b6 Should you prefer a bedstead, there are two types \u2013 a sprung slat that gives more of a spring, and a solid slat that has a firmer feel. \u25b6 If your bed squeaks, get a new one. A good one shouldn't do that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
