The New Zealander has grown up steeped in traditional African rhythms, before picking up formal jazz training and then catching the music world by storm as one third of soul act Electric Wire Hustle. With the 2013 release of his debut solo album, called One, Manzanza tied together his diverse musical passions, and threw in some classic hip-hop and R&amp;B grooves for good measure. Joining Manzanza onstage when he plays the Spiegeltent on 16 September will be his new afro-soul ensemble, the Eclectic \u2013 including his father and afrobeat maestro Sam Manzanza. Simone Young discussing Mahler\u2019s R\u00fcckert Lieder and Symphony No 6 This year the Queensland Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Simone Young, will play Mahler\u2019s R\u00fcckert Lieder and Symphony No 6 at the Queensland Performing Arts Centre\u2019s Concert Hall on 12 September. The last movement of the symphony is 30 minutes long, and according to Young, it tells the story of a hero hit with the \u201chammer blow of fate\u201d. The original version had three hammer blows, the third of which kills the hero, after which the piece disintegrates and ends. At the time of composition Mahler himself had experienced two terrible hammer blows of fate: losing his position as head of the Vienna Philharmonic and one of his daughters died from illness. \u201cHe was very superstitious and removed the final hammer blow from the piece, believing it would herald his end as well,\u201d said Young. \u201cBut I laugh in the face of superstition and I took the original.\u201d Chanteuse Superstar \u2013 Lady Rizo Lady Rizo is an American singer who kicked off her career playing to the blue-rinse crowd on cruise ships, before moving to New York. She describes herself as \u201cthe product of a night of unrestrained indulgence between Peggy Lee, Mel Brooks, Nina Simone, Dean Martin and Janis Joplin\u201d. It\u2019s little surprise to discover she flips through music\u2019s history books for inspiration \u2013 her act glitters with old school glamour, and the kind of razor-sharp barbs that recall the Golden Age of Hollywood. When she takes to the Spiegeltent on 12 September, and two shows on the 13 September, expect vivid tellings of often tender and funny stories, interspersed between utterly transformed covers from the songbook of American classics. Grace \u2013 Jeff Buckley Both the lives of folk artist Tim Buckley and his son, Jeff, were cut tragically short: Tim in 1975, when he was just 28 from a heroin overdose, and two decades later Jeff drowned in the Mississippi River at age 30. The two had apparently met just a handful of times, but through their stirring music will forever remain connected. Honouring that legacy on 25 and 26 September at the Concert Hall of Queensland Performing Arts Centre will be Martha Wainwright, Casper Clausen (Efterklang), Willy Mason, Camille O\u2019Sullivan, Steve Kilbey (the Church) and Cold Specks led by guitarist/producer Gary Lucas with his band Gods and Monsters. Clearly the songs of both men continue to make a deep impression on the musical world. My Heart Is A Wheel \u2013 Megan Washington 2014 was a big year for Megan Washington. She took to the TedX stage in Sydney and opened up to a live audience about her tendency to stutter, then released a highly confessional, romance-stirred album There There. When Guardian Australia last spoke to her she had decided to lay off the music-as-therapy. \u201cMy art doesn\u2019t have to play that role any more and probably my next record will be a disco record about trying to find a car park.\u201d With her two sold-out shows at the Spiegeltent on 5 and 20 September, Washington is playing on home ground. For those who\u2019ve missed out on a ticket, perhaps the audience can suggest she DJ at an after party \u2013 just look for the nearest car park."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
