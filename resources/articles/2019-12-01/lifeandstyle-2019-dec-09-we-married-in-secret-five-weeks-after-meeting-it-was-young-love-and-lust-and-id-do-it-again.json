The bar was busy, so he and his date began chatting to other people. \u201cI thought Laura was the most beautiful woman I\u2019d ever seen. I had to speak to her.\u201d The pair discovered they were both students at local universities and quickly hit it off. \u201cI\u2019d never seen such a well-dressed college kid,\u201d says Laura. \u201cHe had lovely manners and seemed very grown-up for his age.\u201d At the end of the night, she gave him her number but he lost it. \u201cI remembered the prefix of the number for the building she lived in, so I called about 50 people until I found her.\u201d Over the next few weeks, he took Laura to some of the city\u2019s nicest bars and restaurants. Then he invited her for a homecooked Valentine\u2019s Day meal. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea how, but the discussion turned to marriage,\u201d says Laura. \u201cIt sounds insane, because we were only 18 and 20 and we barely knew each other, but we just decided it was a great idea.\u201d Ten days later, they drove down to Virginia to get married, without telling their families. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think it through at all,\u201d says Jay. \u201cEven on the drive down we were both thinking how mad it was. It was young love and lust. We just went for it.\u201d A few months later, the couple confessed their secret to their families. \u201cMy parents were really upset. My dad has always wanted to walk me down the aisle,\u201d says Laura. \u201cMy family were a bit more accepting,\u201d Jay says, \u201cbut Laura\u2019s really struggled. We have a good relationship now but I completely understand why they were so angry.\u201d Although many rushed weddings end in tears, Jay and Laura were determined to work through any teething problems. \u201cAt the beginning, we had nothing. No money, no home. It was tough,\u201d he says. The couple moved to Philadelphia after they married, where Laura completed her college degree. In 1995, they went to Georgia for two years, where Jay studied, before they both moved Minneapolis-Saint Paul in Minnesota, where they still live. \u201cLuckily we found out we did actually like each other,\u201d Jay laughs. \u201cWe were so young we didn\u2019t care about the material stuff. We just built a life together.\u201d Jay now runs a printing business, while Laura works in a wellness clinic. They \u201clove the outdoors and share an interest in politics,\u201d says Jay. Once every four years they travel to Iowa to check out the presidential candidates. They waited 10 years before having children. \u201cWe decided we wanted to spend some time building our relationship first,\u201d says Laura. Their two boys are now 17 and 16 and they have three rescue dogs. \u201cI\u2019ve grown up with Laura,\u201d says Jay. \u201cShe\u2019s the most well-meaning person in the world and she makes me want to be a better person. She still has this air of mystery about her, too, even now.\u201d Laura laughs. Jay calls her \u201cpart of my DNA\u201d. They have no regrets about marrying so quickly. \u201cWhen I tell people our story, they say: \u2018That\u2019s crazy,\u2019\u201d says Laura. \u201cI mean, I probably spend more time choosing a purse now. But it worked out.\u201d Jay says he would make the same decision in a heartbeat. \u201cIn hindsight we rushed things a bit, but now she\u2019s my best friend and the mother of my children. I\u2019d do it all over again every time.\u201d \u2022 Want to share your story?
