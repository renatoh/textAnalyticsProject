The call was revealed in documents tabled in the NSW upper house on Friday that were requested by the state opposition following a Guardian Australia investigation. Bronwyn Taylor is the sister-in-law of the federal energy minister Angus Taylor. The documents tabled state that in August 2018, the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH) received a report of \u201cpotential unlawful clearing of native grasslands\u201d on a property in Nimmitabel, in the NSW Monaro region, that is owned by Fairross Pty Ltd. Fairross is owned by Bronwyn Taylor and her husband, Duncan Taylor. The documents state that Duncan Taylor called the OEH on 13 September 2018 and identified himself as the property owner. On the same day, Bronwyn Taylor made a separate call to OEH in which she \u201cadvised OEH that she was a member of the state parliament but was calling as the landowner\u201d. \u201cMinister Taylor stated that they had done a self-assessment of the grassland and the area in question was not comprised of over 50% native ground cover, meaning that an offence had not been committed,\u201d the document says. Under NSW law, landholders can clear grassland without approval if it comprises less than 50% native species. The paper, which was written as a response to a question without notice, says OEH concluded their investigation on 2 October 2018 and found no evidence that the clearing was in contravention of the Local Land Services Act. \u201cOEH found that the landholder had undertaken their own assessment which indicated to them that the grassland was comprised of less than 50 per cent native species,\u201d it says. Bronwyn Taylor said on Friday that OEH had investigated a complaint in 2018 and \u201cfollowing a review of photographic evidence, determined that Fairross had met all of the requirements set out by Local Land Services\u201d. \u201cAs the landholder, I spoke to the OEH officer who was handling the complaint. I disclosed that I was a member of parliament and that I was calling in my capacity as a landholder,\u201d she said. \u201cI asked OEH to fully investigate the complaint. \u201cOEH determined that the complaint was vexatious and that there were no grounds on which to proceed with any further action.\u201d But NSW Labor\u2019s acting leader, Penny Sharpe, said the phone call was not appropriate. \u201cIt is not acceptable for a government MP to call a government office, identify themselves as an MP in the government, and then seek to influence an active investigation into their own conduct,\u201d she said. \u201cMinister Taylor must immediately explain her conduct.\u201d The NSW OEH said it could not comment on the details of an investigation. Guardian Australia revealed last week that Angus Taylor met senior federal environment officials and Josh Frydenberg\u2019s office in 2017 to discuss the government\u2019s designation of critically endangered grasslands. At the time of the meeting, federal and state investigations were under way into alleged illegal clearing of Monaro grasslands on another property the Taylors hold an interest in near Delegate in NSW. That property is owned by Jam Land Pty Ltd. Angus Taylor\u2019s brother Richard is the director of Jam Land, Angus Taylor himself holds an interest via his family investment company Gufee, and his brother Duncan and sister-in-law Bronwyn also hold an interest via Fairross. Bronwyn Taylor was questioned in the NSW parliament last week about whether she sought to influence the state government\u2019s submissions about the federal decision to upgrade the listing of the grasslands to \u201ccritically endangered\u201d in 2016. The question was ruled out of order because it related to Taylor\u2019s personal actions and not her ministerial responsibilities, so she did not answer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
