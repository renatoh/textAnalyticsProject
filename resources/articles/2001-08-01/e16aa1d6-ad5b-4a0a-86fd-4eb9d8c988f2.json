Ten months after resigning as England coach, Manchester City's 17th manager in 22 years gives the impression that he would much rather block out the whole experience. It is as if that fitful, rain-sodden defeat against Germany never happened. Gareth Southgate playing in midfield? It all seems like a trick of the mind. Keegan does not like talking about England, presumably, for similar reasons to those that make Nick Leeson, City's most infamous supporter, reluctant to talk about Barings Bank. Denial can be a wonderful thing. In fact, the subject of England is now taboo. Earlier this summer Keegan brought together a smattering of local journalists to make it clear he would never speak publicly again about his employment under the Football Association. He was bargaining from a position of strength and he knew it. The national pack, however, has a tendency for bending the rules - or trying to. \"I know you don't want to talk about England, Kevin,\" one cheerily piped up at Keegan's news conference on Thursday. \"But surely it has helped you become a better manager?\" \"You're right,\" he said, deadpan and visibly stiffening in his chair. \"I don't want to talk about England.\" The conversation was finished. Today, as the Nationwide League rumbles into action, he wants to look forward rather than back. But it is clear that the 50-year-old carries emotional scars. He may not be willing to admit it but this is a much different character from the effervescent Keegan of yesteryear. Understandably, perhaps, he cannot forget the vitriol spewed in his direction from some quarters in the wake of his England stewardship. He is guarded, pensive, suspicious, almost prickly. Above all, he resents the media's part in his metamorphosis from people's favourite to national failure. \"People say I went into hiding for three weeks,\" he says, referring to the immediate period after his England denouement. \"What they maybe didn't realise was that I had photographers camped outside my house all that time. I wasn't in hiding, it was just hard to leave the house.\" Warming to the theme, he complains of just having been \"stitched up\" by a Sunday newspaper. \"The problem with the press these days is that they leave out the facts to make a good story,\" he says. \"I remember people said we didn't have a clue defensively at Newcastle. Well, the year we finished second to Manchester United we had the second-best defensive record in the country. Where's the logic there? \"Now the favourite thing to write about me seems to be that I have never won any major honours as a manager. By that criterion there are an awful lot of managers out there who cannot be worth their salt. George Burley has never won anything but he's a good manager. David O'Leary has never won anything but he's a good manager. \"At Newcastle I took them from second bottom of the old Second Division to the fringe of winning the Premiership. If they had been relegated in that first year they would have folded. I had 14 games to save them and I didn't know a single player. Sir John Hall's words were straightforward: 'If we go down, we're finished.' I'm not one for looking back but you can't argue with what happened at Newcastle.\" Getting on with the media helps, of course, but not as much as good results. And that is how Keegan will be judged, starting off this evening when Gianluca Vialli, another manager with something to prove, arrives with Watford. The mission statement, handed down by the City chairman David Bernstein, is to win promotion at the first attempt and then restore some top-flight stability, not least some dignity, to a club that has become a byword for under-achievement. \"The chairman made it clear at our first meeting. He told me straight: 'I want us to be a top-six Premiership club within five years.' Fantasy is one thing and reality is another, but everything he said to me made sense. It will be tough but, given time, we can be in that top six. We can be challenging for the title. \"Everything is achievable. I've had letters from fans giving me a million different reasons why this club has had its problems but it's no good looking back all the time. What's more exciting is looking forward. What's gone has gone.\" Keegan can never be accused of lacking enthusiasm and this is a brave new world, both for him and for City. \"I can hardly wait. It's been a long time and, yes, maybe I have something to prove. \"Sometimes a little bit of rejection and failure can help. All my life I have been proving people wrong. I can remember being turned down at Doncaster as a kid because they said I was too small and then going to Coventry and being rejected there. To be successful you can't always be top dog. It's about how you bounce back.\" And so to the future. City are the bookmakers' favourites for promotion and Keegan will have the fan base (season ticket sales having reached a record 24,000 and every game expected to be a 34,000 sell-out), the finances and, in a couple of years, a new 50,000-capacity stadium to help rebuild this tired, emotive old club. Yet seasoned City-watchers will know better than to underestimate Maine Road's genetic programming for failure. Above all, Keegan must eradicate the political infighting, petty bickering and destructive influences that have been a feature of City life for nigh on 30 years. He must bring the feelgood factor back to Maine Road, scene of 12 home defeats in the Premiership last season. And last but not least, he must tackle the players' refuelling habits that led to claims of a fags-and-booze culture under Joe Royle. Steps have already been taken, even if Keegan is loath to confess as much. According to one player, they have been told they can still have the traditional post-match drinks but alcohol is now forbidden for anyone with an injury. Dennis Tueart, whose directorial influence was pivotal in enticing Keegan to Maine Road, visited one first-teamer earlier this summer to make it clear the club would not tolerate a lack of professionalism. It is a new era. \"I've told the players I don't care what has happened in the past,\" says Keegan. \"All I can say is that since I have been here their attitude has been absolutely first-class. Everyone is up for getting us back in the Premiership.\" So welcome back, Kevin Keegan. It has been a long time. Jack Charlton once said that, if Keegan fell into the Tyne, he would come up with a salmon in his mouth. That was before England, of course, when Keegan dipped his toes into uncharted waters and caught a cold. Now it is time to bury the past. And City will drink to that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
