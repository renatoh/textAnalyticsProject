Would anyone remember the title of the debate until the end? Only really John Micklethwait, US editor of debate sponsors The Economist; the others, Mark Leonard (a Blairite policy wonk), ex-deputy Labour leader Roy Hattersley and writer Christopher Hitchens are soon frying other fish. For Hitchens, it's the chance of a couple of cheap swipes in his current public war of words with George Galloway. He does a similar line in theatrical rhetoric but without the flair. When one of the audience takes issue with Hitchens' claim tonight that fissile material is safest in Tennessee, he simply denounces him as a Galloway supporter, and concludes, \"Well, fuck you.\" It's hardly reasoned argument. But then there are only men on the platform, swinging their balls. In the end, Roy Hattersley rouses himself from his familiar pose of angled slouching, a bored finger digging deep into his cheeks, splutters into life and probably edges the debate, such as it is. History will condemn Bush and Blair for their cynicism, he says - \"I've lost count of the reasons that the prime minister has given for going to war\" \u2013 and dismisses Hitchens' \"Clint Eastwood\" view of the world. Hitchens is apparently employing the Denis Healey defence, says Hattersley: \"When in a weak place, quote a lot of names and places.\" To leave such an event thinking that Roy Hattersley is by far the most pithy, concise and entertaining speaker can't be a good sign. All pretty unedifying. Motion passed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
