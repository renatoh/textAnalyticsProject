Danish company DFDS, which runs a service between Dover and Dunkirk, wants the Maritime and Coastguard Agency to oversee swims instead of the Channel Swimming and Piloting Federation and the Channel Swimming Association. \"We are concerned these crossings are unregulated and growing at an expedient rate. We would like to see it regulated by the MCA,\" said DFDS passenger director Chris Newey. The company's concerns will be echoed by Deputy director of the French Coastguard Jean-Christophe Burving in a BBC documentary tomorrow, Inside Out South East, in which he calls for the swimming route to be banned entirely, according to the BBC. France stopped attempts starting from their coast 17 years ago but allow British swims of the 21 miles, the shortest point separating the two countries to land, known as La Manche. But Dr Julie Bradshaw, secretary of the Channel Swimming Association, said she feared that tighter regulations would not deter swimmers wishing to cross the channel. She told the Guardian: \"I suspect that people determined to do it would swim across without registering with the coast guards and its is that scenario which would be dangerous.\" Dr Bradshaw, who has raised thousands of pounds for charities by swimming across the Channel on numerous occasions, added that the CSA had been in contact with the French Coastguard and said that its comments in the documentary had been misunderstood. \"I'm of the understanding that the French Coastguard did not say it wanted a ban on cross-channel swims, but rather on unauthorised swims, which would be quite right.\" Swimmer Anne Macalpine-Leny, who raised \u00a350,000 for an Afghan maternity ward, called the proposal \"way over the top\". She said swimmers were seen as an \"inconvenience\".She said: \"I'm shocked at the suggestion, the proposal goes too far. \"My guess is that they proposed it because channel crossing swimmers are something of an inconvenience to them. \"Our pilots are second to none, the health and safety measure all swimmers have to take is rigourous, and there are no accidents, so I don't know what this proposal is based on.\" Spokeswomen for charities Oxfam and Unicef both said that it encourages any person who wants to cross the channel in aid of charity and called the proposal \"a shame.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
