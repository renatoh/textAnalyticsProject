But if the first episode of Faster, Higher, Stronger (BBC2) about the men's 100 metres is a sign of what the BBC has planned for the next two and a half weeks before the London 2012 opening ceremony, then I may have to reconsider. To be fair, the newsreel and TV clips from past games remained as mesmeric as ever, though I increasingly found myself being drawn to the peripheral details, such as the empty seats at the Mexico 1968 games; the problem was the gaping hole in the programme's story-line. It should be impossible to make a documentary about the blue riband of the sprints without mentioning the use of illegal drugs, but this film just about managed it. Anyone with little knowledge of sport would have come away thinking that Ben Johnson was a lone rogue athlete; what didn't get mentioned was that the Seoul Olympic final in 1988 was probably the dirtiest race ever, with several of the runners \u2013 including Linford Christie, who went on to win gold in Barcelona at the age of 32 (geriatric, in sprinter's years) \u2013 subsequently being found guilty of taking banned substances. Nor did drugs suddenly become an issue in 1988: they had been an ever-present shadow over sprinting since the 1970s. Many East European athletes were suspected of systematic cheating and Britain's very own 1970s 400m golden boy, David Jenkins, later admitted to taking steroids throughout his career. Johnson's real crime was to be stupid enough to be caught. Cheating isn't some incidental participant in the story of the 100m: it's been the invisible presence on the starting blocks of every major 100m final for the past 40 years. It's tainted every sprinter, regardless of whether or not they are clean, because there can't not now be question marks over everyone's performance. The cheats have ruined the event for everyone and, much as the BBC might want to present the Olympics as the platonic form of the noble and pure, they can't avoid that reality. So to then mention Dwain Chambers, one of the most controversial selections for the 2012 games, missing out on a medal at a previous games by dipping too early at the line without referring to his drug ban was just perverse. Or idiotic. This apart, there was some interesting analysis, breaking the event down into its different components \u2013 though there was nothing I hadn't heard Steve Cram, David Coleman or Ron Pickering say dozens of times before on commentary \u2013 and US athlete turned commentator Michael Johnson is always good value as a talking head. Though to hear him \u2013 the athlete whose own upright style broke all running conventions \u2013 going on about the importance of maintaining style and form was a bit rich. There again, what I ended up really learning about the event was that if you're Bob Hayes or Usain Bolt and are so much better than all your rivals, then you can run the race any way you please. I'm not sure I was much the wiser either about How to Live Beyond 100 (BBC1) despite the promise of the title. The programme itself \u2013 part of the When I'm 65 season \u2013 was jolly enough and the centenarians themselves were all very charming, but as a guide to carving myself out another 45 years of existence, it wasn't much help. Nina's secret was to swim for an hour every morning; Hetty's was to be a peace campaigner; Harry's was to run the resident's association; Nora's was to be involved in the community; Alice's was to play the piano; Ron's was to play a little golf. I suppose there was a general theme of keeping the body and mind active, but that did rather presuppose you have a choice in the matter. The hard part seems to me to avoid having a stroke, getting cancer, suffering from dementia or getting on the wrong aeroplane first. More and more people are making it to 100 so it can't purely be a matter of luck, but beyond a few casual mentions of \"good genes\", this film didn't really explore what that might be. An opportunity missed. Most depressing, from my point of view, was that all the centenarians on show were so chipper, even when they were being patronised/congratulated for their brilliance in not having stopped breathing. Surely there must be a grumpy one somewhere. I hope so. If not, I've got no chance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
