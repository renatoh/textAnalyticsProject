James Milner, Joe Hart and Gary Cahill, who captained the side in Friday\u2019s victory over Estonia, have all been released, while Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick are injured and ruled out of the trip. Jack Butland will make his competitive debut in goal, Jonjo Shelvey will anchor midfield and Hodgson intends to partner Phil Jagielka, who will most likely wear the armband, with Chris Smalling in defence and offer Phil Jones an opportunity at right-back. \u201cGary Cahill has, to some extent, been suffering from occasional back problems and we were a bit concerned with the flight, and the artificial pitch in Lithuania, so, in a straight choice between taking him or Chris Smalling, I went with Smalling,\u201d said Hodgson. \u201cJoe Hart is being left behind \u2018against his will\u2019 because I want to see Jack Butland in goal. And I want to play Jonjo Shelvey in this game. James Milner, if anyone, deserves a rest because he\u2019s played so many games for Liverpool this season, taking on the captaincy. The rest will do him good and it\u2019s the right moment for Jonjo to show what he can do again.\u201d There should be further game time, too, for Jamie Vardy and Dele Alli, who made his debut with a late cameo in the success over Estonia, while Danny Ings may also make his first appearance for the senior side. Carrick had failed a fitness test on a groin problem on Friday morning to prompt his release back to Manchester United, the sixth time the 34-year-old has withdrawn from a Hodgson squad. \u201cHe still felt it when he opened up his leg to sidefoot passes, so he couldn\u2019t have played,\u201d said Hodgson. \u201cWhether it would have cleared up for Lithuania, I suppose that\u2019s open to debate but we have other players I need to see in that game. From his point of view, and United\u2019s, the rest will do him good. I fully expect to see him and Wayne Rooney fit for United and Louis van Gaal next weekend.\u201d England had to demonstrate \u201cpatience and persistence\u201d to unlock Estonia at Wembley and their performance was illuminated by Ross Barkley. The 21-year-old conjured one glorious pass to set up Theo Walcott\u2019s opener and used his opportunity on the left of a midfield three to unpick the visitors\u2019 attempts at resistance. \u201cWe saw what he can do today,\u201d added Hodgson, who has been critical in the past of the youngster\u2019s distribution. \u201cWe had to try and get in amongst them, try to take the ball through them and into them, and Ross did that. I, like all his managers, had to work hard on his decision-making as to when he struts his stuff, which is fantastic, and when he plays it more simply. But that\u2019s a coach\u2019s job with a very talented young player with lots of ability. It\u2019s about getting him to use that ability in the right moments. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sink in overnight. He works at it. I\u2019m sure Roberto [Mart\u00ednez] is working with him, talking to him and giving him the same instructions. He\u2019s learning the lessons not least by playing at the highest level with Everton and England. But I\u2019m quite proud of the fact Ross Barkley is still only 21 but has been in the national team for over two years when he\u2019s quite often not been in the Everton team. That shows the faith I have in him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
