In the 41st minute of this West Midlands derby, Neves demonstrated the value of that fine-tuning by firing the ball into the net from over 20 yards. That gave Wolves a deserved lead and Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez, after thrilling work by Adama Traor\u00e9, struck in the 84th minute to confirm the win that propelled Nuno\u2019s team to eighth in the table despite a stoppage-time goal by Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet. So much for Wolves\u2019 season being undermined by their Europa League exertions. \u201cThis was our 24th match of the season and we have always competed in every one \u2013 that is not easy to do,\u201d said Nuno, praising his team\u2019s consistency in the face of a gruelling schedule. Dean Smith\u2019s mood was much darker. \u201cThat was as bad as I\u2019ve seen us since [a 3-0 defeat at] Wigan away last season,\u201d said the furious Villa manager. \u201cIt almost looked like the match was more important to them than to us. They were right up for it from the start and had more intensity than us.\u201d Wolves\u2019 only defeat in their last dozen games in all competitions was to Villa in the Carabao Cup two weeks ago. A repeat of that never looked likely here, not least because the lineups were radically different. After fielding a youthful side at Villa Park, Nuno made 11 changes and deployed his top guns. They fairly blew away Villa, who, in fairness, were also afflicted by rotten luck. \u201cI\u2019m not using injuries as an excuse because we have a deep squad,\u201d said Smith. Even so, they could have done with Jack Grealish but he had not recovered from calf trouble in time, and centreback Bj\u00f6rn Engels and goalkeeper Tom Heaton were also ruled out, the latter with a calf injury that means Gareth Southgate will have to replace him in the England squad. Ezri Konsa came into defence for his first Premier League start and did well, while goalkeeper Jed Steer made his first top-flight appearance since May 2015. Steer lasted eight minutes, forced off by an achilles injury after backpedalling to try to claw away a cross by Matt Doherty, which ended up bouncing out off the crossbar. Villa had to resort to their third-choice goalkeeper, Orjan Nyland, who has only recently returned from achilles trouble himself. Some teams would have tried to test the new goalkeeper\u2019s mettle by bombarding him with shots pronto. But Wolves rarely deviate from their methodical approach so continued trying to slice and dice their opponents with clever passing and movement. They were dominant, but Nyland did not have a save to make until nearly 20 minutes after his introduction. Diogo Jota\u2019s header was so soft it barely qualified as a test. Wolves continually found space down the wings, especially on the right, where Doherty and Traor\u00e9 thrived. Doherty howled for a penalty after tangling with Matt Targett in the box following a snappy one-two with Jim\u00e9nez. The referee saw nothing wrong. If it had been a penalty, Jim\u00e9nez would have taken it. Nuno confirmed that after seeing Neves\u2019 botched spotkick in the Europa League victory over Slovan Bratislava. Neves evidently followed orders to practise because his goal did not come off the cuff. After Tyrone Mings stopped a trademark Traor\u00e9 charge with a desperate lunge, Jo\u00e3o Moutinho enacted a nifty free-kick routine, playing a disguised pass from wide on the right to Neves at the edge of the D. Neves curled a sumptuous shot into the net. Nyland got fingertips to it but a fat lot of good that did. Villa had been toothless. Now they would have to find some bite and start finding each other with passes. Their luck deteriorated before half-time, as injury to Targett compelled them to make a second substitution. Villa improved after the break but Wolves remained dangerous on the counter-attack. Traor\u00e9 walloped a shot against the bar six minutes into the second period. Traor\u00e9 launched into another devastating run in the 64th minute, leading to a chance for Jota. Nyland did well to tip over his rasping shot from the edge of the box. Moments later Jim\u00e9nez shanked wide after another shot by Jota was deflected into his path. Villa did not work a clear opening until the 54th minute, when Anwar El Ghazi found Wesley in the same spot as Neves had been when he opened to scoring. The Villa striker\u2019s finish bore no comparison, sailing into the jeering hordes in the north bank. Traor\u00e9 was inevitably involved in the goal that ended his former club\u2019s resistance. He skipped past Douglas Luiz down the right before measuring out a cross to Jim\u00e9nez, who slotted into the net from 10 yards. That meant it did not matter that Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet forced the ball over the line in stoppage time after collecting a corner beyond the back post."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
