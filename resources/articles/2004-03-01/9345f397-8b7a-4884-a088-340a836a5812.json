I like to flatter myself it is one that I share. Take, for example, Rudyard Kipling's poem, If. Sports coaches and games teachers have trotted out this verse for generations as if it held some sacred truth. In fact it makes no sense whatsoever. \"If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two impostors just the same . . . \" it counsels. What does that mean? Why are triumph and disaster impostors? Does the poet believe that the only true and genuine result is a draw with a replay a week on Wednesday? And if so, how will the cup competitions ever be resolved? It was just this kind of fresh and incisive wittering that Sir Clive Woodward was looking for when he called me just hours after England's surprise defeat by Ireland. As my regular reader will recall (by the way, will you remember to book the babysitter for Thursday because it's parent-teacher consultation? Thanks) I helped Woody extensively with England's World Cup preparation by skilfully motivating the team with a series of half-baked gags, which they then went out on the park intent on ramming back down my throat. I don't like to claim the credit but I think if it hadn't been for my constant references to Matt Dawson's vague resemblance to the TV magician Paul Daniels, we'd never have come back against Wales. \"I want to innovate, not masticate,\" Woody said breathlessly. \"We need to be holistic not ballistic. Success is 1% inspiration and 99% urination. Achievement is the product of many vowels and consonants arranged in the correct order . . .\" I saw right away what the problem was. Woody had gone to the well of inspirational management gobbledygook and hauled up an empty pail. That was why he was calling. Like most writers I am adept at slogan making. The wall above my desk is covered with motivational messages to myself. When I look at them they swell my spirit with all the sloth, sloppiness and callow cynicism necessary to do my job to the absolute minimum. \"Never put off till tomorrow what you can put off till the week after next\"; \"Today is the first day of the rest of Sepp Blatter's life\"; \"A bad workman blames the workman who did the job last time\"; \"Victory has many parents, defeat is an author\" and that sort of thing. It wasn't just as simple as knocking out a few testosterone-charged aphorisms, however. As I said to Woody, \"We need to solve and resolve before we can evolve\". (Incidentally, a number of people have pointed out to me that Sir Clive's nose always looks wet. This is true. It is nothing to be alarmed about, however. A cold, wet nose is a sign of health in a rugby coach. It's if it's hot and dry that you have to reach for the worming tablets.) For England's rugby team the past few years have been like the Dutch prog rock scene in 1972. It's just been focus, focus and more focus. It was plain to me that this was Woody's problem. Because, as everyone knows, if you focus on something for too long you tend to go cross-eyed. This is exactly what happened to some of England's players in the game against Ireland. It would be wrong to single anyone out in particular, but let's just say that the lineout throwing was definitely that of a man staring in two directions at once. Thanks to my advice, there is going to be a change of policy. What England will be doing in future is staring at their goal with as much concentration as ever, but will be doing so through specially prepared glasses that have been smeared with Vaseline. In other words, they will be soft-focusing. \"What we're looking for,\" I explained to the squad earlier this week, \"is a kind of misty, Franco Zeffirelli quality, the sort of intense yet woozy look of two lovers gazing into one another's eyes after they have just enjoyed their first passionate kiss.\" \"Is it all right if we just pretend we're pissed?\" asked Danny Grewcock. Out, too, at my instruction, went that whole misguided M People \"Search for the Hero Inside Yourself\" nonsense. \"What kind of hero do you have to go searching for?\" I asked Woody. \"Let's face it - if he's such a big hero, how come when the trouble starts he's ducking away under the pancreas, or skulking around in the inner ear hoping you don't notice him? \"Better a coward in the open than a saviour behind the sofa,\" I said. And I am proud to announce that those words, written in magic marker, will be the last thing Larry Dallaglio and the guys see today as they run out of the dressing room at Twickenham."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
