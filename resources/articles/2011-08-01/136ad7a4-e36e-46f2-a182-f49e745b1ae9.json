Boris Johnson and the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, will announce the funding in a visit to a Tottenham pub close to where the riots started. The money, the figure for which has yet to be disclosed, will be used to help promote economic growth and the start of new businesses but will initially only be available in the worst-affected London neighbourhoods. The announcement will coincide with the unveiling of the latest step in the government's wider growth plans, with the naming of 11 more local enterprise zones across which will be able to provide tax breaks, planning concessions and super-fast broadband to encourage the diversification of industry. The zones are a central plank of the coalition's growth strategy. The riots in London last week were focused in some of the most-deprived areas of the capital as well as in inner-city areas in the north and Bristol. Tottenham, Hackney and Ealing, which saw the worst outbreaks of violence, have high unemployment rates. A Treasury source said the money would provide \"more immediate help to areas like Tottenham and Croydon\". Pickles described the 11 zones as \"low tax, low regulation\" and designed to drive private sector growth. Osborne said they would create 50,000 jobs by 2015, diversifying local economies. He said: \"It is vital that we create balanced economic growth across the country. For too long there has been an over-reliance on the City and it is time for us to help every part of the country to grow and realise its potential.\" The 11 areas include Newquay, Northampton, Hereford and Sandwich. They were awarded funds based on bids received from local enterprise partnerships, representing interested parties in the regions. Nine of the new zones will be in the constituencies of coalition MPs and only two are Labour."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
