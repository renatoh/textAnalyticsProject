New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, compared the experience to eBay; Connecticut\u2019s governor, Ned Lamont, said it was like Uber surge pricing, except \u201cat the last moment, the car drives away because somebody has outbid you\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s right, governors are comparing buying life-saving ventilators for a pandemic to surge pricing,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cThis is capitalism at its absolute worst. While Trump waits for the market to decide, people are literally going to die, and states are getting ripped off like they\u2019re trying to call an Uber in the rain in midtown after a Broadway show. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll never guess who\u2019s in charge of this shitshow,\u201d Meyers continued. \u201cThe guy Slenderman has nightmares about: Jared Kushner.\u201d Kushner reportedly pushed back on Cuomo\u2019s request for 30,000 ventilators; he called Cuomo an alarmist and said in a White House meeting: \u201cI have all this data about ICU capacity. I\u2019m doing my own projections, and I\u2019ve gotten a lot smarter about this. New York doesn\u2019t need all the ventilators.\u201d \u201cOh, you\u2019re doing your own projections? Did your parents just buy you a TI-84 [graphing calculator]?\u201d Meyers retorted. \u201cYou\u2019re not qualified to do anything, let alone tell New York how many ventilators they need. You\u2019re a nepotism case, and you only got the White House job because you married into the family, and because the security guards believed your fake ID. \u201cI hope when the time for accountability comes, we can all remember that it didn\u2019t have to be like this,\u201d Meyers concluded, noting that countries such as South Korea and Iceland have contained their coronavirus outbreaks better than the US. \u201cOther countries responded to this pandemic with competence, and they avoided the worst. Now, we\u2019re bracing for an unimaginable tragedy and as we speak, the president is leaving besieged states and hospitals to fend for themselves, putting lives at risk.\u201d Stephen Colbert On A Late Show, Stephen Colbert noted that \u201cevery member of my family has been terrific\u201d on his first week of home-produced TV (including his affable spaniel, Benny) \u201cwhich statistically means I\u2019m the bad roommate. But what are we going to do? We have no choice. Right now, inside is the place to be, because the news from the outside is alarming.\u201d The government this week predicted a coronavirus death toll of between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans. \u201cThat\u2019s why it is so important that everyone stay safe, stay focused and stay inside. \u201cAnd I know you, the American people, get it,\u201d Colbert continued, \u201cbut some of our elected officials are slow on the uptake.\u201d Republican governors in 11 states have still refused to issue stay-at-home orders. \u201cThey\u2019re defiant to the end,\u201d Colbert said, though some are coming around, such as Florida\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, who finally ordered people home on Thursday, citing the president\u2019s \u201cdemeanor the last couple days\u201d. \u201cSo it wasn\u2019t the data, or the scientists \u2013 it was Trump\u2019s demeanor,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cHow does that work? Is he the coronavirus groundhog?\u201d Meanwhile, Georgia\u2019s governor, Brian Kemp, started taking things seriously because \u201cwe didn\u2019t know until yesterday\u201d that asymptomatic people can spread the virus (it\u2019s been widely known for months). \u201cYou didn\u2019t know that until yesterday? It\u2019s all anyone\u2019s been talking about since January!\u201d Colbert exclaimed. \u201cYou\u2019re like a guy saying: \u2018You know, I finally started watching this Game of Thrones. No one told me there were dragons in it! This is a game-changer.\u2019\u201d Trevor Noah And on the Daily Social Distancing Show, Trevor Noah discussed the breakout media figure of America\u2019s pandemic, Dr Anthony Fauci, \u201cthe man whose calm leadership during this crisis has won him the respect of all intelligent people and President Trump\u201d, said Noah. Fauci has reportedly been assigned a security detail due to conspiracy-related threats. \u201cNow, unfortunately, getting threats is fairly standard for anyone in the public eye,\u201d said Noah. \u201cBut what\u2019s not standard is that Dr Fauci is also receiving lots of \u2018unwelcome communications from fervent admirers\u2019. Yes, that\u2019s a nice way to say that your groupies are crazy. And who would\u2019ve thought one day we\u2019d be living in a world where the whole planet would be grounded, and an epidemiologist would be the hottest man on earth. \u201cPeople are just like: \u2018I gotta get me some of that Fauci. You know he got that vaccine, girl,\u2019\u201d Noah continued. \u201cWho\u2019s sexier than Fauci? No one\u2019s sexier. If People magazine doesn\u2019t put him on the cover, they\u2019re wasting their lives.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
