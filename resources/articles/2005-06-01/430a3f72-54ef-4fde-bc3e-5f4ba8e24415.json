Though there is indeed strong interest from Barcelona and Gallas has stated his desire to play in central defence, Chelsea have denied he will move to Camp Nou. \"Gallas is integral to the manager's plans,\" a club spokesman said yesterday. It is understood that Chelsea's chief executive Peter Kenyon met the Barcelona president Joan Laporta last week, though Chelsea refused to confirm the meeting and denied that it had happened on Friday, when Kenyon was in Milan with representatives of both San Siro clubs. It is said that Kenyon and Laporta discussed the subject of transfers, with the Chelsea man exploring the possibility of a move for the Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o. With Internazionale stating that there was \"no possibility\" of Chelsea signing their highly coveted Brazilian Adriano, it is believed that Eto'o, the second-top scorer in Spain last season, had risen on the list of targets. However, Eto'o has become hugely popular at Barcelona with 24 league goals since his \u00a318m transfer from Real Mallorca, which included a payment to Real Madrid because they had a stake in the 24-year-old. Catalan affection for him grew after his \"Madrid: cabr\u00f3n\" (\"bastard Madrid\") outburst after Barcelona won the title and Laporta is aware that selling a man second only to Ronaldinho in the crowd's hearts would be politically troublesome. Chelsea, despite paying \u00a324m for Didier Drogba last summer, are not willing to pay top-end fees for players without proven records and decided not to test Barcelona's not-for-sale stance over Eto'o. Another club who may thwart Chelsea's plans are Lyon. G\u00e9rard Houllier recently took over as manager of the French champions after the departure of Paul Le Guen and his first act was to praise Micha\u00ebl Essien. The Ghanaian, subject of an earlier \u00a310m bid from Chelsea, has been voted France's player of the year and Lyon yesterday confirmed that he had signed a contract extension to 2009."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
