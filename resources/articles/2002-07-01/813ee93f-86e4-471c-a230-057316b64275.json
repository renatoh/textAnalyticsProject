Pod can't say he's been there and done that (they didn't either, come to think of it) but he knows what it's like to be a disappointed parent. One look at next winter's academy squad will tell you the name Podmore doesn't feature in Rod Marsh's plans. Sure, it's only a provisional list and anyone doing anything half useful like managing to stay upright in the next month could easily get the nod. But that doesn't disguise the fact that Dave Podmore Junior has failed big style to live up to the expectations of his doting dad (Dave Podmore Senior). Obviously I've apologised to my old man and he understands. But I feel the hurt just as keenly when it comes to my own lad, also called Dave Podmore, who's carrying on the name but not the family profession of putting it in the right areas and nudging a few at the death. He can't say he hasn't had all the opportunities. As the son of a celebrity sportsperson young Dave was fast-tracked, just like Stewie and Butch, into the Under-12s county set-up. He had a sponsored scooter, free smokes from the day he was old enough to hold a fag in his hands and on his 13th birthday I presented him with his first after-dinner speech, packed with sure-fire gags about Pakistanis in sex shops. I should have seen the danger signs when he showed no interest in having driving lessons from me on Sunday mornings around the disused airfield at Finningley. You can get up to 90 on the grass with no problem - unless you're holding a cup of coffee, of course. But it seemed that instead of discovering what it is to be a man, Dave would rather listen to The Archers. What really broke my heart was his trial for Derbyshire. It was the legendary Ted Crapp who was giving the lads the once-over in the nets that day. Afterwards dear old Ted took the boys to the pub to wet their whistles and what does Dave Junior do? Orders a spritzer and opens a bag of crisps sideways to share them round the table. At that moment I ceased to regard him as my son. Actually I'd left his mother (Nikki) by then so I didn't have a lot of contact with him anyway. Apparently he's got a girlfriend now but I've yet to meet her. And I'm in London at least twice a season - he could have brought her to Uxbridge, but no. Dave's only young so there's enough time for him to turn it round and force his way into the academy squad. But he's got to decide what he wants - a job for life in cricket, or a job for not very much longer making his short films for Channel 4. I saw one of them once, flipping through in the middle of the night. Bloody hell. Mind you, that Tilda Swinton's a right sort. He's welcome to bring her to Uxbridge any day of the week. The Podmore dynasty has been very much uppermost in Pod's mind lately because Jacqui's getting broody. She's seen all the attention Posh and Liz Hurley have been getting for their sprogs; the features in Bella, OK, the Daily Telegraph and what-have-you. So she thinks it's a good career move as well as a cool fashion accessory, but as my bitter experience should tell her, parenting can go pear-shaped. Jacqui insists she wants a little girl. Pod's got no problem with that in theory - corporate hospitality is a noble calling for a good-looking lass. But who's to say she won't get funny ideas in her head and want to go to college - the kind that doesn't have catering or personal grooming on the syllabus? I keep telling Jacqui, you can't legislate for what you're going to get babywise. In the daughter arena, the worst-case scenario would be if little miss Dave (and there's going to be trouble about that, too) turned out to be a lady cricketer. From what I hear, you get paid piss by the ECB, the outfit's rubbish and you get flattened every time you step on the park by some Aussie screw from Cell Block H. And if you so much as dare to take the smallest two-week holiday in Tenerife in the midst of your World Cup preparations, you're dropped from the squad and told to naff off back to your jobs in the social security office. I'm sorry but that is not a world into which Dave Podmore wishes to bring a child. Finally, apologies for last week's suggestion that Darren Gough was going to win us the World Cup. I did of course mean Ronnie Irani. Or Corky. Or who's that bloke from Glamorgan who's supposed to be quick?
