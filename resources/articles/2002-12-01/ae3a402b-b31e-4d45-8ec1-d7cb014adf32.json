HSBC, which I use to check my bank statements and also to check shares, and Scrum.com, because I play rugby for Hove. Boysstuff.co.uk is great for gadgets and gifts. I recently bought a breathalyser kit from there. And of course O2.co.uk. Last online purchase? I bought my wife some undies from the Agent Provocateur website. I also downloaded my son a Thierry Henry voicemail and a One-Nil to the Arsenal ringtone from Arsenal.com. Ever been in a chat room? I've got diverticulitis and there's a special site, with a chat room. It's a pretty medical site. Most recent technological faux pas? I sent someone a picture message of me with a voiceover of me saying \"I love you\". I meant to send it to my wife. Main news source on the web? Ft.com and skysports.com - I check them every day. Most useful website? O2.co.uk - just because I send lots of messages. Least useful website? Askjeeves.com - he's oversponsored, and you never find what you want. And greenfingers.com, because I hate gardening. Do you use a screensaver? I do actually, it's one from Agent Provocateur. Before that it was a Porsche. Most irritating thing about the internet? It's not quick enough - especially in the afternoon when America wakes up. And there are too many sites. And too much waffle. What type of online business is least likely to succeed? Those which forget what the internet's about - they're revenue-focused, not customer-focused. There's too much drivel, or it's under construction - there's nothing more irritating than that. Do you still bother with old media? Yes. I'm a commuter, so I read a lot on the train in the morning. I get the Times and the Sun - one you can read in 10 minutes, and one gives you financial information. I'm also a big fan of Sunday newspapers - lighting a big fire and becoming a couch potato for the afternoon, reading everything from the Sunday Times to the News of the World. Laurence Alexander is MD of Online O2.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
