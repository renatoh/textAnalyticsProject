The CBI said shops were exploiting the pickup in activity to widen depressed profit margins. Fears that inflation would undershoot its 2.5% target have led the Bank's monetary policy committee to cut rates three times this year, but it is expected to leave them at 5.25% at their monthly meeting today. Higher year-on-year sales were reported by 56% of retailers in May, with grocers and shoe shops seeing some of the biggest rises in demand, according to the CBI's survey. Only 21% said sales were lower. Service sector firms also saw a turn-around last month, as they shrugged off the impact of foot and mouth. A survey for the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply showed growth in new business for hotel and catering firms. The sector as a whole showed stronger growth than in April."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
