Many of those watching the likes of Phil Tufnell, Toyah Willcox and John Fashanu in I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here! may have found themselves becoming particularly interested in one of the personalities on the show. New research shows that one in three people in Britain suffers from celebrity worship syndrome after becoming obsessed with their idol. While such dedication can be a positive influence, extreme cases of it see people admitting that they would lie, steal or worse if asked to do so by the object of their admiration. In conjunction with US psychologists Lynn McCutcheon and James Houran, I conducted research, interviewing around 700 people aged between 18 and 60, and concluded that celebrity worship syndrome could affect up to 25% of the population. The findings, published in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, show that celebrity worship is not just the remit of teenage girls or science fiction fans, and can be split up into three different stages. At a low level, it involves following a celebrity for entertainment or social reasons, talking about them with friends and finding out a star's life story. It suggests that fans are attracted to a celebrity because of their perceived ability to entertain and capture the attention. By contrast, at an intermediate level the syndrome is characterised by intense and personal feelings. This form of celebrity worship, which affected around 10% of those surveyed, is thought to reflect a person's belief that he or she may have a special relationship with a star. Emotions such as considering a favourite celebrity to be a soulmate arguably reflect compulsive feelings about the star in question. At its most extreme - a borderline pathological level - celebrity worship affected just under 1% of those surveyed. Indicated by emotions including willingness to spend several thousand pounds on an item, such as a napkin or paper plate, used by a celebrity, it is thought to reflect social-pathological attitudes and behaviours held as a result of worshipping a star. Those who idolise someone on this level could well be solitary, impulsive and anti-social, while people who follow a celebrity for intense personal reasons are likely to be depressed and anxious. The findings show that those who are fans for entertainment and social reasons are more outgoing, happy and optimistic. Celebrity worship, of course, is not necessarily a bad thing: some stars provide very positive role models. Somebody who follows a successful athlete, for example, could find that their health benefits from showing the same dedication to sport as their idol. As with many other patterns of behaviour, such as eating and drinking, moderation is the key: it is over-indulgence that can present problems. As yet, there are no clear answers to why people can immerse themselves in celebrity worship. Our research suggests that it could be the result of somebody's individual personality, while other theories include the addictive nature of following a celebrity. Age is yet another factor, with young people showing more of an interest in celebrities. However, all this must be considered in the light of the continuing growth of media celebrity coverage, and particularly programmes such as I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here! As Mr Fashanu said throughout his time on that show, it's all about focus. \u00b7 Dr John Maltby is a lecturer in psychology at the University of Leicester"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
