And that\u2019s why I want to take responsibility. Obviously, my performances haven\u2019t been good enough and you can see that with the results we\u2019ve got.\u201d The bruising run, which began with defeat against the US in their World Cup semi-final, left Neville post\u2011match conceding for the first time that England had regressed since France. \u201cThere is no hiding from that fact,\u201d he had said. At Wembley, England reverted at times to the pragmatic counterattacking football of the Mark Sampson era. Neville said: \u201cOur tactic was to go away from the style of performance we have promoted and play more direct. There were probably more forward balls played down the side today than have ever been played under my tenure. \u201cAs a manager you want to live and die by your beliefs but ultimately the run that we are on means something has to change. Performance levels have to change and it is up to me to find that formula.\u201d Neville pointed to the long process of changing the way the Lionesses\u2019 play, rather than the style of football itself, as the reason for their on-field difficulties. \u201cWe are being punished for mistakes, for the expansiveness of our style, but we need to get better because the mistakes are coming not because of the shape we are in but little technical errors that we are working on all the time. \u201cI am hoping and what we are working on is that the DNA we want to set into the players eventually, at the big occasion, whether at the Olympics, Euro 2021 or the World Cup in 2023, will be embedded.\u201d The \u201cEngland DNA\u201d being injected into national team football at all levels, men\u2019s and women\u2019s, is, according to Neville, \u201cthe right way to play\u201d. He said: \u201cIt is the way Gareth [Southgate] is playing, that I am playing, that the pathway coaches are playing on both sides, it is what we believe in. I do think it is the right way to play football, it is just that we need to get better at it and better at it faster than we are at the moment.\u201d The decision, then, to revert is a strange one. After England\u2019s 2-1 defeat to Brazil at the Riverside Stadium, Neville said: \u201cI still believe in what we are doing and so do the players.\u201d Neville has been unshakable in his insistence that England stick to style. Even when preparing to face the eventual world champions the USA he said: \u201cMy style\u2019s non-negotiable, I\u2019m afraid, I\u2019m a bit stubborn. We\u2019re not going to change our style. We believe it\u2019s the best way to get success.\u201d The risk now is the change in narrative \u2013 a shaking of that belief in the style bringing success \u2013 will leave the players questioning and disinvesting in Neville\u2019s plan. If he does not believe it wholeheartedly, why should they buy in? Beth Mead\u2019s answer to the question of whether England had gone backwards hinted at a need to rewrite the manual a little. \u201cEveryone needs to take ownership of our performances, both individually and as a collective at the moment, and go back to the drawing board.\u201d Whatever Neville does he will do it with the same crop \u2013 wholesale personnel changes are not on the cards \u201cbecause of the depth\u201d. He said: \u201cIf you make five or six changes you have to bring five or six players in, the players below have got to still reach the level required and that is the push now we want to give players who are not in the starting XI. \u201cNow we need to get to where we were before the World Cup. Instead of having six, seven, eight players at a certain level before the World Cup we had 15, 16, 17, now we have dropped in terms of performance levels and we need to get them back up.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
