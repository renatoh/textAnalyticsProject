The 29-year-old Senegal midfielder, who underwent surgery to correct an irregular heartbeat five months ago, was rushed to hospital after collapsing during the warm-up at the Reebok Stadium. He was discharged yesterday morning after spending the night in hospital and undergoing tests. Bolton's manager Sam Allardyce will hold talks with Fadiga and his advisers to ascertain his ability to overcome his heart problems. Fadiga is under contract at Bolton until the end of the season after being handed a chance to rebuild his career by Allardyce two months ago. After making his Bolton debut as a substitute during the 1-0 defeat of Crystal Palace this month the former Internazionale player said he was determined to wipe out any doubts over his fitness. \"I don't want to keep talking about my heart operation. I just want to look to the future at Bolton,\" he said. \"I am ready to play and specialists in the USA, France and Belgium have all said that my heart is fine after the operation.\" The Sao Caetano defender Serginho died after suffering an apparent cardio-respiratory arrest and collapsing on the pitch during a match against Sao Paulo on Wednesday. The match was abandoned after Serginho, who only recently turned 30, was taken to the Sao Luiz hospital early in the second half and died shortly afterwards. The Arsenal midfielder Robert Pires has continued his criticism of the France coach Raymond Domenech after his half-time substitution in the 2-0 World Cup qualifying win in Cyprus this month. \"Nothing in his behaviour allows me to believe that he trusts me. I have the impression I'm still at school, that I'm 20 and I've only just started playing football,\" Pires told the magazine France Football. \"We need Domenech to make us relax and instead he makes us feel tense by his behaviour, his words, his comments.\" Pires claims the situation at Arsenal is radically different because he has such a good relationship with his manager. \"In England I'm lucky to have Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who knows me well and puts me in the best possible conditions to succeed. There's a mutual trust between us that doesn't exist elsewhere; not in the French team in any case.\" Jan Molby yesterday resigned as manager of Kidderminster with the club bottom of League Two after his second spell in charge. His departure followed Tuesday night's 3-0 defeat to Chester, a team managed by his former Liverpool team-mate Ian Rush. Juventus remained unbeaten and opened up a five-point gap over Milan at the top of Serie A last night after beating Roma 2-0 at Stadio Delle Alpi with goals from Alessandro Del Piero and Marcelo Zalayeta."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
