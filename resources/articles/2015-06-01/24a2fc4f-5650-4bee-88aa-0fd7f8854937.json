The rules also give broadband providers the certainty and economic incentive to build fast and competitive broadband networks.\u201d The fight for an open internet is far from over, however. \u201cI plan to fight the order all the way to the supreme court,\u201d said Daniel Berninger, founder of the Voice Communication Exchange. At the end of February, the FCC approved a 313-page order that would allow it to treat internet access like a public utility. Cable and telecommunication companies objected, saying the order was an overreach by the FCC and that such rules should be created by Congress. By mid-April, a handful of lawsuits had been filed against the FCC, seeking to overturn the net neutrality rules. The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) filed one such suit; so did the National Cable and Telecommunications Association (NCTA) and the US Telecom and the American Cable Association. \u201cI am pleased that the FCC\u2019s Open Internet Order and strong rules to ensure there are no slow lanes on the internet become effective tomorrow,\u201d said Mignon Clyburn, a FCC commissioner, on Thursday. \u201cA free and open internet is vital to our democracy and competitive market. I am proud to stand up for the consumer to protect free speech and a free market.\u201d Not everyone at the FCC was as thrilled. Ajit Pai, one of the two Republican FCC commissioners who voted against the plan, said he was disappointed with the court\u2019s decisions. He added that the \u201cdevelopment was not unexpected\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
