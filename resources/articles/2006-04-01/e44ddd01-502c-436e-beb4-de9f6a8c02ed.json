Members of the National Union of Teachers voted overwhelmingly in favour of a motion paving the way for ballots which could trigger industrial action in England's 24,000 state schools. Delegates attending the annual conference in Torquay pledged to step up the NUT's fight against the education and inspections bill, which sets out plans to give business and faith groups a bigger role in running state schools. After a debate on an emergency motion during which members accused the government of trying to dismantle the comprehensive education system by giving schools new freedoms they did not need or want, delegates demanded a national publicity campaign to persuade parents to oppose the reforms, and a lobby of parliament. They passed an amendment calling on the union's leadership to \"explore the circumstances under which national industrial action, up to and including national strike action, could be taken to highlight the strength of opposition to the education bill\". At the same time, they threatened strike action on a school-by-school level to oppose the government's city academies programme, which are at the centre of a political row about peerages given to private sponsors."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
