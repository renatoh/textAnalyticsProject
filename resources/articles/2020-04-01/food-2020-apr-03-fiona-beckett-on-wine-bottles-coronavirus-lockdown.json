Normally, it\u2019s second only to Christmas in terms of family get-togethers, but this year, small groups of us will be sitting it out at home, some even on our own, though hopefully not without good food on the table. And wine \u2013 yes, for heaven\u2019s sake, WINE. Even though food and wine matching is my thing, I\u2019m not going to suggest any clever-clever food pairings at this time. Drink whatever wine you enjoy and that makes you feel good. That said, Easter is relatively late this year, so we are firmly into spring, which, to my mind at least, means lighter wines, possibly even ros\u00e9 if you\u2019ve got an outdoor space in which to enjoy it. Personally, I like the exotically lush Pedro Luis Monastrell Ros\u00e9 2019 (\u00a35.99 Aldi, 12.5%), Spain\u2019s version of mourv\u00e8dre, which tastes oddly but deliciously like ripe nectarines. There\u2019s a lot to be said for the comfortingly familiar at such times: grape varieties such as chardonnay and merlot that were popular for a reason but simply fell out of fashion, say; and classic wines such as rioja and red bordeaux, which are both good with lamb. There\u2019s a role for well-known names at these moments, just as the word Heinz on a can of soup or beans offers comforting reassurance. You pay a bit more, but it\u2019s a faithful old friend. Supermarkets, of course, have special offers to tempt you (Waitrose is selling the very decent Terre di Vita Organic Pinot Grigio for \u00a35.99 at the moment), and has taken on new stocks after that dead period between January and March, the wine world\u2019s equivalent of the hungry gap. In addition to the ros\u00e9 above, I was particularly impressed by Aldi\u2019s range at the last tasting I went to before full lockdown. There\u2019s another in my recommendations below. Please also try to support your local shops, producers and small online independent businesses who are finding life desperately hard. If you can buy wine from a local winery (or beer from a local brewery), do it. At the time of writing, some restaurants and wine bars that are unable to trade and have an off-licence are selling direct, while most local wine shops will deliver even if they\u2019ve had to close their doors \u2013 though the situation is constantly changing. If they\u2019re not already offering a delivery service, just ask. Four bottles with a feelgood factor Aldi Exquisite Collection Padthaway Chardonnay 2018 \u00a35.99 , 13.5%. Lush, creamy, comforting: will rub along seductively with anything from roast chicken to fish pie. Fitz sparkling wine \u00a322 or \u00a3120 for a case of six, 12%. Really appealing. Made by the same method as, but less sweet than, prosecco: light, fresh, appley. Cool label, too. Comtesse Saint Hilaire Montagne Saint-Emilion 2018 \u00a310 Co-op, 13.5%. Saint-Emilion is often a disappointment, but this from the next-door appellation is really good value: smooth, ripe and plummy. Cune Vi\u00f1a Real Rioja Crianza 2016 \u00a38.95 Cheers, Swansea 13%. Posh-looking, smart-tasting but surprisingly reasonably priced rioja from a region that\u2019s been badly hit by Covid-19. \u2022 For more by Fiona Beckett, go to matchingfoodandwine.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
