How music has fought pandemics for 2,700 years", "bodyText": "Disease is on the prowl. As residents hide behind locked doors, barely a footstep is heard on Milan\u2019s cobbled streets. A strict quarantine is in effect, and all commerce, trade and public life have vanished. The area around Il Duomo, the city\u2019s ornate cathedral, stands empty. Fearing contagion, all religious gatherings have been banned. But when it comes to their faith \u2013 and, importantly, their music \u2013 nothing can stand in the people\u2019s way. Following a call to \u201cgo to church in spirit\u201d, they launch a collective act of social and musical defiance. Windows are opened, doors unlocked and balconies perched on as thousands of men, women and children start to sing. No, this is not Milan during the coronavirus lockdown. It\u2019s the summer of 1576, and the plague of Saint Charles has devastated much of the Italian north. \u201cIt was a sight to see,\u201d one commentator reported, \u201cwhen all the inhabitants of this populous city, numbering little short of 300,000 souls \u2026 [sent] up together an harmonious voice.\u201d It was such a sight, he wrote, that Milan appeared as \u201cthe heavenly Jerusalem\u201d itself. \u201cJust think, in walking around Milan, one heard nothing but song,\u201d another remarked wistfully. \u201cOne almost wished for these tribulations to last longer.\u201d The parallels to the current pandemic are striking. People in Italy, Spain and the wider world have used music to bring their communities together on a truly impressive scale: videos of balcony concerts \u2013 in which quarantined musicians perform for other nearby residents \u2013 are going viral, and covers of Nessun Dorma, Valerie, Imagine and even a spirited run-through of Lewis Capaldi\u2019s Someone You Loved have emerged. In a poignant echo to the plague of St Charles, one Milanese trumpeter offered his soulful rendition of O Mia Bela Madunina, the city\u2019s hymn to the golden Virgin Mary atop Il Duomo. The UK\u2019s recent Clap for the NHS is another example. In that case, it didn\u2019t matter if you were a musician: pots, pans, hands and shouts were enough. Such gestures of communality offer us much-needed consolation. But in the broader landscape of history, it would be an anomaly if we weren\u2019t playing music in this way. From as early as ancient Egypt, Greece and the Babylonians, music has been a reliable tool for spiritual healing and social bonding for thousands of years amid disease. When plague struck Sparta in the 7th century BC, city leaders petitioned the poet Thaletus to sing hymns, and Terpander, another noted ancient Greek poet, was called up during a plague in Lesbos. Even Pythagoras, the creator of every schoolchild\u2019s favourite theorem, used music as a therapeutic device, playing the lyre to calm drunken hooligans. In medieval Italy, music went far beyond singing from windows, too. Before knowledge of contagion was widespread, the medieval \u201cplague procession\u201d was a recurrent sight on Europe\u2019s streets. Entire towns marched, sang and prayed under icons of local saints, with call-and-response litanies designed to encourage participation. Remi Chiu, a musicologist at Loyola University, finds a parallel in these processions with the \u201cWuhan jiayou!\u201d \u2013 or \u2018Stay strong, Wuhan!\u201d \u2013 chants that took off in January in the Chinese city where the pandemic began and likewise with the appearance of local patriotic songs on Italian balconies. Chiu says music\u2019s ability to overcome our egos is a \u201cvery powerful\u201d tool in a quarantine. \u201cWhen you\u2019re making music, you\u2019re submitting yourself \u2013 your mind, your body \u2013 to its regulation. And when you\u2019re making music communally, or even dancing or doing the Macarena with your neighbours, you\u2019re simultaneously contributing and submitting yourself to the larger goal of the group.\u201d Technology can extend this communality \u2013 through a tweet or Facebook post, what would have become a column inch or a forgotten memory can inspire global solidarity. Religion is playing a far less tangible role today than it did in medieval Italy. While the importance of religion varies from country to country and city to city, that Lewis Capaldi appears at all in our musical response is a significant development. Religion can be a very strong social glue in localised groups, but non-religious music may encounter fewer obstacles in our collective identity politics: if you like C\u00e9line Dion, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re Catholic, Jewish, Protestant or Jedi. Plus, even in the climate of medieval Europe, religious fanatics were known to take things too far. The \u201cflagellants\u201d found the source of disease in their own sinfulness, and responded in kind through vivid displays of violent masochism. With music again as a driving pulse, flagellants would whip their backs with chains and ropes for hours on end, and to the singular horror of most who saw them. Social bonds aren\u2019t the beginning and end of music, either. In our response to the coronavirus, balcony concerts have been just one of a range of musical tools we\u2019ve deployed. Virtual gigs, \u201cpandemic pop\u201d and a corona-themed Bono single have so far appeared, but music\u2019s role can be considerably more basic. So long as we use any kind of music to restore balance and reduce our suffering, we\u2019ll be walking in the footsteps of our forebears. Viewing our minds and bodies as intrinsically connected, medicine since the time of ancient Greece has claimed that maintaining a positive state of mind can offer the conjoining effect of treating physical disease. During the Renaissance, patients were encouraged to compose and study art, joke and laugh with their friends, and also to play music, because the resulting energy would flow favourably to their \u201chumours\u201d: ethereal substances believed to form the building blocks of our constitutions. Indeed, when plague approached England, it\u2019s no coincidence that Henry VIII chose his organ player as one of the five men he quarantined with; Boccaccio\u2019s Decameron, now a classic of historical fiction, describes a circle of Italian aristocrats who retreat from a mainland plague for days of sex, music and drinking. And as Dr Chris Macklin, a former professor of musicology at Mercer University and an authority on plague music, notes in a blog post, the 14th-century composer Guillaume de Machaut was deeply troubled by the Black Death but none of his music referenced it. Why? \u201cMusic is a science which asks that one laugh, and sing, and dance,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt does not care for melancholy, nor for the man who is melancholy.\u201d Talk of \u201chumours\u201d may seem fanciful now, of course. But this is no reason to do away with the music. \u201cMusic is proving to be a true antidote to fear, just as Renaissance doctors claimed,\u201d says Chiu. For patients with schizophrenia, cancer, multiple sclerosis and others \u2013 and even those on ventilators \u2013 music therapy can significantly reduce in anxiety, depression and sometimes the underlying symptoms of disease. Macklin writes that \u201cmusic was not a luxury in times of epidemic uncertainty \u2013 it was a necessity\u201d. Now that we\u2019re equipped with technology, science and a global identity, music may be more valuable \u2013 and more necessary \u2013 than ever."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
