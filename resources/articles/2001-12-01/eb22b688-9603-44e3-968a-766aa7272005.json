The transfer windows will come into force from the start of next season along with a transfer system that will otherwise give players greater freedom of movement. The windows will apply to all international and domestic transfers among the continent's top leagues and will operate from the end of a domestic season to August 31 and in the winter from January 1 to January 31. Uefa's Professional Football Committee, made up of the continent's 11 top leagues - the Premier League plus those in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Netherlands, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland - agreed to introduce the windows in an attempt to harmonise the transfer system and make it more compliant with European labour laws. Uefa's executive committee will now approve the transfer windows system and recommend that it be implemented among the top leagues of its 51 member associations. The windows will also be approved by Premier League chairmen at a meeting later this month, initially only for international transfers. Further discussions will take place on their use for domestic transfers but there is a growing feeling among the 20 chairmen that they should adopt them for these as well to remain consistent with European law. A Premier League statement said last night: \"Up until the intervention of the European Commission we have not considered international transfer windows to be necessary. However, legally we appreciate there was always going to be a need. As regards the introduction of domestic transfer windows, further discussions will be undertaken with our clubs.\" The meeting of the top leagues took place at Uefa's headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. Uefa and the continent's leagues believe transfer windows will bring stability to the game and minimise the effect of agents on players. The windows system will not apply to Football League clubs but they are to discuss the matter to decide whether they should adopt it along with other smaller leagues from around Europe. The Spanish league president Pedro Tomas Marques, head of Uefa's PFC, said yesterday: \"This is an historic agreement, which for the first time should give us harmonised transfer periods in European professional football. We believe this is the right way forward for sporting, legal and financial reasons.\" Uefa said individual leagues, rather than clubs, could apply for certain exemptions, for instance in the case of injured goalkeepers. But it warned that such exemptions should not be used to circumvent transfer-period regulations. The issue of the transfer system has threatened to tear the game apart over the past 18 months after the European Union initially ruled it was against its labour laws and restricted the movement of players. Negotiations between Uefa, Fifa, the EU and players' representatives led to agreement six months ago on a new structure. From the start of next season players will have not only greater freedom of movement but greater rights to break contracts after a minimum period, depending on their age. But the transfer issue is far from resolved. Some in the game fear it might be open to further legal challenge and that the windows could be considered restrictive, meaning further confusion for fans and administrators. Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, which was involved in the discussions, said: \"We are uncomfortable with the windows and we consider them restrictive. Many football league clubs will suffer from not being able to sell players to bigger clubs when they want and that is a vital source of income to them.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
