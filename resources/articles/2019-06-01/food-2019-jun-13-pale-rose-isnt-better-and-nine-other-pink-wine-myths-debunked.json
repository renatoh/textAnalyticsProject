Yet no style gets discriminated against quite like ros\u00e9. It\u2019s all sweet, we\u2019re told, or it\u2019s only for women, or for summer, or for women in summer \u2026 For a long time, ros\u00e9 was disregarded because good winemakers didn\u2019t make it: star California winemaker Rajat Parr, who was a San Francisco sommelier in the 1990s, once said: \u201cNo one cared about it, no one thought about it, no one drank it.\u201d That, thank goodness, has changed \u2013 yet the prejudices remain. So let\u2019s bust a few persistent myths. Ros\u00e9 is a new trend The ancients were probably drinking pink when Julius Caesar was knee-high to a grasshopper. In ancient Greece and Rome, white and red grapes would often have been crushed together, by foot, and the contact of the juice with red grapeskins would have meant that most wine was some version of red. Since the rules of classical civilisation held that all wine must be diluted with water \u2013 only barbarians drank it straight \u2013 a lot of that juice would have wound up a shade of pink. You make ros\u00e9 by blending red and white wine In ancient times, essentially yes, since, as noted, all the grapes were mixed together. These days we do things a little differently. There are two ways to make ros\u00e9 now: the saign\u00e9e method and skin contact. The former involves bleeding off some juice after red grapes have been pressed: that juice becomes a lightly tinted wine, while what is left becomes a more concentrated red. Skin contact, or maceration, involves leaving the juice and its skins and pulp all mulched together for a time (hours, usually) so that some of the flavour and colour from the solid matter seeps into the wine. Ros\u00e9 should be cheap Ros\u00e9 certainly can be cheap, but anyone who has ever drunk vintage pink champagne knows that isn\u2019t always the case. In Provence, Sasha Lichine set out to create a really premium ros\u00e9 and succeeded: he sells millions of bottles of his Whispering Angel, at about \u00a318 each. That\u2019s his budget option: the gorgeous Les Clans won\u2019t leave you much change from \u00a350. Far from being the also-ran option for those without the know-how or the talent to make white or red, ros\u00e9 is \u201cthe most difficult colour I\u2019ve ever had to make good,\u201d says Lichine. Also costing about \u00a318 is Domaine Tempier ros\u00e9, from the prestigious Bandol appellation, which is credited with first showing the world how great ros\u00e9 can be. I have seen Domaine Tempier\u2019s co-founder Lulu Peyraud knock back a glass as if it were water, and she\u2019s 101 and counting. If Bandol ros\u00e9 holds the secret to eternal life, then \u00a318 seems pretty reasonable. The paler the pink, the better the wine Absolutely not. This myth probably arose because the wines of Provence, which range in colour from apricot to salmon, are so admired. And rightly so: when good, they are herbaceous and saline and dangerously drinkable. But colour isn\u2019t an indicator of quality \u2013 in fact, as pale ros\u00e9 has become more popular, some winemakers have prioritised shade to such an extent they have ended up with a kind of alcoholic water. All ros\u00e9 is sweet Ugh, no. You\u2019re probably thinking of Mateus ros\u00e9. Or zinfandel blush. The former is a bubblegum-pink Portuguese wine that was hugely popular in the 1970s and 80s \u2013 around the same time as the Austrians were getting into trouble for sweetening their wine with antifreeze. Anything would taste good after that. Zinfandel blush is an American wine originally made by the Sutter Home winery in California but best known here for the bright pink Blossom Hill version. The best ros\u00e9, such as Chivite\u2019s Las Fincas Rosado, is dry and aromatic and elegant; it goes beautifully with food. It is also rather nice without food. You should only drink it in summer Ros\u00e9 certainly goes well with sunshine \u2013 and the Proven\u00e7al kind makes a marvellous combination with tomato salads, artichokes or other summer delicacies. But I drink ros\u00e9 all year round, and it brings a little summer glint to grey winter days. It\u2019s only for aperitifs There are wondrous ros\u00e9 aperitifs; they are so wondrous you can keep drinking them throughout the meal. The only wine aperitifs that don\u2019t work with food are those, such as muscadet, that are too delicate to compete with any strong flavours. This is not how good ros\u00e9 does business. It\u2019s only for women Anyone who divides the contents of their bar along gender lines deserves to be consigned to drink water for ever. Good ros\u00e9 is for people who like good wine. If you are of legal drinking age and in possession of a couple of tastebuds, it is for you. It\u2019s only made in the south of France Oooh, no. These days, ros\u00e9 is made almost everywhere, from South Africa to Australia, and most countries can thrust forward some good examples, although France makes more \u2013 and more of the best \u2013 than anywhere else. But French ros\u00e9 spreads far beyond Provence. There are ros\u00e9s d\u2019Anjou in the Loire, and wonderful pink pinots (such as those made by Sylvain Pataille as Fleur de Pinot) in Burgundy. One of my all-time favourite ros\u00e9 regions (and it is an appellation, highly unusually, that only applies to ros\u00e9) is Tavel, a delicious, raspberry-coloured (and raspberry-flavoured) wine from the eponymous village in the southern Rh\u00f4ne \u2013 just across the river from Ch\u00e2teauneuf du Pape. (They don\u2019t make ros\u00e9, although one of the most famous CDP producers, the Perrin family, produces the excellent and phenomenally successful Miraval, better known as Brangelina\u2019s wine.) Good tavel is fabulous; mediocre tavel is living off the wine\u2019s centuries of glory, when Louis XIV graced it with his favour and Balzac, the world\u2019s most caffeinated writer, would put down his beloved coffee cup for a glass of it. As recently as last century, the great gourmand AJ Liebling declared it the only ros\u00e9 worth drinking. Try Domaine de la Mordor\u00e9e and you may come to agree with him. It is less complicated than red or white wine I would like to say yes to this one \u2013 but it\u2019s probably, not, no. You can make it from many different grapes, although grenache is the most widely acceptable. You can make it in different ways, as we have seen. You can create a blush style or a rich red, and you can make red grapes in a white wine manner and name it Gris de Gris, as Ksara does in Lebanon, or make a white from your pinot grapes, which will often turn out pink, as Albourne does in West Sussex."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
