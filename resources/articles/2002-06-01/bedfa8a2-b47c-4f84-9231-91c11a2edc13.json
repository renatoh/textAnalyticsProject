Mick McCarthy's Ireland - as opposed to the one until recently under the iron rule of an absent friend - gave the manager a comeback and a draw fashioned out of simple virtues, familiar ones, that will keep them in good heart for Germany in Ibaraki on Wednesday. Another point there and a couple of goals against Saudi Arabia in Yokohama on Tuesday week and the Irish are surely through. To sustain the adventure that long would be an achievement in itself because, whatever the noise created over the past couple of weeks about one man not being bigger than the team. In Ireland's case that old verity patently does not apply. All of which made survival here the more satisfying for McCarthy, given the irreparable rift between himself and the captain he sent packing for taking his perfectionism way past the point of responsible dissent. There is no disguising the fact that defeat would have wounded almost beyond repair a team and a country still confused and divided by the banishment of Roy Keane. When he should have been at the World Cup, at the height of his powers, even on one leg with hip and back pain, too, he hovered over proceedings instead, like a ghost. And for half a game, Ireland played with half a heart. The fans sang, 'Are you watching on the box?' and no doubt, back in Cheshire, he was. What wouldn't you have given to be sitting beside him, watching his blazing eyes, gauging the pain - or the regret. And then would he have been involuntarily lifted from his seat when Matt Holland scored the sweetest of equalisers? He surely would, cursing, perhaps, that it hadn't been his cool snap of a right boot sending the ball skimming low into the small gap between Boukar Alioum's dive and the left post. It was no more than Ireland and the Ipswich Town midfielder deserved. He and Mark Kinsella (two players for the price of one Keane) had been overrun in the first half by the speed and audacity of Samuel Eto'o, especially, and Patrick Mboma, unrecognisable from the striker who sometimes performs for Sunderland. But Ireland regrouped. These were two teams riven in different ways: Ireland by pig-headedness, Cameroon by another threatened strike over pay that meant they arrived five days late. You might have expected the colour and noise to fill Niigata's football palace to the brim, but the respectful Japanese, who formed the bulk of thecrowd, watched in virtual silence, as quiet as a garden. What hubbub there was came from Irish throats and the drums of Cameroon's tiny contingent. The straightbacks had said there would be no political banners allowed, but up went the familiar mix of amusing and naff jokes ('Up The Duff' - I ask you) on green-white-and-gold flags around the top of the dividing tier. There had been concern among the 4,000 or so Ireland fans that tickets bought at home would not materialise and plenty of supporters were still waiting for them on match day. Good to see, anyway, that 'Kerry Girls on Tour' got in. 'Good Girl Sharon' was there, too. Among Cameroon's supporters, a smiling chorus line of girls in tribal kit danced and sang in their seats (you won't see that at Old Trafford), buoyed by sun obviously to their liking. As for the Irish, they were keeping their pale heads down; as one of the two Johns had said in a bar the night before: 'We only come in two colours - white and pink.' Cameroon were dynamic from the start. A sublime back-heel by Mboma, dummying Steve Staunton, left the crowd gasping. Eto'o combined with his fellow striker to torment Ireland's uncertain defence time and again and it was no surprise that they manufactured the opening goal on their own. Eto'o dragged Staunton wide, the stand-in captain overbalanced and fell, Gary Kelly and Kinsella arrived late and Mboma had merely to accept a short pass from Eto'o to slide the ball past Shay Given from five yards. They might have had a couple more and Ireland looked shot. The manner of Ireland's resurgence was impressive because of the depths to which they had sunk. Every player lifted his game, eradicating mistakes, making space and time for others and, above all, refusing to panic. Robbie Keane, who ran all day, missed a free header, Given waved an audacious blast from Marc-Vivien Fo\u00e9 over the bar and the balance began to shift. Rigobert Song headed over, Kevin Kilbane did likewise and it was developing into a jab-for-jab boxing match. Geremi should have scored after dispossessing Ian Harte, a miss that his coach, Winfried Sch\u00e4fer, said cost Cameroon the match. Which is stretching it a bit. The longer Cameroon had to play without the ball in the second half, the more dangerous Ireland looked. The quality of their ball control and decision-making rose appreciably in a mature response to the deficit. When the goal came, it came stylishly. Seizing on a poor headed clear ance by Raymond Kalla, Holland steadied himself 30 yards out, picked his spot and drove the ball over the manicured turf as if parking a car in a space too small for a motorbike. Ireland now played as if they believed they deserved to win. And, had the Japanese referee been better sighted, they would have done. Replays showed that Keane was justified in screaming for hand-ball by Song as he guided a bobbling ball in the goalmouth down to his goalkeeper with his upper arm. Then, 10 minutes from the end, Keane was handed another appalling clearance and rifled back a reply that hit a post. As the Ireland fans filed noisily, joyfully out of The Big Swan, as the pleasingly sculptured ground is called, they at last could look forward to a night of justified celebration. The Great Debate could be put to one side - for a few days, at least. The stats Ireland Cameroon Attempts (on target) 13 (7) 13 (5) Tackling (successful) 25 (21) 21 (15) Passing accuracy 75.2% 78% Ireland Cameroon Fouls 8 15 Corners 8 8 Offsides 1 1 Who needs Keano? Although Cameroon had more possessions (Wome, Lauren, Fo\u00e9 and Olembe completing 121/165 passes compared to Holland, Kilbane, Kinsella and McAteer's 102/122) the Irish midfield made 13 successful tackles from 14 attempts - suffocating Cameroon's attacking play. Spreading it around Seven of Ireland's nine attempts came from defenders or midfielders. Robbie Keane (right) was isolated - he had to drop into midfield to pick up the ball, receiving just 19 passes - only five of them in the final third. Key for Cameroon Samuel Eto'o completed 17 of 22 passes, seven of them in the final third. He made six successful passes to Patrick Mboma, including an assist for the opening goal. Ireland (4-4-2): Given; G Kelly, Breen, Staunton, Harte (Reid 72); McAteer (Finnan 46) Kinsella, Holland, Kilbane; Duff, Robbie Keane. Booked: McAteer, Finnan, Reid. Cameroon (3-5-2): Alioum; Song, Kalla, Tchato; Wome, Lauren, Fo\u00e9, Olembe, Geremi; Eto'o, Mboma (Suffo 68). Booked: Kalla. Referee: T Kamikawa (Japan) - Too diligent. Man of the match: Matt Holland - After a tough time tracking Mboma in the first half, hung in and came to life after the break. Took took his goal with calm assurance when he might have been tempted just to lash in hope. Five-star rating: *** - Cameroon, on top first half, could not match Ireland for energy on and off the ball in the second."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
