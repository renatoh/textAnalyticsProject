Khan is scheduled to fight Barrera at Manchester's MEN Arena on 14 March, with 15,000 tickets already sold, but the fight now appears at risk. Barrera's left eye was cut after a head-butt in the third round by Rojas, who was immediately disqualified. Mexican media reports suggest the cut required stitches \u2013 which may affect Barrera's ability to be ready for the bout against Khan. The former world heavyweight champion Ingemar Johansson, the Swede who won the title in sensational fashion by knocking out Floyd Patterson in 1959, has died in Sweden, aged 76. He died from pneumonia but had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Johansson was the best fighter in Europe at the time he fought for the title in New York. Among those he had defeated were the leading British fighters Joe Bygraves, Henry Cooper and Joe Erskine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
