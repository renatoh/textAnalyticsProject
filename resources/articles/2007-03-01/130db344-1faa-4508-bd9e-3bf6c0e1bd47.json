The Pyrenees did better still, with 35cm arriving. Austria New snow fell on Thursday in Obergurgl, Ischgl and Neustift but the Arlberg resorts received only a light sprinkling. Resorts in central Austria, such as Zell am See and Niederau, are suffering due to high temperatures and rain instead of snow. Switzerland Most resorts got a boost from new snow last week which should be enjoyed to the full today when the foggy weather clears. However warm temperatures mean lower runs are getting slushy in the afternoons. Italy Some big dumps of snow have, finally, fallen, particularly in the Aosta Valley. Cervinia got 28cm of new snow on Wednesday, taking its total depth to more than three metres at the top. US and Canada It's bitterly cold in eastern America at the moment, around -20C, but most resorts around the country have great conditions. There was little new snow in Canada last week, but Whistler is forecasting an astounding 149cm in the next five days! The rest Great conditions in Baqueira Beret in Spain after a 40cm dump, while at least 10cm of new snow fell in Andorra. Fantastic conditions continue in Scandinavia. \u00b7 Data courtesy of the Ski Club of Great Britain"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
