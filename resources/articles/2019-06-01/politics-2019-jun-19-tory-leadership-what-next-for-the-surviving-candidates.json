His well-disciplined campaign team will continue with their strategy of subjecting him to minimal media exposure, though once the field is narrowed down to two, the final pair will appear in more than a dozen head-to-head hustings for Tory members. The team\u2019s main aim is simply to keep heads down and avoid Johnson creating headlines for the wrong reasons. There were widespread rumours at Westminster that Johnson\u2019s team was keen to see the elimination of Dominic Raab, the only candidate whose Brexit stance outflanked that of the former foreign secretary. Johnson\u2019s consigliere, Gavin Williamson, the former defence secretary, who revels in the dark arts of politics, has been exercising the persuasive powers he used as Theresa May\u2019s chief whip. But many colleagues fear that when the campaign is over and Johnson makes it to No 10, some of the pledges he has made along the way, across the spectrum of his party from Steve Baker to Matt Hancock, will quickly unravel. Michael Gove Plucky underdog Rory Stewart hinted on Wednesday morning, before he was knocked out of the race, that he and Gove were considering joining forces. His campaign team subsequently said: \u201cClearly at some point people will need to combine teams. But any team that gets combined, Rory wants to lead.\u201d That never looked plausible, however. Stewart is now likely to endorse the environment secretary \u2013 and hope to take many of his supporters with him. Some had already swapped sides. One told the Guardian they had supported Stewart in round two, but would be switching to Gove on Wednesday, because \u201cnow it\u2019s serious\u201d. Gove has privately reassured colleagues over recent months that he understands the devastating consequences of a no-deal Brexit, not least for his own environment department. He has also stressed his background as a reformer, and promised to boost education funding and tackle social care funding \u2013 all pitches that could appeal to Stewartites, potentially enabling Gove to overtake Jeremy Hunt. That would create the head-to-head between the two faces of the Vote Leave campaign that never happened in 2016, because Johnson pulled out rather than face his erstwhile friend. Jeremy Hunt Hunt\u2019s team called his showing on Wednesday a \u201cfantastic result\u201d. It was, in the sense that he avoided being overtaken by Gove, and that he picked up an extra eight votes from Tuesday\u2019s showing of 46. But there is no doubt that after three rounds of voting Hunt would have hoped to be the obvious challenger to Johnson, whereas he was only narrowly ahead of Gove, with just three votes in it. The foreign secretary\u2019s team are conscious that he risks appearing middle-of-the-road, with his rivals dismissing him as \u201ccontinuity May\u201d, or worse, Theresa in trousers, or \u201cTit\u201d for short. Hence Hunt\u2019s decision to attack Johnson for hiding from public scrutiny, and to challenge him directly over no deal, in Tuesday\u2019s TV debate. And he is clearly hoping to turn up the passion for the next round, tweeting last night that he would \u201cput his heart and soul\u201d into giving Johnson \u201cthe fight of his life\u201d. Meanwhile Amber Rudd was hosting a dinner of One Nation MPs on Wednesday evening, many of them Stewart backers, in the hope of persuading them to support Hunt. Sajid Javid Before his punchy performance in Tuesday\u2019s debate Javid appeared vulnerable, with some allies fearing that he could be overtaken by Stewart, whose off-the-wall campaign style had helped him to remain in contention. But Javid scored one of the few clear victories amid the cacophony in the BBC studio, bouncing his four colleagues into promising an independent inquiry into Islamophobia in their party \u2013 a promise the winner will now be held to. His campaign team professed themselves delighted with the result, and will now turn their attention to trying to win over Stewart\u2019s backers, by stressing Javid\u2019s liberal credentials. However, one moderate former Tory minister, who had backed Javid in the first round because of personal loyalty, said: \u201cI like him, but I can\u2019t support him because I don\u2019t agree with his politics \u2013 he\u2019s a Thatcherite.\u201d Javid looks most likely to drop out in Thursday morning\u2019s race, and there was immediate speculation that he could even do so on Wednesday night, perhaps rolling in behind Johnson in exchange for the offer of a big job. But he appeared reluctant to do that, tweeting after the second round results were announced \u201cwe can do this!\u201d A campaign source added: \u201cSaj has a funny habit of defying the odds.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
