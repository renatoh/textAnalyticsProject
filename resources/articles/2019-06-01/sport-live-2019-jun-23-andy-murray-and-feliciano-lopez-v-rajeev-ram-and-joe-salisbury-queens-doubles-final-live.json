What an effort from the Spaniard to win the singles and doubles titles here. But the story, of course, is Andy Murray. He\u2019s back! After everything, he\u2019s back! And who knows what happens next? Obviously he\u2019s winning Wimbledon next month. And then? Don\u2019t rule anything out. It\u2019s Andy Murray. Anyway that\u2019s all from me. Thanks for reading. Bye! Feliciano Lopez, who\u2019s played the last five matches on Centre Court, tells Murray it\u2019s great to see him back on the court. \u201cIt\u2019s been brilliant,\u201d Murray says. \u201cI\u2019ve really enjoyed it. I felt very relaxed at the beginning of the week and then I felt more nervous. My competitive instincts were kicking in. My hip felt great. No pain. I\u2019ll just try to keep playing. I said I would chat to my team about mixed doubles in the next few days and decide by the middle of next week.\u201d Andy Murray speaks! \u201cFeliciano was brilliant. An amazing win in the singles and even at the end of the mach there he came up with some amazing serves and brilliant returns.\u201d Andy Murray, metal hip still intact, and Feliciano Lopez, who won the singles title earlier, go up to collect the trophy. Lopez has done the singles-doubles double! Rajeev Ram and Joe Salisbury, a new pairing this year, get a big ovation as they collect their runners-up dishes. They contributed massively to an absorbing final. Would you put it past Andy Murray to request a last-minute singles wild card at Wimbledon? No, you wouldn\u2019t. Andy Murray, though. Feliciano Lopez, though. Match tie-break: Murray*/Lopez 10-5 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): Murray misses another first serve. The tension grows. But his second serve\u2019s strong and Salisbury sends a forehand return wide! Murray leaps, punches the air and hugs the incredible Feliciano Lopez! What a comeback from the former world No1!

It\u2019s championship point!

Match tie-break: Murray/Lopez* 7-4 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): Lopez serve-volleys brilliantly. Then he jumps into a celebration with Murray. How is he still going?

Then he\u2019s caught out by a Ram return down by his feet. 0-30. Soon it\u2019s 15-40 to Ram and Salisbury. Salisbury has a chance to win the set, but he nets a forehand. On the next one, however, Ram draws a wayward volley from Lopez. We\u2019ll have a match tie-break! It will be first to 10. Second set: Murray/Lopez 7-6, 5-6 Ram*/Salisbury (*denotes server): Ram holds to 15. Murray will serve to force a tie-break. Second set: Murray/Lopez* 7-6, 5-5 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): At 30-0 Murray takes a tumble on the side of the court. Panic! Only for a moment, though.

Second set: Murray/Lopez 7-6, 3-4 Ram*/Salisbury (*denotes server): Ram nets a forehand at the end of an entertaining point. 0-15. Then Salisbury smashes for 15-all. But Ram\u2019s feeling anxious. At 15-30 Murray pounces on a Ram serve, pounding a forehand down the line. Ram makes it 30-40 with a deft volley. Then Murray sends a backhand lob long. Now it\u2019s a deciding point - and Ram and Salisbury get out of jail when the latter summons a violent smash to end the argument. Second set: Murray/Lopez* 7-6, 3-3 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): Murray comes up with a sharp volley for 15-0. Then Ram clips the line with a beauty of a backhand return. Murray, always useless at HawkEye, challenges incorrectly. The game goes to 30-all. Lopez sends a serve down the middle with interest. Salisbury, channelling Murray, challenges incorrectly. It goes to 40-30 and Lopez holds. Second set: Murray/Lopez 7-6, 2-3 Ram/Salisbury* (*denotes server): It\u2019s Salisbury\u2019s turn to hold to 15. He\u2019s serving well.

Second set: Murray/Lopez 7-6, 1-2 Ram*/Salisbury (*denotes server): Ram looks comfortable at 40-0. He\u2019s made to sweat a little when Murray and Lopez get it to 40-30, though. Then a low Murray return forces Ram to volley wide. Deuce means it\u2019s a deciding point. Yet Murray misses a forehand return. He\u2019s annoyed. Second set: Murray/Lopez* 7-6, 1-1 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): Lopez wallops an ace down the middle to hold to 30. Second set: Murray/Lopez 7-6, 0-1 Ram/Salisbury* (*denotes server): Ram and Salisbury will need to clear their heads quickly. They served for the opening set and also led 5-1 in the tie-break. Encouragingly, they begin with a hold to 15 for Salisbury. First set tie-break: Murray/Lopez 8-6 Ram*/Salisbury (*denotes server): Ram serves. He\u2019s drawn to the net.

First set tie-break: Murray/Lopez 5-5 Ram/Salisbury* (*denotes server): A fizzing Murray backhand return leaves Salisbury on his knees.

First set: Murray/Lopez 6-6 Ram*/Salisbury (*denotes server): Ram holds to love to force a tie-break. First set: Murray*/Lopez 6-5 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): After all that excitement Murray messes up the first point with one of his worst every volleys. 0-15. Yet Murray finds his serve again. He holds to 30, swinging one down the middle and out of Ram\u2019s reach. First set: Murray/Lopez 5-5 Ram/Salisbury* (*denotes server): Salisbury is serving for the set. It goes to 30-all and Lopez makes it 30-40 with a cracking forehand down the line. It\u2019s effectively two break points. But Ram is strong enough at the net to deal with a Murray backhand, Lopez unable to deal with it. A deciding point, then. But it\u2019s still a break point - and that\u2019s the cue for Murray\u2019s return to click into gear, a low forehand forcing Salisbury to volley long. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Murray roars. First set: Murray/Lopez* 4-5 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): Lopez is serving to keep the opening set alive. And he holds to 15. Sir Joe Salisbury will serve for it. First set: Murray/Lopez 3-5 Ram*/Salisbury (*denotes server): You sense a Ram service game offers an instant opportunity for Murray and Lopez to break back, a feeling that grows when the American finds himself down 0-30 again. But he responds with three straight points and holds thanks to a sharp volley from Salisbury. First set: Murray*/Lopez 3-4 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): Some wonderful doubles shenanigans at 0-15. Lopez has to scramble back to the baseline to reach a volley and he shows a surprising turn of pace to get there before hooking a deep forehand back into play, at which point Salisbury nets a smash. Murray\u2019s serve is coming under pressure, though, and he finds himself facing two break points when Salisbury pounces on a poor volley from the Scot. The rangy Salisbury\u2019s looking the sharpest player out there. And it\u2019s fitting that he\u2019s the one to seal the break with a lovely forehand down the line. \u201cCome on!\u201d he cries. First set: Murray/Lopez 3-3 Ram/Salisbury* (*denotes server): Lopez is stretching a fair bit during the changeover. He must be aching after his exertions. Meanwhile Murray\u2019s a little bit annoyed with his return at the moment. It\u2019s not quite there yet and it allows Salisbury to 40-15. Salisbury holds to 40-30 when a hopeful Murray lob drops long. First set: Murray/Lopez* 3-2 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): Lopez drops the first point on serve, but he rattles through the next three. Then he seals another hold with a crisp forehand volley. It\u2019s been a good, tight start to the final. First set: Murray/Lopez 2-2 Ram*/Salisbury (*denotes server): Salisbury\u2019s under fire at the net on the first point. Eventually he finds a Murray backhand too hot to handle. These are worrying times for Ram and Salisbury. A double-fault from Ram makes it 0-30. The American\u2019s not finding his first serve. But his second clicks just well enough to force 30-all. Then he clicks into gear, sending an ace down the middle for 40-30. The American holds. First set: Murray*/Lopez 2-1 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): Murray wins the first point easily enough. Then Lopez stands firm at the net to repel a Ram forehand with an accurate volley for 30-0. At 40-0 Ram drills a backhand return down the line. Lovely shot. That one\u2019s not coming back. Then Ram and Salisbury combine well to make it 40-30, the former\u2019s forehand volley doing the job. Yet Murray holds to 30 when he whacks a backhand from left to right at the net. First set: Murray/Lopez 1-1 Ram/Salisbury* (*denotes server): Joe Salisbury to serve. It would be understandable if he\u2019s feeling a bit nervous about sharing a court with a rather famous opponent. But the local lad has to ignore the Murray factor. The first two points are shared. It goes to 30-all. Then Salisbury bangs an ace down the middle for 40-30. But Murray responds with a fizzing backhand return down the line for deuce. In doubles it\u2019s a deciding point. And although the returners choose Salisbury has to deliver to Murray again, this time the serve\u2019s good enough to outfox the Scot. First set: Murray/Lopez* 1-0 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): It\u2019s the singles champion, Feliciano Lopez, to open the doubles final \u2013 and he makes a good start, racing through a few serves to set up a 40-0 lead. He doesn\u2019t look tired at all! Give it half an hour or so, though, then we\u2019ll see. Still, a hold to love. Tok! Tok! Tok! They\u2019re knocking up. Here come the players! This is what the crowd have been waiting for. The chance to see Joe Salisbury Andy Murray! The doubles final is going to begin at 5.30pm. Enough time for Feliciano Lopez to get a quick massage. Lopez adds he doesn\u2019t have much energy left. \u201cI\u2019m going to speak to Andy now. He\u2019s going to be responsible now.\u201d Feliciano Lopez, probably the first tournament director to win a tournament, speaks! \u201cThe whole match was very exciting, except the first set, where he didn\u2019t play very good. I took this set but then he got better and better and it was really tough for me. The tie-break at the end was a lottery and it went my way.\u201d Feliciano Lopez beams as he collects his trophy. It\u2019s a wonder if he can lift the trinket above his head. Feliciano Lopez has won the singles final! He\u2019s beaten Gilles Simon 6-2, 6-7, 7-6, but he has no time to put his feet up. Now he\u2019s got to play the doubles final with Sir Andy Murray. They take on Joe Salisbury and Rajeev Ram soon. Ashleigh Barty is the new world No1! The French Open champion beat Julia Goerges to claim the title in Birmingham earlier. The singles final is going to three sets. Gilles Simon has knuckled down and won the second on a tie-break. Andy Murray will have to wait. \u201cAfternoon Jacob,\u201d Simon McMahon says. \u201cI\u2019ve missed Andy. Tennis has missed Andy. To win a doubles title in his first tournament back just six months after career saving surgery would be quite something. To see him compete in Grand Slam singles in 2020 would be quite something else. And who\u2019s to say he won\u2019t win another one? Not me, that\u2019s for sure. COME ON ANDY!!!\u201d Tennis has missed Andy. It hasn\u2019t been as fun without him. It hasn\u2019t been Andy enough. Pre-match reading Feliciano Lopez has won the first set of the singles final 6-2. The man\u2019s a machine! Speaking of splendid 37-year-olds, by the way, elsewhere Roger Federer\u2019s won a record 10th Halle title after beating David Goffin in the final. Poor Joe Salisbury. Putney\u2019s finest reaches the doubles final at Queen\u2019s and who does he find waiting for him on the other side of the net? Andy Murray, that\u2019s who. Only the greatest British player of all time. How\u2019s your luck, Joe? What a story, though. Murray being Murray, of course, perhaps we should have expected this from him as he embarks on what almost counts as a second career after all the pain he\u2019s gone through. Six months ago, though, we were all writing the obituaries. Everyone remembers that emotional press conference before the Australian Open, when it seemed he was on the verge of retirement, and assumed he\u2019d played his final ever match when he lost to Roberto Bautista Agut in the first round in Melbourne. Only, it turned out Murray wasn\u2019t ready to say goodbye. He went under the knife again, switched the faulty hip for a metal one and set about preparing for a dramatic return. And here we are. With a man who was using his racquet as a crutch not so long ago in the doubles final in his first tournament back since hip surgery. It really is ridiculous. But that\u2019s Murray for you, always ready to surprise, never willing to give in without a fight. Having said that, mind you, what\u2019s stood out about this comeback is how happy he\u2019s looked on court so far. The limp and grimace have both gone and Murray just looks like he\u2019s delighted to be playing tennis again. He isn\u2019t fighting; he\u2019s just enjoying himself and it\u2019s delightful to watch. Not that the fiery competitive spirit has disappeared, of course. No chance of that happening. Instead Murray\u2019s making big plans. He\u2019s off to Eastbourne with Brazil\u2019s Marcelo Melo, then he\u2019s off to Wimbledon to play with the excellent Pierre Hugues-Herbert and he also wants a mixed doubles partner at SW19 (Serena? Venus? Judy?). The ultimate aim is to get back into singles. But before all that he needs to win this match. It might not be straightforward, though, given that his partner, the 37-year-old Feliciano Lopez, appears to be involved in a charity tennisathon. Yesterday Lopez reached the singles final after seeing off Canada\u2019s Felix Auger-Aliassime in three sets. Then he had a short break. Then he helped Murray polish off their rain-delayed quarter-final against Dan Evans and Ken Skupski. Then he helped Murray win their semi-final against Henri Kontinen and John Peers. It was almost 9pm by the time he was done. He must be knackered. What\u2019s more, the Spaniard has to get his singles final against Gilles Simon done before this match begins. Absurd. Who knows what state he\u2019ll be in by the end of the day? One thing\u2019s for sure: he\u2019s bound to be stiff and that could play work against him. Salisbury, a 27-year-old Londoner who reached the Wimbledon semis last year, and the USA\u2019s Rajeev Ram knocked out doubles legends the Bryans brothers yesterday. They aren\u2019t to be taken lightly. Play begins ... soon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
