You can understand their stance, given the sheer quality of programming on the other channels, such as 1972\u2019s Emmerdale Farm, a reboot of Ask The Family with Dara \u00d3 Briain in the Robert Robinson role only standing up and without an elaborate combover, and highlights of the ICC Cricket World Cup, whatever that is. Whatever it is, good luck witnessing a team from England getting to the semi-final stage of that. However on Thursday evening, a record-breaking 7.6 million folk wrested the remote control from the Undercooked Pork Chops [Fiver note to self: that\u2019s pretty good, it\u2019ll catch on] to watch England thrash Norway by three goals to nil. That figure represents nearly 39% of the available audience! By comparison, only 26% of the total population of the United Kingdom went out in 2016 to vote to leave the EU. So by the political logic of the day, we should clear the television schedules for blanket coverage of women\u2019s football. Wall-to-wall females with free agency, enjoying themselves, entertaining everyone and showcasing their skills for all to see. It\u2019ll ruin the lives of every single Undercooked Pork Chop across the land, but The Fiver\u2019s prepared to take the hit, whatever the cost. It\u2019s the will of the people. Those viewers who didn\u2019t have indignant smoke pouring out of every tedious facial aperture witnessed Lucy Bronze nearly taking Ingrid Hjelmseth\u2019s head off with a long-range blast, the sort of goal Bobby Charlton used to score back in the day, and look what England achieved when he was carrying on like that. England are now waiting for the winner of Friday\u2019s stramash between hosts France and a marvellous Trump-baiting collective from across the briny, and manager Phil Neville is allowing himself to get over-excited. \u201cWe can\u2019t hide away from the fact that something is happening,\u201d he tooted, wearing his little waistcoat, hoping for gushing articles like the ones about Gareth Southgate that aren\u2019t going to come. \u201cWe want to inspire and to build a legacy.\u201d The Fiver suggests the Lionesses have done that already, whatever happens next. And if that\u2019s not achievement enough, they\u2019ve already ensured Thursday night\u2019s Piers Morgan documentary on ITV got even lower figures than it would have anyway. What a team! What a glorious nation! LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Paul Doyle from 6pm BST for hot and steamy Africa Cup of Nations MBM coverage of Morocco 1-2 Ivory Coast, while Beau Dure will be on hand at 8pm for France 1-2 USA! USA!!

QUOTE OF THE DAY 1.21pm: \u201cThe club would like to thank Martin for all his efforts during his time at the City Ground and wish him well for the future\u201d \u2013 just five months after bringing in Martin O\u2019Neill as manager, Nottingham Forest give him the heave. 1.39pm: \u201cNottingham Forest are delighted to announce that Sabri Lamouchi has been appointed\u201d \u2013 cold, unlike the body. FIVER LETTERS \u201cAs a Crystal Palace fan who has enjoyed the emergence of Aaron Wan-Bissaka as an elite full-back, it\u2019s a shame to see him leave the Eagles, but I wish him well at Manchester United. That said, if he was that desperate to play for a team with a snowball\u2019s chance in hell of winning the Premier League, he could have just stayed at Palace\u201d \u2013 Ed Taylor. \u201cRe yesterday\u2019s Fiver. Can I be one of the 1,057 to point out that you missed a golden opportunity to make a half-decent and classic Guardian culturally high-falutin\u2019 joke about the \u2018Barber of Neville\u2019? It would have involved reference to the Rossini opera that comes within a consonant of hitting the comedic bullseye. Wikipedia describes Rossini\u2019s work as \u2018one of the great masterpieces of comedy within music\u2019. Surely there\u2019s something there to work with? Indeed, as an \u2018opera buffa\u2019 (a comic opera), it has been described as the opera buffa of all opere buffe, thereby opening up the possibility of you shoehorning in a reference to the infamous Uefa/Fifa buffet. I would offer to do a bit more on your behalf, but have now run out ideas and am beginning to see why you didn\u2019t bother\u201d \u2013 Dom Hughes. \u201cIn keeping with the nominative determinism thread (Fiver letters passim), one of my groomsmen was called P Brain. He now works in insurance. Proof of theory confirmed?\u201d \u2013 Phil Devlin. \u201cMy entry to the last line\u2019s developing theme\u201d \u2013 Matt Richman.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Amr Warda\u2019s expulsion from Egypt\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations squad for alleged sexual harassment of several women online has been overturned following the intervention of several team-mates, including Mohamed Salah, who was telling Time magazine as recently as April that he hoped to help change attitudes of men in his country and across the Muslim world to \u201ctreat women with more respect\u201d. Today in Afcon 2019 unpaid player rows, Zimbabwe are threatening to withdraw from the tournament before their final group match unless its FA pulls its finger out. Netherlands striker Lieke Martens is a doubt for their Women\u2019s World Cup quarter-final with Italy after suffering foot-knack celebrating her winner against Japan. Brazil coach T1te is still in a general funk despite reaching the Copa Am\u00e9rica semis with a penalty shoot-out win over Paraguay on a shonky Gr\u00eamio Arena pitch. \u201cAll the team asked me to complain about it,\u201d he blared. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd at such a high-level match to have a ground on which it is so hard to pass. It\u2019s inconceivable anywhere in the world to have such a bad ground.\u201d Milan have been booted out of next season\u2019s Big Vase due to cash-knack. The Queen\u2019s Celtic have dropped a cool \u00a37m on Toulouse defender Christopher Jullien. And Preston have ditched their new red away kit following a less-than-welcoming response from fans. \u201cIt was felt in these circumstances that it was both expensive and unfair for us to make last season\u2019s yellow away kit option obsolete,\u201d parped the club.
