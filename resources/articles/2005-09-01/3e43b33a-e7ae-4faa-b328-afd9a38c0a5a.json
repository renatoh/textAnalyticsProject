Victims of other atrocities do not. Isn't it time we dropped the whole idea?", "bodyText": "I can understand why Muslims might find Holocaust Memorial Day - which for the past four years has had official status and the backing of Tony Blair and the Queen - exclusionary. Why, the Muslim committees advising the prime minister have asked, are atrocities committed against Jews favoured in this way? There is an answer to that: the Holocaust, in its planned and systematic nature and in the vast numbers who perished, was a far greater evil than any other perpetrated in recent times, and deserves the pre-eminent attention devoted to it. That is a not an answer that satisfies the Muslim community. They too have been the victims of great atrocities (as have many other ethnic and racial groups, and religious followers), without having a special day to commemorate their suffering. But the solution is not, as has been suggested, to incorporate the Holocaust into a national Genocide Memorial Day. Genocide - a word invented in 1943 by Raphael Lemkin, uniting the Greek genos (race or tribe) with the Latin occidere (to kill) - has many nuanced definitions, but what is essential is an intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, coupled with action which achieves that end. Earlier this week the chief of a charity giving aid to Palestinians was quoted as referring to the genocide of Palestinians by Israel. That demonstrates the problem. However brutally Israel has behaved, it is nonsense to suggest that it has been carrying out a plan to wipe out the Palestinian people. There is an argument that, in the past hundred years, apart from the Holocaust, only the Rwandan massacre qualifies as pure genocide. But then, what about Muslims butchered in Bosnia, Armenians massacred by the Turks, the atrocities in Darfur? Where does one draw the line? That definitional uncertainty, and the continuing controversies over the facts, is a good reason for abandoning any thought of a Genocide Day. Crimes against humanity is an internationally accepted label for state-ordered acts of cruelty that are less than genocide, but I do not think that the prospect of an official day dedicated to victims of such crimes will prove any less controversial than the present debates over the Holocaust and genocide. The real question should be: why do we need any such, officially blessed, memorial days at all? \u00b7 When Tony Blair had his recent heart flutters, the hospital he was in (briefly), and an array of doctors, plied the viewing and reading public with more details about his minor condition than we could ever want to know. When President Jacques Chirac left hospital a few days ago after a week's stay, the public still wasn't sure exactly why he'd been there. None of the doctors involved in his treatment, nor anyone from the hospital, explained anything to the media. It was left to the president's much mistrusted spokespersons to issue vague statements about a slight vascular accident - which, without more detail, meant little. Chirac's secretiveness was something he learned from his recent predecessors. I was quite often in France during the last year of Georges Pompidou's presidency. Those in the know, politicians and journalists (not including me), were aware that he had a serious form of cancer and was receiving treatment for it, but not a hint of it was revealed to the rest of us. We saw him on television (though not all that often) and in newspaper photographs, and commented vaguely on his unhealthy appearance. When he failed to appear at scheduled meetings or events, officials fed us a variety of excuses, usually on the theme of influenza. The newspapers, who knew the truth, didn't reveal it to us until after his death, in office, in May 1974. President Mitterrand took office in 1981 with a promise of greater transparency. He would issue regular bulletins about his health. He did so, except that the bulletins were a pack of lies. Mitterrand had been diagnosed with prostate cancer soon after his election. For more than 10 years, his doctor (as he revealed in a book published after Mitterrand's death, for which he was taken to court and punished for breaching medical confidence), issued statements falsely testifying to the minister's rude health. Mitterrand fought, and won, a presidential election in 1988 without informing the electorate of his life-threatening condition. Would they have voted the same way had they known? Those who did know - many journalists among them - didn't think it important enough to share with the public, or perhaps they were too scared to confront France's strict privacy laws? Chirac learned a lesson. Mitterrand didn't tell the public about his illness, and was re-elected. Chirac is still considering standing again, in 2007. Maybe if he were to keep the public ignorant of his condition, and its possible longer term effects, he too could be voted back. The difference between then and now is that the French media is no longer willing to accept supinely the secrecy of a president's health. For the first time, last week, newspapers expressed their dissatisfaction. Future French presidents will have to accept that their coughs, colds and cancers belong to their citizens. \u00b7 I have always smiled for passport photographs, and for any other snaps that people have had the unwisdom to take of me. It is generally recognised among my friends (and others) that, on film, my serious mien furnishes me with a scared and guilty look, the kind that propels simple members of the public to the nearest police station, claiming to have spotted the desperado on that Wanted poster. So I smile. It's not just a question of vanity. The eager grin on my passport tells immigration officers how delighted I am to be in their wonderful country. They cannot resist welcoming me in. But what will happen now that I am to be banned from smiling for the passports? My photo scowls at the immigration officer. She scowls back. Worse, I look suspicious. She cannot believe that I'm not on her list of un-desirables. I am detained for questioning. Deported. And all that because someone with nothing better to do has decided that the new biometric (whatever that means) machines can't read happy, only dour. \u00b7 This week Marcel saw The Intruder: \"A film by French director Claire Denis, beautiful, often haunting, but with an incomprehensible storyline.\" Marcel read, not for the first time Hear Me Talkin' To Ya by Hentoff and Shapiro: \"As an antidote to New Orleans today, a history of jazz when that city was at its most exuberant.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
