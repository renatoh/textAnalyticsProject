Click here to view Hometown: London. The lineup: Colin Mac (bass, guitar, backing vocals) and Miriam Massie (vocals, synths). The background: Ink are a new duo \u2013 the hot new unit of measure for any discerning rock act \u2013 and they are, we think, going to be massive. And if they're not, it will be the result of bad luck and timing. They are perfect without being too box-ticking, \"now\" without pandering to trends. Well, not too much pandering. With Amy Winehouse's engineer on board as producer, they've got the soul angle covered, only what they do is as much nu-R&amp;B as the '60s variety. Think AlunaGeorge in Memphis, or something. According to their press release, Ink \"sound like Lykke Li, Sufjan Stevens or Alex Winston \", which we can't see at all, but to be fair, each of the three songs we've heard is completely different. Mac and Massie apparently already have 25 tracks \"at various stages of completion\", and a debut album already written, so maybe they're thinking of one of their others. Of the three that we've got, one sounds like the Pretenders doing Beyonc\u00e9, one makes us think (possibly because we have overactive imaginations) of New Order jamming with a girl group, and the third isn't so much dubstep or blubstep as cutestep. Mac and Massie, two Londoners from Liverpool and Glasgow, only recently got together. Massie is a classically trained pianist, and Mac's uncle performed in a pub covers band, which inspired his nephew to \"play anything that came to hand\". His first recorded experiments involved a laptop and his uncle's bass; after that he worked with Dom Morley \u2013 the Grammy-winning engineer on Back to Black \u2013 at the controls. \"Dom's been brilliant,\" says Mac. \"He tidies tracks up and makes them sparkle, and adds space.\" Ink Goes On is about a girl who wants her lover to communicate with her, but only in ink, because \"ink lasts\". The track has a loping bassline that reminds us of New Order circa Lonesome Tonight and a melodic topline that is R&amp;B-licious. It's so catchy you can imagine it driving you mad after heavy radio rotation, but what it does do is confirm that here we have two talented tunesmiths \u2013 this, and the other two tracks we've heard, aren't just riffs or grooves, they're proper songs. Control is completely different; faster, propelled by guitar, sort of power pop, with shades of Nick Lowe's Cruel to be Kind or a Pretenders track, then changes tack totally after 30 seconds to become bouncy R&amp;B pop. The lyric-hook is memorable - \"Have you ever seen me lose control?\" - and the chorus is Chrissie Hynde meets Katy Perry. That's our one-line pitch anyway. Then it goes back to slick technoid R&amp;B pop, with a finger-clicking bassline and cool, aloof vocals. Brilliant. Our Song is an obvious next single, with enough post-Lana appeal to appease the blogerati and enough obvious charms to seduce the masses. \"They're playing our song,\" cheers Massie. They probably will be before we know it. The buzz: \"Ink Goes On is an alternative summer anthem that's come four months too late. A wonderful little left-of-centre pop song\" \u2013 When the Gramophone Rings The truth: Indelible. Most likely to: Take control of the charts. Least likely to: Use quills. What to buy: Ink Goes On is self-released in October. File next to: Remi Nicole, AlunaGeorge, Chrissie Hynde, King. Further info: soundcloud.com. Monday's new band: Eddi Front."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
