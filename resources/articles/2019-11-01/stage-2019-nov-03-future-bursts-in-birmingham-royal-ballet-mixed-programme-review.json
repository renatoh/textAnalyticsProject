Dance Umbrella\u2019s closing show for 2019, The Future Bursts In, features zero women and four male choreographers, one of whom (Merce Cunningham) is dead. The first piece, Somewhere in the Middle of Infinity, is choreographed by Amala Dianor and performed by three dancers, including Dianor himself. With its noncombative, collegiate style, open spiralling movements and loose jumps, it\u2019s a warm, sophisticated blend of street dance, hip-hop, contemporary and even t\u2019ai chi movements. However, the substance soon evaporates and begins to resemble an extended Uniqlo advert. The young dancers of the CCN-Ballet de Lorraine stream on for a striking piece, For Four Walls, by Petter Jacobsson and Thomas Caley, to John Cage\u2019s original score for the lost Cunningham dance-play Four Walls. Crowded dancers rehearse combinations, reworking steps without looking at one another or the audience. Grimly intense, even compulsive, it speaks of the diligence, brevity, ambition and loneliness of a dancer\u2019s life. There are five extended moments when male dancers fill the space and grandstand; a whirling dervish, Nathan Gracia, stands out from the melee. There are no such opportunities for the women. A swagged fabric backdrop descends for Cunningham\u2019s Sounddance (tonight\u2019s programme marks the centenary of his birth). David Tudor\u2019s music is a restless, clicking whirl, underneath which the dancers careen sexlessly. It\u2019s pure Cunningham: the tense, splayed bodies and stiff little jumps that suggest puppets, cogs or automata. Dancers lift and push each other like metronomes and pendulums, turning lindy hops and waltz movements into a dazzling robotic endurance test. Birmingham Royal Ballet\u2019s mixed bill at Sadler\u2019s Wells starts with A Brief Nostalgia, a strong piece by Jack Lister, with design by Thomas Mika. Thrown into shadow against an enormous grey wall, women writhe, haunted by their bland male partners and borne up, carried, cradled, lifted or tugged by the horrors and pleasures of love. It\u2019s a bit literal: rapture at midnight, torment in the pitiless light of dawn, breaking up in the rain, dark satin and dry ice. But it has style. The concrete landscape only occasionally resembles a communist frieze about self-sacrificing workers. The Suit is choreographed by Cathy Marston for the pioneering Ballet Black. It leaves a nasty taste, with its character-led narrative about a cheating wife who gets what she deserves. Overacted and broadbrush, this sexist cartoon can\u2019t be saved by the anguished power of Cira Robinson as the wife and Jos\u00e9 Alves \u2013 simultaneously hulking and delicate \u2013 as the husband. Both are fantastic, but they deserve better. Thank heavens for Twyla Tharp and the purple glitterball that descends for Nine Sinatra Songs. The stage is bare as knackered couples drag each other around the last chance saloon. Sinatra\u2019s That\u2019s Life is transformed into a lovers\u2019 hate-duet, a spiky, slow duel of clenched fists and unwilling movement \u2013 Delia Mathews is excellent. The choreography is full of missed connections, fumbled handholds, out-of-phase steps, clunky transitions and straining lifts. In this piece, and also in the opener, my eye was repeatedly drawn to Samara Downs: a glimmeringly charismatic presence.
