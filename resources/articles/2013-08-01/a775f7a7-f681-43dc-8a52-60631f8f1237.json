Coming from a background in corporate development and healthcare, he earned his chops in marketing at an advertising agency, before striking out on his own as an independent consultant. When Ford got him on board to oversee the firm's social media marketing effort, it needed some tender loving care, he recalls. \"At the time, we were just doing social media as something of a hobby,\" Monty says. \"There was no overall strategy, no consistency. Since then, we've adopted the point of view that the social element is part of nearly everything we do in communications and marketing.\" Monty integrated social marketing into all of Ford's marketing activities, rather than maintaining it as a separate stream. \"Whether it's how we tell a story about a piece of news, or how we think up the campaign for a big vehicle launch \u2013 or how we handle things on our own site \u2013 we want to make content accessible and shareable on a wide variety of platforms.\" This has led to several ground-breaking campaigns at Ford in the US, such as the Fiesta Movement campaign, launched in 2009 to accompany the car's redesign. Before anyone else had access to them, 100 people were given new Fiestas to drive for six months. The drivers had total freedom to use their new car, but were asked to make a video each month to document their exploits. \"They were talking about the vehicle in their own voice,\" says Monty. \"It wasn't just great for people to hear from other people they could identify with; it was also a signal that we were so comfortable with our product that we were willing to hand it over to others and let them carry the message.\" During that campaign, 132,000 unique visitors \u2013 82% of whom had never owned a Ford \u2013 gave their email addresses to Ford, asking to learn more about the car. Although this measurement is important, Monty says, social media for Ford is more about brand awareness than driving specific sales. \"The auto industry has complex sales and it's a process that takes a number of input points that are all over the place,\" he says, adding that social media can influence consumers at any stage of the sales funnel. \"But it's usually more effective around the general awareness and word-of-mouth stages. It's not as if we tweet a link and someone goes out and buys something.\" Marketing professionals' knowledge of consumers is becoming more sophisticated, Monty says, based on what consumers choose to share and with whom: \"If we can't directly determine things, we can still start to triangulate based on all of this data coming together.\" This doesn't mean that big data \u2013 the art of manipulating vast databases of information for useful insights \u2013 has become a mainstream marketing tool yet, warns Monty. \"We have to master small data first,\" he jokes. Separating the important facts from the terabytes of chatter is a tricky task. But social media is as much about inspiring and communicating as it is about measuring and quantifying. In 2001, the company unveiled the Ford Explorer and structured a social media campaign around it that broke with tradition. Normally, cars are launched at auto shows and the information is disseminated to the public via a busy, distracted press corps that controls the message. This time, the firm also launched the car on Facebook, announcing a sweepstake through which someone would win a Ford Explorer when the page reached 30,000 fans. \"We wanted to own the news and we did it by combining paid, owned and earned efforts,\" Monty says, adding that, for the first time, he got digital marketing, social and PR teams to work in unison. \"Rather than working in parallel, we worked on the same thing for the same results. We got a bigger result that day than for a Super Bowl ad.\" Building on the success of his social media endeavours, Monty is now revamping the Fiesta Movement campaign for the launch of the 2014 model. \"There was no paid media during the first iteration of the Fiesta Movement campaign; it was all social,\" he says. \"Now there's a mix. We're involved with the X Games \u2013 there's sponsorship there. We're also involved with the Bonnaroo music festival.\" The auto giant will also try to integrate Fiesta Movement into every advertising campaign it runs, he says. Video and other digital products created by Fiesta Movement participants will be integral to the traditional part of the campaign as well. \"All of our digital, print and TV advertising will come from the content that's being created by the 100 individuals now.\" What would Monty's advice be to other companies embarking on social media campaigns? \"If you have a strong product, don't be afraid to let go and let others tell your story,\" he says. Marketers have been focused for many years on being good stewards of the brand, but things are different now. \"The reality is that the brand is what your customers say it is, not what you say it is,\" he concludes. \"We're relying on word of mouth that's turbo-charged.\" From the Salesforce Partner Zone: 5 social media lessons to learn from Ford"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
