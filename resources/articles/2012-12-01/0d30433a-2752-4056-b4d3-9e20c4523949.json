Costs so far: \u00a317m. And what have we achieved with that? A site that has been advertising fake jobs for such as an MI6 \"target elimination specialist\", \"international couriers\" to work for CosaNostra Holdings, as well as listings for pornographic websites. This is tomfoolery of a very high standard, no doubt about it. We throw rotten eggs at Iain Duncan Smith and that is inevitable, because he is the responsible secretary of state, but we should perhaps reserve a few for Monster, the company that won the tender to run Universal Jobmatch. And how did that happen? Well, Monster won the competitive process, all fair and square, but from what we are told, they only won at the second time of asking. It is said that an initial tendering process, which Monster didn't win, was botched, and consequently had to be scrapped. Is this true, we asked the Department of Work and Pensions. Well, we can say that \"Monster submitted the tender which scored the highest evaluation score,\" was the answer. But was that the only tender process, or did you have to run a second, we asked. \"I'm not going to get into the contractual process,\" said a spokeswoman, having taken an entire evening to think about it. The lights are on, but nobody's home. \u2022 But then one understands the general wish to keep the mechanics of these things secret. There's the issue of commercial confidentiality. And then there is always the potential for embarrassment. Why talk? Nobody wins. And nobody focuses on the successful private tendering processes \u2013 which is strange, because there are so many of them. Think of the public-private partnership contracts on the London Underground, the school building contracts that are costing the taxpayer and the schools themselves countless millions. The West coast mainline contract fiasco that had to be abandoned under threat of legal challenge. Think G4S at the Olympics. Quite the list to be proud of, isn't it? \u2022 Just two kinds of people exist this Christmas: those who have a card from the hyperactive Keith Vaz, chair of the Commons home affairs select committee, and the others. The others are a sorry bunch. For they don't have enclosed within a Christmas card the glossy colour booklet celebrating in words and pictures Vaz's 25 years as a parliamentarian, a milestone passed in June. They probably won't see the congratulatory message from David Cameron and the foreword from Ed Miliband. They'll miss the snapshots \u2013 Keith with Kofi Annan, Bill Clinton, Lewis Hamilton, Madeleine Albright, Jesse Jackson, Lennox Lewis, and indeed, Nelson Mandela. They'll have a Christmas of sorts,of course they will, but it won't be the same. \u2022 We hear little further, meanwhile, of Roger Scruton's brave plot to wrest back control of Britain's institutions from the grip of the Guardianista left. The shutters have gone up. And we must accept that having said he would a fortnight ago, Matthew Elliott, Scruton's co-conspirator and head man at the \"non-ideological\" TaxPayers' Alliance, is probably not going to ring us back. We can only watch and wait. Still this is God's work, and there will always be somebody willing to diagnose just where we have gone wrong and make public their plans for putting things right. Out there in front is Dr Sean Gabb, self-proclaimed writer of \"a million words of journalism\" and director of the all-seeing Libertarian Alliance. Gabb authored a book, Cultural Revolution, Culture War: How Conservatives Lost England, and How to Get It Back, in which he explains how the \"current ruling class has turned England into a totalitarian police state, and how this ruling class can be overthrown and utterly destroyed\". He and the Scruton-ites don't agree on everything, but one does see them shaking things up a bit. Making England England again. \u2022 Finally, royal news; the numbers are in, and now we can assess the success of Prince Charles's recent trip to New Zealand. His support was unchanged. But the number of New Zealanders who would really rather like a republic apparently jumped six points to 41%. Well done, sir.
