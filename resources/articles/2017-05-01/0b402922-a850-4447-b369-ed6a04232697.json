A Gentle Creature is a brutally realist movie \u2013 at least at first \u2013 that takes its heroine on a pilgrimage into the vast, trackless forest of national suffering. Yet it does this with an unsettling, accelerating pattern of eerie coincidences and echoes, which finally mutates into a kind of satirical expressionism \u2013 a set-piece flourish which some might consider a bit of a narrative evasion or even an undermining of that basis of authenticity on which we had understood the movie. But it certainly provides a convulsive, if not cathartic kind of horror. Vasikina Makovtseva plays the \u201cgentle\u201d or \u201cmeek creature\u201d of the title: a woman whose sharp, pinched, unsmiling face has become an impassive mask due to the obvious hardship of her life. The film takes as its inspiration or starting point the short story of the same title by Dostoyevsky in which this woman is the much-wronged young wife of a pawnbroker. The female protagonist of this movie finds herself in a different situation, but perhaps related in kind, and Loznitsa gives her situation aspects of Dostoyevsky, Gogol and Nekrasov \u2013 and also Kafka in the bureaucratic nightmare which forms part of her ordeal. She is living on her own, with a job as the overnight minder of a tiny petrol station, sleeping in a rudimentary little hut while at work, and living in a cottage with her dog. One day, she receives word from the post office that a parcel that she has sent has been returned to sender and that she must pay a fee to get it back \u2013 the first of many petty bureaucratic inconveniences and humiliations. This is in fact a care package of food and clothes that she had sent to her husband who is in prison for a murder, a conviction he denies. What on earth has happened to him? No-one can or will tell her, so she has no choice but to beg for time off work and take a hugely long and arduous rail journey to Siberia and to the prison town itself, to find out what has become of him. And this journey takes her back into the past, at first the 20th century with its memories of Stalin and the second world war, statues and street-names dedicated to the communist icons of old. Finally, her ordeal takes her effectively even further back, to the grim palace prison, like an army encampment of the 19th century, with its attendant \u201ccamp follower\u201d community of crooks, gangsters, prostitutes and wretched wives and petitioners just like this woman, desperate for news, any news, of the loved ones who have been arbitrarily liquidated by the Russian state. Finally, after being repeatedly denied information even at the gates of the prison itself, the stoic woman is told by locals that she must contact the wiseguy who really runs the place, and who will perhaps tell her the truth \u2013 but at a terrible price. The pure hell of her situation is provided by the other people the woman has to encounter on her journey and at her\u2019s journey\u2019s end. The calvary consists in just listening to them, as they are squashed uncomfortably together in buses, trains, railway station waiting rooms and chaotic boarding houses where drink is the only anaesthetic against misery. The gargoyle faces that Loznitsa conjures are extraordinary, people laughing, singing, arguing, crying, leering \u2013 while the woman\u2019s own face stays empty and still. She has to listen to their unbearably crass conversation, which is sometimes horrible, sometimes appallingly sad, sometimes very funny. There is an extraordinary guy presiding over a grotesque booze-up in their rooming house who claims once to have held a job as a newspaper crime correspondent and a children\u2019s poet. Whatever the truth, he is now just another drunken lost soul in this Inferno. And all the time there is a nightmarish tic or quirk in which we start to notice things repeating themselves \u2013 a woman who claims to be the sister of the identical woman we had seen earlier, recurring gossip about a woman called Zinka, stomach turning rumours about a body chopped up and left in a wood. The closer this woman gets to the impenetrable heart of the mystery, the more insistent this ominous patterning becomes. A Gentle Creature has a gaunt sense of its own Russianness, and it has also a kind of Ancient Mariner address to the audience: it is gripping and absorbing in its way, although perhaps too conscious of its own metaphorical properties and opinion may divide as to whether its expressionist element works. Yet there is no doubt as to its power, and its severity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
