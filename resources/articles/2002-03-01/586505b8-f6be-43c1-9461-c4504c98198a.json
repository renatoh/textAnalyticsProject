A second scan conducted in Leeds on Wednesday revealed that Bellamy has a tear in a tendon in the knee and could be out of action for up to six weeks. \"We don't know how long Craig will be out,\" the Newcastle manager Bobby Robson said yesterday, \"but we could be talking several weeks. It depends how it heals. He's got a small tear in his knee, he has a touch of tendinitis and there is inflammation. It is a crucial blow to us.\" Bellamy, 22, has played in all but one of Newcastle's Premiership games this season. In his absence Shola Ameobi is likely to play against Arsenal tomorrow, though Carl Cort is again fit. Steven Gerrard is to receive treatment in France in an effort to recover from a groin injury in time to play in Liverpool's critical Champions League match in Barcelona later this month. The England midfielder was carried off during the goalless draw with Galatasaray at Anfield last week after stretching to make a tackle and will visit Dr Philippe Boixel, the specialist who has treated the 21-year-old's niggling injuries over the past three seasons. Blackburn Rovers have received a work permit for the Galatasaray defender Hakan Unsal. Terms had already been agreed with player and club, and Blackburn have until noon today to secure international clearance from the Turkish league if the player is to be available for tomorrow's match against Bolton. The FA's four-year partnership with Axa, sponsor of the FA Cup, is to come to a conclusion at the end of this season after the insurance firm failed to agree terms over a new deal. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
