Only there isn't one. Shocking from Bolton, really. Even in the final third, they're thinking cautiously. It's the last move of note, as the referee blows for time to a chorus of boos. And quite right too. That's it. I'll leave the last word to Nick from Dartmouth College, who says he never saw The Office, although his current girlfirend (categorically not Vikki, remember) \"claims to have been flatmates with the fat one. It's a very small world.\" Indeed it is, Nick: The Office is on BBC2 right now. In fact, maybe I'll just do a minute-by-minute on that inst... On second thoughts. Good night. 89 Sunderland would like a penalty for N'Gotty's floor challenge on Flo. Wolstenhome's having none of it, though 86 Both sides look spent. The words launch, hoof and welly spring to mind far more readily than others such as probe, scheme and interesting. In a word, pppprrrrpppppppfffffff. 81 Sunderland are straight back up the other end, but Tore Andre Flo's volley wafts over. And, after that rude interruption, back to Nick at Dartmouth. He says, that, \"to get a rise out of {Vikki}, you should tell her she should have shagged the Yale fridge repair man.\" Vikki... oh, you can read. 80 Another Goal!? Phil Babb reacts in lightning fashion to a weak Mike Whitlow header to flick it in. Unfortunately for him, though, its past his own goalkeeper, the culmination of a muffed clearance attempt by Kevin Kilbane. A sad, sad goal. Bolton 1 - 1 Sunderland. 75 Kevin Phillips looks a little jaded as he slopes off, replaced by Tore Andre Flo, himself making his first appearance under Wilko. Super, Super Kev, sing the Sunderland fans. Not tonight, he wasn't. Nick Johnston's here to clarify Vikki Abrahams sloppy-sounding shout out earlier on. \"We're both from London (we grew up three miles apart) and met over here in the USA. Now she is at Yale and I'm at Dartmouth.\" He says. He goes on, too:\"But no 'relationship' as such\". Sounds a bit like pre-Rachel Tim in the Office when Dawn is mentioned, to me. Denial tells its own story, Nick. 73 A Bolton corner leads to all kind of comedy in the Sunderland area, a spell of head tennis ending with Macho having it nodded out of his grasp by Gavin McCann before they clear and are prevented from making a great chance of their own only by Kevin Phillips straying offside in a not-very-goal-poacherly fashion. 70 The Bolton fans aren't too pleased as Bernard Mendy, fresh from his most impressive contribution yet, is replaced by Anthony Barness. Sam Allardyce looks like he really cares. 68 Campo's booked for Bolton after a tatty challenge on Phillips 20 yards out from the Bolton goal. The freekick is charged down, though, and the homeside break excitedly through Mendy. His ball is destined, in a bobbly kind of way, for Michael Ricketts, but Kilbane gets back to make a superbly timed interception. 66 Okocha's presence has sparked Bolton a little, with wingback Mendy having a pop of his own. In keeping with the game, though, it goes out for a throw in on the far side. Dave from Norway's back. Apparently Big Dave is fine, \"although the dave, his daveness, the davester, dave-arino and el d\u00e4vo are all acceptable, thanks\". And I bet you like bowling, too, right? 64 Not for the first time Gardner skins Kilbane, and not for the first time, the Irishman brings him down with a lame challenge. With this foul far nearer the box than the first yet equally clumsy, he can consider himself a bit lucky to avoid a second yellow. 62 It's all a bit hit-and-hope from Bolton. Another ball popps up for Frandsen on the edge of the Sunderland box, but his first touch ruins any chance and his shot sails wide. 61 Great work by David Bellion, bringing it out from deep inside his own half and attracting the attention of a handful of Bolton players before working it out to the right. The move eventually sees George McCartney firing tamely wide, but the creds go to the Frenchman. 57 Bolton hoik off Kevin Nolan, replacing him with Jay Jay Okocha. It's been a fits-and-farts start for Jay Jay so far this season at the Reebok. Which will it be tonight? Fit or fart? 55 Bolton, fancying some, get a couple of leftwing corners. Ricardo Gardner manages to find Ivan Campo's crudely coiffed head with the first, but it's all slapdash, really. At least I have some tea now, though. Kym's back, and she's rejuvenated by the apology amnesty: \"Well in that case, just tell Brendan I'm taking a sickie and not coming into work today. And I'm not sorry about it either.\" Go girl! She does sound a bit hoarse, mind, Brendan. 53 Jurgen Macho takes an age to take a deep freekick affter Bolton are caught offside. However, the referee mercilessly insists he hurries it up. It's okay for him. He only lives down the road. 50 Aww. Vikki Abrahams (that's The Pixie) wants to say 'hello' to Nick Johnston. What is this, Our Tune? 48 Gavin McCann gets Sunderland's second yellow card for upending, erm, somebody. Kym has emailed in again to apologetically clarify her exact whereabouts. Canberra, apparently. No need for sorries, though, Kym. We're all friends here, brought together by the love of underhit crosses and overhit clearances. 47 Djorkaeff gets a break, but he is the definition of a quick (rather than fast) player, and he can't make use of his space, Craddock blocking his eventual shot. It comes back, though, and Frandsen volleys just wide. Well, I say just... Not half time any more Michael Ricketts is the cursed one as far as Sky's Player Cam's concerned. It got Kilbane booked before. What can it do for the one-time England prospect's shoddy work-in-progress? The visitors kick off with neither side showing any changes. Somebody must like what they're seeing, I suppose. Still half-time I am moved. The shouts are coming in thick and fast. Dave (can I call you 'Big Dave', Dave?) from Norway \"couldn't tear himself away\" and is back from the pub already with a few tinnies, while Kym Muller from Australia somewhere says just \"chin up. Not long to go\". Well, that depends on how you look at it, Kym, but thanks so much for your words. It means a lot, y'know. Half time Barely any time left before Wolstenhome blows for oranges. I don't want to pour further scorn on a predicament which is mine as much as it is yours, but I can't imagine the game will benefit as a spectacle against a Wilkinson side that is struggling to score. I expect the visitors to lock up, and an even more tense affair after the break. Er, what am I saying, it's what the game needed, Bolton will be all-guns, etc. Ah, I can't bring myself. I'm off to find tea. First half injury time What? GOAL? Michael Gray scores a cracking goal which owes something to the dismal tone of the match so far: it was a definite if-you-don't-buy-a-ticket moment. 20-odd yards out, low and clean along the ground to Jaaskelainen's right and in off the post. Bolton 0 - 1 Sunderland. 44 A booking! Yes! For Kevin 'Killer' Kilbane. His crime: felling Ricardo Gardner on the charge down Sunderland's right. The freekick is headed over by Ricketts, though. 43 Campo, not at the races tonight, controls a naff Michael Gray long ball with the apparent (yet completely unnecessary) use of both arms. Ref Wolstenholme simply cannot be arsed to give the freekick, though, and \"play\" continues. 41 We've run out of teabags. Not even any bliddy Earl Grey. What kind of a half-arsed operation is this? Why do I already regret asking that question? 37 Bad news for Sunderland, and the game in general one imagines, as Claudio Reyna, their only truly imaginative player, has gone down after a poorly timed challenge (of his own, that is) and is currently grimacing in agony on the deck. He ain't coming back for a while. Paul Thirlwell is stripping off to replace him. Now that whets the appetite, doesn't it? God help us. 35 Ivan Campo, clearly wondering what the hell has happened to his career, falls asleep, his slip letting Claudio Reyna in. The American's cross is no good for Kevin Phillips, waiting at the back stick, though, and Bolton deal easily with the subsequent corner. 33 Bolton seem to \"want\" this a little more than Howard Wilkinson's new charges, but neither side seems at all capable of using the Reebok's immense playing surface to work any decent openings. 29 \"You poor bastard\" offers Dave McInnes from Norway, supportively, before adding that he's off for a beer. Enjoy, Dave. Think of me. Think of Kevin Kilbane, too, whose silky touch is to be scrutinised by Sky's Player Cam for the next 15 minutes. 26 Sunderland keeper Thomas Myhre apparently knack'd his thigh in his first kick of the game, and has been replaced by Jurgen Macho. In case you wondered, Bolton have been sniffing around the visitor's box without really looking too dangerous. 22 Djorkaeff switches the play superbly from the right touchline, enticing a run out of Ricardo Gardner. In his haste, the Bolton man loses control a bit and his cross is dealt with, nodded behing by Jodie Craddock. Djorkaeff, Football's only hope in this game, then curls his corner out of play. 19 \"Oooooh\" go the Bolton fans as Mike Whitlow's miss-hit cross becomes a pathetic-looking attempt to chip the Sunderland keeper. Y'see, that's the problem with your British football fan: they accept this kind of thing because, you know, \"at least they're having a go\". They wouldn't stand for it in Spain, y'know. 15 Whitlow gets a flick on to an excellent (steady on...) long throw in, but Ricketts can't quite react in time as it bounces teasingly across Myhre's goal. Ed Brickell has emailed in to question the import of tonight's match, vis-a-vis it deserving a minute-by-minute. \"What next, the Britney Spears desk?\" he says. Au contraire, Mr Brickell, we operate a policy of complete impartiality at GU. Just be thankful it was this that came out of the hat and not Marine v Barrow. As for the Britney Spears desk, I'll let MediaUnlimited know. 11 Back at the other end (it really isn't that sort of game, though, I promise you) and Ricardo Gardner has a \"shot\" from about 25 yards. It hardly registered as a decent chance, but that the ball subsequently barely managed to creep over the goal line by the far corner flag says enough, I hope. Pretty much as expected so far. 9 The other Frenchman on show, David Bellion is causing Bolton bother down their left. After a quick break, his low cross is just behind Phillips, who tries to flick it through his legs, but it ends up just sort of reminding you how long it is since he scored. 7 Djorkaeff has the first meaningful effort, blazing low past Myhre's righthand post. 5 Sunderland, in their fetching turquoise away kit, are having the better of the early exchanges. Bellion's pace wins a corner which comes to nothing. A second, however, falls to a surprised Phillips at the near post. Out of the scoring habit, he can't control it in time and it goes wide of his shin. 3 Claudio Reyna earns and takes a free kick 40 yards out in the inside left channel, but it is cleared nicely by the returning N'Gotty. Bolton reorganise and almost see Michael Ricketts break away, but last man Steven Wright tidies up. Phew! 1 min Kevin Nolan has a little saunter forward doiwn the right and thinks he's won the first corner, but in fact concedes a throw after letting it roll out. Good start, then. Preamble Good evening and welcome. Now, if you're logging on right now, wherever in this big wide world you are, chances are there are places you'd rather be. We're here to assure you that there are some merits in spending the next couple of hours in nice warm offices/strorerooms/sheds/call centres/university libraries/other countries, even if you do have little choice in the matter. Bolton and Sunderland promises little, but rest assured, it's what English football is all about. A cold, windy, unwelcoming autumn's evening and two sides who need a result more then John Leslie needs a solid character witness. Whoever loses will be bottom by 10pm. As far as the teams are concerned, the home side welcome back centre back Bruno N'Gotty to their back three after seven games out. Sunderland have Thomas Myhre in goal making his first appearance since joining from Everton, while goal-less Super Kevin Phillips is partnered upfront by speedy Frenchman David Bellion. Niall Quinn, meanwhile, goes for a scan tomorrow, the results of which may mean the end of his playing career. Needless to say, he's not on the bench. Tore Andre Flo is, though. Bolton: Jaaskelainen, Mendy, N'Gotty, Whitlow, Gardner, Frandsen, Campo, Nolan, Farrelly, Djorkaeff, Ricketts. Subs: Poole, Pedersen, Okocha, Dean Holdsworth, Barness.
