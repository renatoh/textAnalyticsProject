By that Hayes meant the Communication Workers Union has held a ballot \u2013 as the miners' leadership did not \u2013 and won a three to one majority on a 67% turnout; 61,623 is also an absolute, if slim, majority of the CWU's 120,000 members. Fair enough, but a Scargill analogy is rarely encouraging except to the reckless. Labour MPs who were involved in the NUM's strike and sympathise with the postal workers shudder at the thought of this week's two-day stoppage. It will throw postal services into chaos \u2013 and encourage private competitors to further erode Royal Mail's business. It has lost 10% by volume in the past year, including that of Amazon this month. Every 1% costs \u00a370m in lost revenue.. Will management and union be able to draw back from mutually assured catastrophe and restart talks courtesy of the conciliation service Acas (sole survivor of the pre-Thatcher industrial era) before Thursday's walkout? Some MPs detect minuscule shifts, a hint from Lord (\"beyond anger\") Mandelson, the business secretary, that Acas might be acceptable, quickly followed by management today. Both sides are still demanding pre-concessions: the union to suspend its strike, management not to hire 15,000 extra seasonal workers to beat it. Others fear the death wish may be too strong. Adam Crozier, Royal Mail's \u00a33m-a-year (including banker-style bonuses) chief executive, countenances an alpha-male style of management which made the Football Association (his last job) the success it wasn't. It is matched by Hayes's union executive, with both attitudes replicated locally, albeit patchily. Condemnation of both sides is best expressed by the fact that in some parts of Britain \u2013 including the Midlands, the Gatwick hub and south Wales \u2013 new sorting machinery and working practices have successfully been introduced. London, the union's strongest centre, is also its most militant, as symbolised by the giant Mount Pleasant sorting office, the world's largest after Chicago, so big that a newly divorced postie (so legend has it) lived there undetected for six months. Management wants post workers who finish their delivery round early to come back and help sort; reasonable though it may be, it's a recipe for slower deliveries of the Mail's 75m items a day. Each side blames the other for delaying modernisation, which has already cost 40,000 jobs and could cost more as losses mount and unfunded pension obligations (\u00a34bn? \u00a310bn?) serve as reminders of the investment which should have come during the fat years of profit. Instead successive governments diverted the money to the Treasury. Governments have also dithered over the best means to catch up with productivity achieved in Europe, Mandelson's Brown-backed part-privatisation defeated last summer by a combination of stroppy Labour MPs (140 rebelled) and a recession-struck lack of a buyer. But Labour is in power and will take the blame for disrupted pre-Christmas services. EU competition policy and inept tinkering by the regulator, Postcom, must also take their share of blame for helping to put a once-thriving and popular state monopoly into intensive care, with medical staff fighting over the body."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
