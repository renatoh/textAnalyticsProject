Rumours have long surrounded Houston and Crawford, who made the revelations in her memoir, A Song for You: A Life with Whitney Houston, and in an interview with NBC News to air in full on 11 November. \u201cIn the early part of that friendship, it was physical,\u201d Crawford told NBC. \u201cIt was during that first summer that we met, was the first time our lips touched. And it wasn\u2019t anything planned, it just happened. And it felt wonderful. And then, not long after that, we spent the night together. And that evening was the night that we touched. And that just brought us closer.\u201d \u201cWe never talked about labels, like lesbian or gay,\u201d Crawford writes in her memoir. \u201cWe just lived our lives and I hoped it could go on that way forever.\u201d But Houston soon ended the physical side of their relationship. \u201cShe said we shouldn\u2019t be physical any more, because it would make our journey even more difficult,\u201d Crawford writes. \u201cShe said if people find out about us, they would use this against us, and back in the 80s that\u2019s how it felt.\u201d Houston went on to marry R&amp;B star Bobby Brown in 1992, with whom she had a famously fractious relationship. They divorced in 2006. Prior to her marriage, Houston had become friends with actor Eddie Murphy; in her memoir, Crawford claims Houston was eager for a relationship with Murphy, and was hurt when he failed to show up for a date they had planned. Crawford also claims Murphy called Houston on the morning of her wedding \u201cto say she was making a mistake, but she pressed ahead.\u201d Murphy has not commented on the claim, and has previously claimed the pair were friends but never dated. Houston died in 2012, drowning in a bathtub with a coroner also citing \u201ceffects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use\u201d. Brown said in 2016: \u201cI really feel that if Robyn was accepted into Whitney\u2019s life, Whitney would still be alive today \u2026 She didn\u2019t have close friends with her any more.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
