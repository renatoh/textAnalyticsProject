The Ordnance Survey mapping agency will today announce the first release of a product allowing non-profit making organisations to display their own data on OS maps for free. Until now, charities and private individuals republishing OS data have been required to negotiate licences if they want to stay on the right side of the law. Ordnance Survey's OpenSpace product is a \"slippy map\" interface, a piece of software that allows users to place any kind of information with a geographic reference over a map displayed on the web. Maps available through the service range from the 1:1m outline of Great Britain, up to street level (1:10,000). \"It provides you with all the necessary functionality to interact with a map such as panning, zooming and adding markers and polygons,\" the agency says. Users will need no special knowledge of geographic information system software. OS says it expects users to include \"neo-geographers\" who see the web as the best way to deliver or collect geographic information, and other web developers who see geographic information as a way of improving their applications. OpenSpace appears to offer a way out of some of the most vociferous disputes at the heart of the free data campaign - the obstacles faced by individuals and non-profit organisations wanting to re-use data produced by quasi-commercial government agencies. Last summer, a report commissioned by the Cabinet Office identified such difficulties as a barrier to the knowledge economy. The Power of Information review said that \"by virtue of their status as individuals or organisations wishing only to experiment, not build final products ready for market, they often do not have the resources to pay for expensive data\". The review found that government organisations \"have found it difficult to engage with small numbers of individual developers\". It called on the government to make data freely available for non-profit uses, and singled out OpenSpace by urging its launch by the end of the year. OS says it has met that deadline: \"We are delivering what we said we would deliver.\" However, tomorrow's \"alpha launch\" is to a small group of web developers; general release is scheduled for next year. Initial reaction was mixed. Andrew Hudson-Smith of University College London, whose Virtual London project foundered on the difficulty of licensing OS data, said: \"It is good news, but perhaps too little too late. Users and developers will initially be sceptical as the OS needs a serious public relations drive to get back all those users - and more importantly, developers - who have lost faith in them over the past couple of years.\" OpenSpace may also encounter grumbles from commercial businesses paying licence fees for the same data. The Power of Information review found that consumers already licensing mapping data \"strongly objected to the idea of similar information being given away for free to others, even on a non-commercial basis\". Ordnance Survey said: \"As the national mapping agency, we want to maximise the use of geographic information and serve the web developer community alongside our other customers and business partners. We are genuinely excited to see what the developer community can do with the data.\" \u00b7 Join the debate at the Free Our Data blog: freeourdata.org.uk/blog"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
