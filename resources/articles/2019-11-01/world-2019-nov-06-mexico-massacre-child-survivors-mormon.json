One of the survivors, 13-year-old Devin Langford, hid his six surviving siblings in bushes near the road, and set out walking to raise the alarm. But when he failed to return \u2013 and with night drawing over the mountainside \u2013 his nine-year-old sister McKenzie, headed into the wilds in search of him \u2013 even though she had been shot in the wrist. Shocking new details of the attack in which three women and six children were killed emerged on Wednesday, making plain the horror unleashed on the Mexican-American Mormon family \u2013 and piling fresh pressure on Mexico\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, to confront organized crime. \u201cOur cry for help is being listened to now,\u201d Adri\u00e1n LeBar\u00f3n, father of Rhonita LeBar\u00f3n and grandfather of four of the children killed, told the Televisa network on Wednesday. \u201cMy feeling, though, is that if we hadn\u2019t gone to the place it happened \u2013 if we hadn\u2019t shouted and talked \u2013 then the bodies would still be there.\u201d LeBar\u00f3n was speaking from the community of La Mora near the border between the states of Sonora and Chihuahua where he was preparing funeral services for the murdered members of the family who mostly belong to a breakaway branch of the Mormon religion. The three women and their 14 children from the Langford, Miller and Johnson families were traveling in three SUVs from a small village in Sonora to meet relatives in neighboring Chihuahua state. LeBar\u00f3n\u2019s daughter and her four children were all in a Chevrolet Tahoe which was attacked at 9.40am on Monday, the Mexican army\u2019s chief of staff said on Wednesday. Gen H\u00e9ctor Mendoza said all five were killed immediately and the vehicle burst into flames. The two other vehicles were attacked 18 kilometers up the unpaved road at around 11am. Lafe Langford \u2013 a relative of the victims \u2013 told CNN that the occupants of the second car saw that the lead vehicle had been attacked and knew they were in danger. \u201cThey started grabbing the babies and trying to hide them \u2013 and all of a sudden bullets just rained down from above,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce the firing stopped, these men came down off the mountain and pulled all the kids out of the vehicle and basically told them to get out of there.\u201d The children managed to walk about 300 meters, taking turns to carry their eight-year old brother Cody, who had been shot in the jaw and the leg, before they decided to take cover, he said. After hiding the younger children, Devin, who was unharmed, then walked 23 kilometers back to his village to get help. At first the search parties were driven back by further gunfire. By the time they reached the site with an army escort, it was well after dark and the terrified and wounded children still there had been left alone for 10 hours. The rescuers also found an unharmed seven-month-old baby still in her carseat. McKenzie, who had set out to find Devin and walked 10 miles before getting lost in the dark, was not found until several hours later. At Wednesday\u2019s press conference Gen Mendoza said the initial investigation suggested that the family had been unwittingly caught in a turf battle between the La L\u00ednea cartel, based in Chihuahua, and a branch of the Sinaloa cartel, known as the Salazar, based in Sonora. Relatives, however, point out that their vehicles were well known in the area, and that one of the mothers was killed after she got out of the car with her hands above her head. \u201cI don\u2019t see how that can be confusion,\u201d Adri\u00e1n LeBar\u00f3n said in Wednesday\u2019s interview. The attack was the latest of a string of mass killings which have tested President L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s \u201chugs not bullets\u201d strategy of tackling the social roots of crime instead of confronting the cartels head-on. After the murder of US citizens, Donald Trump called on L\u00f3pez Obrador to launch a \u201cwar\u201d against the cartels, but the massacre also prompted criticism from the Mexican left. Film star Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, who endorsed L\u00f3pez Obrador in the run-up to his landslide election victory last year, tweeted on Tuesday that the president \u201cmust change the narrative\u201d or \u201cWhy the hell did we vote for you?\u201d The president, widely known as Amlo, argues that the clumsy militarized strategy attempted by his predecessors underpins the violence lacerating Mexico today, but he is also extremely keen to keep his relationship with Trump on good terms. On Wednesday, he tried to reconcile those two urges, saying that those calling for a tougher line against the cartels were indulging in \u201cfascist thinking\u201d \u2013 but going out of his way to not only thank Trump for his offers of help, but to also thank him for not trying to impose them. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say \u2018we are thinking of sending a team to Mexico\u2019 but \u2018We are here to help if you want us to,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said. \u201cThat is something we are very grateful for.\u201d However, he stopping short of endorsing Trump\u2019s rhetoric. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, sad, because children died. This is painful,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said. \u201cBut trying to resolve this problem by declaring a war? In our country, it\u2019s been shown that this doesn\u2019t work. This was a disaster.\u201d In his interview with CNN, Langford stressed that the experience of his family was all too familiar to many in Mexico \u2013 a country which now sees nearly 100 murders a day. \u201cThese things have happened to people throughout Mexico for years, and they\u2019ve never had the voice or support that we have,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
