The Northern Ford Premiership club gave their near neighbours a scare before going down 30-16, but two fans were ejected and plastic bottles thrown on to the pitch. \"It almost ruined the day and we're determined to get to the bottom of it,\" said Leigh's chairman Mike Nolan. The Rugby Football League is awaiting a report from the match commissioner Tony Brown before deciding whether to take action, but it is likely to leave the matter in Leigh's hands. Wigan's semi-final against Castleford will be played at Headingley on Saturday April 13 and the following day Leeds are to face St Helens at Wigan's JJB Stadium, where Saints beat Leeds 27-22 at the same stage last season before lifting the Cup at Twickenham. Paul Cullen's role in the rejuvenation of Whitehaven is to be rewarded with the Lancashire coaching job in this year's expanded two-match Origin series against Yorkshire. The former Warrington centre and assistant coach has steered the Cumbrians from the lower reaches of the Premiership to establish them as promotion contenders. He is known to have impressed David Waite, the Great Britain coach who hands out the Origin jobs in his role as international coaching coordinator. Cullen will replace Andy Gregory, who plotted Lancashire's 36-24 win at Headingley when the Roses battle was revived last year. Brian Noble, who guided Bradford Bulls to Super League and World Club titles, is to replace Lee Crooks as Yorkshire's coach. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
