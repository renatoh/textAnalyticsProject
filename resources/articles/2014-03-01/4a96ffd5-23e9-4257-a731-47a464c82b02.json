Robin van Persie tried the match-day programme before Manchester United's loss to Liverpool and found stirring words cannot compensate for anaemic performances on the pitch. Belatedly, but crucially, he delivered where and when it mattered against Olympiakos. He never has to talk to David Moyes again providing he keeps the United manager in a job. Yet another age-defying contribution from Ryan Giggs inspired a sea-change in quality, urgency and desire from United as they moved into the Champions League quarter-finals on a raucous night at Old Trafford. It needed the finishing touches and a show of responsibility from Van Persie, however, to restore belief in Moyes's reign and the partnership with Wayne Rooney that has shaped United's fortunes for better and worse this season. A hat-trick from Van Persie, the first by a United player in the Champions League since Michael Owen struck against Wolfsburg in 2009, provided the most convincing riposte to suggestions he has fallen out with the United manager and been alienated by the style of play. Giggs and Rooney were instrumental in the Dutch international's liberation. Their understanding will be added consolation to Moyes once the delirium and relief of the comeback has subsided. They, and the intensity of the United performance, have given the beleaguered Scot something to cling to. Prior to the second leg the disconnect between Rooney and Van Persie had been one of many problems to beset Moyes in his debut season at Old Trafford. His selection choices against the Greek champions showed that is not the only worry up front. Juan Mata's ineligibility, Adnan Januzaj's poor display against Liverpool on Sunday and Moyes's lack of faith in Javier Hern\u00e1ndez, Ashley Young and Shinji Kagawa limited his pool of reliable choices. He turned instead to Danny Welbeck and Antonio Valencia to complement the United attack in a game with potentially major ramifications for his future at Old Trafford. This was Welbeck's first start in nine games although, given United's improvement after he replaced Van Persie in the victory at West Bromwich Albion 10 days ago and the Dutch international's undistinguished form of late, he could consider himself unfortunate not to begin against Brendan Rodgers' team. Or fortunate, in hindsight. The absence of pace and aggression from United's attacking play has been glaring under Moyes, along with evidence of a cohesive strategy, but the introductions showed an immediate desire to remedy those weaknesses. Valencia was harshly penalised for a foul straight from kick-off as United surged at the Olympiakos defence. The opening set the tone, however, for the high-tempo display that their predicament demanded and Welbeck's speed down the left invited Giggs to thread the first of several telling long-range passes behind the visitors' rearguard. That first run was halted illegally by Kostas Manolas, prompting a flurry of needless bookings by the Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers, but Welbeck's and Valencia's willingness to stretch the Olympiakos defence proved highly effective. Patrice Evra vowed the Premier League champions would fight for their last hope of redemption from this sorry season and few epitomised that attitude better in the first half than the often maligned Valencia. The Ecuador international may have invited questions over his self-confidence by asking to be relieved of the No7 jersey that formerly belonged to Cristiano Ronaldo, among other United luminaries, but did not shirk any responsibility here. The impressive, wobbling shiner that erupted over his left eye after an aerial collision with Joel Campbell was testament to the commitment in the United ranks. A standing ovation for Valencia was hard-earned. That said, Moyes still desperately needed Van Persie and Rooney to rediscover the understanding that carried United to the title last season and, unusually for this campaign, he was not disappointed in that regard. Giggs was the source of a vastly-enhanced supply to the United attack on his 140th Champions League appearance but the two leading strikers had shown promising signs together before Van Persie's second goal on the stroke of half-time. Considering the pair passed to each other only once in Athens, and that from the kick-off that followed Olympiakos's opening goal, it was not asking much of two international strikers to improve their rapport. This was an unexpected, overdue throwback to last season. Rooney led by example all over the pitch, winning tackles on the halfway line, defensive headers inside his own penalty area, striking the post with a deft flick of the forehead and taking on players with the drive of old. Van Persie read the No10's intentions throughout and, having confidently buried the penalty he won after a foolish shove in the back from Jos\u00e9 Holebas, was on hand to slot Rooney's low cross beyond Roberto to level the scores on aggregate. A similar routine almost delivered earlier in the game when Rooney delivered quick and low for Van Persie who, under pressure and at full stretch, was unable to connect cleanly. The England international's confident run and pass led to the foul on Welbeck that enabled Van Persie to claim his hat-trick from the resulting free-kick, curled down the middle of Roberto's goal with the keeper strangely rooted to the spot. The strikers have delivered only fleetingly this season but here, when it mattered most to their manager, they gave a telling reminder of what Moyes and United have been missing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
