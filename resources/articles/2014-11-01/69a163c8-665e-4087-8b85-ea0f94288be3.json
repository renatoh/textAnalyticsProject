The Pumas were decidedly off the pace but the key to this first Murrayfeld win over Argentina since 1990, according to the debutant in the side, was a return to a high-tempo style of play. Yet, after struggles under the Scot Frank Hadden, the Englishman Andy Robinson and the Australian Scott Johnson, it is the New Zealander Vern Cotter who has apparently brought a change of focus. He sought the advice of former Scotland players and coaches Andy Irvine, Jim Telfer and Ian McGeechan, and then shared his thoughts on a style of play with the players. The centre Mark Bennett believes that fuelled Saturday\u2019s performance. \u201cIn the squad there has been a sort of realisation that we were going away from the Scottish way,\u201d said the 21-year-old. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to bring that back, looking at our roots and the heritage of our game. We\u2019re bringing back that fire that was maybe slightly lacking before. Vern has fuelled that, bringing in his style and speaking to these guys and trying to find the Scottish way of playing, and we found that against Argentina.\u201d Bennett, who played under Cotter in the Clermont Auvergne youth system, was not one of the five try-scorers against the Pumas but was a crucial component in Scotland\u2019s early dominance as forwards and backs linked well and possession was maintained through a high tempo that sucked in defenders and created space for others. The Ayrshire lad would have had a try had his Glasgow team-mate Jonny Gray executed a two-on-one and released him but Bennett agreed that error in an otherwise outstanding display by the lock was typical of a team performance that showed plenty of positives but also aspects requiring work. Scotland had responded to a gift of a score for the pacy Argentina flanker, Javier Ortega Desio, in only the second minute with quickfire tries from Richie and Jonny Gray that exploited the sin-binning of Juan Imhoff for a late hit and provided a long-awaited Scotland finish to slick buildup play. The scrum-half Greig Laidlaw was the deserved man of the match behind an impressive pack and it was his rejuvenated breaking ability that created tries for Sean Maitland before half-time and Stuart Hogg just after, which, when added to Laidlaw\u2019s conversions and a penalty, put Scotland 34-10 ahead and killed the game as a contest. What happened next should tax the minds of players and coaches as Scotland slipped off the pace, 14 replacements entered the fray and Argentina seized their chance to restore some pride. Scotland lost forwards Rob Harley and Jim Hamilton to yellow cards as pressure mounted and the penalty count rose, and Argentina scrummaged to a penalty try and maintained pressure for the replacement scrum-half Tom\u00e1s Cubelli to cross twice in the final five minutes. An interception score by Tommy Seymour before the final double ensured Scotland were never in danger of losing but the final score took the gloss off what could easily have been a record victory. Memories of a six-try 42-17 win over Japan at this point last year being followed by a 28-0 thumping from the Springboks, should also focus minds as New Zealand pitch up in Edinburgh. \u201cThey\u2019re very pleased with the effort and the result,\u201d Cotter said, \u201cbut we\u2019re in no position to get carried away. The All Blacks beat England and they\u2019re the best team in the world. \u201cWe\u2019ll take a very positive approach to the game against the All Blacks \u2026 and how the game unravels will be important to us because we\u2019re going to get something from this game. \u201cBut the first thing we must do is not get carried away: be brutally honest with ourselves, which I know these guys are, try and develop what we did well and try to identify a few things which they\u2019ll be trying to exploit, and take those opportunities away from them.\u201d Sam Hidalgo-Clyne has been drafted into the squad as cover for Henry Pyrgos, the replacement scrum-half suffering concussion amid the Puma fightback, but the experienced Chris Cusiter will step up to the bench on Saturday if Pyrgos is ruled out.
