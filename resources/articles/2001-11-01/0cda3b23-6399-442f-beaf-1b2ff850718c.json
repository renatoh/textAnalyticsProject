But perhaps one of the worst was the view of the 1968 board of directors that Bobby Robson did not have what it took to be a successful manager. Eight months after putting him in charge, the club to whom Robson gave 12 years' service as a player sacked him, his bitterness hardened by the fact that he learned of his demise from a newspaper billboard as he crossed Putney Bridge. Thirty-three years later Robson returned to Craven Cottage for the first time as one of the game's most successful managers. And once again Fulham turned him over. On this occasion Robson did not see the writing on the wall, coming into the game convinced that, after two victories in a row including an impressive defeat of Aston Villa, his top-four team would win again. But though Craven Cottage has barely changed since Robson's last visit, the club is building something modern and impressive on the pitch. At last Fulham are looking like a side that had \u00a330m spent on them in the summer as they notched a third successive win. Their second goal was a delight, the culmination of a sweet passing move that seemed specially laid on in honour of Robson's old midfield mucker Johnny Haynes, the chief guest of the day. But it was another ghost from the past who undid Newcastle. Louis Saha, rejected by United after going on loan there two years ago, scored Fulham's first, was instrumental in their second and, having not found the net since August, looked again like the player who finished the First Division's top scorer last season. Saha was reluctant to give the credit for his turnaround to his new yellow hair - asked why yellow he said: \"I want maybe to play for Sweden\" - instead praising Alan Shearer for his advice during that short stay in the north. The former England captain must have wished he had kept quiet. On 20 minutes Saha broke the deadlock with a long-range special that bent into the top corner. Then, confidence soaring, Saha cleverly found John Collins on the left and threaded the return pass inside the full-back for the right winger Sylvain Legwinski to make it 2-0. After a promising start, Newcastle were struggling. Their passing game spluttered and, with their two most creative players Nolberto Solano and Laurent Robert largely anonymous, they resorted to hopeful high balls that Edwin van der Sar plucked out the air with ease. When Newcastle did get back into the game after Fulham allowed Gary Speed to head home unmarked, Barry Hayles almost immediately restored Fulham's advantage with a close-range header. Shearer missed a dubiously awarded penalty but Blaydon's favourites were rarely at the races. Newcastle would have gone joint top on points had they won. But to contend they need to improve their invention and defending. As for Robson he was applauded warmly by the home crowd but once again left Craven Cottage puzzled: Newcastle have not won in London in their past 27 visits. Man of the match : Louis Saha (Fulham)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
