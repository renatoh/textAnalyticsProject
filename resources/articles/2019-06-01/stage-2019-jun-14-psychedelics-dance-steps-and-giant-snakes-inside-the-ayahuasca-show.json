Trying out steps, exploring a chosen theme or taking the cast into the countryside to ingest a powerful hallucinogen? It was the last approach for Peruvian director Oscar Naters and his company Grupo Integro in the creation of Ino Moxo, a piece of visual theatre inspired by C\u00e9sar Calvo\u2019s 1981 novel The Three Halves of Ino Moxo, about a trek into the Amazon to visit a revered ayahuasca shaman. Ayahuasca is an astringent-tasting plant used in traditional healing that has powerful psychoactive effects. All of Naters\u2019 performers had experienced ayahuasca before joining the cast, but they took part in rituals together in preparation for the show, which hopes to go some way to recreating their multisensory experience through a combination of visuals, sound, movement and ritual, making the audience part of the ceremony. The cast includes Rawa, a shaman, or onaya, as they\u2019re called by his people, the Shipibo-Conibo from eastern Peru. Rawa comes from a family of traditional healers and took ayahuasca for the first time aged 11 with his father and grandfather. In the performance, he provides the medicinal chants (icaros) that are crucial to the ritual. \u201cThe chant vibrations are what penetrate and cure the patients\u2019 bodies,\u201d says Naters. \u201cEven at a molecular level such vibrations transform matter.\u201d People go to ayahuasca ceremonies for spiritual as well as physical healing. \u201cThe plant knows why you\u2019re drinking ayahuasca, what you\u2019re searching for,\u201d says Naters. \u201cThe plant will help you find those emotional knots or bottlenecks that we all have.\u201d The first response to ingesting ayahuasca is often violent vomiting, but that gives way to changed states of mind. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly hallucination because it\u2019s completely connected with you, your memory, your knowledge, your family,\u201d says Naters. Although visions of huge snakes are also common, he adds. \u201cYou can be terrified,\u201d says Naters, \u201cbut it\u2019s the way the medicine connects with the spirit of Mother Earth.\u201d Calvo\u2019s novel is concerned with the exploitation of the Amazon\u2019s resources and the importance of honouring nature. \u201cIn some rituals, the plant allows you to connect with animal or plant spirits from the rainforest,\u201d says Naters. \u201cRawa was mentioning that once he was really in touch with the spirit of water, and the ayahuasca was showing him how important water is for plants, from the inside.\u201d On another occasion, Rawa says he was able to enter a dimension where he was in the presence of his ancestors. \u201cThe plant allows you to enter this collective consciousness, allowing you to sort of travel in time and sense things that happened in different eras, for a few seconds,\u201d he says. Ayahuasca has become a popular activity for backpackers seeking adventure or enlightenment (the comedian Simon Amstell has said it cured his depression) but concerns were raised when a British tourist died after taking ayahuasca in 2014. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to give the respect that the plant deserves,\u201d says Rawa. \u201cPreparation in terms of the proper diet is crucial [which involves cutting out salt, sugar and meat]. Then it\u2019s important to be clear of your intentions. I welcome people from all over the world who have this passion and willingness to search for answers, but this is not just another drug experience. If you come thinking that way the plant might feel it is disrespectful and show you things that are too strong for you. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to know with whom you\u2019re planning to have a ceremony,\u201d adds Rawa. \u201cThis has become so popular, so commercialised, that now there are a lot of people who are not well prepared, just making a business out of it, they don\u2019t know enough to be leading ceremonies.\u201d Producer Bruno Paino chips in: \u201cThere\u2019s no TripAdvisor review of the best shamans in the Amazon.\u201d Going to see Ino Moxo may be a less risky way of getting an insight into the ayahuasca ritual. \u201cWe try to connect the Amazonian history that Calvo writes about with the experience of shamanic agony and healing in which the spectators themselves become characters deeply involved in the transpersonal drama of death and rebirth,\u201d says Naters. It sounds intense. \u201cWe hope so!\u201d says Naters. \u201cHere in Peru, even people in the audience who\u2019d never tried ayahuasca, they [felt] really alleviated after the show.\u201d Could catharsis await? Ino Moxo is at the Purcell Room, Southbank Centre, 15-16 June, as part of Border Crossings\u2019 Origins festival."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
