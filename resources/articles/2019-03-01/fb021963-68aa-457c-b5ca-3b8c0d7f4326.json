A woman comes in and habitually picks up the Grafton Daily Examiner. \u201cWhy do they have to go and put that on the front?\u201d she grumbles. \u201cThat\u2019s all we\u2019ll ever be known for again.\u201d Grafton is an unremarkable Australian country town, known primarily for the late-spring bloom of its purple jacaranda trees. It is now, however, the focus of global attention after a local, Brenton Tarrant, allegedly carried out a mass shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, that killed 50 and injured scores more. Former friends, neighbours and others have searched their memories for warning signs, hints that might have foretold his apparent radicalisation. More than a dozen Grafton residents described Tarrant as introspective and reserved. But few could point to little other than a normal upbringing. \u201cHe [Tarrant] was certainly introverted, quiet,\u201d a family friend said. \u201cHe could get really focused on things, like the gym. But I didn\u2019t really think he was political or anything like that. When you think back, he did travel alone for a long, long time.\u201d Tarrant left Australia to travel in 2011, aged 20, shortly after his father, an elite athlete who represented Australia, died of cancer. Although he returned briefly to Grafton in 2017, catching up with former friends and visiting his mother, a popular school teacher, no one recalled any warning signs. It appears that Tarrant was alone for most of the eight years he spent travelling, an odyssey that took him through much of Asia and Europe \u2013 Spain, Portugal, France, Romania but also the Balkans where, between 2016 and 2018, he visited historic sites and seemingly studied battles between Christians and the Ottoman empire. Counter-terrorism authorities in Hungary have suggested Tarrant also visited there while Bosnian media have reported a 2017 trip. The video of the Christchurch attack featured a nationalist Serb song from the Bosnian war of 1992-95 that glorifies former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107, convicted of genocide and war crimes against Bosnian Muslims. Tarrant\u2019s travels prompted a radical transformation in his outlook. A two-month window \u2013 April to May 2017 \u2013 appears notably influential. According to a \u201cmanifesto\u201d linked to Tarrant, 7 April changed him for ever. That day a terror attack in Stockholm, Sweden, killed five people including an 11-year-old girl. \u201cI could no longer turn my back on the violence,\u201d the 74-page document says. The following month the document states that Tarrant was in France during the country\u2019s general election and became obsessed with what he termed \u201cinvaders\u201d. An unnamed town in east France, around the size of Grafton, prompted disquiet. \u201cI watched a stream of the invaders walk through the shopping centre\u2019s front doors,\u201d the document states. Experts believe it is highly likely that Tarrant, 28, would have been influenced by the ideology of the far-right \u201cidentitarian\u201d movement, an online grouping of literate, anti-Muslim twentysomethings that had formed in France the previous year, 2016. \u201cFrance is the home of identitarian ideas \u2013 he could not have avoided them at the time,\u201d said Simon Murdoch, a researcher from anti-fascist charity Hope not Hate. Tarrant\u2019s document contains repeated references to the extreme ideas, language and themes espoused by the identitarian movement \u2013 or G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Identitaire (GI). His title \u2013 The Great Replacement \u2013 reflects an identitarian trope, lamenting what they claim is the replacement of European culture with non-European. Another of its major themes is ethnopluralism, the neo-fascist vision where regions are divided by ethnicity. \u201cThe ideology that G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Identitaire subscribes to is writ through what he\u2019s putting forward [in the document],\u201d said Murdoch. Within hours of the Christchurch killings, a group calling itself \u201cNew Zealand\u2019s premier Identitarian movement\u201d announced it was immediately \u201cceasing operations\u201d, although there is no evidence it was linked to Tarrant. Similarly, there is no proof Tarrant was an official Identitarian member. A former prominent member told the Observer he could not recall his name cropping up, though experts say the movement\u2019s potency lies in its capacity to disseminate extremist ideology online. In Grafton, a largely white town with an 8.7% Indigenous Australian population but no declared Muslims among its 18,600 residents, the feeling of shock has fast become a defensive instinct. Many residents are uneasy that they have now become associated with Tarrant. Most of his family and friends have closed ranks. At the town\u2019s showgrounds, Saturday is market day for Lauren Noordhof, who sells live chickens. Like many locals, she loves Grafton. \u201cWe have the most amazing jacaranda festival here in October; just the way the community comes behind people is just amazing. We\u2019re a really community-oriented town.\u201d Noordhof said she had been shocked to hear about the Christchurch attack. \u201cWhy would you do that to someone else? All those people who aren\u2019t going home to their loved ones tonight. But it\u2019s not about Grafton, it\u2019s anywhere. Why is there so much violence?\u201d \u2022 Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day. In New Zealand, the crisis support service Lifeline can be reached on 0800 543 354.
