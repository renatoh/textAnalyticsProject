Pompeo reiterated that the US believes it was \u201cunmistakable\u201d that Iran was responsible for the attacks, in an interview with Fox News Sunday. He stressed a need for diplomacy and said American officials are reaching out to their foreign counterparts. \u201cPresident Trump has done everything he can to avoid war. We don\u2019t want war,\u201d he added. The president has been accused of beating the drum of war with recent inflammatory statements against Iran. Pompeo said intelligence officials have \u201clots of data, lots of evidence\u201d tying Iran to alleged attacks on two oil tankers traveling near the Strait of Hormuz, a transit route for Arab oil shipments to Asia. He gave no details. He said that Washington will guarantee free navigation through vital shipping areas. \u201cThe United States is going make sure that we take all the actions necessary, diplomatic and otherwise that achieve that outcome,\u201d Pompeo said. US-Iran tensions are high following accusations by the Trump administration that Tehran carried out attacks last Thursday on the two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. Iran has denied having any role. \u201cThe intelligence community has lots of data, lots of evidence. The world will come to see much of it,\u201d said Pompeo, who headed the Central Intelligence Agency before becoming secretary of state. Pompeo said he did not want to discuss possible next steps the United State might take in response to last week\u2019s developments. \u201cIran will not get a nuke weapon. That\u2019s the goal,\u201d he said when asked about the possibility of Trump sending more US troops and military hardware to the region. \u201cI made a number of calls to colleagues around the world yesterday. I am confident that we will have partners that understand this threat,\u201d Pompeo said. Pompeo\u2019s comments came after the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, spoke publicly for the first time since a second attack on Saudi oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, blaming its arch-rival Iran and vowing that Saudi Arabia \u201cwon\u2019t hesitate to deal with any threat\u201d to the kingdom\u2019s interests. According to an interview for the pan-Arab daily Asharq al-Awsat, published on Sunday, Prince Mohammed said: \u201cWe do not want a war in the region \u2026 But we won\u2019t hesitate to deal with any threat to our people, our sovereignty, our territorial integrity and our vital interests.\u201d The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said on Sunday Britain was \u201calmost certain\u201d Iran was behind the oil tanker attacks, adding that London did not believe anyone else could have done it. Hunt said: \u201cThe great risk of the situation we are in is both sides in this dispute think the other would not want a war.\u201d The Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg criticized the Trump administration\u2019s statements on Iran on Sunday. \u201cWhat we see out of the White House is something disturbingly reminiscent of the kind of accelerating drumbeat that got us into the war in Iraq,\u201d he said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. Buttigieg also said on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation that while \u201c there is certainly concern that this is consistent with a pattern of malignant behavior by Iran\u201d, he worried \u201cthis appears to be part of an escalation where this administration might be leading us on a path to war that could get away from this White House very quickly. \u201cLook, it \u2013 it is nothing new for Iran to be acting in destabilized, destabilizing ways in their region,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cWe see it quite a bit. The question is what are we going to do to make things more stable before the situation becomes uncontrollable.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
