Vogts had wanted to play his former employers away first, but said there was nothing he could do to prevent the tie taking place at Hampden Park in June next year. \"We would have preferred to play them in Germany first, but they are first in the ranking and tell us what to do,\" said Vogts. The Scots will travel to Germany on September 10 next year for the second-last qualifier, by which time Vogts, who led Germany to victory in the 1996 European final at Wembley, would hope to be in at least second place in what is otherwise a relatively straightforward group. Scotland will start with two away trips, to the Faroe Islands on September 7 and to Iceland on October 12, and finish by entertaining Lithuania on October 11 2003. The Scottish Football Association chief executive David Taylor was also unhappy but said the draw did have benefits. \"It was not exactly what we were looking for,\" he said. \"But the most important thing was not to get Germany in our last game, especially away.\" The Professional Footballers' Association has rejected proposals from the Premier League over a new standard contract for players which would enable clubs to fine them up to four weeks' wages. Talks involving the Premier League, Football League and the PFA, as well as the Football Association, have been taking place in recent weeks following a spate of high- profile off-field incidents involving Premiership players. \"To say there could be no limit whatsoever on fines is too draconian,\" said the PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor. \"If they're really serious about this they should consider suspensions without pay.\" The PFA is concerned about the effect of increased fines on players in the lower divisions and would prefer to see clubs take more responsibility for misbehaviour.
