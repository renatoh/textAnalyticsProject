The heyday of the settlement movement, a mission by the educated middle class to set up centres of practical help in poor industrial areas, staffed by students and graduates, was over. By the 1960s Toynbee, once a beacon among settlements, lacked funds. Its Whitechapel buildings were crumbling, its educational programme largely disbanded and, in an institution where Charles Booth and William Beveridge had probed social problems, research abandoned. Walter saw how this Victorian pile could be transformed into a hub for local social work, national initiatives and international aid efforts, so he set about, with his second wife, Maisie, to identify key relations with local and national decision-makers. The result was a massive programme of education and skills retraining. Soon after becoming warden, Walter accepted the services of a volunteer, offering his help in any capacity, \"even sweeping the floor\". He was John Profumo, who had resigned from Harold Macmillan's cabinet in 1963 in spectacular circumstances. This duo of a former Conservative secretary of state for war and a pacifist succeeded in realising their visions for Toynbee - and in so doing rehabilitated Profumo's reputation. Walter's track record in developing services and creating research projects, often in collaboration with institutes in the US, was extraordinary. Ambitious politicians visited Toynbee, and Walter's concern for financial viability meant that, with Profumo's assis tance, the settlement again attracted support. Walter was born in Ferozepore, India, the son of an army sergeant major. He was six years old when the family settled back in Britain, and he attended the Royal Liberty school, Romford, Essex. Walter resolutely pursued the principle of simplicity. In the 1930s he participated in social and political alternatives: community living, trade unionism, Quakerism and pacifism. He also obtained an economics degree through night classes at the London School of Economics, and so entered academia in the late 1940s. This provided him with a platform from which to initiate his radical strategies for tackling poverty. Focusing on development economics, he contributed to the academic programmes at three universities in Africa, one in the United States, and two in the Britain. His book An Introduction To Economics (1952) was translated into many languages and used by generations of undergraduates. His proposals on development routes for new nations influenced Kwame Nkrumah's government in Ghana, and other key African figures; they were also adopted by the World Council of Churches and the British government. The years at Toynbee, from 1964 to 1972, were a break from academia and one of the most fruitful periods of his career. They showed that the educator, combining his knowledge with managerial skills, was a devastatingly effective practitioner. He then spent time at the University of Cape Coast, Ghana, before concluding his academic career as professor of economics at the University of Lesotho. Walter was an activist who used intellect, passion and charm to plant subversive proposals in the heart of the establishment, and he will be cherished by many people for the help he gave them. Whether approached by a resident, fugitive, neighbour or tramp, Walter would do what he could imaginatively and immediately: provide a bed, food, work, money - as a gift, never a loan - tuition, contacts, influence, advice, or just an empathetic ear. He had the same style of influence and debate with everyone, and would, if it was necessary, devote hours of persuasion to ensure an evolutionary approach to social change. He was predeceased by his first wife and is survived by Maisie; by a son and a daughter from his first marriage; and by two sons and one daughter from the second. \u00b7 Walter Birmingham, academic and administrator, born January 4 1913; died August 16 2004."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
