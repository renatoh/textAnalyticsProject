The Senegal striker\u2019s return to first-team action \u2013 and goalscoring \u2013 following his recovery from a broken kneecap has helped Alan Pardew keep his job and the manager is praying Ciss\u00e9 will pass a fitness test to face Tottenham. \u201cPapiss hasn\u2019t trained all week,\u201d said Pardew, whose side recorded their first Premier League win at Leicester\u2019s expense last weekend. \u201cHe has a slight problem with his knee but it\u2019s nothing to do with the prevous injury. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything major.\u201d It does not help that Emmanuel Rivi\u00e8re, Ciss\u00e9\u2019s understudy, is also a doubt as is Pardew\u2019s key defensive midfielder Cheik Tiot\u00e9. Siem de Jong, Rolando Aarons and Davide Santon are definitely sidelined. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got a crisis but we have one or two we are waiting on \u2013 Papiss, Tiot\u00e9, Rivi\u00e8re,\u201d Pardew said. \u201cPapiss being fit is very important to us and we are sweating a little bit but I am not ruling anyone out at this stage.\u201d Pardew has at least been encouraged by the atmosphere among his fit personnel this week. \u201cThe mood in training has been much stronger,\u201d he said. \u201cOur resolve has grown and hopefully our confidence too. We\u2019ve had a couple of blows on the injury front but I definitely feel the confidence round the camp has improved.\u201d Even so Newcastle remain in the bottom three. \u201cResults have got to improve,\u201d said Pardew, who feels his players\u2019 morale was bolstered when Mike Ashley, the club\u2019s owner \u2013 who has remained loyal to his manager through considerable recent adversity \u2013 visited the dressing room and celebrated with them after the 1-0 win against Leicester at St James\u2019 Park. \u201cIt just shows that we\u2019re fighting on all fronts from the owner downwards,\u201d said Pardew. \u201cWe tried to emphasise to the players that it\u2019s very, very important that we get ourselves up the league and try to put a run of wins together.\u201d Pardew, probably more than anyone, is well aware there can be no cause for complacency in the wake of beating Leicester. \u201cI think every Premier League manager fears for his job these days,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to be on your guard and you have to get results. At the moment our results need to improve.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
