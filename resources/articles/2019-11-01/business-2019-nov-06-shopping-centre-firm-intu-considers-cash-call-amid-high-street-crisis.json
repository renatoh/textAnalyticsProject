The heavily indebted shopping centre operator said its like-for-like rental income had fallen by about 9% this year and would fall again next year owing to the tough retail climate. Intu blamed the declines in part on the company voluntary arrangements \u2013 an insolvency process used to reduce rent bills and close stores \u2013 used by Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia group and Monsoon Shares in Intu fell on Wednesday by 17% to just 33p on the back of the gloomy update. Its chief executive, Matthew Roberts said options on the table also included selling some of the company\u2019s assets in order to reduce its near-\u00a35bn debt pile. Intu had had a difficult four months, with the CVAs \u201cslightly worse than expected\u201d, he said. \u201cOur number one priority is to fix the balance sheet. We have a clear plan to do this \u2026 these options include disposing of assets, where we are in the advanced stages of selling two of our Spanish assets, through to raising equity, which is also likely to form part of the solution.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
