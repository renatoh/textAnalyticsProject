In fact it has tested one robotic hand, the RBO Hand 2, with two different robotic arms: the LBR iiwa14 and the Staubli RX160L (Ocado tests robot with soft touch to handle fruit, 1 February, page 22). \u2022 In a feature about Haneen Zoabi (\u2018Israel is not shocked by Trump\u2019, 31 January, page 12, G2), we said she was the first Israeli-Palestinian woman to be elected to the Knesset when she won a seat in 2009.
