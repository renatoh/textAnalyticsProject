But this strong sense of a pecking order of qualifications in the same subject does not as yet apply in further education. Could this change? At present, colleges teach qualifications that are devised and sold by external bodies, which is seen as a strength in some colleges. \"One of the things about the English FE system is that we have national qualifications,\" says David Croll, principal of Derby College. But some of his fellow principals disagree, and their views have been strengthened by the move in the bill going through parliament to allow colleges to award their own foundation degrees. Some colleges feel their reputation is so good that students and employers would prefer qualifications with their name on to the standard national variety, says Rob Wye, national director of the Learning and Skills Council. Whether colleges should be able to create their own awards which attract public funding is one of a range of issues that are to be covered in their bid to take more control of their own affairs. Tomorrow Sir George Sweeney, principal of Knowsley Community College, will take a set of broad proposals to the government on how to bring self-regulation to FE - not just to colleges but to private training firms and adult and community education organisations, too. This will hardly be a surprise to ministers since it was the education secretary, Alan Johnson, who last November challenged FE to \"develop a proposal for self-regulation\" by the spring. It was a shrewd move by Johnson. Talk of colleges getting more control had been gathering with the work headed by Sweeney to reduce bureaucracy. \"He was really saying that if we are not capable of coming up with a self-regulation system and can't accept the responsibility, we shouldn't be in the game,\" says Sweeney. He won't be putting concrete proposals on Johnson's desk when he presents the proposition worked out by a group of more than 30 representatives from colleges, training firms and other bodies. The sector has yet to be consulted on what sort of powers it wants, he says. But in broad terms, the proposition is that FE takes responsibility for such matters as adult vocational qualifications, complaints against institutions or individuals, quality improvement and policing financial probity. Ofsted would continue to scrutinise colleges and training organisations, though there would be more \"peer review\". \"I can't see the state giving up on inspection,\" says Wye. In the same way, no government is going to relinquish all control on how public money is spent by colleges. On the other hand, ministers might go with a suggestion to move some of the quangos set up to improve colleges within their control. The group favours the setting up of a new FE body, to include the Association of Colleges, the 157 Group and the Association of Learning Providers, among others, to make self-regulation work. Such a body could have the power to deal with complaints. And no doubt it will seek the power to exclude undesirable newcomers. For the first time, there might be rules on what constitutes a college. If there is anybody with an ambition to found a further education college, they had better get in quick."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
