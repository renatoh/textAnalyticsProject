Transport 0.5% The rising price of crude oil pushed up the cost of motoring, with petrol and diesel prices going up last month. However, transport was one of the few areas where prices went up less steeply over the year as the cost of European flights came down Communication 0.2% This sector had only a small upward effect on inflation mainly due to a small rise in the price of telephone equipment and services. Year on year, there was also a small increase because cable and mobile tariffs rose compared with sharp falls in the previous year Health 0.4% Prices of medical products, appliances and equipment, plus out-patient and hospital services, all contributed to a small monthly rise. However, there was a small downward effect after pharmaceutical products fell in price compared with the previous year Food 1.3% Overall, household food bills rose by more than last year. The main pressure on prices came from increases in meat, especially pork, which was up 7.4% and beef, which rose 4.2%. Prices for certain fruits, such as avocados, also went up steeply Alcohol 3.0% Alistair Darling's decision to increase excise duty on alcohol in his March budget has come back to haunt the government, with the ensuing rise in prices contributing to the increase in inflation. Beer went up 4p a pint while wine rose 14p and spirits 55p Energy 2.1% The cost of electricity and gas increased in the last month as the price of oil reached record levels on surging global demand. The rise in prices is also down to new tariff increases from some companies, compared to last year when average bills decreased Recreation 0.5% Only a small overall upward effect on the monthly inflation rate but figures show sharp rises over the past 12 months for game consoles and gardening items (left). The rises were offset by a fall in the prices of newspapers, books and stationery Restaurants 1.2% An increase in the cost of catering services was the main reason for the rise in prices in this sector. Prices rose in restaurants and cafes, with the main upward pressure coming again from the increase in duty on alcohol and owners facing higher costs for food What's down ... Household -1.3% Prices of furniture, household goods and routine maintenance fell last month due to discounting across a wide range of items Clothing -0.1% The cost of clothing and footwear for men, women and children dropped this month"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
