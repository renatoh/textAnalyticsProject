The yes vote for legalising cannabis finished with 48.4% of the vote, trailing the no vote on 50.7% \u2013 or just 67,662 votes out of 2.9m. In the lead-up to the October election polls showed a country divided, with support for legalising cannabis ranging between 30-50%. In the non-binding referendum, voters were asked to decide whether they wanted to pass a bill that would legalise cannabis and regulate how it is used and sold. This would have included producing and selling fresh and dried cannabis, including plants and seeds \u2013 for people over 20 years old. The change would also have imposed more stringent restrictions than the rules around sales of alcohol and tobacco. Andrew Geddis, a law professor at the University of Otago, said while there was no legal imperative for an incoming government to abide by the referendum result, it would be \u201cpretty hard for them not to act\u201d on the vote. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has repeatedly refused to state her position on cannabis but said she would let the public know how she had voted once the results were released. Ardern recently said she has used cannabis \u201ca very long time ago\u201d. Former Labour prime minister, Helen Clark, said cannabis prohibition \u201cdoesn\u2019t work\u201d and should be abandoned, a position echoed by many leading public health professionals. \u201cClearly, the prospect of invoking criminal sanctions has had little impact on people\u2019s behaviour,\u201d Clark wrote in a recent opinion piece for the Guardian. \u201cEvidence from longitudinal studies carried out in New Zealand indicates that by the age of 25, 80% of New Zealanders will have tried cannabis at least once. Put simply, prohibition-based policy approaches have not eradicated and will not eradicate cannabis consumption and supply in New Zealand or anywhere else where its use is established.\u201d Cannabis is New Zealand\u2019s most commonly used illicit drug, and the latest New Zealand Health Survey found that 15%, or 590,000 New Zealand adults used cannabis in the past 12 months. M\u0101ori account for 16% of New Zealand\u2019s population and are shown to be disproportionately affected by New Zealand\u2019s drug laws, facing three times as many arrests and prosecutions for possession of cannabis than non-M\u0101ori. Prof Papaarangi Reid, the head of the department of M\u0101ori health at the University of Auckland, has argued that legalisation would help control the potency of the drug, its price and make it less accessible to young people. \u201cWe\u2019re particularly concerned that M\u0101ori have borne the brunt of biased enforcement and the negative health effects of illegal cannabis,\u201d said Reid."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
