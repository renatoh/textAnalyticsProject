They are now unbeaten in their last 12 league games at Millmoor and could have emerged with more than a draw last night. Burnley, with enough talent available that they could afford to leave their \u00a31m signing Robbie Blake on the bench for an hour, were the latest to discover the spirit within Ronnie Moore's genuine team. Stan Ternent's promotion contenders rarely displayed the composure which was a feature of their excellent form earlier in the season and, after leading through a penalty, created little apart from a 70th-minute shot which Gareth Taylor dragged wide. Ian Moore was in his dad's bad books again after only nine minutes. The Burnley striker, who scored against the team managed by father Ronnie earlier this season, won a penalty when he was brought down by Martin McIntosh who was booked for protesting over the verdict. No doubt Ronnie brought up young Ian to be an honest lad, but the Rotherham manager appeared less than impressed by the way his youngster tumbled - and by the assistant referee's decision to signal a spot-kick which was tucked away by Taylor. The manager's mood was improved within two minutes, though, when the referee John Brandwood decided that Paul Weller had brought down his former Burnley team-mate Paul Mullin inside the area. This time, Kevin Ball was booked before Mark Robins equalised from the spot for Rotherham, who should have been ahead inside three minutes of the start when another former Burnley player, Alan Lee, failed to beat keeper Marlon Beresford. With Robins almost turning in a cross from Lee a minute later, it represented an enterprising start by the troubled Yorkshire club and they continued to trouble Burnley after the quickfire exchange of penalties. The home team retained the initiative after the break without making real inroads into the Burnley area, but Mullin did go close when he stabbed his 58th-minute shot wide from Chris Sedgwick's cross. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
