Jack Wilshere, clad in England training gear, was shifting uncomfortably in his chair as the conversation turned to recent criticisms from former players about his form and development. Where it had been Paul Scholes\u2019 withering assessment of his progress towards the end of last season, here the focus was on comments delivered by Jamie Redknapp and Jamie Carragher while picking the bones out of the opening weekend victory over Crystal Palace. The sense of deja vu was rather unnerving. Yet, where he had felt compelled to seek out Scholes last May and engage with a midfielder he had so admired, soaking up any knowledge he could in the process, there will be no attempt at reconciliation this time \u2013 particularly, it seems, with Redknapp, who in fairness was rather more glowing of the youngster\u2019s display against Besiktas in the Champions League qualifiers a week later. \u201cI listen to the people who I work closely with and, with all due respect, if anything Redknapp should have a little bit more, not \u2018respect\u2019 but \u2018sympathy\u2019,\u201d said Wilshere. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for someone to go on television and say: \u2018He should be doing this or that.\u2019 But, if you look back, he was injured just as much as I was. Maybe more. And he was never injured at my age as well and it does take a lot of mental strength [to come back]. \u201cSo to hear people go on TV and say: \u2018He\u2019s got to get fitter,\u2019 well, I don\u2019t need that. I listen to people like the boss here, Gary Neville, people who talk a lot of sense and can help me with my game. It doesn\u2019t \u2018hurt\u2019 me, hearing criticism from ex-players. It probably disappoints me a little bit more. I heard what Robbie Savage said and that was, if you like, the first ex-player to give me constructive criticism. I respected that. I\u2019ll take criticism. I know that\u2019s part and parcel of football. But when it\u2019s just reckless and aggressive, I don\u2019t listen.\u201d Those comments, delivered after Wilshere had been substituted 69 minutes into a game Arsenal went on to win in stoppage time, had reflected the 22-year-old\u2019s sluggish start to a campaign that must, surely, prove to be his breakthrough. Too many others, after all, have been blighted by the wrong kind of breaks. \u201cJack Wilshere\u2019s problem is Jack Wilshere,\u201d Redknapp had said. \u201cHe\u2019s not performing. He\u2019s got to take games by the scruff of the neck like two years ago. There are no excuses for this young lad any more.\u201d That is hardly revelatory and the youngster\u2019s frustration is born of the reality that he does not need reminding of. He is already acutely aware that, after so many false dawns, founded largely in a fragile body, he must take the opportunities ahead for club and country if he is to fulfil his potential. It will be a considerable challenge for him to hold down a regular place in the Arsenal side once Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s complement are fully fit and available. England, almost in contrast, have lost Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard since the summer and Wilshere, a player who made his debut over four years ago but still has only 21 caps, must fill the void and make his mark in Monday\u2019s opening Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland. That recurring ankle injury, with its associated aches and pains, is finally behind him. He has spoken to a psychiatrist at Arsenal who has drawn out some of the exasperation that had built up over wasted years. \u201cIt was the frustration,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019ve learned to enjoy my football while I can. Every time I\u2019m on the pitch I just enjoy it. I\u2019m not as aggressive, not as angry. \u201cIf something went wrong a couple of years ago I would have gone to the physio: \u2018Look, my ankle\u2019s not right.\u2019 Now I\u2019m on top of it, enjoying my football and I\u2019ve grown up. I realise things aren\u2019t going to go my way every week. Of course they\u2019re not. But the main thing is to give your all and enjoy. I\u2019ve worked with a psychologist at Arsenal and he\u2019s taught me that, if your head\u2019s not right, it can affect other parts of your body. So get that right and enjoy your football, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do. I would\u2019ve liked to have played over 250 games and, if I\u2019d been injury-free, I would\u2019ve. So in that respect I\u2019m not where I should be. But in terms of dealing with the injuries, adapting and accepting that, I\u2019m where I want to be.\u201d In that context photographs of him smoking while on holiday in Las Vegas this summer might have been considered untimely, particularly given he had spoken to Wenger after coverage of a similar incident last season. \u201cIf I smoked 20 a day and scored 20 a season, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been caught a couple of times but I\u2019m not a regular smoker. I\u2019m not reckless. I have two kids. I don\u2019t want them growing up thinking: \u2018Look at Daddy, he goes out all the time. He smokes.\u2019 I\u2019m not one of \u2018them\u2019. It\u2019s under control. I spoke with the boss after the first time and he was accepting, like \u2018I\u2019m French and I\u2019ve been on a team bus with French players who are smoking\u2019. And the second time it was: \u2018Look, come on, Jack. This is a big season for you.\u2019 I knew that already. \u201cI went on holiday and enjoyed it but as soon as I came back to pre-season training I said I\u2019d be fit and I have been. It is an important season for me not just for my country but for my club. I\u2019ve had a good pre-season, the first time in three or four years where I\u2019ve managed to do every single session. I\u2019ve stayed away from injury, trained here every day. I\u2019m fit and in the gym. It\u2019s a big season for me. There\u2019s no point in me saying: \u2018I\u2019ve got another year to develop.\u2019 I\u2019m 22 now. Look at Germany. Mario G\u00f6tze has won the World Cup and he\u2019s my age. It is time to deliver.\u201d Wilshere welcomed three World Cup winners back to Arsenal last month in Mesut \u00d6zil, Lukas Podolski and Per Mertesacker, with their presence offering constant reminders of what can be achieved through the strength of the collective. \u201cI asked Podolski who their best player was and he said: \u2018We didn\u2019t really have a Cristiano Ronaldo or a Lionel Messi. We were just a good team.\u2019 That\u2019s what they had. Don\u2019t get me wrong: they\u2019ve got world-class players but they work so well as a team and, when up against the Messis and Ronaldos, they came out on top because they worked together.\u201d Therein probably lies England\u2019s best hope of progression, with the development of a selfless, industrious team who play to their strengths. It is a process which will take time, but one in which Wilshere hopes to be integral. \u201cGermany won the World Cup and we went out in the group stages, so that\u2019s how far we are away from them,\u201d he added. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got Messi or Ronaldo but we have good players. The team\u2019s been broken up a little bit with Lamps and Gerrard going, so we\u2019re trying to work together as a team. We\u2019re moving in the right direction.\u201d Their progress will be tested in Basel on Monday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
