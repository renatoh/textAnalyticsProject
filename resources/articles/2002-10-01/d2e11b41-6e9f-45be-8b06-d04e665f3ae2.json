If Deirdre Madden's novel is a guide, the answer is a qualified no. Set in contemporary Dublin, Authenticity, her fifth novel (One By One in the Darkness, her fourth, was shortlisted for the Orange Prize), is a rich, insightful and authentic look at art and creativity. Its central theme is that talent requires responsibility in order to flourish. And if the celebrity gossip columns are to be believed, responsibility and talent rarely appear in the same person, which leaves the average artist in difficulty. Roderic Kennedy, the central character, is a case in point: his drinking, womanising and bad relationships constantly threaten his painting. Another main character, creatively repressed lawyer William Armstrong, is going through a midlife crisis: here's a case of what can happen when talent is not supported early on, but is crushed by a bullying parent. The experience warps William to such a degree that he becomes suicidal. Authenticity points out that William is partly to blame for his unhappiness but, crucially, it is his belated discovery of talent and the subsequent realisation of all the wasted years that finally pushes him over the edge. Ultimately, though, it is through Julia that the moral of the story emerges: an artist who does not trust her instincts is in personal and professional jeopardy. Young and just going professional, Julia has excellent instincts about people. When she first meets William on a park bench, she senses he is on the brink and goes out of her way to help him (and saves his life). In her good deed lies the novel's message of hope: the way out of artistic misery is through small acts of courage. However, Julia lets Roderic undermine her instincts, leaving her vulnerable and William without hope. William has good reason to be desperate: he despises his wife, sees himself reflected unflatteringly in his son, hates his life and regrets his years as a lawyer. It is solely on the basis of his friendship with Julia that he sets up a studio in his house where he tries to paint (and inadvertently confronts his deepest fears). But Roderic, a successful artist, Julia's unofficial mentor and eventually her lover, warns Julia off William: he has a bad feeling about him. 'Someone as devitalised and miserable as that needs energy. He'll take yours, if you give him half a chance. He'll suck you dry.' Julia, unfortunately for all, demurs to Roderic's charisma. Madden writes with impressive depth. Even so, there is a sense of reserve about the writing - for a novel about artists, the passion is consistently played down. And yet, it seems right for these characters to be a little cold and unfeeling, because that is who they are. So while the moments of connection are moving they are few and far between. That said, it is an extremely generous book: at once a cautionary tale against bad parenting, it is also a pitch-perfect depiction of the reality of the artistic life, and, no, it need not be all hand-wringing angst - provided you have the courage of your convictions, that is."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
