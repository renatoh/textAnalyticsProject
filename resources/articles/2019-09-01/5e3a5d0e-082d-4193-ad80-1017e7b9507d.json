The trio, Tanya Davies, the MP for Mulgoa, and legislative council members Matthew Mason-Cox and Lou Amato, said on Monday night they would back the spill motion, only months after Berejiklian led the party to victory at the election. But on Tuesday morning the spill was called off after the three claimed they had received \u201cfurther concessions\u201d on amendments to the bill. \u201cSince releasing our statement last night, we have received confirmation that further concessions will be forthcoming in relation to amendments to the Abortion Bill,\u201d Davies said in a statement. \u201cOn this basis I have called the Premier this morning and advised her that we will withdraw the spill motion to continue negotiations prior to the debate in the upper house commencing later today.\u201d Most senior Liberals have publicly backed the premier, but religious leaders, rightwing MPs and conservative media commentators have mounted a vociferous campaign to derail the legislation before the vote. Opponents claim the bill will allow so-called gender or sex selection and abortion \u201con demand\u201d up until birth. In a joint statement issued on Monday night, the MPs said they had consistently requested that the premier urgently intervene. \u201cWe have come to the conclusion that the right course of action is not to leave the parliamentary Liberal party but to hold the premier to account for presiding over this shameful process,\u201d they said in a statement published by News Corp. Davies has previously expressed her willingness to move to the crossbench over the premier\u2019s handling of the private member\u2019s bill. Moving a spill motion rather than defecting to the crossbench would allow the dissenting MPs to register their protest without endangering the government\u2019s thin majority in the 93-seat legislative assembly. The deputy premier, the Nationals MP John Barilaro, called the proposed challenge \u201cdumb\u201d and said the Coalition agreement was with Berejiklian as leader. The NSW environment minister, Matt Kean, ridiculed the spill motion, saying a challenge would be \u201clunacy\u201d. Senior Liberals lined up to denounce the spill proposal, including the treasurer, Dominic Perottet, attorney general Mark Speakman, the police minster, David Elliot, the transport minister, Andrew Constance, and the families and communities minister, Gareth Ward. Ward characterised the three MPs as an \u201carrogant\u201d fringe. \u201cThe reality is that this is an attempt by people who want to hold the rest of parliament over a barrel because they\u2019re not getting their way on a particular issue,\u201d he told ABC radio."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
