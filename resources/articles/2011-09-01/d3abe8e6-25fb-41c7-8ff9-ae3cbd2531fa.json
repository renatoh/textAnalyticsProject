Indeed, the progress of those four clubs this season will have a major impact on the financial fortunes of the other 16 clubs in the Premier League. That is because in the second half of this season the league's chief executive, Richard Scudamore, and the head of international broadcasting, Paul Molnar, are due to go to market for the sale of the 2013-16 international TV rights. Unlike the domestic deal, from which club payments are heavily weighted according to league performance, the international rights are shared equally between all 20 clubs. The performance of English clubs in the Champions League is an important driver of value for those international rights. The current deal, for which negotiations were under way in the 2008-09 season, brought record international revenues of up to \u00a3400m. During the season of those talks, Manchester United were the reigning European champions who made it to the Rome final, with two of the other three semi-finalists being Arsenal and Chelsea. Council helps Glamorgan The 2015 Ashes Test awarded to Sophia Gardens completes a public and sporting sector bailout of the financially stricken Glamorgan County Cricket Club. The England &amp; Wales Cricket Board has handed Glamorgan Tests against Australia and New Zealand and six one-day and Twenty20 matches. It was much needed. In February, Glamorgan's debts to the Allied Irish Bank had reached \u00a36.8m in loans and overdrafts, and almost \u00a32.2m was owed to the then chairman, Paul Russell. A month later they posted a \u00a3330,000 loss. Indeed, according to a report by the Cardiff council chief executive, Jon House, so acute had Glamorgan's cashflow issues become that they needed early payment of community sport grants to cover them. The House report was the basis for the council's decision to award Glamorgan more than \u00a31m of loans to help to cover a \u00a32.1m cost overrun in upgrading the Swalec Stadium to Test match standard. It also renewed its five-year grant-support programme for cricket in the community at \u00a3100,000 a year. House had commissioned Deloitte to carry out an independent report into the club's application for funding, and the accountant concluded there were more potential risks than potential upsides in extending the finance to Glamorgan. One of the key risks was described as: \"The club [failing] to secure the [projected] number and type of international cricket matches included in the business plan.\" Paradoxically, the decision to strip Cardiff of next year's West Indies Test \u2013 after Glamorgan failed to pay hosting fees for the \u00a31m-loss-making Sri Lanka five-dayer on time \u2013 may assist Glamorgan financially. West Indies would have made Glamorgan another loss. Russell says Glamorgan would not have collapsed without the Ashes Test. Even so, the ECB's handover of one of its most lucrative properties is a big help. Sky is the limit for Titans \"Titans of Cricket is a series of 3 amazing live cricket events with Freddie Flintoff and 15 other cricketing Titans competiting [sic] in four team [sic] this October, 2011,\" so blared some marketing blurb to the events slated to appear at the MEN Arena, the NEC and the O2 over the coming 10 days. Except it is not: two of the three dates have been cancelled. Ingenious Media, the venture-capital company behind the events, says this is not related to ticket sales but player availability. Indeed it will be putting on free coach travel for those ticketholders wishing to travel to the London event, where they will be able to sit in upgraded seats. Refunds are otherwise available. Although he is known as an investment adviser to the stars, Patrick McKenna, Ingenious's chairman, engaged a third-party organisation to take care of player recruitment. Its efforts are said to have suffered from late-season injuries to key players. Still, Andrew Flintoff and Adam Gilchrist will headline in the four-team event at the O2, which is coincidentally the only one that was scheduled to be broadcast live on Sky."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
