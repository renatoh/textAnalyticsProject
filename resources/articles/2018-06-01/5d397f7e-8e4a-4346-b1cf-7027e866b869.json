The 1-0 defeat here has checked English momentum, with Kane kicking his heels among the substitutes and his lead at the top of the tournament\u2019s scoring charts still at one goal, to leave Southgate\u2019s team confronting an awkward challenge at Spartak Stadium next week. The manager accepted the eight changes to his lineup \u2013 Belgium made nine \u2013 had left him open to criticism but insisted all his players bought into a tactic aimed at the bigger picture. \u201cThis was a game we wanted to win but the knockout is the biggest game for a decade for us and we had to make sure our key players were preserved,\u201d said Southgate, who saw Roy Hodgson\u2019s approach heavily scrutinised after he made six changes for the third group game at Euro 2016. \u201cYou have to look at the bigger picture sometimes and make decisions which, in some quarters, might be criticised. But everyone understands \u2013 in the dressing room and in the group \u2013 what we\u2019re trying to do. \u201cWith respect, in the Euros I think we were only ahead for a few minutes of any of the games. Here we\u2019ve played extremely well. We\u2019ve played well in the games leading into and at the tournament, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve played poorly at all tonight. We don\u2019t like losing and don\u2019t want to lose matches, but the primary objective from the evening we\u2019ve got. And if we\u2019d put Harry on for 10 minutes and someone had raked his ankle, that would have been ridiculous. The knockout game is the important one. \u201cOf course we have a responsibility to the supporters, and the support in the stadium was absolutely outstanding tonight. The support and encouragement from home has been brilliant. But when you\u2019re a leader and a manager, you have to make decisions which are right for your group to achieve the primary objective. Sometimes those decisions will be criticised. I understand that. But only one person makes that decision with all the full facts and managing a tournament in mind: physically, medically, tactically for the benefit of the group. I\u2019m entirely comfortable with the decision. Sometimes you have to make decisions for the bigger picture.\u201d Kane will return against Colombia with England\u2019s first-choice lineup now able to begin their preparations for Colombia, while those who featured here conduct recovery work back in Repino. Southgate allayed any fears that John Stones might have been injured after the defender sat out the second half with heavy strapping on a calf, suggesting the plan had always been to replace him with Harry Maguire at the break. Both will be available on Tuesday, when England, ranked 12th in the world, will confront a team ranked 16th who have found their feet in the tournament after successive wins. \u201cThey\u2019ve got some outstanding individuals but I believe it\u2019s a game we can win,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe feel we\u2019re a team who are improving. We have levels still to reach and work to do, but that\u2019s nothing we didn\u2019t already know. \u201cThat\u2019s not a bad thing. If we\u2019d won again tonight, the reality of where we are might not have been in people\u2019s mind. We know where we are. We know how immaculate we have to be to win matches against the best teams, and we have that challenge still to come. Whatever happens next week, the selection against Belgium was the right decision as far as I\u2019m concerned. People will say it is only the right decision if we win next week, but we\u2019re potentially going into a match with extra time having risked players here we didn\u2019t need to risk.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
