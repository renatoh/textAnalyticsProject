Busy with wildfowl in the winter, today it is occupied only by a pair of paddling mergansers. I make my way down the hill towards the old sheep pens and the narrow beach at the loch's edge. On the gritty sand is written the story of the morning's activity: sharp-edged slots sliced by sheep hooves run along its length and cross the broad footprints left by a couple of geese. A trail of paw prints leads out of the water towards the burn, disappearing along the grassy bank, where a fresh tarry pile of otter spraint has been deposited. At the other end of the beach a flat-topped rock makes the perfect place to sit and enjoy the peace of the loch. Silvery wavelets gently lap the shore and beneath the water the coarse red sand becomes a shining amber patterned with a shifting golden web of sunlight. A swallow, intent on its onward journey, skims low over the water and almost immediately a chorus of shrill cries announces the arrival of the most extreme long-distance traveller of them all \u2013 the Arctic tern. With its long slender wings and a body weight of about 110 grams, it seems impossible that each year these apparently delicate creatures journey from the Antarctic as far north as Svalbard in order to breed. They remain for only as long as it takes to raise their chicks before embarking on the return trip. It is a life of almost continual travelling. Soon walks around the loch will be abandoned for a while as the terns take over the stony beach at its far end, where they will lay their eggs among the pebbles. They protect them diligently, driving off any intruder, sheep or human, with noisy aerial attacks and blows sharp enough to draw blood from an unprotected head."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
