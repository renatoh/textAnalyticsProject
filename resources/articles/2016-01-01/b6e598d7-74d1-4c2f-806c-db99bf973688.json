The reverse ruling in the case could have postponed indefinitely the cases against all five officers in the closely watched case. Judge Barry Williams held that Officer William Porter could not be forced to testify in three officers\u2019 trials, while awaiting his own retrial later this year. The ruling comes after Williams made what many people called the unprecedented decision last week to compel Porter\u2019s testimony in the trial of another officer facing the most severe charges, Officer Caesar Goodson. He also held that Porter could be forced to testify against Sgt Alicia White, Porter\u2019s supervisor. Porter\u2019s attorneys argued that the ruling violated Porter\u2019s fifth amendment right against self-incrimination because he is also facing a retrial in his own case related to Gray\u2019s death. They appealed the issue to Maryland\u2019s second highest court, and the court issued an injunction until after it hears arguments on 4 March. That appeals court ruling postponed for months or longer what many consider the most crucial case over Gray\u2019s death, that against Goodson, the driver of the van in which Gray suffered a fatal spinal injury. Wednesday\u2019s hearing confirmed that the other three trials would continue as scheduled so that jury selection in the case against Officer Edward Nero will begin 22 February, followed by that of Garrett Miller on 7 March. The state argued that it wanted Porter to testify so it could show that Nero, Brian Rice and Miller did not fasten Gray\u2019s seatbelt on the van\u2019s second stop, shortly after Gray\u2019s arrest and to help show when the injury occurred. This would have postponed all of the cases indefinitely. In denying the motion, the judge argued that the state had a \u201cdual purpose, to get the postponement that they want \u2026 and possibly for the reasons that they stated.\u201d Porter\u2019s attorney argued that the prosecution wanted to \u201ctake him hostage for five cases and then torture him at his own trial,\u201d with a \u201cminefield\u201d of possibilities for perjury, of which the state accused Porter in his own trial, frequently saying that he had lied on the stand. The hearing was the first time that Sgt White, Lt Rice, and officers Nero and Miller have been before the judge with their lawyers. \u201cMy reading of this is judge Williams wants the other trials to move forward,\u201d said Douglas Colbert, a law professor at the University of Maryland. \u201cBut it is not often that these issues are decided in a way that hampers the prosecution.\u201d \u201cAs far as this court is concerned, we\u2019re continuing,\u201d Williams said before adjourning the court. Gray\u2019s death set off unrest that resulted in riots, a curfew, and an investigation of the Baltimore police department by the Department of Justice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
