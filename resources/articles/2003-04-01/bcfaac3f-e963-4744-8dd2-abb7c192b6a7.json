Whether we wish to apply for a job that requires language skills or study in the medium of a second language, the right grade is our passport to progress. Language tests can be used to promote access through the valid certification of learning and skills, or they can be misused to exclude groups from participation. The International Language Testing Service (Ielts) claims its test is recognised by \"universities and employers in many countries . . . professional bodies, immigration authorities and other government agencies\". Indeed, Ielts scores are required for immigration to Australia, Canada and New Zealand, although some other test scores are also recognised. Twelve months ago Britain's Home Secretary, David Blunkett, announced his desire to establish a compulsory English language test for immigrants who wished to become British citizens. Since then the government has retreated from this position to the more liberal one of requiring evidence of \"progress\" in language learning. Many European countries also require immigrants to pass language tests to qualify for immigration and/or naturalisation, including the Netherlands, Germany, France and Austria. More recently other European Union countries have begun to use language tests to identify and exclude \"bogus asylum seekers\" from initial entry to the country. Such news stories often attract little attention from the public. But over the last century language tests have been used to achieve politically driven immigration and asylum policies that governments may not otherwise have been able to implement. The most infamous example of the use of a language test to exclude particular ethnic groups is the Australian dictation test. In December 1901 the newly independent Australia passed the Immigration Restriction Act that ushered in the \"White Australia\" policy. The underlying reason for the act was the fear among workers that cheap labour from the Pacific islands and Asia would threaten their jobs. Immigration was to be controlled by the use of a test that required a potential immigrant to \"write out a dictation and sign in the presence of an officer, a passage of 50 words in a European language directed by the officer\". The use of a test was required in order to avoid reference to race, which would have caused offence to Japan, Britain's closest ally in the Pacific at the time. The test instructions were used from the very earliest days to curtail immigration, and dictations in multiple languages were developed so that one could be given in a language unfamiliar to the candidate. By 1909 the pass rate had fallen to zero. The following extract from directions sent to test administrators in 1927 shows how explicit the policy had become. \"The test when applied to an immigrant, is intended to serve as an absolute bar to such a person's entry into Australia... The test should therefore be applied in a language with which the immigrant is not sufficiently acquainted to be able to write out at dictation.\" A similar issue was also behind the 1924 Immigration Act in the US. As Calvin Coolidge said on December 6, 1923, \"America must be kept American\". But here, the fear stemmed from the results of mass intelligence testing during the first world war. Researchers such as Robert Yerkes had predicted that the average level of American intelligence was declining because of the immigration of less intelligent ethnic groups. Carl Brigham echoed the popular consensus in 1923 when he wrote in a popular pamphlet: \"The steps that should be taken to preserve or increase our present intellectual capacity must of course be dictated by science and not by political expediency. Immigration should not only be restrictive but highly selective. And the revision of the immigration and naturalisation laws will only afford a slight relief from our present difficulty. The really important steps are those looking toward the prevention of the continued propagation of defective strains in the present population.\" The restriction of immigration in the 1924 Act was based upon a quota system, but there was a loophole. Anyone entering the US on a student visa was outside the quota. It became essential to close this loophole, and the solution was the 1930 College Board English Language Test, which contained the first large-scale test of speaking a second language to be introduced anywhere in the world. The new movements in Australia (the development of the access test under the Keating government in 1992, and the recent adoption of Ielts) and the use of language tests in Europe are worrying. For language tests that are developed for purposes other than certifying the ability to undertake work and minimal social requirements in the context of immigration, or which have not been re-validated for those purposes, are being used to achieve political ends by stealth. This is both unscientific and potentially unfair to the test takers, as we have no evidence to suggest that the meaning of the score relates to the intended criterion - ability to survive in the host culture. The latest example is the use of Eqvator (the language section of the Swedish Immigration Authority) to assess recordings of immigrants' speech to determine if they originate from the place they claim to come from. If a test taker claims to be an Afghan for asylum purposes and the test analyst claims that he is not, asylum can be rejected. Unfortunately these modern shibboleth tests are being used by Denmark, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Britain and Australia, even though their reliability and validity for this purpose are challenged by all language and language testing experts. The real question is whether language tests should be used for fair access to educational programmes and facilities, posts that require language skills, or to assess individuals and groups for placement and training. Or whether they are to be used as a means of implementing immigration policies surreptitiously. The ethical issues associated with these choices lie not with teachers who may have to prepare students to take tests. Rather, they lie with test developers and testing agencies. The latter need to take a stand by stating explicitly what their tests should not be used for, as part of the definition of test purpose. To this end the International Language Testing Association Code of Ethics (available at www.dundee.ac.uk/languagestudies/ltest/ilta/code.pdf) provides guidelines for the practice of language testing, and would also be useful reading for the politician with an eye on language testing as a solution for a political and social problem. \u00b7 Glenn Fulcher is director of the Centre for Applied Language Studies at the University of Dundee.
