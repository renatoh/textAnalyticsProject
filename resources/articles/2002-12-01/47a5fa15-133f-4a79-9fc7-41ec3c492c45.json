Michael Portillo, one-time contender for the Tory crown, enjoys an entry in the latest register of members' interests that stretches to two full pages, double that of anyone else in the chamber. Since failing to win leadership of the Conservative party last year, Mr Portillo has embarked on a frenzied bout of speaking engagements and media plays around the world. His speeches earned him up to \u00a310,000 a shot, while a run of articles he has written for the Times, the Daily Telegraph, the Sunday Telegraph and London's Evening Standard have commanded fees of up to \u00a35,000 apiece. The man who vowed to pare back his political commitments and \"get a life\" has also won lucrative television contracts, including commissions for a string of BBC documentaries on government secrecy, Wagner and Europe. He got up to \u00a320,000 for presenting an episode of the BBC's Great Britons series. Mr Portillo's extra-curricular activities have been helped by complimentary membership of the Carlton Tower Hotel health spa and Chelsea Arts Club, his entry reveals. Meanwhile, the man to whom he lost control, the Tory leader, Iain Duncan Smith, enjoys a less illustrious entry. Among the perks he has listed since becoming party leader are discounts at the Queen's dressmakers for his wife Betsy. Mrs Duncan Smith received discounts from the Luxury Brands Group, which used to be led by her brother-in-law David. The company lent her outfits to wear at official functions she attended as wife of the leader of the opposition. On the other side of the house, the prime minister lists two overseas trips, one a family holiday to Egypt paid for by the Egyptian government and the second flights taken by his wife, Cherie, to and from Bermuda. Her flights were paid for by the Bermudan government, but she met the costs of her family companions. The former Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, remains a director and shareholder of Clemmow Hornby Inge, an agency that won the contract to run the Labour party's \u00a34m general election advertising campaign. He earns up to \u00a315,000 for a column in GQ magazine and has registered trips to Cape Town, Johannesburg, Israel, Berlin, Russia, New York, Vienna, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore. Gordon Brown, the self-styled \"Iron Chancellor\", meanwhile, has no recorded interests."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
