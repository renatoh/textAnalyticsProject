Now comes the earliest of Albeniz's English operas, Henry Clifford, a story of love and conflicting loyalties set at the time of the Wars of the Roses. As with Merlin, the big snag is the libretto, the work of the composer's benefactor, the banker Francis Burdett Money-Coutts. But on disc one can forgive the slow-moving plot - history and the supernatural mixed oddly together - and the unbelievably clumsy verses, since the music is so fresh. With ecstatic writing for women's voices in particular, each act brings memorable moments. As with Merlin, conductor Jose de Eusebio is a persuasive advocate, leading a fine cast headed by Alessandra Marc and Jane Henschel (both superb), tenor Aquiles Machado in the taxing title role and Carlos Alvarez as Lord St John, all coping with the English text very well. Recommended to anyone who enjoys an operatic costume drama in a warm, late-romantic idiom, opulently orchestrated."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
