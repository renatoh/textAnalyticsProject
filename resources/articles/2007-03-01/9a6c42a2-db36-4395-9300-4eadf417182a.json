Naval officers and diplomats suggested the issue of maritime boundaries was complicated and the whole affair could be a mistake. It was the line taken by foreign secretary Margaret Beckett in her first conversation with her Iranian counterpart, Manouchehr Mottaki, on Sunday. It had the advantage of not pushing Tehran into a corner and allowing a face-saving way out, in the hope that the incident would play out like its precursor in 2004, when British captives were released after three days. This time, the circumstances seem to be different. The Revolutionary Guards are more entrenched in power, and are close to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The reformers in Tehran are cowed. Approaches were made to Russia, Turkey and Arab states in the hope they had more direct lines of communication with Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei but to no avail. To some extent the lack of response was predictable. The Iranian New Year holidays are observed by almost everyone including the political and clerical elite. The holiday ends in early April but Tony Blair decided Britain was not prepared to wait that long. Mr Blair's announcement that the British response was entering a \"different phase\" and Mrs Beckett's announcement of the diplomatic sanctions yesterday reflects a decision that the softly-softly approach has not worked, and rising concern that time is not on Britain's side. The new phase This began yesterday with a concerted offensive by the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office. It opened with a far more assertive and detailed presentation of Britain's legal position, complete with charts and map coordinates, and the sequence of events. It was accompanied by the first concrete sanction - the severing of government contacts. That includes a refusal to issue any visas to Iranian officials and a suspension of any meetings between diplomats from either government. It falls short of a full break in diplomatic relations, but that would clearly be counter-productive as Britain needs to keep talking to Tehran. Mrs Beckett also introduced another, perhaps riskier, element into the strategy in her announcement - her note of ridicule will not have been missed in Tehran. By recounting an apparent comedy of errors in the Iranian foreign ministry's handling of the affair - with the Iranian ambassador to London initially presenting map coordinates for the incident that bolstered Britain's argument that it happened in Iraqi waters - she made Iran's diplomats look inept. Further sanctions The new phase runs the risk of entrenching Iranian positions, and blocking off the easy face-saving exit. Yet if this initial diplomatic rebuke fails, the government is committed to ratchet up its response still further or lose credibility with Tehran, and other adversaries. The next step could be to start slowing down or stopping visas issued to ordinary Iranians, including students and businessmen, which would upset Tehran's middle classes. After that, the usual logic of international sanctions suggest targeted financial measures, freezing accounts of Iranian leaders and any organisations they may be linked to. Then comes trade sanctions: prohibition on British companies from doing business with Iran, and a ban on Iranian imports. But such measures are likely to damage Britain at least as much as Iran if carried out unilaterally. Students and businessmen could just take their money elsewhere in Europe or to the United States. Multilateral measures The timing for Britain is terrible. It has just led a push for UN sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme, persuading Russia and its allies to sign on reluctantly to freezing the assets of prominent Iranians including Revolutionary Guard leaders. It has therefore already used much of its credit at the UN. Meanwhile, the White House has let it be known that while it supports Britain's position, \"there is no escalation of tensions on our part\". That may be welcomed in London. US support is a mixed blessing in a country where America is known as the \"Great Satan\" and Britain its \"Little Satan\" sidekick. The most promising route then, could be common European action. Germany, in its role as EU president has been supportive, calling the Iranian action \"unacceptable\". Military rescue The precedents for daring raids to rescue hostages from Iran are not encouraging. President Jimmy Carter tried it in 1980, but the special forces raid, Operation Eagle Claw, ended in disaster when a helicopter collided with a US plane in a sandstorm in the Iranian desert. Eight Americans were killed. Britain is in an even weaker position militarily, as the Iranians could easily take reprisals against British troops in Basra."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
