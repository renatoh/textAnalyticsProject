You can whistle at me on the street where I am walking.\u201d The rub: \u201cI\u2019ve only got one rule \u2013 don\u2019t tell me to smile. I\u2019ll take you down.\u201d Mary\u2019s remarkable voice can flip from coquettish to roaring siren on the turn of a phrase and it makes a generous vehicle for her panoply of often-conflicted female identities. On Synthia she cycles through rage, confusion, lust, embarrassment, anger, familial concern and wry humour, often all in the space of a song (the build-to-explosion of opener Stand and Deliver). It feeds a prickly duality that haunts Synthia: pleasure-seeking thrills pitted against the potential punishment of intimacy. The band\u2019s story in the lead-up to Synthia is littered with foreshadowing. After a gruelling world tour behind their difficult second album, the critically lukewarm The Brink, the band took an extended break. Mary was instigator, travelling the US and the UK, where \u2013 as she told Rolling Stone \u2013 she \u201clived a life of hedonism for three to six months\u201d, hanging out with \u201cproper rock\u2019n\u2019rollers who still think it\u2019s the 70s and take a lot of drugs and have a lot of sex. It was great!\u201d Drummer Nik Kaloper shifted to the UK, guitarist Samuel Lockwood stayed home. Privately the band were grappling with keyboardist Heather Shannon\u2019s diagnosis of ovarian cancer, discovered before sessions for The Brink but made public only last month as the reason for cancelling the slated tour behind Synthia. The latter is especially cruel, as Synthia is easily the band\u2019s best record, thanks largely to Shannon\u2019s dynamic lead. The album soars on her synths; the rubbery oscillating arpeggios that collapse into glassy shards on Come Alive, the squeaking churn that lifts Pleasure Drive, or any other of the album\u2019s hook-drenched, key-led arrangements. Lockwood too has gone up a gear, preferring odd atmospheric flourishes and shoegazey washes to power chord slug-outs (though still able to marry both, as on proggy stomper My Love Is My Disease). Kaloper finds spare nooks to rattle off tricky fills and unusual time signatures. The talented musical trio have always found pockets to shine individually but Synthia \u2013 a name that covers Greek mythology, a famous groupie (Cynthia Plaster Caster), as well as the nickname scientists gave to the first artificial cell \u2013 repackages them as an enticing new whole. Mary bends this unique sonic universe to her thematic will. The glacial space opera of A Message From My Mothers Passed and the glammy strut of Pleasure Drive touch on the conflict of the female urge towards both being the matriarch and sexual liberation. If Ya Want Me mirrors the Biblical story of the band\u2019s name \u2013 Jezebel, as written by man, was a \u201cshameless\u201d, powerful woman unfearing of man or God, who was feared by men (and their idealised male god) and killed \u2013 with Mary confidently offering herself up to a reluctant paramour. \u201cComin\u2019 up your road, your no through road,\u201d Mary sings. \u201cBit much of that around, to stick your flag in now? Can always find another girl.\u201d It\u2019s an internal duel as much as physical and across the album these parries with self highlight a fascinating tension between feminist ideologies, the male-dominated routines of rock legacy and Mary\u2019s assumed role as a prominent female public figure. It comes to a head on album closer, Stamina, a glacial eruption that says the buck stops with not love, sanctuary, or \u201ca man\u201d but resilience. \u201cRev it up,\u201d Mary demands. \u201cLose control.\u201d It\u2019s heady stuff, particularly for a band of indie rock pedigree, but with Synthia the Jezabels have unearthed a perfectly weighted arsenal to deliver it. Since their emergence in the late 00s with a trio of bombastic EPs, they have often been pegged as pompous dreamers to a local music culture that celebrates the knockabout underdog over the ambitious. But recorded with longtime collaborator Lachlan Mitchell in an inspired rush, after the band reconvened out of obligation and found themselves creatively renewed, Synthia seems the document the Jezabels were always building to. There\u2019s a new internal symmetry and inventiveness to their universe, the band more playful and wise, focused from having lived more life. Godspeed to Shannon\u2019s recovery and may they get the victory lap they deserve."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
