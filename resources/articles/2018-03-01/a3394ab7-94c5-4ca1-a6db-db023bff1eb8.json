Soe Gschwind-Penski, the Overwatch League host and analyst known as Soembie, had sent a tweet earlier on Thursday offering \u201ca special shoutout to all the men in our lives who have supported us, gave us a voice when we had none, fought for our cause and treated us the way we all ought to treat each other...like a fellow human being - no race, no gender\u201d. But shortly after, the 29-year-old from Switzerland described the heaps of abuse prompted by her initial remark by way of responding to a user who wrote: \u201cLady you have some internal misogyny to deal with\u201d. \u201cIve gotten death threats and hundreds of hate messages the past 20 minutes because I thanked men for treating me as their equal, on a day which is all about womens struggle for equality,\u201d Gschwind-Penski posted. \u201cHate, because I am grateful for the men in our lives who fight alongside us for our rights.\u201d She added: \u201c[D]id I offend you by treating ALL genders equal and thank humans for treating each other the way they should? Believe it or not but women are not the only ones fighting for equality.\u201d The professional scene around Overwatch, a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter from World of Warcraft developer Blizzard featuring a diverse cast of heroes spanning genders and ethnicities, has at times struggled to reflect the game\u2019s inclusive values. The two-year-old OWL did make headlines last month when South Korean teenager Kim Se-yeon signed with the Shanghai Dragons to become the league\u2019s first female player. But high-profile eSports competitions remain a male-dominated space: Gschwind-Penski is the only female member of OWL\u2019s full-time commentary team."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
