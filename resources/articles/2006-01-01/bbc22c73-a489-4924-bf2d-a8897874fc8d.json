There is no necessity, was his gist. Clubs used to get bumper gates at this time of year, whereas now attendances stay fairly level throughout the season, so why on earth do we still cram four games into 10 wintry days? Because we like it that way, is the short and honest answer. Managers might struggle with injuries and exhausted players, but it is the same for everyone. Take a couple of matches out of the festive programme, in order to carry on playing one game per week, and you would have to extend the season by at least a fortnight. No one wants that, and not just because there's a World Cup in the summer. Bolton missed one game through a frozen pitch to start Sam Allardyce moaning about a fixture pile-up. Much better to pack a few extra games in when people actually want to see them. The English season does not just have a beginning and an end, it has a very definite middle, which brings the rest of the campaign into sharp focus. Clubs go into the Christmas period with half-formed expectations of what the future might bring. They come out of it knowing exactly where they stand and what needs to be done. The halfway point of the season is eagerly awaited in the months preceding the turn of year, yet as soon as the exact moment arrives (just about now) it is lost in a blur of controversy, changing places and upcoming matches. When normality returns, the end of the season is clearly in sight. The talk is about how many games are left to avoid relegation/make Europe/ overhaul Manchester United. No one has yet started talking about overhauling Chelsea. Some clubs' fortunes are transformed during the holiday period, too. \"The holiday period could define our season,\" David O'Leary said, with unusual sagacity, a couple of weeks ago. Sure enough, the Aston Villa who greeted Manchester United with all the spiky defiance of a welcome mat in mid-December scored four goals against Everton on Boxing Day and were unlucky not to take more than a point from the six-goal thriller at Craven Cottage two days later. In doing so they made a determined spring for mid-table. Going the opposite way are Everton, whose disappointing season became an official dalliance with the drop zone over Christmas. Just as you can pick up important points in a short time, you can also watch them disappear. And if your games-played figure rises by three or four while your points tally remains static and your goals-against column goes haywire, you can only be glad Christmas comes but once a year. We are still in the middle of the holiday period, but just look what the past week or so has confirmed. Chelsea: champions. Liverpool: runners-up. Wigan: safe. Arsenal: relieved. Manchester City: can't defend. Aston Villa: know where the goal is. West Brom: could be the pick of the Midlands bunch. Everton: rumbled. Portsmouth: shopping time is here. Birmingham: could be Everton's worst nightmare. You see memorable games at this time of year, too. Memorable for all the wrong reasons, perhaps, but still memorable. Wigan's exciting 4-3 victory over Manchester City on Boxing Day could have finished 8-8, so atrocious was the defending. All three Midlands club have given their fans more to sing about in the past few days than in the previous three months. High-scoring, error-laden games in sub-zero temperatures, preferably with prominent players from the Italian or Spanish leagues looking on in bemusement from the stands, are exactly what festive football should be all about. What it should not be all about is late postponements. To an extent, with the present safety considerations in force, inclement weather will always find a way to inconvenience supporters. But why on earth were Charlton scheduled to play a night match at Newcastle on 28 December? It might not be possible to fill the festive programme with derbies - that could add too much spice to an already rich mix - but 600-mile round trips on Wednesday nights are best avoided at any time of year. Last night's New Year's Eve fixture that took Newcastle to Spurs was just as insultingly thoughtless, as is Blackburn v Portsmouth tomorrow night. Richard Scudamore, the Premier League's chief executive, has just said: 'The fans are the most important thing and we have to make sure that our fixtures reflect that.' Now that would be a Christmas present. ************** Michael Owen as a hard-luck story? Surely some mistake. Fancy those lovable Scousers at Anfield not making a permanent place in their hearts for someone who jilted them to join a real Champions League club. Doubtless Owen was surprised by the hostility of his reception when he returned to Liverpool last week and no sensible judge would argue that someone so synonymous with success at the club deserved the stick that came his way. But since when have football crowds been sensible judges? Did Wayne Rooney deserve all the abuse he received on his first return to Goodison? Are Leeds fans justified in regarding the previously loyal and committed Alan Smith as a hate figure just because he ended up being flogged to Manchester United? At least Owen did not join Manchester United, otherwise he would have been prepared for the worst on his first return to Merseyside. Yet, in a way - a subtly modern way - Owen's crime in the eyes of supporters was almost as bad. Rooney and Smith were sold through financial necessity, when Everton and Leeds needed the money more than the asset, and neither player could be expected to say no once Manchester United put their cash on the table. Liverpool did not have to sell Owen - indeed, they said they wanted to keep him. It was the player's decision to leave. The situation may not have been quite as black-and-white as it appeared, with Owen's contract running down, Rafael Benitez just arrived as manager at Anfield and Real Madrid's interest no more than lukewarm. But Liverpool fans were definitely left with the impression that their ambitious striker was leaving to join a more ambitious club. Steve McManaman had done the same and it worked. Say what you like about McManaman, and plenty of people do, but he has a European Cup winner's medal he would not have picked up with Liverpool in 2000. If Owen was expecting something similar he was cruelly disappointed. Despite some excellent performances, he found he was not really wanted at the Bernabeu, confirming the view that Real Madrid might have had one eye on his resale value all along. Real did not win the European Cup either, their policy of signing galacticos having begun to backfire before Owen even arrived. Most important of all, Liverpool did. What the epic events in Istanbul last May actually meant was that the thousands of Liverpool supporters for whom changing clubs was not an option, the ones who had looked on impotently as Owen packed his bags for fresh challenges in Spain, saw their loyalty rewarded with a long and unexpected last laugh. A debating society might have honoured Owen's contribution to the Liverpool cause over the years, an opera house might have sent for a bouquet of flowers, but Anfield, thankfully, is still home to a football crowd. So a certain amount of gloating was inevitable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
