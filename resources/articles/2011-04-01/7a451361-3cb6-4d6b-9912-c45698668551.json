Blackpool's manager feels one more win could be enough to get his team out of trouble and he may have stumbled upon the secret to a successful survival bid \u2013 start the day in the relegation zone. That could be the only answer to the Blackpool side of old being back on show at here. The mindset was different, the football was certainly different. This was the version of Blackpool which seemed to have disappeared, playing at a high tempo which was too much for Newcastle at times. The only thing missing was a winning goal that the hosts deserved from a dominant display that saw them climb out of the bottom three on goal difference. If there's one thing you cannot question it is Blackpool's stomach for a fight and they will not go down waving the white flag and surrendering. \"To win 10 games was the biggest thing I wanted \u2013 to answer the people who said we wouldn't even get 10 points, never mind that many victories,\" said Holloway. \"If we get there that might even be enough. We've got nine wins already and one more might catapult us out of trouble. \"I honestly think we can take anyone on. There has hardly been a game where we were completely useless \u2013 maybe Wigan last week, but that's it. I'm very proud of what we're trying to achieve. As long as they continue to do that nobody will be able to say they haven't contributed to a wonderful season, whatever happens. I still believe there's enough in us to cause the biggest shock ever by staying up.\" If Blackpool are to avoid relegation then Charlie Adam will need to play a vital role. He is a vital cog in the Blackpool machine that could yet pull off the unthinkable. If they are to do so, the team also needs good fortune on their side, something they were so short of here. With man of the match David Vaughan prompting and probing on his return from injury, the pressure appeared to have been lifted from Adam's shoulders. Yet perhaps he was a little too relaxed as his pass was gifted to Joey Barton, who fed Peter Lovenkrands to fire home from 20-yards out. That 17th\u2011minute opener was as good as it got for Newcastle as thereafter Blackpool piled on the pressure and saw two penalty appeals waved away by the referee, Martin Atkinson, before DJ Campbell levelled. There was a hint of controversy surrounding the strike, though, with the assistant referee, Peter Kirkup, deeming the ball had crossed the line despite Jos\u00e9 Enrique's efforts to clear the ball before it crossed the line in the 32nd minute. If that was the bit of luck Blackpool thought would turn around their season then they were mistaken, with Adam coming the closest to finding a winner as he rattled the post. Blackpool's midfielder Keith Southern believes his team-mates now being above Wigan and out of the relegation zone on goal difference is an irrelevance, as they still have four matches to play. \"It's nice, but it doesn't mean anything,\" he said. \"It would be nice if you could fast-forward and we're above it [at the end of the season], but it's just vital that we are out of it when the final ball is kicked this season.\" While Blackpool fret, Newcastle can relax having all but secured their top-flight status for another season. At the seaside on Saturday it was fair to say that some of the visiting players, following their exploits in the 0-0 draw with Manchester United a few days earlier, already appeared to be looking ahead to a summer on the beach. \"If you look at it, something has to go unbelievably wrong now,\" said Lovenkrands. \"To throw it away, with the goal difference we've got and the points tally we've collected with just four games left, it would have to go really wrong. We just need to finish the season well and get over that final hurdle.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
