With the 2011 winner, Tony Martin, missing the decisive 21-rider move, the big threat to the Briton looks set to come from the American Levi Leipheimer and his French team-mate Sylvain Chavanel. The American and the Frenchman had the bonus of seeing their Belgian team-mate Tom Boonen - the 2005 world road race champion - take the finish sprint for his fifth victory of the season. Their Omega-Pharma-Quickstep squad was numerically the strongest in the lead group which escaped when sidewinds buffeted the peloton after the feed station, some 50 miles from the finish. It was a classic stage racing moment: the route changed direction, the wind switched from being in the peloton's faces to being on their shoulders and the field split into four, with the overnight leader, Thomas Larsson of Switzerland \u2013 who had beaten Wiggins into second place by a single second in Sunday's opening time trial \u2013 in the second group, 2min 29sec behind at the finish. The Londoner thus became the first Briton to lead Paris-Nice since David Millar in 2007 and only the fifth in the race's near 80-year history. The others are all British greats: Robert Millar, Chris Boardman and Tom Simpson, who remains the only British cyclist to take the overall title, in the year of his death, 1967. The four Omega-Pharma riders in the front group \u2013 Leipheimer, Chavanel, Boonen and the Belgian Nikolas Maes \u2013 may briefly have thought about waiting for Martin, their team-mate, but Leipheimer and Chavanel had finished third and sixth behind Larsson on Sunday and were clearly better bets for a high overall placing, so the German was left behind. At the front Wiggins had only one team-mate to assist him, the Welshman Geraint Thomas, for whom the \"race to the sun\" is a brief interlude in track training for the team pursuit in the London Olympics. It was, however, the triple Olympic gold medallist who looked the strongest in the group as they sped ahead on the flat avenues into Orleans, occasionally moving a few metres clear of the rest as he made the pace, and having to slow down and wait for his companions. He sprinted ahead to win three bonus seconds at an intermediate sprint 50km from the finish and now leads Leipheimer by six seconds. Chavanel is handily placed going into the hillier stages, which culminate in Thursday's steep uphill finish at Mende in the Massif Central, while the other key challenger to make the front group is Alejandro Valverde of Spain, back from a doping ban but seemingly as strong as before."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
