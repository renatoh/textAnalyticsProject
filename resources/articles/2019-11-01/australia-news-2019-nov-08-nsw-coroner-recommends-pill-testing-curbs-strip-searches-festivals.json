In landmark findings published on Friday, Harriet Grahame recommended pill-testing be introduced and said she was satisfied there was \u201csignificant evidence\u201d that \u201cintensive and punitive drug policing operations\u201d were increasing \u201cdrug-related risks and harm\u201d. Drug dogs had \u201cthe capacity to cause harm without strong evidence it is effective in reducing overall drug supply\u201d. \u201cI am of the firm view there is sound evidence that high-visibility policing and the use of drug dogs is a harmful intervention,\u201d she said. The \u201cwholesale practice of strip-searching young people\u201d was of \u201cgrave concern\u201d, and its use to target people suspected of drug possession was \u201cout of line with the purposes\u201d of the legislation. Grahame recommended a pill-testing trial be introduced both at music festivals and in the community in time for this summer\u2019s festivals. \u201cAt the end of my reflection I am in no doubt whatsoever there is sufficient evidence to support a drug-checking trial in this state,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course drug-checking is not a magic solution to these tragic deaths; of course its introduction will not guarantee further deaths will not occur. Drug-checking is simply an evidence-based harm-reduction strategy that should be trialled as soon as possible in NSW.\u201d In July Grahame examined the deaths of six young people who died as a result of MDMA toxicity or complications of MDMA use at music festivals between December 2017 and January 2019. Before the five MDMA-related deaths at music festivals in NSW last summer, there had been only 12 across Australia in the previous decade. On Friday Grahame thanked the parents of the six young people, and said each of the deaths was a \u201ctragedy\u201d. Nathan Tran, 18, Diana Nguyen, 21, Joseph Pham, 23, Callum Brosnan, 19, Alexandra Ross-King, 19, and Joshua Tam, 22, all died from MDMA toxicity or complications of MDMA use at music festivals between December 2017 and January 2019. As well as those fatalities, there were 29 pre-hospital intubations at 25 music festivals in the state in 2018-2019, 25 drug-related intensive care admissions, and at least an additional 23 drug-related hospital admissions. The bulk of Grahame\u2019s recommendations were leaked in a draft of her final report obtained by the Daily Telegraph after it was circulated to government departments including the health department and NSW police. Immediately after Grahame handed down her findings the NSW commissioner of police, Mick Fuller, released a statement saying he \u201cstrongly defended\u201d the suggestion police were \u201cimplicit\u201d in the deaths. He also said music festivals \u201ccreate a concentrated market for drug supply and organised criminal groups\u201d. \u201cOur officers see the adverse effects of all forms of drugs on a daily basis, and our submissions to the inquest relied on a collective experience in relation to drug use and supply,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a policing perspective, we remain committed to reducing the supply of illicit drugs throughout NSW, including at music festivals.\u201d At the time, the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, dismissed the recommendation to introduce pill-testing on the basis it would give a \u201cfalse sense of security\u201d to festival-goers. Outside the coroner\u2019s court on Friday, Jennie Ross-King, the mother of Alex Ross-King, urged Berejiklian to \u201clisten to the experts\u201d and introduce pill-testing before the summer. \u201cPill-testing is available now. These guys are sitting there waiting for a phone call to turn up,\u201d she said. Ross-King said the coroner\u2019s recommendations would \u201csave someone\u2019s life\u201d if the government listened. \u201cWe can finally say now, well, you know, she\u2019s got the evidence she hasn\u2019t had previously and I think it\u2019s important [that] she can make an informed decision,\u201d she said. Telling young people \u201cjust say no\u201d to drugs did not work. \u201cWe have to educate ourselves as parents,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t know anything, I now know that. Just say no, they\u2019re bad, they can harm you. I said all those things, I said everything I was educated as a parent to say to my daughter and it didn\u2019t work.\u201d Another mother, Julie Tam, urged Berejiklian not to \u201cwaste this opportunity\u201d. \u201cNone of us standing here in front of you today want to be here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would give anything to have our children back [but] as parents we stand before you and urge you to embrace the recommendations and implement them.\u201d Grahame also called for police to limit the use of strip searches to people suspected of supply, and for the government to pay to establish a permanent drug-checking facility outside the festival context. \u201cGiven the evidence of a link between drug dogs and more harmful means of consumption\u201d, Grahame said, the \u201cmodel of policing\u201d at music festivals should be changed. \u201cGiven the harm caused by police strip-searching for possession of drugs\u201d including \u201cmore harmful means of consumption\u201d, the NSW police commissioner should amend practices to limit their use to cases where a person is suspected of a supply offence or \u201cthere are reasonable grounds the strip search is necessary to prevent an immediate risk to a persons safety or immediate loss of evidence\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
