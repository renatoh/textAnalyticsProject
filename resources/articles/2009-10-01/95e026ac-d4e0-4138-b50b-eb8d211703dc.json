But, according to new figures, the downturn has not dented philanthropic activity among City firms. Entries for the City of London Corporation's (CLC) prestigious Dragon awards, due to be announced tomorrow night, reveal a big increase in newcomers to corporate social responsibility (CSR). The awards honour companies that promote social inclusion and local economic regeneration. This year, 34% of all applications are for the Heart of the City award, the category for community involvement programmes established in the last three years. This is an increase of 69% on 2008. The trend is mirrored by the CLC's City Action initiative, which brokers volunteering between more than 1,200 employees in 60 firms and community groups or charities. City Action saw a 90% increase in new matches between companies and community organisations in the first quarter of this financial year. Catharine Riseborough, CLC Dragon Awards co-ordinator, says the increase is due to the recognition that volunteering not only improves staff morale, but also makes business sense. \"A company's reputation can be enhanced through its active community involvement,\" Riseborough says. \"Some tender proposals now ask a company to outline its CSR policy.\" As well as helping with staff recruitment and retention, volunteering fosters staff loyalty and encourages new skills such as teamworking and problem solving, Riseborough says. Japanese bank Nomura, for example, is preparing to mark the first anniversary of its partnership with Oaklands, a local secondary school in London's East End, which had been supported by Lehman Brothers staff. When Nomura took over the bankrupt bank, there were fears that the employee volunteering scheme would fold. But its new owners adopted its school volunteering programme. Now, 62 employees of Nomura volunteer regularly, mentoring pupils and helping with reading and numeracy. The bank also donated \u00a3100,000 to Oaklands last year. Malcolm Horton, global head of recruitment and programmes at Nomura, says: \"The community affairs programme has significantly contributed to the development of our culture; our activities have brought our employees together and raised morale at a crucial moment in our history.\" Businesses that support CSR believe their philanthropic activities are an investment. For example, 8Build, a four-year-old construction company shortlisted for a Dragon award, has given 1,500 volunteering hours to the community in east London, and provides work placements for students. Kelly Hudson, 8Build marketing director, explains: \"Besides the moral stance, a business's contribution to being socially responsible is something that can help you attract the best staff and win business.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
