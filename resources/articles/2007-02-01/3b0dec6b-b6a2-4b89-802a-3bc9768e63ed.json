From Ian Merchant Rob Evans and I are the two reporters who first broke the BAE corruption story in the Guardian in 2003. Every time we have subsequently written a corruption article about BAE (which we've done by the dozen) we have opened the papers and smiled ironically the following morning. The share price invariably goes up. It happened again this week as Europe's biggest arms company declared record profits and prospects. It's as if the City, confronted with allegations of such ruthless and corrupt behaviour, thinks \"Hey! These guys certainly know how to make money. Let's invest!\" BAE used its political muscle to shut down the Serious Fraud Office investigation into deals with its biggest export customer, Saudi Arabia. Mike Turner, BAE's chief executive, was named by the SFO as a corruption suspect himself in an SFO dossier sent to South Africa, one of the many other countries where BAE dealings are under investigation. But Turner's not the one who turns out to have the problems. Instead the SFO's courageous head, Robert Wardle, finds his agency on the chopping block. Never has a major British company been confronted with such a parade of global corruption allegations as BAE. But its response has been extraordinary. Turner sniffed yesterday that the torrent of reporting about BAE deals has been \"unfair and unjust\". But the company has not been prepared to explain even one of the highly detailed disclosures around the world. Why did BAE set up a secret subsidiary called Red Diamond that never appeared in its published accounts and was registered in the murky anonymity of the British Virgin Islands? Why did Red Diamond pay hundreds of millions of pounds into other people's Swiss bank accounts? What sort of way is this to run a public company? Not a normal one, surely. Yet BAE makes no denials and answers no questions. As the business editor of the Times pointed out, BAE must confront its history and hold a proper inquiry if it is to lift the shadows on its reputation. David Leigh Is Juan Diego Florez the new top tenor? From Martin Shuttleworth According to La Scala he must be: breaking a 70-year embargo on encores, Florez was forced to encore his showstopping aria Ah! mes amis in a recent performance of Donizetti's La fille du r\u00e9giment in Milan. Not everyone in the audience was happy, even if they got to hear his nine radiant top Cs again: critics called it sacrilege that the flow of Donizetti's opera should be interrupted to satisfy an audience baying for vocal virtuosity. There's no doubt Florez is the great lyrical maestro of the tenor voice at the moment, especially with the spectacular fall from grace of Roberto Alagna on the same La Scala stage in December after being booed during a performance of Verdi's Aida. Florez also sang Tonio in La fille du r\u00e9giment at Covent Garden in their new production earlier this year. Critics went wild for his sheer brilliance in coping with Donizetti's dazzling coloratura. But for my money he was a disappointment. Maybe he was having an off night when I saw the performance, but he looked like he was taking himself far too seriously as the world's greatest tenor, standing and delivering his arias with a woodenness straight out of old school operatic productions. He looked out of his depth dramatically, and was acted off the stage by Natalie Dessay, who gave one of the great vocal and theatrical performances opposite him as Marie. Personally I don't think it's enough just to have the vocal chops any more. That's why, in the pantheon of potential Pavarottis, I'll go for Rolando Villaz\u00f3n rather than Florez. Not only does he sound the part, he has a real dramatic presence: he's studied acting and stagecraft, and he's good at them too. Tom Service What is the matter with curtains? From Lisa Singh It seems the streets of suburbia no longer rustle with the twitch of net curtains or the satisfying swish of smartly drawn drapes. Curtain sales are stalling, it emerged this week, growing just 2% last year, with net curtain sales down 4%. \"I've definitely noticed a shift away from curtains,\" says interior designer Juliet Hunter-Tilney. \"Windows are much better insulated now, and the original reason for those big curtains was to keep out the cold. Also, blinds are cheaper. You need much less fabric.\" Health concerns about dusty soft furnishings could be playing a part. Lindsey McManus of AllergyUK says: \"If you suffer from allergic rhinitis, an allergy to pollen and house dust mites, we always recommend hard flooring and blinds, as these are easier to damp-clean and harbour fewer allergens than carpets and curtains.\" Function is only part of the story - fickle fashion plays a part. The trend for clean-lined minimalism, and the chuck-out-your-chintz values of programmes like Changing Rooms, have made curtains seem rather naff. The extravagant window dressings that strove to recreate country pile style in suburban semis were 80s status symbols - and are now as out as power dressing. \"After the war, fabric was rationed,\" Hunter-Tilney points out, \"but by the 70s and 80s the heyday of big curtains had arrived. People had huge shoulder pads and they also wanted huge curtains.\" The net curtain has become a byword for both nosiness and a rather prissy notion of privacy. In the 21st century we prefer to align ourselves with the simpler, functional styles of our European neighbours where blinds and shutters are ubiquitous. Sales of blinds grew 62% between 2001 and 2006, with the market now worth \u00a3445m. But perhaps curtain lovers need only bide their time. Fashion is cyclical, and often slightly perverse. Buy blinds if you must, but mothball your curtains rather than casting them out. An ironic revival of suburban flounce can only be a few years away. Ros Anderson"}, "isHosted": false}}}
