A heart-warming spectacle demonstrated why Arsenal and, more improbably, Peter Reid's resolute team are pursuing Manchester United. And why neither will catch the leaders. Arsenal, by turns wonderfully fluent and bewilderingly incoherent, chose the last contest of the year to place the largest question mark against their destiny next May. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, in a revealing examination of losing \"two stupid points\", led the interrogation. He answered his own questions, but none too surely. Kevin Phillips's penalty early in the second half was a \"psychological blow\" but \"fatigue came into it\" as Arsenal's imperious early football vanished. But then a second Wenger thought: \"Is it fatigue, is it psychological, or is it a bit of both?\" Eventually Arsenal's manager opted for human frailty. \"The football we played today and against Leicester show we have tremendous potential. But if we have emotional or psychological setbacks, then perhaps we're not strong enough.\" Perhaps Wenger was recalling the frozen fields of Moscow and the brittleness exposed by Bayern Munich as much as the collapse at Liverpool. Either way, Sir Alex Ferguson will feel he is winning the mind games waged between England's rival managers as well as the footballing points. The gap may still be eight points but United seem further away than ever. Sunderland - the Premiership's form team - take great credit for tweaking the title race and freshening up the contest for European places. This comeback said much for their spirit and for their developing football, which is much less one dimensional than their critics would have us believe. They had much more than route one to the head of Niall Quinn and his replacement Danny Dichio. They also had a Peter Reid half-time talk that no doubt blistered ears. Sunderland's manager at first said it was a discussion - \"constructive more than anything; we decided to express ourselves\" - before yielding under further questioning. \"Let's say they did the talking in the second half.\" Alex Rae gave it away, revealing that Reid ordered them \"to get in and about them. The key was that we got tight on [Patrick] Vieira and [Gilles] Grimandi. Vieira got a bit ratty when we started to tackle him. He started looking to the referee for a bit more protection. But I don't think there were many fouls; it was fair stuff.\" Vieira was the victim of one bad foul, a late challenge by Gavin McCann that brought the Sunderland midfielder a booking. It was the closest he got to Vieira in a first half in which the Frenchman made midfield his personal domain. As a cameo of the role reversal of the second half, McCann and then Rae dispossessed Vieira in turn to set up McCann's equaliser. Wenger conceded: \"If you stop Patrick playing, then Arsenal have a problem.\" There was no suggestion by Wenger that Sunderland sought to wind up Vieira, an accusation he levelled after the midfielder's red card in the opening-day defeat, after which the manager was disciplined, pending appeal. This reunion developed the intensity but little of the nastiness of the first meeting, after Vieira, once again, played a pivotal role. This time an arm wrapped around Quinn was adjudged to have contacted the ball. Phillips, who on two other occasions failed to beat Alex Manninger in one-to-one confrontations, did not fail from the penalty spot. Sunderland warmed to their task; Arsenal froze. Nwankwo Kanu, again peripheral, was removed, as was Thierry Henry, handicapped by an ankle injury. The Gunners had shot their bolt. Perseverance paid for Sunderland. \"One thing you can say about us,\" Rae declared, \"is that we are very dogged.\" So it was that Vieira was hunted down, twice, on Arsenal's right flank for McCann to unleash his curling shot from the corner of the area towards the far corner of the net behind which the visiting fans were massed. The roar was of Roker proportions. Henry had gone quietly, probably into the personal break that Wenger hoped to delay until early next month. The manager concedes that his team are over-burdening their top scorer in terms of games and goals: now Henry will probably be rested until Chelsea visit on January 13. For this explosive yet introspective striker, as for Arsenal, it is time for reflection and new resolutions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
