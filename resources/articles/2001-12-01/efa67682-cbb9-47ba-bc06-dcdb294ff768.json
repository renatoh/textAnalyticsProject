Tony McCoy barely moved a muscle aboard Martin Pipe's quick-jumping grey as the combination cruised past the long-time leader, The French Furze, at the second last and scored impressively by nine lengths. The bookmakers William Hill reacted by making Valiramix the 11-2 second favourite for the hurdlers' crown at Cheltenham in March, while Ladbrokes are as short as 5-1 from 8's. Pipe said: \"The Champion Hurdle is his main target. I thought Valiramix was very impressive, as he could not have done it any better. He was always cruising and has still won by nine lengths. I think he will improve for that as he had not run for a while. \"I don't know yet if he will have a run between now and then. We will wait until next term to send him chasing.\" Pipe had a major setback earlier when Magnus, who cost owner David Johnson \u00a3340,000, had a very expensive nosebleed, trailing in last at 1-3 on his British debut in the Relkeel Hurdle. The odds-on favourite looked to be on excellent terms with himself throughout most of the race. He began to make up ground at the end of the back straight, flew the fourth- last and it appeared to be a case of how far the former French-trained five-year-old would win by. Yet, levelling up for home, McCoy sensed something was up and let Magnus come home in his own time, eventually 26 lengths and a distance behind the winner, See You Sometime. It transpired that the horse had broken a blood vessel for the first time in his career. Pipe was pensive after the setback and said: \"He has bled and that's it. Now we have got to get things right. Time will tell, but I have only just got him and it is back to the drawing board. \"It was a small step for Magnus but it will be a giant one for MCP to sort him out. I was pleased with his jumping, however, because at home he has been a bit careless.\" Owner Johnson, who bought Magnus last month after he had won at Auteuil, said: \"Suddenly, he is looking an expensive horse. I thought he would romp in when he was on the far side but when Tony asked he failed to respond. I have been in racing too long to be absolutely shattered, but I am sure you will see him at the National Hunt Festival.\" McCoy went on to notch a double for Pipe when Belle d'Anjou beat Rob Leach three lengths in the Sunley Founda tion Intermediate Hurdle. But the champion jockey missed a treble when Claymore, seemingly home and hosed in the last race, fell at the penultimate flight leaving Robert Alner's Eurotrek and Dean Gallagher to see off First Flight. The card opened with a thriller when Nicky Henderson's hurdling debutant Green Ideal got the better of the Queen Mother's Kelami by a length and a half. The winner, who raced for Amanda Perrett on the Flat, would not be denied by the Fran\u00e7ois Doumen-trained runner-up, and looks a cut above average. Fitzgerald, who partnered Green Ideal, said: \"I rode him work on Saturday and couldn't believe it. He is something special.\" Henderson added: \"He is still a colt, but won't be in two years' time when he goes chasing. It will be softly, softly now with him as he is a prospect of the highest sort.\" Victor Chandler go 25-1 about the first two for the Triumph Hurdle. Two former jockeys who have made the transition to training were on the mark at the meeting. Cruise The Fairway, handled by Brendan Powell and partnered by Adrian Maguire took the three-mile chase from Doumen's Hilltopper, while Mark Pitman's Sterling Stewart, ridden by Timmy Murphy, landed the handicap hurdle at the expense of Lastman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
