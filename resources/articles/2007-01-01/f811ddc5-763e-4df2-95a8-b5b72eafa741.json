Her previous credits include playing the long-suffering Helen Brittas in the 1990s sitcom The Brittas Empire. You once described Joanna as \"a ghastly, terribly old, slutty, egotistical, angry whore\". Has she improved at all for the final episode? No, there's just a descent into further debauchery, I'm afraid. I've finally shed my final inhibition doing this episode: I get my kit off completely at the end and walk off naked into the sea. It was actually very liberating. I can quite understand what these naturists get into. Will you miss Joanna? I'm just Mrs Nice But Dull in real life, so playing a self-obsessed, drinking, smoking nympho is a good antidote. I have to get my excitement somewhere. Was the atmosphere on set at Green Wing as zany as the show? It was just this anarchic place. There are some very witty people who do outrageous things, like walking down the corridor with the bottom cut out of their scrubs, as Julian Rhind-Tutt, who plays Mac, was wont to do. You're still well known for The Brittas Empire, even though it ended in 1997. Yes, someone sidled up to me just yesterday and said, \"I hope you don't mind me saying ... \" You can usually tell whether they are going to be a Green Wing person or a Brittas Empire person, but I got it wrong with him - he was a Brittas Empire person. People still love it and are very loyal to it. What television are you loyal to? I really enjoyed The Amazing Mrs Pritchard because it completely shook up your ideas about politics; it totally grabbed me. Also The Mitchell and Webb Look. I love their quiet, left-field humour. I'd stay in to watch them. Interview by Elisabeth Mahoney. Green Wing Special, Channel 4, Thursday, 10pm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
