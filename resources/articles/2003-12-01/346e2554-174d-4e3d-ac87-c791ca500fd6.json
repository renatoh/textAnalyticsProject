We know that they are good for us, and good to eat, too, not to mention wonderful to cook with. But suddenly cod is off the menu because there aren't enough of them, and much the same goes for haddock. Many people are worried about farmed salmon, too, not least all the chemicals they're treated with. As a chef, I really can't recommend cooking with them - they just don't have the texture or flavour of the real thing - but there aren't many of the real thing (ie, wild salmon) around, either. Organic farmed salmon can be pretty good, however, and makes a decent enough substitute. And then there are turbot, halibut, sole and monkfish, but they are very expensive, and there's sea bass, of course, although most of that is farmed these days. Anyway, those are all fancy restaurant fish. Why not give a thought to some of our more common, and cheaper, native fish? When I was growing up, about the only fish I ever came across were sardines - out of a tin. But since then I've learned the joys of whiting, with its delicate, white, flaky flesh, and gurnard, which may be an ugly critter, but its long tail is mighty meaty, with an excellent texture and flavour. And then there's the fish that I've long loved, the mackerel. Mackerel is usually treated as a second-class fish in Britain, perhaps because it's relatively common, but over in France the great chefs, such as Alain Chapel and Joel Robuchon, have always treated it with the respect it deserves. For one thing, it is such a handsome fish, all bluey silver and as streamlined as a seagoing rocket - the bonito of northern waters, no less - and it is as good to eat as it is to look at, with a wonderful delicacy to go with its oily richness. When they are fresh from the sea and simply grilled to let some of the oils drain away, and served with a squeeze of lemon, they are a sensational fish. Do something really special to them, meanwhile, as in the recipe below, and they'll more than repay all the effort. The other fish I love is red mullet. It's quite a bit pricier than mackerel, so may be more of a special-occasion buy, but it has a unique, gamey flavour. Not for nothing is it known in some quarters as the woodcock of the sea. These days, the specimens on fishmongers' slabs may come from as far away as Brazil, but quite a lot are still caught off the Cornish coast, and these are as good as any, and no doubt fresher, too. Recipes serve six. Mackerel tart A long recipe, but worth the effort. The anchovy butter keeps well - it stores well in the freezer, too, and is good to have to hand to whisk into sauces, mayonnaise, or even to finish a risotto. For the court bouillon 125g carrots, peeled and finely sliced 50g celery, finely sliced 100g onions, peeled and finely sliced 15g shallots, peeled and finely sliced 1 whole head garlic, cut in half Bouquet garni comprising thyme, a bayleaf, two leaves of tarragon and some flat-leaf parsley 1 leek, white part only, finely sliced 2 white peppercorns, lightly crushed 3 coriander seeds 1 star anise 1 clove For the anchovy butter 40g anchovy fillets, salted 60g unsalted butter Lemon juice Salt and pepper For the tart 150g puff pastry 50g unsalted butter* 6 medium vine-ripened tomatoes 1 clove garlic 40ml extra-virgin olive oil 150g smoked mackerel fillet 150ml double cream 1 lemon, juiced 1 small bunch chervil 15 leaves flat parsley 2 tarragon leaves 20 chives 3 medium mackerel, filleted First, make the court bouillon. Combine all the ingredients in a large casserole and cover with cold water. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for four minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside until needed. You'll need a litre of it for this dish - save any leftovers for something else, such as a vegetable soup. For the anchovy butter, wash the anchovies to remove excess salt and pur\u00e9e in a liquidiser or with a pestle and mortar. Place the butter in a bowl and leave to soften. Cream the butter by beating with a wooden spoon, then incorporate the anchovies. Add a little lemon juice, season and finish by rubbing into a bowl through a fine-mesh sieve with the back of a spoon. Cover and refrigerate until needed - you'll use 100g of finished butter for the tart. Now get to grips with the tart itself. Roll out the pastry to a thickness of 1mm. Grease and lightly flour a 22cm tart mould. (Don't worry if you do not have one of these - instead, cut the pastry into a rectangle or square and simply bake it directly on an oven tray.) Prick the pastry with a fork and leave in the fridge for half an hour before cooking. Preheat the oven to 100C. Bring a pan of water to the boil and drop in the tomatoes for 10 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon and place in a bowl of cold water. When cool, peel and cut the tomatoes in half. Scoop out the seeds, place them in a strainer over a bowl and set aside. Peel and finely slice a clove of garlic. Coat the tomato halves with the olive oil and any juice drained from the seeds, season and place in the oven for an hour or so with a sliver of garlic on top of each piece. Now make a smoked mackerel mousse: place the smoked mackerel and cream in a mixer and blend for only as long as is needed to combine the two, otherwise the cream might split. Add lemon juice to taste, then keep in the fridge. Once the tomatoes are out of the oven, increase the temperature to 200C. Save any oil that the tomatoes have been cooked in. Chop the herbs and set aside. Crush the tomatoes in a bowl with a fork and mix in the herbs. Add the oil from the cooking and set aside. Place parchment paper over the pastry, cover with dried beans or coins, and bake for 10 minutes. Bring a litre of court bouillon to the boil, then remove from the heat. Leave to cool for 10 minutes, then drop in the mackerel fillets. Leave to poach gently in the cooling court bouillon. Remove the tart base from the oven and spread with the smoked mackerel mousse. Place the poached mackerel fillets on top and cover with the tomato mixture. Cook in the oven for five to 10 minutes, then serve hot with the following sauce on the side. To make the sauce, place three to four dessertspoons of court bouillon in a small casserole and bring to the boil. Dice the anchovy butter. Remove the pan from the heat, making sure that there are still three dessertspoons of liquid left. Gradually add the pieces of butter, swirling the pan to emulsify: it might be necessary to return the pan to the heat for a few seconds, but take care not to let the liquid boil. Escabeche of red mullet Escabeche is a dish of Spanish origin and the basic principle is a cold, or room-temperature, marinade for cooked food, be it fish, as in this recipe, or meat. The word derives from cabeza, meaning head, and describes the fact that fish are traditionally marinated de-headed. There are many versions of this recipe, and it can be adapted according both to taste and what is to hand in the kitchen. This recipe calls for a lot of olive oil, but there is obviously a cost issue with this (groundnut oil is a good substitute). 1 generous pinch saffron 750ml olive oil 1 tbsp plain flour 6 large red mullet (ie, one per person), scaled, gutted and heads removed 100g carrot, peeled and finely sliced 100g onion, peeled and finely sliced 12 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced 1 lemon 1 small bunch flat-leaf parsley 3 bayleaves 3 sprigs thyme 1 tsp coriander seeds 2 cloves 1 star anise 1 tsp paprika 2 small red chillies 1 tsp white peppercorns Salt and pepper 30ml sherry vinegar 100ml white-wine vinegar 15ml water Tomato ketchup Worcestershire sauce Pour a little hot water on to the saffron threads and leave to infuse. Heat the olive oil in a deep-fat fryer to 180C. Sieve the flour on to a plate, season generously and use this to coat the fish. Tap off any excess flour, then drop the fish into the hot oil for a few minutes - a fish big enough to serve one person will take four to five minutes (you may only be able to buy smaller fish, in which case serve two to three a person, and cook for two minutes or so). Remove from the pan and drain on kitchen paper. Place the fish on a large serving plate and set aside. Carefully remove 500ml of the hot oil from the fryer. Pour this into a large, heavy-based casserole and add the carrot, onion and garlic, lemon, herbs and spices. Simmer the mixture over low heat for 20 minutes. Add the vinegars and water, bring to the boil, cook for three to four minutes, then stir in the ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and infused saffron. Cook for another five minutes, then remove the pan from the heat and leave to cool for half an hour. Pour this marinade over the fish and place in the fridge for a few hours before serving. Serve the fish with some of the dressing and aromatic vegetables \u00b7 Heston Blumenthal is the chef/ proprietor of the Fat Duck, in Bray, Berkshire."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
