The prop's club the Sydney Roosters are likely to insist he has surgery on a wrist injury this autumn to be fit for the 2007 season. \"I love to play for my country and to miss out will be disappointing,\" said Morley, who is set to sign a new contract with the Roosters. Morley's club team-mate Brett Finch kicked a drop goal for New South Wales to snatch a 17-16 win over Queensland in the first State of Origin match in Sydney yesterday. Melbourne Storm have expressed an interest in the Great Britain centre Chev Walker, who is to leave Leeds at the end of the season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
