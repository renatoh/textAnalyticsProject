The results, published in the international journal PLOS Medicine, have been released less than three months before the transition to the new national cervical cancer screening program that eliminates the need for women to have a pap smear every two years. From 1 December, women from the age of 25, instead of 18, will be required to have a five-yearly HPV test, replacing the two-yearly pap test. Previous estimates have suggested the new screening program would lower cervical cancer incidence and mortality by at least 20% owing to the more accurate test. But until now it had not been tested among women with a high uptake of the HPV vaccine. To examine its effectives, researchers at Cancer Council NSW and the Victorian Cytology Service compared the detection rates of high-grade cervical abnormalities with the pap test among 5,000 women aged 25 to 64. The women attended a routine screening at 47 participating clinics in Victoria. They were randomly assigned to either have a five-yearly HPV screening test or a 2.5-yearly liquid-based cytology screening (pap test). The study found that compared with the Pap test, HPV screening \u201csignificantly\u201d increased detection of high-grade precancerous cervical lesions among those who had been vaccinated. The overall detection rate was 0.1% versus 2.7%, respectively. \u201cThese findings provide initial support for the implementation of primary HPV screening in vaccinated populations,\u201d the authors wrote. Canfell says increased detection means greater longer-term protection against the development of invasive cancer. \u201cThis adds to existing evidence about how much more accurate and effective HPV screening is,\u201d she said. \u201cWe now have a superior method for detecting not just the virus that causes cervical cancer, but also high-grade abnormalities.\u201d The second phase of the Compass trial is recruiting and hopes to have more than 120,000 participants."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
