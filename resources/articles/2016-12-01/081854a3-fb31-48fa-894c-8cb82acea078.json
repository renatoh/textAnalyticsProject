Obama also used his final press conference of 2016 to criticize the media for its coverage of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, insisting \u201cI don\u2019t think she was treated fairly during the election.\u201d In a session which was also dominated by questions over Syria, the outgoing president said he had \u201cgreat confidence\u201d in the the intelligence agencies\u2019 assessment \u201cthat the Russians carried out this hack\u201d. Blaming Moscow for hacking the Democratic National Committee and the email account of Clinton\u2019s campaign chief, John Podesta, he said he wanted the report he has ordered into the affair out before he leaves office on 20 January. He dodged whether Putin personally directed the operations but pointedly noted \u201cnot much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin\u201d. The president said that he had told his Russian counterpart in person in September \u201cto cut it out\u201d with regard to hacks to influence the election and added \u201cthere were going to be some serious consequences if he did not\u201d. Obama thought that this intervention was at least somewhat successful as \u201cwe did not see further tampering of the election process. But the leaks through WikiLeaks had already occurred\u201d. Obama repeatedly weighed in on what he saw as increased polarization in the United States. \u201cOver a third of Republican voters approve of Vladimir Putin, the former head of the KGB. Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave. How did that happen?\u201d Obama said he believed that unless events were viewed through a less partisan framework \u201cwe\u2019re going to continue to be vulnerable to foreign influence because we\u2019ve lost track of what it is that we\u2019re about and what we stand for\u201d. He concluded that there was no evidence of wrongdoing in the way the election was tallied, adding that \u201cthe votes that were cast were counted, they were counted appropriately\u201d. Turning to his own relationship with President-elect Donald Trump, he said he had last spoken to him a few days ago in a \u201ccordial\u201d conversation. Obama said he gave Trump \u201cspecific suggestions about \u2026 maintaining the effectiveness, integrity, cohesion of the office, our various democratic institutions\u201d. However, turning to the political faultline in the US, he said: \u201cWhat I worry about \u2013 more than anything \u2013 is the degree to which, because of the fierceness, because of the partisan battle, you start to see certain folks in the Republican party and Republican voters suddenly finding a government and individuals who stand contrary to everything that we stand for, as being OK, because \u2018that\u2019s how much we dislike Democrats\u2019.\u201d He added that American vulnerability to cyber-attacks was \u201cdirectly related to how divided, partisan and dysfunctional our political process is\u201d. He added: \u201cIf fake news is being released by some foreign government that is almost identical to reports that are being issued through partisan news venues, then it\u2019s not surprising that that foreign propaganda will have a greater effect, because it doesn\u2019t seem so far-fetched.\u201d As Obama put it Russia \u201cdoesn\u2019t produce anything that anybody wants to buy except oil and gas and arms. They don\u2019t innovate.\u201d However, he warned \u201cthey can impact us if we abandon our values. Mr Putin can weaken us just like he\u2019s trying to weaken Europe if we start buying into notions that it\u2019s OK to intimidate the press, or lock up dissidents, or discriminate against people because of their faith or what they look like.\u201d Obama also criticized media coverage of hacked emails from the DNC and Podesta. \u201cThis was an obsession that dominated the news coverage,\u201d he said. He asked mournfully how the election \u201cwith so many big issues at stake and such a contrast between the candidates came to be dominated by a bunch of these leaks\u201d. Speaking before he set off for a family Christmas vacation in Hawaii, Obama also expressed the hope that hacks could be examined in a non-partisan manner and urged President-elect Trump to welcome \u201ca bipartisan independent process\u201d to investigate them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
