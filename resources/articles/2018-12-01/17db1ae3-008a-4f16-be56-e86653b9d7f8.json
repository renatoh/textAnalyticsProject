Can the man in the booth just let her out, please? He cannot. So she has to leave her car, get an expensive taxi home, pick up the kids and get the car the next day. And so begins the unravelling of life when catastrophe hits and nobody, really, cares. Care was written by Jimmy McGovern and Gillian Juckes. The story of a single mother, Jenny, trying to look after her mum \u2013 after she has a stroke and develops dementia, and the health authority refuses to take responsibility when she is discharged after three weeks in hospital \u2013 is loosely based on Juckes\u2019 real-life experiences. The disorientation and bafflement of Jenny and her sister as they negotiate the aftermath of Mary\u2019s \u201cevent\u201d is \u2013 like the rest of Care \u2013 beautifully, delicately observed. Nothing in the 90-minute drama is wildly dramatic. It chooses instead to replicate that awful, gradual, but remorseless immersion in a new reality that all those visited by tragedy and grief will recognise. At the supposed progress meeting at the hospital, Jenny and her sister, Claire, can\u2019t believe that they are planning on sending her home. \u201cShe\u2019s making no sense,\u201d says Claire (Mary\u2019s indecipherable speech is translated on screen in faint, floating subtitles). \u201cShe\u2019s eating metal, and she thinks anything that moves is her dead husband!\u201d But medical treatment can do no more for her, there are no places in local rehabilitation centres \u2013 who wouldn\u2019t take her anyway, as she is ambulant \u2013 and the hospital needs her bed. If she passes the \u201ckitchen test\u201d \u2013 boiling a kettle and making a cup of tea on her own \u2013 she will be discharged. And so, in a horrible inversion of normality again that all those who have been there will flinch from in remembered pain, her daughters sit watching their mother with the tester and hoping that she can no longer make herself tea. Mary eats the teabag. She gets a place in a care home. The underfunded, understaffed care home loses her on the first night and she is found wandering the streets and brought to Jenny\u2019s by the police. The die is cast. Jenny takes her in and becomes her carer, the government allowance not making up for the wage she had when able to work. Her shiftless ex-husband is no help, financially or otherwise, and nor \u2013 slightly less explicably or believably \u2013 is her sister, who is underdeveloped and inconsistent as a character. She forms (despite a first-class performance from Sinead Keenan) the only loose nut in an otherwise immaculately constructed vehicle for McGovern\u2019s latest social concern. Eventually, Jenny discovers by chance \u2013 it would be very expensive for the NHS if this information were more readily available \u2013 that Mary is entitled to something called a continuing healthcare package and, after an arduous application and appeal (which reveals a forged questionnaire designed to keep her off the books), Mary is approved for it. It may be Smith\u2019s finest work yet. She has just one overtly emotional scene as Jenny (when Claire says she can\u2019t take Mary back after her second stroke and Jenny shoots back that this is to stop Claire feeling guilty as she sees her sister doing all the work rather than out of concern for their mother). The rest of the time, she must somehow show us simply the unrelenting, unshowy, endlessly wearying grind of it all, the lack of time or energy to spare reacting to the heaping humiliations ill health brings to the sufferer and all around her, and the corrosive, compounding effects of grief on top of it all. And show us she does. It\u2019s a subtle, humane performance, and I hope it doesn\u2019t get overlooked by awards panels in favour of more eye-catching roles elsewhere. Steadman, too, bringing all her talent and experience to bear on avoiding the multiple traps an actor faced with such a part can fall into, is excellent, but it is unquestionably Smith who draws the viewer in and anchors the whole. Care has a Happy Valleyish recognition and appreciation of how women\u2019s lives so often work out; of how age brings with it more, not fewer, responsibilities. There\u2019s a narrowing, not broadening, of opportunities and their enforced ability to plough on in the absence of any alternative. It is a spare, tight, moving piece of drama that should force us all to care \u2013 about who will look after us in our old age, who will look after them and who will fund it all. We\u2019re none of us getting any younger, you know."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
