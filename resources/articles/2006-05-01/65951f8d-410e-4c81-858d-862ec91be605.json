It asserts that university employers are in a position to offer more than 12.6% over three years. At a packed employers' meeting yesterday, not a single vice-chancellor said they would be in a position to increase this offer. The academic unions' demand for an unrealistic, impossible 23% rise would mean redundancies; 12.6% is substantially more than the one-third of the additional fee income the academic unions originally demanded. Campuses are not paralysed \"all over the country\" and most of exams are going ahead. Your assertion that employers have \"done little to settle this dispute\" is also inaccurate. From the outset employers have worked first to avoid and now to end the damage to students caused by this action. Professor Drummond Bone Vice-chancellor, University of Liverpool; president of Universities UK Professor John Craven Vice-chancellor, Portsmouth University; convener of the non-aligned universities Professor Michael Driscoll Vice-chancellor, Middlesex University; chair of the CMU Group Professor David Eastwood Vice-chancellor, University of East Anglia; chair of the 1994 Group Professor Michael Sterling Vice-chancellor; University of Birmingham, chair of the Russell Group Natfhe members will be delighted you agree that \"the case for a big increase in academic pay is unanswerable\". You are also right to point out that vice-chancellors appear to have sleepwalked into this dispute, instead of negotiating many months ago when our claim was submitted. Unfortunately, instead of focusing on crafting a new offer that Natfhe and our AUT colleagues could recommend to members, vice-chancellors are escalating the dispute with punitive fines and complete docking of pay. We have three questions we suggest students and parents ask those who manage our universities and colleges. Why is it not possible to make a more sensible pay offer given the very substantial increase in funding to the sector over the next three years? How do they think punitive pay deductions and complete stoppage of pay will help the dispute? Who do they think is going to mark the exam scripts if those whose job this is are not going to be paid for it? Roger Kline Head of higher education, Natfhe Newcastle University has already started setting exams that have not been written by module leaders who are on strike; mostly this has been done by heads of schools, who may or may not be qualified to do so. There is mounting protest among students, who are questioning the validity of such exams. The university line is that \"exams are going ahead as planned\". This is preposterous. Name and address supplied A solution would be to make current salaries cover the nine months of the academic year - a 33% rise at a stroke. Academics could then supplement their salaries in the other three months from charging their time on research grants, writing books or running summer schools. Those who choose to take a three month holiday would be rewarded appropriately.
