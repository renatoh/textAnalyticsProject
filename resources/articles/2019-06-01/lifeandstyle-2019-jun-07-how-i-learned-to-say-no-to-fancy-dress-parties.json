You see, they are costume people. All their parties are fancy dress. They enjoy spending time (and money) creating conceptual gladrags. They will attack a theme with aplomb. To their credit, they are quite good. A friend recently went to a \u201cnaughty but nice\u201d party dressed as a sexy bedside table. She even put a papier-mache lamp on top (it represented a \u201cone-night stand\u201d). Me? I can\u2019t bear the whole thing. I try to see the fun, but all I witness is pain: the humiliation of the commute dressed as an egg; the \u201cwacky\u201d photos that will stalk me indefinitely. If a party is about being carefree, then a costume does the opposite, locking me into my own personal prison. Too many times I\u2019ve found myself panicking in Costcutter about how to cobble an outfit together. Too many times I\u2019ve resigned myself to face paint and a toy tool belt, painting a white line across my face, praying people would believe me when I said I was Adam Ant during his lesser-known builder phase. I\u2019m sure the hosts wanted more. I wanted less. And so we accepted this limp compromise. The thing is, friendships in my 20s were demanding. I feared that by shirking the party, I\u2019d jeopardise them. Earning the displeasure of my peers seemed like hell, as did staying home and missing potential bonding moments. I was convinced it would mean being left out in the cold. I now know that any friendship so fragile that it can be destroyed by turning up in jeans can hardly be called a friendship. Those fleeting relationships are ones we\u2019re better off without. Now when the costume party invitation arrives, I do what\u2019s probably best for everyone: RSVP \u201cnot attending\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
