This is a concept set, based on the folk-influenced work of Ralph Vaughan Williams, the great composer who was also a dedicated collector of traditional songs and became president of the English Folk Song and Dance Society. He was an agnostic, but was invited to rework the melodies in The English Hymnal, published at the start of the last century, and also used traditional influences in his musical settings for the work of poets and writers he admired. It's an intriguing story, that could have been retold in the sleevenotes, but the songs here are a reminder of his powerful compositions. This set includes the sturdy hymns Come Down O Love Divine and At the Name of Jesus, along with his gently rousing treatment for William Morris's Snow in the Street, the drifting setting for Blake's Cradle Song, and that song of country contentment, Linden Lea. Maddy Prior is in fine voice (especially on her unaccompanied treatment of The Divine Image), while the five-piece Carnival Band add violin, mandolin, bassoon and additional vocals and sound pleasantly professional rather than inspired."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
