The Italian endured rare personal failure as England manager in South Africa where the team scraped through the group stage after three moribund performances before losing 4-1 to Germany in the first knock-out round. Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s team may have been convincing winners in Bloemfontein but Capello maintains the outcome would have been different had Frank Lampard\u2019s shot that hit the bar and crossed the line at 2-1 stood. Pressure for goalline technology intensified after the failure of the Uruguay referee Jorge Larrionda and his assistant Mauricio Espinosa to spot that Lampard\u2019s effort had landed more than a foot behind Manuel Neuer\u2019s line and the facility is now in place in Brazil. And the Russia manager, speaking before his side\u2019s opening game against South Korea in Cuiaba on Tuesday, says his last World Cup experience should be considered in that context. Asked if his approach to this World Cup had changed as a consequence of England\u2019s failure in South Africa, the 67-year-old on \u00a36.7m a year replied; \u201cI haven\u2019t changed things, it is Fifa that have changed things. It was my England team that was punished four years ago and everybody knows what a great difference in makes in a game when you go from 2-0 to 2-2. When I think about four years ago I go back to that result. What happened then helped the case for goalline technology but it was England who paid the price for the technology that is now out there.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
