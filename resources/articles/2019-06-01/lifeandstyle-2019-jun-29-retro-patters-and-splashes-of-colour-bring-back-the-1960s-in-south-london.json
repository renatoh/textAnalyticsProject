Exhibit A: Robin Day\u2019s 1964 Forum sofa, pioneering in its mix of oak and steel. There are folkish wooden dolls by the architect and designer Alexander Girard \u2013 \u201canother hero of ours\u201d. Next, a prized set of tumblers made as commemorative souvenirs for the New York World\u2019s Fair of 1964. \u201cIt was a showcase for midcentury architecture and design: the last hurrah for the American dream before the realities of the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War set in,\u201d says Mark, warming to this theme. \u201cEach one is a piece of social history.\u201d They wish their south London home was an example of enlightened, postwar architecture, too. \u201cWe\u2019d always imagined ourselves living on a 1960s estate with a shared garden and garage for the Mini, that\u2019s how geeky we are,\u201d says Keith. But modernist houses are rare so the couple, co-founders of interiors business Mini Moderns, settled for this contemporary townhouse instead. Tucked behind a Victorian terrace, on the site of a former print factory, the three-storey property is part of a development of 15 live-work houses designed for the creative businesses \u2013 photographers, artists, designers \u2013 who give the mews its communal feel. Flowers and sculptures sit outside front doors; in summer the ground-floor double-height studios turn into party venues. \u201cWe like the friendly atmosphere. We\u2019ll water our neighbour\u2019s lavender when she\u2019s away and friends take in deliveries if we\u2019re out,\u201d says Keith. From the studio, we head upstairs to the three-bedroom duplex where Burt Bacharach drifts from the speakers and light streams in through the wide windows. \u201cWhen we moved in this was a featureless, magnolia box with horrible surfaces. So we said right, let\u2019s eradicate the worst bits and give it a 1960s townhouse vibe,\u201d says Mark. Out went the carpet (\u201ca cat magnet\u201d), replaced by wooden floors painted grey for a vintage Linoleum effect. New sliding doors lead to the compact, monochrome bathrooms. The couple insist they are not purists (a bank of sleek fitted wardrobes is from Ikea), but almost all the furnishings here have provenance. In the bedroom, George Nelson\u2019s 1948 Bubble pendant glows next to a chair designed by Ernest Race for the Festival of Britain in 1951. Inspired by another design idol, Gio Ponti, they also designed the floating ply bedside tables and strikingly tall headboard that adds to the streamlined feel. Initially, they painted everything white, but gradually the house has become a testing ground for their midcentury\u2013feel designs. \u201cIf we can live with them, then at least we know other people can, too,\u201d says Mark. The pattern-loving couple grew up in Yorkshire and all their designs spring from the \u201cwarmth\u201d of shared memories. \u201cWe never met as teenagers, but we did all the same things. We watched 1960s films on Channel 4. At weekends we went to junk shops and spent our pocket money on 1950s wire fruit bowls or painterly curtains which we\u2019d turn into shirts for Saturday nights out,\u201d reminisces Keith. The blue and white waves of their \u201cWhitby\u201d wallpaper evokes summer holidays on the Yorkshire coast (\u201cSpain hadn\u2019t been discovered then\u201d), while \u201cArt Room\u201d, adorned with oil lamps and African masks, pays homage to sixth-form still-life classes. In the hallway, graphic \u201cPluto\u201d (inspired by dazzle camouflage) clambers over the walls and ceiling, adding to the feel that you have tumbled into an Op Art painting. When they launched in the mid-1990s, some of the duo\u2019s earliest clients included the Southbank Centre, Radio 6 and John Lewis. Now their vibrant Paisley design, inspired by Hanif Kureishi\u2019s Buddha of Suburbia, hangs in the permanent collection at the Whitworth Art Gallery in Manchester. Wallpaper also brings colour to the staircase, which rises to the top floor. Like that yearned-for 1960s house, this is the main living area: kitchen, dining area and sitting room flow towards the long terrace. Here, walls were removed to open up the boxy landing. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take much to make the place feel much sleeker,\u201d says Keith. New doors, in a mix of plywood and paint, transformed the developer kitchen into their design ideal: \u201cFrank Guille\u2019s 1958 kitchen for the British manufacturer Kandya to be precise.\u201d The G-Plan sideboard belonged to Keith\u2019s mum (\u201cI was too late to save the rest, which went on the bonfire,\u201d he laments), the clunky 1970s Trimphone still rings \u201cvery loudly\u201d and the compact Danish dining table, bought at the annual Midcentury Modern Show in Dulwich, southeast London, flips open to seat eight: \u201cAnother example of good design.\u201d That teenage compulsion to rummage through market stalls for overlooked gems has never left them. Pocket-money finds \u2013 Susie Cooper cups, orange-spined Penguin books \u2013 have been joined by more sophisticated purchases, such as 1970s West German studio and sculptural crockery, designed by Susan Williams-Ellis for Portmeirion in the 1960s. \u201cWe only collect olive green.\u201d Their favourite pieces are displayed on the flat-pack \u201cString\u201d shelving which has travelled with them from previous, rented homes. \u201cThe system was designed in 1949 by husband-and-wife team Nils and Kajsa Strinning for a publisher who was looking for an affordable, easy-to-install way to display books,\u201d says Keith. \u201cIt\u2019s never been out of production since \u2013 which is just the kind of anecdote we like.\u201d Mid-Century Modern Living, by Keith Stephenson and Mark Hampshire, is published by Kyle Books (\u00a320).
