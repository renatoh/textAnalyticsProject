Tens of thousands turned out in Washington, New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and hundreds of other cities across the US and the world. Many women wore pink knit \u201cpussy hats\u201d, an enduring symbol of the Women\u2019s March and the so-called \u201cresistance\u201d to Trump. In Washington, where the federal government was shut down amid gridlock in Congress, the steps of the Lincoln Memorial were dotted with pink hats and handmade placards. A group of protesters held large block letters to spell \u201cimpeach\u201d. The rally stretched along the national mall towards the Washington monument. A few dozen daring protesters watched the rally from atop the frozen reflecting pool. Under a warm sun, the pool began to melt. Several people had to be fished from the icy water. Crowds were generally upbeat, basking in the sunshine. Activists said they were encouraged by a string of liberal victories in the past year, including the election of Democrats in state elections in Alabama and Virginia. But there was also a sense of challenges still ahead, especially as the 2018 congressional midterms approach. \u201cI think maybe there\u2019s more anger this year,\u201d said Liz Weiderhold, a teacher in Virginia who said she marched in Washington last year as well. \u201cYou can feel the pressure in the pressure cooker. We\u2019re more exasperated now that he\u2019s been in office for more than a year and we\u2019ve seen what a disaster it\u2019s been.\u201d The 2017 protest touched off a year of political resistance to Trump\u2019s presidency often led by women. As speakers including the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, and Democratic senator Kirsten Gillibrand noted during their remarks to the Washington rally on Saturday, women are running for office in record numbers and aiding grassroots efforts to protest, flooding lawmakers with calls and emails. \u201cIf you care about winning back the House, flipping the Senate, then I urge you to support Democratic candidates all across the country,\u201d Gillibrand said, to booming cheers. \u201cThis is our moment to stand tall, to fight back and be heard.\u201d The year of protest has also seen sweeping cultural and political change around sexual harassment in the workplace, through the social-media-fuelled #MeToo movement. Organizers said they hoped the anniversary rallies and marches would help galvanize the movement ahead of the 2018 midterms. \u201cWe started 2017 with perpetual outrage and now we are at the moment when we have perpetual outrage plus a plan in place for 2018,\u201d Linda Sarsour, a co-chair of the Women\u2019s March, told the Guardian. Last year, embarrassed that the Women\u2019s March in Washington dwarfed attendance for his inauguration the day before, Trump forced the then press secretary, Sean Spicer, to falsely claim the president drew the \u201clargest audience to witness an inauguration, period\u201d. This year \u2013 if facetiously \u2013 Trump sought to embrace the marches. \u201cBeautiful weather all over our great country, a perfect day for all Women to March,\u201d the president tweeted from the White House on Saturday afternoon, as frantic negotiations with congressional leaders over the shutdown continued. \u201cGet out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months. Lowest female unemployment in 18 years!\u201d Trump was not supposed to be in Washington to witness the march. He had planned to be 1,000 miles away at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, celebrating the anniversary at a lavish party with Republican donors. Outside the White House, marchers carried wry placards. Some turned Trump\u2019s recent reported derogatory comment about \u201cshithole countries\u201d in Africa and Central America back on him, while others accused him of being Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cpuppet\u201d or begged him to tweet less, especially about North Korea. In New York, thousands of people marched through Manhattan. The streets on the west side of Central Park were packed. One of the closest subway stations to the start of the march was Columbus Circle \u2013 right by the Trump International Hotel and Tower. Lots of people posed for pictures in front of the Trump sign, among them Deborah Paray and Marteen Dinzes, both from New Jersey. They had fashioned a sign depicting Trump with a large hole for a mouth. \u201cA lot of shit comes out of that hole,\u201d Dinzes said. In Los Angeles, protesters were greeted by shouting vendors selling buttons, pink \u201cpussy hats\u201d and branded scarfs. One vendor, Walter Lopez, said he woke up at 3am to get to the march from Redondo Beach. \u201cI\u2019m impressed by how many people showed up,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m all about women, people, human beings. It\u2019s a good thing I woke up.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
