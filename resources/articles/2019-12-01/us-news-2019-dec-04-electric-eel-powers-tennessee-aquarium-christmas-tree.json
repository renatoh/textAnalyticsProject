The flashy fish goes by the name of Miguel Wattson and has his own Twitter account, @EelectricMiguel. A special system connected to Miguel\u2019s tank enables his naturally occurring shocks to power strands of lights on a nearby tree, the aquarium said in a news statement. Miguel releases low-voltage blips of electricity when he is trying to find food, aquarist Kimberly Hurt said. That translates to a rapid, dim blinking of the Christmas lights. When he is eating or excited he emits higher voltage shocks which cause bigger flashes. Wattson\u2019s Twitter account allows him to share tweets generated by his sparky self, courtesy of coding by Tennessee Tech University\u2019s iCube center, an innovation unit for students and faculty. \u201cThey combined electrical engineering and emerging business communication to give the eel a voice,\u201d center director Kevin Liska said. In between Miguel\u2019s tweets boasting statements like \u201cSHAZAM!!!!\u201d and \u201cka-BLAMEROO!!!!!,\u201d a video posted to the account shows Miguel shaking in his tank as lights on the nearby tree sputter on and off. The aquarium hopes the Christmas tree will be a powerful appreciation for the often feared electric eel and underappreciated eels of all kinds. The lighting-up ceremony earlier this week \u2013 dubbed by some \u201cshocking around the Christmas tree\u201d \u2013 inspired a widespread glow of affection for Miguel and his extraordinary powers to illuminate can be seen in full effect from now until Christmas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
