In the past the club has been criticised for the public-school image of its ageing membership. However, in recent years it has been actively trying to attract younger skiers and their families to its ranks. As a result, the more mature of the club's 27,500 members - those aged over 60 - now find themselves excluded from joining 73 of its 133 week and weekend breaks that have been rebranded this winter under the Ski Freshtracks logo. Trips to the snow for the over-60s are now largely restricted to Peak Experience, a collection of week-long group holidays designed for the over 50s. One curious exception to this rule is the Haute Route, Europe's most notoriously demanding ski tour, which requires high levels of both fitness and stamina. The club allows older skiers to join this holiday, regardless of age. The club's clampdown comes at time when other organisations are openly courting the increasing number of \"grey\" skiers who have both the time and money to pursue their sport into old age. Tour operators such as Thomson, Crystal and Inghams all offer discounted lift passes to the over 60s. In the US, resorts have raised or even abolished the upper limits for reduced or free passes because of the increasing volume of retirement-age skiers. Caroline Stuart-Taylor, the 50-year-old chief executive of the Ski Club, insisted that plenty of holidays were still available for older skiers. She commented: \"People tend to slow down over 60, and they can no longer do the whole day at the same pace. \"From a social perspective, all the holidays work better because of the way we arrange them. The intention is not to discriminate but to provide people with holidays that are most suitable both on the skiing and the social side.\" However, she conceded that exceptions to the rule could be made. \"If the person has skied with a guide we know, I am willing to speak to that guide about their suitability.\" \u00b7 Nearly a quarter of skiers (23%) say the presence of marshalls with powers to breathalyse and fine people on the slopes will not stop them drinking, according to a survey of nearly 2,000 by Churchill Insurance. The \"Piste Police\" have been introduced in Italy and Austria to help cut the number of accidents caused by drunkeness, speeding and off-piste skiing. The new regulations led to a 10% reduction in accidents (about 1,500 people) in Italy last season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
