Rush and his collaborator Bert Cole are sanguine as they take in the view, but I\u2019m clutching the railings, summer breeze blowing through the jasmine of my freaking mind. From its birth in 1975 until it was rendered obsolete by bigger kit, this crane lifted loads at Avonmouth Docks in Bristol. Rush and Cole bought it for an undisclosed sum, chopped it into two pieces, and trucked them 30 miles to Glastonbury. \u201cIt was quite a performance,\u201d laughs Cole. \u201cPolice escort and everything. Then we had to put it together again.\u201d He points out all the boltings and weldings, as well as the 10-metre-deep pilings that hold this beautifully incongruous monstrosity in place. Nice, though appreciating the workmanship is hardly a cure for my vertigo. This crane will form the centrepiece of the Arcadia art collective\u2019s latest installation, Pangea, which premieres this week at Glastonbury and will remain on the site for four years. It is the pair\u2019s response to the question: how do you top a 50-tonne, fire-breathing spider? The Spider bewitched festival-goers for the best part of a decade. Michael Eavis, who created the festival, remembers being approached by Rush and Cole. \u201cThey said, \u2018Give us a cheque for \u00a320,000.\u2019 I said, \u2018But I don\u2019t know who you are.\u2019 They said, \u2018We\u2019ll do a show \u2013 and if it falls on its face, you\u2019ll get at least \u00a310,000 back.\u2019 It didn\u2019t go wrong, did it?\u201d Originally a tripod, the creature evolved into an arachnid. \u201cAnatomically, it was very incorrect,\u201d says Rush. \u201cReal spiders don\u2019t have built-in fire cannons.\u201d Nor do they have abdomens made from jet engines, legs from Customs scanning machines, claws from log-grabbers, and bodies from helicopter tails. \u201cWe wanted to change the festival experience,\u201d says Rush. \u201cInstead of looking at the backs of people\u2019s heads while a band plays, you\u2019re part of the action.\u201d By 2015, the Spider had evolved into a multimedia spectacular called Metamorphosis, firing flames and laser beams up into the sky. The DJ stood in the abdomen/control booth, which hung above the dancefloor, while acrobats, dancers, performers and puppeteers shimmied up, over and across the creature on tightropes, as Tesla coils generated four-million-volt lightning arcs. Although it takes four days to set up and four articulated lorries to transport, the Spider has toured to Miami, Bangkok, Seoul, Taipei and Perth. \u201cThe Australian trip blew my mind,\u201d says Rush. \u201cThe indigenous Australians we met told us their ancestors performed an ancient song about the spider spirit, how its web symbolised community connectedness. They hadn\u2019t performed it since 1901, after a member of the British royal family was rude about it.\u201d They brought members of the Noongar tribe over to perform this song when the Spider visited London\u2019s Olympic Park last year. \u201cIt was a wonderful moment,\u201d says Rush. From a platform on the Pangea crane, DJs including Carl Cox and Fatboy Slim will play to a 60,000-strong crowd, on a dancefloor ringed by huge speakers. \u201cIt\u2019ll be like a giant audio Stonehenge,\u201d Rush says. Flames will shoot from the speakers into the night sky. Isn\u2019t that a health and safety nightmare? \u201cIt certainly is,\u201d says Cole. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been dealing with the challenge of atomisation for a long time.\u201d Eh? \u201cYou\u2019ve got to atomise the fuel before you set fire to it, so that you burn all of it and none of it comes back down afterwards.\u201d Greasy machinery, millions of volts, flames rising higher than the surrounding hills, a generator running on recycled chip fat, tens of thousands of revellers who perhaps aren\u2019t all sober \u2013 are they worried things could go wrong? \u201cWe run a tight ship,\u201d says Rush. \u201cPeople are always amazed when they visit us during the festival. It\u2019s a very sober scene. Not at all what you expect from a rave. We\u2019re all in the zone. Well, until Monday morning.\u201d From 30 metres up, we survey Pangea\u2019s realm. To the south is Dorset, to the north Bristol, and five miles to the west is Glastonbury Tor, surmounting the legendary Arthurian fairy-land of Avalon. \u201cIf you climb up that ladder to the top of the crane, you can see the sea,\u201d says Rush. \u201cThere\u2019s a really amazing view to the Bristol Channel and Avonmouth.\u201d I look up at the rickety ladder, rising another 20 metres into the sky, and take his word for it. Pangea, Rush says, is named after \u201cthe prehistoric supercontinent where every land on Earth was one and the future had yet to be written. It was a time of possibility.\u201d A blank canvas? \u201cYeah, that fits with our thinking. We have no idea whether it will work.\u201d Before we return to Earth, I sit in the driver\u2019s seat of the crane, wondering what sort of carnage I could wreak with the touch of a button. \u201cWe got in touch with a guy who was an apprentice when the crane came into service,\u201d says Cole. \u201cHe\u2019s been teaching us how to operate it.\u201d Maybe, I suggest, the crane could lift dancers and take them on 360-degree rides. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly thinking about having performers dangling from the boom,\u201d says Rush. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what it will become over the next few years,\u201d adds Cole. \u201cThat\u2019s the thrill.\u201d \u2022 Glastonbury runs until 30 June.
