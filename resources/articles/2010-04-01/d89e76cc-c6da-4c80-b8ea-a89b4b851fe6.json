Has the nanny state, in other words, been responsible for the fact that your nan has been stuck in Las Palmas? With an end to the ban in prospect because the eruption is subsiding, this is what some airline executives and a number of grumpy commentators have come close to saying. The truth lies elsewhere, and, while it does not reflect that well on governments here or on the aviation industry, this has not been a simple case of overreaction. We remain in a state of confusion over the threat posed by volcanic ash because the basic scientific and technical work needed to measure it more accurately has not yet been done. It has not been done in part because it has not been funded, and in part because competing scientific projects have taken precedence. There is as a result considerable uncertainty on the two fundamental questions of how to gauge more exactly the amount of volcanic material in the atmosphere, and, having gauged it, how to decide what amount aircraft can cope with and what presents a serious danger. That danger was first dramatised in 1982 when a British Airways 747 lost its engines flying over Indonesia during an eruption. Over the years since, an international institutional framework for early warning of volcanic events has been put in place, but progress on the satellite instrumentation needed for accurate measurement of volcanic clouds and on the testing of jet engines to see what levels they can tolerate has not been so rapid. It is perhaps symptomatic that Dr Fred Prata, one of the world's leading experts on the measurement of volcanic eruptions and clouds, who now works with the Norwegian Institute for Air Research, was made redundant by his old employers, the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Organisation, three years ago. His speciality was apparently not seen as a priority. In Europe, we have not yet got purpose-designed instrumentation for volcanic dust on our satellites, instead making do with less than optimal instruments adapted from other work. Manufacturers, meanwhile, will not set thresholds for their engines, presumably because they have not done the research needed to know what those thresholds are. Now that we have all had a lesson in the costs of ignorance, the necessary research will no doubt be pushed forward and the funding swiftly found. Until then the authorities will have little choice but to operate on a worst case basis."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
