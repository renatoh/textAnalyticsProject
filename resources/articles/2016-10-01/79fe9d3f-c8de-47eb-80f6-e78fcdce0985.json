But before anyone had time to process the implications on Friday, another story broke, and the immolation of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign became the only subject anyone wanted to discuss. Nonetheless, this new low point in US-Russian relations will be a major challenge for Hillary Clinton in the increasingly likely event that she is inaugurated in January. In the past few weeks, the already poor US-Russia relationship has taken a dramatic turn for the worse. In Syria, Russia has helped launched a brutal assault on the opposition stronghold in eastern Aleppo, shocking the world and prompting the secretary of state, John Kerry, to suspend bilateral ceasefire efforts with Moscow. Russia, in turn, has suspended participation in a nuclear arms treaty. Its government also lodged a complaint against a UN official who condemned alleged Kremlin ties with the Trump campaign, which have been frequently suspected though never proven. All of this forms a backdrop for Friday\u2019s unprecedented joint statement by the director of national intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security, which stated that the US intelligence community \u201cis confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations\u201d. The real news here is the announcement, since its underlying substance has been suspected for months. Ever since WikiLeaks released hacked DNC emails on the eve of last summer\u2019s Democratic convention in Philadelphia, revealing the party\u2019s apparent bias against Bernie Sanders, US officials have pointed to Russia as the likely culprit. The Clinton campaign has encouraged this by implying that Trump is a Kremlin agent and that Vladimir Putin is trying to install him in the White House. But as I wrote for the Guardian last month, this isn\u2019t necessarily Putin\u2019s plan. There are plenty of reasons for Russia to interfere with the US political process short of attempting to select a president, especially one as erratic as Trump. At the very least, such tactics are consistent with the disinformation campaigns Russia has launched in neighboring countries such as Ukraine and Estonia, spreading confusion and undermining faith in the legitimacy of democratic institutions. And if Clinton becomes president, Russia, if it is WikiLeaks\u2019 source, has already demonstrated an ability to cause her headaches by releasing damaging information about her at inopportune moments. Clinton is often accused of being a hawk on Russia, and certainly Putin seems to perceive her that way. When Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, Clinton did not mince words, comparing Putin\u2019s actions to \u201cwhat Hitler did back in the 30s\u201d, a comment that was not received well in a country that sacrificed millions of people to defeat the Nazis. But Clinton\u2019s history with Russia is more complicated than that. As Barack Obama\u2019s secretary of state, Clinton spearheaded a good-faith attempt to reset relations with Russia, which was taking a four-year break from Putin\u2019s presidency under the seemingly more liberal Dmitri Medvedev. As Michael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia, told me last year, the reset broke down in part because of the 2011 US intervention in Libya, for which Clinton was a leading advocate and which Medvedev declined to veto in the UN security council. The overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi infuriated Putin, who returned to the presidency in 2012 and has clashed with the Obama administration on foreign policy ever since. Clinton\u2019s foreign policy is mostly consistent with Obama\u2019s. A notable exception is Syria; as she told the Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg in 2014, she advocated for more US support for the Syrian opposition as secretary of state, and there is reason to think she will be more confrontational in Syria than Obama has been. Regardless of one\u2019s feelings about the Syrian conflict itself, this approach will inevitably face pushback from Russia, which is deeply invested in preserving Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime. Clinton will take office facing an already hostile Russia, and it\u2019s very possible things will get worse from there. Meanwhile, cyberwarfare between the US and Russia could become the new normal. Both countries have plenty of officials with potentially damaging secrets just waiting to be exposed. Absent any pretense of cooperation, the hacks could quickly escalate, and neither Clinton nor Putin may be prepared for the fallout."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
