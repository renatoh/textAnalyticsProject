With the Spanish prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, threatening to veto May\u2019s deal at Sunday\u2019s leaders\u2019 summit in Brussels, the British government was forced to publicly concede on Saturday that Gibraltar will not necessarily be covered by a future trade deal. S\u00e1nchez immediately claimed that he would use the concession to force the British to open talks on joint sovereignty of Gibraltar, over which Spain has had a claim since the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. He said: \u201cOnce the UK has left the EU, Gibraltar\u2019s political, legal and even geographic relationship with the EU will go through Spain \u2026 \u201cSpain will be a fundamental pillar of the relationship between Gibraltar and the EU as a whole. \u201cWhen it comes to the future political declaration, the European council and the European Commission have backed Spain\u2019s position, and backed it as never before. \u201cIn these fundamental future negotiations, we\u2019re going to have to talk about joint sovereignty and many other things with the UK.\u201d Madrid has always insisted that Gibraltar should be covered by agreements struck between the EU and the UK only with Spain\u2019s consent. The Spanish government was furious when an article in the withdrawal agreement appeared to suggest that any future trade deal would also cover the disputed territory. Downing Street was accused of \u201cacting under the cover of darkness\u201d in inserting the clause, known as article 184. S\u00e1nchez had warned that he would snub Sunday\u2019s Brexit summit unless he had written and public assurances from Downing Street that Spain would have a crucial say in Gibraltar\u2019s future. That reassurance came on Saturday in the form of a letter from the British ambassador to the EU, Sir Tim Barrow, laying out the British government\u2019s acceptance that the withdrawal agreement \u201cimposes no obligations regarding the territorial scope\u201d of a future trade deal. The move sparked anger among Brexiters. Stewart Jackson, former chief of staff to ex-Brexit secretary David Davis, said: \u201cThe Gibraltar surrender may be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back. It betrays a fundamental unwillingness to listen or even understand [May\u2019s] own party, for whom the Rock is totemic, and is a very foolish thing to have done. \u201cShe believes that even the worst deal is acceptable. It isn\u2019t.\u201d Clare Moody, Labour\u2019s MEP for Gibraltar, said: \u201cWhat is remarkable is that Theresa May has gone to Brussels to concede further text at this stage, before we\u2019ve even left. \u201cThe only way to maintain Gibraltar\u2019s status is for the UK to remain in the EU \u2013 that is why we need a \u2018people\u2019s vote\u2019.\u201d Amid a growing outcry over the government\u2019s concession, the prime minister insisted that nothing had changed over the UK\u2019s territorial claim to Gibraltar. She also dismissed claims from Spain\u2019s foreign minister that the agreement on the Rock had been a victory for Madrid, delivering a treaty that was \u201cthe most important one since the Utrecht Treaty of 1713\u201d, that handed the territory to the British. Theresa May said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s position on the sovereignty of Gibraltar has never changed and will not change. \u201cI\u2019m proud that Gibraltar is British and I will always stand by Gibraltar.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
