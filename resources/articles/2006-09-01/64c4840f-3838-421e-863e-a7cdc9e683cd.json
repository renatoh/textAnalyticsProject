Against a Germany team fresh from an outstanding World Cup, the 37-year-old takes charge of his first competitive match. Thrust from a coaching role at Walsall into the job of national manager, Staunton has been handed the toughest of debut qualifiers. It was in this city that Germany beat Portugal to finish third in the World Cup. Ireland fans arrive with the initial optimism generated under Staunton shattered by a 4-0 hammering at home to Holland just over a fortnight ago. Suggestions that he should go after that result in his third match, which followed a defeat to Chile, were as ludicrous as concluding from his opening 3-0 win over Sweden that he would find the twin challenges of management and qualification a breeze. With key players such as Shay Given, Robbie Keane, Damien Duff and Richard Dunne set to play tonight after missing the Holland game, Staunton is confident of a vastly improved showing. He was very much \"the boss, the gaffer\" against the Dutch because Robson, Ireland's international football consultant, was absent through ill-health. The same applies here, with Robson continuing to recover from brain tumour surgery 10 days ago, and Staunton emphasised the point by saying \"we are all very concerned\" and \"rooting for\" the former Newcastle United manager. This first taste of competitive action excites him. He said: \"You are only allowed to use three subs and of course there's pressure with it but this is what it's all about. I've had the backing of the fans. I understand their frustration at the defeat against Holland but also they're fully aware of the players who weren't there and they know we have a full-strength squad tomorrow night so we will be getting a different performance.\" Positive friendly results under Staunton's predecessor, Brian Kerr, were often not matched in qualifiers so Ireland are entitled to dream that the opposite will be true now. The former Ireland manager Mick McCarthy contacted Staunton after the Holland game to tell him not to be downcast. McCarthy said: \"I also reminded him that when I took over we lost six on the bounce and we still went on to make the play-offs in the next qualification campaign by finishing second in our group. That's as good as almost all of the other teams we've had. We've only ever topped a group once and that was back for Euro 88.\" That tournament provided one of Ireland's finest results, a victory in Germany over England. The goalkeeper, Given, said: \"Just landing in Stuttgart you sense how much history that game made that night and you feel it would be fantastic if we could go and do the same or do something similar.\" A draw would constitute an excellent result. Ireland achieved a point in France two years ago in a World Cup qualifier and could have won. Staunton wants his players to be positive against a Germany who start games as fast under their current coach Joachim L\u00f6w as they did in the World Cup under their then manager J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, judging by a 3-0 win over Sweden last month in which they scored twice in the opening eight minutes. \"The best form of defence is attack - I firmly believe that,\" said Staunton. His attack is expected to include Kevin Doyle, whose father Paddy stands to win \u20ac15,000 (\u00a310,000) two years after placing a \u20ac100 bet at 150-1 on his son playing a competitive game for Ireland. Doyle was then a right-winger at Cork and is now in the Premiership with Reading. Staunton needs to rise spectacularly, too, to the challenges of competitive management to take Ireland to their first tournament since 2002 from a group which also includes the Czech Republic. He added: \"We have always punched above our weight, if you think about it, over the years and I'm sure the players will do the same again and rise to the occasion.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
