And interpreters from Milton to Cecil B DeMille have presented Samson's story as the ultimate triumph of individual strength over adversity. Handel's oratorio (based on Milton's Samson Agonistes) leaves some room for doubt, however, which director Daniel Slater exploits by updating the action to present-day Gaza. In the hands of Slater and designer Daniel Potra, a largely static oratorio assumes the violent immediacy of a news report. The chorus becomes a khaki-clad, stone-throwing mob, while Samson is a broken torture victim flung into the corner of a filthy cell. The brutality of the setting strikes a discord with the sublimity of the music, yet it forces us to consider that Samson - the perpetrator of a suicide mission that results in many innocent deaths - is, by any objective definition, a terrorist. Slater's staging is full of striking images: Samson's visitors are thrust into his presence with sacks over their heads to protect the secrecy of the location. And as the Philistines sing their rather unctuous chorus celebrating Samson's downfall, they settle down to a private screening of Victor Mature's shearing at the hands of Hedy Lamarr. The musical standards are equally arresting: conductor Harry Christophers establishes a fine balance between outward urgency and internal repose; Rebecca de Pont Davies sings with compassion as Micah and Rebecca Bottone with seductiveness as Delila. Jonathan Best is outstanding as Harapha, and Tom Randle's Samson taps into the full potential of what is perhaps Handel's greatest tenor role. \u00b7 Until July 27.
