By a quirk of fate Henman's last match, 24 days ago in the Davis Cup tie in Birmingham, was also against Srichaphan and it triggered the Briton's best performance of the year. But a mental miracle will be needed if he is to produce something similar while awaiting news from London, where his wife Lucy is about to to give birth to their first child. Henman is considering a rapid getaway to be at the bedside in Fulham. If that amounts to a battle against time, the match itself could be billed as the battle of wounded shoulder. While Henman yesterday was performing remedial exercises for his shoulder injury, Srichaphan came into the interview room with an ice-pack under his shirt. The Thai is also suffering from aches and pains around the rotator cuff, perhaps partly because he risked unleashing some of his heaviest serves in a 6-4, 6-4 win over Gustavo Kuerten, the former world No1, who looked jaded after reaching last week's final in Lyon. Only 70 points separate the third man in the Champions Race and the seventh, who will be the last to qualify for the ATP year-end finals in Shanghai. There are 100 points available for the winner here, with two further tournaments to go. Later Fernando Gonzalez, one of the year's fastest risers, came within one beefy blow of doing Henman a favour. The 17th-placed Chilean had a set point against Carlos Moya, who is breathing down the Briton's neck in sixth place in the Race. But the Spaniard survived and won 2-6, 7-6, 7-6."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
