But after yesterday's quarter-finals both Jelena Jankovic and Ana Ivanovic are one match away from Saturday's French Open final, although Jankovic's semi-final opponent Justine Henin, champion for the last two years and three times in all, remains the overwhelming favourite for the title after her 6-4, 6-3 win over Serena Williams. Henin is obviously the outstanding clay-court player of her generation, and any hangover from the controversial 2003 semi-final against Serena - when the younger of the Williams ended up in tears and accused Henin of \"lying and fabricating\" - was not apparent yesterday as the two players clasped each other warmly and in the proper manner of champions at the end of the match. \"Hideous and horrendous\" was how Williams described her own insipid performance, which almost totally lacked fire and contained the minimum of growl. The match itself was sweetness and light. Four years ago everything was so different. Serena had triumphed at the previous four slams when she arrived at Roland Garros, while Henin was pressing for her first major title, something she was to eventually achieve by defeating her fellow Belgian Kim Clijsters in the final. There were thousands of Belgian fans in the crowd on semi-final day, with a great deal of anti-American feeling that also veered towards the racial. Not this time. There was a moment at the beginning of the second set, after Williams dropped her serve and then bounced her racket on the clay, when desultory boos and whistles rang out, while she was also slow-hand-clapped as she changed her racket when about to serve at 4-2 down. However, this was no more than any player might have expected on the Philippe Chatrier court, where the fans are always eager to be a part of the sporting theatre. True, they were always largely on the side of Henin, but so lame was Williams' display that the crowd were rarely involved. \"Nothing worked,\" said the American, who was at a loss to explain her lack of intensity - the very opposite of the extraordinary passion and energy that swept her to the Australian Open title earlier this year. Henin needed to be little more than solid, rather than inspired, although the ease of the win emphasised just how much her forehand has improved in recent years. The backhand has always been the most formidable of weapons. \"I don't think I've every played so badly in the quarter-finals of a slam,\" said Williams. \"I'm always saying I want to peak at the right times, but I didn't have any peaks today. There was no comparison with Australia.\" Understandably Henin, who has separated from her husband this year and missed the Australian Open, believed herself to have done \"a good job\". She had lost to Williams in Miami earlier this year after winning the first set 6-0, and clearly enjoyed her domination this time. After winning the Italian Open title in Rome last month Jankovic, whose only previous slam semi-final was at the US Open last year, said she thought she could win this title if she did not have to play Henin. The two have met five times with the Belgian winning the lot, all of them in three sets. Yesterday Jankovic had a 6-3, 7-5 win over Nicole Vaidisova of the Czech Republic, at 18 years old the youngest of the quarter-finalists, with the Serbian's greater mobility the decisive factor. Her compatriot Ivanovic earned a semi against the world No2 Maria Sharapova, who like her has never previously reached this stage in Paris, by beating another Russian, Svetlana Kuznetsova, 6-0, 3-6, 6-1. Kuznetsova, beaten by Henin in last year's final and winner of the US Open title three years ago, had found herself reduced to blushing smiles when Roger Federer singled her out earlier in the tournament as one of the women players he most liked watching. In the first set against Ivanovic any blushes were instigated by her own ineptitude, although the 19-year-old Serbian hit the ball with wonderful depth and accuracy. Gradually Kuznetsova levered her way back, only to suffer a recurrence of an old abdominal injury which meant she could not serve properly, allowing Ivanovic a clear run to the line. In the other, all- Russian, quarter-final Sharapova beat Anna Chakvetadze 6-3, 6-4. For someone who described her movement on clay as resembling \"a cow on ice\" Sharapova's progress here, bad shoulder and all, has been commendably resolute, although nobody would expect anything less."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
