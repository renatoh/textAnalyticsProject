But, after the biggest product safety scandal in 20 years, even the presence of SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star at this week's Shanghai Toy Expo represents a vote of confidence in an industry that has launched a fierce fightback for its reputation. The cartoon characters joined Mickey Mouse, the Teletubbies and Thomas the Tank Engine in a Toyland turnout at the international trade fair that left little doubt that China remains unchallenged as the workshop of the world. At the first mainland exhibition since Mattel recalled 21m potentially hazardous items, buyers and exhibitors said more children than ever are likely to get Christmas presents produced in Guangdong province in December. China makes 60% of the world's toys, and is an increasingly important market. At the mainland's biggest toy show, its dominance was evident in a record 400-plus exhibitors and more than 3,000 registered buyers. It is a long way from the worst fears in August, when the world's biggest toy firm, Mattel, pulled items including Batman, Barbie, Polly Pocket and Doggie Daycare products from the shelves because some toys contained lead paint or magnets that could be swallowed by children. The recall led to a suicide, a bankruptcy and the tarnishing of the Made in China label. But China's manufacturing juggernaut has powered on. Toy exports rose 18% in the first nine months of this year, Mattel has been forced to apologise for its design faults and multinational toy firms are still lining up to enter the domestic retail market. If there is an impact it will not be felt until next year, when toy prices could rise because of tighter safety checks. \"We are very, very worried about the export market,\" said Stella Ng of the TianQuan toy factory in Guangzhou, which supplies Dream Baby dolls to Toys R Us. \"Our English customers are asking for far more test reports than last year. If there is no test report, then there is no shipment.\" Among the displays was one for British company Hornby, which makes its Scalextric cars in China. Many others were there for the first time, including London-based HiT entertainment, which wants to introduce Thomas the Tank Engine to the local market despite a recall of many of these Chinese-made products from US shelves this summer. English buyers said product safety fears were exaggerated and the blame misplaced. \"I think Mattel caused its own problems by not policing its products properly,\" said Sean Charlesworth of Whitehouse Leisure, an Essex-based company that supplies plush toys to several big British retailers. \"It is all about price. You squeeze a factory too hard and it leads to problems.\" Mr Charlesworth said tighter checks introduced since the scandal mean shipments are being delayed, more goods are being rejected and costs are likely to rise. But in his sector of cuddly toys, he said, there were bigger threats to China's competitiveness. In the past year, the yuan appreciated 7% against the dollar, migrant labour wages rose 17% and tighter environmental controls helped to increase the price of Chinese-made teddy bears by 10-25%. For the first time, he is planning to look at Vietnam and India as an alternative for the millions of cuddly toys he buys each year. Charles Riotto, president of the International Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Association, said the scandal was the biggest since he entered the industry 20 years ago, but the worst is over. \"When we look back at 2007, it will be viewed as a year when manufacturers and licensers really took a look at how safe their products are and how they are perceived by customers. They realise that it is not enough just to have a good product at a good price. It must also be safe and consumers must feel satisfied.\" But, like almost everyone at the fair, he did not expect a change in the pecking order of the toy industry. \"China has a big advantage. It has the workforce and the manufacturing capacity in place. The business is theirs to keep.\" Christmas looks set to be made in China for several years to come."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
