A disciplinary committee found Henson guilty of elbowing the Leicester prop Alex Moreno in the face and breaking his nose during the Ospreys' Heineken Cup defeat in Swansea last Sunday. Henson was playing his second match of the season after recovering from an operation on a groin injury picked up on the Lions tour to New Zealand. His first had been the game between the Ospreys and Leicester at Welford Road the previous week when he appeared to have his head stamped on, but no action was taken by the citing commissioner. Henson was not so fortunate when he elbowed Moreno after 17 minutes last Sunday. The Italy prop appeared to have started the incident when he hit out at Henson; the 23-year old retaliated with an elbow which connected with Moreno's nose and, for good measure, kicked out at him after he fell. Henson appeared before a three-man disciplinary committee in Glasgow yesterday after being cited and pleaded not guilty to both counts. He was found guilty of elbowing, but was acquitted of kicking Moreno. Had the centre pleaded guilty and apologised he would have been banned for six weeks and two days, leaving him available for all of Wales's championship matches in the defence of their Grand Slam except for the opener against England at Twickenham on February 4. The extra four weeks will put him out until the second week of March, when Wales entertain Italy. Given that he has only played three matches this season he is unlikely to feature for Wales at all in the championship and their head coach Mike Ruddock was last night dismayed and surprised at the hefty suspension. \"It is disappointing news for Wales, for the Ospreys and for Gavin himself,\" said Ruddock. \"My first reaction was that it seemed a very long period of time to be out of the game given the circumstances.\" The Ospreys are considering an appeal against either the verdict or the length of suspension, but given the video evidence the best they could hope for would be a reduction of a couple of weeks. A year which started so positively for Henson turned sour on the Lions tour and in the recriminatory pages of his recent book, and has ended on the lowest of notes. The Ospreys will also be without their second-row Ian Evans until February 19. The Wales squad member appeared before the same disciplinary committee yesterday and admitted stamping on the Leicester and England scrum-half Harry Ellis in last Sunday's game. Ellis has had an operation on his cartilage and will be out of action for three to four weeks, leaving him with little hope of facing Wales."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
