Written by Clive Aslet, editor at large of Country Life magazine, the argument went that the British countryside is a far better place than it was when Aslet started travelling around it, first class, in the 1970s. It read like a parody: things are improved because it\u2019s no longer \u201cruinously expensive to heat a country house\u201d, Anglesey is now OK because Waitrose delivers there, and \u2013 \u201churrah!\u201d says Aslet \u2013 you can easily source Baron Bigod brie. If you read the piece carefully, it demonstrated the opposite of Aslet\u2019s argument. In a relatively short article the word \u201clook\u201d appeared nine times. This, it became clear, was the countryside as spectacle, something pleasing to gawp at, photograph and visit. Aslet wasn\u2019t just looking through rose-tinted specs but through a windscreen. The countryside wasn\u2019t somewhere to live full-time but to pass through. The clinching argument that the countryside is healthy was the fact that the bathrooms of some rural B&amp;Bs \u201cwouldn\u2019t look out of place in the Ritz\u201d. Any portrait of rural Britain which is so restless and rootless is bound to miss the reason the countryside is actually under threat: a lack of roots, both metaphorical and literal. It\u2019s easy for urbane city-dwellers to parody us yokels who never leave the village and marry our cousins. But, actually, the strength of any primitive farming community is the fact that it is a settled place. It has to be: because nature takes its time, because land is precious and expensive, and because the returns of farming and forestry are slight and far in the future. That\u2019s why anything agrarian requires continuity, community and intergenerational cooperation. As the great US essayist Wendell Berry wrote in The Art of the Commonplace: \u201cHuman continuity is virtually synonymous with good farming, and good farming obviously must outlast the life of any good farmer.\u201d It\u2019s amazing that, even in the 21st century, we\u2019ve maintained a degree of continuity. Since I haven\u2019t gone far in life, last week I was planting a tree in the village school I attended 35 years ago. Opposite the school was the memorial to the war dead of the village, and it was noticeable that at least a third of the surnames were still present in the village. Families were still living where their grandparents were born. I live near Cheddar Gorge in Somerset, where 19 years ago researchers DNA-tested the remains of a cave-dweller from roughly 7150BC called \u201cCheddar Man\u201d. It turned out that one of the teachers at the local school, a Mr Targett, was a direct descendant. All the troubles of the countryside stem from erosion of that rootedness. Farming communities are inevitably unsettled when land and houses are snapped up by wealthy investors. I\u2019m no defender of the old class system, and I don\u2019t disdain the dreaded \u201cincomers\u201d, but we have to recognise that the organic social fabric has been mercilessly shredded in our lifetime. In my Somerset village the manors and granges used to be owned by resident families who felt a deep sense of noblesse oblige. They were places for f\u00eates and fairs, and their residents offered generous help to the church, school, pub and hall. Now they\u2019re trophy second homes owned by hedge-fund managers, bankers and lawyers who hide behind remote-controlled gates. It\u2019s a story repeated in every village in the country. For Aslet, the fact that the property pages of Country Life are now full of sandstone piles rather than suburban pads clinches his argument that the countryside is now fine and dandy. It\u2019s safe to go there. Whereas for most of us, it\u2019s precisely property porn which is ruining it. There will be a referendum in St Ives next month on a proposal that new-build homes should be available only to the local community \u2013 an attempt to protect the locals from aesthetes and foodies from afar who are attracted by mouth-watering gastropubs, micro-brewers and cool fromagers. The effect of this rootlessness on actual agriculture is even more deleterious. In a mobile and capitalist society, land isn\u2019t treasured as a repository of stories, but simply as an investment to yield returns. In The Need for Roots, Simone Weil wrote that the consequence of this is that with \u201crelations being cut, each thing is looked upon as an end in itself\u201d. So land is a sponge into which you can pour petrochemical fertilisers, and then squeeze out some sterling. It means we no longer belong to the land, but the land to us. That is the reason farms so often appear like motorways: soulless spaces of one lonely farmer in his or her machine. That placelessness allows supermarkets like Tesco and Aldi to sell produce under the banner of fictional farms: they create bucolic-sounding brands \u2013 Woodside Farm or Boswell Farm \u2013 which exist only on the packaging, not on the ground. That disconnect between our land and our plates, the gulf between the source and destination of our food, also creates a culture in which \u2013 forget mutton dressed as lamb \u2013 horsemeat can be passed off as beef. The effects on biodiversity are appalling. The State of Nature report published in 2013 by leading conservation NGOs found that populations of 60% of all UK species have declined in recent decades. Since 1995 the turtle dove has declined by 96%; the willow tit by 82%; and the starling by 53%. The wood warbler, yellow wagtail, grey partridge, lapwing, snipe and corn bunting have all decreased noticeably. Bees continue to suffer colony collapse, their numbers plummeting because of the varroa mite and the use of neonicotinoid pesticides, a ban on which was bafflingly lifted by the government last year. Butterflies and wildflowers are in seemingly inexorable decline. Any agrarian knows that a rural community includes not just humans but all plant and animal life, and we\u2019re bereft because of the disappearance of so many old companions. The call of the cuckoo, once so commonplace, is now a cause of excitement. It\u2019s hard not to be as jaundiced about the future of the countryside as Aslet is perversely Panglossian. Every statistic you can find will point to the troubles afflicting our rural heritage: according to Graham Harvey\u2019s The Killing of the Countryside, 150,000 miles of hedges have been lost in the UK since the introduction of subsidies, and 10,000 miles still disappear every year. In 2008 alone, 400 village shops closed, and between 1997 and 2008 rural schools shut down at a rate of one a month. In 2012 rural pubs closed at a rate of six per week. Bus services continue to be eradicated, libraries closed. Ash trees are dying out because of Chalara dieback. Rural crime is on the increase, with statistics from UK police forces suggesting that, between October 2013 and March 2014, livestock theft increased by 129%. We had 10 piglets stolen a few years ago, and it is surprising how extraordinarily hurtful it is, certainly far worse than 10 favourite bikes being taken. There are some reasons for optimism. Nature is resilient. Farmers\u2019 markets are nobly trying to cut out the corporate go-between. Cottage industries have vastly improved the quality of local foods and drinks. The treatment of mental illness is increasingly holistic and rustic, meaning that \u201ccare farms\u201d (land-based therapeutic communities) are exponentially on the increase. This month, as the bluebells turn our woodland floor lilac, as we plant up the polytunnel and go through the highs and lows of lambing, it can truly seem like a bucolic way to live. We just don\u2019t want someone passing through in his car, telling us how lucky we are. Tobias Jones is a Somerset backwoodsman.
