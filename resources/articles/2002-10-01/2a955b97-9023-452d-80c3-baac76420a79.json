For the first time in many years the Manchester United defender faces serious competition for his England spot. Until he sustained the foot injury that thrust Mills into action in Japan his place seemed as secure as David Beckham's. The 27-year-old loses form as often as Arsenal lose a match and his 52 caps have been won as an almost immovable fixture. Yet when he said yesterday that England could be \"genuine contenders\" over the next four years, it was with no guarantee that he would begin this latest phase in the side. Neville's determination to regain his place was evident as he chatted. But his hopes of playing in Slovakia are in the balance, and not just because he has started only twice for United since recovering from his metatarsal problem. Mills had an impressive World Cup after his error against Sweden, providing England's best attacking impetus in the second half against Brazil. If Mills went to the Far East a relative novice and with doubts surrounding his temperament, he came back an established, trusted international. Though stressing his admiration for Neville this week, he said: \"I believe I've done enough to hold down my place. I don't pick the team but if I did I'd play myself.\" Sven-Goran Eriksson has given away nothing, though Neville is favourite. In part that is because a defence comprising Mills, Ugo Ehiogu, Gareth Southgate and Ashley Cole would contain only one player with more than 15 caps. It is also because of Neville's understanding with Beckham. Their partnership at Old Trafford brings a defensive and attacking bond. Yet Neville, who stressed he was fit enough to play both in Bratislava and at home to Macedonia despite a lack of match practice, knows being a good friend and clubmate of the captain is no guarantee. \"That would never be a reason for me to be selected by a manager of Alex Ferguson or Sven-Goran Eriksson's experience,\" he said. He seemed upset by the idea that he and Beckham need each other to perform to their best. \"I've heard it said quite a lot over the years that I play well with David Beckham,\" he said. \"That's just a case of the fact we've played so many times together. We wouldn't be playing for United individually unless the manager thought we were good enough. I don't think it's a case of me getting the best out of David Beckham or David Beckham getting the best out of me.\" Neville sees in Beckham one of a core of players with the quality to win England either Euro 2004 or, less likely, the World Cup in 2006. \"People say you always need four or five world-class players to win a tournament and I believe in this squad there are four or five genuine world-class players,\" he said. \"I don't think there are teams in Europe than can boast centre-halves like [Rio] Ferdinand and [Sol] Campbell. \"Then there are [Michael] Owen, [Paul] Scholes, Beckham, [Steven] Gerrard. These are players any team in Europe would love to have in their team. I honestly believe if these players can stay fit for England, along with the good young players around them, we have a great chance.\" Campbell and Ferdinand's absence from the trip to Slovakia is not a promising start on the injury front, but Neville's confidence is based on the way he has seen United grow. The World Cup defeat by Brazil, which he blames on the heat, does not worry him. \"People said we didn't have the belief to beat Brazil,\" he said. \"I'm not too concerned if we didn't, to be honest, because this is a really young team. I remember when I first came into the Manchester United team in the Champions League, I think it took us two or three years before we really realised we could beat Juventus, who were the best team in Europe at the time. \"Eventually we were to the stage where we grew up as a team. This team will grow up and it will get to the stage where you play [Brazil] again and you have the belief to go on and beat them. It's a case of bridging that gap all the time. From where we were 18 months ago there have been great strides.\" Neville admitted he would feel unfulfilled, despite all his club success, if he never won anything with his country. The first thing he needs to win with England, of course, is his place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
