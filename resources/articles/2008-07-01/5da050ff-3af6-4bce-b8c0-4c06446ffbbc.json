She plays Bakhtay, a determined little madam who stomps off in search of this school business she's been hearing about. Scripted by Makhmalbaf's mother, Marzieh Meshkini, there are some playful snapshots of a child's fancies and half-grasped ideas of the world. The mood darkens when she runs into a pack of older boys playing at Taliban, who rip up the notebook she has spent all morning bartering eggs to buy. Their act of mindless cultural vandalism is a miniature of the Taliban's destruction of the two giant stone Buddhas in the Bamyan cliffs, where the film is set. What kind of men will these brutalised boys make, Makhmalbaf is asking - but her film builds up an overwrought symbolism that fails to hit the mark dramatically. Still these are big issues to be taken on by a young director whose clear-cut sense of injustice make this an ideal film for older kids."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
