They turned out to be payments to a short-term loans company called Lending Stream, yet I have never applied for or received such a loan. I asked Lending Stream for a copy of the contract I supposedly signed but to no avail. Lloyds, concluding my details had been fraudulently used, refunded me, but then decided I had taken out the loan, even though it could provide no evidence of the money reaching my account and the manager of my local Lloyds branch supported my case. It therefore repaid the money to Lending Stream. How can we trust our financial institutions when they are able to give my money away to all and sundry? NW Bristol Lending Stream promises short-term loans at eye-watering rates in as little as 10 minutes \u2013 which may explain how easy it is for fraudulent claims to be waved through, although the company insists its security checks are scrupulous and reckons someone hacked into your bank account to provide all the necessary details. Amazingly, it says it was unable to respond to your requests to see the contract you were supposed to have signed \"due to compliance with the Data Protection Act\". The company now says it should have referred you to the police for a crime reference number and has now refunded you \u00a3500 and terminated the contract. As for Lloyds, which ignored the views of its own manager and left you to fend for yourself, is it ashamed of its desultory security measures? Not a bit. \"As Lending Stream produced documents showing [the account holder's] name and address with an electronic signature, it became harder to ascertain this was fraud at the time that the evidence was presented,\" says a spokesperson, who then apologises for the \"inconvenience\". You might want to consider closing your Lloyds account since it's still unclear how your bank details were obtained and what is being done to prevent it happening again.
