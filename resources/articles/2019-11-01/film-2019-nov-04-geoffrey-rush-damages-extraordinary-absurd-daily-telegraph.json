On Monday the Daily Telegraph through its parent company, Nationwide News, began its appeal against federal court justice Michael Wigney\u2019s ruling that the Rupert Murdoch-owned newspaper had defamed Rush by alleging he \u201cengaged in inappropriate behaviour\u201d during a Sydney Theatre Company production of King Lear in 2015. Rush is due to receive $2.9m, including $1.97m in special damages based on past and future lost earnings \u2013 the largest defamation payout to a single person in Australia. The Daily Telegraph is appealing against the decision, and as late as Monday morning had planned to argue that Wigney\u2019s conduct in the case \u201cgave rise to an apprehension of bias\u201d, citing examples of the \u201ctone\u201d used by the judge throughout the trial and his assessment of the credibility of the newspaper\u2019s witnesses. But on Monday afternoon the Daily Telegraph\u2019s barrister, Tom Blackburn SC, told the court the newspaper would no longer press the claim. Blackburn said he saw \u201cno utility in the circumstances\u201d in pressing the apprehended bias claim because the Daily Telegraph was seeking a retrial on other grounds. The Daily Telegraph is also arguing the judge erred both in finding that the Daily Telegraph\u2019s star witness, Eryn Jean Norvill, gave unreliable evidence and in awarding special damages to Rush based on an \u201cinference\u201d the actor would no longer be able to work. It has argued for a retrial if the first challenge is upheld, and Blackburn said if they succeeded \u201cin those circumstances we see no need to press [the apprehended bias] claim\u201d. Rush\u2019s barrister, Bret Walker SC, slammed the sudden change of heart, saying the Daily Telegraph\u2019s \u201cvery grave\u201d allegation of bias had been \u201ca slur both on the trial judge and on the cogency of the vindication our client has enjoyed\u201d. Lawyers for the Daily Telegraph have called the decision to award Geoffrey Rush $2.9m in damages after a series of defamatory articles about the Oscar-winning actor \u201cextraordinary and absurd\u201d, and based on \u201cuncertain inferences from inexact proofs\u201d. At the opening of the two-day appeal before three judges in the federal court in Sydney on Monday, Blackburn argued the court should overturn Wigney\u2019s finding that the newspaper\u2019s key witness, the actor Eryn-Jean Norvill, was \u201cprone to exaggeration and embellishment\u201d. During the trial Norvill, who made the initial complaint about the actor to the STC, told the court that Rush \u2013 one of Australia\u2019s best-known actors \u2013 engaged \u201cdaily\u201d in a pattern of \u201csexual harassment\u201d including \u201csexual innuendo\u201d and groping gestures that made her feel \u201cbelittled\u201d, \u201cfrightened\u201d and \u201ctrapped\u201d. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But Wigney found Norvill\u2019s evidence was \u201cnot only uncorroborated but contradicted\u201d by other witnesses. He said in his judgment he \u201cwas not ultimately persuaded that Ms Norvill was an entirely credible witness\u201d. On Monday, Blackburn argued Wigney\u2019s findings about Norvill were \u201cglaringly improbable\u201d. He raised five examples of Wigney\u2019s judgment about Norvill, including his finding that the actor did not need to make \u201chighly complimentary\u201d comments about Rush during an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald to promote the play in 2015. \u201cThese were press conferences in support of the Sydney Theatre Company\u2019s production of King Lear, this is not mainstream entertainment, this is not a Harry Potter movie,\u201d Blackburn said. \u201cIt is, if not niche entertainment, it\u2019s certainly not mainstream entertainment. \u201cWhat is Ms Norvill supposed to do? Is she supposed to be guarded, or heroically pure at a press conference? Mr Rush was obviously, apart from being a distinguished actor, obviously a great drawcard for this production, I mean she had to talk him up.\u201d Blackburn told the court the decision to award special damages in favour of Rush was \u201cextraordinary and absurd\u201d because while the actor had \u201cdelivered his lines\u201d over three days in the witness box, he had never told the court he had not received offers to work. \u201cHere\u2019s one thing he didn\u2019t say, that is, \u2018I am unable to work because of these articles.\u2019 He just didn\u2019t say it,\u201d Blackburn said. \u201cNeither did he say I have received no or fewer offers because of these articles. His American agent, Fred Specktor, did not say he has received no or fewer offers because of these articles, his Australian agent wasn\u2019t called, no one gave that evidence.\u201d Blackburn said the \u201cfailure\u201d to ask Rush that question was \u201cnot explicable on any other conceivable basis other than that it was a deliberate decision\u201d. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t clearly come out and say \u2018I have received no offers of work,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe say it is very strange for the court to be having to draw inferences about his state of mind. On ordinary principles the court should have inferred that it wasn\u2019t asked [because] counsel feared to ask it. The fear being the answer might be unfavourable.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
