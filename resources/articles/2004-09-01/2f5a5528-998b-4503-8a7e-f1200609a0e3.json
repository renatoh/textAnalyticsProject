Sheikh Sadeik, the imam of Toxteth's Al-Rahma mosque, the city's largest, led the congregation in a prayer for Mr Bigley and his family. \"Islam completely forbids any innocent individual should be targeted, bombed, harmed, oppressed, taken captive, tortured or killed,\" he said in Arabic. \"We must all pray together for the best possible outcome for the fate of Mr Bigley, his family and not forget the innocent Iraqis who are losing their lives daily in this terrible and destructive situation.\" After a week in which the population of Liverpool has watched the Bigley family go through extremes of emotions, Muslims were queueing up to express their opinions about the kidnapping. Criticism of the kidnapping was unanimous and unequivocal, but among a minority there was some sympathy with the cause. Dr Ayoub Bazzaz, an Iraqi who works as an anatomist at Liverpool University, studied for four years in Baghdad with Dr Rihab Taha, one of the two female Iraqi prisoners whose release from American custody is being demanded by the terrorists holding Mr Bigley. Describing her as a colleague and a friend, he said she and the other female prisoner, Huda Ammash, should be released. \"I do condemn the kidnapping, it's terrorism but I would support the release of Rihab just to save the life of Mr Bigley. \"She is a scientist, a professional. And our culture says that women should not be detained in prison, it is shameful for them and their family.\" While condemning the militant group who seized Mr Bigley, he also criticised Tony Blair and George Bush for failing to understand that Iraqis would not live under occupation. \"If they understood that Iraqi culture does not let any occupiers stay in our country, then things like this (hostage taking) would not happen. \"Saddam Hussein has been toppled. Fine. Now the forces should go, we can say thank you, we can give you whatever you want, petrol, money, pay you back, but just go now.\" Many in the congregation feared a backlash against the small Muslim community of 15,000 in Liverpool as a result of the acts being carried out in the name of Islam by the militant group. Bora Balci, 31, a Turkish lawyer, said: \"What they [the terrorists] are doing is totally unacceptable, inhuman and un-Islamic. One of the fundamental beliefs of Islam is that Muslims should not harm even an ant, let alone hurt a human in the cause of Islam. \"The Islamic faith should not be blamed, there are good and bad people in every community. But I fear there is a danger of Islamophobia because of all the acts around the world being carried out in the name of Islam.\" Mr Balci said he had attended two services in St Mary's church, Walton - a stone's throw from the Bigley family home - to pray for the British hostage and his family. His attendance was a mark of how successful religious leaders in Liverpool have been in the last eight days in forging links between all faiths to quell anti-Islamic feelings in the city. Catholic priests have read the Qur'an at Sunday church services and Muslim leaders have attended Christian vigils. Abdul Hakeem, 25, said: \"Everyone with faith is appalled by this evil. There is absolutely no way it can be condoned. Terrible things are happening in Iraq and people get desperate but evil does not combat evil, it just causes more mayhem. I just pray that Mr Bigley will be released.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
