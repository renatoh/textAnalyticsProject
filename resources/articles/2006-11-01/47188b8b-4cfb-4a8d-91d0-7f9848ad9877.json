Oh, I know all the publicity this week centred around the programme's debut on Radio 2 over Christmas - after all, the incongruity of His Bobness sharing a network with Wogan is too good a story to miss. But once the festivities are over and 2007 is upon us, Bob's regular radio home in the UK will be the BBC's 6 Music, every Friday night. Why the excitement? Well, because this new weekly radio show hosted by Bob Dylan appears to transcend anything one might feel about the man himself, or even his music. As an exasperated Alexis Petrides recently pointed out, the world divides into people who regard Dylan as a genius beyond criticism, and those who wonder what the fuss is about. But a quick glance through the playlists on the Theme Time Radio Hour web page makes it apparent that none of our preconceptions matter. However we feel about him as a singer - and whatever he turns out to be like as a presenter - his musical knowledge is clearly vast and wide-ranging. Each weekly one-hour show is devoted to a specific theme - and the list alone makes a kind of bizarre folk poetry: baseball, bible, cars, coffee, coffee, dance, devil, divorce, dog, drinking, eyes, father, flower, food, friends &amp; neighbours, gun, halloween, jail, map, mother, radio, Rich Man Poor Man, school, sleep, summer, telephone, time, water, weather, wedding ... And Dylan's selections hop blithely across genres and generations - from Bing Crosby to Blur, Cab Calloway to Carole King, Loretta Lynn to Lulu. In an age when music gets hemmed in by ever-narrower categorisations, it's refreshing to hear of a radio show where Charles Mingus rubs shoulders with the Detroit Cobras, Randy Newman with Django Reinhart. By a simple twist of fate the person who offered Bob carte blanche to play such wildly diverse music on his show is none other than Lee Abrams, chief programming officer at satellite station XM Radio. Yes, that same consultant whose company Burkhart/Abrams helped create the stultifying AOR stranglehold on American FM radio in the 1970s and 80s - and who pioneered the tyranny of branding and demographics that makes so many radio stations sound the way they do today. Still, there's none so righteous as the repented sinner - and Abrams has written an awestruck and enthusiastic blog about his efforts to reach Dylan and persuade him to make truly eclectic old-time radio shows. Interestingly, the UK syndication of Theme Time Radio Hour may have unintended benefits for listeners in America, where the programme is only available online via the (Windows only) Napster subscription service. Come January, they'll be able to stream the show live every Friday from the 6 Music website free of charge, on top of Radio 2's season of specials during the holiday period. All things considered, not a bad Christmas present from the Old Country."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
