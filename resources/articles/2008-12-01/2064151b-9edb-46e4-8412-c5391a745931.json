The series shows Saddam Hussein as a naive diplomat trying to defend his country from the aggression of others, a leader who misread signs and pursued wars which he lost but then declared he won. It shows him as a tough politician capable of murdering his best friend with his own hand to demonstrate his desire for power. It managed to portray him as a man whose only demand was complete loyalty and whose only concern was for his family and his country (though it also showed him as an unfaithful husband living a life of material luxury while his people suffered from sanctions). In sum, the film presented Saddam as a cross between a beleaguered CEO trying to keep his ship of state afloat in a stormy world, and a figure like Michael Corleone, who was just taking care of business. But while that isn't a sympathetic portrayal, it nonetheless whitewashes Saddam and his regime, adding to the anti-war mythology that the Iraqis were in some sense better off before the US invasion. The film insults the millions of Iraqis who died as a result of Saddam's genocidal projects, sustained suppression of political opponents and the bloody wars he instigated. Here are just a few examples of the movie's attempt to humanise Saddam's personality and minimise his crimes. The mini-series begins in 1979 \u2013 a third of the way through Saddam's career \u2013 and implies that Saddam seised absolute power that year because he properly understood the threat of rising fundamentalism in neighbouring Iran. Therefore, the mini-series does not offer viewers the context of Saddam's earlier rise through the ranks of the Baathist party, a rise distinguished by his violence and sadism. More important, the movie does not explain that the Iranian revolution represented a threat because it might have inspired Iraq's Shia to overthrow their shackles. The movie offers no serious description of the ethnic politics of Iraq. It does not make clear that Saddam governed as the leader of a minority ethnic group that consciously and aggressively repressed the majority. This failure to establish the ethnic-sectarian foundation of Iraq's Baathist regime means that each of the main dimensions of Saddam's genocidal projects is ignored. The Iran-Iraq war is not shown for what it was: an ethnic conflict in which Saddam forced Shia to fight Shia. In the aftermath of that war, Saddam ordered the Anfal campaign to destroy the Kurdish nation in northern Iraq, but this is mentioned in the series only in an opaque passing remark over lunch. The withdrawal of the Republican Guard from Kuwait in 1991 is presented as an attempt to defend Baghdad from foreign troops and does not mention that they were in fact used to mass-murder Iraqi Shia who rose up against Saddam's abuses. Most perversely, the series repeatedly portrays Saddam asking how the people feel toward his regime, when we know from the regime's internal documents that the Saddamite leadership perceived entire categories of men, women and children \u2013 Kurds, Shias and even many Sunnis \u2013 as internal enemies who were best addressed through terror and not good governance. In sum, Saddam's regime is presented as being run by gangsters who kill disloyal individuals. But bad as that is, it constitutes a whitewash of a fully genocidal regime that proceeded on the basis of sustained assaults on and destruction of entire ethnic groups, including large swathes of Iraq's Kurdish, Marsh Arab and Shia communities. If you took this series as a text on international history, you would walk away thinking that Saddam based his foreign policy on defending his country. The series first mentions Iran when the Ayatollah Khomeini threatens Iraq. Baghdad then suffers unexplained bombings by a group loyal to Khomeini. The clear impression is that Iraq is threatened by this low-intensity attack. Only then do we see Iraq attack Iran. When Iraq loses that war, Saddam declared a victory and went after Kuwait after ruining his own country. Again, the first mention of Kuwait is the country forcing down the price of oil and thereby thwarting Saddam's attempt to rebuild his country. Saddam promises to feed his people in one subsequent scene, as though his motivation for the attack on Kuwait was in some sense humanitarian. The reality is that within 10 years, Saddam invaded two neighbouring countries in unvarnished wars of aggression. These inconvenient truths of Saddam's regime did not fit the picture that this series tried to paint. It even presents the secret police as beginning its mass murdering rampage only after there is an attempt on Saddam's life rather than as a consistent feature of the regime which only intensified over time. And the presentation of the torturing of victims invites direct comparisons between actions by Saddam's thugs and those of US troops during the final search for a fugitive Saddam. In fact, the first and only mention of Abu Ghraib is as an American detention centre, not as a prison in which Saddam tortured and murdered thousands. There is much more that could be said. But to summarise, HBO and the BBC wanted its audience to see Saddam as a family man, a tyrant at home and a dictator at work who became this way because his stepfather beat him. In this version of revisionist history, Saddamn was an ordinary dictator who presided over an ordinary kind of authoritarian regime that ran as a family business. But it was not. Saddam was uniquely brutal in his rise through the Baathist party. His regime sought to eliminate entire groups from the nation, and he launched two aggressive wars against neighbouring states. Saddam was a genocidal dictator who terrorised his own people. This cinematic attempt to normalise him is a disgrace.
