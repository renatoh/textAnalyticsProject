Until then she was known for staging shocking extremes of sex and cruelty, but this drama, written under a pseudonym, was too poetic to be dismissed as the \u201cdisgusting feast of filth\u201d that her debut had been three years earlier. More than two decades on, it has lost none of its lyricism and dramatic intensity. Kane left almost no stage directions to denote gender, time or place, and because of this deliberate vagueness, the play becomes fertile ground for invention. Tinuke Craig\u2019s direction gives it a noirish tautness. The stage is uncluttered and abstract with little to distract us from its four characters, who spend the play tussling between nihilistic despair and cravings for love. But there is no ponderousness to the anguish and the speed of their delivery builds a magnetic, edge-of-the-seat tension. Their voices initially rise out of darkness. The lights are switched on and we see them each on their own strip of conveyor belt. They look and sound Beckettian, forever propelled forward on the treadmills but going nowhere. The characters speak their lines in rhythm, as if a modern-day Greek chorus, but they also appear to be stranded in their own psychic quarantine and pouring words into the void. They have just single letters for names \u2013 A, B, C and M \u2013 but each actor quickly makes themselves solid and distinct. Erin Doherty as C gives a scintillating performance, speaking of childhood abuse, doubling up in anguish and spitting out words in rage. Jonathan Slinger as A is just as sensational, declaring himself a paedophile, and telling mournful, poetic stories. Alfred Enoch as B, and Wendy Kweh as M, are strong presences as well, if slightly eclipsed by the force of the other two. The script contains a quick, kinetic energy and Alex Lowde\u2019s stage design reflects its motion. The stage constantly revolves, and cameras at the end of each treadmill project images of the actors on to a back-screen, which at first feels an unnecessary distraction, but the overall effect is cumulatively dramatic, mirroring the lurching inner states of its four characters. Joshua Pharo\u2019s lighting is filled with shadows and silhouettes to create a brooding intensity and there are switches between light and dark as the characters try to find a way out of their despair. The script echoes everything from the Bible (\u201cGlory be to the father\u201d) to TS Eliot\u2019s The Waste Land (\u201cHurry up please it\u2019s time\u201d) and Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet (\u201cTo die, to sleep\u201d). But there is plainer language, too: \u201cI am so fucking lonely,\u201d says one, against a soundscape of discordant violins. \u201cI feel nothing,\u201d says another. But then, out of the blue, someone says \u201cI dream about you\u201d, while another speaks of \u201ca pale gold sea under a pale pink sky\u201d and these suddenly hopeful moments seem like a match struck in the dark. \u2022 Performances streamed live until 7 November."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
