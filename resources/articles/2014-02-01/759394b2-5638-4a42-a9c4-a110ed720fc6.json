The two fashion moments of the night belonged to Lupita Nyong'o, a best supporting actress nominee for her role in 12 Years a Slave, who wore the standout frock \u2013 a statuesque Christian Dior in bold jade green \u2013 and power couple Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, who wore his-and-hers tuxedos to support the film, which Pitt produced. Red-carpet fashion is a world caught in aspic, where little changes from decade to decade. The pale satin dress in which Jennifer Lawrence collected a best actress Oscar in 2013 is not so different from the one in which Grace Kelly collected hers in 1955. So Angelina's choice of outfit \u2013 a custom-made Saint Laurent tuxedo \u2013 was a bold move which will reinforce her reputation as one of Hollywood's risk-takers. The matching tuxedos were an interesting choice, also, in underscoring the Brangelina brand as being about them as a couple. These tuxedos \u2013 his by Valentino, hers by Saint Laurent \u2013 will knit the pair even closer together in the public imagination. Meanwhile, Nyong'o's choice of dress signified a move from promising newcomer to bona fide star. No offbeat choice by an emerging designer for Nyong'o: rather, a strapless Dior gown, the gold standard of movie-star attire. With the Baftas being held in the middle of London Fashion Week, the British fashion industry were looking for a strong showing on the red carpet. Jolie was not the only leading lady in trousers, with Ruth Wilson wearing a silver suit by Antonio Berardi. Amy Adams wore Victoria Beckham, while Cate Blanchett wore Alexander McQueen \u2013 both floor-length and black \u2013 while Lily Allen chose a vivacious Vivienne Westwood gown and Sally Hawkins a graceful silver dress custom-made by Mulberry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
