Ansari has denied all wrongdoing, but sitting in the imposing Palais Theatre, I hoped that he would lead the way for other men who had been confronted by the cultural shift that the #MeToo movement demanded. I wanted him to talk about the difficulty of navigating sexual situations; to illuminate the scenarios and often insidious behaviour that can hurt women, as he has so deftly done in his previous standup sets, his 2015 book Modern Romance and his brilliant Netflix series Master of None. I\u2019m not the only one who has been anticipating this response. The allegation against Ansari \u2013 that he pressured a woman for sex during a date despite her verbal and non-verbal cues that she was uncomfortable \u2013 positioned him in the murky space between \u201cgood guy\u201d and \u201cbad guy\u201d. It forced many of us to look at our friends, partners, brothers, fathers and selves, and reassess our expectations, standards and beliefs. Like Kristen Roupenian\u2019s hugely popular short story Cat Person, it added much-needed nuance to a movement that was driven by extremes. Ansari came to represent the everyman in a way that other high-profile #MeToo accused couldn\u2019t and I wanted him to offer a way forward. Mere minutes into Monday night\u2019s set, Ansari dove in. He talked about the aftermath of the allegation with sincerity and humility, explaining again that it made him \u201ca better person\u201d. But disappointingly, he stopped short of addressing any of the alleged behaviour, expressing regret only at how the woman felt. I was torn, simultaneously moved by his vulnerability as he shared a deeply personal, difficult experience with over 2,000 strangers, and disheartened by his refusal to talk about the complexities of the situation that led to it. Though he soon moved on from the topic, my unease lingered as he launched into bit after bit that seemed to almost aggressively mount a case in his defence. When Ansari joked about the excess wokeness that has flooded western society, his hurt at being on the wrong end of it threatened to overshadow the humour. When he insisted that we can\u2019t keep looking at past events and texts \u201cthrough 2019 eyes\u201d, it played like a rebuttal to his detractors \u2013 one that the current climate didn\u2019t afford him during the immediate fallout. At times the connection to his accusation was more explicit. Running through the set was the contention that we are all shitty people who are constantly growing, and he repeatedly used himself as an example. He cited a 2010 episode of beloved sitcom Parks and Recreation that saw his character, Tom, gift a woman a spycam teddy bear. If he was given the script today, he asserted, he would immediately reject it; back then, he (and we) thought it was funny. He described feeling dread when the documentary series Surviving R Kelly created renewed outrage upon its release earlier this year: nine years ago Ansari enthusiastically praised the disgraced R\u2019n\u2019B star in his first standup special (\u201cI\u2019ve had a shaky year as it is,\u201d he joked when hypothesising about someone digging up the footage). The audience was also implicated, as Ansari challenged us to imagine having our previous R Kelly advocacy on camera. A second challenge was implied: Imagine having a sexual misconduct allegation made very publicly against you. Though the defensiveness with which Ansari built his case continued to unnerve me, any temptation to judge him was equally uncomfortable. I couldn\u2019t begrudge his frustration and I agreed with many of his points. He\u2019s not wrong to question the sincerity of white people\u2019s sudden wokeness (\u201cThings just don\u2019t become racist when white people figure it out\u201d), particularly considering his lived experiences as a racial minority. His assertion that the past can\u2019t always be judged by today\u2019s standards is merely sensible; such rejection of retroactive \u201ccancel culture\u201d is justifiably gaining momentum with the recognition that society\u2019s morals are in constant flux. Further complicating my position was the warmth I felt towards him. Ansari is sharp, insightful and incredibly funny. More crucially, he is eminently likeable, due in large part to his relatability. Ansari has a profound ability to mine the idiosyncrasies of modern life in a way that makes him seem like he is one of your friends. He has also mastered the art of delivering wake-up calls with a spoonful of sugar: after ridiculing white wokeness, for example, he offered earnest gratitude for the progress it has ushered. While being likeable doesn\u2019t immediately discount a person\u2019s faults, it is significant here because for Ansari, it comes from a place of unfettered honesty. If there was a triumph on Monday night, this was it. Ansari didn\u2019t \u201cperfectly\u201d address the allegation, nor did he succumb to the anger or bitterness he might have felt after being burnt. Instead, he was deeply, imperfectly human, complete with all its attendant messiness. The thoughtful (dare I say woke) reflections on gender inequality that have populated his previous work may have waned, but in their place is an admirable vulnerability that exposes as many flaws as it does virtues. Like the allegation against him, Ansari resists easy categorisation, oscillating between good and bad, grateful and angry, offended and offender. With Road to Nowhere, he invites his audience to do the same. It was an uncomfortable space to sit in at times, but it was undeniably real. \u2022 Aziz Ansari\u2019s Road to Nowhere tour continues through New Zealand, Paris and Ireland in June"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
