Over more than 30 years in west Africa, Tony Rinaudo has regenerated more than 6m hectares \u2013 an area nearly as large as Tasmania. His farmer-managed natural regeneration technique is responsible for 240m trees regrowing across that parched continent. But it very nearly never happened. Having grown up in Myrtleford, in country Victoria, Rinaudo moved to Niger, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, in 1981, inspired by his Christian faith and a desire \u201csomewhere, somehow to make a difference\u201d. But after two years of intense tree-planting and trying to coax some life from the arid landscape regularly devastated by severe drought, he despaired. \u201cI was in charge of a reforestation project that was failing miserably, it wasn\u2019t that I was particularly dumb, it was the same story all over west Africa. And I remember the frustration that just hit me: north, south, east, west, was a barren landscape, and I knew perfectly well that 80 or 90% of the trees I was carrying [in my car] for planting would die.\u201d But this day, crouching in the sand to reduce his tyres\u2019 air pressure, he looked more closely at the few low desert bushes scattered around the landscape, the only thing that would grow there. Rinaudo knew they were not small bushes, but trees that had been hacked down. Looking more closely, he realised that, if pruned and allowed to grow, they stood a chance of flourishing. \u201cIn that moment, everything changed. We didn\u2019t need to plant trees, it wasn\u2019t a question of having a multi-million dollar budget and years to do it, everything you needed was in the ground.\u201d The root system of the chopped down trees remained alive under the ground \u2013 Rinaudo describes it as an \u201cunderground forest\u201d \u2013 it just needed to be pruned and allowed to grow. \u201cNature would heal itself, you just needed to stop hammering it.\u201d Thirty years on, his technique \u2013 he describes it as akin to pruning a grape vine back to just one or two stems each season \u2013 has a name, farmer-managed natural regeneration (FMNR). It is, Rinaudo says, an \u201cembarrassingly simple solution\u201d to what appeared to be an intractable problem. But it involved overturning generations of accepted wisdom, and a resistance to giving some land back to nature. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got people who are on the edge of starvation every year, not just in famine years, you\u2019ve got this perception that you need every square inch of farmland to grow food crops. And here\u2019s this nut telling people they should sacrifice some of their land for trees.\u201d Rinaudo \u2013 known then as \u201cthe crazy white farmer\u201d \u2013 managed to convince 10 farmers in as many villages to back his plan, to allow trees to regrow across the land they\u2019d been intensively farming for decades. A drought was the catalyst for a work-for-food program, which brought reluctant farmers into the fold, but when the farming yields were, at first, no worse, then better, then dramatically so, the new technique took off. Thirty years on, 6m hectares of land have been regenerated under FMNR, totalling 240m trees. The reforestation of the landscape can be seen on satellite images from space. At the UN\u2019s global climate talks in Katowice, Poland, this week \u2013 as thousands of delegates from all over the world debated the minutiae of a complex worldwide rulebook for climate change \u2013 Rinaudo quietly took his farming message from meeting room to meeting room, delegation to delegation. The trees, Rinaudo says, improve farming yields, reduce ground temperatures and hold water in the soil. They provide firewood and make farming, in places where the temperature regularly reaches 40C, more comfortable. But the trees also act, Rinaudo says, as a powerful carbon sink, and with the potential to draw in billions more tonnes of carbon. For his work on regeneration, Rinaudo was recognised this year in the Right Livelihood Awards, often described as the alternative Nobel, and focused on fields such as environmental protection, human rights, sustainability and peace. Working with World Vision, Rinaudo has taken his technique across the world, from arid Somaliland to tropical East Timor. There are 2bn hectares of degraded land in the world, he argues, and much of that land can be restored to help pull carbon from the atmosphere. Regeneration is not the silver bullet for climate change \u2013 no such thing exists \u2013 but it could be a powerful tool to assist. \u201cWe can do this very cheaply, we can do this very quickly, and we can do this at scale.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
