His famous sentence 'Comment is free, but facts are sacred' has stood the test of time as the ultimate statement of values for a free press, and it continues to underpin the traditions of the Guardian today. Those traditions and values are at the heart of everything we do, from our award-winning global journalism and our engagement with employees through to our supply chain, our contribution to the society in which we live, and the companies with whom we work and do business. In keeping with last year, we will be focusing our efforts on four key areas: people and community, open and independent, climate responsibility and good business. I'm proud to lead a company that believes that these areas and our commitment to them are more important now than ever. Andrew Miller CEO, Guardian Media Group"}, "isHosted": false}}}
