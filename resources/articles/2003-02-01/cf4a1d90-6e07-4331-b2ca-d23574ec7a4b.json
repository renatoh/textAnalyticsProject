The poor flu-ravaged, snot-soaked, mucus-covered, shiveringly teeth-chattering, aching, sweating, oh-God-I'm-miserable-and-I-want-to-die so please-postpone-the-match dears only have 10 full internationals on the field. How ever will they cope? 2 mins: Keane finds Neville on the left with a quickly taken free. He crosses for Van Nistelrooy but Ferrara puts it out for a corner. Nowt comes of it. 3 mins: GOAL Manchester United 1 - 0 Juventus Montero concedes another corner. Beckham crosses it into the box quickly and Wes Brown heads it home. 4 mins: Wes Brown's first goal in 111 matches for United was impressive, but mighty soft. Chimenti, Juve's reserve goalkeeper, should have kept it out, but flapped haplessly as the ball went past him. Credit must go to Beckham for having the quick wit (no, really) to take the corner while Montero the centre-back was out of position. 6 mins: Butt gives the ball to Zalayeta, but wins it back on the edge of the box when the late replacement for Juve's captain Conte (injured in the warm-up) tries to pick out Trezeguet. 8 mins: \"Rather than thrill us all with the 'big match', our local sports network is showing ladies curling,\" writes John Dale. \"It's up to you to keep us Toronto fans informed!\" Don't knock ladies curling until you've tried it, John. I've known some lovely hairdressers in my time. Sorry. 10 mins: Zalayeta wins a corner off Beckham. That has to be worth an airborne boot in the chops at half-time. Wes Brown clears. 11 mins: Giggs wins a throw-in. Expect Manchester United fans to start raving about a \"return to form\" any second now. 12 mins: Giggs tries and fails to dribble past Tacchinardi on the edge of the Juve box. 13 mins: Despite the setback that saw their heads drop early doors, Juve's players seem to be their stride. Manchester United attack and Silvestre picks out Beckham on the edge of the box. His shot is charged down by Montero. 14 mins: \"With your World Cup reportage last year you acquired a couple of Yank fans this side of the water,\" writes Geoffrey K. James. \"We're against the war by the way, though given that the country is run by what in Britain would be called the Bugger Off Party, not sure how much good our opposition will do.\" Don't be so modest Geoffrey. I'm sure if you'd CCed your mail to George W Bush he'd have a major rethink about bombing the bejayzus out of Iraq in the near future. The fact that he wasn't actually elected by the majority of you Americans doesn't necessarily mean he won't listen to anything you have to say. Juve put Manchester United under pressure, but the home side's defending is stout. 18 mins: Edgar Davids gets booked for, I think, not letting Ruud Van Nistelrooy take a free-kick. Poor lamb. 19 mins: Zenoni upends Beckham just outside the Manchester United box and concedes a free. Juve are enjoying the lion's share of possession at the moment, but are lacking teeth in the final third of the field. 22 mins: Pavel Nedved unleashes a thunderbolt from all of 35 yards that fizzes narrowly wide of Barthez's right-hand post. 23 mins: Beckham puts a beautifully weighted free-kick into the Juve box and Neville flicks it on. Van Nistelrooy should be there somewhere to get on the end of it, but isn't. 25 mins: Van Nistelrooy loses possession on the edge of the Juventus box when he should have passed to Beckham alone in space. 26 mins: \"Emile Heskey watch out - Wes Brown is catching up!\" writes the peculiarly monikered Stjohn O'Connor. Nice. 27 mins: Ryan Giggs goes off to get treatment for a cut on his head. And before you all ask, there's no boots lying nearby and his manager isn't whistling in a \"who me?\" guilty fashion by the dug-out. 28 mins: Giggs comes back on with a big splodge of white goo on his forehead that makes him look as if he's been on the recieving end of the money-shot in a skin flick. I'm fairly certain he hasn't, so perhaps it's Vaseline or Sudocream. 30 mins: Montero attempts to con the ref into booking Nicky Butt, by running 30 yards, falling over and clutching his head. Funnily enough, it doesn't work. 32 mins: Under pressure, Trezeguet shoots from the edge of the box. It whistles narrowly right and wide. 36 mins: Paul Scholes gets a yellow card. I have no idea why, because I was investigating reports that my e-mail link isn't working. It should be now ... 37 minutes: ... but it still isn't. Silvestre concedes a free for obstruction against Nedved. Edgar Davids makes room for himself, but puts his left foot effort into the Stretford End. 39 mins: A Beckham free is deflected and bobbles around the Juventus box before being cleared by Davids. 40 mins: Great passing from Manchester United. Keane finds Beckham, who finds Neville, who picks out Scholes, who is dispossesed by the combined efforts of Pessotto and Chimenti. 42 mins: \"Flunky from GU Football AllTalk would like to know is Beckahm is playing in his girly Alice Band?\" says DMorris. \"Also, if Juve score, will you be able to say it 'flu' into the back of the net?\" No he isn't and no I won't. Actually, I probably will. 43 mins: Camoranesi drags a very clever free-kick across the front of the Manchester United box that tees Nedved up beautifully. His effort is poor. 45 mins: Nedved goes down in a heap in the box under pressure from Silvestre. Kim Nielson (the ref who sent off Beckham in the World cup all those ... blah, blah, blah) waves play on. Good decision. \"I'd like to throw a size 10 predator at the techies in the Guardian, as the link to your e-mail appears to have crashed,\" writes Niall Crowley. \"I hope Ashley Cole and a member of the Arsenal backroom staff have heard about it. I'm off to demand an apology.\" You can throw what you like at them Niall, but they're too engrossed in their games of Dungeons &amp; Dragons to notice. The worst that'll happen is they'll retaliate and you'll end up with a two-inch high, half-painted lead model orc embedded in your skull. Half-time 46 mins: The second half gets underway. Steve Woodburn attempts to sort out my e-mail link from the other side of the world, but unfortunately I'm too thick to know what he's talking about. \"I'm beginning to doubt the veracity of these 'computer crashes' you seem to have every other night. I'm wondering if yourself and Mr. Ingle aren't just reconvening to the pub for a few worthwhile drinks to help the creative juices flow easier. It's not a criticism, as the reports are highly entertaining, but seeing as Mr Ingle isn't working tonight, do we expect your PC to behave itself? You can be honest with your readers even if you are only a BIFFO (Big Ignorant F***** From Offaly),\" speculates Paul McD, \"in Sydney, Australia, who is just on his way to work.\" Notice how Paul very kindly mentions that Sydney is in Australia. Just for those of us who may not know. I'm afraid all the computer crashes are genuine, as it happens. For your information, Seanie Ingle rarely samples a sniff of the cork. Sneaking off to the gym for a few quick bench-presses is his particular poison. Meanwhile, Dr Tommy de Graft, former Minister of In-House Scars, MUFC writes: \"A de-knighting of Sir Alex is a necessary exercise to enable erring footballers all over the world to come to terms with their shortcomings on a professionally acceptable basis and to advance the cause of reconciliation and facial enhancement.\" If I exposed Dr Tommy as Rolf from Sweden, would you think I was lying? \"Who would you say more resemble the free flowing style of the world champs Milwaukee Rampage at the moment?\" enquires the delightfully monikered Tige Prickett. Tige Prickett? What the hell did you do to deserve that name? Apart from be born American, obviously. You must be really good at golf with a name like that. Fred Funk eat your heart out. \"Instead of all this pre-war talk and slowly building up of troops around Iraq, America should pull off a 'Ferguson' and take a swift, unexpected cheap shot to the head of Saddam,\" writes Chris Berggren from Salt Lake City, where I thought all the blokes blokes with 15 wives instead of computers. 47 mins: Juventus win a corner which is swung into the box. Ferrara gets his head to it, but can't control the ball. 49 mins: Tacchinardi gets booked, and my unerring inability to notice why people are getting cards waved in their faces means I have no idea what he did to deserve it. Trezeguet has a pop from distance, but Barthez gets down early to save. 51 mins: Silvestre limps off to be replaced by John O'Shea. Will everybody please stop mailing me to tell me my email link isn't working. Am I the only one who recognises the irony? And while I appreciate your attempts to help, I really am too much of a PC moron to follow your instructions. Paul Scholes is clipped by Zalayeta on the edge of the Juventus box. I'd say the free-kick is in \"Beckham Territory\", but that's a cliche. 54 mins: Beckham hammers his free-kick into the Juventus wall. 55 mins: O'Shea does brilliantly to dispossess Camoranesi and pass the ball down the line too Van Nistelrooy. He's fouled by Ferrara. 56 mins: O'Shea finds Van Nistelrooy with another peach of a pass. In turn, Ruud tries to pick out Beckham, in the process disproving The Clash's theory that 'Ruud(i) Can't Fail'. 58 mins: \"Your email ain't working cause the 'complicated thingy' [My words - BG] contains 'mail to' instead of 'mailto' and you don't need all that guff before mailto either. Oh and come on Liverpool,\" writes Tom Dabson. In an email. Which I received. 61 mins: Shocking refereeing by Nielson. Ruud van Nistelrooy tried to round Chimenti in the Juve goal. He was clearly tripped, but got no penalty. The ball fell to Scholes who failed to score from a narrow angle. One can only imagine that the referee was hoping Scholes would slot it home so that he wouldn't have to do anything so brave as make a decision. Chimenti probably can't believe his luck - he should have conceded a penalty and got his marching orders. Instead, Juve get away with it. 63 mins: O'Shea and Van Nistelrooy combine again. He of the equine features swings his right foot on the edge of the box, but his shot goes right and wide. 65 mins: \"While the scratch on Beckham's head was only small, did anyone notice the automaton manner in which Beckham parroted almost word-for-word what Fergie had said the other day. I think Fergie is a secret Jedi Knight and used a Jedi Mind Trick to ...\" (The minute-by-minute reporter reserves the right to shorten mails from Paul McDevitt in Toronto on the grounds that he's clearly a big nerd.) 67 mins: Zalayeta heads a Nedved cross this wide of Barthez's right stick. 69 mins: Gary Neville recovers well to put a stop to a David Trezeguet gallop into the Man Utd box. The Juve attacker shakes his head ruefully. Michael Casagranda sends a very, very, very long e-mail saying that contrary to my opinion, Georgie Bush was actually elected by the majority of the people of America. He should probably read Michael Moore's Stupid White Men. In fact every single one of you should read Stupid White Men. 73 mins: \"If you do make a 'ball flu into the net' joke when Juventus score (see 42 mins), I will personally send you a fiver from the US. I'm sure others would also be willing. Why not? It's a good way for you to be rewarded for your craft AND make one of the greatest commentating jokes of all time!\" writes Joe Frick from Washington, who obviously thinks I can be bought cheaply. How right he is - come on Juventus! 74 mins: Wes Brown clears from the edge of the six yard box with an excellent header under pressure from Camoranesi. 77 mins: This is shaping up to be one of those finales which, while entertaining enough, almost certainly isn't going to yield another goal. Scholes fails to get on the end of a dinky Giggs backheel into the box. He appears to have a groin strain and goes off to be replaced by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. 80 mins: Roy Keane gets booked for a clumsy tackle on Davids. Who'd have thunk both those lads would get their names taken tonight? 81 mins: Juventus attack, Ferdinand clears with his head. 82 mins: O'Shea and Van Nistelrooy combine brilliantly down the left wing again. The Irishman is unlucky not to get a cross in, but does end up winning a corner. He's been excellent since coming on. 83 mins: Pessotto floors Beckham with a lunge from behind. 84 mins: GOAL Manchester United 2 - 0 Juventus Beckham broke from midfield and delivered a peach of a ball into the area between the six yard box and the edge of the penalty area. Van Nistelrooy stuck a foot out, got his toe to it and steered it past Chimenti into the back of the net. Great goal. 87 mins: \"Well, my Mac read your email link fine. It's nice having a computer that can figure something out on its own and make the correction for you,\" chirrups Josh Braarud Plymouth, Massachusetts. And so say all of us. 89 mins: Despite being two goals down with mere minutes on the clock, Juventus haven't folded in deckchair-like fashion, as you'd have expected. Giggs goes off and is replaced by Diego Forlan. And yes, I'm aware I said there was little chance of this game yielding another goal. I didn't say there was no chance, though. 90 mins: GOAL: Manchester United 2 - 1 Juventus See! A Nedved cross/shot is deflected past Barthez by Rio Ferdinand. It flu into the net. That'll be \u00a35 please, Joe Frick (72 mins). 92 mins: Manchester United play out the clock. They've have earned their three points tonight. Juventus have been dogged without looking too impressive. Sir Alex Ferguson's team now have a five point lead over the Old Lady at the top of Group D, which they will take to Turin next week. Meanwhile, on the subject of my technical issues, Josh Braarud is back with some advice: \"You simply have to bribe the tech support with Doritos and Red Bull,\" he explains. \"It's their catnip and they'll give you anything afterwards.\" Anything? No, I won't even go there. Meanwhile in Misouri, Dave Ormerod (who may or may not be related to Southampton striker Brett) has this to say: \"Salutations, but is United's performance really as bad as it sounds? You said only two positive statements about them in the first half and mention not a single shot on goal.\" Believe me Dave, that's two more positive things than I usually have to say about that shower of yahoos. Although it pains me to say it, tonight's was an accomplished, professional performance against a good side. They only need a point now to get into the quarter finals. \"Can i just say i'd like to throw a boot at Ashley Cole safe in the knowledge I would escape punishment as he'd dive, at lightning and expert speed, thus avoiding getting hit,\" writes Steffy, who clearly has \"Ashley issues\". \"Dude, you are, like, the anti-Nostradamus,\" writes Bernard O'Leary. \"The way all your predictions are invariably wrong is uncanny. Could you do me a favour? Write 'Bernard O'Leary won't win the lottery on Saturday.' If it works, I swear I'll give you a cut.\" Right, you can stick a fork in me, because I'm done. Thanks for your time and your emails, many of which I have not read yet. I'm sure my harem of nubile, leggy personal assistants will whittle the remainder down to a manageable few and read them to me at bedtime tonight. All the best, Baz. Just one last thing though: Bernard O'Leary will emphatically not win the lottery on Saturday.
