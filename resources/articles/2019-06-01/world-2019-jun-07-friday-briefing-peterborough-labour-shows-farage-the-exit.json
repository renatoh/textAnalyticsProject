Labour has held on to Peterborough, defeating predictions of a first byelection victory to Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party. The new MP, Lisa Forbes, said: \u201cThe fact that the Brexit party have been rejected here in Peterborough shows that the politics of division will not win.\u201d Farage left the count through a back door minutes before the result was announced. Forbes won 10,484 votes, beating the Brexit party\u2019s Mike Greene who took 9,801 votes \u2013 a margin of 683. The Conservatives were beaten into third place with 7,243 votes. Turnout was 48%. After the result, Jeremy Corbyn said the Tories had been pushed to the margins because of their cuts and disastrous handling of Brexit. \u201cI look forward to welcoming Lisa to parliament next week,\u201d he said. The victory will help Corbyn in his fight with critics within the party who want him to change course and emphatically back a second Brexit referendum.

The departure of Karen Wheeler is seen as increasing the risk of a chaotic no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Today, as Theresa May steps down to become only a caretaker PM, contenders to replace her are being warned that they will probably face an immediate confidence vote in the Commons. The government survives on a handful of DUP votes, and some Conservative MPs have deep reservations about serving under a PM who is prepared to leave the EU without a Brexit deal on 31 October, such as Boris Johnson or Dominic Raab (Gaby Hinsliff highlights that the latter seems prepared to suspend parliament to ram a no-deal Brexit through). Labour sources have said they believe government whips may be planning an early recess, before the Tory leadership contest is decided in the week of 22 July. Downing Street has said May \u201cfully expects that the house will ensure it is sitting when a new prime minister is appointed\u201d. * * * NHS failing on diversity \u2013 The proportion of black and minority ethnic people in the most senior roles at NHS trusts in England has dropped from 15% in 2010 to just 8%, research shows. The proportion of women in those posts has also fallen from 47% in 2002 to only 38% \u2013 fuelling claims that the health service is going backwards on diversity and inclusion. The 38% of chair and non-executive director roles filled by women stands in stark contrast to 77% of the NHS workforce being female. The report by the NHS Confederation blames the gaps in female and BME representation on the abolition in 2012 of the NHS Appointments Commission and the move, begun during Tony Blair\u2019s premiership, to let NHS trusts become semi-independent foundation trusts. The confederation is calling for an urgent overhaul of the appointments procedures. * * * Transphobia row on campus \u2013 All 12 members of Edinburgh University\u2019s LGBT+ committee have resigned in a protest against university authorities after a feminist meeting on Wednesday night that featured speakers who have criticised proposed reforms to transgender rights. The campaigner Julie Bindel was allegedly verbally abused and lunged at by a transgender activist following the meeting about the future of women\u2019s sex-based rights. Bindel underlined that she had been talking about male violence, not transgender issues, at the event. The university row reflects broader tensions around proposed changes to gender recognition legislation in Scotland. Lucy Hunter-Blackman, another panellist and an Edinburgh University researcher, has been critical of proposed changes to the next census around the question of biological sex. * * * Embezzling MP jailed \u2013 The former MP for Glasgow East, Natalie McGarry, has been sent to jail for 18 months for stealing more than \u00a325,000 from Scottish independence campaign groups. Women for Independence (WfI), one of the groups, expressed frustration at the lack of alternatives to prison available to the courts. McGarry pleaded guilty in April to taking money from WfI and the SNP\u2019s Glasgow regional association. The court heard of McGarry\u2019s mental ill health starting before she entered parliament in 2015, including depression and anxiety as well as postpartum depression. McGarry, 37, broke down in the dock as her lawyer told the court she had suffered a miscarriage this week. Labour\u2019s Margaret Curran, who lost her seat to McGarry in the 2015 general election, said: \u201cNatalie and I had our differences but this seems such a harsh sentence for a mother of a young child. This must make the case for sentencing reform.\u201d * * * \u2018Huawei is shoddy\u2019 \u2013 Don\u2019t be surprised if and when China\u2019s bellicose state press latches on to comments from within spy agency GCHQ that the telecoms company Huawei is a maker of \u201cshoddy\u201d systems. \u201cThe security is objectively worse [than other companies\u2019] and we need to cope with that,\u201d said Ian Levy, technical director of Britain\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre. The US has led allegations that Beijing can use Huawei\u2019s equipment for espionage. British officials have also raised concerns about security issues but said they can manage the risks and have seen no evidence of spying. Asked about how Huawei compares with its competitors, Levy told a London conference: \u201cCertainly nothing is perfect, certainly Huawei is shoddy, the others are less shoddy.\u201d Britain\u2019s National Security Council decided in April to block Huawei from all core parts of its future 5G network but to give it restricted access to non-core parts. Today in Focus podcast: Goodbye to Maybot John Crace, Guardian sketch writer, first coined the term \u201cthe Maybot\u201d in 2016 after a car crash interview had the PM robotically repeating the same phrases. Today, as she steps down as Conservative leader, Crace discusses who might take over. Plus: the Guardian\u2019s Suzanne Wrack on the start of the Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup. Lunchtime read: Summer hit is the new Christmas single In 2013 it was the relentless funk of Daft Punk\u2019s Get Lucky. Last year it was a three-way tie between Calvin Harris and Dua Lipa\u2019s One Kiss, Drake\u2019s God\u2019s Plan and George Ezra\u2019s Shotgun \u2013 those songs went on to become the biggest sellers of the year. In the UK, it used to be all about the Christmas No 1. But as we purchase less music directly and swing behind streaming, the summer, stretching from as early as April to late September, is much more lucrative. So what alchemy brings about a Shotgun or Despacito \u2013 and who are this year\u2019s contenders? Sport The biggest Women\u2019s World Cup in history is kicking off at the Parc des Princes today but in Paris there is not the air of anticipation you would expect. Gareth Southgate has thrown his support behind John Stones and Ross Barkley after dreadful errors in extra-time condemned England to their latest semi-final defeat to the Netherlands. In the Cricket World Cup, Australia beat West Indies by 15 runs at Trent Bridge in a topsy-turvy match to which not only players but the umpires contributed quixotically. England Women got their summer off to a brilliant start at Leicester, hitting their highest one-day international total against West Indies \u2013 318 for nine \u2013 before bowling them out for 110 to finish with a 208-run win. At the French Open, the 17-year-old Amanda Anisimova produced a stunning performance to defeat defending champion Simona Halep in the quarter-finals. Meanwhile, Rafael Nadal still looks unbeatable on the red clay of Paris but the 38-year-old Roger Federer believes he can end his run. Lewis Hamilton has expressed his confidence going into the Canadian Grand Prix, as Mercedes bring their first upgraded engine to the race. And Amir Khan has defended the choice of location for his next fight in the face of human rights concerns by claiming Saudi Arabia is undergoing significant change. Business Asian shares have mostly been higher on investor optimism about a possible trade deal between the US and Mexico before tariffs take effect. The Nikkei, Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and the Hang Seng made gains while the Shanghai Composite fell. A modest Wall Street rally gained strength in the final hour of trading after Bloomberg reported that the US was considering delaying a 5% tariff on Mexican goods. The pound is worth $1.269 and \u20ac1.126 while the FTSE should open around a quarter of a percent higher. The papers The same photo is splashed across many of the front pages today: six-year-old George Sayer holding hands with veteran John Quinn during D-day commemorations. Among them the Daily Mail, which has the headline \u201cThank you for our freedom\u201d, the Mirror: \u201cFreedom in our hands\u201d, the Express: \u201cThank you for giving me my future\u201d, the i: \u201cThank you\u201d and the Sun, though its lead story is that two men are considering suing Camelot unless it pays their \u00a34m scratchcard jackpot: \u201cIt could be sue\u201d. The Guardian also has a photograph of a D-day veteran but the lead story is \u201cNHS drive for diversity in key roles \u2018going backwards\u2019\u201d. The Telegraph similarly has a D-day pic but its main story is: \u201cOnly Boris can fight off Farage, polls finds\u201d. The Times has a picture of Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron watching D-day commemorations, but its main story is: \u201cMPs fear Qeeen will be dragged into Brexit\u201d. The FT steers clear of D-day altogether, instead splashing on a row between the prime minister and her chancellor ahead of her last day in office: \u201cHammond puts up barriers over May\u2019s plan for \u00a310bn parting gift\u201d.
