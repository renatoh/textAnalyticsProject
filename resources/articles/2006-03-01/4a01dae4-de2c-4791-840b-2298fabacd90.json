Abdul Rahman, 41, had been due to go on trial for apostasy - abandonment of faith - a crime punishable by death but on Monday the courts dropped the case, saying he was mentally ill. Mr Rahman, who has been offered asylum by Italy, said he was fine and willing to die for his faith. Several Muslim clerics threatened to have him killed on his release, and street protests are expected against the ruling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
