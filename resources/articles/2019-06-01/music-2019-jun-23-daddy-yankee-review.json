Muchos gracias!\u201d Ram\u00f3n \u201cDaddy Yankee\u201d Ayala tells a venue full nearly to bursting with Saturday night party people. He\u2019s probably said that to every crowd on his Europe-wide arena tour, but reggaeton\u2019s presiding international name has a way of instilling compliments with credibility. A 25-year veteran \u2013 he\u2019s a young-looking 42 \u2013 he practises a form of stagecraft rooted in the old-fashioned idea that he\u2019s there to entertain, which means flattering and flirting. The mainly female crowd roars, Puerto Rican flags flutter and Daddy, viewing his people from behind black perma-shades, slides into a slinky Qu\u00e9 Tengo Que Hacer Projected behind him, an unsettling emoji styled to look like an infant Daddy nods along as the real deal pats his heart, overcome. If English is ceding ground to Spanish as pop\u2019s primary language, the gigantic success of Daddy\u2019s Gasolina and his Luis Fonsi collaboration Despacito deserve much of the credit. Tonight\u2019s setlist, executed with the help of a keyboardist, backing vocalists and muscular dancers, is entirely, triumphantly in Spanish. Unless he\u2019s singing directly at the \u201cbeautiful, bonita women\u201d, as on Dura \u2013 when he slows down to a smouldering amble \u2013 Daddy\u2019s rap-inflected rhyming tends to be breakneck, spat so fast that non-Spanish-speakers pick up only the odd word. Yet his show couldn\u2019t be more inclusive. The man is a party-starter by design, and fills the set with explosive, hooky songs that need no translating, building to Despacito\u2019s sleek tropical groove. Having sung them thousands of times has only honed his ability to drive them resoundingly home, whatever language his audience speaks. This Latino party could be an anywhere party."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
