Mark Walker, the head of the West Ham United Independent Supporters\u2019 Association (WHUISA), has said he plans to stay away from games for the foreseeable future. He questioned why senior figures at West Ham had not offered more backing after he became the target of an online campaign orchestrated by a rival fan organisation, some of whose founders are former hooligans and which has links with an unrelated group condemned by anti-racism campaigners. \u201cIt was quite scary,\u201d Walker told the Guardian. \u201cSome of the things that were written and sent made me fearful for my safety. After showing West Ham so much loyalty for so long, it would have been nice to have something to show it was recognised that it was a difficult situation. They could have done and said something. I can understand not wanting to get into the weeds of it but they could have made it clear we\u2019re a football family and these sort of things can\u2019t be tolerated. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of upset about what\u2019s happened and the failure of the board to condemn the kind of comments that have gone around to a lot of people. A lot of supporters now want to stay away and unfortunately I seem to have become the focal point for a lot of that.\u201d Walker, who says he has endured sleepless nights, expressed particular disappointment with Karren Brady for not speaking out on his behalf. The abuse has gone on for a week and has seen the 35-year-old has received threatening text messages from unknown numbers and attacks on Facebook from members of the Real West Ham Fans Group (RWHFG), which was set up this season by Andy Swallow and Micky Morgan, founder members of the infamous unofficial Inter City Firm. Although Walker has not made an allegation of any wrongdoing to West Ham, he insists the club is aware of it and that it has offered only to move his four season tickets to another part of the stadium. \u201cIt would help relations massively if the club would issue some form of words and I especially expect that of Brady because she is in the House of Lords, so is held to a much higher degree than everyone else,\u201d Walker said. \u201cFor her to not condemn what\u2019s happened is particularly disappointing for me.\u201d The march had initially been called for by the RWHFG, which was known as the Real West Ham Fans Action Group until last week, amid rising dissatisfaction with West Ham\u2019s struggles. The prospect of a major protest through Stratford grabbed West Ham\u2019s attention and on 19 February a meeting was arranged between the board and representatives from a coalition of 15 fan groups, including Morgan, Swallow and Walker. Although the club\u2019s owners, David Gold and David Sullivan, were not there, Brady, the vice-chairman, was present. Brady later sent a nine-page open letter to the groups, outlining the various issues discussed and thanking the attendees for a \u201chighly constructive\u201d meeting. WHUISA was surprised the letter revealed that Sullivan, by far the most influential figure at West Ham, held a three-and-a-half-hour meeting with \u201cthe lead representatives coordinating these groups\u201d a week earlier. West Ham have not denied that Swallow, who has links with the controversial Football Lads Alliance, visited Sullivan\u2019s house. \u201cHe wanted to know what the march was about and I met him to tell him,\u201d Swallow said . \u201cHe asked us if we could stop it. We said \u2018no\u2019. He asked what it would take to stop it. I said for the groups to meet the board. Then we set up the meeting.\u201d A day after Brady held a second meeting with supporter groups on 28 February, the RWHFG announced that the march was off, arguing that it was satisfied the club were listening to its concerns. However, that caused anger and surprise among many supporters. WHUISA stepped up at the behest of its 1,500 members, only for the RWHFG to focus on Walker\u2019s past work for the Labour party and his support for Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London. \u201cICF ain\u2019t having it you will not march to our ground,\u201d Swallow posted on Facebook. The toxic mood raised questions about why West Ham\u2019s board was willing to meet the RWHFG\u2019s leaders. The club\u2019s argument is that their hand was forced because they were organising the march and were part of a broader fan coalition that included Walker. Swallow repeatedly turned down opportunities to express sympathy for Walker during an interview with the Guardian and denied claims he received any incentives from West Ham to cancel the march. He said the club would not deal with him any more and were reluctant in the first place because of his ICF past. It is understood the club will not deal with the RWHFG again. Minutes from the second meeting suggest that a question from Swallow led Brady to say that the club would seek to reimburse those who had made arrangements to travel for the march and \u201clook at providing match tickets\u201d. Swallow, who said the FLA is \u201cagainst all forms of extremism\u201d and insisted he has no far-right leanings, will be handing out 40 complimentary tickets for Saturday\u2019s game to RWHFG members at a bar before kick-off. However, he told the Guardian that the club had not given him the tickets. West Ham declined to comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
