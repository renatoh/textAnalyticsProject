In a carefully calibrated speech, its platform hastily relocated from Newcastle to London\u2019s Mansion House because of the severe weather, the prime minister will make a deliberate overture to anxious remain voters. \u201cWe must bring our country back together, taking into account the views of everyone who cares about this issue, from both sides of the debate\u201d, she will say, addressing her own divided party, as well as the public. She will insist that the EU referendum result in 2016 was \u201cnot a vote for a distant relationship with our neighbours\u201d. May\u2019s intervention, the last of a series of speeches by key cabinet ministers, comes at the end of a tumultuous week, in which she has clashed with Brussels over the issue of Northern Ireland, and seen Jeremy Corbyn praised by business groups for his decision to endorse a customs union. She will make clear that Britain is aiming at a free-trade deal with Brussels, not a customs union, but will insist it should be \u201cthe broadest and deepest possible agreement, covering more sectors and cooperating more fully than any free trade agreement anywhere in the world today\u201d. Downing Street hopes her emollient tone will help assuage the concerns of backbench Tory rebels considering voting against the government on forthcoming legislation, including the trade bill, to force a softer Brexit. With Britain hoping negotiations in Brussels will shift to the nature of the economic relationship after EU leaders meet this month, May will also set out five tests that she says any deal must meet. As well as her long-held pledge to \u201ctake back control\u201d of Britain\u2019s borders, laws and money, she will insist any agreement must be \u201cconsistent with the kind of country we want to be as we leave, a modern, open, outward looking, tolerant, European democracy\u201d. She will warn that any new relationship must protect jobs and security; and be enduring so that both sides do not end up back at the negotiating table. And after a week in which the Irish border has sparked a fresh clash between Britain and Brussels, she will say the deal must \u201cstrengthen the precious union\u201d for all. Speeches early in May\u2019s premiership pledging a \u201cred, white and blue Brexit\u201d, and criticising footloose \u201ccitizens of nowhere\u201d, underlined concerns in her own party that she had read the referendum result as a signal to jettison the liberal Conservatism championed by David Cameron. But in the speech, which was signed off by every member of her cabinet at a specially convened meeting on Thursday, she will insist she can reconcile the Brexiters\u2019 desire to reclaim sovereignty, with a close continuing relationship with the EU. \u201cWhile the means may change our shared goals surely have not \u2013 to work together to grow our economies and keep our people safe,\u201d she will say. She will set out more details of the \u201cmanaged divergence\u201d strategy struck at last week\u2019s Chequers awayday with her eleven-strong Brexit strategy team. That would mean pledging to maintain high regulatory standards, while retaining the power to allow Britain\u2019s rules to diverge from the EU\u2019s over time. The EU27\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has repeatedly demanded a clearer picture from May and her colleagues of what they hope to achieve. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said the pressure on May was intense, after Labour\u2019s policy shift was welcomed by businesses and trade unions. Starmer told the Guardian: \u201cThe test for Theresa May is whether she can follow Labour\u2019s lead. Can she overcome the deep divisions within her government and set out a coherent, credible vision for Britain\u2019s future relationship with the European Union after Brexit? Can she stand up to the extreme Brexiters within her party and lead the country through the most difficult negotiations in our country\u2019s recent history? It\u2019s a test of leadership, strength and resilience. If she fails this test Labour is waiting in the wings.\u201d Several key ministers had already been given drafts of the speech to look over on Wednesday evening; but others got just half an hour to read it at No 10 before Thursday\u2019s cabinet meeting began. Brexiters demanded a number of minor changes to ensure it was sufficiently \u201coptimistic\u201d. May expressed to Donald Tusk, the European council president, her disquiet about the European commission\u2019s proposals for dealing with the border in Northern Ireland. He had a longer than expected meeting with her in Downing St at lunchtime on Thursday. Tusk warned the prime minister that it was down to her to find a solution to the Northern Ireland border problem if she rejected the commission\u2019s backstop plan for a common customs area across the island. As they posed for a photocall Tusk could also be heard telling May that he did not like her \u201cred lines\u201d. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Friday morning, Starmer said he agreed with May\u2019s rejection of the commission\u2019s proposal, but echoed Tusk in saying she needed, then, to come up with a solution. \u201cI agree with her: it\u2019s simply not a road that we could go down. But that really ramps up the pressure on her to say what is the answer. \u201cOn Monday, Labour answered that question \u2013 we stepped up to that challenge and said: \u2018Look, a customs union with the EU, a strong single market relationship, is a long way to answering this question\u2019. \u201cTheresa May needs to follow. So, I agree with her in rejection of what was put on the table on Wednesday, completely agree with her about that. But, really, it puts the ball so firmly in her court that she has got to deal with it today.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
