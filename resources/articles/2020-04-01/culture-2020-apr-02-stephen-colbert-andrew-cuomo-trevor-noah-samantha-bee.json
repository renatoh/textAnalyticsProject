Well, I think the tide is rising.\u201d On Wednesday, the White House announced they project between 100,000 to 240,000 Americans will die of Covid-19. \u201cAnd with these devastating projections, it seems like President Trump now understands the gravity of the situation we\u2019re all in.\u201d As in, he called the coronavirus \u201cinteresting\u201d at his press conference and mused that people \u201ccan\u2019t get enough of it\u201d. \u201cYes, this pandemic which is crippling the global economy certainly is \u2026 interesting,\u201d said Colbert. \u201cIt reminds me of Winston Churchill: \u2018We shall fight them on the beaches, we shall fight them on the landing grounds. Why? Because it\u2019s interesting!\u2019\u201d One leader who is responding well to the crisis? New York\u2019s Governor Andrew Cuomo, who has \u201cprojected an air of much-needed competence during the epidemic,\u201d said Colbert, \u201cand the people. Are. There. For. It.\u201d The hashtag #presidentcuomo has been trending on Twitter, and a Jezebel op-ed asked \u201cHelp, I Think I\u2019m In Love With Andrew Cuomo???\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s OK, these feelings are perfectly natural,\u201d joked Colbert. \u201cMany Americans experience moments of being at least Andrew-curious, if not fully Cuomo-sexual.\u201d Colbert noted, however, that the obsession with Cuomo was heading to a \u201creally weird place\u201d \u2013 specifically, online chatter about whether or not a photo of the governor indicated pierced nipples. Colbert assessed the evidence and concluded: \u201cWho cares what\u2019s really underneath that polo shirt? The governor\u2019s doing a good job!\u201d Trevor Noah On the Daily Social Distancing Show, Trevor Noah discussed how Trump, \u201cwho usually treats his daily briefings like the last scene in Scarface, came out yesterday and acted for the first time ever like he had also been reading the news\u201d. At Wednesday\u2019s press briefing, he struck what many news outlets called a \u201cdarker\u201d tone. \u201cGod damn, Donald Trump for the first time at least sounds like he\u2019s afraid of this virus,\u201d said Noah. \u201cAnd if he\u2019s taking it seriously, then we should be really scared. Because I mean, this guy takes nothing seriously. This is the same dude who stared at an eclipse like it was a magic eye painting. The same dude who sang Hakuna Matata when he assassinated an Iranian general. The same dude who responded to a hurricane with a paper towel three-point contest. So this is a side of Donald Trump we don\u2019t often get. I haven\u2019t seen Trump this somber since Maury told him that he was Eric\u2019s father. \u201cAnd if the president is finally treating the crisis with a little more respect, maybe it\u2019s because of the numbers,\u201d said Noah, referencing the chilling death range of 100,000-240,000 Americans released by the White House on Wednesday. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t care what anybody says, that is a staggering number,\u201d said Noah. \u201cEven in Call of Duty, if you saw that many deaths, you\u2019d be like, \u2018I think I\u2019ve been playing this game too much, I think I\u2019m going to switch to Animal Crossing for a while.\u201d Samantha Bee On Full Frontal, Samantha Bee focused on the pandemic\u2019s impact on American women. Many of the nation\u2019s most vulnerable frontline workers are women, Bee explained, especially nurses, and women are more likely to be low-wage or temporary workers who are the first to face layoffs when businesses shut down. Domestic workers, many of them undocumented immigrants who can\u2019t file for unemployment or stimulus relief, are mostly women and many are now out of work. \u201cAmerica: come for the low-paying jobs with no security, stay for the quarantines,\u201d Bee deadpanned. Meanwhile, several states such as Tennessee, Mississippi, Iowa, Oklahoma, Alabama and Ohio have declared abortions \u201cnon-essential services\u201d and ordered clinics to shut down. \u201cSome of these restrictions are being challenged, but that can\u2019t happen quickly enough,\u201d said Bee. \u201cNow, if you\u2019re, say, a dude, and you can\u2019t quite empathize, let me put this in terms you might understand,\u201d Bee explained. \u201cImagine driving hours to see your favorite band \u2013 which, if you\u2019re a middle-aged white guy, I assume is Pearl Jam. It\u2019s the only chance you\u2019ll ever have to see Pearl Jam play live and if you don\u2019t get to see Pearl Jam play live now, your life will never be the same. But then when you finally get to the concert, Pearl Jam refuses to go on. You\u2019re devastated. And then Eddie Vedder forces you to have a baby. \u201cThe idea that any abortion isn\u2019t essential is medically irresponsible,\u201d Bee continued. \u201cNot having access to safe and legal abortion is scary, dangerous and can even be lethal. And for victims of domestic abuse, so is just staying at home.\u201d Isolation is essential for stopping the spread of Covid-19, said Bee, but for the 10 million Americans suffering from domestic abuse, it\u2019s a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d, though support groups are going virtual, and there are hotlines available for help. Basically, \u201cCovid-19 hasn\u2019t made new problems for women, it\u2019s just exacerbated the old ones,\u201d said Bee. \u201cWe need to do a lot more for women during this crisis \u2013 starting with getting us all an emotional support Wilson,\u201d she said, referencing Tom Hanks\u2019s companion from Cast Away."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
