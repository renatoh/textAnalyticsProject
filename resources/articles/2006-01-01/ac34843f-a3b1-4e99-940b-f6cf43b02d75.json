He has been asked to chair a meeting of 13 sports governing bodies this spring with the aim of developing a single code on corruption in sports. The Football Association and the Jockey Club have already signed up to the scheme, sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which aims to improve communication between bookies and governing bodies and root out more cheats. Intriguingly, an invitation will go out to the British Darts Organisation, which last week dismissed reports of suspicious betting patterns in a world championship match at Frimley Green. Scotney has impressed since taking up his Jockey Club post two years ago and his department's investigations have prompted the huge police operation against 25 racing figures, including Kieren Fallon, the findings of which are currently being considered by the Crown Prosecution Service. Kaiser in wars over words An invitation from Franz Beckenbauer to celebrate, at a gathering next month, England's qualification for the World Cup finals does not inspire general confidence in the German organising committee. \"The United Kingdom Football Association national team has qualified for the 18th World Cup finals,\" declares the Kaiser's invite, a basic mistake which simultaneously offends the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland football associations and suggests attention to detail is not what it should be at World Cup HQ in Frankfurt. Ironically, it is sensitivity about retaining independence within Fifa, the world governing body, which prompted the Scots and Welsh to refuse to countenance joining a GB football team at the 2012 London Olympics. Fifa appears already to have written them off. Arnesen's eye off the ball The imminent transfer of Theo Walcott from Southampton to Arsenal is a blow to Frank Arnesen, below, Chelsea's sporting director, whose relentless negotiating techniques were one of the reasons Peter Kenyon was so keen to lure him from Tottenham. Arnesen was hired to collect Europe's best young talent, and missing out on the hottest property in English football is an embarassment. Chelsea's willingness to pay inflated prices to keep talented players from their rivals is no secret and Walcott and his advisers deserve some credit for resisting the riches on offer. Sources close to the deal say Chelsea offered Southampton \u00a34m more than Arsenal but it appears not to have been enough to tempt the teenager, who is wary of following Shaun Wright-Phillips into highly-paid limbo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
