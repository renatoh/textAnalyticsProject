The Olympic champion went more or less straight back into training after dispatching Julius Long less than a month ago and, at last, there are signs that he is getting serious about his business, perhaps realising as he approaches his 31st birthday that time is not on his side if he is ever to become more than a curiosity on the heavyweight scene. Like Harrison, Krence is undefeated and he will give little away in terms of height and reach, standing 6ft 5in. But Harrison is more than two stones heavier than the Chesterfield man and should have clear advantages in strength and power. Krence, 25, has won all 11 of his fights to date, but only two inside the distance. Nevertheless, he has overcome some well-known journeymen of the British ring, including Tony Booth, Nigel Rafferty and Luke Simpkin, which indicates this former ABA cruiserweight champion is not the sort of duffer Harrison has been accused of choosing as opposition so far. There can be no doubting Krence is fit after he easily out-pointed Nottingham's Gary Williams over six rounds 10 days ago, but Harrison should prove more proficient and score with the more meaningful shots even if Krence is sufficiently determined to last the distance. Naseem Hamed's promoter Barry Hearn has again insisted his fighter is serious in his wish to fight Marco Antonio Barrera again, despite Hamed's poor performance in overcoming Manuel Calvo on points on Saturday. Hamed was taking specialist medical advice yesterday over his damaged hands, which he claimed affected his display."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
