And they will have an impact across the country. But that\u2019s the reality we have to deal with.\u201d The four-hour session which ended just before midnight saw senators attempting to get reassurance from Scott that a raft of ABC services and programs would not be axed. But the managing director repeatedly declined, saying he would inform his staff on Monday before revealing anything in public. He refused to confirm anything was safe including regional radio, children\u2019s programming, popular TV programs and local current affairs. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that as best as possible the audiences won\u2019t suffer from the cuts we have to make,\u201d Scott said without guaranteeing the survival of any programs . Scott told the committee the cuts amounted to 8% of the ABC\u2019s $1.1bn budget and not 5% as claimed by communications minister Malcolm Turnbull in a speech on Wednesday. He explained that the 5% comes on top of a 3% reduction in funding through the termination of the Australia Network work contract and the efficiency cut imposed in the May budget. But his calculations were repeatedly disputed by the chair of the committee, South Australian Liberal senator Anne Ruston. Scott said that the ABC was loved by the public and in the latest annual ABC appreciation survey, conducted by the independent company Newspoll, 84% declared the ABC was performing a valuable role. Under questioning from South Australian independent senator Nick Xenophon, Scott agreed the ABC\u2019s Adelaide TV production centre was a valuable asset but said it was expensive to keep a single state-based internal studio running. Xenophon and Liberal MP Christopher Pyne are both fighting to keep the studio, which makes Dream Build, The Cook and the Chef, Poh\u2019s Kitchen and the Beatles\u2019 50th anniversary tour documentary, open. Scott did not confirm the studio would close but argued it was inefficient. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to operate in a way that is efficient and effective you\u2019ve got a look at how many studios you run,\u201d Scott said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
