Like all the company\u2019s 20,000 employees, they had just been given a bonus of \u20ac9,100 (\u00a37,735); sales and profits were soaring; Porsche was investing \u20ac1bn in new models; and, in the sparkling southern German spring sunshine, their future as skilled craftsmen looked secure, well rewarded and full of promise. \u201cI am optimistic. We make the best cars and we have a good employer,\u201d said one man. \u201cI am young, but I have bought a house and next year I hope to buy a Porsche.\u201d But elsewhere the mood in Stuttgart, the car capital of Europe where the automobile was born in 1886 and where Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, Bosch and many major auto suppliers have their HQs, is far from confident. All the social, technological and political trends point to a rapid demise of the polluting internal combustion engine, the coming of electric cars and the end to German car dominance. In the wake of \u201cDieselgate\u201d, when VW was found to have cheated emission figures, and the arrival on the car scene of digital companies such as Uber, Tesla and Google, all jockeying to introduce driverless and electric cars, the sedate German industry is waking up to the fact that it may be left behind by the US and China and that if it does nothing its cars could soon seem like antisocial relics. \u201cThe industry is at a crossroads. German car companies have had their heads in the sand. They cannot compete with companies like Tesla, or with China, which will determine the future markets for the car. The Chinese market is 23 million cars a year. In Germany it is 3-4 million,\u201d says Christian Hochfeld, director of Berlin-based transport thinktank Agora. Because Germany sells its cars largely to China, the knock-on effects of what happens there will be huge, he says. \u201cThe plan by the Chinese to clean up pollution in their cities by introducing more and more electric cars will drive the global market. They are starting to build cars around batteries and are getting better and better. In a few years, Chinese cities will have quotas for electric cars, progressively closing down the market for petrol or diesels.\u201d Climate change, too, will force carmakers to go all-electric or, like Toyota, to use hydrogen. \u201cAfter the Paris climate agreement in 2015 we know that industry has to be decarbonised to meet carbon targets. Either it does something very serious or it will never meet its targets,\u201d he says. With one in three of all industrial workers in Stuttgart in the car industry, the unions see the coming decarbonised world as dangerous. An internal combustion engine has about 1,200 parts, an electric motor only 200, suggesting far fewer workers will be needed, says Frederic Speidel, head of strategy at IG Metall, Germany\u2019s biggest union with more than 500,000 car workers. But rather than resist the coming revolution, Speidel wants the companies to build more environmentally friendly cars and embrace the new electric, digitised auto world. \u201cChina is developing whole cities to develop only batteries. The battery will be 40% of the whole value of the car in the future world. Air pollution is dangerous,\u201d he says. \u201cDieselgate was the industry\u2019s Chernobyl and it has to do something. The classic internal combustion engine will sooner or later disappear. \u201cThe old world is still dominant in Germany but carmakers here are in a very difficult position,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is not the demand for the electric car yet, but there is the political necessity. We expect the EU to tighten new emission levels by the end of the year.\u201d Porsche plans to spend \u20ac1bn on an all-electric model, the Mission E, to be on the road by next year. Its vision, says Otmar Bitsche, director of e-mobility, is for one in four of its cars to be all-electric by 2025. On current output, that would mean about 60,000 electric cars a year. \u201cWe think it is possible to sell 20,000 a year in Europe by the end of 2020,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are not late getting into the market, but we had to wait for battery technology to improve.\u201d But Germany lags behind some European countries in the electric car stakes. Norway, with just 5 million people, has more than 100,000, the UK has more than 35,000 registered but Germany, with 80 million people, has only 25,000. That will change fast, say industry watchers. EU carbon standards, which demand a fleet average of 95g CO2 per km by 2021 and much lower by 2025, will force carmakers to build and sell electric vehicles in large numbers, say analysts. \u201cWhat started with plug-ins and hybrids is moving quickly to fully electric and driverless cars,\u201d says a spokesperson for Magna, one the world\u2019s biggest car-parts firms, which supplies Ford and others. It expects hydrogen cars to be a long-term goal. \u201cElectrification is coming fast. I think one in three of all cars will be hybrids, plugins or full electric by 2030,\u201d says Claus Huisgen, director of global marketing at Getrag, part of the Magna group and the world\u2019s largest supplier of transmission systems. \u201cWe are definitely in a transition to the electric car. It is being driven by global trends like urbanisation, by CO2 emissions and by China. Electric is the only way to meet CO2 targets. \u201cI cannot see the end of the internal combustion engine globally, but the direction is clear. It may be phased out in some regions, like Europe and in mega-cities. China is requiring more and more pure electric cars and hybrids. The train has left the station but the timetable isn\u2019t clear. This is a period of great change.\u201d But Stuttgart has an immediate car problem. Surrounded by the steep hills of the Neckar valley, it is plagued by congestion, the worst air pollution in Germany and the construction of one of Europe\u2019s biggest infrastructure projects, a \u20ac6bn railway station. \u201cThe electric car cannot come fast enough to Stuttgart,\u201d said Katja Kruszynski, part of Bl Neckartor, a citizens\u2019 group taking the state to court for pollution breaches. \u201cCars dominate this city. It has 600,000 people and about 300,000 cars. This is the heart of the car world,\u201d she says. Last week, as nearly 900,000 cars a day drove through and into the city on four-lane motorways, the Green party mayor, Fritz Kuhn, issued another \u201cfeinstaubalarm\u201d, or \u201cfine particulate alert\u201d. But powerless for the moment to restrict traffic, fine drivers or stop anyone burning wood, there was little evidence of anyone leaving their cars at home . Kuhn, a Green mayor in a car capital, is in a difficult position. He might be expected to crack down on car culture but in Stuttgart he must steer carefully. \u201cWe need to reduce the number of cars. But it\u2019s a battle to be ecologically sound. It\u2019s OK for cities like Copenhagen [to ban cars] but they don\u2019t have a car industry. They don\u2019t have powerful car companies. \u201cThe industry here does not know where it wants to go. It says, \u2018You cannot ban the diesel\u2019 and economically that is understandable. The head of Mercedes tells me he needs the profits from diesel to have the money to invest in low-carbon cars. But if the industry wants to sell in China it will have to make environmentally friendly cars.\u201d The free-market opposition FDP party is horrified that, from January, it will be possible for the city to fine about 60,000 highly polluting cars from coming into certain parts of the city on \u201cfine dust\u201d days. Stuttgart broke EU pollution levels on 69 days last year, but there should be no restrictions on drivers, said Hans-Ulrich R\u00fclke, chairman of the FDP group in the state parliament. \u201cI have been hearing all this talk of electric cars for 20 years. It\u2019s always around the corner. Only 7% of all polluting emissions in Stuttgart come from the exhausts of cars and the problem is mostly dust, from brakes and construction. We reject the idea of diesel restrictions. We have to ensure health, but also the health of the economy. We don\u2019t think banning diesels or any car is the way,\u201d he said. City planner Wolfgang Forderer, charged with improving transport in Stuttgart, despairs of the car culture but has found money for more bike lanes, electric cars, walking routes, better information about pollution and charging points. \u201cThis is the beating heart of the world car industry. The reality is it is very hard to do anything against the car lobby. They are well organised. We are 100% over the pollution limits but persuading people not to use their cars is hard,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must change the way we think about cars. We need alternatives. The whole city of Stuttgart is a bottleneck and we have become completely car-oriented. The car people here say it is only a small part of the problem but it\u2019s not. The internal combustion engine is absolutely the problem.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
