Costello, who served as the treasurer in the Howard government from 1996 to 2007, said the Abbott government had increased the top marginal tax rate to its highest level in 25 years and was contemplating other changes that would make Australia uncompetitive. Costello pointed to tax proposals floated by the Coalition and other groups, suggesting they made the government\u2019s stated aim of \u201clower, simpler, fairer\u201d taxes look \u201clike some kind of morbid joke\u201d. But Hockey hit back at Costello\u2019s \u201cfree advice\u201d, saying the criticism of a proposed bank tax was \u201cwrong\u201d and people should not dwell in the past. \u201cI really wish \u2013 I really wish \u2013 that I had the tax revenue that Peter Costello had when we were last in government, because if we had the same level of tax collections, I\u2019d be collecting an extra $25bn today but unfortunately we do not have the revenue streams,\u201d Hockey told Sky News on Tuesday. \u201cEverybody is entitled to give free advice. Frankly, that\u2019s what it\u2019s worth. It\u2019s free advice. I would suggest that people stop looking back to what it was and focus on the challenges of today and the challenges of tomorrow, no matter who they are.\u201d Costello\u2019s critique comes as Hockey prepares his second budget at a time of plunging tax revenues associated with the sharp decline in iron ore prices. Hockey\u2019s budget last year was widely criticised as unfair because of a relatively greater impact on poorer households, and key measures were blocked by the Senate. The government is now considering changes to the eligibility of wealthier retirees to the part-pension, and adjustments to the taper rate, as an alternative to the stalled plan to reduce the size of annual increases to the pension. In an opinion piece in News Corp\u2019s Daily Telegraph, Costello argued against using both the tax and welfare system to redistribute income, saying it would result in \u201cpunishing rates of income withdrawal as a person\u2019s income rises\u201d and \u201ca huge disincentive to work\u201d along with \u201cpoverty traps\u201d. Costello said the conversation about tax had been \u201cdebased\u201d and was \u201cnot a conversation about fairer tax \u2013 it is about more tax\u201d. The government needed to \u201crestart the conversation about getting taxes down, not up\u201d. He said the government had suggested a new bank tax and an intention to collect more tax from multinationals, while other political parties and some thinktanks had proposed measures including higher tax on superannuation and higher taxes on property investment and capital gains. Costello said previous Labor and Coalition governments had pursued tax reform in which \u201cfairer taxes meant lower taxes\u201d. \u201cIn particular it meant lowering the reach or rate of top marginal income tax rates because, yes, high taxes can be unfair taxes when they take away a person\u2019s justly earned income and reduce the reward for effort,\u201d Costello wrote. \u201cSometimes tax reforms involved lower income earners paying more \u2013 like the introduction of the GST \u2013 but we were always clear that the welfare system could be used to compensate for that.\u201d Speaking on the ABC\u2019s AM program, Hockey said Costello was wrong about the bank tax. The measure \u201cwas in fact a Labor party tax and it was proposed by the Labor party and built into the budget by the Labor party\u201d, Hockey said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to do more with less,\u201d Hockey said of the budget situation. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, sought to capitalise on the dispute between Hockey and Costello, arguing the government was in disarray. \u201cI certainly think Peter Costello was a better treasurer than Joe Hockey,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cHe is right: Joe Hockey is a joke, but Australians stopped laughing a long time ago.\u201d But Shorten also gave a hint of the types of budget measures that Labor could support. He said the party was \u201chappy to have an intelligent discussion with the government\u201d about part-pension taper rates, but there was \u201cno way\u201d it would support \u201cacross the board cuts\u201d to pension indexation. The opposition leader also called for a focus on changes to superannuation tax concessions for high income earners. The prime minister, Tony Abbott, said Costello was \u201ca distinguished former treasurer\u201d who was entitled to his view \u201cbut this is a tax-cutting government as we\u2019ve already demonstrated by abolishing the carbon tax, by abolishing the mining tax and preparing as we are for a small business tax cut in the upcoming budget\u201d. The former Labor treasurer Wayne Swan described Costello\u2019s comments as \u201cdelusional\u201d. Swan said the Howard government had spent the vast majority of $334bn in revenue upgrades, whereas Labor had had to contend with a $160bn writedown in revenue in the five years from the beginning of the global financial crisis. Swan said Hockey had previously denied Australia had a revenue problem. \u201cThere\u2019s an enormous gap in Mr Hockey\u2019s rhetoric about his budget task. The truth is he like to portray his challenge as being a spending problem, when he\u2019s got a significant revenue problem,\u201d Swan said. \u201cHe\u2019s constantly alternating between scaremongering and sooking.\u201d The tension coincides with fresh conflict between the states over the distribution of GST revenue, with Hockey siding with Western Australia which argues it is unfair that its share will fall below 30% of the revenue collected in that state. But Hockey on Tuesday also called on the WA Coalition government to undertake structural changes including privatisation of state-owned businesses and deregulation of trading hours. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got to unshackle our economy and Western Australia in particular needs to unshackle its own economy by getting rid of some of the old paradigms, restrictions on retail trading hours, owning poles and wires. We\u2019ve got to keep up with the rest of the world to maintain our quality of living,\u201d Hockey said. Hockey was speaking from the US, where he is due to attend several economic meetings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
