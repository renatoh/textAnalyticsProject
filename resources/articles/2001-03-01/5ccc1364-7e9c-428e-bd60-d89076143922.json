Forty-five candidates, including one former MP, queued last Monday for a \"photo-opportunity\" with Lady Thatcher, who resigned as prime minister 11 years ago. Some Tory candidates privately admit that canvassing returns show William Hague is a turn-off to voters with many elderly ex-Tories, saying they would vote for the party if Lady Thatcher were still leader. As a result, some Tory candidates will ditch pictures of Mr Hague for the 75-year-old baroness in election addresses. Others will highlight both in their election addresses or issue press releases featuring Lady Thatcher during the campaign. Lady Thatcher is also expected to make constituency appearances for her most favoured candidates. The candidates keenest on Lady Thatcher include many in London and the south-east where the Tories lost seats in droves to Labour and the Liberal Democrats in 1997. Vivian Bendall, who is trying to wrest back his Ilford North seat from Labour (majority 3,224), said: \"I have always been an admirer of Lady Thatcher. I intend to use the picture in a press release during the campaign. Other candidates are planning to use them in their addresses. She still plays well on the doorstep.\" Among the people promoting Lady Thatcher are former key activists in the rightwing European Young Conservatives. Their leading light is Andrew Rosindell, who is fighting the ultra-Labour marginal Romford seat (majority 649) who has a picture of himself with Lady Thatcher at a London Freedom dinner with a backdrop of a union flag on the organisation's Denmark-based website. Other candidates planning to highlight Lady Thatcher include Adrian Lee, fighting Sittingbourne (Labour majority 1,929); Angela Watkinson, fighting Upminster( Labour majority 2,770); Jacob Rees-Mogg fighting The Wrekin (Labour majority 3,025); Ken Andrew, fighting Carshalton and Wallington (Liberal Democrat majority 2,267) ; Mark Macgregor fighting Thanet South (Labour majority 2,878) and Conor Byrne, fighting Eastleigh (Liberal Democrat majority 754). Other Thatcher supporters include Mark Field, standing for the Tory stronghold of Westminster and Jason Hollands, challenging home office minister, Barbara Roche in Hornsey and Wood Green (Labour majority 20,499). One candidate, who did not want to be named, said: \"I am finding that William Hague is not going down well at all. People don't think he will be the next PM and some are quite rude, describing him as a plonker. That is why I will be promoting Lady Thatcher during the campaign.\" Others like David Shaw, who is fighting the Liberal Democrat seat of Kingston (majority 56), who did not pose with Lady Thatcher, said: \"This view of William Hague is what people said about Lady Thatcher in 1979. They said there would never be a woman prime minister and that Mrs Thatcher was not the right woman anyway. She won.\" A spokesman for the Thatcher Foundation confirmed that the photo-opportunity took place. \"Lady Thatcher does this for every election,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
