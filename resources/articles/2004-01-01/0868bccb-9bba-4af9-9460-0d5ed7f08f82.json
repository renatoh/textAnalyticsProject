The creditors also said that they would not extend the deadline for Leeds to stave off administration beyond Friday. Should the consortium not be able to provide the necessary funds, it would mean Leeds having to indulge in a fire sale of players or, more likely, going back to the squad to see if they were willing to accept a wage deferral in order to raise the \u00a35m needed to see them survive through to the end of the season. Last night there were signs that the players were willing to accept the deferral, having initially rejected a 30% wage deferral last week. At the time that provoked a furious reaction from the club's fans who accused them of acting only in self-interest. Much of the criticism centred on the Professional Footballers' Association representative David Batty but his agent Hayden Evans said yesterday that the players would \"certainly\" accept a temporary cut in wages as a last resort. \"Yes of course if it comes to the last throw of the dice the players will certainly accept a deferral,\" said Evans, who also represents several other Leeds players. \"The players have never said they would not accept a cut if it was really necessary and it's my personal belief that they've had a lot of the blame for this whole mess unfairly heaped upon them. I think some other parties have probably pushed bad publicity their way,\" he added. The PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor said he intended to sit down with the players this week to discuss their options. Batty, who has been particularly hurt by the criticism, will send a series of personal emails to leaders of supporters' groups, website organisers and fanzines this morning. \"He wants to demonstrate his commitment to Leeds. There is no way David Batty would stand by and see Leeds go under if there was anything he could do to help prevent it,\" said Evans. Gerald Krasner, a specialist in corporate recovery at Bartfields accountants in Leeds, has revealed himself as the public face of the consortium of local businessmen who are seeking a \u00a320m takeover. The club's lawyers are studying the offer but it appears the chief executive Trevor Birch has received the approach coolly, particularly as the consortium has said the sale of some players was inevitable. Birch feels the only way Leeds can survive in the Premiership is by holding on to their players until the end of the season and is believed to favour the wage-deferral option as a means of saving the club. Last week he turned down a \u00a35m offer for the goalkeeper Paul Robinson and the midfielder James Milner in what is turning out to be a high-risk strategy. Krasner last night insisted that the consortium was close to a deal and had the necessary funding in place, saying that talks were \"well advanced and at a \"delicate stage\". \"A written offer has gone in though our lawyers with proof of funds,\" he said. The \u00a320m bid is believed to include the \u00a35m required in working capital to see the club through until the end of the season. Despite frenzied speculation, the former Bradford City chairman Geoffrey Richmond again denied any involvement yesterday. Other contenders include the Leeds-based entrepreneur Melvyn Levy, property developer Simon Morris and dotcom millionaire Paul Sykes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
