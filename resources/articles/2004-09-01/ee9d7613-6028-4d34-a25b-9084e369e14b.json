It recommends the introduction of \"voice vouchers\" which would shift at least 1% of a school's annual budget into the hands of parents, enabling them to decide collectively how and where money is spent. This would encourage parents to work together and take a more active role in the education of their children, the report claims. With a typical secondary school budget in the region of \u00a33m, that would give parents \u00a330,000, with the balance under the control of the governing body. The report was commissioned from Demos by the Hay Group as part of a research project into \"extended\" schools, which are designed to act as hubs within their communities and offer a wider range of services to local people of all ages."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
