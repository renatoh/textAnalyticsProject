Scholars now suggest that, in fact, Judas was merely \"fulfilling his part in God's plan\". Below, we pre-empt the possible rewriting of the gospel. 1 Jesus said to his disciples. \"I, the Son of Man, will be betrayed and crucified in two days.\" 2 At the same time, Caiaphas and the leading priests were discussing how to capture Jesus and kill him. 3 Then Judas Iscariot went to the priests and asked, \"Just as a hypothetical question, you understand. But how much will you pay me to betray Jesus to you?\" And they gave him 30 pieces of silver, which he immediately gave away to the poor, because that was the sort of thing he did. From that time on, Judas forgot all about this meeting and didn't begin to look for the right time and place to betray Jesus. 4 On the evening of the Passover supper, Jesus sat at the table with the 12 disciples. While they were eating, he said. \"One of you will betray me.\" 5 Greatly distressed, one by one, the disciples asked him, \"Am I the one, Lord?\" 6 He replied: \"I must die as the Scriptures declared. But how terrible it will be for my betrayer. Yet I would not go so far as to say it were better he had not been born, because Caiaphas is a bit dim and unless someone helps him out, no one is going to arrest me by Good Friday.\" 7 Judas, the one who had no intention of betraying him, also asked, \"Teacher, am I the one?\" 8 Jesus winked at him. \"You have said it yourself.\" 9 While the others were talking among themselves, Judas went among the hungry throng to hand out the leftovers he had saved. But in his heart he was sore distressed. \"Lord, save me from an appearance in an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical,\" he prayed. 10 Then Jesus retired to Gethsemane, where three times he prayed, \"Lord, take this Cup of suffering away from me,\" before returning to the disciples. \"Behold, my betrayer is here.\" 11 Even as he said this, Judas was trying to fend off a mob which had inexplicably arrived with him, saying, \"Jesus has left Jerusalem.\" 12 But Jesus stepped forward. \"You must betray me with a kiss for the Word to be fulfilled.\" 13 \"Forgive me, Lord,\" Judas sobbed. 14 Jesus blessed him. \"I forgive you now, but it will take everyone else 2,000 years.\" And so it came to pass."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
