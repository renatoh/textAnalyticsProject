We're used to golden-boy travellers who display on the road the feminine sensitivities that they had been denied at boarding-school; well, Eberhardt invented for herself a masculine Arab identity - pilgrim Si Mahmoud Essadi (she had already worked as a fake bloke on the Marseille docks). In his robes, and in the sublime state of mind of a Muslim mystic, she wandered Tunisia and Algeria between bitter visits back to her insane family in Europe and her marriage to a soldier. She can sound as posey as the adolescent girl she claims no longer to be (those who describe themselves as \"debauched cynics\" in their journals tend to be anything but). But when she can keep off the proto-Bridget Jones projects-for-a-better-self, and refrain from turning a real now instantly into a nostalgic then, she writes sparely and well of the Sahara, of an \"unkempt garden where the frogs croak all night long\". She is at her best when, poor, sick, temporarily parted from her husband, she lives a while in a tiny whitewashed room at the Bou Saada baths. She is fully realised at last, nowhere in particular in the soft grey Algerian weather, happy with with a mat, a line for her laundry, and the gravelly deserts all around. Person and place in quiet harmony for the time of being there: what travel is really for."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
