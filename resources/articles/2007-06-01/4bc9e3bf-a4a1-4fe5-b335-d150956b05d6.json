Hatton, one of Manchester City's most high-profile supporters, will have one belt borne aloft by the Manchester United footballer Wayne Rooney, while the other is to be taken by the Mexican boxing legend Marco Antonio Barrera. \"And what's all that about?\" the old comedian may well have asked, if slightly more colourfully, but Hatton would have the answer. Almost unbelievably relaxed for one so close to such a high-profile contest, Hatton batted away every question that came his way with the consummate ease and panache of a veteran nightclub entertainer as he faced the media. But first he admitted a sense of sadness of Manning's death, saying: \"People said a lot about him, but he wasn't what people thought. Bernard did an unbelievable amount for a silly number of charities. He raised thousands and thousands and he used to ring me up just about every week for a chat to see how I was getting on.\" Hatton added with a chuckle: \"Not too long back, I had Bernard speak at one of my shit T-shirt parties at the pub where me and my friends go. Tommy Docherty spoke as well, and we had a couple of strippers. It was a real classy do! But Bernard was great fun and I'll miss him.\" Rooney and his girlfriend, Coleen McLoughlin, are two of some 8,000 fans making the transatlantic journey. They include other footballers such as Joe Cole, Stewart Downing and Joey Barton along with Rooney's team-mates Rio Ferdinand, Wes Brown, John O'Shea and Michael Carrick. \"My dad can't believe it,\" Hatton said. \"We've got celebs like Robbie Williams and John Travolta coming in.\" Perhaps it is Hatton's lack of conceit that attracts his peers. \"I think they like me 'cos of how I am. I'm not a showbiz man. I'm just a Jack-the-lad who likes a laugh and a pint. I get paranoid people might think I'm losing touch with my roots. But not me. Not on your Nellie.\" Certainly his attitude seems to have struck a chord with Rooney who, despite his fame, is protected both by his club and agents to the extent that the real personality of this massively wealthy and successful man remains relatively unknown. \"I've known Wayne for a few years. When we met, we just hit it off. We have the same sense of humour and we love to talk boxing. I like to keep my feet on the ground and so does he. On Saturday night, if I win, I wouldn't dream of having a bouncer with me, and he doesn't like a posse with him. \"I'll have Wayne in the dressing room with me. A few people on Manchester City websites have criticised me for that. But they shouldn't give a shit about who's carrying the belt. They should just look at his face when Blue Moon [the Manchester City anthem adopted by Hatton] strikes up and everyone's singing. Listen, nobody hates Man United more than me, but Wayne's a mate. \"Recently Coleen had a birthday party, which I really fancied going to. But I was speaking at a sportsmen's dinner in Bournemouth. So I hired a private jet to Liverpool, and made my way to The Wirral where they live so I could be there. Wayne said to me, 'You really did that? Not many would have done that.' And that was when I asked him to carry my belt.\" Hatton's admiration of Barrera is longstanding, and the feeling is mutual. \"I have carried his belt, but I said he shouldn't feel obliged to do the same for me if he didn't want to alienate the Mexican fans. But he said, 'No, no, you're my brother. Castillo isn't.'\" Hatton looks in magnificent physical condition compared with six months ago when he struggled to shrug off a flu virus before an uninspiring points win against Juan Urango on his Las Vegas debut. He was in no doubt about his form going into this fight. \"Do I have the edge in footwork? Yes. In speed? Yes. Angles? Yes. Flair and boxing ability? Yes. Strength? Yes. I'm better than him in every department - not by a lot, but I am. I feel like a footballer who has been through a goal drought. I've not been at my best, but I have kept on winning. Now I have had my best training camp since when I fought Kostya Tszyu two years ago, and I know I can put on one of my greatest performances to really show America what I can do.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
