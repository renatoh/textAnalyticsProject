Bradley tweeted on Monday that Corbyn had \u201csold British secrets to communist spies\u201d. The Conservative MP for Mansfield\u2019s account has more than 4,000 followers. Earlier, a spokesman for Corbyn, who has been subject to days of headlines after it was claimed he met a Czech spy as a backbench MP, said his lawyers would be demanding the tweet be withdrawn or Bradley would face further legal action. \u201cJeremy instructed solicitors to contact Ben Bradley to delete his libellous tweet or face legal action,\u201d his spokesman said. Former Czech intelligence officer Jan Sarkocy told newspapers in recent days that he met Corbyn and recruited him as an intelligence asset, which Labour has called a \u201cridiculous smear\u201d. The suggestion that Corbyn was a paid agent has been denied by the director of the Czech security service archive, Svetlana Ptacnikova, who told the BBC their files suggested Corbyn was seen as a potential contact but he was not catalogued as an informant. \u201cMr Corbyn was not a secret collaborator working for the Czechoslovak intelligence service,\u201d she said. \u201cHe stayed in that basic category \u2013 and in fact he\u2019s still described as that, as a person of interest, in the final report issued by the StB agent shortly before he [the agent] was expelled from the UK.\u201d Labour has said: \u201c[Corbyn] neither has nor offered any privileged information to this or any other diplomat. The former Czechoslovak agent Jan Sarkocy\u2019s account of his meeting with Jeremy was false 30 years ago, is false now and has no credibility whatsoever.\u201d Earlier, Theresa May also addressed the allegations about Corbyn and Czech intelligence. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s for individual members of parliament to be accountable for their actions in the past. Where there are allegations of this sort, members of parliament should be prepared to be open and transparent.\u201d Bradley, who won his Mansfield seat from Labour at the June general election, was appointed the Conservatives\u2019 vice-chair in charge of youth engagement during the reshuffle in January and was forced to apologise after blogs were unearthed in which he suggested unemployed people should be given free vasectomies rather than continuing to have children they could not afford to support."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
