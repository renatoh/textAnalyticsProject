Tate Publishing \u00a319.99, pp360 Dali and Film edited by Matthew Gale. Tate Publishing \u00a335/\u00a324.99 pbk, pp224 Behind his bug-eyes and spit-whittled moustache, behind the wobbly watches and crucified Christs that pogo into the outer space of some of the most iconic images of the 20th century, the Salvador Dali one meets sniggering down the corridors of art history is a puerile pervert whose ability to generate undeserved fascination in the convoluted workings of his misanthropic mind continues to astonish nearly two decades after his death. In a year that sees the centenary of excellent Surrealist artists worthy of our ongoing attention (such as Frida Kahlo), the vision of the crass charlatan from Catalonia is once again on lavish display - this time in the context of his high-profile, if trifling, contribution to cinema. What is it that people endlessly warm to in a man who once suggested that the deepest way to demonstrate one's love for another is to eat their excrement? For Dali, such vulgarity was not an occasional slip of a sleazy tongue, but a job description. This is an artist who said he enjoyed hearing of transport disasters, who openly applauded Franco's fascism and frequently congratulated the dictator on his political tortures and assassinations, who once chortled that 'sometimes I spit on the portrait of my mother for the sheer pleasure of it'. Dali's shameless self-promotion is notorious and his cynical signing and selling off of thousands of blank sheets to a public he openly despised is only made more tiresome by the perennial whitewashing of his imagination by critics who are prepared to collude in peddling its over-egged achievement. To use the word 'hagiographic' to describe the sensibility behind Salvador Dali: An Illustrated Life is to waste too elevated a word on too unsaintly a project. Search the volume for any balanced treatment of the artist's fascist tendencies, which earned Dali's expulsion from the Surrealist school of Andre Breton, and all you'll find are implications that his peers were merely envious of Dali's accelerating fame. Even innocuous anecdotes that could cast Dali in a negative light have been expunged, such as the time he buffoonishly appeared to deliver a lecture in a diving suit so that he could 'descend', he said, 'into the subconscious'. When the airtight helmet began to suffocate the egregious ego, his wife scurried on stage and desperately attempted to hammer a billiard cue through the suit's heavy casing while the London audience fell about the auditorium in convulsions of laughter. This can only have aggravated Dal\u00ed's contempt for the eye of the ordinary observer of the artist and his work - a theme that dominates his contributions to films. The gratuitous slashing of eyes is evident from his first foray into film-making, the 17-minute Un chien andalou, which he created in 1929 with Luis Bunuel. It opens with a toe-curling razor scene in which a woman's retina is graphically ripped apart, a motif Dali returns to in the famous dream sequence that he was commissioned to create 16 years later for Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbound, in which a pair of enormous scissors snip through a curtain of silk-screened pupils. Despite the disdain that they demonstrate for the audience, these sequences continue to intrigue, generating a cache of new essays reassessing Dali's relationship not only with Bunuel and Hitchcock, but with the film-maker whom Dali himself regarded as the greatest living Surrealist artist, Walt Disney. Dali and Film is the first full-length evaluation of Dali's efforts to make his mark on cinema, many of which were never realised, or were left on the cutting-room floor. But whatever one thinks of Dali's actual achievement as a cultural lens through which the artistic pretensions of 20th-century film-making can be brought into focus, he provides the perfect aperture for some wonderful essays in this beautifully produced book. Several of the articles here attempt to measure Dali's vision against the Freudian concepts that were beginning to gain popular currency in the Thirties and Forties. Dali himself endeavoured to elevate the psychic value of his work by insisting that his canvases offered unflinching photographs of the subconscious. By doing so, he hoped to capitalise on an emerging instinct that anything that purported to issue from the unconscious was necessarily profound, and potentially linked to fundamental truths. But not all muddy waters are deep. Smeared with silly Tandoori tigers squeezing from phallic piranhas, masturbating amoebae and soulless desertscapes whose every disjointed detail bleeds into another ghastly portrait of the artist's homely wife, Gala, Dali's paintings are little more than self-regarding Rorschach tests - not so much glimpses of a collective unconscious as stool samples of a single-soiled soul. But it wasn't always so psychologically sordid. Dali was a virtuoso draughtsman and his early efforts to forge a new visual language from the vogue vocabulary of Cubism and Dadaism caught the attention in the Twenties of Pablo Picasso, whom Dali adored, and fellow Catalan Joan Miro, whose penchant for painting what looked like frat parties in a petri dish would have a lifelong impact on the young artist. The climax of this first phase is the genuinely mesmerising The Persistence of Memory (1931), in which a trinity of stopwatches - each frozen on a different hour as if summoned from far-flung dimensions - melt over broken branches on some eternal shore where a sleeping face, like a wave-worn seashell, has run aground. Some suggest that the contorted visage is a surreal self-portrait and indeed it is fair to say, at least artistically, that at the age of 27, Dali was already washed up. Victim of his own precocious success, Dali believed the hyperventilating hype and took the enormous interest that these early paintings generated as validation not of the artistic promise that they held, but of the unwholesome neuroses from which he claimed they sprang. Rather than allowing his deviance to disturb from below the surface of his art, the energy of his ego flowed in the opposite direction - his paintings became merely easels for showcasing what he came to regard as the real masterpiece - his egregious genius. The result is decades of atrophied talent in direct disproportion to an insufferable arrogance. Only in the arresting perspective of the 1951 masterwork, Christ of St John of the Cross, in which the observer's eye is elevated into omniscience above a celestially suspended crucifix, does a spark of promise briefly reignite. In later life, desperate for regard, as his wilting ape-hanger moustache began to look more and more slapstick, Dali became a gibbering caricature, referring to himself in the third person, unable to paint or to keep the charade of his empty achievement going. As fond of inane enunciations as he was of flabby, fatuous art, he once remarked that the best way to experience cinema was with one's eyes closed. Some may feel the same is true about many of Salvador Dali's paintings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
