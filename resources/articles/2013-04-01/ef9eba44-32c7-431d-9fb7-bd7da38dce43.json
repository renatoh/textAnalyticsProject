At stake is a place in the World Group play-offs in September. In the night match Great Britain's James Ward turned a stroll into a struggle, saving three match points before Evgeny Donskoy eked out a 4-6, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 8-6 win in three hours and 45 minutes to give the Russians a 2-0 lead. Ward, out for six months last year with a wrist injury, had a wobble that started when he surrendered a 2-0 lead in the third set in sight of victory, and self-doubt gripped him again in the fourth. He never quite recovered his early composure, although he fought to the final point. Inevitably, though, the author of the script on day one was Evans, who grew up nearby and had a fair smattering of friends and family in the audience of 2,700 in the packed hall at Coventry's Ricoh Arena. A year ago he made a significant breakthrough with two stirring victories in this competition but a reluctance to travel and a rebellious streak have hindered his development. \"There's other things in life, isn't there?\" he said. \"I'm from a pretty working-class background, always been down the squash and tennis club, got a big group of friends \u2013 and not all of them are coming to the Davis Cup at weekends to play. It's up to me, it's not up to anyone else. If people are saying that [he is wasting his talent], then I'm the idiot who goes along with it. \"It's not that I don't want to do it. It's just for whatever reasons, distractions \u2026 It's easier said than done. Thousands of people have told me but I'm yet to do it for a sustained period of time. I definitely think I will be top 100. I've been working pretty hard from the start of the year, so hopefully this year I'll push on and you never know what can happen. A week in tennis can change your life.\" Whatever the self-mocking tone of Evans's confession, it nevertheless took Tursunov, ranked 67 in the world, three hours, 56 minutes and a blizzard of aces to beat a 22-year-old opponent stuck at 325 in the rankings despite his many gifts. Tursunov has seen it all himself: the early days of promise, the injuries, the struggle and various levels of rehabilitation. But the 30-year-old Russian will not have come up against many players as perplexing as Evans, who pushed him to the concluding ace with some virtuoso shot-making. His coach, Leon Smith, ignoring the doubters, selected him at the last minute ahead of the more experienced Jamie Baker and was pleased with the performance but as frustrated as Evans was with the result. \"At the start I didn't return that well,\" Evans said. \"Then I had a good patch in the middle. And he did pretty well to serve it out with four bombs at the end.\" It was a match of glorious swoops and dives, Evans trusting his talent to recover time and again in tight spots, his one-handed backhand, rich in backspin, a consistent delight. He did not often choose the safe option and Tursunov said he had to be constantly vigilant. This is a decent but hardly imposing Russian selection and Colin Fleming (ranked 28 in the discipline) and the Olympic gold medallist Jonathan Marray (16) will start firm favourites in the doubles today against Igor Kunitsyn (439) and Victor Baluda (440). As for the reverse singles on Sunday, Friday's performances suggest the tightest of finishes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
