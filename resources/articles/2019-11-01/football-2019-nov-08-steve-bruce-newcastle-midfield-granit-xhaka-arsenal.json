The former England midfielder has found himself dropped in recent weeks, watching from the sidelines as the Longstaff brothers, Sean and Matty, captured the headlines but Sean\u2019s suspension has reopened the first-team door. With Matty rested Shelvey returned to the first XI alongside Isaac Hayden at West Ham last week, impressing in Newcastle\u2019s 3-2 win. \u201cThe emergence of Matty has given Jonjo the kick up the backside he needed,\u201d said Bruce. \u201cHe set the standard at West Ham and hopefully he\u2019ll repeat that against Bournemouth. He responded in the right way to being left out and trained in the right way.\u201d In mitigation a playmaker who is perhaps not ideally suited to Newcastle\u2019s low possession game began the season carrying a thigh injury. \u201cI honestly believe Jonjo was not fully fit,\u201d said Bruce. \u201cHis physical stats from West Ham were massively improved so, physically, he can do it. There is this perception he can\u2019t do the distances but he can. \u201cWe all know he\u2019s a good footballer but we are without the ball for the majority of time and Jonjo has to understand he has to do his part out of possession. He did it terrifically well at West Ham but I put him in the team for what he can do on the ball; he\u2019s good for set-piece delivery and can pick a pass. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a different Jonjo in training in the past couple of weeks. Maybe it was responding to Matty in the right way but he looked fit and healthy and I hope he\u2019s finally playing without pain. The rest probably did him the world of good.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
