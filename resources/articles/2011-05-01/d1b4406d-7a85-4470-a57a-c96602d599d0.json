I can empathise with Alex McLeish, Ian Holloway, Steve Kean, Mick McCarthy and Roberto Mart\u00ednez. Three of them will end evening ecstatic, just as I was on the last day in 1982-83 when my Luton Town side won at Manchester City. For two the experience will be devastating. Looking back, that stupid, dervish dance I did across the turf at Maine Road 28 years ago was born of relief. We'd worked so hard to reach the top division, so to have gone down after one season would have been shattering. There is no greater pressure in the game than knowing all you have strived for may be lost. As a manager you have to maintain a clear head and coax the best from your players, when anxiety is gripping all around. It is the ultimate test. With Luton, a bit like Birmingham City, we had never envisaged being under threat. We felt clear of trouble only to lose our last home game of the season 5-1 to Everton on the penultimate weekend, with a few of the other sides down there achieving unexpected results. From nowhere we were sucked right into the scrap. We had Manchester United on the following Monday at Old Trafford, a game we lost 3-0, which meant we knew what we had to do: win at City on the final day to stay in the division at our hosts' expense. Twenty-four hours after the United loss we went to Watford to play in Ross Jenkins's testimonial \u2013 an opportunity to give one or two injury doubts some brief game time \u2013 but preparations for Maine Road had begun before that friendly. Our ploy was to break the players down early in the week, then systematically build them back up again. We told them they'd got us in this mess, letting themselves and the supporters down. It was a stick-and-carrot exercise and we then spent the next few days gently reminding them of their qualities, instilling belief. It's important to have a good captain, someone you trust and who can offer you an insight into how the squad are feeling: if certain players are defeatist or defiant. I spoke at length with my captain, Brian Horton, and his thoughts helped shape my selection. On the Thursday before the match we visited a health farm and tried to relax the lads. You must get away from the pressure if you can. We did Pilates \u2013 something different \u2013 to lift the mood. Otherwise it's all too intense and the stage fright can grip. I had a family bereavement on the day before the match \u2013 no one outside the club is aware of any private problems that the players or staff might be going through prior to such a huge game. As a manager you need to read the players' minds. The focus has to be right with everyone. Like Wigan, Birmingham, Blackburn and Blackpool, we were away for our game. We stayed up at Tillington Hall, outside Stafford, well away from Maine Road. You need to be in a bubble, not in among the fans of the club you're going to be playing. Less risk of fire alarms disturbing you overnight. If we'd stayed in Manchester, we would have been the enemy. Instead, as you drive to the ground on the day of the game, you see your club's supporters arriving as well and it makes you feel as if you're an army en route to battle. You have allies. That is reassuring. I remember the coach journey \u2013 we had Lionel Richie playing on the music system in the bus, though I forget the song \u2013 as awfully tense. The ground felt full from 2pm and the chairman, Denis Mortimer, came down to the dressing room pre-match to wish the players luck. I'm against that. They don't need reminding what's riding on the occasion and, if the chairman doesn't appear all season then turns up on the final afternoon, it exaggerates the point. You have to relax the team, not worry them. My pre-match speech was calm and collected. Ranting just over-hypes people. You want to get your message across, offer the team clarity and motivation. All you want to see is the players get hold of the ball early and try and impose themselves. We'd encourage Paul Walsh to put his foot on the ball and scratch his nose, make the game stand still. \"They can't touch you,\" I told him. \"Show you're in command.\" It's about settling into the game. Do that and you send a message to the opposition. You weather the first 20 minutes away from home, praying that the referee is not swayed by the atmosphere, then get them in at the break and, again, don't over\u2011analyse. You need to get the players' attention and make them look forward to the second half, not back at any errors they may have committed in the first period. You make two or three points, no more. They can't absorb anything else with the anxiety levels generated by the occasion. Be clinical and don't overload information. We were still goalless at that stage but you need to be alert yourself during the later stages and spot where you can influence the match with a substitution or a tactical tweak. As it was, it was our substitute, Raddy Antic, who scored the game's only goal at Maine Road with five minutes of the match remaining. The outpouring of emotion when you know that is it, the game is won, the season saved ... well, it does not get any better. The adrenaline can take over then, but only then. Up to that point the manager has to be as cold, calm and collected as is possible, even if he is going through torment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
