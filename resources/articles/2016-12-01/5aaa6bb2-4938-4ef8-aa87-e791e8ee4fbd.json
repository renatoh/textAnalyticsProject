Well, not immediately but he did after 30 minutes of the first half when his Everton players started to do everything he wanted them to. His midfield were sharp in the tackle, his forwards were motivated and had movement and his defence was resolute in the face of huge pressure late in that game. The one downside to that fine victory is that Jagielka is now suspended for the Merseyside derby. As for Arsenal, they struggled a bit phjysically. Coquelin and Xhaka didn\u2019t boss midfield as McCarthy and Gueye stamped their authority on the game and therefore the supply lines to Ozil and Sanchez were not as good as they could have been. That said, they could, and probably should, have scored in the final minute of stoppage time as they hammed on the door. That would have made me look good for my prediction too. A good night for the blues then, Everton and Chelsea. Thanks for your emails. Goodnight. And one final email: \u201cI thought modern football was spinning out of financial control,\u201d writes Peter Oh. \u201cBased on your readers\u2019 scorching missives, it\u2019s nothing compared to what has happened to modern firefighting.\u201d Take a deep breath. It\u2019s over. 90+4 min: Somehow Everton don\u2019t concede as Arsenal ping about four shots at goal that culminate in Baines clearing off the line, Lukaku racing clear and setting Barkley up, badly, when he could have scored. The reason? Cech was still galloping back. What a finish to a frantic, wonderful game \u2026 90+3 min: The corner is cleared and Jagielka is sent off for a second yellow card as he pulls back Perez. 90+2 min: Xhaka floats a ball towards Monreal at the back post. Coleman leaps and heads clear for a corner. Cech\u2019s up for this one. 90 min: There\u2019ll be four minutes added time. Barkley clatters a shot at Cech when all he had to do was square the ball to Mirallas for a tap-in. Everton win a corner and take it short in the hope they can waste time. They do keep possession. Can they see this out? 89 min: McCarthy is replaced by Funes Mori. He\u2019s won the midfield battle with Xhaka. His furious tackling at the end of the first half helped swing this game the way of Everton too. 88 min: What a din at Goodison. The fans almost fall silent though as Sanchez drifts a ball in towards Giroud\u2019s head but it\u2019s inches away and Stekelenburg clasps the ball gratefully. 87 min: Arsenal\u2019s marking was poor there but Williams and Everton won\u2019t give a flying one. Maybe he was Xhaka\u2019s man. Maybe he wasn\u2019t. Could Koeman salvage another season with a win against Arsenal. What a moment for Williams. Barkley plays a brilliant ball into the box, Williams steams in and fires a header low into the net. Goodison erupts. It\u2019s his first goal for the club. What a goal. How important that could be for Everton\u2019s season. 84 min: Lukaku is fouled by Koscielny (they\u2019ve had a fine battle tonight). Baines whips the free-kick into the box where a header is pinged down into an Arsenal player. Moments later Jagielka forces a fine stop from Cech. Corner \u2026 82 min: Gueye turns beautifully to send his marker the wrong way and then plays a delicious little one-two before trying to feed the ball through to Lukaku, only to see his pass dink off an Arsenal defender and roll through to Cech. That was fleet-footed brilliance by the Everton midfielder. 80 min: Lukaku holds the ball up well and finds Coleman, on the gallop, on the right. He throws a few shapes before drifting in a left-footed cross that is cleared comfortably. The pace has dipped just a little. Not by much though. 78 min: What a show of faith in Dominic Calvert Lewin this is by Koeman. The 19-year-old, signed from Sheffield United for \u00a31.5m, makes his debut. He replaces Enner Valencia, who gets a rousing round of applause for his hard work tonight. A teenager coming on against Arsenal with the score 1-1? Hmmm. 77 min: Allen Matthew Turner writes: \u201cIn response to Ali Robertson, if your uncle was making \u00a335,000 a year, only put out one fire in 50 years and it took him three hours then he was actually making \u00a3583,333.33 per hour. Also, he wasn\u2019t a fireman.\u201d 75 min: Sanchez gets free in the inside-left channel again. His ball inside is at an awkward height for Iwobi, though, who can\u2019t get his body under control as he prods a shot just wide. 73 min: Everton have their juices up. Lukaku wallops a shot at Monreal. Then Barkley whips in a wonderful ball that hits Koscielny and stops dead a couple of feet from the goal-line. Lukaku tries to get to it but as he gets his body in front of Koscielny, Iwobi pokes the ball away. Coleman plays a fine ball in moments later that is oh so close to finding its way through to Lukaku. This is much better from Everton 70 min: Oxlade Chamberlain is off and Iwobi is on for Arsenal. And Walcott too. He\u2019s replaced by Giroud. 69 min: Sometimes there is no finer sight in football than a big man running really, really fast. Lukaku was that glorious sight just then, knocking the ball past Gabriel and racing after it in thrilling style only to slice his shot into the side-netting. 67 min: Mirallas replaces Lennon, who has had a quiet second half. \u201cOn TV they just showed Chris Waddle announcing the game,\u201d writes JR in Illinois. \u201cThe headset he is wearing is gigantic. He is almost literally all just ... headphones.\u201d Maybe he is hard of hearing and needs massive cans JR. He\u2019s no spring chicken these days. 64 min: Sanchez is released into the box, where he poses a rare old threat. He shimmies to the byline and drills a cross in that Williams blocks. Then Monreal picks up the rebound and fizzes a cross over \u2026 everyone. Arsenal come back again. Everton are on the ropes \u2026 but they survive. There is a cracking pace to this game. 63 min: Valencia, who has got himself into good positions all night, whips a low cross in towards Lukaku only to see it bounce off Koscielny and into Cech\u2019s arms. That could, very easily, have been an own goal had the ricochet been a bit crueler. 62 min: The game is swinging back in Everton\u2019s favour. They\u2019re playing with vim and vigour once more. Here\u2019s Ali Robertson: \u201cI had an uncle that was an underemployed fireman for 50 years at, I guess, around 35k a year. He only had to put out one fire, that took him about 3 hours. Was he paid almost \u00a310,000 per hour? Charles Antaki thinks so.\u201d 60 min: Barkley finds space behind Coquelin and fizzes a left-footed shot just wide from 20 yards. Then Coquelin\u2019s studs find Gueye\u2019s shin and the Arsenal midfielder would appear to be lucky to avoid a yellow card. He\u2019s had a few nibbles tonight. 57 min: Some brave goalkeeping by Stekelenburg stops Ozil from nipping in to get a free shot on goal. Bellerin had slipped the German in on goal but the Everton keeper rushed out and took a whack off Baines as he gathered the ball. I think his baubles took the brunt of Baines\u2019s studs. Ooyah! Some deep breaths later and he\u2019s up and at it again. 55 min: Everton break and Baines is tripped by Coquelin 20 yards from goal. Barkley stands over it \u2026 but his curled effort on goal is blocked by the wall. 53 min: Suddenly Arsenal are bringing the gegen \u2026 pressing Everton into a corner and forcing Coleman into a hurried clearance. Arsenal come back, Oxlade-Chamberlain slipping Sanchez in down the left wing. The Chilean pulls the ball back to Ozil who, completely unmarked, uncharacteristically curls the ball over from 12 yards when the net was gaping and Ozil was well positioned. Well, it happens. 52 min: Giroud and Iwobi are warming up for Arsenal. Here\u2019s a lovely interview with the Arsenal youngster. 50 min: Dink, dink, dink, dink, dink. Arsenal are dominating possession but Everton are holding them back. But there is a feeling that if there is too much more of this ball-hogging from Arsenal, they will find a way through. 49 min: A warning sign for Everton. Sanchez, Walcott and Ozil play three of the simplest one-touch passes you will ever see and create a crossing opportunity for Sanchez. One that Walcott can\u2019t take, as he heads over. How Giroud would have loved that. 47 min: Bellerin dinks a lovely little ball forwards to Coquelin, who returns the favour. But Baines stops Bellerin in his tracks and Everton clear. And now Charles Antaki brings the maths: \u201cErm, here goes: \u00a3400,000 a week, say for one game, played over 90 minutes, \u00a3400,000 / 90 \u2026. (wrestles with pen and paper, gives up, uses trusty computer calculator, though not confidently)\u2026 yes, \u00a34,400 a minute. Ah no, that\u2019s with rounding.. \u00a34,444! My final offer.\u201d 45 min: Peep! And off we go again. Lukaku, not a man known for his pressing, puts Cech under pressure and forces him to wallop the ball clear. That\u2019s a sign that Everton will begin where they left off. Right, well Everton looked a completely different team when Koeman flared his nostrils and his team responded and pressed Arsenal. That said, they will need to create a great deal of chances to win this game as they feel Arsenal might only need three to score one or two goals. Everton made need 10. Keep your eye on tempers spiralling out of control in this second half too. McCarthy needs to keep his lid under control. Everton can\u2019t afford a sending off. And how is this new Arsenal spine? Can it withstand a furious second half in the stormy north-west? A place that has done for previous title challenges? We\u2019ll see. An email: \u201cCan we have the maths of Charles Antaki regarding Sanchez?\u201d demands Yoann Lechenault. \u201cBecause I think he didn\u2019t switch off just his moral scruples.\u201d That was great. And my prediction of 2-2 is still alive. 45 min: Everton must wish the half could carry on. They look affronted as the half-time whistle goes. Then there is a load of pushing and shoving between the two teams as they try to get down the tunnel. This has been highly entertaining. And there\u2019s that missing quality. Gueye finds Baines out on the left. He sends Walcott for a copy of the Echo with a little swivel of the hips, and then whips in a beautiful ball with his right foot for Coleman to glance into the far corner. A deserved equaliser. Everton had already found their mojo, they just needed that moment of quality. 42 min: There\u2019s a pulsating tempo in this game now. Barkley shows lovely feet to skip inside Bellerin and then wallops a crossfield pass over to Lukaku. He controls the ball and then slows play down unnecessarily. The result is a cross into the box that is cleared by Koscielny. Then McCarthy clatters into Coquelin and is booked for his trouble. 38 min: Barkley fizzes it in, it bounces up at Monreal, who makes a pig\u2019s ear of it, and then lands at Lennon\u2019s feet. Feet that he can\u2019t reorder in time to get a decent shot away. The result is an effort that drifts over the bar. It wasn\u2019t an easy chance, though. Then Arsenal break and win a corner at the other end as Sanchez tries to find one of many Arsenal players who threatened to outnumber Everton in their own box. 36 min: Everton are on top now and creating by far the better chances. Meanwhile: \u201cNot sure if playing \u2018Story of the blues\u2019 will go down well with the blue contingent on Merseyside,\u201d writes Lee Taylor. \u201cWylie is a big red and delights in having \u2018Heart as big as Liverpool\u2019 (parodied by Julian Cope as Liver big as Hartlepool\u2019) at Anfield. There you go.\u201d Don\u2019t grass me up Lee. Everton win a free-kick over on the right in Arsenal\u2019s half. Barkley to whip it in. 34 min: Barkley dinks a delicious ball over the Arsenal defence that is just an inch too far in front of Valencia, who was racing into the box to get on the end of it. Then Lukaku shifts the ball past Gabriel and clatters a shot into the Park End. He hurried that. Needed a little more zen in his boots there. 31 min: Barkley and McCarthy clatter into a couple of tackles and get the crowd off their feet and behind the team. Lennon is released on the left. He zips into the box but slices wide. That\u2019s better from Everton. Arsenal aren\u2019t doing much. Everton might just be sensing that now. 27 min: Everton win a corner after some good interplay by Valencia and Coleman on the right. The Irishman\u2019s cross hits the first man, though, and Everton have a corner. Barkley whips it in, Valencia leaps, but heads over. This is one of those games when the most-maligned player on the pitch seems to be getting all of the ball. You might call it Moussa Sissoko-syndrome. 26 min: \u201cWhat was the figure that that Chinese club was willing to pay S\u00e1nchez - \u00a3400,000 a week?\u201d writes Charles Antaki, answering his own question. \u201cSo by my maths that\u2019s \u00a34,400 a minute. Seems worth it, if you switch off your moral scruples for a while.\u201d 24 min: Baines gets Everton motoring up the left wing before switching play to the right. Valencia has the chance to play in Coleman, which he ignores and instead clatters the ball off a yellow shirt. And then he has the chance to play in Barkley, which he ignores, only for the move to break down. A bit of quality and Everton are working the opportunities to cause Arsenal problems. Yup, quality. It\u2019s been hopelessly absent here. 23 min: \u201cSouthern Rail barely reach Southampton,\u201d writes Tim Hall in response to Raymond Reardon. \u201cBit like Ron and Everton really.\u201d Honk. 22 min: Well Everton have done absolutely nothing to get the home fans onside. There are howls of derision as Coleman hoiks the ball out of play instead of drifting a ball down the line towards Valencia. Arsenal lead without having got out of second gear. Sanchez fires a low shot towards the corner that Stekelenburg has covered but (and it\u2019s a big but) it clatters off Williams, who has had an awful few minutes, and into the centre of the goal where the keeper can only get a despairing fingertip to it. A deserved lead, despite the fortune on Sanchez\u2019s part. 17 min: Coquelin is fouled by Jagielka this far outside the penalty area. It followed some diabolical defending by Everton in which they had about 323 chances to clear the ball and took none of them. Among that slapstick defending Williams managed to stick his studs into Gueye\u2019s knee (by accident, I might add). Williams is a heavy lad. Gueye isn\u2019t. He\u2019s hobbled off for treatment. What can Arsenal do with this free-kick. Ozil and Sanchez stand over it. 15 min: Ronald Koeman is trying to push his team up the pitch with his huge flapping arms. It\u2019s not working, mind. A one-two between Oxlade-Chamberlain (who has been bright so far) and Sanchez, almost releases the young Englishman in the Everton penalty area but again Williams steps in. 14 min: \u201cWith the wheels falling off Everton, after beginning like a train, seems to indicate that Ronald Koeman has brought his Southern Rail background from his previous environs to Goodison,\u201d begins Raymond Reardon. \u201cYou don\u2019t know whether they are going to turn up, or whether they are going to lay down tools, and whether their patronage are going to be left stranded.\u201d 12 min: Arsenal, perhaps having realised that they\u2019ve allowed Everton to gain a bit of confidence, go into possession mode, creating little triangles all over Goodison Park and frustrating the team in blue. Finally they release Monreal on the left, who slides in Oxlade-Chamberlain. His whipped-in cross is cleared well by Williams, though. 11 min: A better spell for Everton here. They\u2019re using their width to good effect. Valencia is finding space on the right; Lennon likewise on the left. The fans respond with some concerted noise. 8 min: Everton break and Valencia pokes the ball through to Lukaku in the inside-right channel. It\u2019s a dangerous moment for Arsenal. The Belgian has time to look up and pick out a team-mate in the box. But instead, he does everything in a hurry and whacks the ball off a defender and out for a corner. A corner that comes to nothing. 6 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain finds Monreal on the overlap. He drags the ball back to Ozil, 12 yards from goal, but the cool Arsenal forward is leaning back to reach the ball and sends it well over. 5 min: Barkley, under intense pressure, does well to keep possession in his own half and finds a pass out wide to relieve the pressure but Everton are struggling to get out of their own half. The groans from the home fans suggest this isn\u2019t the start they were hoping for. 3 min: Everton win a corner after some good work from Gueye. Barkley races over to take it. It\u2019s drilled/mishit (delete as appropriate) low into the box and flicked out for a goal-kick by Lukaku. 2 min: McCarthy has a nibble at Xhaka straight away as if to prove a point to Koeman, who asked for a bit of the devil in his players tonight. But moments later, Barkley plays a dire pass back to Baines that Sanchez nicks. He races past Baines and tries to thread the ball through to Ozil but his pass is just overhit. Sanchez\u2019s batteries are fully charged. Look out Everton. 1 min: Peep! Everton are shooting from right to left on my telly. Arsenal, in yellow (why?), the other way. The theme tune from Z-Cars dances through the evening air. Which means one thing: here come the two teams. It\u2019s red v blue beneath the floodlights. I have high hopes for this \u2026 There was a time when Everton had title hopes when these two teams met at Goodison Park. That time was 1985. And those title hopes were realised. Will Arsenal realise theirs this season? You\u2019ve probably already seen this stat but here it is again anyway \u2026 Is Tony Adams wearing Asics boots in the accompanying picture? I think he is you know. Do Mitre still make football boots? If not, they should do. Goodison Park has a new sign that just says Goodison on it. It\u2019s simple and very effective. A similarly simple, effective approach tonight would be very welcome for Evertonians. Looking at the Everton XI, it has enough about it to do this. The midfield battle will be key. I expect McCarthy and Gueye will have to work their socks off to upset Arsenal\u2019s rhythm. Ronald Koeman speaks: \u201cI think it\u2019s really important that we are a really good compact team tonight and in that way in my opinion this is the best XI to start. Gareth Barry is no longer the youngest player and we have a tough period coming up so he is rested.\u201d Ars\u00e8ne Wenger also says a few things really quietly. From what I could tell he seemed to be saying that he has no qualms about Gabriel coming in to replace Shkodran Mustafi. A musical interlude: Story of the Blues. So no real surprises in the Arsenal starting XI but Ronald Koeman shuffles his pack, bringing back Enner Valencia, Phil Jagielka and Ross Barkley, whose job it will be to try to create for Lukaku. Valencia is often criticised but he may give Lukaku a bit more freedom just by being up there with him. Gareth Barry is rested, in case you\u2019re wondering where he is. Everton: Stekelenburg, Coleman, Jagielka, Ashley Williams, Baines, McCarthy, Gueye, Barkley, Lennon, Lukaku, Valencia. Subs: Robles, Deulofeu, Mirallas, Cleverley, Funes Mori, Calvert-Lewin, Holgate. Arsenal: Cech, Bellerin, Gabriel, Koscielny, Monreal, Coquelin, Xhaka, Walcott, Ozil, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Sanchez. Subs: Gibbs, Lucas Perez, Giroud, Ospina, Holding, Iwobi, Elneny. Referee: Mark Clattenburg (Tyne &amp; Wear) Evening. Having gone off like a train at the beginning of the season Everton\u2019s wheels have come off in spectacular style in the past couple of months. Look, there they are rolling off down County Road. Be a good lad, Ross, and fetch them will you? One win in 10 games is relegation form. Ronald Koeman appears to know what is going wrong but hasn\u2019t found the right tools to fix it yet and, as Christmas approaches, frustrated Evertonians aren\u2019t in the mood to extend goodwill to all men, least of all those underperforming in royal blue. So Arsenal, who haven\u2019t lost in 14 games, aren\u2019t the ideal visitors. But, and here\u2019s the thing, Koeman was on a similarly dreadful run at Southampton this time last year and turned it around with an incredibly savvy 4-0 home performance against \u2026 Arsenal. Now, I know he has a different team with a different set of problems to overcome at Everton, but he exudes authority and appears to be a methodical and calm problem solver. He just needs time \u2013 that most precious of commodities that seems so difficult to squeeze out of jumpy chairmen, fans and preposterous pundits and commentators these days. Koeman hasn\u2019t been helped by a long-term injury to Yannick Bolasie either, the one player capable of creating something from nothing when his team-mates were running down blind alleys. Whether an Everton recovery starts tonight might well depend on how much support Romelu Lukaku is given in attack and whether Koeman can give his players an injection of much-needed belief. Arsenal need no such confidence-boosting pep talk. They\u2019re in fine form and playing some wonderful attacking football, winning games thanks to the velvet brilliance of Mesut Ozil and the lethal industry of Alexis Sanch\u00e9z. Arsenal should win this game comfortably and, if they do, they may go top. But I just feel it might not be that easy for them tonight. Everton are unbeaten in the league at their grand old ground. The one good thing they can still cling to won\u2019t be given up without a fight. My prediction: Everton 2-2 Arsenal"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
