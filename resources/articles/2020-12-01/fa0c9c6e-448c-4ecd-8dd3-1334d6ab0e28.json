Sundar Pichai told Google employees in a Wednesday memo, obtained by Axios, that the tech company was beginning a review of the circumstances leading up to Timnit Gebru\u2019s exit last week, and how Google could have \u201cled a more respectful process\u201d. Gebru is a top scholar of AI ethics and one of the most prominent Black scientists in her field. She said she had been fired; Google has referred to it as a resignation. The dispute leading up to her departure concerned Google\u2019s efforts to disassociate itself from a research paper that Gebru had co-authored, which examined the societal dangers of an AI technology used by Google. The paper contended that technology companies could do more to ensure AI systems aimed at mimicking human writing and speech did not exacerbate historical gender biases and use of offensive language, according to a draft copy seen by Reuters. Gebru tweeted last week that she had been fired after sending an email to an internal group for women and allies working in the company\u2019s AI unit. Her email referenced the disputed research paper but more broadly expressed frustration at Google\u2019s diversity programs. In it, Gebru argued that \u201cthere is zero accountability\u201d or real incentive for Google leadership to change. Her departure has prompted widespread anger within the company. More than 1,200 Google employees signed a letter of protest last Friday, accusing Google of \u201cunprecedented research censorship\u201d, racism and defensiveness. Meanwhile, a separate letter posted to Medium on Monday saw Gebru\u2019s colleagues disputing the company\u2019s account that she resigned. \u201cDr Gebru did not resign, despite what Jeff Dean (Senior Vice President and head of Google Research), has publicly stated,\u201d the letter read. Pichai\u2019s note does not call it a firing or a resignation but says: \u201cWe need to accept responsibility for the fact that a prominent Black, female leader with immense talent left Google unhappily.\u201d Gebru criticized Pichai\u2019s memo on Wednesday on Twitter, saying she saw \u201cno plans for accountability\u201d in it and because it offered no apology for what happened to her."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
