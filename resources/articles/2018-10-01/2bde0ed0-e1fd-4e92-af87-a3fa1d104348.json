According to separate sources, Dr Nicole Montana, senior medical officer for Australia\u2019s health contractor, IHMS, was arrested on Tuesday night and ordered to leave. A spokeswoman for IHMS would not confirm the arrest but said Montana was stood down on Tuesday \u201cfor a breach of Regional Processing Centre rules\u201d. \u201cShe is departing Nauru today. A replacement senior medical officer is already in Nauru, there has been no impact on the services provided to transferees.\u201d It is not known why she was arrested or who gave the order. Montana had replaced Dr Christopher Jones, whose visa was suddenly cancelled by Nauru in September amid arguments over medical transfers. A spokesman for the Australian Department of Home Affairs declined to answer questions and said it was a matter for Nauru and IHMS. Professor Paul Colditz, President of the Paediatrics and Child Health Division within the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, said the situation on Nauru had reached \u201ccrisis point\u201d. \u201cLast week Medecins Sans Frontieres was forced to stop providing care on the island and yesterday evening the senior medical officer for Australia\u2019s health contractor, IHMS, was arrested and ordered to leave,\u201d he said. \u201cThe development overnight is further sign that the situation on Nauru is completely untenable and constitutes a medical crisis. The Australian Government must immediately bring the children and their families to Australia to receive the medical care they desperately and urgently need.\u201d Plan International Australia CEO Susanne Legena also called for refugees to be taken out of Nauru. \u201cIt is very concerning that at a time of extreme need for medical services for vulnerable refugees, medical personnel are being kicked off Nauru,\u201d said Legena. \u201cWe have seen the tragic consequences that have resulted from a lack of medical support on this remote Pacific island time and time again. The mental health and physical health of children is on the line \u2013 the Australian Government can no longer wash their hands of the consequences of its actions and declare this the responsibility of the Nauruan Government.\u201d Greens Senator Nick McKim said the prime minister had \u201clost control\u201d of the detention centres. \u201cThis deportation confirms that there is no way for Australia\u2019s prisoners on Nauru to receive proper medical support.\u201d The Nauruan government\u2019s behaviour has been increasingly unpredictable in recent weeks, including blocking medical transfers ordered by the federal court, and suddenly forcing M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, which was delivering psychological and psychiatric services, off the island. After MSF went public about the conditions in Nauru and the worsening health crisis, Nauru accused it of conspiring against the country. The Nauruan government has also targeted a group of people known as the Nauru 19, individuals including former ministers and a prime minister who were charged over a protest outside parliament. Their case was dismissed by a judge who strongly criticised the government\u2019s pursuit of the group. Members have said a blacklist \u2013 evidence of which was put before the court \u2013 continues to be used against them. At least three have had passport applications blocked, and this week one accused the government of denying critical medical treatment to a member of the group, Rutherford Jeremiah, after a diving accident. The Nauru government and police force have been contacted for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
