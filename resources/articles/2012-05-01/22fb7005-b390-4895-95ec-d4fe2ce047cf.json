The party said on Sunday that she was making the move \"in order to broaden opportunities for the range of talent in the party and to raise the profiles of others aspiring to election\". Lucas is to step down in September at the end of her second two-year term as leader, a period during which the party has made gains at local council level in addition to her own Westminster breakthrough in the constituency of Brighton Pavilion. \"We're lucky to have a wealth of capability and experience in our party,\" she said, adding that she would continue \"putting the Green case for change in parliament\". \"Now feels like the right time to step aside, to allow more of that ability to come forward and help the party to grow,\" she said in a statement on the party's website. \"I'm proud that during the four years of my term, we've moved Green politics forward to a higher level, with the party by far the most influential it has ever been.\" Originally an activist with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Lucas joined the Greens in 1986 and achieved her first electoral success in 1993 when she won only the party's second UK council seat in Oxford. She was elected to the European Parliament in the South East England Region in 1999 \u2013 a seat she held until giving it up after her election to Westminster. Nominations for leadership candidates have been opened and will close towards the end of June. A new leader, or co-leaders, will take up the two year post in early September. The roles of leader, which can be shared, and deputy leader were established in 2008 by the party after it switched from a system of having two principal speakers. The Greens won 34 seats during this month's local elections, a net increase of 11. The party won in target areas such as Reading and Dudley, and defended all six seats in Norwich. It was also third in the list of London-wide assembly members, while its London mayoral candidate, Jenny Jones, came third, ahead of the Liberal Democrat Brian Paddick."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
