Use of the title is protected by law and reserved for established organisations \u201cthat typically undertake research at the highest level, or are professional bodies of the highest standing\u201d. It can be used only after permission has been granted by Companies House and Greg Clark, the business secretary. However, it has emerged that the Institute for Free Trade (IFT), which has already become the thinktank of choice for some leading Brexiters, is facing an inquiry by Companies House after adopting the term without permission. The development is an embarrassment for Daniel Hannan, the Tory Eurosceptic MEP who set up the organisation. Hannan has advocated a Singapore-style Brexit, with the UK becoming a low-tax, low-regulation country to attract more business. The IFT had already attracted controversy after Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, allowed its launch event to take place in the Foreign Office. Besides Johnson, the public meeting took place in the FCO\u2019s Map Room. Guests included leading cabinet Brexiters Michael Gove and Liam Fox. The registered name for the IFT avoids the word \u201cinstitute\u201d; instead the organisation calls itself the Initiative for International Trade Ltd. Companies House said any company that was trading under the title needed permission. It said it was aware of the IFT\u2019s use of the term and would be contacting the company. \u201cIt is an offence to use a sensitive word set out in regulations in a business name without the prior approval of the secretary of state,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cThe offence is committed by the company and every officer of the company. The person(s) guilty of an offence is liable to a fine.\u201d Hannan was contacted for comment on Friday, but had not responded at the time of publication. Chris Bryant, a Labour MP and supporter of the pro-Remain Open Britain group, said: \u201cHannan, Johnson and all those involved in the IFT have some very serious questions to answer. The word \u2018institute\u2019 is rightly reserved for the use of serious organisations of long standing \u2013 not some tinpot hard Brexit thinktank that has only been active for a few months. Using the word in breach of the rules shows utter disrespect for the many institutes in our country that conduct thoughtful public policy research.\u201d A spokeswoman for the IFT said: \u201cEstablished as a not-for-profit earlier in the year, the IFT now has a registered office and permanent staff, and is taking advice from Companies House regarding the trading name of IFT.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
