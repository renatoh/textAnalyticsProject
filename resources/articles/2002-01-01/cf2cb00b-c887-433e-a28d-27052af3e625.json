It means they are more likely to get good snow. This season Easter breaks have sold much quicker than last year, largely because the holiday falls two weeks earlier - Easter Sunday is 31 March. Like the Christmas and new year break, the Easter school holidays attract a large, loyal following of families. Many return year after year to the same chalet or hotel where they know they can trust the childcare facilities, good ski schools and a variety of runs. If you still haven't booked your ski break, do it soon. There is still some family accommodation left, but it's disappearing fast. The under-fours M\u00e9ribel: Leave your baby or toddler at your chalet in the care of a qualified nanny in this French resort with Scott Dunn Ski (020 8682 5050). The nanny can take three- or four-year-olds to Les Petites Loup kindergarten, where the children get used to the snow with the aid of qualified instructors, and enjoy ski tows or play with inflatable playground characters. The kindergarten is open daily from 9am until 5pm. A week's stay at the Grand Ours catered chalet, which sleeps eight, costs \u00a31,045 per person, including flights from Gatwick to Geneva on 24 March and transfers.

A morning at the kindergarten costs around \u00a312, or \u00a368 for six mornings.

A one-week stay at the three-star Hotel Waldeck with Powder Byrne (020 8246 5300) costs \u00a3887 a head, including flights leaving Heathrow on 30 March, transfers and half-board accommodation. Parents of babies and under threes can drop them off at the cr\u00e8che, a short walk from the Waldeck at the Hotel Adula. This runs from 9am to 4pm six days a week, and the children eat lunch there. The cost is \u00a3200 a week per child. Children aged from four to nine can go to the Yeti club five days a week for\u00a3300 a head.

This is another firm with a team of qualified nannies to do that for you. Designed for children between four and 10 years who are old enough to attend ski school, the Snowflake Club brings them back for a hot lunch before an afternoon of activities, which could include building a snowman, model-making, painting and drawing.
