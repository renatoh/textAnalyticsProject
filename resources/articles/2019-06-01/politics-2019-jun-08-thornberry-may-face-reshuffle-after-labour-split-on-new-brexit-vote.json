There is also growing support from some of Corbyn\u2019s allies, including union leaders close to the leader\u2019s office, for a new contest to be held that could see Tom Watson replaced as deputy leader, following his persistent backing for a public vote on the UK\u2019s exit from the EU. Sources inside Corbyn\u2019s office said last night that there were \u201call sorts of mischievous rumours\u201d being put about, but did not confirm \u2013 or rule out \u2013 imminent changes to the party\u2019s top team. \u201cThey are very angry with Emily and are out to get Tom,\u201d said one shadow cabinet source. \u201cThat has been incredibly obvious over recent days.\u201d Another senior source said: \u201cThere is talk of petitions going round local parties, particularly to rally support for a deputy leadership contest. This would require more than 50 MPs to back it to get off the ground. They may want to do it, but it almost certainly won\u2019t work.\u201d Thornberry was humiliated last week when Corbyn\u2019s office decided to ditch her as the stand-in at prime minister\u2019s questions in favour of shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, who is a close ally of both Corbyn and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. The decision was taken, according to insiders, because Thornberry had blamed the party\u2019s poor showing in the European elections on its ambiguous position over a second referendum and called on the party to give unequivocal backing to a second vote in which the party would campaign for Remain. One idea being floated by Corbyn supporters, say sources, is that Thornberry should swap positions with the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, to help ensure that Thornberry is removed from direct involvement in strategy around Brexit. \u201cThey have been trying to do this for weeks, but Diane refuses to move,\u201d said one senior MP. Shadow ministers also believe that some in Corbyn\u2019s office want to remove Keir Starmer as shadow Brexit secretary, because he had led calls for the party to back a second referendum. But it is thought Corbyn is unlikely to risk a move which MPs believe could lead to Starmer\u2019s resignation. Pressure for a contest to select a new deputy has come from Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union and an ally of Corbyn. He is understood to have the backing of Unite\u2019s general secretary, Len McCluskey. There was intense relief at the top of the party on Friday morning when Labour narrowly retained the marginal seat of Peterborough, seeing off a challenge by Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party. Labour\u2019s candidate, Lisa Forbes, won 10,484 votes, beating the Brexit party candidate, Mike Greene, by 683 votes. The Conservatives were beaten into third place. Corbyn is expected to address the parliamentary Labour party tomorrow about Labour\u2019s performance in the European elections, which saw it lose half its seats."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
