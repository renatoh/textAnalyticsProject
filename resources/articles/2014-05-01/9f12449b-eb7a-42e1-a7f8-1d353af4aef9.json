Learco Chindamo murdered the 48-year-old father-of-four outside his school in north-west London in December 1995 as he came to the aid of a 13-year-old boy who was being assaulted. Lawrence stood between the boy and his attacker and was stabbed by Chindamo. He was paroled in 2010 but his re-release is due soon, it has been confirmed. A spokesman for the Parole Board said: \"We can confirm that a three-member panel of the board has directed the release of Learco Chindamo. \"The decision to release is a matter for the board, which is independent. Practical arrangements for the release are a matter for the Secretary of State. We are unable to comment further on the details of this case.\" A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: \"The re-release of life sentenced offenders is directed by the independent Parole Board once the board are satisfied they can be safely managed in the community. \"Their life licence lasts for the rest of their lives, and they may be recalled to prison at any time for breaching their licence conditions. \"Additionally, they will be subject to strict controls and restrictions for as long as their risk requires them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
