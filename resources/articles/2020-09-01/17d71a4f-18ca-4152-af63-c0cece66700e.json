The England manager plans to speak in more detail to Foden and Greenwood, who were sent home from Iceland, where the team won 1-0 on Saturday, for breaking Covid-19 restrictions, in order to better understand how it happened and to lay the groundwork for reconciliation. Foden and Greenwood jeopardised the security of the squad\u2019s bubble by inviting two women into the team hotel on Sunday, and broke Icelandic protocols with regard to containing the spread of the virus. Southgate has said the pair must regain his trust and it is unlikely he will select them for the international fixtures in October against Wales, Belgium and Denmark. But his admission that the fallout from the controversy went some way towards shaping his approach against Denmark was surprising. Southgate experimented with a 3-4-3 system that had two holding midfielders in front of the defence. England got better when he introduced the more attack-minded midfielders Mason Mount and Jack Grealish in the second half but his side finished the game with only one shot on target. \u201cOn the back of everything in the last couple of days, we needed to be secure and solid,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cIf we had been lightweight and wide open and looked a mess we could have left here with a completely different outcome and everybody pointing at what happened [with Foden and Greenwood] as the cause of it. We just needed a solid base to work from.\u201d Southgate decided not to condemn Foden and Greenwood on Monday, possibly so as not to overshadow the buildup to the Denmark game, which was a curious move. But he criticised them strongly after the match and said he now needed to \u201cthink through lots of conversations that need to happen\u201d with them. \u201cI don\u2019t know the two boys well and I need to spend time to understand all of that situation far better than I had time to speak on Monday,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cI literally had 10 minutes before training and five minutes before we left [for Denmark] so for something as significant as we\u2019ve been through, that isn\u2019t an adequate opportunity to really sit and talk things through. \u201cTrust can be built in many different ways. I talked about Ainsley [Maitland-Niles] coming on for 10 minutes [against Denmark] and, as a manager, when you put a player on, you\u2019re looking for the right decisions and the right impact, even in a 10-minute spell. Then you\u2019re happy to give them 25 or 45 and so on.\u201d Southgate had been without eight players because of injury \u2013 Ben Chilwell, Luke Shaw, Jordan Henderson, Ross Barkley, Harry Winks, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, James Maddison and Marcus Rashford \u2013 and a further six had not trained for two weeks or so when they joined up because of their involvement in the Champions League and Europa League finals tournaments in August. They were Kyle Walker, Foden, Raheem Sterling, Kieran Trippier, Greenwood and Conor Coady. Southgate also mentioned how he had \u201canother four who hadn\u2019t played a minute of pre-season due to quarantining and other issues\u201d, who were Trent Alexander-Around, Mount, Harry Kane and Tammy Abraham. He had to deal with the Harry Maguire scandal and, after losing Walker following his red card against Iceland, the Foden and Greenwood affair was the last straw. \u201cYou always have these incidents, it\u2019s just which ones they\u2019re going to be,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThis time we seem to have gone through almost the whole book but it is an incredible environment. It was when I was playing, and it feels even more complex in the modern world. I just think for the players this was a really difficult month to get them anywhere near the level they would want to be.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
