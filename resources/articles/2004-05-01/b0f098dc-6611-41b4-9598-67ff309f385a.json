The plan as mooted by Bernie Ecclestone, the formula one commercial rights holder, is thought to envisage a route down Regent Street and round Trafalgar Square. \"There's a very good chance this is going to happen,\" Ecclestone said yesterday. \"We're working on it.\" The West End, though, may see only the teams' test drivers as the French grand prix takes place two days earlier. David Richards, the BAR-Honda team principal, yesterday praised the idea as a great profile-raising exercise. \"I have been very supportive of the idea of running grand-prix cars in central London,\" he said. \"This is a great opportunity to take the cars closer to the public and what better setting than in Regent Street? It is a great chance to promote the whole sport.\" There is no suggestion that London is contemplating a street-circuit grand prix but some insiders see it as a subtle attempt by Ecclestone to exert pressure on the government to support the British grand prix."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
