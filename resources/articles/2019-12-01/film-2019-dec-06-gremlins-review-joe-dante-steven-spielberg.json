It is a wacky, satirical spectacle of chaos. It consciously alludes to other films, such as It\u2019s a Wonderful Life, The Wizard of Oz and Indiana Jones, and has characters watching Clark Gable and Barbara Stanwyck in To Please a Lady on TV. But on the unconscious level, or semi-conscious level, it surely alludes to Spielberg\u2019s own ET. In fact, Gremlins is ET\u2019s late-spawning evil twin. Hoyt Axton plays Randall Peltzer, an inventor who lives in a sweet, Bedford Falls-type small town, one of whose local characters is an old drunk who rails against foreign automobiles and foreign things generally and claims that US planes in the second world war were sabotaged by evil alien sprites called \u201cgremlins\u201d. On one of Mr Peltzer\u2019s sales trips in a far-off city, he stops by an exotically imagined Chinatown to buy a Christmas present for his teenage son Billy (Zach Galligan); this turns out to be a mogwai, a sweet little bat-eared creature that everyone adores. But Billy breaks the rules about caring for the mogwai, and it spawns horrifying Mr Hyde-type things called \u201cgremlins\u201d, and soon the town is in anarchy, culminating in an uproarious visual gag involving an old lady\u2019s stairlift going haywire. Gremlins makes fun of America\u2019s materialism, its suspicion of foreigners, and its ironic reliance on foreign-made toys and gadgets at Christmas and any other time. There are also some very sharp lines. Billy\u2019s girlfriend Kate (Phoebe Cates) hates Christmas with a passion and sympathises with other Christmas refuseniks: \u201cWhile everyone else is opening their presents, they\u2019re opening their wrists!\u201d The reason for this is that her dad suffered a bizarre Christmas-related death. There is another very adult line that never ceases to startle. When a little kid is shown how a gremlin is undergoing a transformation, he is told: \u201cHe\u2019s going through change\u201d; \u201cLike my mother\u201d; \u201cNo, this is different.\u201d If Gremlins were to be made today, I don\u2019t think its outrageously orientalist fantasy of Chinatown, with the aged Chinese grandpa with the long hair, spindly moustache and blind eye, would get past the script stage. The gremlins nonetheless deliver quite a bite. \u2022 Gremlins is released in the UK on 6 December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
