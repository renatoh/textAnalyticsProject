Japan's wealthy capital can appear to be a destination few would attempt on a budget. In reality, however, high costs can be something of a myth. The fast-paced metropolis has many affordable options for tourists prepared to research their trip. First-time visitors will find that, in general, Japan has cultural advantages that reduce costs. With the exception of a 5% VAT on goods, every price is all inclusive. Tipping is not a feature of Japanese culture. In fact, staff will usually follow you with change if you try to leave extra money. Holiday extras such as bottled water, cigarettes and snacks are also affordable. The economic climate of the city has also changed, meaning that Tokyo no longer operates in a culture of extreme wealth. Even within the last year, the yen has fallen by around 10% of its value against the pound. Transport, in the form of subways and express trains, is clean, fast, and very efficient. A short subway journey costs 160 yen - the equivalent of 80p - while an all-day ticket costs \u00a35.20. This represents a bargain in a place as vast as Tokyo, which is the equivalent of several sub-cities conglomerated into one large area. More importantly, the underground system always runs on time. Not only does this mean you waste less of your day stuck in tunnels, you can also visit more of the city for the price of your ticket. Common sense should warn you not to travel by taxi. Drivers charge \u00a33.20 for the first two kilometres and 40p for each additional 274 metres. Although this is not exorbitant, Tokyo is a very large city, and metre charges soon add up. More importantly, after 11pm there is a 30% surcharge. As subways and buses stop running at midnight, the transport situation requires some careful thought if you intend to go out drinking. It is rarely advisable to simply \"do what the locals do\" in Tokyo. In real terms, this means earning a six-figure salary. However, as a visitor you can stay close to the centres of nightlife because you don't have to commute. Alternatively, many people simply stay out until 5am when the tubes start running again - after all, you don't have to work in the morning. Where to stay The falling yen is not the only reason why Tokyo represents good value for those on a budget. In general, tourists with a little local knowledge can reap dividends. Hotel accommodation in general is prohibitively expensive. Even a moderate hotel can set you back a few hundred pounds a night. However, youth hostels in Tokyo are palatial by comparison with western counterparts. Most rival the standard offered by mid-range hotels in England, and are often overlooked by tourists. Hotel New Koyo 2-26-13 Nihonzutsumi, Taito-ku (+3873 0343, newkoyo.com) This costs a mere \u00a314 a night. It is advertised as the cheapest hostel in Tokyo, although you can get cheaper if you forgo showers. The YMCA Asia Centre of Japan 8-10-32 Minata-ku, Akasaka (+3402 6111, asiapacificymca.org/hotel/holtel/itbsnet/japan.htm) More like a western hotel, it costs \u00a351 per night, and is clean and peaceful, with good communal areas. The biggest advantage is the location - about 20 minutes' walk from major nightlife spots. Tokyo International Youth Hostel 18F, Central Plaza, 1-1- Kagurakashi, Shinjuku-ku (+33235 1107, email: reservation-yh@titan.ocn.ne.jp) Ideal for families, with large clean rooms, and beautiful Japanese bathing facilities. The food is also good value - a first-rate traditional Japanese breakfast costs \u00a32. Guests are expected to be out between 10am and 3pm, however, and there is a strict curfew of 10pm. Dormitory rooms cost \u00a318 a night for adults and \u00a310 for children. Hotel Sky Court Taito-ku, Asakusa (+3815 4411) YMCA members can stay here for \u00a326 per night. The hotel is also well located, and has no curfew. Where to eat Tokyo is heaven for foodies, with restaurants everywhere serving up cheap ramen and sushi. You can pick up the ubiquitous snack of rice and fish wrapped in seaweed for 50p and a meal for \u00a33 a head even in the most upmarket retail district. A good option is the many restaurants that display vending machines outside. Simply choose a picture, slide in your money, and take the ticket to the restaurant counter. Jangara Sotobori-dori, Minata-ku, Akasaka, 11-3pm, 5pm-12.30am For huge bowls of ramen, with various accompaniments from \u00a32.70 a bowl. It has a great atmosphere, looking like a bamboo lean-to next to the Hie shrine. Sometaro 2-2-2 Nishi, Taito-ku, Asakusa, noon-12am Osaka is famous for cheap, make-your-own omelette restaurants, but Tokyo has a few versions of its own. At Sometaro, customers choose from bowls of ingredients from \u00a33. You then cook this at the griddle-cum-table at which you are seated - cross-legged, of course. Shion 3-25 Shinjuku-ku, Shinjuku, 10am-8pm One of many bargain revolving sushi restaurants in the heart of Shinjuku. Plates are priced from 50p to 80p, and this includes as much green tea as you can drink. Owariya 1-1-3 Taito-ku, Asakusa, 11am-3pm, 5pm-12.30am Two of the three famous soba (buckwheat noodle) restaurants in Tokyo serve meals from \u00a32.50 andthis one is renowned for its fresh, cold noodles served daily. Sushi connoisseurs might want to try the Tsukiji Fish Market, which opens daily from 5am until around 11am. Small cafes bordering the market serve up the world's freshest sushi breakfasts for about a fiver. Where to drink If you come to Tokyo, you have to get supremely drunk in the local bars and clubs. This is a national pastime, and what the Japanese lack in tolerance, they make up for in endurance. Unfortunately, an average bottle of beer costs \u00a34. One solution is to go to bars that have set prices per drink (usually around \u00a35) and order a cocktail with six shots in it. Similarly, karaoke bars often have all-you-can-drink offers instead of happy hour. You can also buy yourself a can of beer at any time of the day or night for \u00a31.70, and careful hunting will get you off-licence prices similar to back home. Bars stay open until the early hours and frequently double as clubbing nightspots, with dance floors. If you are not a dedicated clubber, this can save you untold amounts in drinks and entrance prices. Bar Hama Roppongi BLDG, 5th floor 6-2-35 Minata-ku, Roppongi For an urban Tokyo experience, travel five floors in the elevator to the cool, neon-lit interior of Bar Hama. It also provides excellent views of hectic Roppongi nightlife. Most weekdays, you can get a bottle of beer for \u00a32.50. Hoochie Coochie 25-5, Sarugaku-cho, Shibuya This is one of the many places in Tokyo boasting a live jazz band. They also serve a very unusual selection of cocktails, which can add a cultural flavour to the evening's drinking. Ryu-Sen 12-18 Udagawacho, Shibuya-ku, Shibuya For a cheerful bar reminiscent of an izakaya - or traditional Japanese pub - you are expected to pay a table charge, but the experi ence is quintessentially Japanese, and drinks can be as cheap as \u00a32.50 a bottle. Ocean Bar 1F Roppongi, Minata-ku, Roppongi A themed drinking venue in beautiful surroundings. Drinks range from \u00a32.50 to \u00a35, and prices seem to depend on the mood of the staff, so being charming can save you a few yen. What to see For most people, the price of a tube ticket will gain them as much entertainment as they need in Tokyo. Visitors may also enjoy the experience of a traditional Japanese bath, which is a standard facility in most youth hostels. An evening out might include a sumo match, which generally costs around \u00a312 for a day ticket from The Nihon Sumo Kyokai (1-3-28 Yokoami, Sumida-ku) . For this, you can watch the amateur bouts from 9am, right through to the professional matches, which end about 8pm. Be warned, however: Japanese crowds seem to appreciate nuances of sumo entertainment that will be lost on westerners. Traditional Japanese gardens can be seen for free, with a good example being Hibiya Park (Hibiiya Koen 1-6, Chiyoda-kuin). Definitely not to be missed is the man-made island of Odaiba, off Tokyo bay. The island includes a beach, a huge shopping centre and a landmark tower. Odaiba is also home to Venus Fort - a state-of-the art retail paradise. The interior of the building has been modelled on an open-air European city, and a computer-animated skyline, which changes throughout the day, is projected on to the ceiling. Other tourist excursions include the electric city of Akihabara - a neon haven of electrical goods. Serious shoppers can pick up laptops at knock-down prices, although larger electrical equipment will need a transformer to work in the UK. An hour out of Tokyo is the fantastic Fujikyu Highlands (5-6-1 ShinNishihara Fuji-Yoshida-shi, 81 0555-23-2111, fujikyu.co.jp/fuji-q) - a theme park containing the world's highest, fastest, steepest rollercoaster. It is a mere \u00a35 a ride, while entrance to the park costs \u00a36. Way to go Getting there: All Nippon Airways (020-7224 8866, anaskyweb.com) flies London-Tokyo from \u00a3803.50 return. However, Tokyo is one of the few destinations that you can still get to as an air courier, which can knock the price down to about \u00a3400. Contact the International Association of Air Travel Couriers (0800 0746481, courier.org). Further information: Japan National Tourist Organisation (020-7734 9638, seejapan.co.uk).
