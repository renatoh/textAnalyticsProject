The tongue-in-cheek video ad for Aviation American Gin, tweeted by Reynolds on Friday, racked up more than 4m views in its first day online. Peloton\u2019s Christmas advertisement, \u201cThe Gift That Gives Back\u201d, shows the character played by Monica Ruiz receiving a Peloton bike as a gift from her husband, who is played by Sean Hunter. She records her workouts over a year and shares them with him through a video blog. The 30-second ad sparked a storm on Twitter, with many calling it sexist. Some said the husband was \u201ccontrolling\u201d and \u201cmanipulative\u201d for buying his wife an exercise bike and that the ad suggested he thought she needed to lose weight. Peloton said it was disappointed some viewers had misinterpreted the commercial\u2019s message. The company saw its share value fall almost $1.5bn (\u00a31.1bn) amid backlash over the ad. Ruiz did not immediately comment on the controversy but Hunter told Psychology Today \u201cfive seconds of air time\u201d had \u201ccreated an array of malicious feedback that is all associated with my face\u201d. \u201cAs my face continues to be screen shot online,\u201d he said, \u201cI wonder what repercussions will come back to me. I pride myself on being a great teacher and developing actor, and I can only hope that this affects neither.\u201d In her new gin ad, Ruiz is one of three women out for a holiday drink. \u201cYou are safe here,\u201d one friend tells her, in response to her shellshocked look. The trio toast new beginnings, the character played by Ruiz downs her drink in one, and the ad ends with a voice saying: \u201cYou look great by the way.\u201c Reynolds, an owner of American Aviation Gin known for his roles in Marvel Comics\u2019 superhero Deadpool movies, told his Twitter followers: \u201cExercise bike not included.\u201d Reynolds has form in spoofing viral stories to sell his juniper-based tincture. Earlier this year, he released an ad referencing a Fyre festival producer\u2019s notorious promise to perform oral sex on a customs official."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
