In the USSR, all Soviet citizens were classified according to their \"nationality\", ie ethnicity. My father was Polish, my mother was Estonian; I didn't know what to choose - I am a mongrel, a Polish-Estonian. But there were no such categories in the Soviet anketas (questionnaires). Finally, as I was born and grew up in Estonia, I opted for being an Estonian. Fortunately there were no questions about one's religious affiliation: I could not have answered those, either. Speciality? Profession? Problems here, too. I've studied linguistics, and written on grammar and language typology. Literature has rarely figured among my main interests; I have spent more time reading books on ecology, anthropology and mathematical sciences than books of verse or novels. I have gained my living doing various jobs, including \"engineer\" in a botanical garden and deputy in the Estonian parliament. I have also been a columnist for various Estonian and Scandinavian papers. However, languages and poetry have had a special meaning in my life. When I was 13, I discovered poetry; it was a kind of revelation. I found that I had learnt enough Russian to be able to read poems by Pushkin or Lermontov. I took a volume of Lermontov, and found a poem called \"Flying Ship\", a free translation of a poem by a little-known Austrian, JC von Zedlitz. The poem is about the journey of Napoleon's ghost from St Helena to his native France. I read the poem, I wept, I was transformed, and began to read Russian, and later English, romantic poems. For me, the discovery of the magic of poetry was also the discovery of the magic of foreign languages. I fell in love with Lermontov and Shelley. Later I got acquainted with major modernist classics - Baudelaire, Rimbaud, TS Eliot - and still later with poetry in Estonian. And of course, I began writing poetry. I have written about 900 poems, about 20 stories and some plays, and translated verse and prose from several languages, including classical Chinese. Beginning with traditional rhymed verse, I later switched to writing texts that are both poetry and prose, both fiction and non-fiction, borrowing from botany or linguistics. As a linguist, I am interested in the influence of one's language on one's literary creation and philosophy. I have written poems in Estonian, but also in English, Finnish, South Estonian and Russian. And, as it's difficult to find translators of literary texts from Estonian to English, I've tried to do the job myself. Of course, I have had fine helpers and editors. Now I know that every language necessarily has its own poetics, its own rhythm, its own way of seeing and describing things, possibly even its own philosophy, as Nietzsche wrote in Beyond Good and Evil. People in the west often ask me what it was like to be a writer, to publish your work in the USSR. It was sometimes difficult, but it was possible. Soviet Estonia was a relatively liberal place, and some party bureaucrats even tried to defend us artists from the over-zealous servants of Big Brother. In a way, Soviet Estonia was a huge, passive anti-Soviet conspiracy, and we all had a role in it. My homeland is here, in Estonia, but my spiritual homeland is the nebulous border region between literature and science, poetry and prose, fiction and non-fiction. I share this borderland with some Chinese literati of the past. I think these people, too, had an aversion to definitions and characterisations, and invented many ways to avoid them. Sometimes they called themselves yun-shui (\"cloud-water\"), stressing their affinity with things that have no clear-cut borderlines, no well-defined form. I like the ancient fuzzy logic of these Taoists, and feel at home in their company."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
