Speaking to his party conference in his first big address since being re-elected leader, Mr Salmond said Mr Blair was not a man who had acted in good faith or made an honest mistake. He called afresh for him to be impeached. All prime ministers told \"fibs\", Mr Salmond told the delegates gathered in Inverness. But none, he said, had lied about the reasons for going to war. \"This is a man who buried the intelligence that was inconvenient, manipulated the information to suit his purpose and entered into a secret pact with the American president to go to war, come what may.\" Mr Salmond is one of the organisers, along with Welsh nationalist MPs, of an attempt to force the impeachment issue to a debate in the Commons. \"This prime minister needs to be humbled in an election and next year we will take our case to the country,\" he added. \"But this prime minister deserves to be impeached and we with others will present the case that he should be required to answer.\" This month Mr Salmond was elected as SNP leader, replacing John Swinney, who stood down in the face of mounting criticism at his lacklustre performance. Delegates at Inverness have talked of a fresh sense of purpose after a string of disastrous results in recent elections. Yesterday Mr Salmond, who paid a warm tribute to Mr Swinney, told the delegates he had been persuaded to stand again for the Scottish parliament, despite insisting he never would out of a sense of frustration at devolution. \"I'm back to turf out the overpro moted Labour machine politicians who demean the Scottish parliament,\" he said. In Wales the leader of Plaid Cymru has said a referendum on powers for the Welsh assembly is \"extremely likely\" and should be run by the assembly itself. In his speech to the Plaid party conference, Ieuan Wyn Jones said proposals in the Richard commission report, recommending more powers for Cardiff, were still viable, despite Labour drawing up its own plans. \"When, as seems extremely likely, a referendum is held that referendum should be organised by the assembly rather than through Westminster,\" he said. \"After all, this is a matter for the people of Wales to decide.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
