She is, well, the Queen. He likes to build towers that feature his name in gold. She keeps her gold in the Tower. In public and private, he runs the gamut from boorish and braggadocious to mindbogglingly bigoted. In public and private, she doesn\u2019t. As Donald J Trump spends quality time with Queen Elizabeth II on his state visit to the UK this week, the blinding reality is that this is no meeting of minds. It is true that these visits are supposed to demonstrate the enduring alliance between the two countries, not their respective heads of state. But this special relationship has all the personal charm of a hardened convict meeting his probation officer. You know he\u2019s going to reoffend; the only question is one of timing. The sight of Trump\u2019s welcome at Buckingham Palace may be a pomp-filled mark of acceptance of a pompously needy president. Yet it remains true that the US is happy to receive the recognition, and Britain must be delighted that it still has something worth conferring on a world leader, even while the nation celebrates his arrival with street protests and a giant inflatable baby. To Trump himself, the yawning chasm between him and the longest-serving British monarch is not as obvious as it is to the rest of humanity. He may even feel that the joke is on all those snooty Manhattanites who have disdained him for all those decades, but would pay good money for a seat at his state dinner with the biggest Queen ever. (Memo to the Trump 2020 campaign: don\u2019t even think about doing this on a return visit.) Then again, this is a man who still lies about the size of his inaugural crowds, his praise for the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, and his illegal payoffs to a porn star. His grasp of reality and decency is astonishingly weak, but his delusional sense of self-worth is rather remarkable. To be sure, the toffee-nosed Brits love nothing more than preserving their own delusional sense of self-worth by sneering at the arriviste powers. They have a word for it nowadays: Brexit. Yet it\u2019s hard to avoid the inescapable truth that Trump is several leagues below his predecessors in the eyes of most Brits, who enjoy a love-hate relationship with the US, like most of the rest of the world. Trump currently has a 21% approval rating in the UK, according to YouGov polling, which is fully 51 points behind Barack Obama. He is eight points behind Hillary Clinton and seven behind Angela Merkel (memo to the White House: Merkel, not to be confused with Markle, is from Germany.) Trump is even lagging six points behind the dismally unpopular prime minister currently shuffling out of Number 10, having failed to achieve anything of note, including her beloved Brexit. Normal world leaders might read such numbers and heed the obvious warnings about wading into domestic politics. But as we know from numerous sources, Trump doesn\u2019t read much and isn\u2019t too good with numbers. Or warnings, for that matter. Normal world leaders pride themselves on staying above the fray, but Trump looks at frays the same way he looks at Big Macs. When the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan identified him as part of a global alliance of racist far-right leaders, Trump happily took umbrage while still en route to London. Even though he prides himself on leading an alliance of racist far-right leaders, Trump tweeted that \u201cKahn\u201d \u2013 who is several weight classes below the presidential level \u2013 was a \u201cstone cold loser\u201d. There is something of a pattern to these pre-travel spasms for this president. Before leaving for London, Trump told the Sun: \u201cI think I have great polls.\u201d He also said that a Brexited UK could have \u201ctremendous\u201d trade numbers with the US because \u201cthey have never had a president like me that understands this\u201d. They surely haven\u2019t. This could be an awkward few days for the bad boys of Brexit. Trump made no secret of his love and admiration for Boris Johnson (\u201che would be excellent\u201d) and Nigel Farage (\u201ca very smart person\u201d), mostly because both have been \u201cvery positive about me\u201d. The last time a catastrophically unpopular president backed a British politician was during the Iraq war, after Bush and Blair started sharing the same toothpaste. Blair remains so toxic that he is three points less popular than Trump in a country that elected him no less than three times. So what could possibly go wrong when Trump embraces his mini-Trumps in Merry Olde England? As he was leaving the south lawn of the White House for his transatlantic voyage, Trump was asked if this kind of blatant meddling with British politics was entirely appropriate. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me the question if you don\u2019t want me to talk about it,\u201d he said, displaying all the diplomatic talent that has led to trade wars with the rest of his own continent and the next largest economy in the world. There will be time for so many more questions with so many more inappropriate answers. Will Trump apologise to Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, for telling the Sun that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know she was nasty\u201d? Will he apologise to the rest of us for claiming that he never said the word, preferring instead to blame \u201cthe fake news media\u201d? \u201cNo,\u201d he told reporters at the White House on Sunday. \u201cI made no bad comment.\u201d This is the bubble that Trump hopes his diehard fans will never leave: a warm cocoon where the king of bad comments never says any such thing, except to nasty people and Latinos who surely had it coming. There are just enough of them to keep Fox News on top of the cable TV ratings, but there aren\u2019t really enough of them to win another election: 52% of registered voters said they definitely would not vote for Trump, according to a Washington Post poll in April. This is not a great place to start your re-election campaign. Still, the Trump campaign is hoping for some quality images from this state visit to help lift their candidate from the sewer of the Mueller investigation and the presidential Twitter account. Who cares if the king of bad comments is meeting the queen of no comment? They all look the same size on TV. \u2022 Richard Wolffe is a columnist for the Guardian US"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
