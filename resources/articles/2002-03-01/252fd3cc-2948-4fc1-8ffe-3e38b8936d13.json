The series will be cut to five meetings, with London expected to join the events in Paris, Zurich, Brussels and Berlin. The world governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, tried for two years to persuade UK Athletics to join the prestigious series but could not reach an agreement on television. The BBC is now keen for the London event to be included on the circuit after agreeing a highlights package for this year's seven Golden League meetings. Sky television currently owns the rights for live coverage but the BBC is expected to replace Sky next year. The IAAF has already decided that this year's Golden League will revert to its original format. An athlete will now need to win every event on the circuit to qualify for the jackpot of 50 kilograms of gold. For the past two seasons five out of seven wins has been sufficient for the jackpot. The IAAF hopes that by including London and making the series more compact it will appeal more to sponsors and television. \"The IAAF recognises that Britain brings so much to the sport in the shape of television, great athletes and history and it simply must be part of the Golden League,\" said an IAAF official. The decision will allay the fears within UK Athletics that the government's failure to keep its promise to build a stadium to host the 2005 world championships would be held against Britain. The IAAF remains keen to stage the world championships in London and has even asked UK Athletics whether it would be interested in bidding for 2009. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
