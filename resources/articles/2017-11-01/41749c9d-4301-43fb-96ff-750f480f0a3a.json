There is recurring, audible hero-worshipping of the midfielder when he dons his country\u2019s colours. So there should be; Davis has not only epitomised his nation\u2019s resurgence under Michael O\u2019Neill\u2019s astute guidance, he stands apart from many in this era when international football can appear a nuisance to more than a few of them. Switzerland\u2019s visit for the first leg of this World Cup play-off marked Davis\u2019s 100th appearance for his country. He is the third player to reach that total for them. The 32-year-old\u2019s career has returned honours with the club he supported, Rangers, and regular appearances in England\u2019s top flight with Southampton. Nonetheless, Davis visibly relishes every game in Northern Ireland colours. It was only reasonable that he received the reward he deserved when leading Northern Ireland towards Euro 2016. Davis is an unlikely perhaps unwilling star, but a star all the same. \u201cFrom when I was able to kick a ball I wanted to be a professional footballer and I wanted to play for Northern Ireland,\u201d said Davis in the programme notes. \u201cWhen I played for Northern Ireland at under-age level my goal was to get into the senior team. Making my debut for the senior team was a moment I will always cherish.\u201d Davis \u2013 a most unassuming, modest individual \u2013 would appreciate a World Cup finals appearance even more. Given his age, it seems reasonable to assume these matches will represent his last hope. He is not alone. Fundamental to O\u2019Neill\u2019s achievements with Northern Ireland has been the retention of experienced players who might ordinarily have backed away from the international scene long ago. Davis had more cause than most to once ponder retirement; he has sampled high points with Northern Ireland but also the many bruising lows which triggered debate as to whether this team could ever even challenge for a finals berth. Davis reached his century as Gareth McAuley collected cap number 75, Jonny Evans his 66th, Chris Brunt a 64th and Kyle Lafferty No67. Should Aaron Hughes return to the side for Sunday\u2019s battle in Basel he will have won 109. O\u2019Neill may rightly rue the shortage of personnel he has to call upon but the core of his squad is a strong one. Davis, who knits the team together, is arguably the most gifted. He also links to an important, once typical, aspect of Northern Irish success, having successfully forged a career in England. Close inspection of Northern Ireland\u2019s opponents offered clues as to the kind of evening Davis would encounter. Switzerland had played 38 matches in their past three qualifying campaigns during which they suffered defeat five times. In only five of their past 38 games did the Swiss not enjoy the majority of possession, moreover. Davis and his midfield colleagues would not want to merely fight fires, though, just as they would have been well aware of how the Swiss are prone to controlling play. Davis was afforded a gift presentation by the president of the Irish Football Association before kick-off, the capacity crowd\u2019s acknowledgement of that intensifying an already impressive atmosphere. By the interval the decibel level had been lowered considerably as the visitors imposed themselves on proceedings. Still, crucially for Northern Ireland, the Swiss had not pressed home that dominance by way of a goal. Davis had fed Lafferty for an early half-chance but the match soon became attritional for them. It was to prove an intriguing evening in that respect; Switzerland displaying the craft but the Irish stubborn in defence. O\u2019Neill\u2019s men typically carried a threat from set-pieces and counterattacks. If Switzerland\u2019s goal was merited, the controversy attached to it was not in keeping with anything that had gone before. Davis and his midfield colleagues had not been able to impose themselves upon a game that was largely controlled by the excellent Denis Zakaria and Granit Xhaka. \u201cYou can keep your Lampard, your Stevie Gerrard\u201d goes the song that refers to Davis in these parts. Those players featured at World Cups. If there was justice, Davis would do likewise. Northern Ireland will need all his industry \u2013 and more \u2013 in looking to retrieve this situation before the weekend closes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
