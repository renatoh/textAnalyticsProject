Two of the three clubs will be promoted automatically and Dean Whitehead's opener after a sterile half-hour began a trio of home goals in the 14 minutes before the interval. It was a scrappy game overall but Plymouth could not match Sunderland's brisk finishing and Argyle remain relegation candidates. The 700 Plymouth fans who made the near-800 mile round trip were given an ovation by their hosts before kick-off. It was some effort on a cold Tuesday night. Two early crunching tackles put an end to such hospitality, Sunderland's Jeff Whitley lunging into Paul Wotton with Plymouth's Paul Connolly exacting quick retribution on Julio Arca. Having kicked off 15 minutes after Wigan, Sunderland's annoyance could perhaps be attributed to the goalscoring bulletins drifting northwards from Brighton. Sunderland were finding breaking through Argyle nowhere near as straightforward. This despite Plymouth's dismal away record - their last away win was on November 6, though it was at Wigan. The game was so scrappy that when Whitehead gave Sunderland the lead in the 31st minute it was the first effort on target from either side. Unwittingly, Whitehead started it all with a poor free-kick into the Plymouth wall. The ricochet turned into a 50/50 challenge won bravely by Arca and the ball was then fed to Steve Caldwell, a centre-half suddenly playing at right- wing. Caldwell's cross was deep and inviting and Whitehead, arguably the pick of McCarthy's cheap buys from the lower reaches of the Football League - \u00a3150,000 from Oxford United - sent a downward header past Luke McCormick. Nine minutes later and McCormick was beaten again. Again Whitehead was a central figure, this time supplying the cross which Arca converted from inside the six-yard box. Having previously been stern, on both occasions Plymouth's defence had gone missing and in the seconds before half-time, the visitors may have wished Graham Coughlan was AWOL. Chasing Marcus Stewart into the area, Coughlan appeared to bring the striker down. Stewart netted the penalty - his 15th goal of the season. It was a harsh award and it all but ended Plymouth's meaningful participation. Plymouth did keep pressing but they were to be let down by McCormick late on. From a 75th-minute corner rescued by substitute Liam Lawrence, McCormick flapped at Lawrence's centre, allowing Caldwell to nod in the fourth. The ease of victory meant McCarthy was able to substitute players with the next game, against Coventry here on Saturday, in mind. Whether the takeover rumours rest is another matter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
