Jones refused to bite on claims from his opposite number, Michael Cheika, that England will go after Australia\u2019s half-backs, responding only with \u201cwe play the game legally\u201d. He did, however, suggest his side\u2019s winning run against the Wallabies will have a bearing on Saturday\u2019s outcome. \u201cThey\u2019ll have a bit of an itch in the back of their head,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the game gets tighter, their memory will go back to those precious games. So that\u2019s an advantage for us, that itch in the back of their head. \u201cWe want to physically dominate them. They\u2019re probably the most physical side in the world and we want to show we can dominate them up front. We\u2019ve got to rise to the occasion. We\u2019re playing against the best team in the world at the moment.\u201d Jones also gave short shrift to any suggestions England have an obligation to entertain when addressing the criticism that followed the lifeless display in the 21-8 victory over Argentina on Saturday. \u201cOur job is to play good English rugby and to beat Australia,\u201d he added. \u201cThere might be 80,000 out there and there might be 40,000 who find it entertaining and 40,000 that don\u2019t find it entertaining. Our job is to win and play good rugby.\u201d If England\u2019s victory in this fixture last year, as well as their 3-0 whitewash in Australia in 2016, has some bearing on Saturday\u2019s match, however, so too will the Wallabies\u2019 seven-match unbeaten run that includes victories over New Zealand and last weekend against Wales. Accordingly, Jones has recalled Owen Farrell to breathe life into a back-line that failed to ignite against Argentina but Maro Itoje is only named among the replacements. Joe Launchbury starts to add some second-row ballast but Jones is relishing the chance to unleash Itoje from the bench. \u201cWe just felt that the benefit of him not playing rugby this week wasn\u2019t there,\u201d said Jones. \u201cThat we could give him what he needed to keep improving in terms of his physical conditioning. \u201cAnd he\u2019s just so fresh and eager to go. It\u2019s like he\u2019s had a pre-season, like he\u2019s had a break. It\u2019s like he\u2019s been away to Barbados for three weeks. He\u2019s really ready to go.\u201d Dylan Hartley, meanwhile, has called on his side to help kickstart the Ashes with an England win against Australia. England\u2019s cricketers begin the defence of the urn in Brisbane next week and Hartley revealed he has been in recent contact with former captain Alastair Cook. \u201cI\u2019m going to watch the Ashes, I want England to win the Ashes, I want us to beat Australia, it\u2019s important [that we do],\u201d Hartley said. \u201cWe\u2019re not motivated or affected by external noise. It\u2019s nothing to us, we want to win, we want to play a good game of rugby, we want to play good wining rugby. First and foremost winning \u2013 that\u2019s the key thing there.\u201d England: A Watson (Bath); J May (Leicester), J Joseph (Bath), O Farrell (Saracens), E Daly (Wasps); G Ford (Leicester), B Youngs (Leicester); M Vunipola (Saracens), D Hartley (Northampton, capt), D Cole (Leicester), J Launchbury (Wasps), C Lawes (Northampton), Robshaw (Harlequins), S Underhill (Bath), N Hughes (Wasps).
