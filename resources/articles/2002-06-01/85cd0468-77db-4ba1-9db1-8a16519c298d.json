Weaknesses: tendency to policy-wonkery, untested public speaker. Did say: 'Third Way triangulation is much better suited to insurgency than incumbency.' Has never said: 'Forget Europe, fancy a pint?' Future: in Cabinet before the next election, sky's the limit after that. DAVID LAMMY Age: 29 Present job: Minister for Health Strengths: assured public speaker who amazed backbench colleagues with his maiden speech in the House of Commons which was at once self-deprecating and witty. Close to Labour high command. Weaknesses: lacks the political depth of contemporaries, danger that he has been catapulted too quickly into government. Did say: 'Get as much of your teachers' brains as you can, that is a passport to success. That is for free. All you have to do is listen, take it in and you are off.' Has never said: 'What we need is a good old-fashioned dose of socialism.' Future: Possible Cabinet material after next election. Sure to have party conference eating out of his hand after this year's appearance. YVETTE COOPER Age: 33 Present job: Parliamentary Secretary , Lord Chancellor's Department. Strengths: takes women's issues and public health seriously, solid House of Commons performer. Weaknesses: her marriage to Ed Balls, chief economic adviser to Gordon Brown, means she is greeted with suspicion by many departments who think she is a Treasury spy. Public appeal is limited. Did say: 'It's the only way to avoid bow legs from lugging huge bags between London and the constituency.' (On why she has two washing machines) Has never said: 'Gordon acts like he runs the world.' Future: definite Cabinet material after the next election, future as head of one of the big spending departments, probably health. RUTH KELLY Age: 34 Present job: Financial Secretary to the Treasury Strengths: Ultra-loyal,clever Blairite and expert on economic issues, has played a quiet game, taking care not to rock any political boats. Weaknesses: can sound too much like a New Labour automaton. Her conversation was once described as 'sounding as if produced by a central computer'. Did say: 'Feminism tempered by Catholicism.' (On her political philosophy) Has never said: 'Children, I can't stand them.' (She had three in quick succession) Future: first female Chancellor of the Exchequer. ...and how they fit together: David Miliband is the brother of... Ed Miliband who works with...
