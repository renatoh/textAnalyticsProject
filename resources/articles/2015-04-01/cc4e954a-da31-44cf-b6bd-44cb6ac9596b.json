Night. 90 min+2: Milan win a corner on the left. Nothing comes from it. 90 min+1: Nigel De Jong tries to score with a bicycle kick. Yep. Handanovic saves comfortably. 90 min: Shaqiri whacks a ball over the top. Icardi brings it down beautifully and shoots, but the ball fizzes just wide. Unlucky. 89 min: Shaqiri wallops one over from 25 yards. 85 min: Destro turns and zings a shot at Handanovic from 20 yards. 84 min: Now Hernanes is vooked for a foul on Paletta. 83 min: D\u2019Ambrosio is booked for taking an agricultural clump out of Bonaventura. 82 min: Abate is booked. 81 min: D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s dipper from 20 yards doesn\u2019t fall in time, the ball flying over the bar. Milan introduce Alessio Cerci in place of Poli. 79 min: Juan Jesus\u2019s daisycutter from 20 yards is pushed aside at full stretch by Diego Lopez. The Milan goalkeeper then claws away the corner, the ball is driven back into the box, and he makes a magnificent reaction save from Palacio. 78 min: An Inter corner on the right. Shaqiri whips it to the near post, it\u2019s flicked on and Milan just about scramble it away. 77 min: Xherdan Shaqiri replaces Kovacic. 75 min: Another replay shows that Palacio did indeed seem to pull Antonelli down. The pair of them were both racing to get into the box and it was Palacio who threw himself at Hernanes\u2019s cross, thereby stopping Diego Lopez to gather the ball and forcing Mexes into his rather clumsy intervention. 74 min: It seems that the goal was disallowed because Palacio fouled Antonelli off-the-ball during the build-up. Roberto Mancini is seething, but it looks like a good spot by the referee. Meanwhile Mattia Destro has replaced Suso, who has faded after a promising start. \u201cEvening Jacob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cLet\u2019s just pretend this MBM never happened, right?\u201d 73 min: It\u2019s been disallowed. I\u2019m not sure why. They had broken at speed and a low cross was fired into the six-yard box by Hernanes, where Mexes got himself into a mess and turned it in. 72 min: Inter think they\u2019ve taken the lead thanks to a Philippe Mexes own goal, but I think it\u2019s been disallowed... 70 min: The limping Alex is replaced by Gabriel Paletta. 68 min: Scoff all you like, but Tom Ince could probably do a job for Inter. 67 min: Inter make their first change, Assane Gnoukouri replaced by Joel Obi. 66 min: I can\u2019t remember Milan\u2019s last attack. 64 min: Palacio saunters down the left and his low cross is met by Hernanes, whose shot is deflected wide. He wants a penalty for handball - replays show it did indeed hit Antonelli\u2019s hand - and a minor brouhaha ensues between the two teams. Eventually it\u2019s sorted out and the corner can be taken. Vidic heads wide. 62 min: A replay of that Palacio chance shows that Mexes blocked it with his thigh, not his hand. 61 min: \u201cAs a long time Milan fan who is crippled with nausea watching the current team, I still found it in me to be insulted by the fact that you\u2019d rather watch that show than this game,\u201d says Apoorv Avram. \u201cIt\u2019s like having your nails pulled out slowly while Danny De Vito watches. Also, Menez has scored a few. That\u2019s all one can really say about him. The Honda/El Shaarawy/Torres possibility had me vaguely interested, but it has been negated so comprehensively that I laughed and cried and cried some more.\u201d 59 min: D\u2019Ambrosio\u2019s cross is deflected into the side netting for another Inter corner. Milan deal with it., 57 min: A chance! An actual chance! A ball is pumped from right to left and Icardi leaps and nods it down to Palacio. He gets there before Diego Lopez and tries to turn the ball in, but his goalbound effort is blocked by a covering Milan defender. Palacio appeals for a penalty for handball, but the referee says no. 56 min: Palacio\u2019s pressure forces Abate to concede a corner on the left. Hernanes overhits the corner. 55 min: Once upon a time, these were two of the best sides in Europe. Hold me. 54 min: Is Jeremy Menez supposed to be good? 53 min: Four minutes pass without anything happening. 49 min: Palacio slams the ball into the Milan net after being set up by Icardi, but unfortunately for Inter the flag is up for offside against Icardi. 47 min: Ace Bonaventura shakes off his marker and shoots from 25 yards. Handanovic watches it dribble wide. 46 min: Milan get the second half underway. The half-time whistle is met with silence. 45 min: There will be one minute of added time. 44 min: Poli is down after falling awkwardly. He may well have hurt his arm. 43 min: This is classic mid-table fare. 40 min: The corner is a waste of time. Let\u2019s watch an episode of Football Italia from 1995. 39 min: Abate crosses and Vidic heads behind for a Milan corner. Vidic holds his head momentarily. Has he suddenly decided he doesn\u2019t like heading? 37 min: Why not? 35 min: Menez twists and turns and pokes a low cross into the six-yard box. Handanovic pushes it away. Moments later Juan Jesus is booked for a foul on Suso. Milan have had the better of the last 10 minutes. 34 min: Did Mancini and Inzaghi ever play together for Italy? 33 min: Gary Medel 1-1 Nigel De Jong. De Jong slides into Kovacic and he goes into the referee\u2019s little black book. 31 min: It gives me no pleasure to see these two sides in their current state. It\u2019s like watching a new episode of The Simpsons. The old magic has gone. 29 min: Suso\u2019s free-kick is devilishly delivered into the six-yard box and it ends with Alex thumping the ball into the Inter net, but the whistle had long gone for offside against the Milan defender. 28 min: Gary Medel pitbulls into Abate and concedes a free-kick on the right. He\u2019s booked. \u201cI think it\u2019s a measure of how far these two teams have fallen that the biggest point of interest in this game is, for me, finding out whether Marco van Ginkel still remembers how to kick a ball in a straight line,\u201d says Matt Loten. 27 min: Hernanes\u2019s effort is a disappointment. I\u2019m not going to bother describing it, that\u2019ll teach him and hopefully spur him on to do better next time. Maybe. 25 min: Palacio darts around the back on the right and his low cross is shovelled behind by Mexes at the near post. The corner is cleared but moments later Medel\u2019s volley from 25 yards is handballed by Antonelli. Inter have a free-kick in a promising position. 24 min: You can be really attacking in a game of chess, you know. You do know that, right? 23 min: BT Sport\u2019s Kevin Gallagher opines that this is a game of chess. But he\u2019s wrong, this is a game of chess. 20 min: Suso makes Handanovic work a bit harder this time. It was almost a carbon-copy move, a smooth shift inside from the right, a shot with his left foot, but this one was struck with more venom and Handanovic had to react smartly to beat the ball away. 18 min: Suso skips inside from the right and works the ball on to his left foot. His shot from 20 yards is reasonable enough, but it\u2019s straight at Handanovic. 15 min: Would you rather be locked in a room for 10 minutes with Katie Hopkins or with Piers Morgan? Choose wisely. 14 min: Jeremy Menez goes on an adventure down the Milan left, zigzagging into the Inter area and prodding a low cross into the six-yard box. Juan Jesus whacks it away. \u201cOh don\u2019t listen to him,\u201d says Jacob Steinberg. \u201cYou\u2019re doing a barely adequate job.\u201d 13 min: Kovacic swings one wide from 25 yards. \u201cHi Jacob,\u201d says Jacob Steinberg. \u201cI think you\u2019re doing a TERRIBLE job.\u201d 12 min: Emails please! Keep your old chum Jake company! 11 min: Inter continue to search for the breakthrough. Hernanes puts that sorry corner episode behind him and puts some oomph into a shot from 25 yards, forcing Diego Lopez, bane of Iker Casillas, to claw it behind for a corner. Milan survive. 9 min: Inter have started quite well. Gnoukouri breaks into space on the right and shuffles a pass to Palacio, who\u2019s clear for a split-second in the area. But he takes too long to get a shot away and Mexes is on hand to shut the move down. 8 min: The corner from Hernanes is total nonsense, struck along the ground to the Milan defender at the near post. That was atrocious and it probably explains a few things. 7 min: Palacio has an amble down the left and forces Alex to concede the game\u2019s first corner. 6 min: Suso gets on the ball for the first time. Did the on-loan Liverpool winger watch the game earlier, I wonder? 4 min: It is loud. The fans have turned up tonight. Let\u2019s hope they\u2019re rewarded with a spectacle. 2 min: Hernanes turns brightly on the edge of the Milan area. Mexes blasts the ball away uncompromisingly. And we\u2019re off! Inter, kicking from left to right in the first half, get the game underway. The San Siro crowd fizzes. Give it a few minutes, that might not last long. The players are out. The football is imminent. Inter: Handanovic; D\u2019Ambrosio, Ranocchia, Vidic, Jesus; Gnoukouri, Medel, Kovacic; Hernanes; Palacio, Icardi. Milan: Diego Lopez; Abate, Alex, Mexes, Antonelli; Poli, De Jong, Van Ginkel; Suso, Menez, Bonaventura. Hello. It\u2019s the Milan derby! But it\u2019s also a mid-table clash in Serie A! But is the Milan derby! One of the biggest games in the world! But, well, it is a mid-table clash in Serie A, 10th against ninth, a reminder that Inter and Milan are a sorry shadow of their old selves. What has happened to these two? In 2003, this was a Champions League semi-final. Milan were the European champions that year and in 2007; it\u2019s only five years since Jose Mourinho led Inter to European glory. And now? Well it would be wrong to say that you couldn\u2019t pay me to watch this match, because, well, look at me right now, but I\u2019ll level with you, if I wasn\u2019t being paid to watch this match, you can rest assured that I would be watching episodes of It\u2019s Always Sunny In Philadelphia on Netflix instead. Kick-off: 7.45pm in London, 8.45pm in Milan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
