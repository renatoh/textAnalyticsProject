Complaints have flooded in to the Advertising Standards Authority's website since the children's charity launched its campaign less than two weeks ago. The tally is likely to soar once the letters of complaint, held up by the postal strike, have been counted, taking the number of complaints above the 370 recorded for Velvet Toilet Tissue earlier this year. Barnardo's, which has a reputation for using shock tactics in its campaigns, took the unprecedented step of placing full-page newspaper ads on Sunday to defend its advertising against claims the recent images went too far. It apologised to readers distressed by the campaign, which also portrayed a baby with a bottle of methylated spirits hanging out of its mouth. However, the charity it said it was \"necessary to draw attention to the fact poverty still seriously damages the lives and prospects of some children in this country\". It continued: \"If you were personally distressed or offended by the images then we apologise. Having said that, we feel it is our duty to ensure the issue of child poverty in this country is no longer neglected and that is the reason we have run such a hard-hitting campaign.\" Earlier this year the ASA received 370 complaints - one of the highest numbers in recent years - about a campaign for Velvet Toilet Tissue, which featured pictures of naked bottoms of all shapes and sizes However, this was significantly down on the record 730 complaints prompted in 2000 by Yves Saint Laurent's poster campaign for Opium perfume featuring a naked Sophie Dahl. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
