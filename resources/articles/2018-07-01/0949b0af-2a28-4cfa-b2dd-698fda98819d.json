The revelation by the Courier Mail on Tuesday deals a blow to \u201cBig Trev\u2019s\u201d campaign, which has been riding high following polling showing he is running neck-and-neck with Labor\u2019s Susan Lamb and One Nation\u2019s decision to preference the LNP candidate. According to the Queensland parliament\u2019s website Ruthenberg, a former MP in the Newman government, has won an Australian service medal, a distinction awarded for service in or in connection with a non-war operation such as peacekeeping. Ruthenberg was an air-frame fitter and engineer in the 38th squadron of the Royal Australian Airforce, achieving the rank of corporal. Although his campaign material does not refer to his having won a service medal, he does refer to his record of having \u201cserved Australia for six years\u201d in campaign videos. On Tuesday the Courier Mail reported that Ruthenberg had not won an Australian service medal but rather an Australian defence medal, which is awarded to people who have completed four years of service. Turnbull told 3AW Radio Ruthenberg had \u201cmade an innocent mistake\u201d, was \u201cvery embarrassed about it\u201d and had \u201capologised profusely\u201d. \u201cHe misdescribed the medal that he had been awarded ... Big Trev is as honest and straight as he is big \u2013 and he is big,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cHe\u2019s very proud of his service in the airforce ... I\u2019ve spoken to him about it this morning and I\u2019m satisfied it\u2019s an honest mistake.\u201d Ruthenberg reportedly responded to the report by claiming he had \u201cabsolutely no clue\u201d how the mistake had occurred but conceding he may have \u201cscrewed up\u2019\u2019. \u201cIf I screwed up then I screwed up and all I can do is apologise,\u201d he told the Courier Mail. \u201cIt was certainly not intentional and I respect the uniform way too much to claim I earned something I didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have the source documents. If the source documents are wrong then I apologise for that ... If I made the mistake, I made the mistake.\u201d Five byelections will be contested on 28 July, with the Coalition a chance to recapture Labor-held marginals Longman and Braddon in Tasmania. The byelections were triggered by resignations when the high court ruled that having taken \u201creasonable steps\u201d to renounce foreign citizenship was not sufficient to escape the constitutional disqualification on dual citizens in parliament. Labor has campaigned aggressively against Ruthenberg, warning voters if he is elected he will move from being \u201cNewman\u2019s yes man ... to be Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s yes man\u201d. Turnbull has framed the contest as a choice between him or Bill Shorten, claiming his economic policies would result in higher taxes, fewer jobs, lower wages and less economic growth. Guardian Australia has contacted Ruthenberg for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
