That made by Nasser Hussain's men last winter and in the early part of the summer may, in the minds of many, have been negated by the hammering by Australia but, just as David Duval does not become a bad golfer simply because he is beaten by Tiger Woods, that defeat does not necessarily plunge England back into the abyss. If South Africa, generally regarded as the second best side, come unstuck badly in the three-match series which starts here tomorrow, it will put a different complexion on England's recent efforts. For the moment there are those, not least the International Cricket Council which has a vested interest in promoting its world championship, who will contend that, if the South Africans are behind Australia, it is by a smidgen only. Certainly, by the ICC's rules, anything other than a home win in the series will put South Africa top of the table. If that seems odd, given the panache with which Australia have been disposing of opposition during the past few years (including their record-breaking 16 wins on the bounce), South Africa, almost by stealth it seems, have been creating a proud record of their own. Since England came back from the dead to beat them in the summer of 1998, they have lost none of 12 series and only three of 35 Tests. The Australians may be keen to claim the high ground on the strength of winning the previous meetings home and away between the sides (3-0 coming up, says Shane Warne, and such is the pace at which the game is played these days, it might not be mere hokum) but the South Africans are a tidy outfit. By yesterday neither side had settled on their XI. Australia, who have been known to go firm on a team days in advance, were apparently unsure even of their strategy. Their quandary centres on whether the leg-spinner Stuart MacGill should get a place alongside Warne, probably at the expense of Brett Lee but perhaps of a batsman, or whether the tried and tested three-man pace attack should prevail. Indeed, MacGill's presence in the Australian 12 has prompted two unusual pronouncements: one, from the chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns, warned that the bowler, a notoriously maverick character, had better fit in with the team ethic or else; the other, from Warne, emphasised what a good chap MacGill was, so much so that they have even had dinner and a drink together. MacGill's inclusion in the 12 is a response to the notion that the Adelaide pitch turns. As no wrist spinner other than the left-armer Michael Bevan and the unique medium-fast Indian Bhagwat Chandrasekhar has taken five wickets in an innings on the ground since Richie Benaud 40 years ago -not even Warne - this is flying in the face of the evidence. The groundsman Les Burdett seems to think it is a lot of eyewash too, suggesting that the pitch might dust up later but that the bounce will become uneven as well - and it is the pacemen who exploit that best. Indeed it is the pace attacks of the two teams who will dominate both this match - where the unseasonably cold weather promises to keep the pitch juiced up - and the series: Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie and Lee versus Shaun Pollock, Allan Donald, who has sent home for an old pair of boots to remedy a sore toe and is uncertain to play, and Jacques Kallis. The comparison between McGrath and Pollock, indisputably the two finest pace bowlers in the world at the moment, will be particularly intriguing. They are similar in method: close in to the stumps, attacking from just short of a length, with merciless accuracy. If McGrath has marginally the better strike rate (a wicket every 51 deliveries or so compared with 53 for Pollock), then it is Pollock's phenomenal average of 20.15 for his 253 wickets that holds sway over McGrath's 21.83 for 363. There is little to choose. On balance McGrath is the more grudging and parsimonious, Pollock the more instinctive with better variation. The series then could be determined by which set of batsmen copes better with the constant pressure. There will be no respite. On paper Australia's have the edge, though there have been signs that cracks are appearing and there are only so many times Adam Gilchrist can bail them out. Both sides have great depth but in Kallis South Africa have a batsman who for a year has been playing as well as anyone in the world. They are also preparing to give a debut at No3 to a 20-year-old, Jacques Rudolph, which is a seasonable move if nothing else. If he gets a red nose, it can only be from the cold."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
