The PLO voted to end cooperation with Israel and the US in 2018 and left it up to Abbas when to implement such a move. The Palestinian Authority (PA) president has threatened to stop such cooperation several times before, and it was unclear on Tuesday what his declaration would mean in practice, especially in terms of the future of the Palestinian security apparatus. \u201cTo pass the bar of credibility as a threat, to show this is not the same as the umpteen threats that they\u2019ve previously issued of a similar nature and that they never acted on, the bar is very high,\u201d said Daniel Levy, the president of the US/Middle East Project \u201cWe will actually have to see Palestinian action.\u201d Some reports from Israel suggested that Palestinian security officials had been ordered to stop talking to their Israeli counterparts. But Palestinian officials have to coordinate with Israeli officers even to move between areas within the West Bank. Abbas\u2019s declaration follows the creation of a new Israeli government which is officially contemplating annexation of some areas of the West Bank, apparently with the support of the Trump administration. \u201cI do think this moment is qualitatively different than any other moment in the past, and that\u2019s because Israel does look like it is prepared to annex some part of the West Bank,\u201d Zaha Hassan, a human rights lawyer and visiting fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said. \u201cNot only is there nobody to stop Israel from moving forward, but also the US is a partner to this plan.\u201d According to Israeli Channel 13 television, the Israeli ambassador to the US, Ron Dermer, had been urging annexation before the US elections in November. \u201cWe must advance annexation now because we don\u2019t know what will happen in the US presidential elections. [Democratic candidate Joe] Biden could win,\u201d Dermer is reported to have said in confidential briefings in Washington. \u201cThere is a window of opportunity now, so it must be done now.\u201d Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah warned on Saturday that Israeli annexation could lead to \u201ca massive conflict\u201d between his country and Israel and did not exclude a suspension of the 1994 peace treaty between them. Abbas\u2019s declaration could lead to the end of intelligence sharing between Palestinian, Israeli and US security services. But it gave no hint of what Palestinian forces would do, when Israeli soldiers carry out incursions into Palestinian areas, or what it would mean for Palestinian movement around the West Bank between parts entirely administered by the PA (Area A), jointly run areas (B) and Israeli settlement zones (Area C). \u201cWhat does it mean on the ground for PA security who \u2013 even to travel from area B to area B, through Area C \u2013 have to get permission from the Israeli army. Does that mean that if everything is frozen, that PA security can\u2019t access certain parts of Area B,\u201d asked Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington. \u201cThese are the kinds of questions that I think Palestinians will be asking, and then the Israelis, but I\u2019m not sure there are clear answers.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
