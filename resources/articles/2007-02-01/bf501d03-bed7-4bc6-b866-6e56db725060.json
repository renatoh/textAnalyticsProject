Working longer hours means more money spent on childcare and domestic help. In wealthier areas, house prices and the general cost of living are often higher. Greater economic activity leads to more congestion and longer commuting times. The standard measures of economic growth singularly fail to take into account these factors, so could it be time to introduce a new holistic economic measure that takes into account the social and environmental costs caused by economic output? In the 1990s, economists proposed just such an idea - an index of sustainable economic welfare (ISEW) - for the UK, following work in the US. It was an attempt to build on this foundation and rekindle the debate that has led Regeneris to develop an index that could be reproduced at a national, regional and district level. The Regeneris sustainable prosperity index (SPI) takes household income as a starting point and makes adjustments for regional price differences. It takes into account the time and costs involved in commuting and congestion, the value of unpaid domestic labour, and the cost of greenhouse gas emissions. The SPI is the first of its type to cover all the local authority areas of England and paints a rather different picture from the conventional measures. It shows that the gap between London and other regions narrows substantially once the true costs of wealth production are considered. While London is still the highest performing region, it is only 9% above the national average, compared to 17% when measured by household income. This reflects higher house prices, living costs and increased commuting. By contrast Yorkshire &amp; Humberside moves from 10% below average to exactly the average with the SPI, and from eighth in the regional league tables to fourth. At district level, the City of London, Kensington &amp; Chelsea and Westminster top the SPI table, due to exceptional income levels. However, parts of London, such as Barking &amp; Dagenham and Newham, with modest incomes but high living costs, slip to the bottom of the league - emphasising the greater divide between rich and poor in London. Outside the capital, Macclesfield in Cheshire - with high income and relatively low prices - is one of the highest ranking districts. Many of the lowest performing districts were associated with a heavy decline in their industrial base - such as in Knowsley and Blackburn in the north-west, and Bolsover and Sandwell in the Midlands - rather than inner urban deprivation. While we do not pretend that the index captures all the factors affecting quality of life, it does provide a valuable alternative viewpoint, and it raises some important questions. Are GDP and Gross Value Added suitable ways to measure progress? Should the pursuit of economic growth be an end in its own right, or should there be more systematic efforts to measure the trade-offs between growth and the costs of that growth? We hope it will provoke a wider debate about the future shape of economic policy in the regions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
