But this performance of Bach's St Matthew Passion, part of the Cheltenham music festival, was beyond doubt the finest I've ever heard - technically, emotionally and spiritually. It wasn't just the control, the wonderful slow but fluid pacing that made Davis's interpretation so moving and revelatory. The performance was obviously a labour of love for everyone involved, from the leaders of the two orchestras - Joshua Bell and Krysia Osostowicz - to the boys of the Gloucester Cathedral Choir and Isserlis himself, modestly content with the cello continuo role. It isn't often you see star singers smiling, eyes closed, nodding along to the music. Granted, this wasn't the kind of performance to please hardline early music specialists, but Davis didn't completely ignore the period-instrument legacy. There was an authentic-sounding 18th-century viola da gamba in the bass aria Komm s\u00fcsses Kreuz (Come, sweet cross), and Bell used vibrato very sparingly in the glorious alto aria Erbarme dich (Have mercy). The BBC Singers were as crisp and clean as they always are, and there were moments of extraordinary poetry, particularly the ethereal sound of the unaccompanied choir in some of the chorales, and the moment when, for a few rapturous seconds, they intoned the words of the Roman centurion at the foot of the cross: \"Truly this man was the Son of God.\" As for the solo singing, questions of \"appropriate\" style were irrelevant. Soprano Susan Gritton was exquisite in Aus Liebe will mein Heiland Sterben (My Saviour dies for love), and there was a noble Mache dich mein Herze rein (Make my heart pure) from bass Stephan Loges. When David Wilson-Johnson delivered Christ's dying words his dignified pathos set the hairs prickling on my scalp. When Mark Padmore as the Evangelist repeated and translated those words - \"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\" - the intensity was almost unbearable. Padmore remained standing in the pulpit for the entire three and a half hours. If he felt any strain, he never showed it. Authentic? In the musicological sense, it wasn't. But a performance that touches as powerfully, and that underlines the sacred mystery of the text so consistently, deserves to be called authentic in the highest possible sense."}, "isHosted": false}}}
