Margaret Beckett, Foreign Secretary, loses her temper with the mild-mannered Today presenter Edward Stourton when he asks her about the situation in the Middle East. Touchy! 'You would be in the Clyde with a block of concrete round your neck and I would be in court for your murder.' Gail Sheridan, wife of MSP Tommy, gives evidence in his libel trial. If he'd been an adulterer, ran her logic, he'd have had more to deal with than some pesky hacks. 'I'd watch Richard and Judy, take drugs, watch a film, drug myself to bed.' Russell Brand describes a day in the life of his unreformed self. We know daytime TV's not great, but isn't that going a bit far? 'I hate the images I see on TV. It's time for a revolution.' Damon Albarn comments on Israel's war. 'Alarmism might even become secretly thrilling, effectively a form of climate porn.' A report by the Institute for Public Policy Research takes the government (and the media) to task over sensationalist stories. 'She's the most overrated person in pop history. She might have meant something once but I don't know many people my age who care.' Lily Allen follows the first rule of rock'n'roll self-promotion and criticises Madonna. She's in good company: last week, Vatican officials, Muslim and Jewish leaders had a go at Madge, too. 'I can only talk about weapons of mass destruction.' Bianca Jagger responds to inquiries about her days as a disco queen at New York's famous Studio 54. 'All you can do is play music to the best of your ability. You fail as well as you can.' Simon Rattle proves that he lacks the arrogance of other maestri."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
