Israeli police said 15 people and the bomber were killed in the Jerusalem attack with at least 65 casualties, including 15 people in a serious condition. Meanwhile in Gaza, Palestinian doctors said at least seven people were killed in an air strike. Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, condemned both attacks and offered his condolences to the families of the dead. The attacks have tonight left the US-backed \"road map\" to an Israeli-Palestinian peace dangerously imperiled but Mr Annan said they should not deter efforts to resolve the conflict. \"I think it is important that the leaders stay the course,\" he said. \"The only path to peace is the road map.\" The Palestinian prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas, called on Palestinian militants and Israel to halt all attacks and said immediate steps should be taken to implement the peace plan. \"Stopping this deterioration necessitates that all parties should comply to a ceasefire and end violence and to start serious efforts to implement the road map,\" said a statement from his office. Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian president, condemned both attacks. \"I strongly condemn this terrorist attack that targeted Israeli civilians today in Jerusalem,\" he said in a televised address. \"I also condemn the [Israeli] operations that took place in Gaza and other operations in which Palestinian civilians were killed and wounded.\" The Gaza attack took place shortly after police said a suicide bomber on Jaffa Street, one of Jerusalem's main shopping streets, set off a blast near Mahane Yehuda, Jerusalem's outdoor market - a frequent target for suicide bombings in the past. The explosion was heard throughout the city and ambulances raced to the scene. Chen Knafo, an Israeli security guard at a nearby bank, said he heard a loud explosion. \"I saw a girl, about 15 or 16, who was blown from the bus. I took her aside and gave her first aid until a medic came,\" said Mr Knafo, whose white shirt was soaked with blood. The Reuters news agency reported that Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack on a website linked to the militant group. A leader of Hamas's military wing, Tito Massaoud, was meanwhile reported to be among those killed in the airstrike that came minutes later on a car in a Gaza City residential district. A second Hamas activist, Sohil Abu Nahel, and four passersby died. The vehicle was stuck in a traffic jam, said shopkeeper Massoud Ramadan, 65, who witnessed the strike. \"When we started trying to evacuate [the passengers] from the car, another missile attack took place while a huge number of people were gathering trying to help the wounded,\" said Mr Ramadan, who was injured by shrapnel. The sudden intensification in violence comes a week after the US president, George Bush, launched the road map to an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal by 2005. It follows an Israeli assassination attempt yesterday on Abdel-Aziz al-Rantissi, a Hamas political leader, and the killing of four Israeli soldiers in a joint attack by Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade on Sunday. Mr Bush today condemned the Jerusalem suicide attack. \"The president condemns the attack in the strongest possible terms,\" his spokesman, Scott McClellan, said. The president said yesterday that Israel's helicopter attack on Mr Rantissi, a Hamas hardliner, could make it harder for the new Palestinian leadership to combat terrorism and made no contribution to Israel's security. The chief White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said administration officials were delivering calls to end the violence and get back to talking directly to Israeli and Palestinian officials for the second day running. \"What the president wants to see happen next is for the Israelis and the Palestinian Authority to get back to the business of peace, to get back to the business of the road map,\" he said. One of Mr Rantissi's bodyguards was killed along with a woman in the street in yesterday's attack. More than 20 people were taken to hospital with wounds, some of them serious. Mr Rantissi today stopped short of claiming direct responsibility for the Jerusalem bus attack, but - speaking to the Associated Press from his hospital bed - said \"the Zionists will pay an expensive price for all of their crimes\". The group's spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, told Reuters that the attack was in revenge for Israel's assassination attempt on Mr Rantissi. \"The response is continuing,\" he said. Mr Rantissi had, in recent days, been the public face of Hamas in rejecting the US-led road map to a Palestinian state and pledging to maintain the armed struggle against occupation. The Israeli government specifically blamed him for organising the killing of the four soldiers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
