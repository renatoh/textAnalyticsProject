Wealth manager St James\u2019s Place, announced it had terminated the stock picker\u2019s contract to manage three of its funds \u2013 worth a total of \u00a33.5bn. That mandate, which Woodford has held since launching his own firm five years ago, has now been handed to rivals Columbia Threadneedle Asset Management and RWC Partners. It is the latest blow for the UK\u2019s most renowned fund manager, who said on Wednesday morning he was \u201cextremely sorry\u201d for taking the decision to block investors from pulling cash from his flagship \u00a33.7bn Equity Income Fund. However, he insisted it was in their best interests. In a video filmed in his offices in Oxford and posted on YouTube, Woodford said: \u201cAs difficult a decision as this is, and clearly frustrating for you, our investors, we felt this was necessary to protect your interests. \u201cI\u2019m extremely sorry that we\u2019ve had to take this decision. We understand our investors\u2019 frustration. All I can say in response to that is that this decision was motivated by your interests.\u201d Woodford said he would keep investors informed and the fund would be reopened when \u201cappropriate\u201d, but did not comment on when that might be. The fund will be suspended for at least four weeks, during which time investors cannot pull money out or put money in. The decision to freeze the fund was taken after a rush of customer withdrawals following a series of bad market bets. Investment group Hargreaves Lansdown, whose clients last year accounted for more than 30% of Woodford\u2019s now blocked fund, said on Wednesday it would waive its fee for affected clients as long as the fund was suspended. Emma Wall, head of investment analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cWe have been in communication with Woodford Investment Management to explain why we think this is the right thing to do and have put pressure on them to do the same.\u201d Woodford investors are believed to be still liable for fees of up to 1.7% despite the suspension. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority, defended Woodford\u2019s decision to suspend the fund. \u201cThe alternative would have been much more disorderly,\u201d Bailey told Bloomberg TV in his first comments since the gates were closed on investors on Wednesday. He assured the FCA would be watching Woodford closely as he starts to sell-off his stakes in privately held companies, which are more difficult to turn into cash. Bailey said it was important for funds like Woodford\u2019s to invest in unlisted firms. \u201cThere is always a balance here, we have to have an economy in which there\u2019s investment in illiquid assets. And then it\u2019s a question of how we do it to preserve the integrity of markets.\u201d Bailey cautioned that large funds need to be monitored. \u201cTen years ago we were dealing with the problem of banks that were too big to fail, of course we don\u2019t want funds that are too big to fail.\u201d However the FCA said it was weighing a potential investigation into Woodford, linked to the listing of some of the fund\u2019s private company investments in Guernsey. It was meant to help get around rules that limit the proportion of unlisted investments at 10%, while the total size of his flagship fund continued to shrink. \u201cWhere the FCA believes there are circumstances suggesting serious misconduct or non-compliance with the rules it may open an investigation.\u201d A request by Kent county council\u2019s pension fund to withdraw its \u00a3263m investment is thought to have prompted Woodford to take the decision to suspend the fund. Addressing investors, Woodford said in the video that putting a temporary halt to withdrawals would afford the fund the \u201ctime and space\u201d needed to reduce exposure to illiquid stocks and private companies. He said the capital would be redeployed into \u201cmore liquid stocks in the FTSE 350 but primarily in the FTSE 100 that fit in with my core strategy, but which are more liquid and more conventional, if you like\u201d. Comments posted underneath the video were mixed. Ian Jenkins wrote: \u201cCaught out by his own hubris. Overreached himself.\u201d Meanwhile, Philip Fox wrote: \u201cYou tried to instigate a terrible takeover of Provident Financial. Of which I own shares to the benefit of you and a few others. Your strategy was terrible but you were not interested in people or companies, just short-term share rise.\u201d However, others were more supportive. \u201cNeil is a good guy, I put my kids through uni thanks to him and his funds. I\u2019m keeping the faith, no knee jerking here, in for the long term, \u00a310k invested in 1990 now \u00a3280k. Not bad, cheers Neil,\u201d wrote one supporter under the handle \u201cHam head\u201d. Keith Marsh wrote: \u201cIf anyone can turn this around, it is that man. Investors, relax and let him do what he does and has consistently done best.\u201d Assets in the Woodford Equity Income Fund fell by \u00a3560m in May to \u00a33.7bn, according to data compiled by Morningstar, a financial research company. Woodford built his reputation over 26 years at Invesco Perpetual, where he personally managed \u00a325bn on behalf of pension funds and other investors. He left Invesco in 2013 to set up on his own. Woodford paid himself and his business partner, Craig Newman, nearly \u00a337m in the 2017-18 financial year. The decision to suspend his flagship fund had a knock-on impact , sending shares in his Patient Capital Trust fund down nearly 7%, having tumbled 20% a day earlier."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
