Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, confirmed to MPs yesterday that ministers are drawing up plans to take the unprecedented step of postponing the census, which is due to take place on April 29, as a result of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. At a meeting of senior ministers in Downing Street on Tuesday night, the prime minister was told of growing fears that thousands of enumerators, who personally deliver census forms to millions of households, may be barred from distributing census forms to farms affected by the disease. Such a move would be the the first time in peacetime that that the operation to count Britain's population, which takes place every 10 years, has not been held on the date set down in parliament. The census was first held in England in 1801 after the Census Act was passed in 1800 and has been held every 10 years, apart from 1941 during the second world war. Government sources said last night that postponing the census would be a \"logistical nightmare\". As a first step, the home secretary, Jack Straw, would have to consult parliament to change the census date which has been set in law for Sunday April 29. After that, the government would have to reprint 32m census forms, which all have April 29 printed on them, a process which would take four months. The office for national statistics (ONS), which runs the census, would have to re-hire 70,000 enumerators who distribute the forms and visit people who struggle to fill in the forms. The enumerators, who will wear distinctive yellow jackets and who will carry yellow bags, do not have to visit every household in Britain because many census forms will be sent and returned by post. However, people living in rural areas, especially the elderly and those who live in outlying areas, are one of the key groups which are likely to be visited by the officials. The 1981 census was carried out during an earlier outbreak of foot and mouth disease. But this was restricted to the Isle of Wight, unlike the present outbreak which has spread rapidly across Britain. Officials from the Home Office and the Ministry of Agriculture, who have set up a joint working party, will make a final assessment towards the end of next month on whether to postpone the census. Government sources said last night that if the disease has not been contained by then, they are likely to decide to call for a postponement. Britain was reluctant to introduce a census until 1801, despite William the Conqueror's efforts with the Domesday Book in 1086, because churchgoers believed that it was sacrilegious to carry out head counts. Setting another date for the census would raise serious questions about holding the general election four days later on May 3, which is currently thought to be the preferred date. The prime minister will have to make up his mind about a May 3 general election on around April 4 or 5. Moving the election date would delight Tory strategists who have been praying that events force the prime minister to abandon his hopes of calling the election almost four years to the day after his first election victory in 1997. The Tories hope that Mr Blair may not be able to maintain his momentum in the opinion polls and their fortunes will revive if the election is pushed into early summer or even the autumn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
