To quote the Reaction [beta] blog: Japanese artist Toshio Iwai and Yamaha have created a new digital instrument that can be played by anyone. The Tenori-On consists of a 16 x 16 matrix of LEDs that are sensitive to the musician's touch and can recognise simple physical gestures. For example, pushing one of the LEDs creates a ripple effect on the display and a rippling sound effect to match - and if the button is pushed long enough, the sound and light will loop repeatedly. Sounds like an interesting device, though I'd only be interested if it cost roughly a tenth of its current $999 \"New Holiday Price\". For those more interested in the singer, yesterday's Guardian had an interview with Little Boots, ie Victoria Hesketh: 'I've done so much embarrassing stuff it's untrue'."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
