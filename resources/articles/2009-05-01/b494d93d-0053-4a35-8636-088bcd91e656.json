The lethal denouement unfolds before our eyes, as the police, D'Angelo and we, the audience, stand by like onlookers at a crucifixion, helpless and hopeless, willing what we know will happen not to happen, hoping beyond hope that Wallace (Michael B Jordan) will escape the fate meted out to him by the gods of the game. But it is not to be, and in a gut-wrenching, heartbreaking scene, it is his two best friends, Bodie (JD Williams) and Poot (Tray Chaney), that dispatch him into the next life on the orders of Stringer Bell. Wallace's fate dominates not only this episode but has ramifications far and beyond for several characters. For D, it is the last straw as he can no longer resolve the conflict between serving his uncle and the cold, remorseless fatality of survival for Avon; for Daniels, who spends the episode running around with Jimmy trying to track Wallace down, a genuine sense of failure at protecting a child; for Bodie and Poot, their promotion from hoppers to murderers, gazing into the unwavering eye of the game, knowing what they are capable of, and what could easily happen to them. It is the tipping point for the two young 'uns, witnessing the harsh reality of even being thought of as a snitch \u2013 something that will eventually return to haunt Bodie. This underlines just how little else is on offer to these youngsters: why would you stay in the game after seeing that? Knowing you could be killed on the whims of your bosses, or end your days in prison? Because there is no other choice. They both know that to refuse would probably sign their own death warrants. D repeatedly tries to protect Wallace (\"Leave the boy be, Avon. Just leave him be\"), trying at first to hide his whereabouts, then trying to persuade the young hopper to go back to school, and finally, when the truth dawns on him, shouting \"where's Wallace?\" at Stringer from behind the jailhouse glass. His repeated, anguished cries echo as a clarion call for his defection from his uncle's affections. D goes his own way, and that way only tragedy lies. As has been noted many times on this blog, D is a far more influential character in this season on second viewing. He is pivotal to the fortunes of Avon and his clan, and Wallace is pivotal to his own fate. Two essentially decent boys thrust into a malicious, chaotic world that neither fully comprehends or enjoys. And for all Bodie's protestations that Wallace is just a boy, and should act like a man, acting like a father figure and looking after the kids in the house proves him to be twice the man of most of the players in the game. As for Bodie, he appears all too willing to take out his friend and prove his mettle to his bosses. As with so many characters in The Wire, somehow we end up not only forgiving him, but liking him, as the seasons unfold, but in this episode he represents the worst kind of snake, an amoral chancer who is only too happy to do Stringer's bidding. Ultimately it may be Poot who delivers the final shots, but he is the one who sheds the tears too. Running totals: Murders: up two to nine: as well as Wallace, the female security guard who identified D is killed, as Avon cleans up every possible lead to his organisation \u2013 partially on Levy's advice. Omar stick-ups: still on four \u2013 second week in absentia for the west side's modern-day highwayman. Herc fuck-ups: four-and-a-half still, but some brownie points to the knucklehead for gaining his sergeant's stripes (\"I'm gonna make Carv kiss the stripes, I swear to God, actually kiss them\"). McNulty: \"giving a fuck when it wasn't his turn\": steady at seven; trying to find Wallace definitely comes under his turn. Drunk: still six; a very action-focused episode leaves little time for setting the world to rights in bars, at the tracks or anywhere else. School of dubious parenting: still two. Bubbles's attempts to get clean: still on two; no sign of the show's conscience this week either."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
