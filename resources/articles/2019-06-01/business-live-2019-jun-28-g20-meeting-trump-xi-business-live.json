Key trade talks between President Trump and President Xi are scheduled for Saturday morning and traders and global leaders alike are hoping for a breakthrough. European markets have built on earlier gains and the STOXX 600 is up 0.4% at 383.77. The FTSE 100 is just 0.1% - or 9 points - higher at 7,411. In corporate news, Apple designer Jony Ive announced he was leaving the tech giant after 30 years to set up on his own. We\u2019ve looked at some of his hits and misses over the years, here: A consortium led by the family that controls the Lego toymaking empire agreed to buy the UK\u2019s Merlin Entertainments for \u00a35.9bn. Merlin\u2019s attractions include Legoland, Madame Tussauds waxworks and the London Eye. UK growth was confirmed at 0.5% for the first quarter of 2019, but economists warned a slowdown is likely in the second quarter. And eurozone inflation was stable at 1.2% in June, putting the European Central Bank on course to fulfil Mario Draghi\u2019s pledge to pump more stimulus into the economy. That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for commenting and have a great weekend. AM The opening bell has rung and US markets are higher. Dow Jones: +0.3% at 26,615 S&amp;P 500: +0.3% at 2,934 Nasdaq: +0.3% at 7,990 G20 leaders gathered in Osaka have voiced concerns over trade tensions. Reuters reports: The bitter US-China trade war and signs of slowdown in the global economy have overshadowed a two-day Group of 20 summit that kicked off in Osaka, western Japan, on Friday with a session on the world economy and trade. Yasutoshi Nishimura, Japan\u2019s deputy chief cabinet secretary, who was present at the meeting, said the G20 heads discussed ways to address common challenges such as promoting free trade and jump-starting stalled talks on reforming the WTO. \u201cThere are downside risks to the global economy as trade tensions escalate. Against this background, the G20 leaders agreed on the need for the group to drive global growth,\u201d Nishimura told reporters after the session on Friday. But that was as far as they could agree, as US President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d policies and aversion to multilateralism test the solidarity of the G20. Figures this morning confirmed the UK economy grew by 0.5% in the first quarter of 2019, following 0.2% growth in the final three months of 2019. But \u201cpayback\u201d is coming in the second quarter, according to Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the forecasting group, the EY Item Club: The UK economy has clearly suffered a serious slowdown since the first quarter and we suspect GDP could very well contract slightly in the second quarter. There has clearly been payback in the second quarter from the stockpiling that occurred in the first quarter while an additional hit came from car manufacturers bringing forward their summer shutdowns to April (to limit any disruptions should a disruptive Brexit have occurred at the end of March). Consumers have also clearly taken a breather in the second quarter after their first quarter splashing out The Item Club is forecasting that annual growth will slow to 1.3% in 2019, from 1.4% in 2018, before picking up to 1.5% in 2020. That forecast is based on the assumption that the UK leaves the EU on 31 October with a deal. Without a deal, the UK economy grows by just 0.3% in 2020... Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at currency firm Oanda, puts the latest bitcoin moves into context: The wild ride continues in the world of crypto, with bitcoin brushing off what would be a devastating 24 hours for any other asset, tumbling 25% in that time, to rebound more than 10% at the time of writing. I say this because this market moves so rapidly that it\u2019s probably out of date by the time I\u2019ve finished writing this sentence. When it comes to bitcoin, nothing surprises me so predicting whether we\u2019ll end the day back at new highs for the year or in the red is pointless. What is clear is that the Facebook story has re-energised the space in a remarkable way and reminded us of what we were seeing on a daily basis in late 2017. Suddenly $20,000 isn\u2019t looking too far away but as we learned early last year, $3,000 isn\u2019t either. The rollercoaster that is bitcoin\u2019s price graph continues, having climbed to almost $14,000 this week before lurching to just above $10,000 the next day. Bitcoin received a boost from the news that Facebook is launching is own digital currency, Libra, in 2020 but it hasn\u2019t brought an end to volatile trading. President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, has a chat with President Trump during the G20 summit in Osaka: But the biggest smiles were reserved for Turkey\u2019s President, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan: The mood among investors in Europe has picked up, as traders hope that progress will be made in Osaka tomorrow when the leaders of the world\u2019s two largest economies meet to discuss trade. The latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.3% at 7,425 Germany\u2019s DAX: 0.5% at 12,330 France\u2019s CAC: +0.3% at 5,508 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.3% at 21,170 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.3% at 9,175 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.3% at 383 Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, agrees the rise in core inflation will not deter Draghi and his colleagues on the ECB\u2019s governing council: The limited breakdown available shows that core inflation (excluding food, energy, alcohol and tobacco) rose from 0.8% in May to 1.1% in June. While Eurostat does not provide any further breakdown of services prices, the French statistical official attributed much of the increase there to higher transport prices, and state-level data suggest that much of the increase in German inflation was due to higher prices of package holidays and airfares, reflecting the larger number of public holidays in June this year. Much of this may be reversed in July. None of this changes the big picture, which is that underlying price pressures remain well below the ECB\u2019s near-2% target. With the eurozone economy having slowed again in Q2, and business surveys still soft, we think core inflation will remain close to 1% for the foreseeable future. The ECB governing council will therefore signal in late-July that further policy easing is on the way. Although the headline rate of eurozone inflation was steady at 1.2%, core inflation - stripping out volatile energy and food prices - rose to 1.1% in June from 0.8% in May. However, economists said the rise in core inflation will not deter Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, who dropped heavy hints last week that ECB policymakers are ready to pump fresh stimulus into the eurozone economy. Bert Colijn, senior eurozone economist at the Dutch bank ING: Core inflation has been bouncing around on Easter timing effects and the recovery from 0.8 to 1.1% should more realistically reflect the current underlying inflation environment. Even though wage growth continues to increase at a steady pace, reflecting the improved labour market environment, businesses continue to be reluctant to price through those higher costs to the consumer. The inflation outlook therefore remains sluggish. With energy base effects pushing down the outlook for the coming months, headline inflation will continue to face downward pressures. On top of that, businesses have indicated softer expectations for selling prices on the back of economic uncertainty. The improved core inflation figure will therefore be easily brushed aside in the discussions about fresh ECB action: it\u2019s coming. The eurozone\u2019s annual inflation rate was 1.2% in June, unchanged from May, according to the \u201cflash\u201d estimate from statistics agency Eurostat. The main drivers of inflation were food, alcohol and tobacco, energy and services: Much has been made of the impact of Brexit uncertainty on business investment, as firms delay or redirect spending plans until the picture is clearer. Some good news then in the ONS figures, which showed business investment increased by 0.4% in the first quarter of 2019, compared with the fourth quarter of 2018, to \u00a346.9bn. The biggest contributor to growth was investment in \u201cbuildings and structures\u201d, as well as intellectual property. The rise followed four consecutive quarters of declining business investment. It was still down by 1.5% on an annual basis however. A breakdown of the UK growth figures shows there were some revisions in the detail since the first estimate. Growth in the services sector was revised up to 0.4% from 0.3%, while construction output was revised up to 1.4% from 1%. Production on the other hand was revised down in the second estimate, to 1% growth from 1.4% in the first estimate. All in all it left the headline rate of quarterly growth at 0.5% in Q1. The second estimate of UK growth in the first quarter is out and there the headline numbers are unchanged. The economy grew by 0.5% compared with the previous quarter, and by 1.8% year-on-year according to the Office for National Statistics. Here is a summary from Rob Kent-Smith at the ONS: GDP grew solidly and was unrevised in the first quarter of 2019, with manufacturing seeing strong growth due to orders being brought forward ahead of the UK\u2019s original EU departure date. Household saving has been historically low for 18 months, following a marked drop off in non-pension saving in recent years. A consortium led by the family that controls the Lego toymaking empire is to buy Merlin Entertainments for \u00a35.9bn. The FTSE 250 Merlin counts Legoland, Madame Tussauds waxworks and the London Eye among its assets and shares are up 14% this morning after the deal was announced. Read our full story here: Away from Japan, there have been some major developments in the corporate world. One of the most striking headlines this morning is the decision by Sir Jony Ive, the Apple designer behind the iPhone, to leave the company. Once described by Apple\u2019s founder, the late Steve Jobs, as his \u201cspiritual partner\u201d, Ive\u2019s decision to quit and set up his own firm wiped almost $13bn off the market value of the US tech giant in after-hours trading. The 52-year-old Briton told the FT: While I will not be an employee, I will still be very involved \u2013 I hope for many, many years to come. This just seems like a natural and gentle time to make this change. Over in Osaka, the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, struck an upbeat tone after meeting world leaders. The IMF warned earlier this month that the the tit-for-tat tariffs between the US and China would cost $455bn (\u00a3357.5bn) in lost output next year. Trading in Europe has got off to a fairly quiet start as investors pause to weigh up the potential risks and rewards from tomorrow\u2019s meeting between Trump and Xi: FTSE 100: +0.1% at 7,408 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.5% at 12,326 France\u2019s CAC: +0.1% at 5,499 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.1% at 21,093 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.2% at 9,129 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.1% at 383 Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, says that any trade war truce struck between the US and China at the G20 is likely to be short-lived: Trump and Xi will meet tomorrow and may agree to hold off imposing new tariffs for the time being. While this would be a positive outcome for China\u2019s economy and markets in the short-run, any gains will probably prove fleeting with a renewed escalation in trade tensions still likely further down the road. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The meeting of G20 leaders is underway in Osaka, Japan, and there is one question on investor minds: will the meeting between President Trump and President Xi break the deadlock on trade between the US and China? Investors across Asia are clearly not convinced, with markets down across the board. The Shanghai composite and Japan\u2019s Nikkei were both down 0.6%. The lack of optimism was partly fuelled by comments by the US President ahead of the crunch talks, due to take place on Saturday morning. Trump suggested China would be keen to do a deal because its economy was \u201cgoing down the tubes\u201d. Han Tan, market analyst at FXTM, captures the mood among investors: This weekend, markets will find out whether their hopes for a restoration in US-China trade talks will become reality, and whether the scope for further deterioration in bilateral relations would be significantly constrained. It remains to be seen whether the public displays of chest-thumping from both sides since May will eventually lead to handshakes and smiles on Saturday. Such a reconciliatory image out of the Trump-Xi meeting is expected to send relief signals coursing through the veins of the markets, potentially boosting global equities and emerging-market assets. Still, the prudent investor would be well aware that the road ahead isn\u2019t all plain sailing, given the tremendous gulf that still remains between both governments, with tit-for-tat tariffs still in place. As long as the prospects of more trade tariffs loom large over the horizon, risk aversion should continue having a major say on market sentiment.
