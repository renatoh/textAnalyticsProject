Even my builder\u2019s thrilled\u2019", "bodyText": "Gabby Logan knew things would be different for this World Cup when her builder started discussing the matches with her, play by play. Unlike some of the responses she had the last time around, he didn\u2019t qualify his remarks by saying the performances were \u201cgood \u2026 for women\u2019s football\u201d or question the quality of the games. \u201cHe was just thrilled by it and enjoying the tournament,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the thing, it\u2019s the same game, with the same goalposts \u2013 I don\u2019t know where the debate came about that the goals were smaller \u2013 and you can get into it quickly. You\u2019re not introducing audiences to an entirely new sport, it\u2019s not chairball. It\u2019s football! When they watch it, they realise..\u201d Logan is enjoying a triumphant run anchoring the BBC\u2019s coverage of the Fifa World Cup in France as its trusted voice and experience on the ground. It\u2019s her sixth World Cup but the first in which the women\u2019s game has been treated with anywhere near the seriousness afforded the men\u2019s; the BBC has committed to showing every game, of the tournament across its channels and the red button, with care made to show viewers back stories for the participating teams. \u201cIt\u2019s a tanker to turn and it takes time \u2026 but it was about a year ago that [the BBC] said they wanted to broadcast every match. It normalises the game; it was never going to be tokenistic.\u201d Deftly negotiating tapas at her local in Beaconsfield, Logan is as poised and polished as she is on screen. \u201cThey weren\u2019t going to put these matches on for small audiences,\u201d she explains. \u201cYou can\u2019t put something on without any knowledge that there\u2019s an appetite for it, and the audience have pleasantly surprised us \u2013 they\u2019ve been bigger than we hoped.\u201d England\u2019s win over Scotland set a record in the UK for women\u2019s football, with 6 million viewers; this is expected to climb for the team\u2019s much-anticipated last-16 game against Cameroon today. Logan is warm but has a no-nonsense efficiency; by her own admission, she can be brusque, gets frustrated by tardiness and slackness and lightly eye-rolls men on Twitter who see fit to comment on what she\u2019s wearing on TV. \u201cI just think, \u2018Ugh, you can\u2019t take on all that\u2019. I don\u2019t feel I\u2019ve ever traded on looks in my career. [But] I do think it\u2019s important [presenters] appear on screen looking like we dressed properly; you want to feel groomed but not distracting and it\u2019s about respect \u2013 I turn up in your living room.\u201d When she came up in the 90s, working first at Sky Sports and later at ITV, Logan felt less at ease negotiating the sexism that came with the job. \u201cI was fortunate to have worked at the right time, the universe was ready to see women talk about sport \u2026 looking back, there were hard things because, of course, people said things that were unacceptable and of course they did things that were unacceptable.\u201d She pauses but won\u2019t elaborate. \u201cBut the thing I found hard was retaining my sense of being a woman and trying not to morph into [the men] to get on.\u201d At the height of ladette culture, Logan says she was frequently offered men\u2019s magazines covers and felt anxious about not taking that route or \u201cbeing pretty enough to be a broadcaster\u201d but was determined to ride it out. \u201cI remember consciously thinking to myself, \u2018This phase will pass and I have to stay true to myself\u2019. I wasn\u2019t interested in drinking 10 pints and being in that world. I liked being a woman and I l liked sport; I just had to wait until that was acceptable.\u201d Now, she says, she is content. Her twins, Lois and Reuben, are almost 14 and she and her husband, the former Scottish rugby union player Kenny Logan, spend much of their weekends ferrying their children around to compete in sports. \u201cI said to my husband recently that we should have had another baby and he laughed and asked how we\u2019d divide even more of our time between them.\u201d Logan is one of four siblings; her younger brother died when she was 19 and he was 15. She talks openly about the strain her family suffered With her own children, she\u2019s determined to make the most of their time together as a unit \u201cbefore they move out and leave\u201d and is chief organiser of family time. Mostly, she hopes she and Kenny have instilled \u201ca strong work ethic\u201d in them both. \u201cMy kids are funny, they\u2019ll turn around and ask: \u2018Are you sure we don\u2019t have trust funds?\u2019 And I\u2019ll say: \u2018Yep, I\u2019m positive yes, where have you heard this form?\u2019. Who talks about trust funds?!\u201d. Logan is all about hard graft: since 2007, she has been a key element of the BBC\u2019s presenting team, deputising for Gary Lineker on Match of the Day and anchoring the athletics and rugby coverage. This month, Amazon Prime announced it had won the rights to show 20 Premier League matches in the coming season and will be assembling a new presenting team; could she be tempted by an offer? \u201cYou\u2019ve got to feel valued,\u201d she says diplomatically, \u201cand realise market forces are at play but I\u2019m doing jobs I love and my opinions are taken seriously and I have an influence on the people I work with; I\u2019ve done the hours.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
