The boy, Jeremy Mardis, died on Tuesday night after police shot into a car driven by his father, Chris Few. On Thursday, Colonel Michael Edmonson, head of the Louisiana state police, denied earlier reports that Few had been reversing his car toward the officers, who then had to defend themselves. \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t say that,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThat didn\u2019t come from me.\u201d At a press conference, Edmonson initially described the shooting as \u201can exchange of gunfire\u201d, but later clarified that only the officers had shot, and that investigators had found no gun in Few\u2019s car. Officials had previously declined to confirm whether officer gunfire was responsible for Mardis\u2019s death. Edmonson also said video footage of the incident does exist, but that investigators have not reviewed it. He added that the officers involved \u2013 there are four \u2013 had so far refused to speak with state police investigators. Police have not released the names of the involved officers. Asked by the Guardian what reason they offered for their silence, Edmonson said: \u201cYou\u2019d have to ask them. We are trying to talk with them.\u201d At least one of the shooters was a Marksville police officer who was moonlighting for the city marshal\u2019s office, an agency responsible for serving court papers . But according to Marksville\u2019s mayor, John Lemoine, city marshal Floyd Voinche and his officers have recently begun overstepping their authority. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he felt the need to start patrolling in city limits,\u201d Lemoine said Thursday of Voinche. \u201cIt makes no sense to me.\u201d The Guardian could not reach Voinche for comment before press time. Edmonson, the state police head, said his investigators started gathering evidence the night of the shooting, attempting to reconstruct what happened without the cooperation of the officers involved. Orange spray paint marks the orientation of Few\u2019s car and three patrol cars, at the intersection of Taensas Street and Martin Luther King Drive. The particular placement of the cars \u2013 and a spray of glass from the passenger\u2019s side of Few\u2019s car \u2013 seems to indicate Few was not backing toward the officers. His car was perpendicular to them, and the officers\u2019 shots hit the driver\u2019s side broadside. Avoyolles Parish coroner LJ Mayeux said Mardis was killed by multiple gunshot wounds to the head and torso. He died at the scene. His father, Few, is in serious condition at Rapides Hospital in Alexandria, Louisiana. Few\u2019s fiancee, Megan Dixon, said the entire tragedy started with a romantic dispute. Earlier on Tuesday night, she said, she and Few had bickered at TJ\u2019s pool hall, and she had left with a friend named Sally. Few also left, and picked up his son at a relative\u2019s house. A short while later, Few pulled up next to Dixon at a stop light \u2013 Marksville is a small town \u2013 and tried to get her to come home with him. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m stubborn.\u201d Moments later, she said, as the cars pulled away from the light, she saw two marshals\u2019 cars \u2013 marked in black and white \u2013 approaching from behind with their lights flashing. She looked into Few\u2019s car as he pulled away, and he was pointing at his son\u2019s head, indicating that he was in the car and he wasn\u2019t sure what to do. Few was afraid of the marshals, she said, because he and and one of the marshals on the scene had a prior personal conflict."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
