If psychology has anything to do with the approach to this afternoon's Second Division play-off, the first thing Ian Holloway must do is persuade his team to snap out of their aversion to the concept of winner-takes-all. It's two-and-a-half seasons since QPR last won a cup match of any kind. FA Cup, Worthington Cup, LDV Vans trophy, you name it, Rangers have crashed out of each and every challenge in the first round. This season, they really proved themselves the masters of the do-or-die cock-up by losing to Vauxhall Motors in the FA Cup. It prompted Holloway to wonder if his players were 'on another planet'. Today they occupy another stratosphere altogether. QPR's ragbag team, a compilation of old stalwarts, fresh-faced kids, and astutely selected loan players, are one game away from getting out of the Second Division at the second attempt. Slipping into it two summers ago marked the club's darkest hour in living memory. Not only did they find themselves in a division they had looked down upon for the best part of 30 years, they were also in administration, with money, status and faith plummeting by the day. To give their plunging fortunes perspective, 10 years ago, in the first season of the Premiership, QPR finished fifth - top London club - above Arsenal, Chelsea and the rest. It is at this bleakest point that Holloway dived headlong, with typical effervescence, into what appeared an impossible job. The regeneration he has inspired is one of the most uplifting stories in the Nationwide. Having come out of administration just over a year ago and spent buttons, they are clear of debts, well supported (their average crowd of 13,200 is the division's highest), and possess a squad with a thriving team spirit who are capable of playing neat football. No question, though, should they gain promotion they will need to bolster the squad to hold their own next season. What chance 'Sir Les' Ferdinand coming back to the club where he began his career? It has been a mixed campaign. After a decent start, QPR went nine games without a win, the low point being a 4-0 capitulation to today's opponents at Loftus Road). A late-season revival saw them forge their way to a creditable fourth-place finish. And so an estimated 30,000 followers of the Super Hoops journey cheerfully down the M4 today to take on Cardiff City at the 'neutral' venue of the Millennium Stadium. Unfortunately, they are without the presence of their talismanic goalscoring midfielder Richard Langley (suspended). In his absence, they will look to the enigmatic Kevin Gallen to lead the charge alongside Paul Furlong, the much maligned journeyman who won the respect of the Rangers faithful with his late goal to see off Oldham in the semi-final. (Does that count as a cup game?) Holloway was so delirious he made an emotional microphone address to the crowd from the middle of the pitch, pledging to win the final and bellowing: 'This is a proper football club!' Presumably he was referring to their tradition. Indeed, times may be troubled, but, as season-ticket-holder Peter Lawrence said: 'We still reminisce about the good old days of Stan Bowles, Rodney Marsh, and even Roy Wegerle.' Paying homage to better days, QPR have jettisoned their usual away kit to play in an all-white strip, as worn by Marsh's League Cup winning team of 1967. Holloway is predictably upbeat: 'I believe what comes around goes around and this club has had so many downs recently it might be our turn.' Team news Cardiff City v QPR 3pm, today, Sky Sports 1 Cardiff are at full-strength, Rhys Weston having recovered from the calf injury that forced him out of the second leg semi at Bristol City.
