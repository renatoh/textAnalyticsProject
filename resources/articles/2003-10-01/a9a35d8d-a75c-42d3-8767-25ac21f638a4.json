Following high profile criticism from Germans - including the country's president, Johannes Rau - that the British history curriculum is disproportionately focused on the Third Reich, Mr Clarke met with his German counterpart Edelgard Buhlmahn in the same hotel in Bonn where Neville Chamberlain infamously met with Adolf Hitler in 1938. Mr Clarke said he accepted the criticisms, but insisted that Hitler would retain his place on the curriculum. He told The Times: \"Do I think there is a systematic distortion through the national curriculum of German history designed to misrepresent modern Germany? No I don't.\" However, he accepted that the German education minister was making a \"fair point\", and added that he was \"keen to get an appreciation of modern Germany, indeed of other modern European countries,\" into the curriculum. The meeting was organised by the German ambassador to London, Thomas Mattusek, and his British counterpart in Germany. Mr Mattusek, who has been campaigning on this issue for some time, told EducationGuardian.co.uk: \"Germany's reputation has gone form bad to worse. \"One reason is that young people learn less and less about modern day Germany. We had cases of young Germans getting beaten up here and headmasters at the German school encouraging pupils [visiting Britain] to speak English so as not to attract attention.\" He said he welcomed Mr Clarke's interest in the subject, and added: \"It is not just in Germany's interest, but in Britain's interest as well. The government must want the future elite to understand what is going on in the modern world.\" Professor Norman Davies, former school teacher and now a professor of history at Oxford University said: \"Hitler and all that goes with him is by far the most common subject that people remember at the end of their course. Admissions tutors regularly complain that they get bright applicants who can only talk about Hitler. \"Schoolchildren's views of Germany are distorted. Hitler was only in power for 12 years - less than one generation. Most British schoolchildren don't know about anything else. Hitler can be their one big dose of foreign history,\" he added. \"Pupils get this idea that foreign history is full of horrible things and I don't think it's particularly healthy that that should happen.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
