Broadly speaking, there are three routes open to you depending on how you like to learn. Within the range of qualifications there will be something to suit most people. If you like academic, paper-based learning, then A-levels, an International Baccalaureate (or a Welsh bacc if you're in Wales) or the Cambridge Pre-U might be for you. If you prefer a mix of hands-on learning and theory then the new diploma, or the tried and tested BTec (Business and Technology Education Council) might prove better options, and can always be combined with A-levels. However, it's worth noting that ministers warned in April thousands of City &amp; Guilds, BTecs and national vocational qualifications (NVQs) could be scrapped or absorbed into the new diplomas. If you want to train for a specific job, an apprenticeship or an NVQ might be your best bet - and they still leave open the option of university if you decide later that you want to take a degree. As far as entry requirements go, for A-levels it's fairly straightforward \u2013 you will need at least four GCSEs at grade A to C - but with these and most other qualifications you need to check with your school or college what they expect. If you're interested in a particular course or subject, you could also go to the exam boards (listed below) and check the entry requirements with them. A-levels These are still the best option if you like paper-based learning and you've got the required grades to take them. From September, the structure of A-levels will be changing. Instead of six modules, you'll study only four in more depth. Exams are taken at the end of each module, which count towards your final mark and can be retaken. There'll be more extended essays for you to write and you'll be expected to make connections between different aspects of the subjects. In the exams there will be more open-ended questions and you'll be able to earn a new A* if you're one of the top performers. The first A* grades will be awarded in 2010. You also have the option of doing an extended project, if you want to look into a particular subject and do some independent research. The project will be worth half an A-level and might help you stand out from the crowd if you decide to apply to university. There are also applied A-levels, which are A-levels taken in more vocational subjects, such as leisure and tourism. But these are being slowly phased out and will be available only until diplomas are offered in all subjects across the country (expected to be 2011). If you live in Scotland, you'll be able to take Scottish Highers and Advanced Highers, which are the equivalent of A-levels. AS-levels If you pass your first year of A-level and decide not to continue with your studies you will be awarded an AS-level. AS-levels are a good opportunity to try out a subject and get a qualification even if you decide not to carry on to A-level. And there are more than 70 AS-levels to choose from. Cambridge Pre-U Diploma Some schools are offering this new qualification from the University of Cambridge, which is supposed to be tougher than A-levels and make it easier for universities to distinguish between the best candidates. It's mostly private schools that are giving students the chance to take this qualification instead of A-levels but 15 state schools have signed up so far, so you will need to check whether it's something your school is offering. For the CPU, you take at least three \"principal\" subjects from a choice of 26. Instead of taking exams at the end of each module, you'll take exams at the end of the two-year course. You'll be expected to write more essays and there will be no retakes. Alongside your chosen subjects, you'll have to complete an independent research report and a \"global perspectives portfolio\". Through a series of seminars based on themes - practical ethics, economics, environment, technology, and politics and culture \u2013 you'll build up a portfolio of work including audio-visual and web-based presentations and develop detailed research proposals. The portfolio and research report can be taken as stand-alone qualifications, alongside A-levels, which could make your application stand out when applying for university. The CPU has been approved by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, although Ucas has yet to reveal what it is worth, compared with A-levels. International Baccalaureate This worldwide qualification is offered mostly by private schools. You will take six subjects - three at a standard level and three at a higher level over two years. You'll have some choice over subjects but the idea is to give a rounded education so you have to continue with English, a second language, a science, maths, arts and humanities. Full marks in the IB are equivalent to more than seven A-grade A-levels. Welsh baccalaureate This is a diploma on three levels for 14 to 19-year-olds. But at the post-16 advanced level, you'd take two or more A-levels plus an advanced core module. The core at level 3 is worth 120 Ucas points, equivalent to an A-level grade A. Diplomas The first five of these new qualifications will be taught from September, although eventually, by 2011, there will be 17 of them to choose from. The first five are in: engineering, construction, information technology, creative and media, society, health and development Diplomas are a mixture of classroom learning and practical experience that should qualify you to go into a mixture of skilled jobs or on to university if you choose. There are three different levels of diploma: foundation (level 1), higher (level 2) and advanced (level 3). Assuming you've got your GCSEs, you'll be heading for an advanced diploma. In which case, you'll do an extended project \u2013 which will mean doing research into an area of your subject that you're particularly interested in and writing about it \u2013 as well as taking an A-level or equivalent qualifications. The government has put together a catalogue of possible qualifications you could take to make up your diploma. All the diplomas will be made up of three parts: principal learning; generic learning and additional specialist learning. Principal learning \u2013 you'll study qualifications developed for the diploma in your chosen subject, eg engineering, and undertake a project in this area. Generic learning \u2013 this is where you'll learn \"functional skills\" such as English, maths and ICT and develop skills to help make you more employable, such as presentation, communication and teamworking. You'll also have to do 10 days work experience, ideally in a field related to your diploma subject, so if you're taking the engineering diploma, this could mean seeing how an architect works. Additional specialist learning \u2013 this is where you specialise in some aspect of your subject and learn more of the academic theory behind it. You will have to complete an extended project and take an A-level or equivalent in a related subject. For example, you could take an A-level in art if you're taking the creative diploma, or two AS-levels or a BTec. How demanding each element of the diploma will be will depend on which level you're taking. BTec These are vocational qualifications that prepare you to go into work or higher education. There are three types of qualification all at Level 3 (equivalent to A-level): the BTec National Award; BTec National Certificate and BTec National Diploma. The 6-unit National Award is a specialist qualification that focuses on particular aspects of your chosen subject. It is broadly equivalent to one A-level and is graded pass, merit or distinction. The 12-unit National Certificate is more specialised and you can choose what area of your chosen subject to focus on. It is broadly equivalent to two A-levels. The 18-unit BTec National Diploma extends and deepens your understanding of your chosen area of study and prepares you for work in this field. It is broadly equivalent to three A-levels. Apprenticeships If you're not keen on a traditional, academic approach to learning and prefer a more hands-on approach, an apprenticeship might be a good option. It's also a good idea if you know what career you want to go into, but would still like to keep the option of university open as you can go on to take a foundation degree fairly easily after completing an apprenticeship. You will be based with a company, learning the job on the ground, but will have days off to study at college. The work/study split will be decided between you and your employer. Alternatively, you could do a programme-led apprenticeship (PLA), where you spend a year or so in college learning theory and key skills before you go to an employer for on-the-job training to get a an NVQ qualification. To apply for an apprenticeship you can approach an employer directly about the possibility of taking you on or call the national Apprenticeships hotline on 08000 150 600, which will then be able to put you in touch with local employers and training centres. For more information on your options, you could visit the Connexions Direct website: http://www.connexions-direct.com/itsyourchoice/choiceisyours/ City &amp; Guilds City &amp; Guilds also offer vocational qualifications. There are more than 400 subjects to choose from. NVQs For those who are not keen on continuing studying after 16, and decide to get a job, you can still gain qualifications for the work you do through an NVQ. NVQs assess the skills that candidates demonstrate at work and are available at five levels, from level 1 - for routine jobs - to level 5 - for jobs with complex tasks and substantial responsibility: For more information on your options from 14-19, click here.
