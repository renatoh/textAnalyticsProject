It was in February 2001 that Sven-Goran Eriksson started work in earnest with England by beating Spain at Villa Park, the same ground where they will meet Holland in tonight's friendly. Four years on, the Swede was bound to review the progress already made and the prospects for the time he has left in the job. His own opportunities with England are narrowing because he is expected to stand down after the 2006 World Cup finals in Germany. He is conscious that it is an advantage to have the tournament played on European soil. \"I think we can win it,\" he said before restating his determination that the squad must be allowed to prepare as thoroughly as their rivals. The manager believes that he will enjoy a four-week gap from the end of the domestic season, even though that raises the possibility of the FA Cup final going ahead in midweek. \"I know the Cup final is a big tradition and I hope this can be resolved,\" he said. \"I understand it's not the best for the fans to go to Wembley or Cardiff on a Wednesday. \"But four weeks is very important. All the other countries have that. What I know is that the biggest thing in the career of a footballer is the World Cup. You can't do anything bigger than that, with all respect to the FA Cup, the Premier League and the Champions League. \"We are the only [major] country in Europe without a winter break. That's a big handicap for our players at the end of the season. Our chances are less if we don't have four weeks.\" The selection of men he will take to Germany, with qualification close to being assured, matters as much as their condition. Eriksson intends to study the debuts of Stewart Downing and Andy Johnson this evening. He promises them 45 minutes of involvement and they will be introduced for the second half. The more immediate significance for England, though, lies in Shaun Wright-Phillips's first start for his country and the role in which he will be deployed. Eriksson says he will be at \"outside right\". In effect this means he will be in advance of David Beckham in a 4-3-3 formation when England are on the attack. It seems that the manager plans to imitate Chelsea, though, by having the supplementary strikers, Wright-Phillips and Wayne Rooney, drop back when the opposition have the ball. Apart from being fashionable, the system allows Eriksson, almost uniquely, to put everyone in their normal position. Rooney towards the left? \"He plays there most of the time for Manchester United,\" the manager said. Frank Lampard towards that flank in a three-man midfield unit? \"He will be exactly where he plays for Chelsea.\" The touches of wing play on the outside of Lampard would therefore come from an overlapping Ashley Cole. \"He is one of the best left-backs in the world,\" Eriksson said. \"He has everything: he can defend very well, he has pace, he is attacking all the time, he can score and he hits good crosses.\" England's players and Eriksson's exciting tactical arrangements might all inspire keen anticipation were it not for their pitiful display in the last outing, the 1-0 defeat by Spain in November's friendly. The formation may suit his players but that will be of no avail if it is also to the liking of the Holland team that the coach Marco van Basten is reshaping. Eriksson's two previous meetings with the Dutch have brought a defeat and a draw. It would be healthy for England to dominate this evening and, in particular, for Beckham to give the sort of display that would spare the manager the nuisance of having to insist that the midfielder still deserves automatic selection. Beckham has at least been seen in a better light since Real Madrid started to mount a strong recovery under their new coach Wanderley Luxemburgo. \"He has had bigger nights than a friendly with Holland,\" Eriksson said of his captain, \"but I am sure he wants to demonstrate that he is not finished as a football player. And of course he is not.\" So long as Steven Gerrard has the discipline to hang back and protect the makeshift centre-half pairing of Jamie Carragher and Wes Brown, there could be a basis for men such as Beckham and Wright-Phillips to ensure that England excel."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
