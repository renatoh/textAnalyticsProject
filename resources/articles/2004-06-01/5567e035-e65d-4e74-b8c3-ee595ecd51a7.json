More importantly, what are the legal implications? The first issue is the contract between the parties involved. Beyond the public rules of the Big Brother house, for example, there are detailed personal contracts, among others, between the production company and the housemates. The contestants should also have been carefully vetted to ensure they do not have known hidden (as opposed to obvious) antisocial tendencies and that they seem able to cope with the strains of becoming public property. To this end, the rules expressly permit any housemate to leave the house at any time. Even so, all event participants need to be carefully monitored for signs of strain that could spell health risks (for themselves or others). There are several important legal principles here. One is that a person can expressly or implicitly consent to run the risk of injury; another is that no one is permitted to exclude liability for their own negligence where this causes personal injury or death. Rugby players, for example, consent to the risk of being accidentally injured but not to run the risk of injury from the serious negligence of another player. Moreover, since referees have been held liable for negligence in permitting an inexperienced player into the front row of a scrum that has collapsed, programme directors must be alert to foreseeable risks between participants, and they cannot necessarily avoid such claims by an exclusion clause in the contract. Likewise, housemates will be expected to anticipate a predictable level of pressure, and not to claim foul for that pressure on its own. But if the rules are changed, and they suffer injury as a result, someone may be liable for damages. For example, the male contestants in There's Something About Miriam agreed to compete on air for the affections of a woman. When they subsequently discovered that the \"something\" in question was unreconstructed male genitalia, they were furious and made claims against the producers, including breach of contract and defamation. Our new laws against discriminating on grounds of sexual orientation do not (yet) seem to require us to accept a man as a woman, however amusing it may be to the audience. Damages may be more difficult to establish, but in this instance the threat was enough to extract an apology and a payout to the hapless Romeos. Gordon Ramsay may make great television viewing but he is not a role model for employers. Managers following his example would soon provoke constructive dismissal claims from employees for abuse and failure to follow proper disciplinary procedures. Hell's Kitchen has another challenge to face in dealing with celebrities, who may have a better expectation of the effects of publicity but a bigger claim for loss of reputation if things go wrong. It also needs to be remembered that the higher the potential prize, the higher the potential damages for unfair exclusion or deprivation of the chance to win. But what about privacy? The contestants' voluntary submission to intrusion seems to disallow any expectation of privacy, but the Naomi Campbell appeal decision suggests that if humiliating sequences are shown outside the expectation of those involved, or obtained covertly, claims may still stand for unjustified publication of highly personal information. Logically, more \"extreme\" characters would be less likely to succeed in a claim that their human dignity has been infringed. The Data Protection Act is also applicable in relation to the processed pictures if consent (or explicit consent in sensitive personal issues) is not obtained to the actual processing. Here again the contract will be the touchstone, setting down the parties' respective rights and obligations. The production team must also be careful not to make comments inducing the participants to sign up that could be construed as \"representations\", which in some cases might overrule the terms of the written contract. Then there are the obligations that contestants owe to one another, although with the degree of analysis that often follows evictions from Big Brother it is sometimes difficult to see that these obligations go beyond newsworthy backbiting. Defamation law still applies, so it would be as well for those involved not to impugn the original professional skills (as opposed to the culinary skills) of their housemates or fellow chefs. Confidentiality might apply to things said outside the public view and hearing, but again it would be an uphill job to establish the duty. And the same issue of negligence can arise if participants do something which is in breach of their duty of care to the others, judged in the context of the event in question. Even so, the TV or production company would usually be a bigger target for a claim than another contestant. Whether Orwell would regard the modern Big Brother (or Big Chef) as a greater threat to human dignity than his original must remain unanswered. Reality truth can be stranger than fiction. \u00b7 Charles Boundy is a partner at Fladgate Fielder solicitors"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
