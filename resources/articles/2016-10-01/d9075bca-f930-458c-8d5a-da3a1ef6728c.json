Having spent the tense final stages of the game talking away happily with a stranger beside him, 64-year-old Rob McCarthy had to be administered CPR by nearby fans until the arrival of official paramedics at the MCG. According to an ABC report, McCarthy\u2019s first words upon his resuscitation were, \u201cDid the Doggies win?\u201d The episode has been chronicled in remarkable detail on The Footy Almanac website by Essendon supporter Jim Ingram, who was sitting next to McCarthy when near-disaster struck. At three-quarter time of the game, Ingram said, McCarthy \u201clooked at me and, pumping his chest with his fist, he joked, \u2018they\u2019d wanna have an ambo parked out the front if we get up\u2019. I laughed, pointed at him and openly joked, \u2018don\u2019t you go dying on me mate\u2019.\u201d But the warning proved prophetic. With 10 minutes to play in the game and the Bulldogs firming as favourites to complete their fairytale premiership after a 62-year wait, McCarthy \u201cstiffened in his seat\u201d and suffered a heart attack, before off-duty paramedic and Richmond fan Liam Moore arrived from a nearby seat and started administering CPR. \u201cHe had a weak pulse at that stage but that quickly disappeared so we got someone to get him down on the ground and we started CPR,\u201d Moore told Ambulance Victoria. \u201cWhen I got there he still had a pulse so I knew we had a chance.\u201d As the siren sounded and the Bulldogs\u2019 team song started playing, according to Ingram, there was an eerie sight: \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t watched it with my own eyes, I\u2019d call it too perfect to be true,\u201d Ingram said, \u201cbut I noticed the rhythm of the man administering CPR was in perfect timing to the beat of the Bulldog\u2019s song.\u201d With the arrival of the ground\u2019s official paramedics, McCarthy was soon revived, sitting upright and gingerly joining in celebrations for his long-suffering team, but if it wasn\u2019t for the presence of a defibrillator nearby and live-saving surgery in the aftermath, the story might been far worse for the Dogs fan. McCarthy has since received treatment at the Epworth Hospital, where he was reunited with the men and women who helped save his life. \u201cI wanted to see Liam and they all saved my life. It\u2019s emotional, I can\u2019t describe it. It\u2019s phenomenal,\u201d he told Ambulance Victoria. \u201cI am a very lucky guy and I love them all.\u201d At the very least, both McCarthy and the man sitting next to him have a truly unique story to tell of being there on the Dogs\u2019 momentous day. \u201cWhen Rob finally sat up from the concrete, blinked and looked around, the almighty roar that erupted from within our small group was something to behold. If the \u2018G had a roof, it would\u2019ve been blown clean off,\u201d Ingram said. \u201cAs the song goes, \u2018you can\u2019t beat the boys of the Bulldogs breed,\u2019 and Rob is living proof.\u201d A Facebook post by McCarthy\u2019s daughter Bec Ross, sent to the official Melbourne Cricket Ground page, has since gone viral, attracting over 8,100 likes. \u201cWant to thank the staff at the MCG in particular the AFL doctor who saved my father\u2019s life today and travelled in the ambulance with him,\u201d it said. \u201cThanks to the patrons and staff\u2019s quick thinking he was brought back to life and is going to be okay. Thank you so much. Go doggies!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
