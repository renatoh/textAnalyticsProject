More than opposable thumbs and the invention of the flinthead axe, it was our ability to transcend the quotidian by weaving tales of awe and wonder that set us apart from the beasts. Some people, however, are bent on abusing this extraordinary advantage, and JJ Abrams is one of them. His 24-part, prime-time series began well - a plane crashes on a deserted island and 48 beautiful people of all nationalities survive with only picturesque injuries. Add to this Benettonesque line-up a mysterious beast in the jungle, a transmission coming from who-knows-where and some ancient corpses and the stage was set for a multilayered and intriguing story (were they in purgatory? The Bermuda triangle? A survivor's dream?) that could go anywhere. In the event, it went everywhere and nowhere. The first few flashbacks into the protagonists' pasts were fun, but hardly innovative (the rock star's a drug addict! Jack's daddy died!). When it emerged that everyone was going to be backstoried and motivated to death, a faint weariness crept over the audience, exacerbated by the fact that on the island itself, there was plenty going on but nothing you could honestly call gripping. Factions formed but no Lord of the Flies moments arose. Jack followed a hallucination of his father into the forest, but was vouchsafed no life-altering knowledge. The team found a dead polar bear but discussing the implications of an Arctic animal on a tropical island must wait because Kate and Jack must smoulder together for a network-mandated 17 minutes per episode. The problem is - ironically, at a time when we are lamenting the dominance of narrative-free reality shows - an overabundance of plot, which has led to a dearth of characterisation. The cast is too big for them to be painted in anything but broad strokes and the audience's attention is too thinly spread to allow any relationship to develop that might add depth. It is, in short, a sprawling and unsatisfactory mess with no resolution in sight. It's not teasing the audience, it's senselessly fragmented. It's not resurrecting the art of deferred gratification, it has entirely lost its way. It is, in short, over."}, "isHosted": false}}}
