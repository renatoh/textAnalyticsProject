The Turin-based car manufacturers, who own Ferrari, issued a statement yesterday saying that the parties were \"in the process of setting up in the Netherlands a joint company under the name GPWC Holding B\". Cantarella will be its first chairman. Fiat said the various companies had met the teams and invited them to participate in the series, which would start not later than 2008. Most teams are owned by or work closely with manufacturers and are bound by the terms of the Concorde Agreement, which runs out in 2007. The Kirch Group, heavily involved in pay television, controls 75% of Ecclestone's F1 holding company SLEC, which has secured the commercial rights for 100 years contingent upon there being an extension of the Concorde Agreement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
