There were flashes of recognition as he surveyed the sea of faces in front of him, several of whom had followed his ultimately unhappy stint at St James\u2019 Park back in 2007-08. \u201cWe all look older, don\u2019t we?\u201d he said, smiling before threatening to order the owner of a ringing phone to make a \u00a310 charity donation. Appreciably tightened discipline, on and off the field, is clearly required among Sunderland\u2019s squad but Allardyce has promised to handle a set of players once again embroiled in their annual relegation skirmish with perhaps unanticipated care and subtlety. Having made it clear first-teamers need to assume greater responsibility, a man who will shortly celebrate his 61st birthday suggested Sunderland\u2019s problems run a little deeper. The task ahead is more complicated than merely asking individuals to stand up and be counted. It seems he might well, once again, utilise the psychological profiling system he relied upon at Bolton. \u201cMental fragility is there, no doubt about it,\u201d said Allardyce. \u201cThe mental side is the one end of football that\u2019s really important. The psychological profile of the player and where he lies at the minute is important. And the mental fragility has to be relieved, has to be taken away by me using my experience, or the staff using their experience, to put those fears aside. To remind the player how good he is, why he\u2019s here, about his talent and why he\u2019s lost his way. I like to be proactive on that; not reactive. I\u2019m managing people and my people skills are my life skills.\u201d Listening to his thoughtful, measured, somewhat holistic comments it was hard to equate Allardyce with the rather more abrasive character who has used a new autobiography to brand Ars\u00e8ne Wenger as \u201carrogant\u201d and \u201ca bad loser\u201d. As Rafael Ben\u00edtez already knows and the Sunderland owner, Ellis Short, will doubtless soon learn, though, Allardyce specialises in straight talk and rarely pulls punches. Such clarity is probably precisely what the American financier requires right now and the manager, who is likely to be offered a decent January transfer-window budget, has already identified sometimes wildly sub-standard recruitment as the reason why Sunderland have spent much of the last decade floundering. \u201cWithout being too critical of anyone, the problem has to be recruitment,\u201d Allardyce said. \u201cYou live or die by who you recruit to play for you. At West Ham it all boiled down to me recruiting better and better each year. The owners backed me to sign the players and we made fewer and fewer mistakes over time. The last year at West Ham was the best of my life in terms of my recruitment. It\u2019s the hardest job in football.\u201d Bringing the best out of those on Sunderland\u2019s books will entail considerable dedication from his all-important support team. \u201cYou have to have a good backroom staff,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they have to be highly educated professionals.\u201d Some of his predecessors have claimed it was difficult to persuade transfer targets to relocate to the north-east but Allardyce sees little unattractive about Sunderland\u2019s habitat. \u201cWell, it won\u2019t be a problem if you get them here, to this training facility and then get them round the stadium,\u201d he said. \u201cThis place is magnificent. I\u2019ve not worked at a training facility as good as this in my entire life \u2013 West Ham\u2019s wasn\u2019t very good at all. This place gives me the best opportunity to get the best out of players. If you get out of bed and don\u2019t like coming here ... man, you shouldn\u2019t be working in the game.\u201d Then came a well-weighted pause followed by a less than coded message to Short. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to pay \u2019em well, though,\u201d he reflected. \u201cIf you don\u2019t hit the mark financially, you don\u2019t get the player.\u201d Allardyce is confident he can convince an owner singed by spending heavily on a series of shocking buys that his money will be well invested this time. \u201cWorking with players, no matter how challenging, is what I\u2019m best at,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a drug, an adrenaline drug, it\u2019s an addiction \u2013 that\u2019s what my wife keeps telling me \u2013 I can\u2019t leave it alone. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s what I was put on the planet to do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
