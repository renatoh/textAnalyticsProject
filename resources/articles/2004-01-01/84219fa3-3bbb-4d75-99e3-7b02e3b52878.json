Once Manchester United's supporters sang his name with pride, but though his performance on Saturday offered reminders of his greatest years at Old Trafford, on this occasion he was met only with howls of derision. Slowly he turned and cupped the other ear at them, which, like everything else the 36-year-old attempted against his former paymasters, was met with further jeers. Not far away Denis Irwin, another United alumnus, was enjoying the same fans' warm applause. \"It really does my head in the way they treat me,\" Ince said later. \"They'd won nothing for 26 years and I played an integral part in them winning their first championship, and helped start the dynasty that's been going ever since. \"It annoys me more than it upsets me. I won't go home and cry about it. I sweated for them for six years, so they should show some appreciation. To be treated like that, all because I went to Liverpool . . . but it's water off a duck's back and I had the last laugh today, especially given some of the crap I get off them.\" If United looked unlikely to win anything before Ince joined them in 1989, they were equally forlorn when he had finished with them on Saturday. This United performance was disappointing rather than disastrous but it did highlight the inadequacies in the champions' squad. Ruud van Nistelrooy missed from little more than a yard after Cristiano Ronaldo's first-half corner bounced through to the far post, but his chances were surprisingly few. His first shot on target came in the 90th minute, tellingly from outside the area, with a 20-yard strike on the turn that was comfortably saved. Neither Charlton, who won 4-0 here in August, nor Chelsea, whose 5-0 victory the following month remains Wolves' last defeat at Molineux, can have enjoyed more possession than did United, but each scored more goals than the decent chances created by the champions. Sir Alex Ferguson maintained after the game that their dominance should have been rewarded. \"They were never in the game and that is a fact,\" he said. \"The amount of really good positions we got into, we didn't really finish them off. I don't think it was a poor performance, not at all, but I'm disappointed that we didn't take our chances.\" But their inability to take chances was less disappointing than a frequent failure to create them. With Ryan Giggs injured, United rarely threatened down the wings and only once did they attack with any purpose through the centre. Though they had plenty of telling possession on the flanks, particularly on the right, dangerous deliveries were surprisingly few and the Wolves defence proved adept at dealing with them. When United displayed a little more cunning, however, it met with some success. In the 57th minute a move involving Roy Keane and John O'Shea led to Van Nistelrooy setting up Paul Scholes for a shot that Michael Oakes saved smartly. Then with 15 minutes remaining a Scholes pass let David Bellion slip through to test the goalkeeper again. \"I think they really missed Giggs today, to be honest,\" said Ince, whose 25-yard shot against the post was the home side's only noteworthy effort until Kenny Miller scampered through 20 minutes later to set up the greatest shock of the season so far. \"They just haven't got that width without him in their side. They had a lot of possession but they didn't really hurt us.\" Only once in the league this season, twice in all competitions, have United scored and not won. But when they fail to score they too frequently lose and Saturday's failure, on top of the previous weekend's scoreless draw with Newcastle, perhaps explains the hurry to sign Fulham's Louis Saha. Although creativity in midfield is clearly a quality they most lack, Saha's searing pace should make up for it to an extent. With a truly fast forward United might hope to score the kind of relatively straightforward goals, relying predominantly on speed of counterattack, that Arsenal's Thierry Henry and Liverpool's Michael Owen deliver so regularly. It remains to be seen whether Paul Butler can control Owen as well when Liverpool visit Molineux on Wednesday, or if Ince and Alex Rae, with a combined age of 70, can sustain their scurrying tenacity - though the memory of this result will help. \"It has given everybody a lift,\" said Oakes. \"It is a good feeling to keep a clean sheet against world-class strikers.\" Wolves' relegation worries persist, but at least they showed that, though the gap between Nationwide and Premiership might not be bridged over a season, it can be overcome for a day. No longer bottom of the league, they can now dream of survival. But they will always savour this victory.
