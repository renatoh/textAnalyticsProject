Suddenly direction was our construct, and the arms with my trust were foreign, not my father's, younger and anxiously comfortable. Suddenly the eyes of my own reflection in the window held secrets and threw smiles. Suddenly you smiled. I was still the passenger in a belt strap watching you drive the way kids do."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
