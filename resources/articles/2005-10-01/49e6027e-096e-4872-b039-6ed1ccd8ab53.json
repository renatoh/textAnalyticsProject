The company is presently refocusing around digital photography as its traditional film business rapidly disappears. Digital revenue during the third quarter rose 47% to $1.9bn - the first time that the digital division generated more revenue than Kodak's traditional business. Sales of film fell more sharply than Kodak and Wall Street had anticipated, dropping 20% to $1.7bn. The company's shares tumbled 9% as a result."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
