Michael Bay is combing the Guinness Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Pop as we speak. And given that the film\u2019s PRs need the surviving band members to do press junkets and turn up on the red carpet, it\u2019s often the manager who\u2019s the softest target in terms of assigning a cinematic antagonist. And why not? The music-biz manager is a modern Mephistopheles: he turns up in a flash of sulphur, drops a million quid in your lap, says \u201csign this\u201d, then extracts his diabolic price during 3am cocaine nosebleeds over the next 20 years. Some might say that managers are simply practical business types who are around at the time when vastly overpaid young people are making their own mistakes. And then inevitably get it in the neck from their mathematically illiterate clients who have blown all their cash on sedan chairs. The latter archetype doesn\u2019t make for a great film plot, however. Instead, the music manager in cinema has a few key attributes, and none of them is \u201cbasically a decent bloke\u201d. As these recent examples of real-life managers seen on screen prove \u2026 John Reid One thing is for sure: they\u2019re going to need more actors who can do a good John Reid. He turns up in Bohemian Rhapsody as Queen\u2019s manager. And he turns up in Rocketman as Elton John\u2019s manager, lover and tormentor, where, short, tubby and balding, Reid has the good fortune to be played by Richard Madden, tipped to be the next James Bond. Did he get a Hollywood makeover? If anything, he has been underplayed. Reid allegedly got into a fight with a journalist in a nightclub over \u201cthe lack of whisky at a press launch\u201d and was sentenced to a month in jail. In 1984, the day after Elton married Renate Blauel, he apparently beat up another hack; and he once slapped a female hack who reportedly called him a \u201cpoof\u201d. Bottom line: he doesn\u2019t like journalists. Biopic About Another Client Yet to Be Made Riverdance! Reid managed Michael Flatley, but things went so badly that he paid Reid a million quid as part of a wrongful termination suit. Doc McGhee Netflix scored an easy win this year with The Dirt, a film about walking telenovela M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. Their hale and hearty manager, Doc McGhee, also worked with Kiss, Bon Jovi and, briefly, Guns N\u2019 Roses. Did he get a Hollywood makeover? What\u2019s the opposite of that? McGhee is introduced into the narrative by slugging a guy at a party. But that didn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s a good lead-in to something else that didn\u2019t happen. McGhee wasn\u2019t sacked because he brought Nikki Sixx\u2019s mother to the hospital where he was recovering from an overdose. In unpleasant reality, the band threw a tantrum because they\u2019d been given a shorter set than Bon Jovi at the Moscow Peace festival.

Albert Grossman \u201cRock\u2019n\u2019roll\u2019s Citizen Kane\u201d was a man who blazed bright, then guttered just as quickly. Manager to artists such as Bob Dylan, the Band, Joan Baez and Richie Havens, he opened one of the first folk clubs in America, where, if the audience weren\u2019t paying full attention, they\u2019d be asked to leave. Did they get a Hollywood makeover? Not really. Grossman turns up in both the factual documentary Don\u2019t Look Back and Todd Haynes\u2019s Dylan biopic I\u2019m Not There, saying precisely the same thing to a British hotelier: \u201cAnd you, sir, are one of the dumbest assholes and most stupid persons I\u2019ve ever spoken to in my life.\u201d He also turns up in gruff caricature in the Coen Brothers\u2019 Inside Llewyn Davis, played by F Murray Abraham. Tetchy and arrogant, Grossman took 25%, when the industry norm was 15. Which, among many other reasons, was why Dylan and the rest of his roster eventually left.
