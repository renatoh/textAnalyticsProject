The additions include John Mayock in the 1500 metres and the high jump pair Dalton Grant, who won the trials in Birmingham earlier this month, and Ben Challenger. Anthony Whiteman, already selected for the 800m, has also been added to the 1500m having won the trials but in a time that was outside the qualifying mark. James McIlroy, fourth in the last European Championships in Budapest in 1998 while competing for the Republic of Ireland, has been given a berth in the 800m. Joice Maduaka and Abi Oyepitan have been named in the women's individual 100m having initially been included only in the relay squad. \"The additional athletes we have selected are those that have achieved the UK Athletics qualifying standard since the first selection date last week and others who are close to the UK Athletics standard and within the European Athletic Association standard,\" said Max Jones, UK Athletics' performance director."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
