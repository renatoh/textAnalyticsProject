With Livingston yesterday joining Dundee and Motherwell in administration, and McLeish's own club staggering under unprecedented debts of \u00a368m, the Scottish game is in a sorry state. McLeish, who traced the problem back to the Scottish Premierleague's decision to reject a Sky TV deal in favour of an attempt to set up its own channel, called for the government to step in or for the banks to be more lenient. He said: \"It is a sad indictment of the Scottish game to see clubs in administration. We have all got our problems and I have said many times that they are not unique to Rangers. \"Throughout the European game, people spent television money in advance and then the bottom dropped out of that market. But McLeish admitted: \"I'm not so sure that if we had accepted the \u00a342m from Sky we wouldn't have spent that as well. If only we knew then what we know now. \"But hopefully there will be solutions and teams can survive because Scottish towns and cities need their football teams. It is the No1 sport. \"But I think there is still a bit of pain to come. You would really need to ask the money men, the financial wizards in the City but it would be nice to see some sort of solution, whether it is the government or the banks who save the Scottish game and save football in general.\" Rangers' German midfielder Christian Nerlinger also pointed out that football across Europe was feeling the pinch but insisted debt-ridden clubs had only them selves to blame. He said: \"At Dortmund, my ex-club, they have had problems, and in Italy and Spain it is a similar situation. \"I am a sportsman, not a businessman, but I think you can only invest the money you have. Then things like that should not happen.\" Rangers are looking for a \u00a3500,000 windfall from appearing in the CIS Insurance Cup final on March 14, but first they must beat Hibernian at Hampden Park tonight to earn the right to meet Livingston. Rangers will be without the winger Peter Lovenkrands for a month because of the ankle damage sustained on Sunday against Partick and he joins Gavin Rae, Steven Thompson and Stephen Hughes on the absentee list. But the arrival of the Dutch international Frank de Boer, his brother Ronald's recovery from a knee operation and the captain Craig Moore's return from suspension mean that McLeish has options in all departments, especially as Mikel Arteta and Shota Arveladze, who missed the Partick Thistle game, are also back in the fold. Hibernian's teenage midfielder Kevin Thomson is hoping his first trip to Hampden as a player will eventually lead to the club ending their 13-year wait for a major trophy. The 19-year-old was a Hibs fan at the 1991 Skol Cup final when the Edinburgh club beat Dunfermline and he is desperate to end the long wait. Meanwhile, Nerlinger has appealed to the Scottish FA not to punish the referee Stuart Dougal for swearing at him during Rangers' match on Sunday. Dougal was caught on camera apparently using strong language to Nerlinger, but the German said: \"We had a conversation but I never heard him say those words towards me. What happens during the game, conversation-wise, is not that important. After the game you have to shake hands and forget about it, so it is not a big deal at all. \"He is a good referee and I am looking forward to getting him again. If the SFA want to, they can call me.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
