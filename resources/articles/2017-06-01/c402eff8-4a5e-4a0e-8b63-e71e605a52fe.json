The US president vehemently denied allegations that he asked Comey to pledge loyalty and drop an investigation into a senior aide. But Trump refused to confirm or deny that recordings of the pair\u2019s conversations exist. The remarks came a day after Comey testified under oath that the president lied about his firing and the FBI, in an effort to undermine the agency\u2019s investigation into possible collusion between Trump aides and Russia. \u201cNo collusion, no obstruction, he\u2019s a leaker,\u201d Trump told reporters in the White House rose garden on Friday. \u201cWe were very, very happy, and, frankly, James Comey confirmed a lot of what I said, and some of the things that he said just weren\u2019t true.\u201d But later in the joint press conference with the Romanian president Klaus Iohannis, Trump was challenged by ABC News correspondent Jonathan Karl. First Karl asked about Comey\u2019s claim that Trump asked him to let go an investigation into national security adviser Michael Flynn. \u201cI will tell you, I didn\u2019t say that,\u201d the president replied. \u201cAnd there\u2019d be nothing wrong if I did say that, according to everybody that I\u2019ve read today, but I did not say that.\u201d Trump also denied seeking a pledge of loyalty, as Comey claimed had happened when the men dined at the White House in January. Karl then asked if Trump would be willing to speak under oath to give his version of those events. \u201cOne hundred per cent,\u201d said the president. \u201cI hardly know the man. I\u2019m not going to say, \u2018I want you to pledge allegiance.\u2019 Who would do that? Who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath? Think of it: I hardly know the man, it doesn\u2019t make sense. No, I didn\u2019t say that, and I didn\u2019t say the other.\u201d Trump said he would be \u201cglad\u201d to tell the same thing to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the presidential election. But Trump remained elusive on the subject of tapes. He had tweeted on 12 May: \u201cJames Comey better hope that there are no \u2018tapes\u2019 of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!\u201d Comey said on Thursday he hoped there were tapes and he would be happy for them to be released. Asked on Friday if such tapes exist, Trump built suspense by saying: \u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you about that maybe some time in the very near future.\u201d As reporters shouted in protest, he promised them in \u201ca short period of time\u201d, merely feeding the frenzy. One reporter shouted: \u201cAre there tapes, sir?\u201d He replied: \u201cOh, you\u2019re going to be very disappointed when you hear the answer, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Soon after he spoke, the House intelligence committee announced that it had written to White House counsel Don McGahn to request that, if any recordings or memoranda of Comey\u2019s conversations with Trump exist, they be produced to the committee by 23 June. The press conference was not Trump\u2019s first public comment on Thursday\u2019s Senate intelligence committee hearing. That came on Twitter early on Friday morning. \u201cDespite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication \u2026 and WOW, Comey is a leaker!\u201d he posted. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s legal team was confirmed to be preparing to file a complaint against Comey for sharing his memos of meetings with the president with the New York Times. After Comey\u2019s testimony, Trump\u2019s lawyer Marc Kasowitz said in a brief statement to the press the former FBI director had \u201cadmitted that he unilaterally and surreptitiously made unauthorised disclosures to the press of privileged communications with the president\u201d. The legal complaint will be filed with the office of the inspector general for the Department of Justice early next week, according to a source close to the legal team who did not want to speak on the record before the complaint was filed. The legal team will also send a complaint to the Senate judiciary committee regarding Comey\u2019s testimony before that panel last month \u2013 as well as his testimony before the intelligence committee \u2013 to clarify on the record what Trump\u2019s legal team views as discrepancies and falsehoods in the displaced FBI director\u2019s testimony. Richard Painter, a White House ethics counsel under George W Bush, said such an action would only amplify the notion that Trump was trying to impede the investigation. \u201cTrying to get DOJ to go after Comey \u2013 a material witness \u2013 over \u2018leak\u2019 is yet more obstruction of Justice,\u201d he tweeted. Trump has long history of threatening legal action but failing to follow through. On Thursday, Kasowitz said the the president\u2019s team would \u201cleave it to the appropriate authorities\u201d to determine whether Comey\u2019s actions warranted further investigation. It\u2019s unclear what action the justice department might be able to take against Comey, who was no longer employed by it at the time. It\u2019s also uncertain whether a formal complaint to the Senate judiciary committee would prompt a meaningful response. Moreover, several experts agree that Comey did not violate any laws by sharing his personal memos with a friend to be made public and that his actions did not constitute the \u201cunauthorized disclosure of privileged information\u201d. \u201cIt is not a \u2018violation\u2019 of executive privilege to voluntarily disclose materials that could be protected by the privilege, no matter what Kasowitz says,\u201d Steve Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, wrote in the Washington Post. \u201cNor is such a voluntary disclosure illegal.\u201d At least one Democratic senator, Brian Schatz of Hawaii, suggested Trump should now testify before Congress himself. \u201cThis is not just another silly tweet,\u201d Schatz tweeted. \u201cIt is essential for our country that the president offer his testimony to Congress about what exactly happened.\u201d In an interview on Friday, Rhode Island senator Jack Reed, an ex officio member of the Senate intelligence committee, said he expected Robert Mueller, the special counsel appointed in the wake of Comey\u2019s firing to take over the Russia inquiry, to depose the president as part of the investigation. Comey, who was fired by Trump on 9 May, told the Senate intelligence committee he believed the president fired him \u201cbecause of the Russia investigation. I was fired in some way to change, or the endeavor was to change, the way the Russia investigation was being conducted. That is a very big deal.\u201d Comey confirmed that he detailed in memos several conversations in which the president asked him to drop his inquiry into former national security adviser Michael Flynn \u2013 saying \u201cI hope you can let this go\u201d \u2013 and sought a pledge of loyalty that Comey deemed inappropriate, given FBI independence. Comey also branded Trump a liar and said the president had mischaracterized their conversations to justify his abrupt dismissal. \u201cThe administration chose to defame me and, more importantly, the FBI, by saying that the organisation was in disarray, that it was poorly led, that the workforce had lost confidence in its leader,\u201d Comey said. \u201cThose were lies, plain and simple, and I\u2019m so sorry that the FBI workforce had to hear them, and I\u2019m so sorry the American people were told them.\u201d Comey said he told Trump on three occasions he was not personally under investigation. Federal investigators have cautioned that their inquiry into contacts between Trump and Moscow remains inconclusive, but Trump\u2019s lawyers and supporters nonetheless seized on that piece of information to claim the president had been cleared of wrongdoing. Comey also suggested that Mueller was investigating whether Trump\u2019s actions amounted to obstruction of justice. Comey said he asked a friend, a member of the law department of Columbia University, to give to the New York Times details of his memos about his interactions with Trump, \u201cbecause I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel\u201d. Mueller was appointed as special counsel on 17 May. Comey explained that he documented each meeting with Trump because he thought the president might be dishonest about what transpired. \u201cI was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting, and so I thought it really important to document,\u201d he said of their first conversation at Trump Tower in New York in January. Trump issued a second tweet just before 7am, writing about what is reportedly his favored morning show: \u201cGreat reporting by @foxandfriends and so many others. Thank you!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
