It\u2019s less that the Saints lost this game, it\u2019s that the Rams won it. These teams were competing for the title of the best team in the NFL for much of the game. It makes sense that four quarters weren\u2019t going to be enough and that it would come down to a field goal (hey did someone predict that the key player would end up being the kicker?) In any case, I\u2019m going to become a mere spectator to the AFC Championship Game (join David Lengel for his liveblog here and The game report for this game is down below.). Meanwhile, thanks to everybody who read along to our liveblog, especially those who contributed. Ciao! Ben Dunn: The Saints just cannot catch a break in the post-season. On the wrong end of the Miracle last year, and this year the wrong side of the New Orleans No-Call. Unreal. There will be plenty of talk about the no-call at the end of regulation, and that\u2019s understandable and man would I be mad as a New Orleans fans, but the Saints had mishandled that drive from the very beginning. They had chances to win and couldn\u2019t convert. The Rams have won the NFC Championship Game! What incredible poise by Goff and the Rams who could have been dead several times there. Rams 26-23 Saints, FINAL The Rams can win it here with a field goal, since the Saints have already had possession in this overtime. AND IT\u2019S GOOD! THE RAMS ARE HEADED TO THE SUPER BOWL! Rams 23-23 Saints, 11:47, OT The Rams pick up a first down on their first possession of overtime, but lose three yards on the next play. Goff finds Higbee for a 6 yard gain. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 7 at the New Orleans 39. On the next play, Goff throws to Cooks who drops it. Saints take a timeout, with Zeurlein coming out for a 57 yard attempt. Rams 23-23 Saints, 13:55, OT Brees throws a dangerous long pass and it\u2019s intercepted by Johnson at the Saints 46! Falling on the back as he does so. Rams 23-23 Saints, 14:48, OT On 1st &amp; 10, Brees\u2019s pass is tipped and goes incomplete. 2nd &amp; 10, Brees throws deep and this time there\u2019s a flag, leading to some sarcastic clapping. It\u2019s defensive pass interference, which gives them 14 yards and an automatic first down. They\u2019re at their own 40 now. On 1st &amp; 10, Ingram gets stuffed, a huge loss. Six yards. Rams 23-23 Saints, 15:00, OT Kamara brings out the ball to start overtime. He gets to the NO 26. Ben Dunn: If the Rams win this, that non-call on the obvious foul on the Saints WR is going to be a huge talking point. If that was called, as it should have been, that was game over. Not wrong. The Saints will have the ball to start overtime, so they have a shot still. Rams 23-23 Saints, end of regulation The Rams kick it off, probably just hoping for no return here. Kamara takes it out of the end zone and gives it a decent return but remains well within Saints territory. Drew Brees takes a knee and we\u2019re going to overtime and the crowd is steamed. Rams 23-23 Saints, :15, 4th quarter The Rams get it into field goal range. It\u2019s a 48-yard attempt for Zuerlein. The crowd gets loud. The kick is JUST good. Rams 20-23 Saints, :45, 4th quarter 3rd &amp; 3, Goff finds Woods who gets it to the New Orleans 33. The Rams take another timeout. Rams 20-23 Saints, 1:12, 4th quarter 2nd &amp; 10, Goff hits Reynolds for a first down that takes them to their own 44. On 1st &amp; 10, Goff throws incomplete. 2nd &amp; 10, Cooks gets seven yards. Rams 20-23 Saints, 1:37, 4th quarter On 1st &amp; 10, Goff throws incomplete. That\u2019s a start for the Saints defense. Rams 20-23 Saints, 1:41, 4th quarter Now the Rams have a lot of time to even this thing out or win it outright. Lutz\u2019s kickoff goes for a touchback. Rams 20-23 Saints, 1:45, 4th quarter It\u2019s 3rd and 10 now for the Saints, who are in danger of botching this drive. Brees throws incomplete\u2026 and it feels like there should be a flag on the play somewhere. Instead, the Saints have to settle for a field goal. Lutz\u2019s kick is good. The crowd is booing, which is understandable. Rams 20-20 Saints, 1:49, 4th quarter Kamara gets stuffed for no gain and the Rams take a timeout. Rams 20-20 Saints, 2:00, 4th quarter The Saints are now on the Rams 13. On 1st &amp; 10, Brees throws incomplete to Thomas. They take a time-out, that feels like a miscalculation on the Saints considering the clock. And on the next play, Brees has to use a timeout. Rams 20-20 Saints, 2:00, 4th quarter There\u2019s Aaron Donald for the Rams, pushing back Ingram for a two-yard loss. 2nd &amp; 12 for the Saints, Brees throws deep, 43 yards to Ginn! And we\u2019re at the two minute warning with the Saints in good position to win this whole thing. Rams 20-20 Saints, 3:37, 4th quarter Brees finds Austin Carr for a five yard down on first down. It\u2019s 2nd &amp; 5 at their 35. Saints are in shotgun, they hand it off to Ingram who is immediately tackled. On 3rd &amp; 2, he throws to Kamara who stays inbounds and reaches the New Orleans 46. That\u2019s a first down. Rams 20-20 Saints, 5:03, 4th quarter I would have went for the touchdown on 4th down. Of course, I would always go for it on fourth down I would be a terrible head coach. Saints are back on the field, Kamara takes the kickoff for a 30 yard gain. Ben Dunn: The game is great. The coaches are having a stormer. Rams and Saints are making adjustments and they are working. They\u2019ve studied the life out of each other and their season strengths are being largely negated. Fascinating to watch. Two high-quality chess-playing head coaches not making many errors so far. And it\u2019s heading for a great finish\u2026 perhaps overtime. Rams 20-20 Saints, 5:16, 4th quarter 2nd &amp; goal, Goff takes it on his own and gets it to the second-yard line. The Saints are lucky there\u2019s not a touchdown. 3rd &amp; goal, Anderson gets the ball\u2026 and he\u2019s just short of the goal line. It\u2019s 4th &amp; goal and it looks like they\u2019re going to go conservative and bring out the field goal unit. It\u2019s a chip-shot, a 19 yarder, except there\u2019s a delay of game which pushes it back to the 24 yard line. No worries, it\u2019s good nonetheless and we have a tied game. Rams 17-20 Saints, 7:23, 4th quarter And another huge throw by Goff, who throws to Reynolds all the way at the Saints 7. That\u2019s a 30+ yard gain. 1st &amp; goal, Anderson gets to the 5 yard line. Rams 17-20 Saints, 8:50, 4th quarter Oh wow. This might be the biggest play of the game, Goff hits Everett who gets the ball and runs it down for a 39 yard gain all the way from deep into their own territory to the Saints\u2019 39 yard line. Anderson picks up 5 yards on first down, their at the New Orleans 40. Rams 17-20 Saints, 9:38, 4th quarter Well, Gurley\u2019s back out there it seems and he gets the ball to start things off, getting about six yards on first down. Woods gets the ball next and gets just one yard. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 3 on the Rams own 16. On the next play, the Rams take a timeout right before Goff throws incomplete, which the fans aren\u2019t super-happy about. And we do have a Gene Loves Jezebel appearance! They did a fantastic job last possession, the offense just couldn\u2019t convert. What a huge penalty that ended up being on New Orleans. Rams 17-20 Saints, 11:04, 4th quarter On 2nd &amp; 20, Kamara gets stopped by Suh after a 3 yard gain. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 17, and it\u2019s looking like this promising drive could fizzle quickly. And it does, Brees\u2019s throw to Ginn is incomplete, nearly picked off, and that will do it. Morstead\u2019s punt puts the Rams on their own 9. Rams 17-20 Saints, 11:51, 4th quarter Saints are at the LA 46. Ingram picks up 4 yards, but wait there\u2019s a penalty that will push them back 10 yards. It\u2019s 1st &amp; 20 at the New Orleans 44 now. Brees throws incomplete to Dan Arnold. So make that 2nd &amp; 20. Rams 17-20 Saints, 12:29, 4th quarter The Rams are punting from their own seven\u2026 except there\u2019s a penalty on the Saints that pushes them up five yards. And there\u2019s a flag on the punt, this time on the Rams, a 15-yard chop block penalty that, after the catch, means that the Saints are starting in LA territory. Rams 17-20 Saints, 12:59, 4th quarter Let\u2019s see if that \u201cno call\u201d ends up hurting the Saints here. The Rams take the field with a chance to tie or better. The announcers are speculating on Gurley\u2019s health here, it\u2019s a surprise we haven\u2019t seen him. And thanks to a huge sack by Cam Jordan, they limit the Rams to a 3-0. Rams 17-20 Saints, 14:56, 4th quarter Brees throws incomplete to start the fourth quarter, Saints fans want a call here and there might be holding here. The Saints have to punt instead. Natson catches the punt on the Rams 34. Rams 17-20 Saints, end of the 3rd quarter The ball comes out on the next play, but Kamara gets right on so all they lose is a down. 2nd &amp; 10, Ingram picks up three. That will due it for the third. I\u2019m thinking this might be a suspenseful fourth quarter, so stick with us. Rams 17-20 Saints, 1:57, 3rd quarter Zuerlein\u2019s kickoff is another touchback. Not a lot of drama when it comes to that department. The Saints immediately get the first down thanks to Brees throw to Tre\u2019Quan Smith. Brees, working in the shotgun, then finds Thomas to their own 44 and Ingram gets the first down and more, all the way to midfield. Rams 17-20 Saints, 3:06, 3rd quarter It looks like an elbow injury for Bell (and by looks, I mean the replay made painfully clear). Josh Reynolds gets stopped right before the goal line. It\u2019s 1st &amp; goal at the one. And almost disaster for the Rams, as Goff fumbles at the snap to lose a few yards. They\u2019re at the 3 now. Anderson picks up a yard on next down and on 3rd &amp; goal, Goff finds Tyler Higbee open in the end zone for a touchdown. With another successful extra point it once again becomes a three-point game. Rams 10-20 Saints, 5:15, 3rd quarter And Goff goes long\u2026 a long throw to Cooks that gets them to the halfway mark. On the next play, Anderson gets about a yard. 2nd &amp; 9\u2026 a yellow flag flies down, it\u2019s offside on the Saints. That\u2019s five yards and no play. 2nd &amp; 4. Goff finds Cooks for a 25 yard gain and they\u2019re already at the Saints 17. The Saints\u2019 Von Bell looks to be hurt so we get an injury timeout. Rams 10-20 Saints, 7:25, 3rd quarter Anderson picks up four yards. Huge 3rd &amp; 2 here, and the Rams convert. Goff throws short to Cooks for a another four. That\u2019s a new first down. Rams 10-20 Saints, 8:04, 3rd quarter Lutz\u2019s kickoff is yet another touchback, they\u2019ll be on their own 25. Goff finds Woods for a four-yard gain to start their possession. Rams 10-20 Saints, 8:37, 3rd quarter They\u2019re rolling now. On 2nd &amp; 1, the Saints pick up a first down and it\u2019s 1st and goal. On his first attempt, Brees throws incomplete, underthrown to Thomas. 2nd &amp; goal, Taysom Hill gets the ball for some reason, his throw to Kamara is complete. 3rd &amp; goal, Hill decides to go back to being a receiver, which works out rather well. Brees connects with him for a touchdown. Lutz\u2019s extra point is good. Rams 10-13 Saints, 11:08, 3rd quarter Saints are going super-fast now. Brees finds Kamara again, why go away with what\u2019s working, he gets 8 yards here. They\u2019re in the red zone now. Rams 10-13 Saints, 11:55, 3rd quarter And Kamara gets the ball again and picks up 9 this time around. 2nd &amp; 1\u2026 yep that\u2019s Kamara again, this time for a seven-yard run. That\u2019s another first down and on the next, Ingram runs it again and they\u2019re already on the LA 26. Rams 10-13 Saints, 13:03, 3rd quarter On 1st &amp; 10, Ingram gets about six yards. 2nd &amp; 4, Brees targets Kamara, their MVP of the game so far, who easily gets a first down. Rams 10-13 Saints, 14:16, 3rd quarter Woods gets the ball to start the first half, who gets taken for a four-yard loss. On 2nd &amp; 13, Goff throws incomplete to Woods who can\u2019t make the catch. 3rd &amp; 14, Goff throws incomplete yet again. Let\u2019s see if they fake punt again And nope. Just a real punt, one that puts the Saints at the own 29 after a bit of rolling. And we begin the second half with a touchback. The Rams will start at their own 25. The Ying Yang Twins apparently are doing the halftime performance, which makes more sense for New Orleans than Jimmy Buffett who should legally be forced to root for the Dolphins. Donald Buchnowski: I am here in the Dominican Republic keeping up and my family in Buffalo are all for the Saints!!! Well, they\u2019re ahead for now but that was a brutal way to end the half. Still, we knew 13 points wasn\u2019t going to be a comfortable cushion in this game. From Pranjal Tiwari: I\u2019m still confused by \u201clove will tear us apart\u201d making an appearance today. Do you know if that\u2019s a Saints anthem or something, or was it the broadcaster that used it? Very strange. And now \u201cShe Sells Sanctuary\u201d by The Cult! Goth / New wave production manager perhaps? I\u2019m hoping for Gene Loves Jezebel next. I guarantee that there is no NFL team that has a Joy Division song as an anthem but if there did it would probably be the Browns. Roger Kirkby: To The comment about headphones, up in the rafters sit a bunch of guys relaying what is going on, on the field to the coordinators on the ground. Either that or they podcast the game. I knew someone in the audience would know the full answer. I guess the way to tell is if they start advertising SeatGeeks.com midway through their conversations. Well this was looking like a one-sided affair until the last minute of the half. That huge completion by Goff changed everything and the Rams will have the ball to start the half. This is definitely looking different from most of the snoozers last weekend. Rams 10-13 Saints, end of the first half That will quiet down the crowd. What an absolute game-changer for the Rams. Kamara returns the Rams punt to the 20. Drew Brees decides to kneel here and take things to the half. Rams 10-13 Saints, :23, 2nd quarter There\u2019s a flag on the punt, on the receiving team it turns out. It\u2019s a 10-yard penalty on the Rams, which will mean that they will be starting at their 19. Goff throws to Reynolds who gets 9 yards. 2nd &amp; 1. They connect again for a 13 yard gain that brings them to their own 41. The clock is now a factor here as well. 1st &amp; 10, Goff throws in complete. On 2nd &amp; 10, Goff\u2019s pass is tipped, and is also incomplete. So it\u2019s 3rd &amp; 10, less than a minute to go in the half\u2026 and Goff finds Cooks for a 17 yard gain into New Orleans territory. Rams used their second timeout. Holy heck, Goff throws to Cooks for 36 yards! They\u2019re at the Saints 6\u2026 for a split second! Gurley runs in for a touchdown. The extra point is good! It\u2019s a three-point game! It\u2019s certainly a factor. Rams 3-13 Saints, 2:00, 2nd quarter That\u2019s a better showing for LA, Ndamukong Suh sacks Brees for a six yard loss, and then gets a half-sack on the next play, by pushing Brees back on first yard. The Rams get another stop on the next play, a play that brings us to the two-minute warning. Rams 3-13 Saints, 3:50, 2nd quarter Kamara gets two yards on 1st down. Ginn picks up 6 yards on 2nd &amp; 8. A big 3rd &amp; 2 here for the Rams defense. And they do not pass the test, Brees finds Kamara for a first down. Rams 3-13 Saints, 5:27, 2nd quarter 2nd &amp; 10, Anderson picks up 6 yards, to the Rams 40. He\u2019s having another big night. On 3rd &amp; 4, Goff throws incomplete and that will stall things out. Hekker\u2019s punt will put the Saints at their own 17. Rams 3-13 Saints, 6:18, 2nd quarter Goff throws incomplete and the Saints take a timeout. Rams 3-13 Saints, 6:18, 2nd quarter Anderson picks up 3 yards for the Rams on first down. On 2nd &amp; 7, Woods makes a great catch of Goff\u2019s throw for a 6 yard gain. A big 3rd &amp; 1 for Los Angeles here. Anderson just gets it. Email from Ezra Finkelstein: Do all players have headsets in their helmets? Because otherwise why are all the coordinators talking into their headsets? I believe just the quarterback and an additional player on the defense. Rams 3-13 Saints, 8:15, 2nd quarter On 2nd &amp; 12, a pressured Brees throws on the run for a seven yard gain. Not sure how exactly he did it, but it\u2019s still a 3rd &amp; 5 and his throw to Kamara goes incomplete. The Saints punt and JoJo Natson makes a fair catch on the Rams 22. Rams 3-13 Saints, 9:45, 2nd quarter Zuerlein\u2019s kickoff ends up being a touchback. On first down, Kamara gets stuffed for a two yard loss back to the Saints 23. Rams 3-13 Saints, 9:49, 2nd quarter Goff finds Brandin Cooks for a four-yard gain on first down. On second down, they hand off to CJ Anderson who can\u2019t quite get anywhere. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 6 at the Saints 18, Gurley gets the ball and drops it but there\u2019s a flag on the play\u2026 but there\u2019s no penalty. It\u2019s 4th down for the Rams. Greg Zuerlein makes his debut for a 36 yard field goal that\u2019s down the middle and the Rams are on the board. Rams 0-13 Saints, 11:47, 2nd quarter The Rams are at the Saints 26 in their first real scoring chance of the game. Anderson gets the ball the next carry for a four yard gain and another first down. Rams 0-13 Saints, 12:09, 2nd quarter The Rams allow Goff to return as quarterback. On 1st &amp; 10 at the Saints 45, he throw incomplete. On 2nd &amp; 10, Goff finds Gerald Everett for 11 yards and another 1st down. CJ Anderson picks up 8 yards on the next down. The Saints\u2019 AJ Klein gets medical attention as we head into an injury break. Rams 0-13 Saints, 13:31, 2nd quarter Woods gets a gain of a single yard on 3rd down\u2026 and the Rams decide to let punter Johnny Hekker find Sam Shields for a 12 yards gain on a fake punt! Now that is some creative offense! Their first 1st down! Roger Kirkby: No imagination from either team so far, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s low scoring. Maybe they are just too scared of both offences. Remember the Rams were way down against the Saints earlier this season. Well, the Saints offense seems to have picked up. The Rams\u2026 not so much. Rams 0-13 Saints, end of the 1st quarter 2nd &amp; 10. The crowd has not gotten louder, CJ Anderson picks up 5 yards again\u2026 for the last play of the quarter. The Rams have a total of 15 yards and have had zero first downs. Rams 0-13 Saints, :32, 1st quarter CJ Anderson gets his first carry of the game, for 5 yards. On 2nd &amp; 5, the Rams pick up another penalty, this time a false start that negates their gain. The Rams take a timeout. The announcers speculate that the crowd noise is a factor here. Rams 0-13 Saints, 1:40, 1st quarter Another Lutz kick, another touchback. Now would be a good time for the Rams to get their first 1st down. And \u201cThe Masked Singer\u201d episodes, apparently. Rams 0-13 Saints, 1:40, 1st quarter On 1st &amp; 10, Brees throws to Ginn who can\u2019t quite make the completion. 2nd &amp; 10, Kamara gains about 6 yards. 3rd &amp; 4 at the Los Angeles 12\u2026 and Kamara can only pick up another two yards. On 4th and 2, the Saints, who are aggressive, put the offense back on the field\u2026 an they draw a defensive encroachment penalty for a first down. And on the next play, Brees finds Garrett Griffin for the first touchdown of the game and the extra point is good. That was Griffin\u2019s first catch of the year. Rams 0-6 Saints, 3:08, 1st quarter The Saints pick up two yards on first down. On 2nd &amp; 8, Thomas catches a Brees pass and gets tackled immediately. It\u2019ll be 3rd &amp; 2, and another chance for the Rams to shut down a promising drive by New Orleans. Instead, Brees finds an open Thomas who picks up a first down at the Rams 18. Rams 0-6 Saints, 5:05, 1st quarter It really feels like the Saints should already be up by two touchdowns considering their first two possessions. Wow, Josh Hill picks up 24 yards to get to the LA 44. He comes off a little dazed, however. That\u2019s not a good sign. Rams 0-6 Saints, 5:35, 1st quarter The Rams\u2019 punt puts the Saints at their own 34, decent starting position. Wait, I\u2019m pretty sure the broadcast just went out with \u201cLove Will Tear Us Apart.\u201d Kind of a downbeat choice there, guys. Rams 0-6 Saints, 5:35, 1st quarter And the Saints hold the Rams to a 3-0. Might be a decent defensive battle brewing here. Rams 0-6 Saints, 7:10, 1st quarter Lutz\u2019s kickoff goes to the end zone again for a second straight touchback. Email from Ezra Finkelstein Pretty dull game so far,with the run game of both teams not working.Wonder if Bill Belichick is watching... Good question, I would think he\u2019s still getting the Patriots prepared. Rams 0-6 Saints, 7:10, 1st quarter So, the Saints take over at the Rams 15. The Rams defense steps up though, limiting Brees and the Saints to a 3-0. Lutz kicks a 29 yard field goal right through the uprights. Again, could be worse for the Rams. Rams 0-3 Saints, 8:42, 1st quarter On 2nd &amp; 3, Gurley gets stuffed for a loss. It\u2019ll be 3rd &amp; 7, Goff\u2019s pass gets deflected and then intercepted by Demario Davis! Oof! Rams 0-3 Saints, 9:26, 1st quarter Well, that could have gone worse for the Rams. It looked like Brees had thrown a sure touchdown pass at the end of that Saints drive. There\u2019s a flag on the kickoff, an illegal block on the Rams, who will start on their own 10. On 1st &amp; 10, Jared Goff throws to Robert Woods, who picks up about seven yards. Rams 0-3 Saints, 10:07, 1st quarter On 3rd &amp; 7, Brees throws to Dan Arnold who can\u2019t quite hold on for the touchdown. Big drop. The Saints have to settle for a field goal here. Wil Lutz\u2019s 37 yard field goal is good and New Orleans is on the board first. Email by Roger Kirkby: Hi Hunter, watching the game in a pub in London, definitely not the same as watching it in a bar in California. I\u2019d like to see the Rams win. It would make coming back to LA the right decision. They have to fight for the honor of LA football after the Chargers laid an egg last Sunday. Rams 0-0 Saints, 10:12, 1st quarter And on the next throw, Drews and Kamara connect again and get to the 22 yard mark. 1st &amp; 10, Brees throws incomplete. On 2nd &amp; 10, Brees finds Thomas for a three yard gain before Aqib Talib stops him. The Saints take a very early timeout. Rams 0-0 Saints, 11:53, 1st quarter Mark Ingram picks up 9 yards on 1st down but then gets stuffed for a two yard loss. 3rd &amp; 3, Rams could make a big stop here. Instead Brees throws long to Kamara. A beautiful 21 yard pass to get the Saints to the Rams 36. Rams 0-0 Saints, 14:16, 1st quarter The Saints are starting at their own 25. Brees throws to Michael Thomas on 1st &amp; 10, but it\u2019s incomplete. On 2nd down, Alvin Kamara picks up about two yards. On 3rd and long, Brees finds Ted Ginn for a nine yard completion and a first down. Rams 0-0 Saints, 15:00, 1st quarter Rams win the toss and they will (rightfully) defer. That\u2019s my one NFL strategy: always defer on the opening coin toss. That means the Saints will receive to start the first half while the Rams will start off the second half. The Ram\u2019s kickoff goes to the end zone for a touchback. Jimmy Buffett is singing the national anthem (?). Okay I\u2019ve definitely taken something. I\u2019m giving it a 3/10 and I\u2019m being super-generous. And the lights go out and the fire display goes off (I hope that\u2019s what I\u2019m seeing) as the players start taking the field. We are getting closer to kickoff and more importantly, we\u2019re getting closer to the end of the pregame show. Something just happened involving Rob Riggle and puppets. Or I have accidentally ingested something psychoactive. This liveblog could get dicey shortly if the latter. I\u2019ve already made my prediction, I\u2019ve got the Saints just outlasting the Rams. I am pretty much putting all my faith in the venerable Drew Brees making the Super Bowl for the first time since his 2009 victory. Your thoughts?

The FOX NFL pregame show has like three more people on it than necessary, this is like a scene from a Marx Brothers movie. The set is about to topple over thanks to the combined weight. AFC Championship Game Later in the day, 6:40pm EST to be precise, the Guardian will be liveblogging the AFC Championship Game between the New England Patriots and the Kansas City Chiefs. It should be a great match between the top quarterback in the league in Tom Brady and his possible successor in Patrick Mahomes. The Patriots ran all over the Los Angeles Chargers while the Chiefs handled the Indianapolis Colts with ease. This one should be a much closer game, at least if their regular season matchup is anything to go by. For a good chunk of the season, the Los Angeles Rams and the New Orleans Saints were fighting for the best record in the NFL, and they both managed to secure it, ending the season at 13-3. The Saints, however, owned the tiebreaker, so they\u2019ll be hosting today\u2019s game. So, it\u2019s pretty fitting that the two of them will face each other in the NFC Championship Game with a Super Bowl appearance on the line. The Rams had a slightly easier time getting to the penultimate round of the playoffs. While the final score of their win over the Dallas Cowboys was 30-22, the Cowboys were coming from behind the entire way. Led by the running back duo of Todd Gurley and CJ Anderson, they managed to end the Cowboys without much fuss. Unfortunately for them, Drew Brees and the Saints will prove to be a somewhat more difficult task, particularly since they will have home field advantage today (not that the Coliseum makes for the most daunting place to play for opponents, but still). The Saints 20-14 comeback victory against the Philadelphia Eagles finally ended Nick Foles\u2019s magical postseason run. Now there\u2019s one more victory away from giving their Hall-of-Fame quarterback an attempt to pick up his second Super Bowl ring. This should be a good game, unlike most of the ones we had last weekend.

It\u2019s the LA Rams vs the New Orleans Saints at the Mercedes-Benz Superbowl. We\u2019re about a half-hour away from kickoff, but your humble host will be returning beforehand. Hunter will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s his preview of today\u2019s game: What the Rams need to do: The Rams need to keep relying on their running game. Everyone was expecting Todd Gurley to have a big game against the Dallas Cowboys last weekend but nobody was expecting CJ Anderson to outdo him, or for both running backs to pick up more than 100 yards each. Now the Saints defense will have to game plan for both men. What the Saints need to do: Get in front early. The Saints had to crawl out of a 14-0 hole against the Philadelphia Eagles last week. That\u2019s not going to work against a much tougher opponent in the Rams, who dominated in the first half against Dallas, going up 20-3 on their way to a 30-22 victory. Key player for the Rams: Aaron Donald, DT. Donald led the league in sacks during the regular season with 20.5, and is favorite to be named defensive player of the year. He\u2019s going to have his work cut out against Drew Brees, however. Donald managed a few tackles on the future hall of famer in their last meeting, but no sacks. Key player for the Saints: Michael Thomas, WR. Last time these two teams faced each other, Thomas accumulated 211 yards and scored a key touchdown late on. Last weekend, Thomas went off for 171 yards and yet another touchdown against the Eagles. He will be a factor again. Unheralded players to watch: The kickers. It doesn\u2019t get much more unheralded than being a kicker, but we\u2019ve already seen how important they can be in a winner-takes-all scenario. Just ask poor Cody Parkey, whose blocked field-goal ended the Chicago Bears\u2019 season. So, watch Rams kicker Greg Zuerlein and Saints kicker Wil Lutz. If casual football fans know one of their names after the game ends, that probably means something bad has happened. The usually reliable Lutz, in fact, nearly found himself the Saints\u2019 fall guy with his fourth-quarter miss against the Eagles, but the Saints were able to hold on to win 20-14. Prediction: Rams 24-28 Saints"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
