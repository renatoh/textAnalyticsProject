The London foursome must have wanted to lower expectations, and they've indubitably done that, which makes the music even more of a surprise. The band claim to have achieved their sound through a melange of Sufi poetry, non-western guitar tunings and an \"animal orchestra\", and that may even be true. Whatever the case, this is a dreamy, drifty debut influenced by girl groups and, inevitably, David Lynch. TTTs are not the only young group on the block to be melding detached female vocals, distant percussive rattles and guitar effects, all swaddled in a sonic fog, but they're better at it than most. Highlights include You Wish You Were Red and Candy Girl, both of which employ the bassline from the Twin Peaks theme to haunting effect, and the drugged-out electropop of Starlatine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
