The country's Ecology Minister described the risk of slicks hitting the coast over a period of months as 'a sword of Damocles that would hang over France for a long time'. Solaire Holidays, a tour operator based in Brittany where the huge Erika slick hit in 1999, warned that, years after an 'efficient and successful clean-up operation', client numbers haven't recovered."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
