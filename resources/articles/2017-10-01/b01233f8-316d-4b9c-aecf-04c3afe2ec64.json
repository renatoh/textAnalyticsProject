United take on Liverpool in the early kick-off conscious the greeting from the home fans will be hostile. Yet Mourinho is confident this can help his side. \u201cYou know this is quite funny for me because I think when people speak about big atmospheres, it looks like we don\u2019t like [this],\u201d United\u2019s manager said. \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s a problem for us to go to a certain place and to face a big atmosphere \u2013 [but] this is what we want. \u201cI am surprised that you speak about that in a negative way, I am even more surprised when I hear former, big players speak about atmospheres like something sinister, something that worries. It motivates us, it is something that we want, it is something that if we could have every match we would have every match.\u201d Mourinho used the recent game at the Camp Nou that was staged behind closed doors to reiterate his point. \u201cYou know, when Barcelona played against Las Palmas with an empty stadium, do you think the players were happy with that?\u201d said the Portuguese. \u201cDo you think Las Palmas players wouldn\u2019t prefer to play with Nou Camp full of people and a great atmosphere? We are speaking about Old Trafford, in this case Anfield, like it\u2019s a big problem. It\u2019s a satisfaction, that\u2019s what we want. I never see a player complain: \u2018Oh, this atmosphere was very strong\u2019 \u2013 we complain when the atmosphere is flat. \u201cWhen we play at home and we don\u2019t see big enthusiasm in the people, we complain. So we go to where we want to go, we go to play against a big team with a big tradition in an amazing stadium with great tradition. We know that the fans have huge animosity against Manchester United historically, but this is what we want so we are very happy to have one more opportunity in our careers to play in this beautiful conditions. It\u2019s beautiful to play at Anfield. Beautiful.\u201d United are second to Manchester City on goal difference. Mourinho was dismissive regarding whether Liverpool present his team\u2019s first real test as the highest finishers from last season that United will have played. \u201cIt is disrespectful to the opposition [we have played to say that]; not us, but for the opposition it\u2019s not nice,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody knows there are better teams than others and at the end of the season you have the proof of that: the champion, runner-up, third, fourth. I don\u2019t think these teams that aren\u2019t going to be champion or top four mind if everybody says that. But to say they\u2019re easy matches to win is a bit aggressive to them.\u201d Last season\u2019s corresponding fixture ended as a 0-0 draw and Mourinho joked about playing a fresh formation to ensure United attack with more flair. \u201cI will play with one defender and nine strikers, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d the 54-year-old said. \u201cWe play with one guy behind and then we go with the new system, even an evolution of the WM [old formation], and we play with nine strikers. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d He was more serious when asked whether Liverpool\u2019s status as United\u2019s fiercest rivals meant the boost of a victory could help his side\u2019s evolution. \u201cIf you win you\u2019re in a better position, if you lose you are in a worse position,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you win you are not champions and if you lose you don\u2019t lose your chance to be champion. You cannot win every match, and you have to be strong enough mentally, for both sides. If you win, you cannot leave Anfield like you won the Premier League, because you didn\u2019t; if you lose you cannot leave like you are going to be relegated.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
