In UK shops that use the technology, including supermarkets such as Waitrose, there were reports of long queues, and several businesses took to social media to advise customers to bring cash with them. The company\u2019s official Twitter accounts received a barrage of complaints from people caught short with no cash and from retailers unable to take payments. Verifone, which is one the largest providers of traditional card terminals in the world, confirmed the outage in a statement. \u201cEarlier today, we experienced a service outage that affected connectivity to our Wynid gateway in France, and Ocius gateway in the UK. Services are now back to normal, and both data centres are now receiving transactions. \u201cOur engineers are continuing their investigation to determine the root cause of the outage. We apologise for the disruption caused.\u201d Reading Football Club released a statement before its FA Cup match against Stevenage saying it could not take any card payments at Madejski Stadium. \u201cUnfortunately the technical issues are out of our control, however we would like to apologise to our fans for any inconvenience caused,\u201d it said. Everyman cinema also tweeted to customers: \u201cBring some cash money with you if you\u2019re visiting tonight, @Verifone are having some temporary card payment issues.\u201d Several Twitter users complained about the lack of communication. Luke Finnigan said: \u201cAre you down? Be helpful if you sent out a communication \u2026 Your helpdesk aren\u2019t answering the phones.\u201d A taxi driver, Pete McAuliffe, also tweeted the company to complain that he would not be able to work until the problem was fixed. \u201cSeeing as I have to take card payments by law as a London cabbie, your system failure means I can\u2019t work. It\u2019d be a good idea if you waived your excessive commissions this week.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
