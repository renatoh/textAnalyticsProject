Among those pubs that did open, sales on 4 July and 5 July were 45% below pre-Covid levels, the analysis found. According to the Coffer Peach Business Tracker, which collates sales figures from 32 pub chains, about four out of 10 chain pubs began serving drinks again last weekend after being closed for nearly four months. Restaurants were far less likely than pubs to resume normal service. Just 12% of chain venues opened their doors over the reopening weekend, reporting sales 41% below normal. \u201cTrading at around 55% of pre-Covid norms may seem a disappointing result, and it won\u2019t be profitable for operators, but it is very much in line with what we have seen in other markets,\u201d said Karl Chessell, director of CGA, the consultancy that produces the data with the Coffer Group and the audit group RSM. \u201cWhen bars and restaurants began reopening in the US during May, it was only after a couple of weeks that sales reached 54% of pre-Covid levels. \u201cIt is going to take time for the trade to return but this provides a foundation on which to build consumer confidence and adapt and improve operations.\u201d Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a multibillion pound package to support the hospitality industry on Wednesday, including a government-funded meal discount scheme and a VAT reduction to 5% for food and soft drinks. But pubs that rely on alcohol sales have warned that they face closure after being excluded from the support. \u2022 Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
