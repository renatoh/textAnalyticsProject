Sturridge is in contention to start his first Liverpool game since August when Tottenham Hotspur visit Anfield on Tuesday, a game Rodgers believes will have a major bearing on his side\u2019s prospects of qualifying for the Champions League. Liverpool have won their last three meetings against Spurs 3-0, 4-0 and 5-0 but Rodgers insists Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s team are a different proposition to the one beaten comfortably in Sturridge\u2019s last Premier League start due to the emergence of Kane and Ryan Mason. The Liverpool manager believes England recognition is inevitable for Spurs\u2019 22-goal forward, but is adamant no homegrown forward compares to Sturridge at present. Rodgers said: \u201cI\u2019m sure Daniel is happy there\u2019s another English striker coming through because if Harry Kane is going to be of the level to play for England, which I believe he is, then that helps Daniel and the other Liverpool players who play for England because it means you get another top quality striker. \u201cBut for me there\u2019s not anyone better than Daniel Sturridge. There\u2019s no one better. He\u2019s got everything in his game if he\u2019s playing consistently. His goalscoring record, his pace, his power, he\u2019s got everything and as an English striker there\u2019s no one better than him. I\u2019m sure Daniel will look at it that there\u2019s another young English striker coming through and that will really help him when they come together at international level.\u201d Liverpool will be without the influential Lucas Leiva on Tuesday after the midfielder suffered a thigh injury at Everton. He could be ruled out for an extended period. \u201cHe has been very important for us,\u201d rued Rodgers, who is unlikely to ask Emre Can to replace Lucas in midfield due to the German\u2019s commanding form in defence. Rodgers, who met representatives from the club\u2019s owners, Fenway Sports Group, at Melwood on Monday, said: \u201cEventually Emre will play further forward but you have to consider the balance of the team, which is very, very good at the moment. \u201cIt\u2019s four clean sheets at the moment and defensively we have been very strong. With Emre you can see the importance of his role and the position he plays in there. He was immense at the weekend in a real physical game. Why disrupt that to try and fix something that could actually create another problem? The balance of the team is fine at the moment.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
