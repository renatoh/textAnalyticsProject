The small inheritance that her father left her is shrinking like a stabbed balloon, because she put it into a silly Isa and the stock market has plummeted to new bottoms. Her big mistake was to ignore the forests of paper that her building society/bank/pension sends her. Instead of recklessly throwing it all aside, she should have spent hours on end reading it extra carefully. Then she would have noticed in the itsy-witsy print that her money had been invested in hopeless causes, the several advisers whom she foolishly heeded were talking out of their rectums and she was heading for skid row. But she never did her reading, because after just one page she was bored to death and could scarcely understand a word of it anyway. Neither can I. Sometimes I try to have a little read and look at the numbers, but the brain glazes over, I stuff the papers away in a box and read a comic instead. Fielding doesn't even open his envelopes. He was offered shares once and given a choice of three types: hardcore-greedy-bastard-bugger-the-environment (really profitable), ethical (high-risk, flumpence profit), or a blend of greed, caution and ethical (treading water but guilt-free). In the end he frittered all his money on a new kitchen and now lives a hand-to-mouth existence, free of investment worries. A clever move. But Mavis's story has given me a bit of a fright. Do I still have any savings or pension? I scrabbled through boxes of documents and glared at the numbers. I glared for days, eyes watering, brain aching and, sure enough, the numbers have gone down. I have less than I had last year. How come? It clearly says I have a bonus. The bonus has been added to my pension. How do you contribute regularly and add a bonus to something, which then becomes less than it was? I phone for a telephone explanation and explanatory pamphlet. After hours of listening and glaring I learn only one thing: these explanations are specially designed to make me feel an incompetent clot, desperate enough to entrust everything to the money persons, so they can play with my savings in peace until there's nothing left. Whoever said it was foolish to hide your money under the mattress?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
