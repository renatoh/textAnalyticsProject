On July 27 1942, a German aircraft dropped one of the few enemy bombs to fall on Cambridge during the second world war. It fell on a house in Ram Yard - where Byron once kept a bear - and Freddie was badly injured. She was trapped by burning timbers, her injuries necessitating the amputation of both her legs below the knees. The events of that night shaped her life and those of her closest family and friends. Freddie was born Winifred Lambert in Liverpool, the youngest of four children. Her father was a customs official and her mother a schoolteacher. Bright and articulate, she won scholarships to Merchant Taylors' school for girls in Crosby, where she was head girl, and Newnham College, Cambridge, where she read geography and won a hockey blue. Like so many of her undergraduate generation, she joined the Communist party, later becoming secretary of the CP-controlled University Labour Federation. Michael Orram's films of the Cambridge left in the 1930s capture her in full flow, addressing a meeting along with my father Arnold Kettle, who was to be a lifelong friend. At Cambridge in 1939, Freddie met James Oswald Vickers, known to his intimates as Mouse and later to become a civil service trade union activist. When war was declared they were, typically, together at a miners' camp in Wales. They married in February 1940, but in April Mouse was captured in northern France and held as a PoW until he escaped just before the end of the war. The bomb that transformed Freddie's life became an iconic event for her peers. Her courage in the face of pain and trauma was celebrated in communist literature of the time; an account of her reaction to suffering is extensively quoted in Eric Hobsbawm's autobiography. Thinking she was about to die, Freddie called out to her would-be rescuers: \"My feet, it's burning my feet, it's no good, I'm done for. Long live the party. Goodbye, boys.\" Such words seem inconceivable now, but as Hobsbawm says, they would not have been surprising in their time and place. Freddie's letters from hospital perpetuate the more human, humorous and even flirtatious side of her courage. As she recovered, first at Adden-brooke's and then at a military hospital in Roehampton, she became an informal counsellor to wounded soldiers. After the war, she trained as a social worker at the London School of Economics, where she received a distinction, and became a psychiatric social worker, first in Stoke-on-Trent, then at the Hammersmith hospital, and at the Paddington clinic and day hospital, where she worked with the child psychoanalyst Michael Fordham. She became a lecturer in social work at Chiswick Polytechnic (later the West London Institute of Higher Education). After the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956, Freddie left the Communist party - though she never broke with her communist friends - and later joined the Labour party, remaining active until Alzheimer's disease prevented it any longer. She continued to swim, drove a car with her hands, and on family holidays in the 1950s, I remember her joining in Scottish country dancing on the sands of Cornwall and Galloway. She loved to join Mouse on bird-watching expeditions, tended her gardens in Brentford and in Somerset, and was an avid reader and music-lover. Her presence was a magnet at any party she attended. Her greatest joy and pride were Mouse and her children Salley and James, who survive her, as do four grandchildren and one great-grandchild. \u00b7 Winfred Mary (Freddie) Vickers, socialist and social worker, born September 4 1918; died March 23 2006."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
