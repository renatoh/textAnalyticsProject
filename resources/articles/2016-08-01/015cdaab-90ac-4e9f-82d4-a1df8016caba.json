The Commonwealth Bank said on Wednesday that its full-year profit after tax was $9.45bn, an increase of 3% on last year, driven by soaring earnings in its retail and small business lending. But the cost of bad debts jumped 27% from a year ago to $1.26bn, largely due to exposures to the resources, commodity and dairy sectors. The bank will pay a fully franked final dividend of $2.22 per share. The result comes a week after the major banks failed to pass on in full the Reserve Bank\u2019s rate cut to mortgage holders, triggering a heated political debate about the power of the industry and the impact it was having on the economy. Former Reserve Bank board member John Edwards joined the chorus of critical voices last week in calling for some type of inquiry into the banks, saying their relative power had increased significantly in recent years and it had to be reckoned with. \u201cTheir authority in [funds management] is becoming vastly bigger than it was, even a decade ago,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cI think that\u2019s where we need to get a better idea of what the culture is, and where the performance and practice is.\u201d Labor now plans to focus its political attention on the role of credit card interest rates and the difficulty customers have switching between banks. Senator Sam Dastyari said a little-noticed fact from last week\u2019s RBA rate cut controversy was that the major banks failed to pass on any of the rate cut to credit card holders. The gap between credit card interest rates and the RBA cash rate is now more than 18% \u2013 the largest it has been in 27 years since data has been kept. \u201cWe all keep talking about the failure of banks to pass on interest rate cuts for mortgage holders but there\u2019s been nothing substantial passed on for credit cards for years now,\u201d he said. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said on Tuesday the banks were being \u201cpoorly advised\u201d if they thought posting record profits in this environment was a good idea. Ian Narev, the CBA\u2019s chief executive, said after releasing the results that the bank was \u201ccognisant\u201d of stronger competition and increasing regulation\u201d but did not address the growing clamour for banking reform. \u201cIncome growth inside and outside Australia remains weak, so people are not feeling better off,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen combined with on-going global economic and political uncertainty this makes households and businesses cautious, and hesitant to respond to monetary stimulus. \u201cAt CBA, we are cognisant of the combined impact of weaker demand, strong competition and increasing regulation. An on-going focus on productivity and credit quality will be important. \u201cWe will continue to manage for the long term, putting customers first and investing for the future.\u201d Malcolm Turnbull last week said the banks ought to pass all RBA rate cuts in full to customers but, after they ignored him, he announced the chiefs of the major banks would be required to appear at a parliamentary committee annually to explain their actions on interest rates and other behaviour. He said that would ensure the banks were regularly accountable to elected members in the same way as the RBA or the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority. Since the banks will be asked to appear before the House committee on economics, it means they will avoid the scrutiny of the Senate where longtime campaigners on bank behaviour, such as the Nationals senator John Williams, Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson and Dastyari reside. Turnbull said on Tuesday the parliamentary committee would be chaired by the Liberal MP David Coleman, the federal member for Banks in New South Wales. \u201cThe hearings will provide an open and transparent environment in which to address issues related to the banking system,\u201d Coleman said in a statement. Rod Sims, the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, said he was looking forward to a Productivity Commission review of competition in the banking sector, flagged by the Coalition in response to the financial system inquiry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
