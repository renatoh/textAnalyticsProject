As politicians at Stormont hold talks to save power sharing and devolution from collapse, the survey for the Economic and Social Research Council reveals that just under 45% agree there will be lasting peace in Northern Ireland. The poll was conducted face to face with 1,810 voters just five weeks after the general election in May by Social Market Research Belfast. Researchers were from Liverpool and Aberdeen universities, the London School of Economics and Queen\u2019s University Belfast, making the survey one of the most wide-ranging in years. Despite the lack of faith in the durability of the peace process among around 55% of those interviewed, there still remains strong support both for power-sharing government and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). Support for the PSNI was almost 67%, while an similar figure (65%) backed the power-sharing arrangement in Northern Ireland, which at present is in peril due to allegations that the Provisional IRA still exists and is still killing on the streets of Belfast. The survey shows that a majority of people support the principle of consent on Northern Ireland\u2019s continued membership of the UK. Around 65% agreed or strongly agreed with the assertion that Northern Ireland should remain part of the UK so long as a majority in the region wished to do so. The poll comes as Northern Ireland\u2019s first minister, Peter Robinson, warned on Wednesday that his party would walk out of Stormont\u2019s devolved, power-sharing government unless the assembly is either suspended or adjourned. The crisis has been caused by allegations of Provisional IRA nvolvement in the murder of Kevin McGuigan. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) arrested three senior Belfast republicans on Wednesday in connection with the killing. Of those surveyed in the poll, only one in five believed there would be a united Ireland within the next 20 years, the poll finds. This figure shows a lowering of expectation about Northern Ireland uniting with the Republic compared to the earlier years of the peace process. A similar opinion poll by the Northern Ireland Life and Times survey in 1998 after the Good Friday agreement found double the number of people then polled believed Irish unity would come about in the next two decades. On social issues, the new poll shows that 52.7% of the public support gay marriage in Northern Ireland. The region is the only part of the UK where same-sex marriage is not legal. Unionists have blocked attempts by Sinn F\u00e9in and other politicians in the Stormont assembly to legalise gay marriage. On Wednesday, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Ivan Lewis, called for a province-wide referendum on the issue modelled on the historic gay marriage referendum across the border in the Irish Republic in May, which was endorsed by two thirds of the southern Irish electorate. A total of 65.3% of the 18-29 age bracket wanted gay marriage laws introduced, the survey found. Northern Ireland is also unique within the UK as it is the only region where abortion is illegal in all but a few exceptional circumstances. The largest share of voters surveyed in the poll \u2013 44.3% \u2013 supported legalising abortion, with a small but significant number undecided. Among affluent voters, defined as those earning \u00a330,000 or more, there was strong support for liberalising abortion laws with 58.6% backing reform. More than a quarter of those polled (27.1%) regarded themselves as victims of the Troubles. Support was also low for an amnesty for those who carried out acts of violence during the Troubles. Only 14.5% overall from both communities supported an amnesty. One of the academics behind the project, Dr Peter Shirlow of the University of Liverpool, said the specific findings on attitudes towards a united Ireland and the more liberal attitude of younger people to gay rights and abortion contained lessons in particular for unionist politicians. \u201cWhat the survey may suggest is that unionist parties need to understand that the dynamics of the community from which they traditionally gain votes is changing towards increasingly liberal opinions and attitudes. \u201cAnd if unionists wish to prevent Irish unification they will at some point need votes or abstentions from sections of the Catholic community. If that is the case they will have to offer more liberal politics, business agendas and outlooking inter-community thinking,\u201d Shirlow said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
