The Tree Council and the National Trust, acting in concert, identified 10 of the best properties where an autumn wander through the woods could be rewarding and I came to this one, Horner Wood, on the Bristol Channel coast by Dunkery Beacon. The Holnicote estate was a gift from the Acland family to the trust in 1944 and Horner Wood is only a part, albeit 800 acres, of the 20 sq miles, which includes 14 tenanted farms. On a splendid morning of autumn sunshine Nigel Hester, the countryside manager for the NT, took me up the East Water valley to some very old oak trees, the health of which owes a great deal to the 200-year-old pollarding, which has created their splayed form. With the close company of four Exmoor ponies grazing nearby, I inspected an ancient oak with polypoda fern decorating its branches through moss covering. When another oak close by lost a limb, the age rings on the cut surface proved it to be over 700 years old. So these are very old woodlands indeed, mainly of sessile oak, and owe a lot to the warm and moist oceanic climate on this coastal stretch. We climbed high to get the view northwards down the valley and across a blue sea to Wales. The foothills of the Brecon Beacons were at the limit of visibility. The wood is also a splendid wildlife refuge. Bats do particularly well here and we walked a broad path where mist nets are set to enable tagging and identification sessions, which show that 14 of the 16 varieties of the bats resident in Britain are found here. Bechstein's, Daubenton's and barbastelles are the rarest of British bats and all occur here. As sunlight gave way to a heavy shower we retreated to Porlock for a pub lunch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
