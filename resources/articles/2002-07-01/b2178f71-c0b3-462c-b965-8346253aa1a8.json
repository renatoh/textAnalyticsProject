The crown defended the conviction of Barry George, arguing that there was \"no lurking doubt\" about the case and that the original sentence was \"safe\". But George's lawyers argued that the conviction represented a miscarriage of justice because jurors ignored the trial judge's orders to stop debating the case when they retired to a hotel in the evenings. Opening his submission on behalf of the crown, Orlando Pownall QC said criticisms made of the handling of the case by trial judge Mr Justice Gage were \"without foundation\". The jury was \"perfectly entitled to reach the safe conclusion\" that George murdered Dando, Mr Pownall told the lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, sitting with Mr Justice Curtis and Mr Justice Henriques. \"This is not a lurking doubt case,\" he said. \"Based upon a careful consideration of all the evidence, the jury were perfectly entitled to reach the safe conclusion that this appellant and no other murdered Jill Dando. \"In the light of the compelling circumstantial and other evidence, it is further submitted that there is no basis whatsoever for this court to interfere with the jury's verdict.\" Mr Pownall rebutted claims by Michael Mansfield QC that the conviction was unsafe because identification evidence used at the trial was inadmissible and should have led to the proceedings being halted. He said the crown disagreed with the suggestion that the identification evidence in the case was \"tenuous\", and instead called it \"the foundation stone\" of the crown's case. Mr Pownall said that in any event the case involved \"two unimpeachable positive identifications\" and forensic evidence - a single speck of firearms residue found in George's coat pocket lining - that \"clearly did, or was capable of, supporting the identification evidence\". He said there was no evidence that the murder was committed by a professional hitman, and the suggestion that there was a Serb or some other professional assassin nearby was \"totally absurd\". But Mr Mansfield claimed that jurors might wrongly have continued deliberating on the guilt or innocence of George during their stay over five nights at a hotel. If this had happened it could have given rise to a miscarriage of justice, he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
