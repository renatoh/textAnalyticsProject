First seen in Texas in 2001, it is a mixture of ghost story, prose poem and paean to nature. Even if I found much of it impenetrable, I was impressed by Jessica Lazar\u2019s production and the discipline of its performers. We are confronted by three largely chair-bound figures who inhabit a deserted trailer park due for demolition. In the middle is Irene, an immured 25-year-old mother who spends her days licking stamps and who claims: \u201cOutside is a state of mind.\u201d On her right is her home-educated, imaginative 10-year-old daughter, Annabella. The third figure, who gives the play its title, is a shape-shifting creature who the daughter \u2013 like the golem of Jewish myth \u2013 has made out of mud and becomes both her alter ego and an embodiment of animalistic wildness. This last character is reminiscent of the protagonist of Caryl Churchill\u2019s The Skriker and, if I understand the play correctly, it suggests that mortals need to absorb her adaptability and capacity for change. That\u2019s only an educated guess. What really hit me was the sonic variety of Lazar\u2019s production: pots, pans, cups and domestic utensils are struck to create a world of gothic ghoulishness. The actors are also striking. Beverly Rudd, as the mother, has the right mix of protectiveness and self-absorption, Gabrielle Brooks, her daughter, evokes a longing for the wild woods, and Natasha Cottriall, playing her mud-made creation, is all unearthly mischief. Since D\u2019Amour has penned a poetic hymn to American transcendentalism, rather than a cry of rage at materialist progress, you could say she writes more in Thoreau than in anger. At the Arcola, London, until 12 October."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
