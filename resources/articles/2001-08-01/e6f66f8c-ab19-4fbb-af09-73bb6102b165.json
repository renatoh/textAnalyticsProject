The taboos have been reversed: they confronted death in a way we never do, while we are obsessed with sex, and they preferred not to talk about it. But how far down do these differences really go? Dig deeper into any period, and human passions, devices and desires bridge the gulf. This is what Judith Flanders does in her debut biography, A Circle of Sisters, which gives an extraordinarily vivid sense of what it was like to be alive a century ago. She shows the Victorians to be the instigators of a world in which, for the first time, it was who you were and not where you came from that mattered. The novelty of this lively and well-researched biography is that Flanders does not focus on the lives of famous men, or even famous women. Her subject is the intertwined lives of \"four women of little fortune\". The Macdonald sisters, Alice, Georgiana, Agnes and Louisa, started life as daughters of a poor Methodist minister, \"middle-class by the skin of their teeth\". Yet Alice became the mother of Rudyard Kipling and Georgie the wife of the pre-Raphaelite painter Edward Burne-Jones; Agnes was the mother of prime minister Stanley Baldwin, while Louise married Edward Poynter, an art-world worthy and minor painter who presided over both the Royal Academy and the National Gallery. Flanders paints a vivid picture of their childhood. The girls were all bright and strong personalities, known for their wit, which could \"turn to savage in the blink of an eye\". As they grew up, one by one they left home to marry: each sister provides a window on to a different world, and it is a mark of the bravery of this biography that it is not afraid to take them all on. The Macdonald parents, George and Hannah, had nine children; two sons died as babies and a daughter, Carrie, died of tuberculosis, aged 15. We know that both infant mortality and consumption were all too common, but did that make it any easier to bear? Flanders questions everything, exploding many of the myths about Victorian sensibilities. Hannah's letters to her eldest son Harry, away at school, reveal that she thought of her lost children every day of her life. Harry was the apple of his parents' eye. They scrimped and saved to send him to school, while the girls for the most part made do with Hannah's teaching at home. This was when she was not focused on \"the heroic task\" of running the house and keeping it clean (Flanders provides a detailed account of exactly what this involved). Despite all their hopes for the rather priggish Harry, he turned out to be a sad disappointment, dropping out of university and emigrating to the US, to his parents' lasting grief. It was the girls who had the brains in this family. Georgie, often depicted as the long-suffering wife of the highly strung and unfaithful Burne-Jones, emerges as the kindest of the sisters, with a great gift for friendship. She was an intimate of George Eliot, although the friendship was sorely tested when Eliot married John Cross, 20 years her junior. Georgie and Alice, Kipling's mother, are the best-developed characters in this tale, arguably because they were the dominant ones in the family. As we learn in more depth about Georgie's side of the Pre-Raphaelite story, the facile \"Angel in the House\" version of her character is replaced by something altogether more interesting. She was deeply hurt by Burne-Jones's love affair with the Greek sculptor Maria Zambaco, which nearly ended in a suicide pact between the lovers. Georgie left her husband for a while, taking their two children with her. But later she confided to a friend, Rosalind Howard, that for Edward she had \"love enough to last out a long life\". She appears to have forgiven him not because she had no choice, but because she loved him. Again, Flanders finds a detail which does not turn up in most biographies. In the 1860s, while Burne-Jones was immersed in his affair, Rosalind wrote to a mutual friend about \"Edward's living apart\" - which, she said, \"he does for her [Georgie's] good so as to avoid many children, but it is a mistake\". These small details make new sense of the well-known story of William Morris's unrequited love for Georgie. (He sent her a thinly disguised fictional love letter about two brothers in love with the daughter of a Methodist minister, and took her failure to respond as a rejection.) Meanwhile, we gain a different perspective on Kipling's childhood in India by looking at his mother. Although Alice was something of a flirt and a \"serial fianc\u00e9e\" in her youth, the first time she clapped eyes on Lockwood Kipling, her fate was sealed. Her marriage took her far from home and the closeness of her sisters. Clearly she was often lonely in the class-ridden Anglo-Indian society. Lockwood's quite humble position as an art teacher barred them from the A list and the smartest parties. As well as her sisters, Alice desperately missed the company of Rudyard and his little sister, Trix; we know this from her sad little poems of the time. But Alice and Lockwood decided to leave the children, aged four and six, with strangers, without telling them that they were returning to India. Kipling never forgot nor forgave the appalling mental and physical cruelty he and Trix suffered at the hands of the dreadful couple with whom they boarded in Southsea. His story \"Baa Baa, Black Sheep\" leaves us in no doubt as to his bitterness at the humiliation he went through, forced to wear placards emblazoned with the word \"liar\". Flanders is careful not to minimise this trauma both for Alice and Rudyard, but she puts it in context. This was a time when it was routine for children to suffer abuse that would today be classed as criminal. More interestingly, Flanders suggests that Alice did not ask her sisters to look after her children while she and her husband were in India because they all lived in much better circumstances, and she felt it would be bad for her children to become too aware of this. There is an ironic postscript to her anxiety: as Flanders points out, Burne-Jones and Poynter were success stories whose children were content to live off the reputation of their fathers. \"The children of the businessman and the art teacher became a prime minister and the uncrowned poet laureate of empire.\" \u0095 Rachel Barnes is the author of The Pre-Raphaelites and Their World (Tate)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
