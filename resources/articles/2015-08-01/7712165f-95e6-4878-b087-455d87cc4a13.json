But meanwhile back in the tiny town of Plains, Georgia, residents of Carter\u2019s hometown had decided on a tribute of their own: hundreds of campaign signs lining the streets to which Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, were to return on Thursday evening. \u201cJimmy Carter for Cancer Survivor,\u201d signs said, urging the former president success in this latest battle. \u201cIf we can put a smile on his face, it\u2019s worth it,\u201d Jill Stuckey, a close friend of the former first couple and a board member of the Friends of Jimmy Carter National Historic Site, told the Atlanta Journal Constitution. She told the paper they had the idea last week, when similar signs were featured in a Journal Constitution editorial cartoon by Mark Luckovich. It was to Plains \u2013 population just under 800, according to the 2010 census \u2013 where Carter returned in 1981, after losing a brutal re-election campaign against Ronald Reagan. When in town, he still teaches Sunday school at the Maranatha Baptist church. He said on Thursday he intends to teach this weekend, as scheduled. \u2022 This article was corrected on 21 August 2015. It previously referred to Barack Obama as a former president."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
