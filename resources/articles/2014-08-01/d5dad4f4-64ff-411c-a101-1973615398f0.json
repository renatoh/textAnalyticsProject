In a report on the UK\u2019s development work in the occupied territories (OPTs), the international development committee (IDC) argues that Israel\u2019s policies \u2013 which include restrictions on building, access to water, and 3G and 4G for Palestinian mobile providers \u2013 are proving seriously counterproductive. Members of the committee said they had been shocked by what they had seen during a visit in March. \u201cWe saw a country whose people have known immense suffering now imposing conditions on their Palestinian neighbours which cause a different but very real suffering and often without real security justification,\u201d says the report. \u201cWe saw Israel taking a range of actions that hinder Palestinian economic development and must, at the very least, cause deep resentment on the Palestinian side, even amongst the most moderate and pragmatic people, and so will actually worsen Israel\u2019s own security.\u201d Such restrictions, the report adds, are stymying economic development and fuelling anger. \u201cIn Gaza, from where rockets have been indiscriminately launched on Israel, restrictions, in particular on movements, are even more severe than on the West Bank: ordinary Gazans are not generally allowed to leave Gaza, whilst trade is heavily restricted.\u201d Noting that Israel is a democracy with a strong entrepreneurial culture, the committee says much could be achieved if the country would also allow Palestinian businesses to grow and flourish. It cited a World Bank report from last year, which suggested that Palestinian GDP could rise by nearly a quarter if Palestinian firms were allowed to invest in Area C, a part of the West Bank controlled exclusively by Israel. However, the World Bank report claimed that \u201cthe manner in which Area C is currently administered virtually precludes Palestinian businesses from investing there\u201d. The committee heard that many Palestinians wishing to build in Area C do so without obtaining permits from the Israeli authorities as they fear their applications will be delayed or refused. Although Oxfam told the IDC that only 37 of the 1,640 applications submitted between 2009 and 2012 were granted, Israel\u2019s UK embassy told the committee that more than 300 Palestinian development plans had been approved in Area C, including medical facilities, roads and water, and electricity lines. Such contradictions were common, according to the IDC, which said: \u201cA lot of the evidence we were given on our visit is difficult to reconcile with that subsequently provided by the Israeli embassy.\u201d The Department for International Development (DfID) has budgeted more than \u00a3343m for its operation in Palestine between 2011 and 2015. Although the IDC conceded that its role was to examine the effectiveness of DfID\u2019s programmes rather than comment on foreign policy, it said that Palestinian economic development could not be put on indefinite hold while the much-thwarted search for peace continued. \u201cThe conflict between Hamas and Israel and the stalling of the peace talks should not prevent the UK and other European countries from pressing Israel to end unnecessary restrictions, especially in the West Bank,\u201d said Sir Malcolm Bruce, the committee\u2019s chairman. \u201cIn particular, we challenge the assertion that restrictions which curtail economic development in the OPTs are based on Israel\u2019s security needs and can be justified on security grounds \u2026 While we fully appreciate Israel\u2019s security concerns, these in no way justify the present restrictions on Palestinians in Hebron, which affect their livelihoods, economic development and security.\u201d The report urges the British government to encourage both sides to negotiate over mobile phone services, construction permits and demolitions, and access to the West Bank aquifer. It also calls on the UK to take a tough stance on the issue of Israel\u2019s illegal settlements in Palestine. \u201cThe presence of the settlements, and the consequent inability of Palestinians in Area C to control their own resources, severely restrict the Palestinian economy,\u201d the report says. \u201cThe UK should in concert with other European countries stress to the Israeli authorities the unacceptability of the present situation.\u201d Although the IDC recognises Israel\u2019s \u201clegitimate security concerns\u201d following recent events and rocket attacks from Gaza, it does not believe that \u201call the present arrangements, notably those which affect travel and trade are proportionate\u201d, adding: \u201cSome are contrary to Israel\u2019s obligations under international law and also run the risk of making the security situation worse.\u201d The report says the British government should ask Israel to improve water and electricity supplies in Gaza and suggests that DfID increase its work to support exports from Gaza and help implement plans to open Gaza\u2019s port. A government spokesman said: \u201cWe welcome the IDC\u2019s strong support for our work on economic development in the OPTs and agree that sustainable development can only happen if economic restrictions are eased. \u201cWe will continue our work to help strengthen Palestinian institutions and build a prosperous and stable future Palestinian state. We are also committed to lasting change in Gaza, though we recognise that reconstruction and growth cannot happen until we have a durable ceasefire.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
