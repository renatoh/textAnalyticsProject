Anthony Whealy, a judge with lengthy experience in NSW\u2019s highest courts, has warned that the secret prosecution and imprisonment of a man in the Australian Capital Territory poses serious questions about the future of the justice system. \u201cAt first blush, this looks like the complete abandonment of open justice,\u201d Whealy told Guardian Australia. \u201cAre we now a totalitarian state where people are prosecuted, convicted and shunted off to prison without they or the public having any notion as to what has happened?\u201d Proceedings against the Canberra man, understood to be a former military intelligence officer, were hidden from the public. He was sentenced to imprisonment and began serving time in the Alexander Maconochie Centre at some point in 2018, before being released this year. The nature of the charges has been kept secret, as has his name, identity, and background. He was restricted in his communications with friends and family while behind bars, and the Australian federal police asked the prison to tip it off if he attempted to receive any \u201cunusual visitors\u201d. Whealy said it was difficult to debate the case because so little was known about it. \u201cIs this a portent for the future of our trial system?\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately we cannot debate the merits of this, precisely because we are not allowed to know what has happened. Another victim to the greedy jaws of national security?\u201d The Law Council of Australia\u2019s president, Arthur Moses SC, said he could not comment on the specifics of the case but described open justice as one of the \u201cfundamental attributes of a fair trial\u201d. \u201cSecrecy or suppression is only ever appropriate where the rare exceptions to open justice have been appropriately considered and applied,\u201d Moses told Guardian Australia. The secrecy surrounding the case has been imposed by commonwealth orders. Those orders \u2013 themselves not publicly available \u2013 prevent the identification of the inmate or the publication of the charges he faced. Not even the boss of the ACT prison saw copies of the orders. Moses said a wide-ranging review was needed of secrecy provisions in federal legislation. \u201cThe Law Council believes a thorough review of all existing secrecy offences across federal legislation should be conducted, taking into account the set of principles contained in the Australia Law Reform Commission\u2019s report, Secrecy Laws and Open Government in Australia.\u201d The case only came to light because of a dispute between the inmate and prison authorities. Their dispute centred on a memoir the inmate had written about his experiences of jail, which he said contained no details of the crimes he was convicted of. The inmate sought to receive a visit from the Canberra-based author Robert Macklin, who he hoped would help him publish his memoir. The request for Macklin\u2019s visit prompted the prison\u2019s general manager to contact the AFP, who then raided the inmate\u2019s cell and his brother\u2019s home, then temporarily froze his phone and email communications. He sought a judicial review of the prison\u2019s actions in the ACT supreme court, which heard the matter in closed court and then published a judgment rejecting the inmate\u2019s application. The judgment was released but contained no detail about the man\u2019s identity, his crimes or his background."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
