And now, the self-portrait that secured Andy Warhol\u2019s move from artist to celebrity \u2013 his inaugural \u201cselfie\u201d \u2013 is to be sold at auction for the first time. The print from 1963 was created using an image of Warhol taken in a standard New York dime store photo booth, and was the beginning of the artist\u2019s own face becoming a distinctive feature of his artwork until he died. The work will go on sale at Sotheby\u2019s in London, the first time it has ever been sold at auction, having been in a personal collection since the 1980s. It is expected to sell for about \u00a37m. While the phenomenon of the selfie is relatively new, it draws on the cult of celebrity Warhol was obsessed with, and the age of Instagram and social media makes his now-notorious proclamation that \u201cin the future everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes\u201d seem extremely prescient. Sotheby\u2019s senior specialist in contemporary art, James Sevier, said: \u201cThe artist\u2019s first self-portraits \u2013 created using a strip of photographs taken in a New York dime store photo booth \u2013 have never felt more relevant to contemporary culture.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is a work of immense art historical importance that marks the watershed moment when Warhol joined the canon of the greatest self-portraitists.\u201d By the time he turned the camera on himself, Warhol had already made his distinctive portraits of figures such as Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor and Elvis Presley, and his own star as a celebrity, was rising. The self-portrait idea was suggested by art dealer Ivan Karp, who told Warhol: \u201cYou know, people want to see you. Your looks are responsible for a certain part of your fame, they feed the imagination.\u201d After the work was done, Warhol was taken with the blurred line between his own persona and identity and the art he created, and his later self-portraits reflect the growing concerns he had with mortality. The use of a photo booth was also very fitting for Warhol, said Alex Branczik, Sotheby\u2019s head of contemporary art in Europe. \u201cThose photo booths are great levellers,\u201d said Branczik. \u201cWhoever you are in society, whether you are a struggling artist, a student or a successful businessman, everybody has to sit in those photo booths at some point and have their photos taken, in exactly the same format, in exactly the same way. This was an idea that really appealed to Warhol, who was a great democratiser.\u201d Branczik said the first self-portrait was a reminder of how relevant Warhol\u2019s works, and reflections on culture, celebrity and narcissism, remained today, and said the artist would have fitted in well in today\u2019s society. \u201cWarhol would love a good selfie stick I think,\u201d he said.
