The first was that Steve Harmison conclusively demonstrated himself to be fit and in form; the second is the knowledge that, unless Danish Kaneria picks up an injury, Mushtaq Ahmed will not be playing for Pakistan this summer. For Durham of course, there can be no consolation in either thought. The eight overs for 13 runs which Harmison reeled off on the bounce into a cold, stiff wind in the morning session were quick, accurate and, on a seaming wicket, deservedly rewarded with three wickets. \"He bowled beautifully,\" acknowledged the Sussex captain Chris Adams, and the fast bowler's selection for the third Test, which starts at Trent Bridge next week, would now seem to be a given. But then came Mushtaq. Harmison's bowling having played the major part in restricting Sussex's first innings lead to 119, the Durham openers had taken the score to 47 off 16 overs when Adams threw the ball to the little leg-spinner. His first two balls were played respectfully enough by Jimmy Maher. The third, a little wider, the Australian tried to cut and the edge was brilliantly caught by Adams in front of his face at first slip. Gordon Muchall propped forward to be lbw to the next delivery and Gary Pratt, having survived the hat-trick ball, top-edged an attempted sweep at the final ball of the over and skied to square-leg. Adams immediately brought back his other Pakistan international bowler, Rana Naved, at the other end. Having gone wicketless in his first spell, Rana switched up a gear and began to reverse-swing the ball. Dale Benkenstein and Gareth Breese both edged seaming deliveries to Adams and Rana was too fast for Phil Mustard, Ottis Gibson and, to end the match, Mick Lewis. Jon Lewis and Graham Onions, meanwhile, had both charged desperately down the track at Mushtaq and been stumped. Ten wickets had fallen in 13.1 overs and Sussex had their fourth championship victory on the trot. Adams was still shaking his head half an hour later. \"It was a very, very difficult pitch for any batsman to feel in on and a good pitch for Mushy to bowl on but for 10 wickets to fall in under an hour was extraordinary,\" he said. \"He usually gets his wickets through deceiving batsmen in channels just outside off-stump, rather than great spin, but on a pitch with a bit of pace, and in this case bounce, he becomes a very difficult prospect.\" Mushtaq's 10 wickets in the match, for 37 runs, was almost matched by Naved's nine for 70, and the two men have now taken 65 wickets in Sussex's five championship matches this season. \"They've been fantastic,\" said Adams. \"Historically we've always been poor starters in the championship and one of our aims this season was to get off to a flyer. We've delivered 100% on that and, when the wickets get firmer and more conducive to spin and our batsmen can start getting in and making big scores, we'll be hoping to push on.\" By then Naved will be playing against England and Mushtaq has not given up on his international prospects. \"My hunger is still there. Danish is a great bowler and obviously he is younger and has more future but I am always available,\" he said. \"But Sussex feels like my second home now. The great thing is we all back each other up; it's a real team effort.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
