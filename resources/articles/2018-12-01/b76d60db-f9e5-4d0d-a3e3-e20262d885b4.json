The end of the first week of the UN climate talks \u2013 known as COP24 \u2013 in Katowice, Poland, has been mired by protracted debate over whether the conference should \u201cwelcome\u201d or \u201cnote\u201d a key report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The IPCC\u2019s 1.5 degrees report, released in October, warned the world would have to cut greenhouse gas emissions by about 45% by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5C and potentially avoid some of the worst effects of climate change, including a dramatically increased risk of drought, flood, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. The UN climate conference commissioned the IPCC report, but when that body went to \u201cwelcome\u201d the report\u2019s findings and commit to continuing its work, four nations \u2013 the US, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia, all major oil and gas producers \u2013 refused to accept the wording, insisting instead that the convention simply \u201cnote\u201d the findings. Negotiators spent two and a half hours trying to hammer out a compromise without success. The apparently minor semantic debate has significant consequences, and the deadlock ensures the debate will spill into the second critical week of negotiations, with key government ministers set to arrive in Katowice. Most of the world\u2019s countries spoke out in fierce opposition to the oil allies\u2019 position. The push to adopt the wording \u201cwelcome\u201d was led by the Maldives, leader of the alliance of small island states, of which Australia\u2019s Pacific island neighbours are members. They were backed by a broad swathe of support, including from the EU, the bloc of 47 least developed countries, the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean, African, American and European nations, and Pacific countries such as the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu. Australia did not speak during the at-times heated debate, a silence noted by many countries on the floor of the conference, Dr Bill Hare, the managing director of Climate Analytics and a lead author on previous IPCC reports, told Guardian Australia. \u201cAustralia\u2019s silence in the face of this attack yesterday shocked many countries and is widely seen as de facto support for the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait\u2019s refusal to welcome the IPCC report,\u201d Hare said. Richie Merzian, climate and energy program director at the Australia Institute, said widespread goodwill across the Katowice talks was being undermined by \u201ca handful of countries\u201d trying to disconnect the science and urgency from the implementation of the Paris agreement. \u201cIt is disappointing but not surprising that Australia kept its head down during the debate \u2026 by remaining silent and not putting a position forward, Australia has tacitly supported the US, Russia and Saudi Arabia\u2019s rejection of the latest science on climate change.\u201d Merzian said Australia\u2019s regional neighbours, including New Zealand and Pacific islands, had voiced strong support for the IPCC\u2019s report, which was a key outcome of the Paris agreement. \u201cA number of delegates privately shared their frustration that countries like Australia stood on the sidelines while Trump\u2019s, Putin\u2019s and King Salman\u2019s representatives laid waste to the fundamental climate science.\u201d Hare said the interests of the fossil fuel industry were seeking to thwart the conference\u2019s drive towards larger emissions cuts. \u201cThe fossil fuel interest \u2013 coal, oil and gas \u2013 campaign against the IPCC 1.5 report and science continues to play out in the climate talks, but even those countries [opposing welcoming the report] are being hit by the impacts of only one degree of warming. \u201cThe big challenge now is for the Polish presidency to set aside its obsession with coal, get out of the way and allow full acknowledgement of the IPCC 1.5C report, and its implications for increasing the ambition of all countries, in the conclusion of COP24 later this week.\u201d Australia\u2019s environment minister, Melissa Price, arrived in Katowice on Sunday, with negotiations set to resume Monday morning. \u201cThe government is committed to the Paris agreement and our emissions reduction targets,\u201d she said before leaving Australia. \u201cAustralia\u2019s participation in the Paris agreement and in COP24 is in our national interest, in the interests of the Indo-Pacific region, and the international community as a whole.\u201d Price said a priority for Australia at COP24 was to ensure a robust framework of rules to govern the reporting of Paris agreement targets. \u201cAustralia\u2019s emissions reporting is of an exceptionally high standard and we are advocating for rules that bring other countries up to the standard to which we adhere.\u201d The latest Australian government figures, released last month, show the country\u2019s carbon emissions continue to rise, at a rate significantly higher than recent years. Australia\u2019s emissions, seasonally adjusted, increased 1.3% over the past quarter. Excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (for which the calculations are controversial), they are at a record high."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
