Should I wait to get a mortgage?", "bodyText": "Q I have the opportunity to buy a share of a flat through the One Housing Group shared ownership scheme. The scheme is ideal as I've found myself in the position of never being able to save a big enough deposit to buy in London. I have usually worked freelance but for the past three years have been fully employed on PAYE on a salary of \u00a352,000, as well as maintaining some freelance work on top of this. However, I have a default on my credit report from a particularly fallow period in my freelance career. The default was for a Barclaycard and was for \u00a34,500, which has been completely repaid. The default will be removed from my report in October 2010. I have been turned down for one mortgage by Barclays. I was hoping that because it is my personal bank and I have been in the black for the past three years, as well as taking out a business loan of \u00a38,000 three years ago for which I have met all my payments without difficulty, that this would be taken into account. I realise now that this was a little unrealistic given the current economic situation. My mortgage broker has found me a mortgage with the Cheshire Mortgage Corporation, which specialises in mortgages for people with past financial difficulties. The deal is considerably more expensive than others I have looked at. It is a standard variable rate at 12.75% with a discount of 2% for the first 12 months. Early repayment charges are \u00a37,673.64 for the first three years, gradually going down to \u00a31,217.33 after eight years. Is there any chance of finding a better mortgage deal than Cheshire for someone in my circumstances wishing to buy through the shared ownership scheme? My mortgage broker is not very hopeful. This seems a very high price to pay to get on the property ladder and I am beginning to think I would be better off waiting until October 2010 when my credit rating should be higher, which will also enable me to save more towards my deposit. Could you offer me any advice? AP A I'm sorry to say I think your mortgage broker is right to not be too hopeful of finding a better deal. The Cheshire offer is probably the best you can expect given your circumstances. Given the high interest rate and the steep early repayment charges on the mortgage I would be very tempted to suggest you wait until October next year when your credit rating should improve. Rather than pay such a lot for a mortgage it would seem to make sense to put your money towards saving for a deposit instead. This would also mean you are likely to have access to better a mortgage, as the best deals are typically offered to people who have at least 25% to put down as a deposit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
