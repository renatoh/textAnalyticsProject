Not that it matters: in 22 years at the club Ferguson has won everything from the Premier League to the Champions League and, of course, the 2006 Amsterdam Tournament. How his team plays Rarely starts with an orthodox centre-forward, possibly because his only orthodox centre-forward is Louis Saha. Instead plays what is effectively a 4-6-0 formation with two deep-lying midfielders and Carlos T\u00e9vez, Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Park Ji-Sung shifting position and confusing the bejesus out of the opposition. When they cut to him he'll be Chewing a piece of Airwaves gum into 568 pieces while levelling a glare at any passing BBC reporters. Married to Cathy, his wife of over 40 years, who is rumoured to have stopped him retiring: \"When he's under your feet, it's a nuisance,\" she once said. \"If he's here too long, he gets in my road.\" Will say to Gabriel Clarke Doesn't matter: he could bang on for days and never surpass 1999's short, sharp shock of: \"Football, bloody hell.\" Best day as manager Tight contest between That Magical Night In Barcelona\u2122 and the day he offloaded Eric Djemba-Djemba to Aston Villa. Worst day as manager Tight contest between the day in December 1989 when fans unfurled a \"Ta Ra Fergie\" banner after a home defeat by Crystal Palace and the day he bought Eric Djemba-Djemba. If they win A win would push Ferguson even higher up the list of managerial greats but, more importantly, check out his oddly touching victory jig: like seeing the soft underbelly of the most fearsome teacher at school. If they lose Best case scenario involves him questioning the amount of extra-time. Worst case scenario includes a small-scale nuclear meltdown which devastates Moscow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
