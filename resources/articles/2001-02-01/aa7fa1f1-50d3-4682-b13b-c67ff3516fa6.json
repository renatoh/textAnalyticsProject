Yet when it comes to numerology the game is a torch-bearer. Certainly other sports dabble in the belief that numbers shape our destiny. The NBA star Dennis Rodman, for example, argued relentlessly for the right to have 69 on the back of his vest, presumably because of the clarity and direction associated with figures divisible by three. In cricket, meanwhile, the score 111 is considered unlucky and causes umpire David Shepherd to hop up and down in a bid to fight off its evil effects. According to ancient lore 111 is a Nelson, because the hero of Trafalgar had one eye, one arm and one leg. Study of pictures of the admiral, however, tends to support the opinion that he was actually fully equipped when it came to lower limbs. The ill-favoured number then should clearly be 112. It is an error that has undoubtedly cost England hundreds of Test match victories. But while cricket and basketball may hold sincere views on the mystical power of numbers they are clearly not as enmeshed in numerological wisdom as football folk. Which is why last week (and this week and no doubt for several months to come) we were assailed on all sides by fans, players and pundits eager to alert us to the paranormal effects that A Year That Ends In One has in N17, London. There are two things that everybody knows about Tottenham Hotspur. The first is that at White Hart Lane the punters love elegant, attacking football. While this fondness for entertainment is in many ways admirable, I can't help thinking it betrays a lack of originality. I mean, is there a set of supporters in the world that don't like elegant, attractive football? In the 60s, for example, Internazionale achieved unprecedented domestic and European success under Helenio Herrera, high priest of catenaccio . But does every high-scoring game at the San Siro these days provoke the Milanese equivalent of Richard Littlejohn to bellow, \"In case you haven't noticed, Mr Tardelli, Inter fans are connoisseurs of brutally uncompromising negative football - 4-3 versus Perugia! It's just not the nerazzurri way. And it never will be\"? Somehow I doubt it. The second thing everybody knows about Spurs is that they always fancy their chances of winning something in A Year That Ends In One. This is obviously more imaginative. It's no myth either, for the facts bear it out. Tottenham have claimed eight major trophies in years ending with a single. It is easy to knock these things, of course, for as the wise old man remarked, \"It takes 27 facial muscles to smile, but only two fingers to register contempt.\" And no doubt some readers will be snorting and muttering, \"So what? On the basis of the past decade Manchester United might expect to win something whenever the year ends in a number.\" I am not so sceptical. My only complaint is that A Year That Ends In One is too much in the limelight. Personally I would like to see some other amazing facts given a regular airing. Perhaps we might be told more often that Huddersfield Town are at their most potent when the decade begins with a two, that if the Queen outlives the Duke of Edinburgh it could bring Cup glory back to Ewood Park, Rovers generally being at their swashbuckling best when an elderly widow sits on the throne, or that a top-four league finish by Middlesbrough usually heralds a world war. And then there is Sunderland's mysterious record in the Cup. They won it in 1937 and 1973. Which means that since the demise of 1873's victors, The Wanderers, the Wearsiders reign supreme in the competition in years when the last two digits multiplied together make 21. Based on this stunning piece of knowledge I expect that the club will soon take a leaf out of Man United's book and reserve their hotel rooms in London 36 years in advance. People might also like to ponder the following worrying juxtaposition. In September 1901 President William McKinley is assassinated. The following spring Manchester City are relegated from Division One. In April 1963 Manchester City go down from top flight. Seven months later John F Kennedy is shot. It is possible to read too much into these things, of course, but in my view Joe Royle would be well advised to start campaigning for tighter gun controls in the US, while George Bush should divert some overseas aid in the direction of Maine Road. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
