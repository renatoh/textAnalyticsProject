Credibility and being cool is everything \u2013 but if you\u2019re a rock-star parent, those things count for nothing when it\u2019s time to go home. Then you might sing silly songs to your kids in between chores, or when you\u2019re dropping them off at school, before it\u2019s time to put on the mask again and going back on tour. Regurgitator have never worked hard at being serious, and have recorded an entire album of the songs they sang to their kids. The result is Regurgitator\u2019s Pogogo Show: The Really Really Really Really Boring Album, with Ben Ely\u2019s 14-year-old daughter Dee Dee doing backing vocals and telling stories in between songs. The result is anything but boring, and sounds, well, like a Regurgitator album. For kids. That is, without the swearing, but with lots of farting. The classic Brisbane three-piece (Quan Yeomans, Ben Ely and Peter Kostic) are spread out these days, with Yeomans in Melbourne and Kostic in Sydney. But all have children, and so too do most of the band\u2019s Generation X fans, who\u2019d come to the gigs on a night off (or on a date night). The Pogogo Show could catch on \u2013 especially since it\u2019s already branching out into live shows. But, as Ely says in the backyard of his Brisbane home, this was no calculated Cockroaches-to-Wiggles type transformation. As much as it is a reflection of parenthood, it\u2019s also an extension of his near 30-year friendship with Yeomans. \u201cYou know that mate who you\u2019re kind of a bit sillier with than other people?\u201d he says. \u201cQuan and I have this very juvenile relationship. When we get together we try and make each other laugh, and a lot of those Regurgitator songs come from that place. Making a record, we\u2019d always find ourselves pulling back from being complete idiots, but doing a kid\u2019s album, this is the project where it really feels true to our nature. We can just jump off that idiot cliff.\u201d Dee Dee \u2013 who was, naturally, named after the late Ramones bass player \u2013 took it more seriously. \u201cWe kind of wrote it together,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of it was from childhood. And it was interesting, but it also taught me to be confident in being able to express myself through multiple mediums, and producing a record was just an easy way of getting some of these ideas out there.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t fun. Mr Butt, for example, was one of those songs that came from a school run years ago. \u201cWe were driving and we saw a cyclist and his pants were not where they should be,\u201d Dee Dee says. \u201cYou could see a lot of crack, and Dad just started tapping on the steering wheel as he usually does and pointing\u2026\u201d \u201cAnd I said, pull your pants up Mr Butt!\u201d Ely finishes. \u201cAnd then we invented this character called Mr Butt, whose pants keep falling down.\u201d Later, Ely made a papier-mache Mr Butt for the children\u2019s shows. \u201cI thought it would take a couple of hours, and it took about a week. But creatively it\u2019s kind of fun. I guess what\u2019s always appealed to us about being in a band is it\u2019s not just guys in a room playing music; there\u2019s so many other components.\u201d The album was recorded with children\u2019s guitars and drums, tracked in a single afternoon in a Melbourne studio, and mixed the next day. Immediacy was everything. \u201cKids don\u2019t think about things, they just act,\u201d Ely says, possibly referring to himself. \u201cThey don\u2019t think, \u2018I\u2019m going to draw a fire truck\u2019, they just draw a fire truck. There\u2019s not very many premeditated ideas.\u201d \u201cAnd with a target audience of kids you can make it a bit more creative,\u201d Dee Dee says. \u201cYou can also have fun with it, you don\u2019t have to stick to a certain persona or visual effect.\u201d What about bringing The Pogogo Show to the small screen? Dee Dee is way ahead of Dad here. \u201cI think with modern technology you\u2019ll want to move it to multiple platforms to really take off, because not everyone\u2019s going to be on ABC,\u201d she tells him. \u201cIf you want to put it on YouTube, all that stuff, widen your horizons \u2013 like, I can help you!\u201d After all, why wouldn\u2019t they want to take songs like Farting Is A Part of Life to suburban homes around Australia? As Dee Dee says to Ben, \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019ve got a reputation to uphold or anything.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reputation to lose,\u201d he agrees. \u2022 The Regurgitator Pogogo Show\u2019s Really Really Really Boring Album is out now"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
