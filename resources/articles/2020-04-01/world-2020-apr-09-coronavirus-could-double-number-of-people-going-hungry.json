Unilever, Nestl\u00e9 and PepsiCo, along with farmers\u2019 organisations, the UN Foundation, academics, and civil society groups, have written to world leaders, calling on them to keep borders open to trade in order to help society\u2019s most vulnerable, and to invest in environmentally sustainable food production. They urge governments to \u201ctake urgent coordinated action to prevent the Covid-19 pandemic turning into a global food and humanitarian crisis\u201d. Maintaining open trade will be key, as will investing in food supply chains and protecting farmers in the developed and developing world, they say. The G20 is coming under increasing pressure to act: a group of Nobel prize-winning economists and former senior development bank officials wrote to the forum advising that trillions of dollars would be needed to help the developing world cope with the Covid-19 pandemic. This week more than 100 former heads of government, including Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Nicolas Sarkozy, also called on the G20 to act urgently or risk recurrent outbreaks. However, little coordinated action has been agreed. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation is increasingly worried that, although harvests are good and enough food is being produced to feed the world, export restrictions or tariffs by some governments could create shortages. The urgent warning from food industry leaders comes as some countries have begin to restrict certain foods. Curbs on the movement of people, because of lockdowns, also threatens to create shortages of farm labour at a crucial time of year for many crops. \u201cThe risk of major interruptions to food supplies over the coming months is growing, especially for low-income net-food-importing countries, many of which are in sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d the food industry leaders warn in their letter. Ports and borders must be kept open to the food trade, they urge, and big food exporting nations \u201cmust make it clear that they will continue to fully supply international markets and customers\u201d. The business leaders also want investment in local food production, treating farmers, people working in food processing and all parts of the food supply chain as key workers. Small farmers may need access to credit to keep producing, and the letter calls on banks and major companies to help them. As people lose their jobs, or their income falls because of the lockdowns or ill health, hunger is likely to increase. \u201cIt would not be hard to envisage scenarios in which the number of people suffering from hunger on a daily basis, already estimated at over 800 million, doubles over the coming months, with a huge risk of increased malnutrition and child stunting,\u201d the food companies warn. Targeted food aid programmes, from the government, private sector and charities, will be needed, as well as income safety nets, the letter says. Cash assistance should be directed urgently to the developing world, and this must go far beyond the debt relief some countries have suggested. Food distribution would also be key, Wanjira Mathai, director for Africa at the World Resources Institute, said. \u201cWe must ensure that supply and distribution chains can guarantee the delivery of food to the most vulnerable of our populations, especially in densely populated urban settlements, while at the same time containing Covid-19,\u201d she said. \u201cA vital part of this includes investing in and supporting the last mile of distribution, so that food can reach people\u2019s homes and not get stuck in central food stores.\u201d As governments prepare to help their economies recover from the coronavirus crisis, they should invest in making the food system more environmentally and socially sustainable, the letter says. That will require new investment and the reform of existing subsidies, nurturing agricultural land to keep it fertile, and a focus on nutritious and affordable food production, as well as ways to cut down on food waste. \u201cToday\u2019s food system is fragile, due to chronic under-investment, the over-depletion of natural resources, and the partial misallocation of over $700bn (564bn) of annual support measures,\u201d the signatories warn. \u201cThere is no short-term fix to these challenges, but we can seize the opportunity to recover in a better and stronger way.\u201d They advocate developing regional food supply networks, and providing free healthcare and income support, as well as investment in new technologies. Rich countries should help the poor to achieve this. \u201cGetting the food system right is central to a resilient recovery across the world, creating the potential for millions of new jobs, less hunger, greater food security and better management of key natural resources: soil, water, forests and the oceans,\u201d the letter concludes. The companies behind the letter are also taking their own action on the Covid-19 crisis. Nestl\u00e9 is working with the Red Cross, giving food, medical nutrition products and bottled water for humanitarian relief, donating 10m Swiss francs (\u00a38.2m) for the countries most in need. PepsiCo has donated $45m to developed and developing countries, and is supplying 50m meals to food banks, while Unilever is donating $100m of its products and extending $500m in credit to its small-scale producers. The letter is being sent to the leaders of the G7 and the G20, and to other countries."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
