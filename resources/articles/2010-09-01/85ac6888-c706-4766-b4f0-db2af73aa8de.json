Benefits mentioned included non-segregated games even with crowds of 80,000, low-level security and not a Ferrari or player's agent in sight. Another positive element in the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), which should put the UK's soccer fraternity to shame, is the ability of openly gay players to excel. I refer specifically to Donal \u00d3g Cusack, the Cork hurling goalkeeper who became the first elite Irish sportsperson to come out as gay and continue to play top-flight hurling. His sporting career does not seem to have been damaged as a result of his decision to come out. I would dearly love to see the day when gay soccer players no longer feel that they have to hide their sexuality because of the repercussions they may suffer within the sport as well as from sponsors, the media and the public. Yes, the GAA has come a long way since its foundation in 1884, but in the coming years the commercialisation of sport will inevitably have its way, and Gaelic games will go the way of rugby, football, etc. I favour the halfway house of giving players a decent wage, but that argument is for another day. In the meantime, congratulations to Cork, the all-Ireland football champions, and to their gallant opposition. M\u00e1ir\u00edn Power London \u2022 Your editorial grossly misrepresents the Gaelic Players Association and its role within the GAA. Firstly, the GPA represents over 95% of the current inter-county players, not a mere \"few\" as suggested in your piece. Secondly, the GPA does not exist to \"extract more payments\" from the amateur governing body. It was formally recognised by the GAA's governing body this year and receives funding to implement a wide-ranging player welfare programme to assist amateur players with their careers off the field in the areas of education, career support, and health and wellbeing. The GAA's income is made up of money generated on the back of inter-county players through gate receipts, broadcasting rights and sponsorship deals \u2013 worth over \u20ac70m to the GAA annually. The GPA, formed over 10 years ago by players themselves in response to the absence of any decent player welfare support, has never sought to create a professional wage structure and has always endorsed the amateur status of Gaelic games. But these amateur players are not immune from the economic difficulties which many Irish citizens are experiencing currently, with unemployment a serious problem for them too. The GAA is happy to fund the players' association in its quest to support Gaelic footballers and hurlers off the field. It was wonderful that the Guardian chose to editorialise about the greatest occasion in the Irish sporting calendar. It is unfortunate and surprising that the piece turned out to be ill-informed and misleading. Se\u00e1n Potts Head of communications, GPA \u2022 Quilting small town-lands throughout the country, and embracing honourable, though robust, competitiveness, lies at the beating heart of these Irish national games. Authentic voluntary graft and grind is the binding, bonding core essence of this shared enterprise. This \"meithealism\" spirit is at risk of being lost to many so-called progressive societies, including Ireland. Rooting enterprise and endeavour in the regional, fed by a vibrant local voluntarism, can make serious inroads to community dysfunction, with many an equality dividend and feelgood renewal payback. All for no money. Jim Cosgrove Lismore, Co Waterford \u2022 No British game that I am aware of can compare with Gaelic football or hurling for skill, sportsmanship and sheer excitement. Further, these are games not merely played throughout rural and urban Ireland on a strictly amateur basis, they are owned, run and managed by the people of the villages, towns and cities of all the country's 32 counties. Perhaps genuine sporting organisations in the UK might care to come and see how it's done.
