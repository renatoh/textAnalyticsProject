Unfancied, underestimated, they recovered from narrow defeat to France in their opening game to ride a wave of 2-1 victories to the 2015 World Cup semi-finals, where they would take on the reigning champions, Japan. Back in England, interest had blossomed: all their games except the second, against Mexico, were watched by more than two million people. In Canada, the squad spoke of being inundated with messages of support. \u201cAt the start of the tournament people were used to English football failures in major tournaments,\u201d said the right-back Lucy Bronze. \u201cWe were always being lumped in with the men. It was just a case of here we go again whenever we went into one. We wanted to change that. We didn\u2019t want to be another English football team that let the nation down. We wanted to do the nation proud and I think that\u2019s why people are jumping in now, because we have made the country proud.\u201d They were not finished yet. England went a goal down in the 33rd minute against Japan but swiftly equalised, both those strikes coming from the penalty spot (both decisions were questionable, with the tumble by the England captain, Steph Houghton, that led to the equaliser apparently completely unprovoked). England proceeded to push for victory and an unlikely place in the final. Japan controlled possession, as that team almost always did, but it was the English who made the chances, taking 15 shots to their opponents\u2019 seven. \u201cIt won\u2019t be about which team has the most possession or who dictates the play,\u201d the England manager Mark Sampson said before the game, \u201cit will be about whoever creates and takes the chances. Seize the moment \u2013 that\u2019s going to be the story of the game.\u201d In these crucial moments, England did not seize theirs. Toni Duggan hit the bar; Ellen White forced a fine save; Jill Scott headed wide from a corner. The goal would not come, and the game seemed destined for extra time. And then, in the second minute of stoppage time, Nahomi Kawasumi broke down the right wing. To her left, two teammates sprinted towards the area. She looked up, she took her time, and then she curled in a low cross. \u201cMy intention was just to get a touch on the ball,\u201d Laura Bassett said. With Yuki Ogimi behind her and poised for a shot on goal, it would have been too dangerous just to let it go. So she stretched out her right leg, and managed to get her toe to it. It could have gone anywhere. It could have looped over the bar, or skewed either side of the post. It could have floated harmlessly to Karen Bardsley in the England goal, or run across the six-yard box to safety. But Bassett connected with the ball in such a way that it looped over Bardsley, clipped the bar and bounced down. \u201cWatching it hit the crossbar, there was a point when Steph cleared it that I thought maybe it hadn\u2019t gone in,\u201d Bassett said. This was when the referee\u2019s watch came to life and England\u2019s World Cup was dealt a killer blow. It had crossed the line. There could hardly be a more cruel conclusion to such a crucial match. Moments later the final whistle blew and the tears flowed. \u201cAfter the game I was heartbroken, devastated, just uncontrollable,\u201d Bassett said. \u201cSomething took over and I was out of control. I wanted to get out of there. I wanted to cry and be on my own and bury my head. It was so, so cruel.\u201d Bassett, still crying, was led off the pitch by her teammates. \u201cWe\u2019re all looking after Laura, letting her know it wasn\u2019t her fault,\u201d Karen Carney said. \u201cWe\u2019re there for her; we\u2019re a team through all the highs and lows. We\u2019re 100% going to give her all the love and support she needs.\u201d \u201cLook, Laura Bassett\u2019s name is on that scoresheet, but she\u2019s epitomised this England team this tournament,\u201d Sampson said. \u201cShe\u2019s been courageous, strong, kept this group together. She didn\u2019t deserve that, but she should be looked upon as a hero, an absolute hero. That\u2019s who people will remember \u2014 the Laura Bassett who headed and blocked and tackled and kept this team together.\u201d She still had work to do. Somehow, this heartbroken England side had to regroup for one final challenge. Germany might also have been struggling to come to terms with semi-final defeat, but theirs was a team of impeccable pedigree. England had never reached the last four of a World Cup; Germany had two titles, one second place and two semi-final defeats to their name. Since reunification they had played eight European Championships and won seven, while England had reached one semi-final (in 1995, when they lost 6-2 to Germany) and one final (in 2009, when they lost 6-2 to Germany again). Frankfurt had just become the eighth German team to win the Champions League in 11 years. England had played Germany 20 times, lost 18 and never won. Germany\u2019s coach, Silvia Neid, was a walking, talking repository of her country\u2019s glorious past in women\u2019s football. In 1982 she had been an 18-year-old substitute in their first ever international fixture, No 1 in her collection of 111 caps, and on retirement she moved into coaching. Until 2019 they had never played a World Cup game without Neid being involved at some level. Sampson, whose own finest achievement had been leading Bristol Academy to second place in the 2013 WSL, called her \u201cthe greatest coach in the history of the women\u2019s game\u201d. England\u2019s task, in short, was at least as hard as the one they faced in the semi-final. And unlike the men\u2019s team whose push for glory in the 1990 World Cup had ended with Paul Gascoigne\u2019s tears and defeat to Italy in the third-place play-off, it was one they rose to. With Bassett in the heart of their defence again, they won 1-0 through Fara Williams\u2019 extra-time penalty. \u201cWe knew all the facts going into the game,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAll those things drove us on to give one more big performance, because we didn\u2019t want to come away from the World Cup on the back of a defeat.\u201d They returned with bronze medals and were met at Heathrow by flag-waving crowds, just some of those who had been absorbed and inspired by their progress through the tournament. \u201cIt does still hurt,\u201d Bassett said last year. \u201cGood and bad memories are always going to pop into your head. I just find peace with those situations \u2013 I fully own it, I\u2019m responsible for it, but you get perspective and it\u2019s a part of our history. We have to be proud of where we\u2019ve come from and what we\u2019ve done. Some things happen for a reason. I certainly haven\u2019t let that moment define me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
