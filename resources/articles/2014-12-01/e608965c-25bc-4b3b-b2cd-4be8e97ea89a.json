Manchester City\u2019s game in Rome on Wednesday passed without bloodshed. Their supporters, if they knew the history of the place, kept their wits about them crossing Ponte Pietro Nenni, and the carabinieri, in full riot gear, gave the impression they were not the types to approach for directions. Yet the sense of danger was certainly less pronounced than the occasion, almost eight years ago, when more than 70 supporters of Manchester United learned the hard way what it can be like. Eighteen had been set upon outside by ultras, 10 of those suffered from stab wounds, and another 50-plus had to be bandaged up and repaired after unforgivable moments when the police embarked on what has been described as an \u201cunprovoked military-style attack\u201d. Their batons hit pretty much everything that moved and, leaving the stadium after a more serene occasion on Wednesday, a few of us journalists found ourselves reminiscing about that revealing little scene once the place had cleared back in April 2007. The carabinieri that night were having their debrief in the same part of the bus park and we could see them embracing and high-fiving. One guy, sweaty and breathless, with his helmet tucked under his arm, was swishing his baton through the air, re-enacting his best shots. His colleagues were laughing and clapping \u2013 celebrating, it seemed. Their attacks were so indiscriminate and savagely over the top that the Independent Manchester United Supporters\u2019 Association (Imusa) has been pursuing legal action against Italy\u2019s paramilitary police. The case, using television and amateur footage, states that many of those hitting out had covered their faces and removed identification badges. Supporters with nowhere to escape to can be seen in a blind state of panic. One guy, in his 50s, is curled up in the foetal position, pleading for mercy under a flurry of baton strikes. Other images show riot sticks apparently being used the wrong way round, heavy handle first, in a way that seems premeditated to cause maximum damage. In the most shocking footage a woman in her early-20s is filming with her camera until a policeman snatches it and his colleagues wade in. Three hit her in the face. A fourth strikes her with his truncheon. She disappears and the legal documents filed by Imusa state that is her being flung down a stairwell. Whatever your club allegiances, they are scenes that should appal any fan, especially those who follow their team abroad and understand the risks that accompany going to certain countries. Yet it is not just Rome\u2019s police who should be ashamed. United promised at the time they would do everything to help the fans who suffered the worst of the carabinieri\u2019s \u201cserious over\u2011reaction\u201d. They put out a statement of condemnation and said they would be happy to forward fan accounts to the Home Office. And since then? \u201cImusa has had no assistance at all from Manchester United and they have not offered to help the affected fans,\u201d according to Colin Hendrie, its vice-chairman. \u201cIndeed, they have met us only once in the nine years since the Glazer takeover.\u201d United are well aware of Imusa\u2019s work; they have just chosen to look the other way. The reason is simple. When the Glazer family set about buying the club in 2005, the chief executive then, David Gill, did everything he could to block the takeover, describing it as \u201cunworkable\u201d, as well as that now infamous quote that \u201cdebt is the road to ruin\u201d. Then it became obvious that the Glazers had the financial clout to get their way and Gill made a hasty retreat, welcoming them with open arms, gushing about how excited he was to work with such interesting people \u2013 and Long Live America! Imusa, dismayed by his volte-face, continued to argue the deal would eventually explode in United\u2019s face. Gill broke off contact, turfed the group off the club\u2019s fan forum and announced United would not deal with it again. Imusa has tried several times to reopen lines of communication, pointing out it was a single disagreement when there are numerous other issues that would benefit from the club working with its most prominent supporters\u2019 organisation. Gill\u2019s response, it says, has been \u201crobust and two-fingered\u201d. Richard Caborn, in his time as sports minister, wrote to United about it. The response, every time, has been the corporate equivalent, to borrow a local phrase, of \u201cdo one\u201d. Shame on Gill, still a United director and currently climbing his way to the top of the football ladder as Britain\u2019s candidate for a Fifa vice-presidency. \u201cIf Manchester United had worked with Imusa, there is no doubt this matter would have been dealt with swiftly by the Italian courts,\u201d Hendrie tells me. \u201cThis was an opportunity for Manchester United to work with Imusa in helping fans who had been attacked. As it is, the club stood to one side.\u201d Ed Woodward, Gill\u2019s successor, is far more approachable and fan-aware and, it must be hoped, might be more open to doing the right thing \u2013 unless, that, is, the order has come down from the Glazers themselves. Thankfully there are people who want to help. Michele Vaira, an English-speaking lawyer based in Rome, has worked tirelessly to prevent the civil action being lost to the system. But IMUSA has stretched its budget as far as it can and, frustrated by \u201cunnecessary and deliberate\u201d delays, is now lobbying MPs to put pressure on the Italians at an ambassadorial level (precisely the sort of thing a club with United\u2019s power and contacts might have been able to influence). It is clear as well that many Italians support the legal action and have been appalled to see their police indiscriminately beating foreign visitors. There is a long-running show on Italia 1 called Le lene and, a while back, three of its regulars, Trio Medusa, collared the Rome city official with responsibility for policing the stadium and took him through some hypothetical questions about what would happen if a female tourist was repeatedly struck in the face and the attackers took her camera. The official replied it was unthinkable it could happen in Rome. So they showed him the relevant footage and suggested that, as this could not possibly happen in Rome, perhaps he ought to replace the camera. The official said nothing. The players of Roma did, however, and Trio Medusa went to Old Trafford to hand the woman a new camera loaded with goodwill messages, including Francesco Totti asking her not to be put off from visiting Rome again. \u201cWe would like to apologise for the treatment you received and we hope it has not damaged the opinion you and your fellow supporters have of our city,\u201d Totti tells her. \u201cWe would also like to invite you back to the Olympic stadium and treat you as our special guest.\u201d It was a lovely touch but it was not really Totti who should be apologising. The spark that night came from Roma fans repeatedly throwing bottles from Curva Nord. A couple were thrown back and the police stormed in \u2013 at the away end only. What happened next led to questions all the way to the top of the country, with the former Italian prime minister Giuliano Amato stating: \u201cWithout doubt some policemen went too hard and used their batons too easily on fans who were on the floor.\u201d On Wednesday it was very different and much more relaxed, so maybe there has been a change in the policing. But there has never been an apology and the Sistine Chapel could have been repainted several times over in the time it has taken for the Italian legal system to hear this case. United, meanwhile, point out that they did contact the Home Office and they believe this has indirectly led to the stadium being a safer place. The club then \u201ctook the view we had done all we could\u201d. As for the woman who went to see her football team in the Eternal City and took a beating from the local police, she is Carly Lyes from Rusholme (though not a ruffian, if you know the old Smiths song) and, when United did eventually get in contact, it was not in the circumstances you might imagine. In 2010, during protests about the club\u2019s ownership, she lifted one of those banners that were popular at the time, saying \u201cLove United, Hate Glazer\u201d. She was thrown out and the club allege she was \u201cdisorderly\u201d. Carly has been banned from Old Trafford for life. Sterling shows Liverpool lack of respect with timing Early in October, Jamie Carragher reacted to a round of back-page stories about Raheem Sterling considering his Liverpool future, with Real Madrid apparently hovering, by calling into question the player\u2019s timing, bearing in mind this little game of financial cat-and-mouse through the media followed a last-minute equaliser for Everton in the Merseyside derby and a demoralising defeat to Basel in the Champions League. \u201cIf anyone around me had put out a story like that about me during my career, never mind the day before a game, our relationship would have been over,\u201d the former Liverpool captain said. \u201cMy agent certainly wouldn\u2019t have done anything like that and I would never have allowed that, even if he had wanted to.\u201d Fast-forward two months and the leak \u2013 and this all feels suspiciously like a strategy \u2013 that Sterling and his camp regard Liverpool\u2019s latest offer as \u201cnowhere near acceptable\u201d. The previous day, Liverpool had been knocked out of the Champions League. On Sunday they play Manchester United, the old enemy. Yet again, the timing of this operation stinks. Tradition no match again for TV demands Friday night football is coming to the Premier League in 2016 and, for those of us who quite like that strange concept known as Saturday 3pm kick\u2011offs, it is tempting sometimes to wonder if anyone ever stands up in these planning meetings, takes a deep breath and mentions it is not what the old-fashioned people who pay to go to games really want. The same thought occurs when AFC Wimbledon against Liverpool, the pick of the FA Cup third-round ties, is switched to a Monday night or, in the case of Everton against West Ham, one of the most eagerly awaited weekends in the calendar means being shunted to a Tuesday night. We all know football is changing. It\u2019s unshakeable, and we are obliged to live with it in this era when television rules. Yet it would be nice to think it doesn\u2019t always have to be the matchgoers who lose out for their armchair equivalents."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
