That was obvious in the way the teams approached their task yesterday, with nothing more than pride at stake. Derbyshire, who finished bottom of the pile last year and were widely tipped for a repeat, moved increasingly breezily to 391 in their second innings, with four of their number reaching half-centuries. Worcestershire grew ever more ragged as their last afternoon in the field dragged on, their performance best summed up in the 107th over as Matt Mason misfielded on the boundary to gift Nathan Dumelow his 50, then Gareth Batty, the bowler, hurled the next ball for four overthrows. There were also some mystifying bowling changes by the acting captain, Vikram Solanki, prompting the surprising conclusion that they were missing the inspirational presence of Graeme Hick - who spent the day in the pavilion nursing his broken thumb. Andrew Gait, Derbyshire's opener, grafted to his second half-century in this match, but it was Steve Selwood, a left-hander from Loughborough University, who played the most pleasing innings of the day, sharing a fifth wicket stand of 131 with Jason Kerr who made 68. Graeme Welch then lofted Alamgir Sheriyar over the hospitality boxes onto New Road before Dumelow helped himself to 56 at almost a run a ball. Worcestershire are left to make an unlikely 373 but they have already lost Anurag Singh and gave the impression that their season had ended two days early. They were not the only ones - there was even a cake sale in the Ladies Pavilion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
