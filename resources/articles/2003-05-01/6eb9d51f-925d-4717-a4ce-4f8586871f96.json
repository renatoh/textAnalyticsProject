The lowest one-day score in the county's history - 54 in only 20.2 overs - will have pricked inflated expectations. Essex lacked Nasser Hussain, Andy Flower and Ronnie Irani but it mattered not a jot as they diligently posted 211 for six and then Scott Brant, their young Zimbabwean left-armer, and his unsung new-ball partner Graham Napier shared eight gift wickets. The pitch posed a few questions - and Yorkshire, to a man, flunked the lot. The club's response is expected to be swift. After a board meeting today they are likely to confirm the signing of India's one-day batsman Yuvraj Singh because of growing worries over the knee trouble affecting their Australian batsman Matthew Elliott. Last night, they blustered unconvincingly. Some things never change. An injury scare over Darren Gough, who bowled only three overs before leaving the field, did largely subside when it was deemed to be only a minor hamstring strain. As the county seek to drag themselves out of the financial mire, there has been no shortage of brusque expressions of faith in \"Yorkshireness\" as a new regime seeks to rebuild patriotic fervour among supporters stunned by financial incompetence. It has been reflected in the sacking of Wayne Clark, the Australian who coached them to the championship in 2001 and then became the scapegoat for the relegation that followed a year later. It has also been seen in the initial decision not to sign a second overseas player. When Anthony McGrath and Kevin Sharp, captain and coach respectively, asserted that the squad was strong enough, a county saddled with an overdraft exceeding \u00a36m happily acquiesced. Circumstances have soon changed. Sharp's coaching life has taken quite a turn: Leeds and Bradford UCCE one minute, back with the county where he was once a teenage star the next. At tea he was about to chat optimistically about the sense of togetherness, but a scoreboard of 24 for seven persuaded him to save his breath. Yorkshire's batting display yesterday was horrendous. The in-form Michael Lumb fell in the first over, charging Brant, and both Michael Vaughan and Victor Craven perished to overambitious pulls. Essex assessed conditions far more intelligently. In the case of Will Jefferson, who drove powerfully off the front foot to make 57 in as many balls, they were considerably more imposing. Jefferson, at 6ft 10in, is quickening England's interest - news has reached them that his back-foot play has improved during a winter in Perth - and his punishing straight hits left Ryan Sidebottom wishing to burrow deep into his own forest of brown curls. The danger passed when Jefferson was bowled by McGrath. The stoutly built 18-year-old Tim Bresnan was also worthy of respect, but Aftab Habib's half-century, completed despite a hamstring injury, protected Essex's advantage. Yorkshire lost \u00a31.3m in 2002 - not only at Leeds United has the stereotype of northern financial rectitude been undermined - and the quartet of businessmen now in charge have gone some way to restoring sanity. The club will become a plc this year, subject to members' approval. But they cannot afford many days like this."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
