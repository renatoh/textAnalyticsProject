According to the Mirror, United are \u201cplotting an \u00a380m raid on Bayer Leverkusen for new German sensation Kai Havertz\u201d, who has become their \u201cNo 1 target\u201d, with the club happily \u201cconfident of luring the 20-year-old to Old Trafford in a bumper deal\u201d. Now might be a good time for United to make their move, given that Europe\u2019s top clubs all seem to be distracted by thoughts of Red Bull Salzburg\u2019s Erling Haaland. Marca report that Barcelona and Real Madrid have joined the race for the 19-year-old goal grabber, whose value has been estimated at somewhere between a laughably low \u20ac12m and a hilariously high \u20ac100m. Juventus, Bayern Munich and United themselves are also in the running, apparently \u2013 though just last week Bild insisted that \u201cmore than 20 clubs\u201d have targeted the Norwegian ace. United have also been linked with Burnley\u2019s Dwight McNeil, a 19-year-old who was in their own academy until, when he was 14, they decided he wasn\u2019t going to be very good. \u201cI\u2019m a Man United fan, despite what happened,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll always be a Man United fan. I just wasn\u2019t up to their standards.\u201d Fortunately he has since improved, or their standards have since slipped. One or the other. Perhaps both. Brendan Rodgers is planning to strike while the iron is hot \u2013 or while the Foxes are hot, anyway \u2013 by using his club\u2019s enviable league position to attract some top-notch talent in January. The Mirror links Leicester with a \u00a320m move for Emmanuel Dennis, Club Bruges\u2019 21-year-old Nigerian striker who has previously been linked with both Arsenal and Sheffield United. Rodgers is also keen on Real Sociedad\u2019s Diego Llorente, a 26-year-old centre-back with a \u00a345m release clause. Meanwhile at Rodgers\u2019 former club Liverpool, scouts are running the rule over yeat another Bundesliga-based youngster in the shape of Hertha Berlin\u2019s 21-year-old winger Javairo Dilrosun. Bournemouth and Wolves are preparing for a couple of important contests. The first takes place at the Vitality Stadium later this month, with three league points on the line. The second will follow in January, with both clubs planning moves for Huddersfield\u2019s 22-year-old striker Karlan Grant, whose fine form \u2013 and nine league goals so far this season \u2013 look likely to lead to his departure just a year after his \u00a32m arrival from Charlton. The Times reports that the decision to strip Granit Xhaka of the Arsenal captaincy \u201cmeans he is likely to move in January, potentially returning to Germany\u201d. And having not given him so much as a single minute of first-team football since the first game of the season \u2013 though he did get closer than ever to a Champions League debut when he spent the entirety of Wednesday\u2019s goalless draw against Slavia Prague on the bench \u2013 Barcelona are ready to let their 21-year-old midfielder Carles Alena leave in January \u2013 but only on loan, just in case he turns out to actually be good. Milan are apparently the favourites to seal a deal, though Tottenham are also in the mix."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
