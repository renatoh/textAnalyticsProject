The UN children\u2019s agency has warned in a report that the cognitive development of millions of under-fives is being undermined because parents are receiving neither the right guidance nor basic support, such as maternity leave. \u201cTime and money constraints mean that parents are forced to focus on putting food on the table, rather than play with their children, particularly in challenging circumstances where conflict, violence, extreme poverty and disease are rife,\u201d said Dr Pia Britto, chief of early childhood development at Unicef. A survey covering 64 developing countries asked parents if they had spent any time telling stories, reading, naming, counting, drawing, playing or singing songs with their child over a three-dayperiod. A quarter of children had not been engaged in any of these activities, which are crucial to promoting their cognitive, emotional and social development. Britto said the findings were likely to be indicative of a wider pattern. \u201cWe are not caring for children\u2019s brains the way we care for their bodies \u2013 especially in early childhood, when the science shows that children\u2019s brains and children\u2019s futures are rapidly being shaped,\u201d said Anthony Lake, Unicef\u2019s executive director. \u201cWe need to do more to give parents and caregivers of young children the support they need during this most critical period.\u201d While a strong body of research has shown the benefits of interaction between children and their parents, this is not always communicated to families, said Britto. \u201cSome parents may not realise the unique window of opportunity that early childhood presents, where brain growth is somewhat reliant on a child\u2019s environment and experiences.\u201d Unicef researchers also found that more than 20% of children under five are regularly left on their own with no adult supervision, according to data collected across more than 70 countries, while 80% are regularly subjected to violent discipline by their caregivers. The report identified three policies essential to supporting families with young children: two years of free pre-primary education, paid breastfeeding breaks during the first six months of a child\u2019s life, and adequate paid parental leave. In 32 countries, home to one in eight of the world\u2019s under-fives, families do not receive any of these basic entitlements, the study found. The nurturing and care given to young children is not recognised as a priority, said Britto. \u201cWhen it comes to young children, most governments are thinking around survival and keeping the children disease-free, and then they are thinking about education in the form of primary school,\u201d she said. \u201cBetween survival and school we\u2019re missing this early part of development.\u201d On average, governments worldwide spend less than 2% of their education budgets on early childhood programmes. Unicef has suggested that average spending should increase to 10%, and has urged governments to make family-friendly policies. \u201cThere needs to be an urgent investment and political prioritisation of this agenda. In countries where it has been prioritised, for example, Chile, we\u2019ve seen it is possible [to make progress],\u201d said Britto. In Chile, a holistic early years program, Chile Grows with You, has reached more than 80% of children, providing education and healthcare. Britto added that health workers should expand the services they offer to families, and \u201cbroaden the lens beyond health to include all of the different factors that together help shape and define young brains\u201d. Britto said families needed to demand services that will help them create an enriching environment for their children. \u201cYoung children who grow up in an enriching environment where they feel loved, care for, protected and stimulated, and where they received good nutrition, have the best possible chance of optimal development,\u201d said Britto."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
