It would be easy for Ben Godfrey to captivate and impress the students he talks to with his highlights from the past 18 months but he prefers to educate with the whole truth. As he puts it: \u201cI\u2019ve experienced the wind blowing against me a fair few times.\u201d For the first time since his arrival from Norwich in October, the England Under-21 defender will have Evertonians behind him \u2013 well, 2,000 at least \u2013 when Chelsea visit tomorrow. \u201cIt seems strange that this will be my first time playing in front of them,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to hear them at Goodison.\u201d Godfrey \u2018met\u2019 some fans this week when, thanks to the wonders of robot telemedicine equipment, virtual ward visits enabled Everton to maintain their pre-Christmas tradition of seeing patients at Alder Hey Children\u2019s Hospital. He has also delivered remote talks during the pandemic to students and academy players hoping to forge a career in the professional game. His is a valuable lesson for all. \u201cOne of the messages I try to get across is to have belief in yourself,\u201d says Godfrey. \u201cI would say a massive percentage of football is in your head and you\u2019ve got to keep believing and cracking on when things are going against you. But it is so hard for kids and even for their parents to see that when you are going through it. But as someone who has been through that experience it is so important that you stay strong and believe in your ability.\u201d Before the rise under Daniel Farke, the Norwich head coach, and the move to Everton for a fee that could reach \u00a325m, there was rejection. More than a fair share while growing up in York. The 22-year-old explains: \u201cFootball has not been an easy journey, particularly for my family. That\u2019s something people don\u2019t always realise. They were travelling to Middlesbrough three or four times a week when I was 13 years old, driving up straight after work, and then to be told you\u2019re not good enough and you\u2019re going to be let go was hard for me, but it was hard for them to be part of that too. After that I went on trial to Leeds, Sheffield Wednesday and Barnsley and they all told me I wasn\u2019t good enough. \u201cAt Middlesbrough they didn\u2019t see me as a player who was good enough to be offered a full-time contract in the future. At Leeds and Barnsley I was told I was no better than all the other academy players they had at the club. It was pretty much the same message at Sheffield Wednesday. I spent a long time on trial there and I remember being happy with how I was playing and training, but again it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cAs a young kid you feel like your football world is coming to an end. I can tell young kids now that it\u2019s definitely not but at the time you feel: \u2018Where am I going to make it then?\u2019 You see every other kid getting contracts and scholarships and kicking on but I just have to thank my family, friends and the people around me who did believe in me back then.\u201d The defender\u2019s fortunes improved after returning on a scholarship to York City, where he made his senior debut at 17, although he cites an earlier conversation at Leeds as the moment that changed everything. Godfrey recalls: \u201cA massive turning point for me and my family, which stays with me for ever, was when Leeds let me go after a trial. One of the coaches said: \u2018Go prove us wrong.\u2019 I remember thinking back then: \u2018You know what? I will.\u2019 Me and my family had conversations about it and in the end I went back to York and started that mission of proving those people wrong.\u201d It is put to Godfrey that having a father who played professional sport \u2013 Alex, a tutor at York College, played rugby league for York City Knights and Hull KR \u2013 must have been an invaluable help. The Everton defender creases with laughter. \u201cAll everyone talks to me about is my dad playing rugby.\u201d That explains it. \u201cWe have a joke in the family about this \u2013 my mum [Sharon] was a hairdresser but I don\u2019t cut hair. But no, he was a massive influence from a young age and probably doesn\u2019t get the credit he deserves. He knows the ups and downs of sport and what it takes to make the cut and achieve your goals. He always believed in me and picked me up when I was in broken pieces. As did my mum. I will be forever thankful to both of them for that.\u201d Godfrey\u2019s guiding influence is now the three-times Champions League-winning coach Ancelotti. It has been a challenging start for the defender in a team that have not kept a Premier League clean sheet since the opening game, and given his assignments so far. In five appearances, beginning as a substitute in the draw against Liverpool, Godfrey has played at right-back, left-back and in a three-man central defence. There are no complaints. \u201cI loved every second of it,\u201d he says of his debut against Sadio Man\u00e9. \u201cI\u2019ve watched many Merseyside derbies with my family on TV, it is one of the biggest derbies in the world, so to be involved in it as a new player was massive. It was a day I\u2019ll never forget.\u201dHe adds: \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed it all. I\u2019m a young player who is willing to learn and will do anything for the team and if that means playing out of position then so be it. Every player goes through a spell where you\u2019re on the bench or out of the squad and it makes you appreciate being on the pitch at all times. It is unbelievable to be able to learn from this manager. I am so appreciative of the opportunity. He has worked with some world-class players and, the experiences he\u2019s had, I can soak everything up. And I have been doing. \u201cHe gives you confidence. He\u2019s quite laid-back and to be honest he simplifies things for you. He makes the game as easy as possible for you and I\u2019m really enjoying learning from him. Believe me, everyone here is desperate to achieve something and we are working hard to do something we can all be proud of at this football club.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
