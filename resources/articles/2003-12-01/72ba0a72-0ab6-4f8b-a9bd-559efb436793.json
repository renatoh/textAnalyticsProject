The Bath centre was lying in bed on the morning of the England squad's parade through London with the Webb Ellis Cup before dates at Buckingham Palace and No10 Downing Street when a red-top tabloid was thrust into his hands. Tindall's picture was on the front page along with that of Zara Phillips, daughter of the Princess Royal. The two were, according to the report, an item, having been spotted out on a dinner date, and the last \"single\" player in the England squad, it continued, had found himself a partner. It was not that long ago that the tabloids regarded rugby union as a rah-rah sport, played and watched by toffs and of, at best, peripheral interest to their readers. England's success has changed all that and their players have been warned that what they do in private may now be deemed by the media to be in the public's interest. \"It was a weird sensation when I read the article,\" said Tindall. \"The fact it was on the front page was more about Zara than me and there was nothing to it. We have been mates for a while and we went to a do together one evening. Someone else who was there must have phoned up the newspaper concerned and sold what was not a story. \"I rang Zara and she told me not to worry about it and that it happened to her all the time. When I was at the dinner party, making the newspapers was the last thing on my mind and the incident did make me think. Every player in the squad is going to have to develop a thick skin because there is going to be more where that came from.\" Compared with their football counterparts the England squad have been praised for being paragons of virtue. \"We were warned after winning the World Cup that we would have a high media profile and not to do anything stupid,\" said Tindall. \"But that message had been rammed home to us four years ago when Lawrence Dallaglio was set up. We know how to conduct ourselves.\" The 25-year-old Tindall is on the bench today for the jamboree against the New Zealand Barbarians at Twickenham, one of five players on duty who started the World Cup final. He appreciates the attention will gradually die down but part of him hopes it is sustained for a few years to come. \"If the other side of being front-page news is a growth in interest in the game, it is a price worth paying. Soccer is way out in front of us in terms of popular appeal but I would like to think that we could use the World Cup success to help close the gap. \"We have the opportunity to make rugby a bigger sport and we must not waste it. That means getting more and more people to watch club matches and sustaining our momentum at international level. We will not enjoy the same level of exposure that we had during the World Cup but we have to make sure that the game's profile is higher than it was before.\" Tindall was left out of the semi-final against France, having been dropped to the bench to make way for his club colleague Mike Catt with the selectors wanting a second outside-half option to help Wilkinson who, up to that point, had not played anything like the World Cup hero he was to become. Tindall returned for the final, swapping places with Catt, with the England assistant coach Andy Robinson saying that the midfield choice for Australia had been between Catt and Will Greenwood and that Tindall's place had been assured. \"Missing the semi-final was a low,\" said Tindall. \"Being told that I had not been left out because of form helped in one sense but made it more frustrating in another. You have to keep the disappointment to yourself and put on a smile to make sure that squad morale does not suffer. \"The centre positions are among the most fiercely contested in the squad. Ollie Smith and Stuart Abbott, two excellent prospects, have their chance today while Will and Mike will be around for the Six Nations and Newcastle's Jamie Noon has been in great form. Form is going to be the key, not past glory.\" Talking of form, Tindall returned home to be confronted by a sight which, in recent years, had become rare: Bath were sitting at the top of the Zurich Premiership having confirmed their status in the top flight only on the final day of last season . There would be no more relegation dog-fights to brace himself for. \"Bath made some shrewd signings during the summer, including John Connolly to oversee the coaching, and it has paid dividends,\" said Tindall. \"It means I am going to have to fight for my place because the guys who have done the business while we have been away are not going to stand meekly aside. It is what we need as a club because the last couple of seasons have been nerve-jangling.\" As the teams were lining up in the tunnel before the final, Tindall turned to his opposite number Stirling Mortlock and said: \"This is why we play rugby, right?\" Mortlock grunted his agreement. \"I was just on a high,\" said Tindall. \"I don't normally react like that but it was a special occasion. \"Life-changing? In the short-term, perhaps, but I hope it is game-changing.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
