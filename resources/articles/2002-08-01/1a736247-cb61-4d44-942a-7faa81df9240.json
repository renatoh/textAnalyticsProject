If there was any risk that the performance of England's fans at this summer's World Cup - just 13 out of 8,000 arrested and only one for a public order offence - might lead to complacency, then this will have been usefully scotched by this week's release of last season's statistics on football hooligans. Although arrests at Premiership matches fell by almost one-fifth to 1,311, the number of violent disorders at top clubs rose from 28 to 87 and the number of arrests in first and second division clubs is rising again. Police chiefs concede there are several \"problem clubs\" attracting high numbers of thugs in divisions one and two - Millwall, Stoke and Cardiff to name just three. Stoke City was the club with the largest number of fans arrested - 143 held, almost triple the number of the previous season. The importance of the new anti-hooligan powers, which police and courts now hold, could not be better shown than by the absence of England's most notorious football followers at this year's World Cup. More than 1,000 were served with banning orders, requiring them to surrender their passports. Similar exercises are being planned for the 2004 European championship in Portugal and the World Cup in Germany in 2006. But John Denham, minister responsible for the police, was right to call this week for more consistent use of legal sanctions at home. The league tables released by the Home Office this week show a wide variation in the use of banning orders. While Stoke (107 banning orders) and Cardiff (125) have been firm, Tottenham Hotspur (7 out of 105 arrests) and Sunderland (13 out of 129 arrests) have not. Much of the hooligans' disorders have moved out of the grounds, where offenders can be identified through CCTV cameras, to the surrounding residential streets. This is where the new policing policy of \"public reassurance\" should come into its own. The aim is to tackle issues disrupting the quality of life in communities by bringing together relevant local bodies. What could be worse than running fights between rival fans outside your home? The \"problem clubs\", already suffering from lost TV income, should stand by for a summons from the police to help work out ways of reducing violence on match days. There are numerous measures from banning visiting fans to requiring pubs to be more responsible by refusing to serve drunk fans."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
