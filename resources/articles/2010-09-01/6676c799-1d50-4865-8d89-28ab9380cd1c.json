A Martian arriving in Manchester this week could be forgiven for thinking that how to run an economy was simply about how or when or whether to cut the deficit. To him or her (or, indeed, it), we would recommend Ha-Joon Chang's latest book, 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism. Where mainstream economic debate is often stiflingly narrow, Chang talks about 19th-century Germany, 21st-century China and many other points besides. Where economics is dry, this Cambridge professor delights in paradox. And myth-busting \u2013 because what Chang does in 23 Things is take apart many of the assertions put forward by those who argue that economics is nothing more than letting markets rip. He asserts that there is no such thing as a free market (whatever Vince Cable might say) and that successful economies do not require economists. He does this with charm and a desire to see how things work in the real world. Chang's readers will recognise this style from Bad Samaritans and Kicking Away the Ladder, his earlier books on development economics. But 23 Things is an attempt at a more popular book, and it deserves both a wide audience and \u2013 with its discussion of industrial strategy and the relationship between state and markets \u2013 to be read by politicians hunting for new ideas.
