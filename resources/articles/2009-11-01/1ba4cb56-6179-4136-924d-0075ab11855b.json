Smith, who managed the Scots between 2004 and 2007, was installed as one of the favourites to do so again after Burley's dismissal on Monday. Yet the 61-year-old, who plans to remain at Rangers until the summer at least, has no inclination to make the move back into international football. \"I enjoyed my time with Scotland but it was me who made the conscious decision to leave,\" Smith explained. \"I feel as though I've had my shot at it. That's it as far as I'm concerned. It's not something I'd go back and do, not given it was my own decision to leave. \"Personally I don't think you should rule yourself out until you are actually asked and I have not been asked to go back but in fairness to everybody there has been a level of speculation surrounding my own position.\" Graeme Souness, another who has ruled out taking on the Scotland job, has said the dearth of playing talent north of the border means whoever succeeds Burley faces an impossible task. Smith, though, disagrees with that sentiment. \"I really enjoyed the job,\" he added. \"I think there is a lot of doom and gloom surrounding it at the present moment. That happens because the situation is result orientated. But if you take away the last campaign for the World Cup, and look at the previous one, I don't think Scotland could have had a harder section which we almost came through. \"I think Scotland have a decent level of player. If they get together they have an opportunity to improve and challenge again.\" Smith was unwilling to hand his backing to any one candidate, with the Dundee United manager Craig Levein now the clear favourite. \"It is a big challenge,\" Smith said. \"It's a huge job and I don't think there is any doubt about that. But I think there will always be people out there willing to accept that challenge. It's one I must admit I enjoyed.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
