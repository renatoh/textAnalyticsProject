He is rich and partially famous, there is nothing he doesn't know about dough balls or mozzarella, but can he swap his career in pizza production to become a dyed-in-the-wool public service broadcaster? Andy, Luke's partner, is also a very successful businessman - he sold a nasty reconstituted snack in a pot to the public - but now he too will be joining his friend and associate in this Christmas special double, \"Faking It\". Parachuted in as chairman and chief executive of Channel 4, Luke and Andy have less than a year to convince a panel of \"experts\" that they are in fact capable of running the show, and that they deserve some of the \u00a3300m prize money. It helps that their mentor - Stephen from Ofcom - is also on the panel of judges, but will Stephen's co-judges, Tessa and Gordon, be convinced that the pair have pulled it off - or will they see straight through their inexperience? And privatise them? While C4's previous chief executive, Mark Thompson, was demonstrating management vision in spades over at Shepherd's Bush, one observation that might be made of Luke Johnson and Andy Duncan is that they are so far struggling to find a consistent message for C4. This is curious coming from television's odd couple, who have nothing if not a bargain bucket of marketing experience between them. Given that there may be \u00a3300m of public service publisher cash up for grabs, some peculiar behaviour might have been expected. What it prompted, as previously noted in these pages, is a flurry of enthusiasm for portraying oneself as both deserving and destitute. But the business of facing in two directions at the same time must be taking a toll on the relationship between C4's two new managers and their staff. At a time when Kevin Lygo, head of programming, has begun to tweak the deck chairs to some good effect and deliver a more robust and coherent schedule, the corporate side of the business is not selling the positive story but instead extending a begging bowl with naive alacrity. One has to have enormous sympathy with C4's spin doctors, who must struggle on a daily basis to reconcile the fact that the broadcaster is looking in better shape than it has done for some time, with the Chicken Licken act put on for the benefit of the government and Ofcom. C4 argues that its revenues and share are under pressure from the expansion of digital television without acknowledging that it benefits via E4 and FilmFour from that expansion in a way no other terrestrial broadcaster has managed. It is launching further channels into digital space - Four More and a mooted documentary channel - while decrying the terribleness of a multichannel future. Unpicking the good news from the doom thus becomes about as rewarding as sorting through a dungheap for a diamond. If this were just a matter of spin rather than strategy, it could be resolved easily. Unfortunately, the confusion is indicative of a more fundamental indecision within the company. Industry gossip - always interesting, seldom reliable - is that Ofcom had its ears very much open to C4 in terms of sorting out future funding when public service publishing was just a twinkle in Stephen Carter's eye. At the time, and it was Thompson's time, C4 turned down Ofcom's kind offer of public money. But with the new Duncan regime rather fancying the promise of free cash, it is now playing a very different game, with potentially serious consequences. What happens, for instance, if the PSP project, against all the odds, goes through? C4 has clearly chosen to petition with all its might to become the PSP. But if it fails? Then we would have a situation where three out of five broadcasters in the market had some kind of quasi-public service role at a time when even the BBC is having to carry out a root and branch audit of what constitutes public service. It seems unlikely that we would have a situation where both the PSP and C4 survive. The most likely outcome would be that if the PSP is commissioned and it is not C4, then the broadcaster will be privatised - after all, it has announced that in seven years' time, without extra cash it will have no hope of carrying out a public service role to a satisfactory standard. ITV's game plan is similar but much lower risk than C4 - as it will carry on as before whatever happens to public service publishing money. But C4 is now in a difficult place. The actuality is of a terrestrial channel which is improving and has digital options, but the perception is one of negativity and struggle. Johnson and Duncan are certainly bringing new skills to the boardroom, but a few of the more traditional strategic disciplines seem to have deserted them. Let's hope it is temporary. \u00b7 emily.bell@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
