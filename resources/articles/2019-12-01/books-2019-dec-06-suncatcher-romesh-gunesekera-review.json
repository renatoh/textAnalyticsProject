His father is a dyed-in-the-wool communist, in an armchair sort of way. His mother is trying to work out what to do about her son\u2019s education now the schools have been suspended. But Kairo doesn\u2019t care too much about all this. He\u2019s just met Jay \u2013 be warned, it\u2019s never a coincidence when the glamorous, wealthy character with the gilded life is called Jay \u2013 and he\u2019s going to appear in a coming of age tale. Jay has a life that Kairo finds intoxicating. His family are rich and live in a beautiful house; he has an attractive, unstable mother and a gangsterish uncle with a farm and a classic car collection; he likes to cycle, drive, shoot, build, skinny-dip, defend the helpless and all the other things boyhood heroes do. His bedroom is filled with metaphors for the contained experience of childhood \u2013 fish tanks, in this case, which also give us a hint of Jay\u2019s possible fetish for control \u2013 but Jay and Kairo are growing up, and need a new, more apt metaphor for the half-freedom of adolescence. So they build a cage for Jay\u2019s budgies, where Jay also keeps a sutikka, a bird native to Sri Lanka that he\u2019s caught, which he calls his \u201cSunbeam\u201d. The title of Romesh Gunesekera\u2019s novel invites us to draw parallels between this bird and Jay. And if you haven\u2019t worked out how the book ends already from the character\u2019s name, you\u2019ll have a second opportunity to see the story\u2019s destination heavily foreshadowed in the fate of the bird. A series of metaphors for the dangers waiting in the adult world assail the cage Jay and Kairo build \u2013 a monitor lizard, some crows \u2013 and when the boys go away for a weekend at Jay\u2019s uncle\u2019s farm, we begin to see how these dangers can assail them in the real world. Jay\u2019s urge to control comes up again, and we\u2019re asked to question his attitude towards all these things he cages when something really gruesome happens to a local farm boy whom Jay treats as part friend, part moving target. This harrowing incident, the most successful passage in the novel, appears and disappears without particularly affecting the plot, besides providing a metaphor for the way the rich treat the poor in Sri Lanka. The book carries on to its inevitable conclusion, one family falling apart, the other not seeming so tawdry after all, a schematic romance subplot being sketched in and the cage metaphor coming up again and again. Gunesekera is an internationally acclaimed writer with a significant body of work, but his new novel is a programmatic piece of genre fiction, the coming-of-age storyline that launched a thousand films. An interesting sociopolitical setting is offered up but sketched so lightly that it doesn\u2019t feel as though the book would need to change more than a few nouns in order to move to Australia, America or anywhere, really. This is partly because Kairo is an intentionally naive narrator \u2013 there\u2019s a funny moment where he confuses \u201caviaries\u201d with \u201covaries\u201d \u2013 but elsewhere, characters\u2019 digressions on the theme of communism read like pub chat, interchangeable with any other political hot topic. The writing is sometimes clumsy \u2013 what does \u201che relied on a comfortable compromise between idealism and action which now, with socialism back in the fray, was beginning to show some strain\u201d mean? Why can\u2019t socialism accommodate both idealism and action? Should \u201caction\u201d perhaps be \u201cpragmatism\u201d? Has anyone ever really said \u201cBeauty needs appreciation, and the adoration of the young is a wonderful thing\u201d when talking about going for a drive in a car? Why has a sentence like \u201ca fishing trip involved more deliberate deaths, and this time I would be the one doing it\u201d not been sharpened up? It\u2019s not possible to \u201cdo\u2019deliberate deaths: they\u2019re not a verb. And when a Bible falls open, entirely by chance, at the most apposite possible verse (Proverbs 30:17), I despair. A writer just can\u2019t be this paint-by-numbers and invite comparisons with F Scott Fitzgerald. Glimpses of a lyrical and soulful voice flicker occasionally \u2013 Gunesekera touches universality when he writes \u201cI was convinced that we were more than what we seemed: that we were boys whose bodies were dross, whose bodies would one day be discarded\u201d. Ultimately, though, Suncatcher gives off the strangest air of not actually being a novel. It\u2019s the plot of a teen movie reheated, all detail planed away to make room for the conventions of genre. It makes one ask what stories are actually for \u2013 aren\u2019t novels called novels because they should contain something new? \u2022 Barney Norris\u2019s latest book is The Vanishing Hours (Doubleday).
