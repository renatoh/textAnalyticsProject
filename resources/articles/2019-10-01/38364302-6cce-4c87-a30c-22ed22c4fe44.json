Despite failing to become prime minister, Javid\u2019s elevation to chancellor from home secretary ensured he beat his successor at the Home Office, Priti Patel, who has risen 36 places from last year into second. The full GG2 power list will be announced on Thursday night by the Asian Media Group (AMG). Javid, the first Asian to hold one of the great offices of state, is the son of a Pakistani immigrant bus driver, like the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, whom he deposed from the top of the list last year. \u201cI\u2019m honoured to be recognised on the GG2 power list again and I am proud to live in a Britain where anyone can become chancellor, whatever their background,\u201d Javid said. \u201cEach person on this year\u2019s power list has their own story to tell, but the example they set to young Asian women and men is helping to create a better and brighter future for Britain. I commend and congratulate them all.\u201d Despite being second-generation migrants, Javid and Patel have both attracted controversy for their language around immigration. Javid was criticised for referencing the race of criminals when tweeting \u201cAsian paedophiles\u201d in reference to the conviction of a Huddersfield grooming gang, while Patel has mocked those who champion free movement. Shailesh Solanki, the executive editor of AMG, said: \u201cThey do divide opinion but we have to recognise that they are holding two of the great offices of state. The Asian community \u2013 we are not a monolithic bloc, we have different views. You cannot say that they do not represent the views of any Asian people.\u201d He said that Patel \u201cas an Asian woman will inspire another generation\u201d, expressing pride that 10 out of the top 30 this year are woman and \u2013 for the first time \u2013 two out of the top three, challenging outdated perceptions of Asian women as being in the background. \u201cWe are seeing a steady increase in the number of women on our list,\u201d said Solanki. \u201cIt\u2019s a cause for celebration to see Asian women in different sectors enriching British society.\u201d Gina Miller, born in British Guiana (now Guyana) to parents of Indian descent, completes the top three after winning a second legal challenge against the government over Brexit. Khan is down two places to fourth. This is the ninth year of the list and it features 29 new entries. The other cabinet member in the top 10 is the chief secretary to the Treasury, Rishi Sunak, up 37 places to seventh. With the country\u2019s most senior counter-terrorism officer, Neil Basu, at five, the actor Riz Ahmed at eight and the president of the Royal Society, Sir Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, at nine, Solanki said the list\u2019s composition had changed significantly over time. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely more diversity of roles and professions in the list,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a media group, we have always tried to encourage the Asian community to look beyond the traditional professions of law, medicine, business, engineering and encouraged public service.\u201d He said the other 91 places, when revealed, would further illustrate the diversity of contributions, featuring many from the worlds of art and culture.
