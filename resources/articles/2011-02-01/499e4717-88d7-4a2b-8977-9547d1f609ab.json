In another significant move, HP announced that webOS will be coming to \"other connected devices\" including printers and possibly PCs later this year. Jon Rubinstein, the former Apple executive who helped create the iPod and is now senior vice-president and general manager at HP, unveiled the three devices on stage, demonstrating that they connect with HP's Synergy product - which merges data from the cloud. In the past, WebOS was highly praised as a smartphone OS but Palm didn't succeed in making an impression on the smartphone market in the US or Europe. HP however has substantially more marketing muscle. Now the Palm name appears to be dead: it didn't feature in the presentation. HP calls the TouchPad \"the breakthrough webOS user interface fully realised in the tablet experience\": it has a capacitive multi-touch display, virtual keyboard, instant-on, browser support for Flash Player 10.1 beta and \"access to thousands of webOS applications.\" TouchPad, it says, \"is designed not just for fun but for mobile productivity\". Specs: webOS 3.0, \"true multitasking,\" touch-to-share, instant-on productivity, a 9.7-inch display (1024 x 768 screen resolution), a dual-core 1.2GHz Snapdragon CPU, gyroscope, accelerometer, compass, 16GB/32GB of internal storage, 1.3MP front-facing webcam, support for video calling, 802.11b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth 2.1+EDR, A-GPS (3G model only), \"twice the memory of a Pre 2\" and a set of stereo speakers. It weights 1.6 pounds and is 13.7mm thick. The Pre3 has a 3.6-inch touch screen, 1.4-GHz processor and a full slide-out keyboard, and is, HP says, \"a multitasking professional workhorse that's perfectly balanced for speed and serious fun\". It offers \"business-class email\" (no idea what separates business-class from everyone else class) and \"encrypted data storage to protect critical information and supports industry-standard VPN to connect to corporate networks\". The HP Veer is a smartphone in a \"powerfully small package\", \"the size of a credit card\". HP says it offers \"the higher-end features of a smartphone, such as easy messaging and access to apps, social networks and the web, including support for Flash Player 10.1 beta in the browser for access to rich, Flash-based web content.\" All of which is great and lovely. So what are the prices? What's the delivery date? What's the battery life? And just to add something extra to the mix: the Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Wednesday, according to \"people familiar with the matter\", that the iPad 2 has begun production. And as I was telling you last week, it has a faster processor, a front camera, more memory but the same resolution as the existing one. For delivery when? Expect the iPad 2 to ship some time in the next couple of months. So now you have the TouchPad. Price? Er, unannounced. Delivery? \"Late summer.\" Battery life? \"Eight hours.\" (Recall that Apple claims ten hours for the original iPad, and many people seem to have managed something close to that in real life use). Well, two out of three ain't bad, though it really isn't satisfactory. Price was one of the things that sank the Palm Pre (that and the insufficient number of apps, but it was a very nice mobile device: its multitasking was very nifty well before the iPhone offered it). But John Gruber points out, \"Summer feels like a long time away. If my theory is right, they're not only going to be months behind the iPad 2, but if they slip until late summer, they might bump up against the release of the iPad 3. And not only did they announce this with a distant ship date, they did it with no word on pricing.\" (This is the first mention I've seen anywhere of an iPad 3, by the way.) There's no doubt that WebOS is a really good operating system for mobile devices - it's fast and it's smooth. Here's Engadget's video: From here, it looks rather like Honeycomb or the iPad; big friendly keyboard. (But jeepers, Engadget, would it be possible to spend the time looking at more than just the email program? Trying out the browser? A Twitter app? Any other app, since there must be some for WebOS?) It's not clear either quite what bringing WebOS to PCs means in practice: in parallel with Windows? Instead of Windows? For the biggest PC maker to suggest it might move away from Windows is a tectonic shift if it is going to be implemented. So, will you be waiting for the TouchPad? Does it have what you want?
