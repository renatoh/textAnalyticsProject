The pair look as though they could be locked in a sleeping embrace, the child\u2019s head tucked inside her father\u2019s T-shirt, where she\u2019d been placed by him for safety as he swam, protecting their last dignity. It is a photograph that, like the similar image of the three-year-old Alan Kurdi, has prompted sharp political reaction. Among those who cited the impact of the picture was Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democratic representative, who spoke in emotional terms about it even as congressional Democrats moved to approve a $4.5bn (\u00a33.5bn) humanitarian aid bill to address the plight of migrants at the border. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to see that photograph,\u201d Castro said. \u201cIt\u2019s our version of the Syrian photograph \u2013 of the three-year-old boy on the beach, dead. That\u2019s what it is.\u201d It is an image, however, that also raises a profound challenge: how should we respond to such horror? That question was asked best \u2013 if uncomfortably for reporters and photographers \u2013 by Susan Sontag in her meditation on depictions of human suffering Regarding the Pain of Others, published in 2003, where she asked what it meant for images to \u201cprotest suffering, as distinct from acknowledging it?\u201d \u201cThere is a shame as well as shock in looking at the close up of real horror,\u201d Sontag suggested. \u201cPerhaps the only people with the right to look at images of suffering of this extreme order are those who could do something to alleviate it \u2026 or those who could learn from it. \u201cThe rest of us are voyeurs, whether or not we mean to be.\u201d The issue has become even more pressing, even in the 15 years since Sontag wrote her book, because of the way in which our consumption of images has been changed by a social media explosion that has made engagement ever more ephemeral even as we have been bombarded with ever more pictures. And there is another tension in such images that Sontag identified: a cultural distance she linked to a western audience\u2019s prism of the postcolonial world. \u201cThe more remote or exotic the place,\u201d she wrote, \u201cthe more likely that we are to have full frontal views of the dead and dying.\u201d Too often when we contemplate such images of death they are somehow exotic, other; they seem to depict things that happen to people outside our own experiences. None of which is an argument for not looking. Only for looking harder and more purposefully. Because the reality of the power of Le Duc\u2019s photograph lies in the juxtaposition of multiple levels of shame. The intrusion into the dignity of the dead father and child is also an intrusion into our complacency. Like the photograph of Alan Kurdi, taken by the Turkish photojournalist Nil\u00fcfer Demir on a beach near Bodrum in Turkey, the images seem like ones from elsewhere, relocated into the comfortable assumptions of the US and Europe, where such things are not \u201csupposed\u201d to happen. Although we know that these fatal events occur \u2013 and in the Mediterranean and at the US border on a large scale \u2013 we are both shocked to be confronted by the reality of them, and ashamed to find ourselves examining the evidence. One issue, as a number of those who, like Sontag, have written critically on images of atrocity, is the question of context. Discussing the meaning of Lee Miller\u2019s famous pictures of Dachau concentration camp, the Canadian academic Sharon Sliwinski underlined a key contradiction at the time when the pictures were first published: \u201cThe public bore witness in 1945, but they did not know what they had seen.\u201d The reality is that, although we know a little of the meaning behind what Le Duc has shown us, we still do not know enough. We know that Mart\u00ednez, 25, Valeria and her mother, Tania Vanessa \u00c1valos, arrived last weekend in the border city of Matamoros, Mexico, hoping to apply for asylum in the US. We know too that finding the international bridge they entered the river to swim across on Sunday afternoon, quickly getting into difficulties in the current with their bodies washed on to the Mexican shore of the river. Paradoxically, to protest and not simply acknowledge what we see in Le Duc\u2019s harrowing picture requires that we do not look away; that we demand to know the context and ask the hard questions. That we bear both witness and know what we are seeing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
