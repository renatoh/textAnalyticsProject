Sir Maurice Newbury is an anthropologist at the Natural History Museum, perfect cover for his job as troubleshooting agent of the Crown. He and the demure yet resilient Miss Veronica Hobbes investigate the more bizarre and exotic threats to the Empire. This adventure includes murderous zombies, automatons and a villainous airship company. The setting is London as you've never seen it before, with bulbous dirigibles crowding the skies, steam wagons, and Queen Victoria kept alive by a mysterious medic known as the Fixer. An engaging melodrama that rattles along at a breakneck pace."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
