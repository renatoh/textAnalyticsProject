The teaser shows Hathaway\u2019s character Gloria wake up from a drunken stupor to find out that a creature has attacked Seoul, South Korea. She later finds out that she has a strange connection to what\u2019s happened. The film, which also stars Jason Sudeikis and Dan Stevens, premiered at last year\u2019s Toronto film festival to mixed reviews. The Guardian\u2019s Benjamin Lee called it \u201ca fascinating misfire\u201d while Vanity Fair\u2019s Richard Lawson called it \u201cunexpectedly moving\u201d. It\u2019s the latest film from Nacho Vigalondo, who also directed breakout Spanish thriller Timecrimes and Open Windows, starring Elijah Wood. Hathaway spoke to the Guardian last year about the role that toxic masculinity plays within the film\u2019s unusual plot. \u201cI\u2019m glad that you used the word \u2018toxic\u2019, because it\u2019s very important to say that it\u2019s very different from male energy,\u201d she said. \u201cMale energy is beautiful. Male energy is welcome. Male energy is necessary. Male energy is half the reason why we\u2019re here. That said, there has been a perversion of the beauty of male energy into this macho ideal that I don\u2019t think services anybody ... In terms of my new movie, what our director was saying was that he thinks this energy really has no place in our world any more.\u201d Colossal will be released in cinemas on 7 April"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
