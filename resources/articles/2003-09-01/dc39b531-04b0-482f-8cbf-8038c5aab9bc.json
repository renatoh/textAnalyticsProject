The average life expectancy of a fully active member of the loose-knit criminal clan is just 35. Bertram Byfield lived to be 41 but had spent most of the last six years in prison and narrowly escaped an earlier attempt on his life in January 2002. Although that earlier shooting was described as a domestic incident it does not break that pattern: figures from Scotland Yard show that only a small proportion of shootings involving criminals from Jamaica are predominantly caused by gang activity. Most are linked to issues of 'respect' or robbery. To work as a crack dealer in today's society is to live in a world where virtually all disputes are resolved with extreme violence. The new era of gun violence arrived in Britain in the early Eighties with the arrival of the first wave of Jamaican gunmen. Having been brought up in a society where violent death was commonplace, the new arrivals had a willingness to show and use guns, both against one another and the police, that was completely unprecedented. There are around three murders per day in Jamaica, the vast majority of them in Kingston, a city with a population of just 300,000. The roots of Jamaica's gun law lie in the Seventies, when the two main parties - the People's National Party and the Jamaica Labour Party - established their power bases in the ghettos of downtown Kingston, and reinforced the law with the use of local gun men. Gunmen on the losing side after each election fled to Britain and the United States and many got involved in the drug trade. Initially they used the money to fund the next election campaign but it soon became a free-for-all and incidents of shocking disregard for human life became commonplace. In December 1999, Jamaicans Hyrone Hart, 28, and Kurt Roberts, 19, were jailed for a five-week spree of brutal robberies. In one they burst into the south London home of Avril Johnson and bound her and her husband hand and foot. As her two small daughters, aged seven and 18 months, cowered under the bed, she was shot fatally in the head. Her husband was slashed across the neck and shot but survived when the gunman missed. The pair also murdered two others during their reign of terror. Increasingly the original Yardies are being challenged by gangs of British-born black people who have proved themselves to be capable of just as much violence. 'Children come out of school talking about guns,' says Paul Simpson, a church youth worker on the Stonebridge estate in north London. 'The mentality is so much more vicious now. They don't talk about beating each other up, they talk about killing each other. The simple fact is that with a gun, you are someone; you can hold your own. Without one, you are a dead man.' British-born Ryan, 26, now retired from crime, agrees. 'Most of the time you don't feel safe without a gun because you know everyone else has one. And if you want to deal, you need a gun to stop yourself getting robbed, or to rob others, or just to stop people who want to diss [show disrespect to] you. Most of the time it's OK, but every now and then you pick the wrong person and that's when wars start.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
