A shareholder in the South Korean LG conglomerate has sourced the kits from five companies in the country and has offered them to the UK through a contact who was the former deputy leader of the Conservative party in Westminster council. Nick Markham says he has been in touch with the government, but they are dragging their heels and insisting they won\u2019t make a decision until the kits are tested. He says the production facilities and kits already manufactured are in huge demand, and countries including Ukraine and Romania have already sent military planes out to snap up the supplies. \u201cIt is like the wild west out there. Even Morocco has sent a plane but we can\u2019t get the government to make a commitment. The key thing is put an option on the production or we\u2019re going to lose it,\u201d he said. Markham said he had been in touch with the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who passed the offer on to Lord Bethall, a junior minister who is heading up the procurement effort. \u201cI get that they want to test the kit, but everyone is hiding behind this \u2018we can\u2019t decide until it\u2019s tested\u2019, which is perfectly reasonable, but we will get gazumped,\u201d said Markham. He said JP Lee, the shareholder in LG Chemicals, was \u201can Anglophile\u201d after spending time at the London School of Economics and wanted to help the UK. \u201cHe told me that he doesn\u2019t understand why Britain isn\u2019t out here, that the rest of the world is,\u201d said Markham. Seoul\u2019s fight against coronavirus has been lauded as one of the world\u2019s most successful and more than 120 countries have sought its advice. It took an aggressive approach to testing, and manufacturing of diagnostic kits has been increased to hundreds of thousands a day after approval was granted to export to the US. NHS Scotland has already decided to receive some equipment from South Korea. Markham is the chair of London and Continental Railways, a property company owned by the government, but was previously a TV executive and part of the team that merged Granada and Carlton TV and launched Freeview. He said he took on this role voluntarily because of his contacts in government and says he is \u201csympathetic\u201d to the Department of Health, which has been overwhelmed with offers of help. The kits could be available by the end of next week with production capacity rising to a million kits a week. The 400,000 kits would cost $10m (\u00a38.1m) but all JP Lee needs is for the government to take out an option on the supply. \u201cThen if the kits didn\u2019t pass the PHE test, which they will, or if the government says it has already secured enough testing kits, then nothing comes of it, it\u2019s a win-win situation,\u201d he said. Hancock announced two days ago that his goal was to increase the number of tests for NHS health workers to 100,000 a day by the end of April, but scientists said on Friday they were struggling to get the kits. If the government already has the volume it needs, Markham will stand this effort down, but he is concerned that this is not the case and Britain could be losing a valuable opportunity in the fight against coronavirus. Markham has teamed up with entrepreneur Steve Whatley, founder of the Inchora investment company that focuses on under-served communities, to develop what he called a \u201cOperation Little Boat\u201d drive to get hundreds of testing centres open by using volunteer staff not in the NHS with some clinical experience, such as dentists and optometrists. Last week Sir Paul Nurse, the chair of the Francis Crick Institute, said a \u201cDunkirk spirit\u201d approach was needed to meet the testing challenge. The Department for Health has been approached for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
