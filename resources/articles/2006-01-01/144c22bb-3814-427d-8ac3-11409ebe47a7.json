It has awarded the contract to print around 22m copies of the directory to Einsa Print International, a Spanish company based near Madrid. The decision, which followed a tendering process, is a blow to the Goodhead group, the book's current printer, which is owned by the printing millionaire and Reading football club owner John Madejski. Goodhead's group manager, John Cooling, said the contract loss was \"awful\" news for the firm and was likely to cost \"a sizeable chunk\" of the 180 jobs at its Colchester plant. Exact figures will not be available until tomorrow. Mr Cooling said the firm had been notified on that it had lost the tender for the Phone Book contract - which makes up around 40% of the work at its subsidiary, Benhamgoodheadprint - on December 13. It has held the deal since 1997. Goodhead, based in Bicester, Oxfordshire, was taken private by Mr Madjeski in 2000. Since then, it has been working to secure additional printing jobs to use up the capacity established in Colchester for the BT contract. There are 171 regional editions of the Phone Book, which is delivered to homes and businesses across the UK. BT sold its Yellow Pages business to Yell for \u00a32.1bn in 2001 to help cut its debt. Since then, the Phone Book has featured classified advertising as well as business and residential listings and competes against Yellow Pages for business adverts. Einsa, which was founded in 1971, already supplies directories to telecom firms including TPI (Telefonica) and Page Jaunes (France Telecom)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
