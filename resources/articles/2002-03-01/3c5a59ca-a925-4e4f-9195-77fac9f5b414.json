Millions of people are diagnosing themselves and cutting out certain types of food to the point where having a special dietary need has become trendy. Meanwhile our consumption of organic food and \"green\" health and beauty products is increasingly motivated by the selfish idea that they are better for us rather than by any altruistic notion. This picture of a nation of the self-obsessed emerges from two surveys released by analysts Datamonitor - of eating habits and of ethical consumers. In the first, Datamonitor researchers interviewed people about their eating habits and found that a third were convinced they had a true food allergy - an abnormal response to a food triggered by the immune system - when they may simply have been suffering from food intolerance, which does not provoke an immunological response. This analysis supports a recent study by the British Nutrition Foundation which found that over one in five Britons think they have some kind of food allergy or intolerance despite the fact that a survey of worldwide scientific studies points to less than 1% of adults having full food allergies and less than 2% having milder food intolerance. Silvia Anton, healthcare analyst at Datamonitor, said: \"As society becomes more health conscious, more and more people are self-diagnosing that they or their children have a food allergy and are eliminating certain food types from their diet, possibly depriving themselves of valuable nutrients in the process.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
