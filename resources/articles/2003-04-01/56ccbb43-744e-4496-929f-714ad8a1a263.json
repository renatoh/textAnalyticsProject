Ninety-nine times out of 100, the idea is an embarrassing non-starter, particularly if that writer is somewhat peripatetic and yet decides to arrange the work around a contrived \"theme\". Yet here is that one case in 100. I picked up the book with all the above misgivings, and maybe one or two extra after examining the blurb. (\"A compendium of journeys to the heart of the strange and distant land of Britain.\" Yes ... well, they have to say something.) A few hours later I was almost irritably flicking through the book, wondering if I'd possibly missed anything. To begin with, the introduction was rather winning. \"Thinking myself no end of a wag, I got the features editor of the Sunday Telegraph to commission a profile of an elephant on the grounds that the animal was the most successful teenager in showbusiness; the joke stopped when I found myself having to write 2,000 words about a creature which did nothing except react to food.\" Or: \"Once, banned from driving, I got the features editor of the Guardian to commission a series on towns, and it was only when the articles were appearing that he realised the towns were within a few miles of each other. I had been hitch-hiking between them.\" So, is Rogers no end of a wag? Yes and no. Yes, because he can be very funny, in a quiet, sly way. During a sticky interview with the Duchess of Argyll, the phrase \"inspiration seized her\" pops up with such exact timing that you cannot help laughing, the very wretchedness of her inspiration being so deftly illustrated. And yet this is not the kind of humour that either draws undue attention or feels obliged to be constantly present, like Bill Bryson's. Rogers can be quite as funny as Bryson, but his affection for his interviewees runs too deep, or stirs him too much, for him to feel obliged to wear a cap and bells all the time. One suspects he would find that too easy. He is a writer of more than one note, however much the constant feeling is of hilarity ever ready to bubble over. His piece on the country house singles weekend - every freelance journalist writes one of these at some point - is masterfully poised between comic despair and tactful sympathy. \"We were wary of each other, and of that sense of failure we knew we shared but none of us would mention.\" When he meets his more favoured eccentrics - the mad archivists, the octogenarian triathletes, the man who has taken 22 A-levels - he obviously does not feel that they need to be laughed at. They represent a kind of dedicated, cherishable innocence, which deserves protection from the threats of modernity. Is this whimsy? It would be, if all he were doing were wailing for a vanishing England. But his prose is too good for that, his sensibilities too acute simply to be filed under small-or-big-c conservatism. See how he deals with that most dedicated of wailers, the Prince of Wales, when he recounts being hired as his speechwriter. (There are no indications as to where any of these pieces appeared, which in this instance is particularly frustrating.) There isn't a false note or ugly line in here - although you may have to brace yourself for one or two of the closing lines, which verge, as the job demands, towards pat journalistic elegy. But they are, for the most part, earned. Rogers knows what he's doing with every word; so it's no surprise to find here a very judicious appreciation of RS Thomas (which, incidentally, has overturned most of my objections to the curmudgeonly poet). Internal evidence - a possibly valedictory line at the end of the introduction - suggests that Rogers's career is over. This is surely some mistake. Commission Byron Rogers and you know the job will be done well; your readers will be happy. He has certainly written much more than is collected here. (\"Byron Rogers writes for the Sunday Telegraph, the Guardian, Saga magazine and most other publications,\" says his biography laconically.) You could make plenty more collections than this one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
