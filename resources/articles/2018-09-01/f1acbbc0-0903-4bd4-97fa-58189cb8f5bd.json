Introduced by Greens senator Jordan Steele-John in June, the bill proposes voluntary voting rights for those aged 16 and 17, as well as allowing for electoral enrolment at polling places on election day. Submissions by the Youth Affairs Council Victoria, Children and Young People with Disability Australia, and YMCA Australia argued that many young Australians already held jobs and paid taxes without satisfactory mechanisms for representation in society. \u201c[Lowering the voting age] is a massive statement by the government to say, \u2018We value your voice and your place in our society and in our community,\u2019 which we don\u2019t currently have in other ways,\u201d said Katie Acheson, chief executive officer of Youth Action NSW, in a public hearing this month. Critics, however, warned of the potential polarisation of young voters under a voluntary system, either through US-style political campaigning to \u201cget out the vote\u201d or through self-selection. \u201cThose who chose to vote will be a minority of highly informed young people and those who have been politicised through minority organisations,\u201d the Australian Christian Lobby\u2019s submission said. It preferred to retain the voting age at 18 and promote civic education more generally. Other submissions argued that giving 16 and 17-year-olds voting rights would enhance civic education and understanding. \u201cIt is notoriously difficult to get 18-year-olds to enrol and vote, in part because this can be a time of great upheaval in their lives,\u201d said the dean of law at the University of New South Wales, George Williams, in a submission. \u201cOn the other hand, 16 and 17-year-olds tend to be in a more stable family environment, and still at school. One key advantage of allowing them to vote is that joining the electoral roll and voting for the first time can be combined with civics education.\u201d Though critics contended that young voters might prove politically unaware or would otherwise waste their votes, most submissions discounted that possibility. \u201cWe can definitely make uninformed votes,\u201d Wren Gillett, a 16-year-old member of the Victorian Student Representative Council, told the hearing. \u201cBut I would also then say that I think that is the reality for everyone who is casting a vote.\u201d While still broadly in support of lowering the voting age, some submissions raised concerns that permitting one class of voters to vote voluntarily might lead to a \u201cslippery slope\u201d with potential to undermine the representative nature of Australian democracy. \u201cWe have not had an exception to the compulsory voting since the exception was removed in relation to Indigenous people,\u201d the NSW Law Society argued at the hearing. \u201cThere is now a wealth of research around particularly the equality benefits of that institution.\u201d Associate professor Luke Beck, a constitutional law scholar at Monarch University, agreed. \u201cPutting any holes in that system is dangerous because it would provide ammunition for those who wish to see Australia\u2019s compulsory voting system replaced with a voluntary voting system,\u201d his submission said. Proponents of the voluntary system emphasised the need to encourage early political participation by positioning voting as an empowering tool, rather than an obligation or imposition. \u201cWhat I fear is that making voting mandatory at 16 will make it just a thing to dodge,\u201d said Yakov Clarke-Demaj, a youth adviser at the Centre for Multicultural Youth. \u201cWhen you make it something that\u2019s voluntary and support the choice of coming forward to make an active decision to participate, then I think there\u2019s a greater sticking point through that.\u201d The Young Liberals accused the bill of being an \u201cill-designed and poorly masked attempt by the Australian Greens to increase their vote share\u201d in a submission Steele-John labelled \u201cas close to a troll submission as you could possibly get\u201d. The final report is due in December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
