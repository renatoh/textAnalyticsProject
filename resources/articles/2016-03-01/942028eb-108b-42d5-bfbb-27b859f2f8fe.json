Lawmakers of both parties sharply challenged Comey as the House judiciary committee considered the FBI\u2019s court order to unlock an iPhone owned by Syed Farook, who with his wife killed 14 people at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, California, in December and was killed by law enforcement. Legislators repeatedly accused the Justice Department of overreaching its authority and undermining both privacy and cybersecurity. Several endorsed Congress passing a law settling the boundaries \u2013 something Apple supports \u2013 and accused the FBI of trying to circumvent Congress by launching a lawsuit against Apple. \u201cCan you appreciate my frustration with what appears to be little more than an end-run around this committee?\u201d asked Democratic congressman John Conyers. Representative Zoe Lofgren called FBI demands to weaken Apple\u2019s security a \u201cfool\u2019s errand\u201d that undermined cybersecurity. Comey, a well-respected figure in Congress, likened impenetrable digital encryption used to protect customer\u2019s privacy such as that of Apple to a \u201cvicious guard dog\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re asking Apple to take the vicious guard dog away and let us pick the lock,\u201d Comey said. \u201cIt\u2019s not their job to watch out for public safety. That\u2019s our job.\u201d He said that neither Apple nor any other tech company ought to be permitted to create \u201cwarrant-free spaces\u201d through the use of robust encryption, particularly as mobile and software manufacturers increasingly render user keys inaccessible to themselves. \u201cThe logic of encryption will bring us to a place in the not too distant future where all of our conversations and all our papers and effects are entirely private,\u201d Comey said. Testifying after Comey, Bruce Sewell, Apple\u2019s general counsel, countered the FBI director on multiple points, calling its court order \u201ca way to cut off the debate\u201d rather than engaging in it. \u201cThis is a security versus security issue, and we believe that balance should be struck by Congress,\u201d Sewell said. But Wisconsin representative James Sensenbrenner, a Republican who fought with the security agencies and fellow legislators to rein in the NSA\u2019s domestic phone data collection, warned Sewell: \u201cI can tell you you\u2019re not going to like what comes out of Congress.\u201d \u201cAll you\u2019ve been saying is no, no, no, no,\u201d Sensenbrenner said. Comey repeatedly conceded he had not considered several implications of getting a court to order Apple to unlock an iPhone 5C used by Farook. Comey said \u201cthere was a mistake made\u201d in the FBI working with San Bernardino County officials in December to reset the phone\u2019s password, which potentially cost law enforcement a way into the phone data and out of the impasse. But Comey said he had been assured that all the data from the phone was unlikely to migrate to iCloud. Comey also testified that he had not considered that China might follow the US\u2019s lead in compelling Apple to provide access to customer data, even as he is challenged to thwart Chinese-attributed cyber-attacks. \u201cI have no doubt there are internal implications,\u201d Comey said. Committee chairman Robert Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican, said the Apple case, which has commanded global attention for its implications for cybersecurity, \u201cmay not be an ideal case on which to set precedent\u201d, citing a New York federal judge\u2019s refusal to grant the FBI strikingly similar authority this week. Under Goodlatte\u2019s questioning, Comey continued to back away from his previous assertions that the Apple-FBI dispute concerns only a single iPhone. \u201cIt won\u2019t be a one-time request. It\u2019ll set precedent for other requests from the FBI and any other law enforcement,\u201d Goodlatte said. \u201cSure, potentially,\u201d Comey said. Several lawmakers said that Congress and not judges ought to determine whether security agencies can order tech companies to write software providing access into their products, something technologists refer to as a \u201cbackdoor\u201d. Conyers, the ranking Democrat, said Congress should pursue the debate \u201ceven if the dialogue does not yield the results desired by some in the law enforcement community\u201d. The FBI director repeatedly declined to answer technical questions about either the San Bernardino investigation or how far the FBI\u2019s authorities to compel Apple to write it software might go, pleading ignorance. Some of Apple\u2019s competitors rallied to its support. \u201cThe path to hell starts at the backdoor,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s general counsel, Brad Smith, told the RSA Conference in San Francisco. Smith challenged the computer security industry represented at the gathering to \u201cstand up with Apple in this important case\u201d. As Comey faced a skeptical congressional panel, the US defense chief struck a decidedly different tone in a speech to an audience in San Francisco. Ashton Carter, who has spent much of his tenure reaching out to Silicon Valley, pointed out that his department is \u201cthe largest user of encryption in the world\u201d and urged tech firms to continue \u201cpartnership\u201d with the government. Carter tiptoed around the FBI-Apple dispute, but stated: \u201cThere will not be some simple, overall technical solution \u2013 a so-called backdoor that does it all.\u201d He urged against both \u201ca law hastily written in anger or in grief\u201d and having \u201cthe rules written by Russia or China\u201d. Sewell confirmed that both nations have sought backdoors into Apple customers\u2019 data and warned: \u201cThe world is watching.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
