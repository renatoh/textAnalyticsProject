Under the agreement unveiled yesterday all England's home games will be broadcast exclusively live on the BBC from the start of the 2004-5 season and it will share rights to the FA Cup with BSkyB but will show more live games than previously. The deal will anger the FA's five main sponsors who fear that, with the majority of coverage on the BBC, their ability to advertise during the build-up to games and in commercial breaks will be severely limited. \"We are not pleased about the prospect of not getting the commercial coverage we bought,\" said Andrew Marsden, the UK head of Britvic, which distributes Pepsi in the UK. \"The BBC's priority is not going to be showing our commercial properties and we will be talking to the FA about a number of items concerning exposure that are in our contract.\" Pepsi, McDonald's, Umbro, Nationwide and Carlsberg last year paid \u00a320m each to be the FA's main sponsors and are all thought to be concerned about the implications of the deal, despite the FA sales and marketing director Paul Barber yesterday insisting that it was \"great news\" for its commercial partners. The FA's chief executive Mark Palios also hailed the deal as \"an important step in providing financial stability to the FA\", with the contract believed to be worth \u00a3300m over four seasons. The final value, hit by the worldwide slump in sports rights and the fading lustre of the FA Cup, represents a cut in real terms of \u00a340m per season on the current \u00a3345m, three-year deal. The slump in TV revenues will add to the financial troubles faced by the FA, which has a \u00a3400m commitment to the new Wembley Stadium and has pledged \u00a350m to building the new National Football Centre at Burton-on-Trent. The BBC is paying for the majority of the \u00a3300m contract and its director of sports rights Dominic Coles said yesterday that it was a \"great deal for licence fee payers\". Sky, meanwhile, is believed to be saving its might for the Premier League rights, bids for which are due in today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
