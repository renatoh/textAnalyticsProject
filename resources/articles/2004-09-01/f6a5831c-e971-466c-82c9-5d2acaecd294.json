Sven Jaschan,18, whose mother runs a computer shop in the small northern town of Waffensen, told investigators his original intention was to create a virus, Netsky A, that would fight the Mydoom and Bagle viruses, removing them from infected computers. He developed several versions of Netsky and, after modifying it, created Sasser, which raced worldwide, exploiting a flaw in Microsoft's Windows operating system. It caused infected computers to crash and reboot, making it impossible to work on them. Jaschan was caught after informants seeking a reward tipped off Microsoft. In their indictment, prosecutors chose the cases of three German city councils and a public broadcaster whose systems were disrupted. Prosecutors said they had been contacted by 143 plaintiffs with total damage claims of \u20ac130,000 (\u00a388,500). But they believe that the true figure would run into millions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
