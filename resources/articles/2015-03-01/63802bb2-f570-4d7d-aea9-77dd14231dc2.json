Van Gaal began with a three centre-back system but has since switched between other formations, including a 4-4-2 and 4-1-3-2, and there have also been many changes in team selection. The manager said: \u201cI don\u2019t think that is fair [to call him indecisive]. There was a lot of education we had to do to play the system and the players have to work very hard.\u201d \u00c1ngel di Mar\u00eda, who is suspended for Sunday\u2019s visit of Tottenham Hotspur, and RadamelFalcao are two new players who have struggled this season for their best form. Van Gaal believes this is because all footballers from overseas need time to settle into a new culture and the tempo of the Premier League. Di Mar\u00eda was a record \u00a359.7m and Falcao\u2019s season-long loan is a total of \u00a316m. So should they and any elite foreign footballer be able to settle instantly because this is why they cost so much? \u201cNo. It is because of the market. It is always like that. You pay because of the market and the greatness of Manchester United,\u201d said the manager. Van Gaal did agree the next run of matches is crucial to hopes of Champions League qualification. After Tottenham, United are at Liverpool, then play relegation-threatened Aston Villa and the derby with Manchester City at Old Trafford, before visiting Chelsea. As four of these teams are in and around United, how decisive might the next month be to top-four hopes? \u201cYou are right. It is very decisive, the coming matches,\u201d said Van Gaal. \u201cOf course, after a defeat at home [to Arsenal in the FA Cup], it is also to see the reaction of the team. We play against a very good team in Tottenham. We can see already the next match. But then, still, we have to continue. We are so close with a lot of clubs. We can be second or third. It is not a big difference I believe.\u201d Robin van Persie may not be available until after the international break because of his ankle injury. Van Gaal said: \u201cHe is still with the medical department. He is always training but is training inside, not outside on the pitch.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
