In her essay Homesick for Sadness, she tells us: \u201cI literally slept through that moment of world history, and while I was asleep, the pot wasn\u2019t just being stirred, it was being knocked over and smashed to pieces.\u201d Erpenbeck was initially sceptical about East Berlin\u2019s newfound liberty. \u201cFreedom to travel? (But will we be able to afford it?) Or freedom of opinion? (What if no one cares about my opinion?) Freedom to shop? (But what happens when we\u2019re finished shopping?).\u201d Later, she admits that her experience of this \u201ctransition\u201d was what prompted her to write. Erpenbeck\u2019s refreshing frankness and incisive thinking permeate this collection. Written over two decades, Not a Novel includes snapshots of a happy childhood in the German Democratic Republic, literary criticism on writers she admires (including Hans Fallada, Walter Kempowski, Thomas Mann and Ovid) and meditations on her own work as a writer. We learn of her love of folk tales, how their \u201cintensity\u201d and \u201charshness\u201d infiltrate her own fiction, and how music (she worked as an opera director) taught her \u201cto give shape to the gaps between the words, those mute spaces, to give rhythm to the silence between the words. The pauses are part of the text, they may be the finest part\u2026\u201d The essays explore the subjects \u2013 walls and borders, truth and silence, identity and memory and the limitations of language \u2013 present in her fiction while her autobiographical accounts give valuable context. Despite having slept through a nation\u2019s collapse, Erpenbeck swiftly realised: \u201cEverything that had been called the present up until then was suddenly called the past.\u201d And so she erected another border inside herself, \u201cmade of time, between the first half of my life which was transformed into history by the fall of the wall\u2026 and the second half, which began at that same moment\u201d. She clearly enjoyed a happy childhood. In John we learn about the lovesick schoolboy who would phone her and, refusing to reveal his identity, would quote Beatles lyrics. Years later, when Erpenbeck requested her file from the Stasi, she discovered that they had intercepted John\u2019s daily record of who had arrived and left her apartment block. In Open Bookkeeping her mother\u2019s death in 2008 is reduced to a poignant list of everything Erpenbeck has to find a home for, the accounts she has to close, the refunds that come in and those that don\u2019t. In the first of three lectures for Bamberg University, Erpenbeck explores the impetus behind her debut, The Old Child, where a young woman struggles to adapt to life in a children\u2019s home. She claims: \u201cIf the language that you can speak isn\u2019t enough, that\u2019s a very good reason to start writing\u2026 Whenever I have not been able to understand something, have not been able to capture it in words, that\u2019s when I\u2019ve started writing.\u201d Erpenbeck\u2019s views on totalitarianism, inhumanity, silence and powerlessness coalesce in her later essays and most recent novel, Go Went Gone, which describes Germany\u2019s treatment of African refugees who face Kafkaesque levels of bureaucracy. In her 2018 essay Blind Spots, she contrasts the harsh treatment of refugees today with the joyous acceptance of East Germans when the wall came down and asks: \u201cWhy do we still hear laments for the Germans who died attempting to flee over the wall but almost none for the countless refugees who have drowned in the Mediterranean in recent years, turning the sea into a giant grave?\u201d Erpenbeck\u2019s anger is palpable and this collection reveals both her creative process and the injustices that drive her to write. \u2022 Not a Novel by Jenny Erpenbeck, translated by Kurt Beals, is published by Granta (\u00a314.99).
