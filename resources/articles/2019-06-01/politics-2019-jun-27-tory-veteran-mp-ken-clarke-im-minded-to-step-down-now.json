Speaking to journalists at a lunch on Thursday, Clarke predicted that neither Boris Johnson nor Jeremy Hunt would end up forcing a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. He said that the \u201cthe real world\u201d would take over from the rash promises the pair had made to party members. Clarke, 78, who has represented the Nottinghamshire borough of Rushcliffe since 1970, now appears to be calling time on his long career. He has held the chancellor, home secretary and education secretary posts among other ministerial roles. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to hold yourself out for doing five more years and do the job properly,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m currently minded to step down. I\u2019ve told my people in Nottingham that I\u2019m not standing again. I just think in every walk of life, particularly politics, you got to decide to pack it up before people start dropping hints telling you to pack it up because you can\u2019t do it any more.\u201d Clarke had suggested 2015 would be his last election, but changed his mind and stood again in 2017. Regarding the promises made by Johnson and Hunt in the Conservative leadership election, Clarke said both Labour and the Tories had been pushed towards more fringe views than those of their MPs after altered rules involving party members electing leaders. He said: \u201cBoth parties were doomed, in hindsight, when they followed the 1990s fashion of making our parties democratic. They\u2019re not ready for it. \u201cNow we have the membership, which in both parties\u2019 cases is totally unrepresentative of the vote for the respective parties, which now chooses the party leader. \u201cThat\u2019s why it looks like we\u2019re winding up with Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson, who are two of the people most unrepresentative of public opinion at large that you could possibly imagine.\u201d Johnson has promised to deliver Brexit by 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d, while Hunt has pledged to push for a no-deal departure if needed. Those outcomes were very unlikely to happen whoever won, Clarke said. He added: \u201cThey are pitching themselves at the electorate they are doomed to have to appeal to. I don\u2019t think either candidate believes leaving with no deal makes the slightest sense at all. \u201cJeremy hedges it, Boris does his usual thing of changing the way he expresses it day by day. He\u2019ll make his mind up what he\u2019ll actually do, regardless of what he actually said, if he actually finds himself prime minister, and I\u2019m sure Jeremy will start getting back to common sense if he finds himself prime minister. \u201cNeither of them thinks we\u2019re going to leave with no deal on 31 October. It is, in all practical terms, impossible.\u201d Clarke was dismissive about the leadership campaign as a whole. \u201cWhen the Conservative party can\u2019t think of anything sensible to do in a crisis it always has a leadership election. And I\u2019ve taken part in several of them.\u201d He said that in the end \u201csanity and the real world\u201d would deliver a moderate Conservative government. \u201cWe might return to normality. But it\u2019ll be a different normality. It\u2019ll take a generation to cure the divisions that this issue has caused. It has broken the political system. We will have multi-party parliaments. I think if we had an election, god knows how many parties would be in and what the respective balance would be.\u201d Clarke reiterated his threat to potentially back a motion of no-confidence against a new Tory government if it pushed for no deal over leaving the EU, saying he faced a dilemma. \u201cAs I don\u2019t think that the declared policy position of either candidate is remotely credible, nor do I think it is what either of them think it is what they\u2019re going to pursue, I shall wait to see what the prime minister says he and the government he forms actually intends to do,\u201d he said. This, Clarke added, was a luxury he could indulge in as a veteran not seeking to stand again. \u201cI don\u2019t want the new leader to make me parliamentary under-secretary for nuts and bolts.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
