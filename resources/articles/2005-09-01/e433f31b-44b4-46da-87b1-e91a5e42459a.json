As the US released crude oil and petroleum products from its strategic stockpile, so Opec said it would produce an extra million barrels a day and the International Energy Agency said its members would release 2m barrels a day for 30 days to relieve the shortage. By that time it is hoped that some of the shut US refineries - accounting for 10% to 12% of US output - will be repaired. By yesterday evening the price of Brent crude had fallen another 2.6% to $64.83 a barrel, well down on the crisis level of $70 a barrel. It would be a serious mistake if governments were seduced into believing that the problem has been solved, because it emphatically has not. The shutting of key US refineries in the Gulf of Mexico last week in the wake of the hurricane was another brutal reminder of the fragility of oil supplies. It has been a case of \"one darned thing after another\" as the price of crude has almost doubled in two years. The main reason is demand: the economies of the US and Asia, China in particular, have been stronger than expected. But there have also been a series of international supply worries: fears about the stability of Saudi Arabia, a strike in Nigeria, the activities of speculators, worries about the security of Iraqi supplies, fears that Iran might cut output to force acceptance of its nuclear power station plans - and now a hurricane in a vulnerable part of the US. The reason the surge in oil prices has not - yet - had the catastrophic effect of the oil shocks of the 1970s and early 1980s is that this time the rises have been gradual, not abrupt. Thanks to conservation induced by the shocks, we use oil and petrol more efficiently than before. The price of oil, allowing for inflation, is still lower than 25 years ago, while governments are much better at using monetary policy (mainly interest rates) to steady their economies at times of turbulence. It is anyone's guess what will happen to oil prices now. Even seasoned analysts, most of whom did not predict this year's increase, are loathe to make unqualified forecasts. In theory, if there is a slight surplus of supply over demand - once speculative activity and the effects of a likely slowdown in Chinese and US GDP growth are taken into account - then it would be unsurprising if prices come off the boil. But no one knows the full effects of speculation and when there is little spare capacity - especially in refining - small disruptions can have a disproportionate effect even before factoring in fresh international upheavals. It should not require traumatic events to promote greater conservation. Even before the latest price rise, it made long-term sense to diversify away from our dependence on a resource that is not only starting to run out but which will increasingly make us dependent on supplies from the volatile Middle East. Small wonder the award of remaining North Sea licences, the results of which are due today, shows record interest in exploiting Britain's dwindling reserves. After past oil hikes the world was forced to use oil more efficiently. This happened not as a result of a sudden spike but because prices stayed high for several years. Cambridge Research Associates reckon prices would have to remain at $75 a barrel for three years to have the same economic clout as the oil shock of the early 1980s. In this vital area, governments must act. If left to market forces alone, conservation may never happen on the scale required. Despite recent rises, US petrol prices are too cheap to deter a typical motorist from making an unnecessary journey. The latest rise has been halted for now but that is no reason why governments, especially in the US, should not be much more pro-active in promoting conservation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
