The gag, aired on Tuesday, about throwing the substance at \u201cunpleasant characters\u201d instead of milkshakes, was the subject of a police complaint about incitement to violence. It was also criticised by Nigel Farage \u2013 who had a milkshake thrown on him while campaigning in Newcastle during the EU elections \u2013 and Theresa May, among others. Brand is reported to have apologised to an audience in Henley, in Oxfordshire, on Thursday, the same day as Scotland Yard said it was investigating the comedian after receiving a complaint. \u201cLooking back, it probably was somewhat a crass and ill-judged joke that might upset people,\u201d the Sun quoted Brand as saying. \u201cOf course I\u2019d never do anything like that. It was purely a fantasy. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d However, she reportedly added she did not think it was a mistake, while acknowledging that others might disagree. Brand also stressed she did not mention Farage by name and that female politicians and public figures faced \u201cfar worse\u201d threats on a daily basis. Farage, the Brexit party leader, had accused her of inciting violence and urged the police to act although it is understood that neither he nor his party made the official complaint. Brand made the offending comment on the BBC Radio 4 Heresy programme in response to a question about the \u201cterrible time\u201d in politics that the country was going through. She said: \u201cWell, yes, I would say that but that\u2019s because certain unpleasant characters are being thrown to the fore and they\u2019re very, very easy to hate and I\u2019m kind of thinking: \u2018Why bother with a milkshake when you could get some battery acid?\u2019\u201d It was met with roars of laughter from the audience, before she clarified: \u201cIt\u2019s purely a fantasy, but I think milkshakes are pathetic, I honestly do, sorry.\u201d Heresy\u2019s host, Victoria Coren Mitchell, said at the end of the show that she hoped Brand\u2019s comments had not caused offence. She later responded to Farage\u2019s tweet complaining about them saying: \u201cI would totally have had you down as a free speech man. Especially when it comes to jokes.\u201d May\u2019s official spokesman said the BBC should explain why it was appropriate content for broadcast. The corporation has said it regretted any offence caused and announced it would be editing the programme to remove Brand\u2019s joke from its online streaming service and any future airings. As of Friday afternoon, Ofcom said it had received 287 complaints about Heresy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
