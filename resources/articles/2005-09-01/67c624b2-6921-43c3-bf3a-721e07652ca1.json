Under Spanish law the unnamed prisoner had been allowed to keep her child in a mothers' wing of Granada jail until her fourth birthday. The mother banned her from playing with other prison toddlers to \"preserve her origins\", El Pa\u00eds reported. A court declared this \"state of total isolation [was] damaging to the child\". The child's father is also in jail. The girl, now four, has been handed to relatives."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
