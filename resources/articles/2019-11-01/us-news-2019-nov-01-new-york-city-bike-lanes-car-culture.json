The city council passed legislation this week that will see $1.7bn invested in road infrastructure over 10 years in a move that it is hoped will transform city streets and dramatically improve safety for cyclists and pedestrians. The New York city council speaker, Corey Johnson, who introduced the \u201cstreets master plan\u201d bill and is anticipated to run for mayor in 2021, said after the vote: \u201cThe way we plan our streets now makes no sense and New Yorkers pay the price every day, stuck on slow buses or risking their own safety cycling without protected bike lanes \u2026 I want to completely revolutionise how we share our street space, and that\u2019s what this bill does. \u201cThis is a roadmap to breaking the car culture in a thoughtful, comprehensive way, and I am so proud to pass this bill today.\u201d While cycling is on the rise in New York \u2013 the number who ride several times a month grew by 26% between 2012 and 2017, according to the city\u2019s most recent cycling trends report \u2013 more cyclists are dying. So far this year there have been 25 cyclist deaths, the highest number in 20 years, and pedestrian and cyclist fatalities have risen by 24%. The new law requires the city to release and carry out a \u201cmaster plan\u201d every five years that prioritises street safety, public transport use, cutting vehicle emissions and access for people with disabilities. The first plan, due in December 2021, will include 150 miles of bus lanes protected either physically or by camera and 250 miles of protected bike lanes \u2013 meaning they are physically separated from traffic \u2013 over five years, improved bus stops and passenger information and changes to traffic lights to speed up buses. Within the first two years, the plan pledges to create more than 1m sq ft of pedestrian space. The second, due in 2026, will commit to a full, connected cycle lane network, protected bus lanes on all viable routes and accessible pedestrian signals at 2,500 intersections in five years. While New York has some way to go before it can compete with cycle-friendly leaders such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam, the new law marks a significant moment for the city, which has prioritised cars since the 1920s. Marco te Br\u00f6mmelstroet, professor in urban mobility futures at the University of Amsterdam and academic director of Urban Cycling Institute, said the change in approach represents a \u201cradical shift in the logic that underlies choices in the design of street infrastructure\u201d. He added: \u201cWhere there is a century-long tradition in the US, and in much of the world that followed examples from the US, that puts the speed and efficient flow of vehicles central, and that made travel times the undisputed central goal of infrastructure planning, this new law seems to make this secondary to choices that put justice central.\u201d He said New York has the potential to set an \u201cinspiring example\u201d to other US cities if it can show that the law not only functions but also has a positive impact on other aspects of society. Nearly 800,000 New Yorkers cycle regularly, according to city statistics. It is estimated that more than 490,000 bicycle trips are made every day in the city \u2013 three times more than the number made 15 years ago. As of last year, there were a total of 1,240 miles of bike lanes in the city \u2013 480 of which were protected. Meanwhile, use of Citi Bike, New York\u2019s on-street cycle hire scheme, is on the rise. Close to 2.5m trips were made in September, with an average of 80,475 a day. In comparison, September 2018 saw nearly 1.9m trips and an average of 62,616 trips a day. But safety remains an issue for many riders and potential cyclists amid increased congestion on roads \u2013 in part because of services such as Uber and Lyft \u2013 and a crisis on the subway. Jon Orcutt, a spokesman for Bike New York, said the new measures, especially protected bike lanes, will save lives and encourage more people to cycle. \u201cThe traffic in the rest of the street is so heavy that if you want to really build cycling into an option for people, other than the small number of courageous souls who are willing to throw elbows with taxis and trucks, you have to give people separation from the vehicles.\u201d During the evening commute on the Williamsburg stretch of the Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway, a popular cycle lane, both cyclists and drivers said they were in favour of more protected cycle lanes. Alex Price, 24, who works in emergency construction and lives in Brooklyn, said: \u201cIt\u2019s always this game of should I get on the pavement or should I stay on the street? It really depends how busy the traffic is, both cars and pedestrians, so yeah, just having a cycle lane makes things easier.\u201d Grace Dulik, 27, recently started using Citi Bike to and from her home and work at a natural food company in Brooklyn, but is afraid to take routes that do not have cycle lanes. \u201cI have multiple people in my network of friends who have been killed by hit-and-run by drivers, so it definitely seems to be a big issue \u2026 it seems like you can do everything right as a biker and still get hit by a car,\u201d she said. Waiting to collect a passenger nearby, taxi driver Andre Locke, 20, from Queens, said he supports protected cycle lanes. \u201cI say make it so that if someone wants to ride their bike in the street that they stay in the bike lane \u2026 If they do that, there\u2019ll be less people getting hit.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
