When my mate Kev said he'd like to come too, I said it'd be nice to have some company. Our first argument flared when Kev informed me he'd packed half an ounce of grass into his rucksack. We both thought the holiday had ended early when the woman operating the airport's security machine said 'what's that?' Fortunately, she was pointing at the tent poles stuffed in Kev's bag. We hired a car on my credit card (Kev said he'd pay me back), and set out to a pub west of Dublin, where Kev's friend of a friend had promised to put us up for the night. The friend was nowhere to be seen. We headed into the countryside and in desperation pitched the tent on a grass verge by the lights of the car, in pouring rain. Next day, after being woken early by an angry local, we drove slowly across to Galway. The city was battered by hurricane force winds and horizontal rain. I sat in the car, stared out at the weather and wondered what had possessed me to come to such a place for my first holiday in four years. Later, I went for a walk by the sea, stumbling across a dead sheep and getting repeatedly attacked by midges. In a pub the following day, Kev discovered he'd left his bank card at home, meaning I would have to lend him cash for the rest of the trip. With holiday budget now slashed, I found myself agreeing to shameful acts such as sneaking on to campsites and leaving a restaurant (after enjoying the best of Irish hospitality) without paying. Back in Dublin, we got rid of the car and left our luggage in the 24-hour lockers at the bus station before scraping together my last euros for a couple of pints. On our return, we noticed a tiny sign by the locked bus station door saying it wouldn't reopen until 7am the next day. Our flight was at 6.30am. Kev spent the night on a bench in a police station, next to a pissed bloke with smelly feet, while I caught a bus to the airport to sort out a later flight, adding yet more expense to my supposedly cheap holiday. Four years later, and Kev still hasn't paid me back in full. \u00b7 Have you had a crap holiday? Please write in and tell us about it.
