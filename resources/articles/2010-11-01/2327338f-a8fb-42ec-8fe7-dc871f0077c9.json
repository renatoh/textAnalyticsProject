Chelsea had long insisted that they did not intend to add to their playing staff in the winter transfer window, when prising players away from rival clubs is notoriously difficult. Yet the untimely loss of both first-choice centre-halves to chronic injuries has exposed a lack of depth in their squad and may prompt a rethink. Alex, who is in Qatar with the Brazil team and was surprisingly reported to have trained tonight, will undergo exploratory arthroscopic surgery on his right knee before the end of the week after suffering swelling in the joint in the wake of Chelsea's recent defeat by Liverpool at Anfield . The champions will scrutinise the results of that operation but already fear they will be without him for up to eight weeks. His absence is compounded by Terry's admission that he could be out for \"months\" because of a sciatic nerve problem that has dogged him since the end of last season but has worsened in recent weeks and leaves him regularly in agony. The England defender missed Sunday's 3-0 capitulation to Sunderland, in which Ancelotti opted to pair Branislav Ivanovic with Paulo Ferreira at centre-back, with the visitors duly inflicting the worst home defeat of the Roman Abramovich era. Even after that loss, Ancelotti insisted his squad were strong enough to maintain the club's Premier League defence and pursuit of a first Champions League title. Yet, with Ricardo Carvalho sold and now a regular sold to Real Madrid and the Dutch youngster Jeffrey Bruma still largely untested, there is an acceptance within the club that the squad is \"light\" in central defence. Chelsea do have the option of recalling the England Under-21 utility player Michael Mancienne from his season's loan at Wolverhampton Wanderers in January, though he has made only two league starts for the Londoners and has largely been used in midfield by the Molineux club. There has been interest expressed previously in the Benfica centre-half David Luiz, whose price has proved too expensive in the past, and Gary Cahill at Bolton Wanderers while Newcastle United's under-used Steven Taylor will effectively be available at the right price in January. That will hardly allay the immediate sense of crisis generated by the absence of the first-choice centre-half pairing. The champions, beaten twice in three games, travel to Birmingham City on Saturday to confront Nikola Zigic, with Ancelotti considering playing Bruma or Ferreira alongside Ivanovic. Michael Essien, who would represent a further short-term option in the centre of defence, is suspended for the trip to St Andrew's and at Newcastle the following weekend, when Chelsea will potentially be unsettled by Andy Carroll. In addition, Ivanovic is one booking from a one-match ban. Alex travelled to Qatar with the Brazil squad to be assessed by their medical staff, who concurred with Chelsea's initial diagnosis. He will undergo the keyhole surgery in the next few days. Terry spent today meeting club doctors to discuss how best to combat the nerve problems he has been experiencing in his right leg. Chelsea insist the pain is not related to the back injuries he has suffered in the past, with the England coach, Fabio Capello, pleased the 29-year-old has opted to get to the root of the pain that has unsettled him since the tail-end of last season and ruled him out of the national side's past four matches. \"It's a good decision,\" said Capello. \"He has played all the games this season with injections. Every game. You can't play with injections all the time \u2013 it is impossible.\" \"Basically, I am trying whatever is suggested,\" said Terry, who has been referred to a nerve specialist in London and may also fly to Italy to meet a specialist team trusted by Ancelotti. \"I'm at my wits' end. I know I won't play on Saturday against Birmingham City, but beyond that there are no clues. It could be weeks, it could be months. The pain is dreadful and it can come on when I am driving, when I am having dinner, even in bed. People are saying it could be my posture, but nobody really knows. Every time I jog or warm up, I don't feel right. It has been that way for a while, but this is different now. \"It is at a point where I can't carry on with it. I used to be able to make it through games because the adrenaline gets going and you blank the pain out, but now there really is no decision to make. After games I am in agony and not sleeping at all. I used to play with pain at seven out of 10. Now? It's 10 out of 10. I need to take a few weeks rest, see a couple of specialists and solve the problem.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
