However, his name is actually Mick Cusworth and he is in fact a student at the Department of Archaeology, University of Sheffield. Apologies. 'They respect me,' Mick Cusworth, now in his final year studying archaeology at the University of Sheffield, says of his lecturers, 'because I know how to dig.' Twenty years ago it was precisely because Cusworth knew how to dig that respect was the last thing he earnt. In fact, he wasn't earning anything. He was a member of what Margaret Thatcher termed 'The Enemy Within', he was the fifth column chipping away at a society in thrall to free enterprise, he was a miner and a member of the National Union of Mineworkers. And he was on strike. Cusworth was among the first miners to strike when, in March 1984, it was announced that the Cortonwood pit in the South Yorkshire village of Brampton Bierlow, where he worked, was to close - just two days after they had been told that the high-quality seam of silkstone coal they mined had another five years' life and three weeks after 80 miners had been transferred there. Within a month, only 21 of the Coal Board's 174 pits were still operating, as miners across the country picketed against a 5.2 per cent pay offer and a programme of pit closures. Twenty years ago, in April 1984, Brampton was awash with police and media. The Miners' Welfare and Social Club was the Strike Control Centre from where Channel 4 broadcast live - and TV crews from Holland, France and Germany sent back reports. In the two decades since the strike there has been very little news from this part of Yorkshire. When Ian McGregor, Margaret Thatcher and the Coal Board squared up to Arthur Scargill, Mick McGahey and the NUM, this part of Britain was seldom out of the news. There were pitched battles between pickets and police, vox pops to gauge how strong support was. Every miner and miner's wife was buttonholed for a quote, whether at the picket line at the top of Pit Lane or outside the parish hall, where food parcels were being distributed to men whose families had to survive on \u00a311.75 a week from the strike fund. (In the hall a notice was pinned to the wall: 'Beware! A vulture is going round the estates of Brampton offering a few quid for watches, bracelets, rings, etc.' Next to this, in a bolder hand: 'Beware! A vulture is going round the coalfields offering a few quid for your jobs.') On the picket line at the entrance to the colliery, conversation was boisterous, forthright, virulently anti-Thatcher and pro-union. 'As far as I'm concerned,' commented the then NUM branch official Mick Carter, 'if we lose this, every trade unionist - and if you're not a trade unionist then you can bugger off now - might as well tear their card up. It won't be worth anything.' The colliery is, of course, now long gone - blown up, razed to the ground, and the mineshafts capped. Drive into the village and where the 'last stand' took place there are large gates, held together by a rusting chain and padlock. Arranged in front of the gates are blocks of concrete similar to the anti-terrorist blocks outside the Houses of Parliament or the American Embassy in London. Beyond the gate is an untended tarmac track, covered in moss and weeds. The miners used to walk down Pit Lane at 4am every morning to start their shift. Carry on down the lane now and the way is blocked by light industrial units collectively named Cortonwood Enterprise Zone, where Windsor Foods and Aston Seals go about their business. Beyond that, there's a Royal Mail sorting depot and beyond this is what used to be the colliery. The only reminder of its former purpose is a grass-covered slag heap, in front of which there are new employers. A huge B&amp;Q DIY store, a Matalan that is under construction, and a drive-thru McDonald's - 'now hiring'. There is also a petrol station and a Morrison's supermarket - 'over 100 wines under \u00a33 each'. The only reminders of its previous existence are a series of black and white photographs of the colliery inside the supermarket. In 1984, photographer Steve Pyke and I covered the strike for the New Statesman magazine. We visited the pickets in Yorkshire and the strike-breakers in Nottinghamshire. The latter are still held in the utmost contempt by Brampton's former miners. 'There's a bloke that walks past my house every morning,' Mick Carter tells me, 'and I still say, \"Bastard!\" A scab's a scab - you can never cure a scab.' This feeling is still reflected throughout the village. Jim Graham, who now runs the general stores, came across the same scab twice the previous week. 'The second time were in the petrol station. He were laughing and chatting ... ' Graham, a large and powerful man, pauses for effect, 'then he went very quiet when he saw me.' Carter, like many of the other miners, was transferred to another pit when Cortonwood was finally closed in 1985. 'I was a marked man,' he recalls. 'I had friends in management, and the first day there one came to me and said, \"Mick, watch your back, kid.\"' This, of course, was due to his vociferous activism during the strike, but there was another reason he 'hated every minute' of his time at Silverwood. 'In a pit village you work together, and you play together. Then we were turned into commuters, and you don't have friends, you have...' Carter's voice reaches a pitch of venom, '\"work colleagues\". The social cohesion was gone, there was a fragmentation, and that takes some adjusting to. Most of the lads were transferred; we were shoved around like gypsies.' Carter doesn't work any more, because he's too sick: 'I've no worries,' he deadpans, 'no money and I'm dying.' In fact, he should be dead already, according to his doctors. He reaches for his morphine with a tattooed forearm - 'It was a swallow, but it's migrated' - and takes the medicine that helps with his inoperable stomach cancer. 'I'm still battling; I'm not going.' Mick Cusworth went straight down the pit from school, at 17. The strike was called a day after his 20th birthday. 'After the pit shut we were moved around from Cortonwood - here and there and everywhere. And I said there's no way I'm being moved around. So I did security jobs and other really dead-end jobs, then I decided to go back to school and get qualifications. When I was a child I wasn't good at school; I used to cause trouble and act about - which I wish I'd never done. But I were always interested in history.' He is now specialising in pre-history at Sheffield, from the Neolithic times to the Iron Age. 'I never thought I'd be doing this, but I did always wonder how I could improve myself. It took me six year to get in, 'cos I left school with no qualifications. Did me GCSEs to get into university and I've done pretty well. I don't expect to get a top degree, as I'm dyslexic, but I'm still going.' That, the notion of the ongoing and continuous battle, is what defines the former miners of Brampton. None of them has given up over the intervening 20 years and the strike is still fresh in their memories. 'I look back at the times before the strike, and it was more of a time when you could speak to anybody,' Cusworth remembers. 'You would walk down the street and people would respect you. Nowadays, it's not like that. The area ... well, there's a lot of strangers now, but some that were there look at you like you're a nonentity.' While trying to find miners we had spoken to and photographed during the strike, we would be told that they had moved away. The end of the strike didn't just mean the death of the pit, it also meant the dismantling of an entire community. When Mick Carter talks about working at Silverwood, he points out that while it's only eight miles away, for a community used to the early- morning stroll down Pit Lane, it might as well have been in Cornwall. Len Holler hasn't worked since the dispute. Now 75, 'since January, so I don't have to pay my television licence', he can only get around on a walking frame, following a domestic accident. His wife suffers from chronic emphysema, and the tubes from her oxygen machine snake round the house. 'Aye, we're both buggered,' he asserts, as he struggles up from repairing a home-made wheelchair ramp at the front door of the house - a house which, like all those on his street, were pit houses. Inside Holler's house are mementoes of the strike and his life as a miner. There are pictures of Cortonwood, his pit checks are on the wall (one - number 511 - now serves as his key fob), the last brass pay tag (number 1,485) and a reminder of a more recent industrial dispute in the shape of a 'Support Your Firefighters' sticker. The name plaque from his locker sits above two ornamental brass mining lamps that were a gift from his father, who, of course, was also a miner - 'me dad, me uncle, me grandad all worked down Cortonwood. I left school on Friday,' says Holler, casting his mind back to 1946, 'and started Monday at pit yard.' A more potent reminder of the strike is on the coat-rack inside his front door. Battered and frayed, but still with the faded button badges that proclaimed his allegiance to the NUM, is the cap he wore on the picket line. He is more than happy to put it on again for a photograph. In the bedroom, with a single bed for Holler and an easy chair for his wife, who hasn't been able to sleep lying down for the past three years, is a map of the South Yorkshire coalfields, listing the 60 pits which used to operate in the region. The only physical reminder of an industry that used to define the area is 15 minutes from Brampton, at Barnsley Main. On the journey there with Holler and Jim Graham, Holler provides a running commentary of what used to be. 'On the left there were the tractor sheds ... I used to drink at that club there ... did me training there ... spent one day there getting the pit ponies up ... ' Then we arrive at Barnsley Main, where the head machinery stands like a monument: an eerie, slightly spooky testament to the fact that these mines were built to last. A reminder that communities were built around these pit-shafts, unlike the light-industrial units that now surround this memorial. 'Where they pay,' as Mick Carter puts it, 'nowt a yard.' Along the Dearne Valley the mines employed between 60,000 and 70,000 men - there were at least a dozen mines in a five-mile radius from Brampton. Now, the employers are call centres and supermarkets. These days, up and down the Dearne Valley, the most common sound from the former collieries and slag heaps is the motorised roar of trail bikes rather than mine machinery. The heaps, lunar-like and razed to the ground, capture the evening sun in their oil-slicked pools. Then there are golf courses, manicured and busy, as the leisure industry continues its inexorable march. The only memorial to a bygone age is a former head wheel, with the simple inscription: 'Cortonwood Colliery, 1875-1985'. There is, at least, one miner left in Brampton, though. Preparing himself for a Saturday night out, the sides of his head freshly shaven and his selection of tattoos vying for attention among the marks of his trade - 'I've got black nails, scar tissue, cuts, nicks, scratches, broken bones' - Malcolm Fitzpatrick considers his position. 'Aye,' he admits, 'there's not many of us left.' Fitzpatrick now mines 15 miles away, near Rotherham. 'It's quite a long way from here, to be honest,' he says. 'Some blokes from Nottingham working there now do a 40-mile round trip. The same blokes I was chucking bricks at back then I'm working with down the pit now. Funny how things change.' 'How long's a piece of string?' Fitzpatrick replies to the question of how much life is left in his current pit. 'One minute it's no time at all, it's going to shut. Then it's, \"There'll only be eight weeks if we don't accept a flexible working package.\" We accepted the flexible working patterns, but we weren't given any choice in the matter. It was basically: do it or we'll close your pit. And no option of transfers, not really.' This brings to mind Mick Carter's comment about the future of the post-strike union, and whether it has served the men in the way it used to. 'The union after the strike had been gelded, because following the strike there were no negotiations. We always said that the Coal Board never gave the miners 'owt - miners have never been given anything in their history. Everything we got cost strikes, cost lost hours, cost deaths. We had to fight for everything.' Fitzpatrick was at the front line of the last stand, the last fight in 1984, as a full-time flying picket - 'For me sins,' he laughs. Twenty years old, he grew his hair for the first time in his life as a form of camouflage - 'I finished up with a ponytail on it' - and roamed the country on 'one long buzz. It were fun. I enjoyed meself. I could basically do I what I wanted and no recriminations, unless you got caught, which didn't happen very often. I spent about six hours in the nick, that was about it and I got beat up by the police once. It gave me licence to run riot round the country and were the best time I ever had. Twelve months on the run, no problems.' Despite the privations and hardship, the war of attrition with the government and the poor press, this sense of actually enjoying the strike is, to a certain extent, echoed throughout Brampton. Not only do they look back with pride at the conflict, they also missed the camaraderie that defined the era. 'Comradeship,' says Jim Graham, simply. 'We were all in it together,' agrees Keith Gayle. 'It were great. Going out and seeing people, that were best. Right laughs, nice weather and we felt we were free. We used to nip down to Nottingham quite a few times. Sneaking down through all the police lines. When I used to go picketing at Cortonwood of a morning, it would be about four o'clock, then come back and it's, \"Right, we're off to wherever\" and straight off. Never got stopped in my car; I was the one that always got through. They just didn't expect a little Reliant Robin to be carrying flying pickets.' When Cortonwood was still functioning it provided a life and structure to the village that existed around it; it was an umbilical attachment. It wasn't simply a question of the noble miner hewing away at the coalface - an entire infrastructure existed around it. Telephonists, store workers, men to load the coal on to trains, men to drive the trains underground. Secretaries, fitters, electricians, repairs and management. 'We had a very good relationship with our manager at Cortonwood,' points out Carter, 'then it stopped. He had his orders and they came from above.' An infirm 77-year-old, Cliff Wraith was about to retire when the strike started. 'I were still on the books,' he acknowledges, 'but I were getting nowt. But I were still going to stick with me mates.' Of course he was going to stick with his mates, these were friendships and bonds that stretched back to when he was 14. 'I left school on Friday and on Monday morning I started down at Parkgate.' 'My lad was murdered, you know,' he says without prompting. 'Me youngest, with a carving knife.' His tone is flat as he retells the story of how he help set his son up in business as a roofer and there was a little local difficulty with a rival firm that soon spiralled out of control - or, as Wraith puts it with typical Yorkshire understatement, 'It created a bit of bother.' There was then a fight, which ended up with one of the rival roofers in hospital; the vendetta then ended with his son being stabbed with a knife that, moments earlier, had been used to cut some teacakes. The murderer got five years. 'I passed him on the street the other day,' Wraith says. This may be an extreme example, but there is a palpable sense of loss in Brampton. Of lost health, loved ones, work, community. Mick Carter, much like Mick Cusworth, decided to get educated after being made redundant from Silverwood. 'I never had the opportunity when I were younger. I went to Northern College and did a diploma. I was going to do a thesis on the rise and fall of the Dearne Valley from 1850 to 2000 - an industrial and economic history of a valley that were founded on glass, mining and brickworks.' He continued his studies at York University. Then, in 1995, he developed a cancerous lump and underwent a seven-day operation, followed by a further seven weeks' recuperation, where he was shunted from ward to ward. 'I told the doctors, \"It's only geriatric and maternity I've not been in. Can we arrange it?\"' He returned to university, then contracted peritonitis again - with the added bonus of gangrene. This failed to stop his studies, and he was offered a scholarship to study for a PhD. Then came a double blow: the cancer returned and, at the same time, his wife Ann developed a heart condition, from which she died in 2002. The tales of heartache continue: the miner who burnt down his house when his wife ran off with another woman; the miner who returned to work after the strike only to die of a brain haemorrhage four weeks later, which locals believe was the result of a beating he took at the hands of the police. He was 19. 'I've seen the good times and the bad,' says Alan Hartley, while taking a ruminative puff on his pipe. Hartley was the colliery manager at Cortonwood when the closure was announced, yet he was perhaps one of the last to hear about it. It was, he admits, 'a bolt from the blue. It was a total surprise to me; in fact, the workforce heard the news before I did.' In the days when the colliery was operating, the pit was, quite naturally, the focus of the village, followed by the Miners' Welfare Club. Twenty years on, and from the outside the club looks like any other working man's club in northern Britain - run-down on the outside, and once inside there is the Tap Room to the right, with a lunch-time fug of cigarette smoke, and to the left a function room. So far, so typical. But step beyond the function room and there is a freshly painted annexe that will soon be a community creche, which in turn will lead out to a play area overlooking the sports ground when further funds are found. Upstairs is the Healthy Living Centre and offices occupied by the YMCA and ACE (Action in the Community for Employment). On the sprung dancefloor of what used to be the club's function room are the computers belonging to Dearne Valley College's IT class. From the window of the admin office is a view that used to take in seven neighbouring pits. 'Seventy five per cent of the welfare clubs in Yorkshire have closed down,' states Hartley, but he and his fellow trustees are not going to allow that to happen in Brampton. Formed in 1925, it has now been renamed Brampton Welfare Community Club. 'It was originally for miners, ex-miners and their families,' he explains, 'but obviously our situation has changed. So the club has evolved into something for the community.' 'We want to do as much as we can for the youth,' adds co-trustee Sid Bailey. 'It's what the community needs.' The trustees and the welfare secretary make for a disparate bunch, when their roles during the strike are considered. Hartley was part of the management, with which Carter admits the NUM always had a good relationship at Cortonwood, while Bailey and Frank Hodgkiss were miners. Barry Morgan, the secretary, was a policeman. 'It were fine, actually,' remembers Morgan of the strike, 'one or two threats. I mean, I've lived in the village all my life. Me father was a miner, and me grandfather - and I never got any trouble at all. I knew all the people, I knew why they were out on strike there was a principle at stake - and they knew that I had a job to do. There was a sort of mutual respect there.' Hartley picks up on this train of thought. 'There are people in this village now who look upon me... not very kindly. But I think I've demonstrated my loyalty to the village.' That loyalty is reflected in his work for the welfare club, which they have transformed into a one-stop shop for education, childcare, health, employment and sports. Their avowed aim is to 'build Brampton back up, because the strike, and its aftermath, killed the village. We are only on phase one of our plans, which we've been able to reach with \u00a3200,000 funding from the Coalfield Regeneration Trust - plus help from the borough council, plus partnership money, plus rent from the offices...' The one abiding impression of Brampton is that they were dealt a very bad hand - 'It's sad, but it happened' - and that they will dig themselves out of a hole that was not their creation. Having lived through the most divisive industrial dispute in living memory, there is generally a healthy scepticism of party politics. 'The Labour Party now?' Jim Graham chuckles before answering, 'Light blue.' Cusworth is equally dismissive. 'Politics? Very difficult to understand.' 'I think they are still very strongly politicised,' says John Healey, who represents Brampton in parliament, 'but they're not active. In the same way that social cohesion has gone in Brampton, so have the ready-made routes to activism and the focus around the union has gone. So electoral turnouts are low in that ward, even by South Yorkshire standards, but I think they're still sharply aware of politics in a general sense, and the experience of the strike is still deeply seared on those who went through it.' During the strike, Healey was a Labour Party activist working for Mind in Hackney, east London. He was elected as an MP in 1997. As a Treasury minister in well-appointed offices in London's St James's Park, he is still keenly aware of the effect the pit closures had on his constituents. 'What nobody anticipated,' Healey says, 'was how deep-rooted and long-lasting some of the problems would be. What the Tories did when they closed the pits was to close down the way the village community used to operate. Rebuilding Brampton is taking longer than many expected, it's more difficult and more complex, but the village is lifting again. I don't want to sound complacent, but I think that over the past six years things have been improving. The harsh reality,' he adds, 'is that the jobs aren't at the end of the street any more.' To address that reality, the generations after the miners have had to look elsewhere for their livelihood. Jim Graham's son, Mick, for example, is now a plasterer. His cousin, Stuart, works in a call centre, while Keith Gayle's son has built up his own web-design business. 'It is a matter of encouraging people to pitch their horizons beyond the confines of the village - and that is particularly true for the next generation. You have to create the opportunities for the next generation, but,' Healey concludes. 'You have to do what you can to deal with the legacy of the older generation.' 'Togetherness,' remembers Brian Wilson, of the strike. It's a refrain often heard in Brampton among the older generation, many of whom, like Wilson, are now retired. The notion of comradeship, of them against us, of standing back to back and watching your mate's back, of the glue that held the community together. 'It divided the community as well,' points out his wife, Anne. 'It changed everything, totally. Before, everybody was all right, everybody helped one another. Although I feel it did a lot for women,' she adds. 'A lot of the women who supported the strike had never gone out to work; they just looked after the family and that were the way the miners wanted it to be. Then suddenly, they came into their own. You see, the women found a voice, they found education and work - and that's something they never lost.' Another thing that has never been lost is a gritty sense of humour. Despite the scars created by the dispute, hindsight provides amusement from both sides. Like the time when the police commander instructed a PC to knock down a snowman on the picket line. The PC demurred but was told to follow orders, which he did and, in the process, wrote off a police van - the snowman had been built around a six-foot concrete bollard. Or the time when Barry Morgan was at Orgreave: 'A miner threw a housebrick at a lorry carrying scabs, but it hit the tyre and bounced straight back and smacked his mate senseless. \"C'mon,\" he said, \"we better get out of here, the bobbies are throwing bricks now.\"' The light is fading by the padlocked gates at the top of what used to be Pit Lane and another, minor, conflict breaks out. 'I wouldn't like to live through that again - it were horrible,' says Anne Wilson. 'I would go through it again,' Brian, her husband, responds. 'Would you? Don't be stupid,' she hectors him. Brian stands his ground, as he did 20 years ago. 'It weren't stupid, everybody were together.' 'How can you say that?' 'It were a thing I wouldn't have missed.' Anne has the last word: 'I would have.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
