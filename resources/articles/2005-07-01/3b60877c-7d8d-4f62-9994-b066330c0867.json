But the current negotiating agenda is overwhelmingly dominated by the concerns and demands of rich countries, not the needs of developing countries, especially in negotiations on industrial tariffs and trade in services. It is business lobby groups like the Association of British Insurers that are behind the push to increase free trade in services. Also, progress for the EU means denying developing countries access to a range of economic policies - such as protecting infant industries - which it successfully used to develop. It is crucial that getting a deal is not seen as being more important than whether the deal is good for the poor. Peter Hardstaff World Development Movement In the wake of crop failure and locust attacks in Niger and neighbouring countries, reports of hungry families eating leaves from trees have highlighted the essential role trees play in times of emergency. This charity has supported the planting of nearly 6 million trees in the Sahel region of Africa. Trees such as the baobab and shea provide families with fuel, food, building materials and even the opportunity to earn money. Though locusts can defoliate a tree, months later, when meagre harvests have run out, trees can still provide fruits, nuts and other foods.
