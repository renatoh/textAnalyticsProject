Commuting stress is the reason a third of 7,500 respondents to a poll by recruitment website reed.co.uk said they would be prepared to spend up to 30 per cent extra for a property if it cut their daily journey. Two out of five said their journey to work was more stressful than it was four years ago and one in 10 had already moved house to make their journey to work easier. Workers in Scotland and south-east England were prepared to pay the most to move house if it reduced the time they spent travelling to and from the office. Is the strain of commuting at the root of an apparent planned mass exodus of Brits to foreign shores? According to another survey this week, by 2020, an extra six million Britons will venture abroad to work or live. A third of Britons are considering moving abroad to work or live, according to a report by the Alliance &amp; Leicester International and think-tank the Centre of Future Studies. The reasons given include searching for a better quality of life (39 per cent), the desire for new experiences (38 per cent) and the pursuit of a new challenge (25 per cent). Simon Hull, managing director of Alliance &amp; Leicester International, says: 'This research suggests a level of dissatisfaction with existing lifestyles such as excessive stress in the workplace which can have a negative impact on personal relationships and happiness.' People taking out mortgages are being urged to buy insurance products they may not need, according to Which? magazine. Only one out of 39 advisers visited by researchers posing as first-time buyers gave 'acceptable advice, asking enough questions and making the right recommendation'. The other advisers in banks, building societies and estate agents were 'a poor show'. Nearly two-thirds 'recommended life insurance that wasn't needed (the researchers had enough)'. Critical illness cover was also routinely mis-sold. 'Only three of the 25 who recommended critical illness insurance explained what was and wasn't covered; and of 30 advisers who recommended cover, only 11 worked out how much their client could afford.' Although the Financial Services Authority will start policing this type of advice from January, Which? is concerned that their efforts will not be enough to prevent mis-selling. Advisers get commissions 'typically worth hundreds of pounds', according to Which?, for selling critical illness, life cover and income protection products. Of those homeowners prepared to tough it out in the UK, some are looking to improve the quality of their lives by installing everything from swimming pools and spa baths to bomb shelters (below) and bars in their homes. While standard home improvements such as double-glazing and new kitchens still show strongly in homeowners' wish lists, 11 per cent of us would like a bomb shelter in our homes. Seventy per cent of those surveyed by Abbey want a spa bath, hot tub or sauna, about a third (31 per cent) want a snooker room and 30 per cent want a bar. Angus Porter, Abbey customer director, says: 'Our average loan for home improvements is in the region of \u00a320,000 and the most popular improvements being carried out are adding a conservatory, converting the loft, or building an extension. These improvements are also the best way of increasing the value of your home, compared with cosmetic improvements such as a landscaped garden or swimming pool, which may increase the desirability of the property, but are unlikely to ever recoup the investment made.' Boom time in the housing market in the north looks set to continue with buy-to-let landlords increasingly setting their sights on northerly regions. A web survey of 600 landlords by the organiser of the Property Investor Show North showed that while 63 per cent of those polled are based in the south of England, 62 per cent believe the next buy-to-let hot spots are in the north, particularly in and around Manchester and Liverpool. Spokesman Nick Clark says: 'It is well known that the majority of landlords have traditionally resided in the south of England, but the tide looks set to turn with almost two-thirds expecting future investment hot spots to be in the north.'
