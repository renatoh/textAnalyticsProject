Authorities said the victims included tourists from Mexico and Switzerland. Police sources told the Guardian that three of those stabbed were Mexican and one was Swiss. The others included two Jordanian police officers, a tour guide and a driver. A Mexican tourist and a Jordanian tour guide were flown to Amman with serious injuries but their conditions were soon upgraded to stable, the Jordanian health minister, Saad Jaber, told reporters. The rest had injuries \u201cbetween moderate and slight,\u201d he said. The perpetrator, a 22-year old, was arrested at the scene and was believed to have acted alone, sources said. He came from a nearby Palestinian refugee camp housing about 35,000 people and used to wash cars at a station on its borders, said Basheer Abu Serdanah, a resident of the camp who knew the man. \u201cIf he did it, we are all in shock,\u201d Serdanah said. \u201cHe was a shy, normal guy. If you talked to him he\u2019d put his eyes to the ground.\u201d A group representing residents of the camp released a statement on Wednesday saying they \u201cdenounce and condemn the terrorist act carried out of by one of these cowards in Jerash.\u201d Natalie, an American tourist who witnessed the attack, said she and her tour group were close to the Roman city\u2019s hippodrome shortly before 11.16am local time when they saw a large group and heard a commotion. She said that they realised there were people bleeding: \u201cIt looked like there had been a full-on fight. And then I saw this guy\u2019s hand just split open and I knew somebody had stabbed people.\u201d She said local guides told her and her group that the attack had been carried out by \u201ca psycho\u201d who had been arrested and that the rest of the site was now safe. \u201cWe walked a bit farther down towards the columns and there was a machete lying there,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were no police lines set up or anything at the site. People were just walking around and you could walk straight through all the blood.\u201d She said she counted at least four victims and said three of them appeared to be severely injured. A video purported to have been shot in the aftermath of the stabbings showed a woman lying face-first on the ground while others pressed a scarf to an apparent wound in her back. An alarmed woman was heard calling for assistance in Spanish, shouting: \u201cThere\u2019s been a stabbing. They\u2019ve got a knife! Please help him here! Please!\u201d Another man sat nearby with a bloodied leg, and bloodstains covered the ground around them. Jerash is home to one of the world\u2019s best-preserved Roman cities and is a major attraction for tourists who are a lifeline for the Jordanian economy. Tourism contributes about 10% of Jordan\u2019s GDP. Visitors significantly declined after the outbreak of the civil war in neighbouring Syria and with the resumption of conflict in Iraq, but has recovered in the past three years. The kingdom is politically stable and has a low crime rate but contributed one of the highest shares per capita of fighters to Isis, with a surge in terrorist incidents recorded since 2015. Among the most deadliest was a shooting spree by Isis militants in the town of Karak in December 2016 that killed a dozen people including a Canadian tourist. The attack ended with a siege inside a Crusader castle in the area. Sam Jones in Madrid contributed to this report"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
