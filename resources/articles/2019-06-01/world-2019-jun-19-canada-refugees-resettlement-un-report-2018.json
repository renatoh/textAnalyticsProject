Canada resettled 28,100 refugees in 2018, overtaking the US for the first time since the 1980 Refugee Act, said the report from the UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) on Wednesday. In contrast, the US \u2013 which has a population nearly 10 times that of Canada \u2013 took in 23,000 refugees \u2013 a dramatic reduction from a recent high of 97,000 in 2016. \u201cThe sharp drop in US refugee resettlement is in part due to the Trump administration\u2019s decision to set a considerably lower cap on the number of refugees allowed into the US than in previous years,\u201d said a report from the Pew Research Center on the decline, adding the president determines refugee caps. Canada also leads in per-capita rates, resettling 756 refugees per million residents. Other countries, including Australia (510), Sweden (493) and Norway (465) also had relatively high resettlement rates. The US settled 70 refugees per million residents. Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has made the resettlement of Syrian refugees a priority for the country, publicly welcoming families at the airport in 2016. Last year, more than 18,000 refugees became Canadian citizens. While Canada led all other countries, it has also decreased its resettlement rate from a 2016 high of 47,000 refugees. Refugee resettlement globally dipped in 2018 to 92,000 people, down from 103,000 in 2017 and a further drop from 189,000 in 2016. The UNHCR reported on Wednesday that more than 70 million people have fled conflict and persecution: the highest number since the second world war. Most of those displaced come from the Middle East and are casualties of the Syrian civil war. UNHCR\u2019s representative in Canada praised the country\u2019s effort so far \u2013 but called for more action. \u201cIt is time for us to recognize what these refugees bring to Canada, culturally and economically: they make us a stronger and more prosperous society,\u201d said Jean-Nicolas Beuze in a statement. \u201cThe Canadian experience shows that welcoming refugees is a win-win. This undoubtedly provides an antidote to the too-often toxic and misleading narratives against displaced people we are hearing globally, and in Canada.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
