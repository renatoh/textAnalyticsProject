This was classic stuff, straight from the manual of the recovering addict, step nine of the 12-step programme: \"Make direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.\" By that narrowly defined standard, the 14-minute statement made by the world's most famously fallen athlete to a few friends and business associates in Florida, and a few hundred million members of the public watching around the world on television, must surely be judged as a success. Cheated. Irresponsible. Unfaithful. Wrong-doings. Atone. These were all the right words and they were spoken in sombre tone, like a man who was delivering the eulogy at his own funeral. \u2022 Woods rules out immediate return to golf \u2022 Tiger Woods's statement: the full transcript \u2022 Experts give their view on the confession \u2022 Scott Murray's minute-by-minute coverage Of course, that was the intention \u2013 to bury the old Tiger Woods and allow a new one to be born. Did he and his highly paid media advisers and script writers succeed in fulfilling that wider ambition? The people who matter most to Woods and who have been most damaged by his behaviour, his wife Elin and their two children, will presumably give their judgment in due course but his mother, Tida, had no doubts at all. \"I am so proud of you. Never think you stand alone. Mom will always be there for you and I love you,'' she said afterwards, as she hugged her son. Tim Finchem, the commissioner of the PGA Tour, whose organisation is so dependent on Woods' presence for its success, was just as supportive, even though he had every right to be angry with a man who had heaped such embarrassment on the game. \"He is an American hero,\" he said of Woods. \"At the end of the day he is a human being and makes mistakes. We all make mistakes. We learn from those mistakes and we learn to be better people.\" Others will not be so ready to move on, and for this Woods, and his advisers, have only themselves to blame. The choice of yesterday's setting, and conditions imposed on those invited to report on it (limited numbers, no questions) was guaranteed to inflame. The Golf Writers Association of America, a body not previously known for possessing tungsten vertebrae, decided to boycott the event. Woods, who has lost a losing battle through the years to hide his contempt for the breed, appeared indifferent to the snub, even though it delivered a damaging blow to the credibility of yesterday's occasion. The casual observer may have been happy to accept Woods' 12-word dismissal of the claims that he \"used performance-enhancing drugs\" but anyone who has been paying attention during this scandal appreciates that this brief and angry rebuttal comes nowhere close to answering all the issues arising from his relationship with a Toronto-based doctor, Anthony Galea, who has been charged with importing banned drugs into Canada and who treated the world No1 during his recovery from knee surgery. Nor should his assertion that he kept a distance between his family and his sponsorship activities be allowed to pass unchallenged. This, frankly, was untrue. Woods' image as a \"family man\", was to be trawled out whenever it was commercially expedient, as it was in Australia just days before the edifice began to crumble. \"Does family come first?'' he was asked. \"Always,\" he replied. And what of his colleagues in professional golf, the likes of Ernie Els, who this week described Woods' decision to stage yesterday's event during the week of the Accenture World Matchplay as \"selfish\"? There was scarcely a nod towards those comments yesterday. Instead Woods chose to use his platform to rail at length against the intrusions of the \"tabloid press\", whom he accused of hounding his family, and against those who had \"made up\" stories that his wife had attacked him on the night of his now infamous car crash. \"There has never been an episode of domestic violence in our marriage. Never,\" he said. It is hard not to sympathise with him on this \u2013 the allegations against Elin Nordegren have always been without foundations \u2013 but, equally, it was difficult to miss the barely restrained anger in his voice at these particular moments and ask if he will be able to find peace with the world that awaits him on his return. As for when that return will be, he was vague, perhaps because he himself does not yet know or perhaps because he is seeking to retain just a sliver of that which he once coveted most and has now lost: control. \"I do plan to return to golf one day, I just don't know when that day will be. I don't rule out that it will be this year,\" he said quietly. In other words, it might be Bay Hill, it might not be. It might be the Masters or not. St Andrews here I come, then again maybe not. In other words, this is still Tiger's world and the rest of us just live in it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
