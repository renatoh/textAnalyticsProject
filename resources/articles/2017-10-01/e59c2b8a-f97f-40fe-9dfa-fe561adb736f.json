Please do not add spoilers from later episodes. Each week in the Deuce we watch Candy put on her makeup. It has become a recurring motif. Sitting in the sanctuary of her small but comfortable apartment, she applies the second skin she wears to walk the streets, as we look on. As she concentrates we try to work out what she\u2019s thinking. Even in the good moments, our conclusions are rarely heartening. This week we watch Candy painstakingly covering the results of an awful assault. A \u201cclient\u201d beat her so badly she had to report herself to a hospital emergency room. But we do not see her convalesce. The next time she is on screen, Candy is covering her cuts and bruises, and we can tell that she has done this before. What we don\u2019t know is why she puts herself through it. She needs the money, yes, but there\u2019s also something else. The pimp Rodney has deduced this point. In his latest attempt to persuade Candy to work for him, Rodney starts with the usual noises \u2013 \u201cYou and me? Out here I\u2019m talking world famous, baby\u201d \u2013 but before long, he zooms in on her wounds. He recalls the other times she has been beaten in lengthy detail and wonders why she puts herself through it. Why is she even on the street in the first place? Something must have driven her there, he says: \u201cDid Daddy pass you round his work buddies?\u201d Candy says nothing in response. Crying, she walks away down 42nd street. In the episode\u2019s penultimate scene, we see Candy again. She is back with the porn director who doesn\u2019t put film in his camera. He says yes, they can work together, and actually he\u2019s found a loophole in state law that might mean they could start doing things a little differently. But the director has seen through the makeup, too. You will need two weeks before you\u2019re camera ready, he says. Candy smiles, but you can tell it hurts. It can be hard to watch the continual degradation of Candy, the freest, wildest spirit on the Deuce. Even if she\u2019s not entirely likable, you root for her. You want her to improve her life and escape the straits she is in. Through her we see how hard life is on the street. But we see things from other perspectives, too. Like that of Rochelle, the girl Darlene brought from North Carolina on a promise of becoming a model. In this episode, the 16-year-old Rochelle is not only dumped in the most dangerous part of a very dangerous city, she is given to a pimp who then sells her to another without her knowledge, never mind her consent. Yet Rochelle seems curiously unperturbed by all of it. The one thing she is sure of, Rochelle tells Darlene, is that she is not going back on the bus. Even when she asks the street girls how bad it can get should a girl fail to pay her pimp, her enquiry is seemingly made less out of fear than a desire to get the facts straight. Is she naive or fatalistic? Expecting the worst in life and how it might affect the way you live is one of the interesting considerations thrown up by the Deuce. Rochelle might be someone who thinks like this, and maybe Darlene, too. Abby, meanwhile, is not. The white, upper-middle-class girl is determined to be part of the seedy world of midtown Manhattan, but only on her terms. So when Darlene turns out to have accepted Abby\u2019s act of largesse, a bus ticket home, and used it to recruit more girls for Larry the pimp, Abby is incandescent. This is not the way she expected to be treated \u2013 it was not the right thing to do. Darlene, for her part, looks momentarily shocked when confronted but quickly returns to normal. What did Abby expect? Abby also gets pulled up short by Vince who points out that, actually, she should be wearing a leotard like every other woman who works at the Hi-Hat. Vince is upset because Abby brought her student boyfriend into the bar. He thought that Abby was infatuated with him. Abby, meanwhile, thought similar of Vince, that he was an enamoured benefactor. Both have had their fantasies dispelled. Otherwise, Vince has a quiet week, accepting Richie Pipilo\u2019s invitation to run a \u201cmassage parlour\u201d on the mob\u2019s behalf after brother-in-law Bobby nominates himself to manage it. For some reason, I am not sure that irascible union man Bobby is the best person to be gladhanding mobsters and their by-the-hour molls. Call it a gut feeling. Notes and queries We finally get to enter New York\u2019s nascent gay scene this week as we accompany Paul on a drug-fuelled night out. A man who seems somehow to have retained an innocence despite living most of his life in secret, he has a fine time in a room filled with colourful balloons, picks up a handsome young man and brings him home. Paul\u2019s strait-laced lawyer housemate is woken up in the process. No matter, a couple becomes a threesome and everyone is happy. For now at least. Abby\u2019s student mates take a poll on whether to go watch Clint Eastwood in Play Misty for Me or Dustin Hoffman in Straw Dogs. They choose Clint, and I second that choice. What about you? Officer Chris Ralston is working the hard yards in his attempt to make crusading journalist Sandra fall for him. He\u2019s persuaded the pimp Reggie Love to allow her to interview him (at $40 a pop). He\u2019s also still sceptical about the relation between the city and the mob. As is Sandra to be fair. Maybe they will bond over that. Reggie Love: \u201cThe first rule of pimping is to look a man in the eye when you\u2019re talking to him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
