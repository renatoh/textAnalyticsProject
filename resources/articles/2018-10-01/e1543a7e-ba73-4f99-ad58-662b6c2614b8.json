I haven\u2019t done anything to scare them\u2019", "bodyText": "Throughout the long and golden arc of Mo Farah\u2019s track career, when Olympic and world titles were hoarded like trinkets, he had a simple but brutal philosophy: to own the start line. That meant knowing he was the fastest athlete in the field. That he was the strongest. And, if it came to it, knowing he could beat up any of his rivals. So when he steps on to the start line at the Chicago marathon on Sunday, Farah intends to make people fear him again. \u201cIt is similar to a fight,\u201d says the 10-times Olympic and world champion. \u201cYou need to know people\u2019s weaknesses and strengths so, like a fight, you know what to do. I haven\u2019t done anything to scare them yet. I haven\u2019t gone out in a marathon and controlled a race, playing around with it. But I am in a good place and I am patient.\u201d So patient that for the first time Farah says he will definitely run in the 2020 Olympics. \u201cOne hundred per cent,\u201d he says. \u201cAs long as my body can hold up I am definitely going to Tokyo. I know from my training I am definitely capable of getting a medal. And that\u2019s why Sunday will be a key test. I am eighth fastest here. But the guys are not Eliud Kipchoge or Kenenisa Bekele. I should be able to mix with them.\u201d And then some. Farah has asked for pacers to take him round in 62 minutes as he targets the European record of 2:05:48 held by Sondre Nordstad Moen. He should get it too provided the forecast high winds in the windy city stay away. \u201cI am in decent shape and I believe the European record is definitely in with a shout,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if it is raining it is still on. The rain isn\u2019t a problem but the wind could be. If we haven\u2019t got the wind against us most of the way it is possible.\u201d However he admits Kipchoge, who set a world record of 2:01:39 last month in Berlin, remains a different animal over 26.2 miles. \u201cHe\u2019s run 2:01. I\u2019ve run 2:06. You calculate it? Eliud is different, isn\u2019t he?\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cI was watching that performance and I was thinking \u2018bloody hell\u2019. It was impressive. At the time I was thinking, you need to get past 30km because that is when shit happens in a marathon. \u201cYou could be looking all right. You could be feeling awesome but you often pay the price. I thought he might get some lactic but he was fine and it was quite even pace. I have had lactic in London, where I went out ridiculously crazy and felt comfortable until later on when I felt \u2018oh, shit\u2019. Then when Eliud picked up the pace and I had no response. That was a crazy way to run the race.\u201d This time there is no Kipchoge but everywhere Farah looks there are unknown dangers \u2013 in particular from the Ethiopian 20-somethings, Mosinet Geremew and Birhanu Legese, who both ran 2:04 in Dubai this year, and the 25-year-old world champion Geoffrey Kirui. Then there is Farah\u2019s former friend and training partner Galen Rupp, the defending champion, who believes he is in shape to lower Khalid Khannouchi\u2019s American record of 2:05:38, which has stood for 16 years. \u201cTraining has gone great,\u201d Rupp says. \u201cThis is probably the best situation I\u2019ve ever been in to run fast.\u201d He has warm words for Farah too, calling him \u201cone of the best track runners of all time\u201d. Yet it is not only Rupp and the elite field that Farah is going up against but his former coach and mentor, Alberto Salazar, who transformed him from an 28-year-old athlete knocking on the door of being world class to someone sat proudly at the highest table of the sport. It was under Salazar\u2019s watch that Farah won four Olympic gold medals and six world titles at 5,000m and 10,000m from 2011 to 2017. But while the American has been hailed as a \u201cgenius\u201d by UK Athletics\u2019 performance director Neil Black, he is also a polarising figure who remains under investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency following several allegations of breaching the rules. They included giving Rupp the banned drug testosterone when he was 16 and infusing his athletes with more than the permitted levels of the amino acid L-carnitine. A leaked Usada report also accused Salazar of a \u201cquixotic and dangerous search for better performances in a bottle or a pill\u201d and suggested he \u201csought an advantage ethical coaches did not have and would never obtain\u201d. Salazar has always vigorously denied any wrongdoing, calling allegations against him \u201cinnuendo, hearsay and rumour\u201d. Farah has always insisted he is a \u201cclean athlete who has never broken the rules\u201d. Inevitably, though, he was drawn into the whirlpool of allegations \u2013 frequently having to defend his decision to remain with Salazar until leaving him last year. Farah insists he is happy with his new coach, Gary Lough, and ready to make the step up in his third marathon. \u201cI still have a lot to learn and a big part of this race is being smart and confident and that could be the key,\u201d he said. \u201cAs you know from my track career, it has taken me 10 years to mix with the guys and do what I do and win races. It is the same with the marathon. This race is exciting, I am in great shape, so we will see what happens.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 8 October 2018.
