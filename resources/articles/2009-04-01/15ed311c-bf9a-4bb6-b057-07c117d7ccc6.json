Hard to beat, one might think. Perhaps, as broadcast on Radio 3, those rewards were felt more by listeners at home. In the abbey itself, however, even allowing for the echoing acoustic and the matchless setting - it's not often one can visit the composer's tomb during the interval - something was missing. Judged by the exceptional standards of recent London performances of Messiah under Stephen Layton or Harry Christophers, it was a disappointment. At first, the missing something seemed to be James O'Donnell's cautious, sometimes dragging tempi in the early numbers, too slow in the overture, then spun out slower still in Comfort Ye. Yet from Behold the Lamb of God at the start of the second part of the oratorio, he found a surer sense of Messiah's development. The handling of the Hallelujah chorus lacked theatricality, but Worthy Is the Lamb and the Amen chorus had all the richness of texture and celebratory emphasis one could wish for. Vocally, this Messiah was something of a curate's egg, too. It was interesting to hear the abbey's fine boy trebles in the choruses, but the experience failed to make the case for preferring them in general to adult sopranos, especially since O'Donnell opted for the ripe sound of Ailish Tynan in the soprano solos and preferred Sarah Connolly's ravishing mezzo over the now almost standard countertenor. The male soloists raised fewer questions, with Paul Agnew arresting and eloquent in the tenor numbers and Jonathan Lemalu, though rough-toned at times, bringing some much-needed spirit and attack to the proceedings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
