I repotted it, fed it with citrus feed and was careful not to let it dry out, but all the limes fell off and the leaves became lighter in colour. Can I prevent this from happening next time it flowers? Fruit drop in citrus plants happens most often as a result of a significant change in temperature, most likely from warm to cold, but also the other way around - for instance, when you bring a plant into a heated house at the end of summer after having it outside. As the problem occurred soon after you bought your lime, the chances are the temperature change from nursery to garden centre to home was not as smooth as the plant would have wished. Perhaps it got cold being carried from the heated garden centre to your house. Some unscrupulous nurseries are naughty and grow plants 'soft', which means giving them especially warm temperatures to make them grow quickly and be ready for sale sooner, or fetch a higher price. Growers know that gardeners cannot produce the same conditions at home and that plants will suffer, but they still do it. If you think this is the case, speak to the garden centre. To encourage a new flush of flowers, give the plant as much direct sunlight as possible in spring and summer, even moving it outdoors as soon as you're sure it's warm enough for it not to get a further shock. How to get a taller hedge I'd like to increase my 4ft privet hedge by 12-18in. Do I just let it grow naturally or will that create gaps and make it look straggly? It will look straggly at first, but won't take long to catch up. Let the top grow this year, but cut the sides. Next spring, cut new growth back to a third of the desired height. This will promote bushy growth lower down. Next summer, cut back twice to just below its final height. Cut back two or three times a year; it will thicken up to look like the rest. \u00b7 Send your gardening queries to space@theguardian.com Plant it now Sorry to put a downer on things just as spring is finally springing, but chances are there will be more than a few wet days this summer. A banana is the ultimate wet-weather plant. Drops of rain patter on to its huge leaves and form into silvery balls that run down and collect in the centre of the plant, and the vibrant green looks even lusher in low light. After a few years, the plants reach an impressive 2.5m in height. Be transported from soggy Nuneaton to tropical monsoon Thailand. You can grow banana plants in a border or in pots, then lift and bring them into a cool, light spot indoors for winter. In warmer areas, after a few years you can overwinter them outdoors under layers of hessian and a waterproof cover, but the dwarf variety on offer here will always do better overwintered indoors."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
