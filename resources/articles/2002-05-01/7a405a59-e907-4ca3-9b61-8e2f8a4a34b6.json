The new fares apply to bookings made at least 21 days in advance and cover 22 destinations, including popular tourist spots such as Barbados, Orlando and Mauritius. On all other long- haul routes flights must be booked 42 days in advance to qualify for the new Club World fares. No changes or refunds are permitted on the new fares once the booking has been made. A return flight in Club World now starts from \u00a31,467 to Dubai, saving \u00a3446 on the current lowest available fare. A Club World fare to Tampa starts from \u00a31,975 return, saving \u00a31,201 and to the Seychelles from \u00a32,202 return, saving \u00a3357. One of the biggest savings is on fares to Los Angeles where a Club World ticket now leads in at \u00a31,936, based on travel in November, a saving of \u00a32,343. British Airways Club World features seats which convert into 6ft flat beds while First Class features individual cabins with flat beds. A spokeswoman for BA said: 'We are getting feedback from our tour operator partners that more people are willing to pay extra for leg room and a bit more luxury.' The First Class fares start from \u00a33,402 return to Barbados, saving \u00a3847 on the current lowest fare."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
