But there is no Wheels on the Bus, no Wind the Bobbin Up. Instead, the women work their way through folk songs, lullabies and gospel, switching from Spanish to Hebrew to Igbo and Zulu and deftly following the group\u2019s leader as she introduces rounds and three-part harmonies. This is a singing class designed not to entertain the babies \u2013 though they are perfectly happy as they chew on miniature maracas \u2013 but for the women themselves. Melodies for Mums, run by the not-for-profit social enterprise Breathe Arts Health Research, aims to help new mothers with postnatal depression (PND), or those at risk of it, combat their symptoms by singing songs specially chosen to improve confidence and help them bond with their babies. No musical experience is necessary. Since the programme began two years ago in Southwark, south-east London, 150 women have taken part. Now it is being expanded to reach hundreds more, as the sessions become part of a big study \u2013 funded by a \u00a32m grant from the Wellcome Trust \u2013 into how arts interventions boost physical and mental health, and how they could be scaled up to become NHS treatments \u201cOur long-term hope is that we can roll this out as a national programme that would be commissioned by the NHS as a new clinical service, so it\u2019s not just seen as a nice, arty project that some mums might do, but as something underpinned by research showing it\u2019s a very effective clinical treatment,\u201d explains Yvonne Farquharson, Breathe\u2019s managing director. That could mean some women with PND wouldn\u2019t need to use other NHS services, saving it money in the long term, she says. Earlier research, which inspired the Breathe programme, found that mothers with moderate to severe symptoms of PND who did group singing saw a significantly faster improvement in their symptoms than a control group. The new study will test the impact and mechanisms involved further, with academics measuring women\u2019s levels of the stress hormone cortisol and the \u201clove hormone\u201d oxytocin to assess bonding with their babies, and evaluating levels of depression, anxiety, coping, loneliness and social support. While some participants have a formal diagnosis of PND, others have milder symptoms. \u201cThey are finding it a struggle to cope,\u201d says the project manager, Tim Osborn. Nine weeks into the current course, the women who speak about their experiences don\u2019t describe themselves as being depressed. But for Bekki, whose son Henry had open heart surgery at 11 days old and spent five weeks in hospital, the sessions have been part of her recovery from that trauma, helping her build a bond she felt she had missed out on. \u201cHe was cared for by a lot of people in those early weeks and I felt like he didn\u2019t necessarily need me,\u201d she says. \u201c[Here] it\u2019s just me and him. It\u2019s like a little escape.\u201d She appreciates the way the singing is for the women, rather than the usual nursery rhymes, and that there\u2019s none of the endless competitiveness of some mum and baby groups. \u201cIt\u2019s like a release of the tension,\u201d she says. Devlin\u2019s daughter Leonora was born weighing just 2.55kg, was not gaining weight and suffered from jaundice. \u201cI was having a lot of anxiety and feeling a lack of control,\u201d she says. Constantly seeing different midwifes who all commented afresh on Leonora\u2019s size only made things worse. \u201cYou\u2019re already feeling really stressed that you\u2019re not doing a good job and then the system is pouring salt in your wounds a little bit,\u201d she says. The singing, she says, helps not just because it gets her out for a walk and into a community, but because it becomes \u201calmost meditative\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019re singing these really silly songs, but you don\u2019t have to talk and say, \u2018what\u2019s your problem, why are you here?\u2019 You just share space.\u201d PND affects one in 10 new mothers, and many more suffer from symptoms like anxiety, low mood and struggling to bond with their babies. But they often find effective support is lacking and their symptoms are missed. About a third of the women Breathe screens who are eligible for Melodies for Mums are not in touch with support services, Osborn says. The new research project, run by Kings\u2019s College London and University College London, will be the world\u2019s largest study into the health impact and scalability of arts interventions. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing growing interest in using the arts for supporting mental and physical health,\u201d says Daisy Fancourt, associate professor of psychobiology and epidemiology at UCL, and one of the leaders of the Melodies for Mums strand (others will look at stroke and Parkinson\u2019s disease). \u201cThere\u2019s a wealth of anthropological and psychological research on the benefits of singing for individual mental health, mother-infant interactions and infant development.\u201d A recent study with older people in Kent found group singing had a significant effect on mental health and quality of life, including reducing anxiety, depression and loneliness. At the children\u2019s centre, Farquharson says the difference in the women is noticeable as the course progresses. \u201cYou start to see a spark in their eyes,\u201d she says. \u201cFriendships blossom, people walk in with their heads held higher.\u201d Hannah, who signed up after struggling with breastfeeding and her son Kit\u2019s sleep, admits she was sceptical about whether singing would make her feel better. \u201cBut actually it really does,\u201d she says, as she prepares to head out into the dark of the late afternoon. \u201cYou really do feel lifted by the end. A bit lighter.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?
