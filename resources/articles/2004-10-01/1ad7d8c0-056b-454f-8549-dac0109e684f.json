Take-up of the triple jab against measles, mumps and rubella in some parts of the capital has slumped so low that fewer than seven in 10 babies are being immunised, raising fears of an epidemic at any time. Computer models used by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) have suggested an epidemic in London could be imminent, with the rest of the country at risk in future. The agency is working with directors of public health in London to increase the number of children being immunised. Young children in primary school are thought to be the most vulnerable to infection. Last year only four in five children in England reaching the age of two received the jab, well below the 92% of 1995-6, before the first controversial and now discredited suggestions that the jab was linked to autism. Health officials have constantly tried to reassure the public so that immunisation levels reach 95%, as recommended by the World Health Organisation. The concerns were reported in the medical newspaper Pulse yesterday. Professor Angus Nicoll, head of communicable disease surveillance at the HPA, said: \"There is a gradually increasing risk of having chains of infection which will lead on to an epidemic.\" The HPA estimated about 300,000 children of primary and pre-school age group in London were now susceptible, although it was impossible to say how many of those might be infected. However, up to 12% of children and one in five adults who catch the disease could end up in hospital. Targeting schools with catch-up immunisations was vital, although there would be no altercations with parents concerned about the jab. Prof Nicoll said: \"No one is going to say 'let's go in and let's immunise all these children in this class, irrespective of parental opinion'. \"But I think one would have to spell out the risk to remind people of what happened in Dublin in 1999-2000 when 111 children were in hospital, 12 in intensive care, seven ventilated and three died.\" Other options such as encouraging parents to keep children at home at the sign of illness would not work. \"Measles is infectious before you see the signs. It could look so much like an ordinary cold you would end up with great swaths of children at home. It is really only immunisation that works,\" Prof Nicoll said. Last year 442 people in England and Wales were confirmed as measles patients, but such figures are notoriously inaccurate because of the way the illness is reported. It was the highest figure in years. Numbers this year so far suggest a significant drop. The Department of Health said coverage of the MMR vaccine had risen in three of the last four quarters. \"However, we do recognise that overall coverage is lower than ideal and this leaves a concerning vulnerability. We encourage parents to vaccinate their children with MMR as the safest form of protection from the disease,\" it said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
