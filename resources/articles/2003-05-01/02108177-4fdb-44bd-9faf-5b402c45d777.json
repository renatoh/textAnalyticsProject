Everything has its own unique pattern made up of different shapes, lines and textures. Some things are easy to identify because the patterns on them are obvious, and some are more difficult to spot. Animals have certain patterns on their bodies for camouflage. Buildings often have patterns in the brick and tile work for decoration. Whatever the reason for patterns, they surround us wherever we go. Have a good look around your house for any interesting and unusual patterns. Take photos or sketch them and see if anyone can identify where they are from."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
