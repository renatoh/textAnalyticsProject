Bernard Laporte's men outscored the Springboks four tries to one, with Jake White's side looking bereft of ideas in the threequarters and brutally exposed at the scrummage. France had far too much ingenuity and pace in the backs and completely controlled the set piece, where they were held back only by an eccentric refereeing display from Australian Stuart Dickinson. The visitors opened the scoring with a try from left-winger Cedric Heymans. Florian Fritz added a drop goal and Dimitri Yachvili a penalty, but South Africa went in at half time 12-11 ahead thanks to four well-struck penalties from Percy Montgomery. The Springboks added two more Montgomery penalties early in the second half and Russell crossed for a try moments later, but France responded immediately with a sublime try from winger Vincent Clerc, who added his second in the 73rd minute when another flowing French move, initiated by the imperious Yannick Jauzion, saw the winger fly over in the corner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
