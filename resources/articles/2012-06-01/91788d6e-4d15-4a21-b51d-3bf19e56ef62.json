Not that that phrase was exactly over-used: there hasn't been much hysteria for years over Desperate Housewives, which curtseys off our TVs tonight. The ladies of Wisteria Lane, Fairview, in fictional Eagle State, are, figuratively at least, being taken behind the barn and hit with an axe, after eight varyingly glorious years. It is the right decision. Not because the show was losing its pizzazz and draw. Although it was. Recent plodding years only served to remind viewers of the fabulous beginnings. Dappled apple trees and \"perfect\" lives riddled with curtain-twitching darknesses, great social humour, heartache, industrial-strength bitchiness and, at their best, plotlines that somehow managed to marry Twin Peaks to The Simpsons, and Marcia Cross as the ever-magnificent Bree. At its height, it was watched by more than 70 million worldwide. But it's correctly being excised after eight years because, increasingly, a set-template drama simply cannot last longer than that span today. It was a perfect refraction, for a while, of mid-Noughties affluent head-in-sand smalltown America, as was The Wire of post-9/11 Baltimore. The awkward truth for dramatists is that, quite bizarrely and generally unforeseen, technology is altering our social outlooks, even our social skills, and not just by the year but by the month. The assumption of privacy, of home life as castle, tacitly adopted by Bree, Susan, Lynette and Gaby, and their decisions to choose when and with whom to spill secrets, is being made to look antediluvian by the rising, currently victorious, generations of compulsive sharers. Smack-on just-so contemporary social drama used to \u2013 once the characters were finely established, quirks flagged, mood painted \u2013 sit happily bubbling on the pan for a good two years before even a twitch of contemporaneous updating was necessary. Today, dramatists must not only invent and entice and storytell to the best of their abilities; they must take account of the net's accidental ability utterly to re-engineer social interactions, and its many laws of unforeseen consequences. Human drama used to be enough. One day, maybe even one day soon, it will be enough again. For the moment, however \u2013 it must be the worst of times for those who just want to tell a story, the best of times for those gifted with the ability to see round the next corner \u2013 of-the-moment social drama is going to have to take account of technology's quite unprecedented ability to alter our ways of life. It's impossible to imagine, say, a believable political drama coming out this autumn that eschews ferocious use of Twitter; anything scheduled for spring that doesn't foreguess the next big \"phone thing\". (Personally, I think a perfect contemporary drama would highlight the quiet, fraught, human, ongoing battle between those who want to live life and those who want to live life electronically. But that's just me.) But who'd be a TV dramatist now? And is this a triumphant hurrah for science, finally trumping arts in changing society? Discuss, over a green tea, albeit with a gin bottle nearby, with the feisty, unforgotten ladies of Wisteria Lane."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
