Julie Lowe has been replaced on an interim basis by a senior executive from another London hospital in the wake of a scathing report by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) into multiple patient safety failings at the North Middlesex. The NHS care regulator\u2019s inspectors found that shortages of doctors and nurses in A&amp;E were so acute, and the unit so busy, that untrained receptionists there ended up judging which patients needed medical attention first. It is one of the busiest A&amp;Es in the capital, treating 500 patients a day. \u201cWalk-in patients were seen by a receptionist, who decided if they were suitable for the urgent care centre or, with a more serious condition, needed to go to the main emergency department,\u201d according to the CQC\u2019s report, which rated care in the A&amp;E unit overall as \u201cinadequate\u201d. \u201cIncreasing delays in time to triage [A&amp;E patients by a nurse] can mean that it is up to two hours before a patient is seen by a nurse, where the national standard is 15 minutes, during which time their undetected condition could deteriorate. We were given several recent examples of where this had happened,\u201d the CQC said. \u201cMany patients who arrived in the emergency department were not being seen by a clinician within 15 minutes and this meant that they were at risk of deteriorating and experiencing poor outcomes. Many patients were waiting too long to see a doctor and this meant they were at risk of deteriorating or not receiving prompt diagnosis and treatment.\u201d The report also revealed that: Middle-grade doctors on duty in the A&amp;E unit overnight were endangering patients\u2019 safety because \u201cmany ... were unable or unwilling to make decisions about patients\u2019 diagnosis and treatment\u201d. Junior doctors were left in charge of the A&amp;E unit, which serves a catchment area of 350,000 residents, despite their inexperience. The trust twice denied that had ever happened when the Guardian first revealed it last month. Staff\u2019s failure to undertake hourly rounds meant \u201cthat a patient had lain dead for up to four and a half hours before being found\u201d. Chronic staff shortages were implicated in one patient dying unexpectedly. Their death occurred when the A&amp;E was \u201ctwo to three nurses and one middle grade doctor short\u201d, an internal serious incident investigation by the trust found. Vital equipment, including a portable resuscitation trolley, was often missing or broken and so unavailable. The trust maintained that Lowe was \u201con leave\u201d. But NHS sources confirmed that she has stepped down after national NHS bodies and regulators which are trying to help the hospital lost confidence in her ability to turn its fortunes around. Libby McManus, from the nearby Royal Free hospital, which is now likely to take over the North Middlesex, has become the latter\u2019s interim chief executive. The Guardian disclosed last month that the General Medical Council and Health Education England were so concerned about the situation in the hospital\u2019s emergency department that they had threatened to close it down by stopping all doctors in training from working there because training and supervision of them by consultants was so poor. The Labour MP and former health minister David Lammy, whose Tottenham constituents use the hospital regularly, said: \u201cThis a truly damning CQC report that has been sat on for months, and frankly it\u2019s even worse than I feared. \u201cNot only has the emergency department been left in the care of junior doctors, but it now emerges that all patients arriving by ambulance were assessed and treated by nurses without any input from a doctor at all.\u201d He accused the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and national NHS bodies of covering up what he said was the \u201cscandal\u201d of poor care at the hospital in Edmonton, north-east London. \u201cNorth Middlesex University hospital is one of the busiest A&amp;E departments in London, so it is worrying that we found that there were not enough experienced doctors on call to deal with demand,\u201d said Professor Sir Mike Richards, the CQC\u2019s chief inspector of hospitals. The CQC undertook its original unannounced inspection of the A&amp;E and medical units in April and May, and visited the emergency department again last week. \u201cWe have already seen some progress since that original inspection. A new leadership team is in place in the emergency department [and] there are moves to appoint more senior doctors.\u201d The North Middlesex has borrowed five A&amp;E specialists from nearby hospitals to help it improve staffing levels. \u201cThe evidence from our latest inspection is that North Middlesex\u2019s emergency department has turned a corner, but there is still much more that needs to be done,\u201d added Richards. Inspectors will return to assess the whole hospital in September."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
