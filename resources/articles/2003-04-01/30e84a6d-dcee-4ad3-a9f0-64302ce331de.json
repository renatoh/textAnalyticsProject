The goals include teaching the majority of English-language classes at middle and high schools in English and to send 10,000 high school students overseas as exchange students annually by 2008. Meanwhile a language school in Osaka has developed an English course based on rakugo, traditional Japanese comedy routines, according to the Nikkei Weekly. Kaishi Katsura, a rakugo performer who is developing the course for EEC school said, \"Rakugo, in which we listen with our ears and imitate with our mouths, is similar to foreign-language study.\" Innovation winners The winners of the British Council's UK ELT Innovation Awards were announced last month. The three joint prizes went to Warwick University's Listening To Lectures CD-Rom, aimed at helping foreign students prepare for the varied style of delivery of British academics, and featuring lecturer and author Germaine Greer.
