Five women pushing dance forward", "bodyText": "Ruth Brill A Peter and the Wolf where Peter is a girl, the animals dress in streetwear and the pastoral setting becomes an urban playground: this is the world according to Ruth Brill. The 30-year-old has just made her second main-stage work for Birmingham Royal Ballet, the company she has danced with since 2012, and is now retiring as a dancer to concentrate on choreography. Brill\u2019s work has a sense of fun, fantasy and solid classical grounding. Her last piece, Arcadia, had nymphs and gods cavorting in the woods. In Peter and the Wolf \u2013 Prokofiev\u2019s much-loved children\u2019s piece, narrated here by poet Hollie McNish \u2013 the duck may be a hormonal teen in headphones, and the dancers wearing a mix of pointe shoes and trainers, but the steps are still steeped in classical tradition, just with character-driven inflections, diversions and quirks. Seeking to connect with her audience, Brill has made dance for the Rugby World Cup and Birmingham flash mobs. Her next projects include working with London Children\u2019s Ballet, New English Ballet Theatre and National Youth Ballet. \u201cNow is when my generation needs to step up and prepare to become the next wave of leaders,\u201d Brill said recently. \u201cWe have different life experiences, different stories to tell. And it\u2019s time to push ourselves forward to inherit roles from the generation before us.\u201d Peter and the Wolf is part of Birmingham Royal Ballet\u2019s [Un]leashed, at Birmingham Hippodrome until 15 June; at Sadler\u2019s Wells, London, 25-26 June. Charlotte Edmonds With her bleach-blond bob, Charlotte Edmonds looks the epitome of cool, and you could say the same about the 22-year-old\u2019s dance. Plucked out of the Rambert school to become the Royal Ballet\u2019s first Young Choreographer, Edmonds impressed everyone during a three-year association with Covent Garden, where she was mentored by Wayne McGregor, made choreography for Selfridges, a film for the National Gallery and a ballet with basketball that was inspired by the legendary choreographer Kenneth MacMillan. Since going freelance, she\u2019s made an underwater ballet about depression, featuring ballerina Francesca Hayward, and is keen to work more in digital platforms. She is doing post-production on a film she has directed about plastic pollution, is making a documentary series about dyslexia (a condition she has herself) and is working on a ballet about the climate crisis. These might be serious subjects, but Edmonds is more and more drawn to fizzy, pop-culture-inspired choreography, closing the gap between the ballet stage and the dancefloor, such as a funky solo she made for the Royal Ballet\u2019s Joseph Sissens and a new piece set to the music of Hot Chip. A go-to choreographer for big ballet companies looking to make relevant work for their younger dancers, Edmonds has no fewer than three different works being performed at the forthcoming Young Talent festival, by the junior companies of Dutch National Ballet and Norwegian National Ballet, and the Rambert school. The Young Talent festival is at Linbury theatre, Royal Opera House, London, 18 June-6 July. Stina Quagebeur Belgian dancer Stina Quagebeur has been choreographing since she was inspired as a child by the ballets of Mats Ek and Maurice B\u00e9jart. She\u2019s kept it up as a sideline throughout her career as a dancer with English National Ballet. At 34, she is making her mark as a dance-maker with a strong sense of her own voice. ENB director Tamara Rojo has put her faith in Quagebeur and gave her a main stage debut as part of the company\u2019s She Persisted show, highlighting female choreographers. In Nora, based on Ibsen\u2019s A Doll\u2019s House, Quagebeur showed her interest in emotionally driven narrative, and stripped-back literary adaptations \u2013 a territory pretty much owned by Cathy Marston at the moment. She created surging, spinning and circling movement, with the performers\u2019 feet just skimming the floor, using a group of dancers as a chorus to amplify Nora\u2019s thoughts and emotional state. This is a choreographer interested in her characters\u2019 psychology. Previous themes have included Edward Hopper\u2019s love-hate marriage (A Room in New York), Vera Brittain\u2019s Testament of Youth (Vera) and Philip Larkin\u2019s poetry (Domna). A keen theatregoer, who particularly admires director Emma Rice, Quagebeur is interested in reimagining stories and the ways you might tell them. We\u2019ll be watching her next moves with interest. Sophie Laplane Another dancer turned choreographer nurtured within a company\u2019s ranks, Sophie Laplane follows 13 years as a dancer with Scottish Ballet by becoming its artist in residence. About to turn 35, the Frenchwoman, who trained at the Paris Opera Ballet school, made her first one-act commission, Sibilo, in 2016. Sibilo is sophisticated, classy choreography but has humour, too \u2013 molten duets, staccato gestures, elastic torsos and shimmying six-packs. Her piece Click!, for Ballet Black, saw the dancers in acid-bright suits, pointe shoes and shoulder pads, and the rhythm pinging through their bodies with some serious groove. It seemed as if it could take ballet in a fresh direction. Laplane has experimented with film and 360-degree video. Her work Maze was adapted into a short film shot in a derelict swimming pool in Glasgow, all gitchy electro music and jerky bodies, looking like two long-legged birds courting. Her latest piece, Dextera, was created to mark Scottish Ballet\u2019s 50th anniversary, and tackles gender politics with wit and cheek (to the sound of Mozart). She has also worked with New York City Ballet\u2019s Choreographic Institute, is creating a new piece in the space of one week for Scottish Ballet\u2019s Digital Season (it can be viewed on the company\u2019s Facebook feed), and is about to graduate with an MA in choreography \u2013 not that Laplane needs a certificate to prove her credentials. Sibilo and Dextera will be performed at Jacksons Lane, London, on 19 June. Arielle Smith Rambert-trained Arielle Smith has had one of the best starts you can imagine, landing a gig as young associate choreographer with Matthew Bourne\u2019s New Adventures company, working alongside Bourne on his new production of Romeo and Juliet. The Havana-born, British-raised 22-year-old created several pieces at the National Youth Ballet and has now set up her own company, with some excellent younger dancers. Smith enjoys making abstract mass movement, as in the piece Storm, which she created while still at school. But she\u2019s most interested in making dance that explores being human, not just dancing for dancing\u2019s sake. Her short piece Lots of Varied Expectations addresses that old favourite, love, against a warm and whimsical backdrop of 1940s songs, with movement that is fun and quirky, and with playful use of rhythm, but always with an underlying emotion. Smith is expanding the piece into a full-length work and plans a national tour next year. \u201cArielle\u2019s a wonder,\u201d says Bourne. \u201cI really liked the choreography she\u2019s done for National Youth Ballet. It stood out as being very contemporary, very different. She\u2019s very mature for her age. We laugh a lot. I think she\u2019s got a great future.\u201d \u2022 Romeo and Juliet is on tour until 12 October."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
