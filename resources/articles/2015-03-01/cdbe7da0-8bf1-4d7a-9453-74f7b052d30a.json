Barnett made the comments to PerthNow on Thursday morning, the same time as a meeting of the alliance of WA land councils in Broome. Aboriginal land councils used the meeting to insist that Aboriginal people be given a say in issues like the remote community closures, declaring in a joint statement that \u201cgovernments cannot decide where Aboriginal people live in Western Australia\u201d. Barnett was invited to attend that meeting but declined due to \u201cprior commitments\u201d. He told PerthNow that a \u201ccomprehensive look\u201d at the viability of remote Aboriginal communities was \u201cunder way\u201d and he expected it to uncover evidence of \u201cabuse\u201d. \u201cI won\u2019t walk away from this issue, I will probably get criticised, but there will be evidence come about appalling mistreatment of little kids,\u201d he said. \u201cI, as premier, cannot sit by and let that happen.\u201d But he said the \u201ccomprehensive look\u201d would not result in a report. \u201cI\u2019m not into reports, that\u2019s not my style.\u201d Barnett said in November that between 100 and 150 of the state\u2019s 282 remote Aboriginal communities may be forced to close, after the federal government handed responsibility for the communities to the state, along with $90m, which is the equivalent of two years\u2019 funding. He told PerthNow that \u201cmaybe the word \u2018closure\u2019 \u2026 wasn\u2019t the right word,\u201d but said that government support for some of the communities would not continue. \u201cWe want to see Aboriginal people succeed, we want to see their children have a safe life and a fair chance at life through a good education,\u201d he said. \u201cThat cannot happen in remote tiny communities, it cannot.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll consult, there\u2019s not going to be a bulldozer-type mentality, and we\u2019re going to determine which communities continue to get those municipal services, and probably better services, but it\u2019s not going to be 282.\u201d \u201cBulldozer-type mentality\u201d is not a metaphor in the Kimberley \u2013 in September the WA government began demolishing buildings left in Oombulgurri, an eastern Kimberley community that was forcibly closed in 2011. Labor Perth MP Alannah MacTiernan said the federal funding only applied to about 160 of WA\u2019s remote communities. A spokesman for the Kimberley Land Council said a number of communities were self-sufficient and have not received any government assistance in years. Barnett\u2019s comments appeared to contradict the conciliatory tone taken by the regional development minister Terry Redman, who did attend the meeting and spoke to Guardian Australia and other media in Broome. Redman said cutting off the services to up to 150 communities was not the government\u2019s current position, and he refused to use the word \u201cclosure\u201d. But he was unable to assure Aboriginal leaders that all of WA\u2019s remote Aboriginal communities would remain open and supported by the state. He said \u201cthe current circumstances\u201d of remote Aboriginal communities in WA were \u201cunacceptable\u201d in terms of their health, education and employment outcomes, and that addressing that required a \u201cvery planned, very strategic response\u201d from government, standing shoulder to shoulder with Aboriginal people. \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether there will or won\u2019t be community closures,\u201d Redman said. \u201cBut I know that in some that I\u2019ve been into, conditions are unacceptable. \u201cAnd I think, certainly one community that I saw, I wouldn\u2019t support it in any way with investment.\u201d Redman said that investment could include funding from the $1bn Royalties for Regions fund. It is not the first time there\u2019s been separation between Redman and Barnett on this policy. Barnett hosed down reports of Redman\u2019s initial suggestion of tying the Royalties for Regions fund to outcome-based projects in remote Aboriginal communities, but did say it may be appropriate to fund water and power services. Redman refused to say whether he agreed with Barnett\u2019s approach to the issue and instead referred to the cabinet approval process, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not going to share with anyone our discussions within government, and certainly between ministers and the premier, about how to take these issues forward.\u201d He said the state would not \u201cforce anyone out\u201d and the response of the land councils had been \u201cpleasing\u201d. \u201cI can see how a little uncertainty, with a little bit of information, has drawn some concerns,\u201d he said. Land council members who spoke to Guardian Australia said that uncertainty remained. In a statement released at the close of the meeting on Thursday the group said Aboriginal people should be given a \u201creal say in the issues that affect their lives and wellbeing\u201d. The Kimberley Land Council chairman Anthony Watson said Barnett\u2019s decision not to attend the meeting was \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d. Speaking on behalf of the land councils, Watson said it was good that Redman had said he wanted to engage with Aboriginal people, but it was unfortunate it had taken four months to get to that stage. He said that despite the government\u2019s claims it was consulting, Thursday was the first time a government minister had formally consulted with the peak bodies. \u201cIt is disappointing that they have taken so long to get back to us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want another Oombulgurri.\u201d Watson said that as far as he was concerned, there had been \u201cno changes\u201d in the message from government, and that up to 150 communities could still be shut down or have their essential services cut off. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the indication of what community is going to be targeted, so we\u2019re still guessing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe minister came up here today (and) \u2026 didn\u2019t get to bring any information about what the premier is telling him to do, so it\u2019s frustrating that we still haven\u2019t got that information.\u201d Labor Broome MLA Josie Farrer, Nationals MLA Jacqui Boydell and opposition Aboriginal affairs spokesman Ben Wyatt also addressed the meeting. Farrer, a Lungka-Gidja woman, told Guardian Australia that some remote communities in Western Australia did have a history of social problems or mismanagement, but that starving those communities of funding was not the solution. \u201cThis is why we have these high number of homeless people in the Broome area \u2013 because without a community, they have nowhere to go,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
