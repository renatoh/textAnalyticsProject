As Alice Roberts discovers \u2013 in a series that ambitiously tries to reflect the full span of British archaeology \u2013 that's not for a lack of digging, at sites such as the Sittingbourne cemetery that's yielded a huge number of skeletons. Just as illuminating is the way the programme goes on to show what happens when the getting-stuff-out-of-the-ground stage is over. Real Crime 9pm, ITV1 On 17 April 1984 PC Yvonne Fletcher was shot and fatally wounded as she policed a demonstration outside the Libyan embassy in London. But what exactly happened that day? Despite the political storm that followed when it became clear the bullet originated from the embassy, no killer has ever been identified. This documentary, however, drawing on previously unseen footage, argues that there might have been enough evidence to mount a prosecution. Interviewees include the former British ambassador in Tripoli, Oliver Miles, who reveals how, some 12 hours before the shooting, Libyan officials advised him to have the demonstration stopped. The Saturdays: 24/7 9pm, ITV2 For a very long time, the Saturdays occupied a weird position in pop, with their fame and celebrity far exceeding their ability to sell any records. Chart-watchers will know that they turned it around with Missing You, almost a number one hit. That \"almost\" is bad news for Rochelle's psychic, who predicts on tonight's show that it will go to the top of the charts. As well as receiving shaky readings of the future, the ladies go to a spa, hang out with their friends and get proposed to by fans. It's all very ITV2. I Think We're Alone Now 10pm, Really This strange, disturbing documentary follows two megafans as they attempt to explain their devotion to Tiffany, who last seriously bothered the charts with her 1987 hit I Think We're Alone Now. Jeff has Asperger's, an encyclopaedic knowledge of his idol, a restraining order, and a belief that he and Tiffany, with whom he communicates \"spiritually\" using a helmet he's made, will be married. Kelly, meanwhile, is intersex, has problems with drugs, and similarly believes that Tiffany is her only chance of happiness. The word \"stalkers\" doesn't begin to explain how damaged and vulnerable these people are. The King Is Dead 10.30pm, BBC3 This new panel comedy presented by The Inbetweeners' Simon Bird is based around the theme of a recruitment drive. Each week, three C-listers jostle to be promoted to a fictional role in the community. In this first run, ex-CBBC presenter Kirsten O'Brien, model Caprice, and The Bill's Graham Cole fight it out to be named fictional chief of police. Their tasks involve drawing a self-portrait while handcuffed to a brass band and treading a vat full of meat. Co-presenter Nick Mohammed, wades in with a few good one-liners but overall it's more Chucklevision than Shooting Stars. Coming Up: Boy 12.15am, Channel 4 The last in a run of Channel 4's admirable and absorbing showcase for new filmmakers, Boy, starring newcomer Gerard McDonald, tells the story of a boy kept locked in his room until he finds a friendly mouse for company. Written by Ronan Blaney and directed by Matthew Lenton, this intriguing short follows the boy as he searches for food to give his new murine friend."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
