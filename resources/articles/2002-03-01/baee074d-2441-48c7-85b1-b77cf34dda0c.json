Dan Perkins has needed two operations as well as the regulation blood, sweat and tears to make it to his seat in the Oxford boat and yesterday he recalled the \"big shock\" that rudely interrupted his undergraduate rowing days at Dartmouth College in 1995. \"One day I was racing at the Eastern Sprints - a big race in the States - and the next day I had no feeling in the right side of my body and was unable to speak. \"It happened in the middle of the day. I was eating lunch and drinking a glass of soda and it just fell through my hand. It was completely out of the blue. \"There was no pain but it was definitely a big shock. They found a golfball-sized tumour and told me I had at the most two years to live because it was inoperable.\" Understandably Perkins went looking for a doctor who would give it a try and discovered Richard Frasier, a New York neurosurgeon. Six months after the operation, he was back rowing. He graduated in 1998 and won the double sculls in the US team trials for the world championships in 1999 but then had another seizure before he got to the worlds. Frasier operated again, and now Perkins is studying education at Brasenose with his sights on the Athens Olympics. Not surprisingly the experience has given him a keen determination to make the most of his talents. \"It has really motivated me to excel,\" Perkins said. In the eights named yesterday by the Oxford president Benjamin Burch and his opposite number Thomas Stallard, each boat includes four who have previously done battle from Putney to Mortlake, with last year's winners Cambridge having in Rick Dunn a double world champion and a member of the 2001 Great Britain coxless four that retained the world title won by Steve Redgrave, Matthew Pinsent and co. Among the newcomers is the Australian Stu Welch, who won an Olympic silver medal in the Sydney eight. Along with three Americans, two Australians and Sebastian Mayer - a member of Germany's double sculls crew in the Sydney Olympics - is the race's first Dutchman, Oxford's Gerritjan \"Big G\" Eggenkamp.
