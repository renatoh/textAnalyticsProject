It has been estimated that up to 80% of travellers will experience sickness while away. This may often be minor, such as sunburn or diarrhoea, but UK doctors are seeing increasing amounts of rare tropical conditions. Malaria, dengue fever and even rabies are on the increase - all contracted abroad with symptoms developing at home. Never fail to mention to a doctor that you have been travelling, even if you think it can't possibly be relevant. Let them decide, as many diseases take a long time to incubate or can present in ways mimicking common UK problems. And remember that last-minute holiday preparations should not include a trip to the GP for anti-malarial tablets - this should have been done well in advance. But there is good news. Many websites offer pre-departure information, so you know which shots to have. And anti-malarials can be ordered online. In addition, there are many good new medications to help the traveller stay in peak condition: from malarone to ciprofloxacin, most illnesses can be prevented or treated quickly without the appropriate drug. Finally, do not forget that prevention is more than just having a vaccine or a tablet. Start on the flight with an aspirin and some in-flight exercise to ward off DVT. On arrival, try to avoid being bitten by wearing appropriate clothing and sleeping under nets. Clean and peel all fruit in sterile water. And remember that most bugs can survive life in an ice cube, so be careful with the cocktails. Europe You may feel at home in many of the countries here but disease still lurks around the corner. Watch out for: As with the rest of the world, always make sure you are up to date with tetanus and polio. Malaria no longer exists except in Georgia and eastern Turkey. Precautions: If you are in the Balkans and beyond, have a hepatitis A shot. Tick-borne encephalitis is a serious illness, causing fever and, later, severe neurological symptoms. It is found in the undergrowth in deciduous forests. Beware if you are camping or hiking. A vaccine is available. Legionnaire's disease still does occur in hotels, so report any chest infections you may get on your return. To avoid it, simply flush out any bacteria by running baths first before using the plug. Rabies does exist, but the post-bite vaccine is widely available so pre-departure shots are not mandatory. On the Mediterranean coast, night-biting sand flies can spread leishmaniasis. Watch out for ulcers and unexplained fevers. For free medical treatment in European Union countries, get an E111 form from your Post Office before you go. North America Health service provision is the world's best but most expensive. Do not come here without travel health insurance. Bills can be huge and you will not be discharged until you can show you can settle up. Watch out for: Tick-borne illnesses. Rocky Mountain spotted fever and lyme disease are most frequently contracted by hikers or campers. If you visit the deserts of Arizona or New Mexico watch out for scorpions and snakes. Precautions: Bite avoidance is easy: wear high boots and long trousers. A tick is best removed by covering it in Vaseline so it suffocates and falls out. If you get any tick bites with symptoms afterwards, then see a doctor quickly. Anti-venom is freely available should you be stung or bitten by a scorpion or snake. There are no mandatory vaccinations needed for North America, but children may be asked to show proof of immunity to MMR, tetanus and pertussis. Asia Whether diving, trekking or just lying on the beach, medical help can be remote in outlying areas. So take a basic medical kit with you at the very least. Watch out for: The commonest illness here is diarrhoea, which is caused by poor food hygiene. Use antibiotics early during the course of this illness. Take them with you to be well prepared. Dengue and leishmaniasis also occur widely, so prevent all mosquito bites. Rarer diseases that occur include TB, plague and cholera. Vaccinations are available but only at specialist centres. Precautions: Hepatitis A, typhoid, polio and diptheria shots are all needed. Rabies is also recommended if you travel away from major cities. Malaria is countered by malarone across most of the area, but cloroquine and paludrine will do for a lot of the higher and dryer countries. A Japanese encephalitis shot is also needed. Central America and South America You have every hazard here, from yellow fever to killer bees. Watch out for: Get specific information for each country, but for the region as a whole, hepatitis A, yellow fever and rabies exist. This is especially true for the backpacker. Precautions: For longer stays, immunise against TB, hepatitis B and diptheria. Malaria is present throughout the region. Chloroquine is recommended along with paludrine in certain areas east of the Panama Canal. If staying in semi-urban zones in eastern South America, always use a net at night. This will protect against chaga's spread by the evil cone-nosed bug. Dengue and yellow fever are spread by mosquitoes, as is malaria. Marinade your net in Deet before you travel, to ensure you do not get bitten. Painless sores on the skin are diagnostic of leishmaniasis. This is a bug spread by the bite of sand-flies. They are prevented by the nets at night and good clothing by day. Bilharzia can occur in this region. Take the same precautions that you would if travelling in Africa. If swimming in South American fresh water lakes and rivers, pirhanas are not the worst fish. Avoid the urethra fish, a spiny little scamp that swims up the urethra and hangs in there with its fin barbs. Preventionentails not urinating underwater. The cure is with a knife. Australasia No specific vaccines are needed for this region, but travellers from a yellow fever zone must show that they have been immunised. Watch out for: Dengue and malaria in the extreme north-east of Australia, Eastern PNG and the outlying islands. The main concern in mainland Australia is venomous creatures. Precautions: Prepared travellers always keep a charged mobile in isolated areas. Anti-venom is widely available but make sure you can get to it quickly. When swimming or surfing, check the local warning flags or ask around for where is safe. Jellyfish can be a problem, even near shore, so wear a stinger suit in the water. Vinegar is the best way of stopping a sting, with urine a close second. If you are stung and experience shortness of breath or worsening symptoms, call the emergency services. Ticks here can spread scrub typhus: watch out for a bite that leaves a big bump and symptoms of fever. Treat with the antibiotic doxycycline. Africa This continent provides the greatest number of deaths in the returning traveller, so you must be prepared properly. Watch out for: The biggest threats to the traveller in the far south are car accidents - best avoided by driving during the day. Some lakes that have been declared safe, are, in fact, infested with bilharzias and the snail that transmits it. Avoid the shore in bare feet and swim off a boat well offshore. Worms can infect a traveller in the bush. Many species exist, from ascaris that infest the bowel, to loa loa that swim across the eye. The worst threat is HIV. The carrier rate for HIV can be above 80% among some populations here. Precautions: Hepatitis A shot is mandatory for all countries, as is typhoid. Yellow fever will be needed in all tourist destinations except South Africa. Polio and tetanus must be kept up to date. If you are going to stay a while, then get a meningitis vaccine. Malaria tablets are necessary. As a rule, use chloroquine and paludrine in the dry, desert north. Use malarone elsewhere. South Africa is reportedly malaria-free, but take them if you are in the Kruger National Park."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
