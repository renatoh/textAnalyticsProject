The omens are good for Celtic, who arrived here yesterday seeking a first victory on foreign soil in the Champions League under Martin O'Neill. There has been failure gallant and galling in places like Porto, Trondheim, Turin and, four weeks ago, in Munich. Not so much as a point has been garnered as Celtic were forced to rely on their intimidating form in Glasgow. But Celtic have had five matches since losing late on and cruelly to Bayern Munich and all five have been won. One of those triumphs was unforgettable, against Lyon at Parkhead; another was invigorating, against Rangers at Ibrox. They came within the space of five days and Celtic have been rising ever since. On Saturday they won 5-0 to break Hearts. Tonight they will want to raise hearts - their own. \"We've been playing well recently,\" said O'Neill before Celtic's training session at the Anderlecht stadium last night. \"But that doesn't count for anything. It gives you confidence but that's all it does.\" O'Neill then stressed the difficulty of winning any away fixture in the Champions League - \"Ask Alex Ferguson,\" he said - and indeed this is the venue where Manchester United were beaten 2-1 three years ago, Tomasz Radzinski earning a move to Everton with both goals and an all-round speedy performance. Anderlecht are top of the Belgian First Division once again, five points ahead of Genk. But having lost 1-0 at Lyon and then drawn 1-1 at home with Bayern, they can see their European season disappearing. Their coach Hugo Broos was realistic yesterday. He made Celtic favourites and said: \"Our season depends on this but by the end of the evening we could be out.\" For that to happen Celtic would have achieved a breakthrough win. With Anderlecht at Parkhead in the next match, two wins and six points would leave Celtic in a strong position to claim one of the two top spots in Group A. \"Nothing will be decided until after the fourth game in the group,\" said O'Neill, but he added that Celtic will be going for victory. \"I don't know how to play for a draw.\" In terms of his team selection O'Neill has decisions to make about Chris Sutton, John Hartson and the up-and-coming Irishman, Liam Miller. It would seem to be a case of perming two from those three with Miller again impressing in scoring twice against Hearts. \"He's a terrific prospect. Anyone who has seen him lately would be pleasantly surprised,\" said O'Neill of Miller. Previously Miller's career had been blighted by injury. But good form may not be enough to unseat either Sutton or Hartson. However, continued good form from Celtic may be enough to unseat Anderlecht. \"A win would kill Anderlecht off,\" said Stilian Petrov. \"If we win, they haven't much chance of getting through. When you can take one team out of the competition you feel more confidence. We would then be looking at a Uefa Cup place at the very least.\" Anderlecht (probable, 4-4-2): Zitka; Zewlakow, De Boeck, Kompany, Deschacht; Whilhelmsson, Hasi, Baseggio, Kolar; Mornar, Dindane. Celtic (possible, 3-5-2): Hedman; Varga, Balde, McNamara; Agathe, Lennon, Sutton, Petrov, Thompson; Larsson, Hartson. Referee: F Stuchlik (Austria). TV: ITV2, kick-off 7.45pm"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
