Lee J Cobb is the domineering old goat of a father who makes a lifetime's work out of undermining his sons, among them Yul Brynner and William Shatner: it's a bold, if flawed, enterprise. An Inconvenient Truth 8pm, Sky Movies Premiere (Davis Guggenheim, 2006) The real war is not on terror but on global warming - that's the message from former US vice-president Al Gore in this Oscar-winning documentary. Basically a filmed version of Gore's touring lecture on the environmental disaster looming ahead, it's scholarly, fascinating, frightening, and leaves you with a burning question: why oh why did this man not become president? Fantastic Four 9pm, Film4 (Tim Story, 2005) Refreshing to happen on a bunch of superheroes who actually seem to enjoy their superness: this is a fun-oriented account of how the Marvel comics quartet acquire their powers and save the world from Dr Doom (Julian McMahon). Stretchy Reed, Invisible Sue, Lumpy Ben and Hot Johnny remain resolutely two-dimensional, allowing more time for exhilarating super-battles.
