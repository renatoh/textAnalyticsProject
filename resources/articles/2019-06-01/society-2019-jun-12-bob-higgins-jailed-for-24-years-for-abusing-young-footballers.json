Survivors called on high-profile players and managers who worked with Higgins at Southampton FC to explain what they knew of his offending and claimed that by remaining quiet they continued to protect him. They said Peterborough FC, where Higgins was also employed, and the Football Association also needed to come clean about why he had been able to coach and abuse youth players for seven years after concerns were raised about him. Higgins, 66, from Southampton, showed no emotion as Judge Peter Crabtree jailed him at Winchester crown court for the abuse of 24 schoolboys over a 25-year period from 1971 to 1996. The judge said Higgins was a cunning and manipulative predator who abused his position of trust as a respected coach and caused real, enduring harm to his victims. Higgins had not shown a jot of remorse, he said. Many of his victims, now middle-aged men, sat in the public gallery as Higgins was sentenced. They had testified to suffering decades of mental health problems because of his crimes, and expressed anger, shame and guilt at what had happened to them. Some told the court they had tried to kill themselves, and many said they had struggled over the years with flashbacks, panic attacks, depression, anxiety, lack of trust and problems with personal relationships. A number went on to have good careers in football, but some said they had lost their chance of fulfilling their potential because of Higgins. After the sentencing, Hampshire police said more people had come forward to make allegations against Higgins since his conviction and that the possibility of further prosecutions had not been ruled out. On the steps of the court, survivors made it clear their fight for justice was not over. The former Southampton youth player Dean Radford described how he and other boys came forward in 1989 to reveal that Higgins had abused him but were not believed. \u201cWe hope those Southampton club directors, high-profile players and management who spent time with Higgins will stand up and tell the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe many people must have known what was going on. By not speaking out these people were and still are protecting a predatory paedophile.\u201d Radford paid tribute to the former Southampton junior star and Higgins victim Billy Seymour, who died in a car crash earlier this year. He said: \u201cBilly will be looking down on us smiling knowing Bob Higgins cannot harm any other child ever again. He will never be forgotten. We did it Billy, just like you said we would. You can now rest in peace our dear friend.\u201d Higgins worked with youngsters at Southampton between 1975 and 1990 and at Peterborough between 1994 and 1996. When the Guardian broke the story of abuse within football in 2016, Higgins was still working in the game, though not as a coach of junior players. Dion Raitt, who was abused by Higgins as a junior player at Peterborough, said Higgins used the boys\u2019 hunger to succeed to exploit them. He said: \u201cFootball was our lives, football was our dreams. We would have done anything to make it as a professional footballer. \u201cThere remain many questions that we deserve answers to. How was Bob Higgins able to slip through the net for so long? How was he ever put into a position of power at a professional football club like Peterborough United?\u201d Raitt said it was \u201cespecially shocking\u201d that in 1989 the Football League, then the game\u2019s governing body, had issued a warning to all clubs about Higgins. \u201cSadly because of potential failings we were subjected to horrific abuse at the hands of Higgins,\u201d he said. During the sentencing hearing, another victim, who cannot be named, criticised the FA and Southampton over their handling of Higgins. He asked the court: \u201cWhere were Southampton? Where were the FA? Where was their due diligence and safeguarding policies? They had a duty of care, a responsibility.\u201d Two other former Southampton youth players, Anthony Connolly and Lee Smith, waived their right to anonymity. Connolly had told the court he first met Higgins when he was 12 and said the coach groomed his parents as well as him. Addressing Higgins directly, he said: \u201cYou took away my childhood.\u201d He said the abuse created a \u201cvoid inside of me\u201d filled with \u201cfear, anxiety and torment\u201d. He said he had turned to drink to try to drive the fear away and suffered mental health issues. \u201cI hope Southampton FC and the English FA have learned from their mistakes,\u201d he said in court. \u201cI hope the proper safeguarding is in place.\u201d Smith described Higgins as a monster who ruined the dreams of his victims for his own \u201csick perverted satisfaction\u201d and said: \u201cThe football community is now a much safer place.\u201d Southampton and Peterborough have apologised to the victims. After Higgins\u2019s conviction the FA said it recognised their distress. \u201cWe continue to signpost victims and survivors to speak to Clive Sheldon QC whose team is conducting the independent inquiry into allegations of non-recent child sexual abuse in football,\u201d it said Both football clubs declined to comment on Wednesday on the former players\u2019 calls for more answers. An FA spokesperson said: \u201cThe FA has commissioned an independent QC to conduct a review into, what, if anything, the FA and clubs knew about the allegations of child sexual abuse at the relevant time, and what action was taken or should have taken place. \u201cIt is therefore inappropriate for the FA to comment on these questions whilst that review is ongoing.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
