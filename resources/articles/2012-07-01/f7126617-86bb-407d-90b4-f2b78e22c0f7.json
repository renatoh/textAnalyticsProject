Pushed back a bit more when Balzaretti came on Gerard Piqu\u00e9 7 Another assured display by the former Manchester United defender. Booked for a first-half lunge on Cassano Sergio Ramos 7 Who needs Carles Puyol? Well, Spain don't. Last night Ramos and Piqu\u00e9 did not give Cassano or Balotelli a sniff of a chance Jordi Alba 9 (man of the match) Lung-bursting run for his goal \u2013 his first for Spain \u2013 and what a cool finish for a left-back. No wonder Bar\u00e7a have signed him Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez 9 Set up two of the goals with inch-perfect passes. Another wonderful performance by a wonderful player Sergio Busquests 7 Worked tirelessly, as always, with one particular intervention standing out, against Balzaretti down the right in the second half Xabi Alonso 8 Contributed heavily towards keeping Italy's main threat, Pirlo, out of the game with his constant harrying and pressing Cesc F\u00e1bregas 8 Too quick for Chiellini to set up Silva for the first goal. A superb performance and went close with a long-range shot after the break David Silva 7 The City forward saved his best display for the final, stealing in between Barzagli and Bonucci to score an alert opener Andr\u00e9s Iniesta 7 Displayed remarkable energy as he burst forward as often as he found himself tracking back to check the forward runs of Abate Italy Gianluigi Buffon 6 Cannot be blamed for any of the goals and had to be alert on several occasions to avoid a rout as Spain pushed forward Ignazio Abate 6 Struggled to contain Iniesta on his flank and was wasteful with some of his passing. Looked better when going forward Andrea Barzagli 5 Italy's back four was completely exposed by Spain's speed and passing.Barzagli was hopelessly outpaced by Alba for Spain's second Leonardo Bonucci 5 Struggled alongside his Juventus team-mate in central defence. Lost Silva in the buildup to the first goal Giorgio Chiellini 3 Endured a nightmare 20 minutes, during which F\u00e1bregas flew past him to set up the first goal, before going off with a knee injury Andrea Pirlo 6 Did not play badly but did not reach his normal standard on a night when his hopes of winning Ballon d'Or all but disappeared Claudio Marchisio 6 Fairly ineffective but then he did not see the ball much, stranded out on the right where Iniesta was running riot Riccardo Montolivo 7 Was behind most of Italy's good moves, including setting up Balotelli with a backheel, but made way for Thiago Motta Daniele De Rossi 6 Decent first half by the Roma midfielder, when he battled bravely against a sea of red, but anonymous in the second half Mario Balotelli 6 Firmly in the pocket of Ramos and Piqu\u00e9, the match-winner against Germany was restricted to wild shots from distance Antonio Cassano 5 Had one chance but shot lacked power and bobbled into Casillas's hands. Not at his effervescent best and replaced at half-time"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
