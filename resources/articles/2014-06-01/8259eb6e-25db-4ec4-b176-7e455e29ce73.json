Injury and illness stilted her progression and a dramatic slide in the rankings followed. Within months a top-50 player had slumped to well outside the top 100 while two of her compatriots were the toast of the nation after their displays on the lawns of Wimbledon. Many years from now, though, when Watson puts her racket back in its case for the last time, she may reflect on the glandular fever that derailed her season so spectacularly as the turning point in a career that had previously glimmered but not gleamed. The young Brit enters Wimbledon in excellent form, with a refreshing aggression that became a necessity in the midst of her energy-sapping illness. \u201cI was so tired in the matches that I couldn\u2019t run, so I had no other choice,\u201d says Watson of her new approach. \u201cEven at the Australian Open I was in my first-round match, this is when I didn\u2019t know I was ill, losing to [Alexandra] Cadantu. I saw it as a good draw and I\u2019m a set and 3-1 down and I\u2019m like: \u2018Oh my God, I can\u2019t move, I\u2019m so tired I need to hit winners.\u2019So I hit winners, and I was like: \u2018My God, this is awesome.\u2019\u201d Aggression has certainly paid off this year for the 22-year-old, who returned to the top 100 after her success on clay at the Prague Open last month and continued to thrive on the grass with a fine performance at Eastbourne\u2019s Aegon International, producing arguably the best performance of her career to beat the world No12, Flavia Pennetta, in the second round and reach the semi-finals. She will rise from 70th in the world standings in the aftermath. It is a timely return to prominence for Watson, whose name you would have struggled to find in discussions at the All England Club last summer, when a first-round exit was swiftly forgotten before the triumph of Andy Murray and the captivating run by her friend Laura Robson to the fourth round. Reaching the second week at Wimbledon this year and replicating Robson\u2019s achievement is something Watson feels she is capable of. She was drawn in the first round on Friday against the Croation Ajla Tomljanovic, although she could meet the No9 seed Angelique Kerber in the second round. \u201cThe new attacking style is down to me,\u201d says Watson. \u201cI decided to go down that road because I think it\u2019s going to win me more matches. I can move well and chase from the baseline, but I don\u2019t want to play on the back foot all the time because it\u2019s exhausting. \u201cI want to be more in control of rallies \u2013 as I\u2019ve found out this year, it\u2019s a lot more fun playing that way. Fortune favours the brave in tennis. Players are getting better and more agile, and it\u2019s not enough just to wait for your opponent to make mistakes because a lot of the girls are more consistent and they are hitting winners.\u201d She adds: \u201cYou can have a good attitude on court, and hold yourself well, but you can also do that by showing your opponent that you\u2019re prepared to take risks. Last year I was not as aggressive and my style of play was not a true reflection of my personality.\u201d There is another, more significant reason why Watson is determined to perform at Wimbledon this summer. The death of the former British No1 Elena Baltacha has sent shockwaves across the tennis world, with players coming out in force during last weekend\u2019s Rally for Bally to raise money for charity and Baltacha\u2019s academy. Baltacha and Anne Keothavong carried the torch for the British women\u2019s game for so long, bearing the brunt of scrutiny every summer at Wimbledon, and Watson admits Baltacha will be at the forefront of her mind: \u201cI was in Cannes for my first tournament back after a rib injury, I woke up and I had a message from Laura and she wrote: \u2018I can\u2019t believe it, so sad\u2019. \u201cI thought what\u2019s she talking about, that\u2019s the most random message ever, and then I go to read the news and I see this about Bally and it just hit me. I sent Laura a message back and I just started crying. It\u2019s so sad, I had no idea before that. Then I checked my emails and I had lots of emails. It was an absolute shock that we are never going to see her again. Thoughts are just with her friends and family \u2013 and not just with us British players but everybody in the whole WTA circuit is there, thinking about her.\u201d It is easy to forget that Watson is still only 22, an indication of how early she emerged on the national radar. However, the Guernsey player no longer considers herself inexperienced. It is important, she says, to have both the hunger of youth and the cunning of know-how, something emphasised when watching Eugenie Bouchard\u2019s run to the French Open semi-finals. \u201cWatching Eugenie versus [Maria] Sharapova, I wanted to be the young gun like Eugenie, but also I wanted to have all that experience under my belt like Sharapova,\u201d Watson adds. \u201cI definitely feel very experienced on the tour \u2013 I\u2019ve been on for five years now. I feel everybody has their time where they break through. They do well, they get to the highest they can do, whether that\u2019s No1 or No50 or whatever, and I feel like mine is going to come soon. I feel like it wasn\u2019t last year, it wasn\u2019t when I was at my highest ranking. I feel like now is the time.\u201d Heather Watson was speaking at a Give it Your Max charity tournament as part of Statoil\u2019s \u2018Heroes of Tomorrow\u2019 initiative, which supports young people in sport, education and culture"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
