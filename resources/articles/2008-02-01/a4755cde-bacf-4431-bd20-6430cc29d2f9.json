King scored the best try of an entertaining night, galloping over from 40 metres after a sharp left-wing break by Kevin Penny, but only after Monaghan had provided the crucial pass, just as he did for three more of the Wolves scores. The former Manly half-back's performance provided the hardest evidence that the notorious under-achievers of the British game really could be serious contenders this year, although it would be dangerous to get carried away. Warrington began last season with a rousing win at Wigan only for their challenge to fizzle away. Despite being given little chance because of a reshuffle forced by an accident-prone pre-season, Hull still scored the first points through a Danny Tickle penalty. But it was not long before Warrington were exposing the lack of experience in defence of Danny Williams, their late loan signing from Leeds, as he was sucked out of position twice in five minutes, allowing Chris Bridge then the debutant Australian wing Chris Hicks to touch down for the Wolves. Lee Briers was unable to convert either, allowing Hull to level at 8-8 when their centre Craig Hall capitalised on a defensive howler from Bridge following Danny Washbrook's harmless-looking kick. But Warrington reasserted themselves with what appeared to be a decisive double strike around the half-hour. Monaghan was the key figure in both tries, floating a long pass that allowed Vinnie Anderson to cross on the left and then catching Hull cold from the kick-off to send Penny sprinting down the same flank. Penny, the teenage flier who made such an impact in the back half of last season, showed composure to draw the full-back and pass inside to King, and the tall centre darted over from 40 metres. Hull cut the deficit to 20-14 before half-time when their major Australian signing Shaun Berrigan laid on a second try for Hall. But Monaghan was soon underlining his value and re-establishing Warrington's cushion with a beautifully delayed pass to send Ben Westwood crashing over. Hull hung in gamely for the next 20 minutes until a second try for Bridge, set up by Paul Rauhihi's offload, removed any lingering doubt about the outcome, although even then the visitors had the spirit to respond with a late Graeme Horne score. They will have taken as many positives from this defeat as Warrington can from the expected victory. It is ridiculously early days to be making predictions but it would be a surprise if both these teams do not figure in the top-six play-offs.
