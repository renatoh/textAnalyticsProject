My hotel had a blacksmith out the back \u2013 I think they all do \u2013 and on this day of all days kilted grooms and princess brides processed out there, one after the other, clutching horseshoes for till-death-us-do-part good luck. Just down the road, behind the town's retail outlet village, was the quiet symbol of that other precarious union, the \"Hands across the Border\" cairn. The cairn had been laid, stone on stone, by \"No\" voters, a simple beacon of solidarity on a spot beside the A74(M) to Carlisle, a site on which Alex Salmond refused to confirm or deny there would be passport control if independence won the day. The cairn was the idea of Rory Stewart, the Tory MP whose English constituency edged the other side of the River Esk, and whose understanding of the introspective perils of tribalism had partly been formed in his tours of diplomatic duty in Afghanistan and Iraq. Stewart had been one of the few in that \"Westminster bubble\" of which we were hearing so much, who had been alive to the danger of the breakup of the union, long before the opinion polls started to shift and the trio of party leaders had hot-footed it up here, with sweaty promises, in the past fortnight. In February, Stewart had intuited that Alistair Darling's Better Together economic arguments and the attendant fear of the unknown might not be enough; that nationalism makes more primal appeal. The speech Stewart gave to parliament back then was a storm warning \u2013 \"We're not very good, as politicians, at talking about emotions,\" he said, \"\u2026[but] what matters is not the wall that divides us but the human ties that bind in the arms of love.\" His words fell on mostly deaf ears. The cairn \u2013 the ancient guide to an uncertain future, advertised through social media \u2013 had been born out of that. On Thursday evening a No vigil was planned at the site. There were braziers and burgers and single malt. Stewart's cairn team predicted a few hundred supporters but there were only a couple of dozen, some up from London or Cumbria, some from Gretna and points north. Stewart himself patrolled nervously, talking to me about \"the need at this time for a broader vision of nationhood\". It wasn't a raucous crowd. But then I suppose silent majorities rarely are. For much of this campaign, watching from the south, it had seemed like the emotion had been all on the side of the breakup. It had been a challenge, as in any long union, to find passion in the status quo. Of course there were well-rehearsed financial arguments for staying together, and the familiar divorce logistics of who would get what, but shouldn't Scotland, a big part of which had fallen long out of love with a domineering partner that never understood it, simply follow its instincts? That heart-and-head opposition was decisively undermined by the late, dramatic intervention of Gordon Brown, who, like Mr Darcy emerging from a loch and shaking himself dry, came up with a different, ardent address. His \"vow\" was front-page news. And then, on the day before voting, he gave his declaration of love. Many people I later spoke to, referenced Brown's speech in Glasgow \u2013 downloaded hundreds of thousands of times that afternoon before polling \u2013 as a critical turning point. It was the positive inflection of No. A reminder that \"British\" might not be a beleagured catch-all identity but a unique and hard-won defence against narrow nationalism, a procreative union in which individuality and devolved power could thrive. The two nations had \"fought together, suffered together, sacrificed together, mourned together and then celebrated together,\" Brown roared, remembering what it felt like to be a man possessed. And of course he concluded with a powerful echo from the nuptial vow \u2013 words he had no doubt grown up hearing in his father's kirk \u2013 \"what we created together, let no nationalist split asunder \u2026\" Gretna Green knows all about mornings after. At first light on Friday, after Huw Edwards had announced that the reconsecrated union had made it through the night, and it was confirmed that the two ancient bedfellows were prepared to give it another go (with traditional promises to change, determination to give each other a bit more space), I wandered down again to the cairn. Stewart and his team looked less euphoric than shagged out. There was a sense of mission accomplished, though triumphalism was in short supply. I headed to Fife, to Brown's seat at Kirkcaldy, to see if the fires of Britishness burned strongly there on this new morning. Driving through West Lothian, the West Lothian question was live on the radio airwaves. That potent idea of strength in unity, having served its purpose, seemed already in retreat, and much of the radio talk was again of division and partial interest. There was phone-in consensus about a few things \u2013 that this was not the end of a story but the beginning, that vows were made to be kept, and that the turnout, the engagement, was a thing of wonder. Highly informed and articulate 16-year-olds, initiated in the power of democracy, spoke emotionally about the most memorable day of their lives, for better and worse. You don't have to spend too long in Kirkcaldy to know it was never really built for public displays of affection. There was, that morning after, not a single sign of the momentous events of the night before. Outside the Fife Institute, I asked a group of lads if they had stayed up for the count: \"Aye\". And the result? \"We bottled it\". What next? They gestured toward a six-pack of ale in a bag. At the Kirkcaldy Art Gallery there is an appropriate sounding exhibition of \"Tall Tales and Fabulous Fables\", and in the cafe, old friends are arguing about the result over the free papers. Sandy Watt, a retired textile worker, is 67 and has been voting SNP ever since Ted Heath became prime minister. What did he make of Brown's appeal to Britishness? \"I was never much for Gordon,\" he says. St Bryce's Kirk, over the road from Adam Smith Theatre (Kirkcaldy, you have the sense, actually doubles as a chancellor of the exchequer theme park) is where John Ebenezer Brown, Gordon's father, used to preach. It is operating a lively food bank. No one inside seems too chuffed at how things have gone. \"I think it was the canny Scots, who were worried about losing the pound,\" says Carol Adair, who is serving tea. \"I think it was our last chance. Today folk are frightened to say who did what. Nobody wants trouble.\" Were they at least proud that the local prodigal had returned to win the day? Adair laughs. \"He can talk, I'll give him that. But I've never been able to stand him, to be honest.\" I drove from Kirkcaldy to Edinburgh, and to Holyrood, where the new beginning for Scotland would start. Up the road at his official residence, Alex Salmond was announcing that his 25-year courtship of the Scottish people, his whispering that the grass beyond the union would be greener, was at an end, \"though the dream shall never die\". He left with the parting shot that those sacred vows made to the Scottish people had been broken by Westminster politicking already. Outside the parliament there was not a no voter in sight, save one man who was circling in a car sounding his horn, until the police moved him on. Yes campaigners with bedraggled saltires were reacting to their leader's departure. Kyle Mackay, a 26-year-old gardener from Edinburgh, proclaimed Salmond \"a genuine Scottish hero,\" and suggested that \"I think people are already regretting voting against this. You won't be hearing any no parties tonight\". That much was true. Walking the length of the Royal Mile, you'd hardly have guessed anything had gone on at all. The pubs were pretty quiet. It had been a long night, and a long campaign. The following morning, though, I went to hear Brown addressing his constituents at the Dalgety Primary School in Fife, and once again was given a sense of what this all might yet mean. To a series of standing ovations, Brown spoke with the passion of a man given a surprising second chance, and determined to learn from the mistakes of the past. He reaffirmed the vow of Wednesday: \"the men who have been promise-makers will not be promise-breakers!\" Things would be different, he said, more equal. He spoke the language of marriage guidance everywhere: \"Don't let us believe there are irreconcilable differences,\" he said, \"let us build a sharing and caring union!\" For the moment at least he made it sound, once again, just like the triumph of hope over expectation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
