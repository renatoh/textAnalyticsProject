United lie eighth, 13 points adrift of the leaders, Arsenal, after scoring just eight goals and securing just three wins at home in the Premier League. Newcastle United and Everton were the last teams to visit Old Trafford on league business, with both recording 1-0 victories. \"When we lost against Everton and the game against Newcastle, it was obvious we looked a little bit worried,\" said Evra. \"The crowd were not happy sometimes. It is not easy for anyone. \"But we play for Manchester United. We have to deal with that because we need them [the supporters]. We have to show them first on the pitch by playing well. If they want to criticise us, we deserve that because when you play for Manchester United, you have to play with the pressure.\" Evra and his team-mates have their latest chance to impress United's home support when they take on West Ham on Saturday. Wednesday night's Capital One Cup win at Stoke, in which Evra scored, was United's third victory in succession in all competitions. \"I want to get another unbeaten run going but this time we do not want to slip back again,\" Evra said. \"It is too painful. It is too painful for us, for the staff, for the fans. We have to make sure we keep winning games. We must not slip again because we have already done that too many times. \"I am not looking at the table, I look at the next game which is West Ham at home. Last year we won that kind of game. We have more trouble at Old Trafford. That is where we have to show our character and our personality and play with the Manchester United spirit. Of course we need points. I wouldn't lie and say anything else. I just want to rest and be focused on Saturday. You can talk a lot; what counts is how you act on the pitch.\" United's three-game winning streak has come without the concession of a single goal. \"The team is really focused on that,\" Evra said. \"We know when we get some clean sheets we can win games. The conditions at Stoke were not easy but you could feel the Manchester United spirit coming back. To win 2-0 at Stoke, it has to be a great performance. Even the players who have not played very often, like Ashley [Young] and Anderson played very well. \"That is the name of the game now. We have to focus only on the present. We do not want to let down the Manchester United fans and the staff and ourselves. When we lost against Everton and Newcastle it was a massive blow but we have reacted well with three wins in a row. We have to make sure we win on Saturday. That is my concern and that is my focus.\" Evra's team-mate Jonny Evans warned against the assumption of an all-Manchester Capital One Cup final. United will play Sunderland in the last four, with Manchester City drawn against West Ham. \"That is dangerous talk,\" he said. \"I wouldn't say we're glad to avoided City. We played them a couple of years ago in the [2010] semi-finals, and we had two fantastic games with them, lots of action and goals and we got through to the final against Aston Villa. \"So I don't think it really matters. At the end of the day you are going to have to beat the best teams to win it. If West Ham beat Manchester City you will have to say they have done a fantastic job. \"I watched Sunderland beat Chelsea the other night and not only are they fighting for Gus Poyet but he has also got them playing some good football. They controlled large parts of the game against Chelsea. They had some good possession. So it will be more difficult than people will imagine.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
