Time to make history,\u201d Lincoln Loud, a character on Nickelodeon\u2019s animated series Loud House, says in a clip from the show circulating on Twitter. He opens the front door to meet his best friend\u2019s parents \u2013 an interracial gay couple. Mr McBride and Mr McBride, as Loud calls them, will make their debut on Wednesday as the network\u2019s first married gay couple on the show. But it isn\u2019t the first time that Nickelodeon or kids\u2019 television has featured LGBT characters. Fans praised the show for its casual portrayal of the two dads, voiced by the comedians Wayne Brady and Michael McDonald. Rather than linger on their sexuality, the episode focused on their traits as overprotective parents. In the segment titled Overnight Success, the parents drop off their son for a sleepover with a humidifier, white noise machine, ear plugs, allergy medicine, a photo of the family and multiple phone numbers in case their cellphones fail. \u201cNo nuts, no gluten, no sugar and be careful with orange juice. You know how you get with pulp,\u201d Brady\u2019s character warns his son before leaving. The other Mr McBride laments tearfully: \u201cThey grow up so fast.\u201d When reached for comment on the show, a Nickelodeon spokesperson said the network would rather let the episode speak for itself. The spokesperson said the episode has already aired \u201cin some US markets (Asia, France, Italy), and this clip among others, as well as screen grabs from the series have been posted by fans around the world\u201d. Judging by responses on Twitter, the reaction to the show\u2019s new characters was overwhelmingly positive. \u201cThe Loud House has an unambiguous gay married couple that isn\u2019t an excuse for a punchline, God bless Nickelodeon,\u201d one user wrote. \u201cThank you Loud House, for these wonderful gay dads,\u201d tweeted another. Negative responses encouraged parents to forbid their children from watching the show or said the characters seemed forced. Loud House, which tells the story of a boy with ten sisters, premiered on Nickelodeon on 2 May. Variety reported that it pulled in 1.8 million viewers before it was renewed for a second season on 25 May. Other shows have shown LGBT characters and parents in the past. In 2005, the PBS show Postcards from Buster, which showed the rabbit from the cartoon Arthur interacting with real kids, pulled an episode which depicted gay parents, according to the Associated Press. The show\u2019s last episode aired in 2012. On Disney Channel, the live-action show Good Luck Charlie, which aired from 2010 to 2014, featured lesbian parents in an episode in its final season and faced backlash from conservative group One Million Moms. Cartoon Network\u2019s current animated series Clarence, which debuted in April 2014, featured a gay couple kissing on the cheek \u2013 though reports state that the kiss was censored and originally intended to be on the lips. Later episodes of the show featured Jeff, a friend of the titular character, and his two moms, EJ and Sue. In the past, Nickelodeon and other networks have featured characters which were confirmed to be part of the LGBT community by creators or actors off screen. Mike DiMartino, cocreator of Nickelodeon\u2019s The Legend of Korra, confirmed on his website in February 2014 that two of the show\u2019s female characters were in a relationship. The series ran from 2012 to 2014. Olivia Olsen, a voice actor from Cartoon Network\u2019s Adventure Time, told fans that two female characters were once in a relationship. With the introduction of the McBrides, Loud House joins a recent wave of diverse programming including Nickelodeon\u2019s Sanjay and Craig, featuring a biracial Indian boy and his pet snake, and Disney\u2019s Doc McStuffins, a show about an African American girl who fixes her stuffed animals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
