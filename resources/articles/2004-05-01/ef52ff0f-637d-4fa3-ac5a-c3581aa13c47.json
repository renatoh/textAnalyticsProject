Is it a hospital? Seaham Hall has a slightly sinister aspect on arrival, although the views over the north-east coal coast are second to none. What are the rooms like? Big, with lovely windows and Kenzo furnishings. There's a jar of jelly beans for sweetie moments, and an exceptionally sophisticated TV system; you change channel by using a new-age kind of console, which also allows you play CDs and DVDs through the TV. You think that's complicated ... until you see the lighting, which is simply the most baffling lighting system ever invented. You have at least 30 different little buttons to press - their function a mystery. The bed test: Firm and cosy; sheets beautiful white cotton. The best thing: The spa. Seaham Hall's Serenity Spa, designed along feng shui principles (even if it's bogus, the place feels serene) has a beautiful pool, hammam, outdoor Jacuzzi and steam room plus a range of massages and facials. I had a really brilliant Elemis massage from a therapist who knew what she was doing (from \u00a330). There's also a decent gym and a great studio with fun classes (but book ahead; the gym is popular with non-guests.) The pool is very much for lounging around, though, so forget doing those laps. The worst thing: The underground tunnel between hotel and spa is seen as a feature by the hotel, but I found it a little dank and eerie. And I could have done without the otherwise friendly staff referring to Lord Byron (who got married in the building) as a \"pervert\" because of his affection for the same sex. The bathroom: Great: roomy, with an enormous walk-in shower, fashionable granite, good towels, Molton Brown. The restaurant: There are two: one in the spa, another in the hotel. The brasserie in the spa serves delicious Thai food; but is Thai really what you want at lunchtime in a spa? In the hotel, the restaurant is high fine dining with prices to match; exceptional desserts. What is there to see within walking distance? Seaham is a small ex-mining town; there are interesting sculptures and murals along the coast to lost miners - some of whom were lost at sea, since the mines went far out under the waves. The shore has been cleaned up in recent years and is great for a walk or jog. And the medieval church next to Seaham Hall is as sweet as you could imagine. How much a night? Rooms from \u00a3175 a night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
