But the MP is now prime minister and the former waitress, his wife, face allegations over their finances that could topple the Czech government. Stanislav Gross, 35, Europe's youngest prime minister, is facing calls for his resignation over the source of the money he used to buy a luxury flat in Prague. He originally said he used his own salary, savings and a mortgage to buy the dwelling but later conceded his uncle had lent him a \u00a328,000 deposit. The prime minister bought the \u00a397,000 flat in the Barrandov district of Prague when he was on a monthly salary of \u00a3692. It then emerged his uncle, who had said he obtained the money from relatives abroad, had borrowed it from a former journalist he scarcely knew. Mr Gross denies wrongdoing and has threatened to sue his accusers. He is also facing questions over how his wife, Sarka, received a loan for a property deal from a woman suspected of insurance fraud. After a meeting today with the Czech president, Vaclav Klaus, aimed at bringing the crisis to an end, Mr Gross, who leads Social Democratic party, said the governing coalition might no longer be stable enough to rule. The Christian Democrats, a junior coalition partner, are insisting the prime minister step down in order to restore credibility to the governmen, but Mr Gross has instead called on the Christian Democrats to leave the cabinet. \"It is clear that with the standpoint of the Christian Democrats ... it is impossible to continue seeking a solution on the basis [of the current coalition],\" he said in a radio interview. Mr Gross is meeting the Christian Democratic leader, Miroslav Kalousek, today. If he does push the junior partner out of the three-party coalition - the third member is the rightwing Freedom Union - he will lose his majority of 101 seats in the 200 seat lower house of parliament. With a premiership echoing the Hugh Grant-Martine McCutcheon plot in the Richard Curtis film Love Actually, where the prime minister falls in love with a Downing Street tea lady, the affair has gripped the Czech public. Polls show 61% of the electorate want Mr Gross to resign. If the coalition loses its majority, it would have to seek support from the Communist party to survive a no-confidence vote, potentially bringing the party into government for the first time since the 1989 velvet revolution. The next election is due in mid-2006, and calling an early ballot is difficult under the Czech constitution."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
