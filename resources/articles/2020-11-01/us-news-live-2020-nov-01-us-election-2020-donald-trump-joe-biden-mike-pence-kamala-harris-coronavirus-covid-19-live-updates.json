Thanks for following along \u2013 we\u2019ve launched a new US politics blog at the link below. I\u2019ll be teleporting over to the global coronavirus blog here so long: Almost an hour past Miami-Dade\u2019s coronavirus curfew, Trump has finished speaking but has taken his time leaving \u2013 he danced and clapped along to the song \u201cYMCA\u201d as usual. Trump is still speaking \u2013 I\u2019m keeping an ear out for anythinf he hasn\u2019t said many times before \u2013 but in the meantime here is a summary of the last few hours for those of you just tuning in: A reminder that if there\u2019s something I\u2019ve missed you can find me on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Trump threatened to fire Dr Fauci. At Opa-Locka airport in the Miami area, a \u201cFire Fauci\u201d chant broke out when Trump defended his handling of coronavirus. Anthony Fauci, a highly respected member of his coronavirus task force, has been increasingly critical of Trump\u2019s handling of the virus. In response to the \u201cFire Fauci\u201d chant, Trump said: \u201cDon\u2019t tell anybody, but let me wait until a little bit after the election.\u201d Trump broke a curfew at rally in Miami-Dade county. Trump spoke until well after midnnight in Miami-Dade county, breaking a coronavirus cufew intended to mitigate infections. A \u201cnon-scalable\u201d fence will be erected around the White House compound \u2013 report. \u201cA federal law enforcement source tells NBC that beginning tomorrow, crews will build a \u201cnon-scalable\u201d fence to secure the WH complex, Ellipse and Lafayette Square,\u201d NBC White House correspondent Geoff Bennet tweeted. The FBI confirmed on Sunday that it was investigating the Biden bus incident, in which a convoy of vehicles flying flags in support of President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election bid surrounded a bus carrying campaign staff for Democratic challenger Joe Biden on a Texas highway. Harris: Election results \u2018will determine our moral direction for years to come\u2019. Kamala Harris said in remarks recorded for a Biden campaign virtual gospel concert Sunday evening that the election results \u201cwill determine our moral direction for years to come.\u201d Neither Harris nor Obama mentioned Trump at the event, but alluded to the president\u2019s sometimes racist rhetoric and divisive policies. Donald Trump denied he plans to declare victory prematurely on election night, hours after Axios reported that he was. Standing on an airport tarmac at Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina, Trump was asked about the report. \u201cNo, no, that\u2019s a false report,\u201d he said. The Trump administratuon is \u201cwoefully behind\u201d when it comes to stockpiling gloves and that the country\u2019s Strategic National Stockpile, NBC News reported. Biden in Philadelphia: \u2018We\u2019re seeing race-based disparities in every aspect of this virus\u2019. Biden participated in a \u201csouls to the polls\u201d event, where he said \u201cEvery single day we\u2019re seeing race-based disparities in every aspect of this virus,\u201d shouting to be heard over the blaring car horns. He declared that Trump\u2019s handling of Covid-19 was \u201calmost criminal\u201d and that the pandemic was a \u201cmass casualty event in the Black community.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s campaign rallies may have led to 30,000 additional confirmed cases of Covid-19, and likely resulted in more than 700 deaths overall, according to a Stanford University paper posted online this weekend. The Texas supreme court denied a challenge to 127,000 votes cast via drive-thru in Harris County. Republicans have claimed in state and federal court that the votes should be considered illegal because voters used drive-thru polling sites. Axios, citing three anonymous sources, said Donald Trump plans to ignore the actual results of the election and declare victory if the early results show him \u201cahead.\u201d Analysts were quick to point out that a person can say \u201cI win\u201d as many times as they want, but it doesn\u2019t make it true. More on Trump threatening to Fire Dr Fauci. At Opa-Locka airport in the Miami area, a \u201cFire Fauci\u201d chant broke out when Trump defended his handling of coronavirus. Anthony Fauci, a highly respected member of his coronavirus task force, has been increasingly critical of Trump\u2019s handling of the virus. In response to the \u201cFire Fauci\u201d chant, Trump said: \u201cDon\u2019t tell anybody, but let me wait until a little bit after the election.\u201d Here is the clip of Trump threatening to fire Dr Fauci: Trump has again defended the supporters who surrounded Biden\u2019s campaign bus, saying that they \u2018escorted\u2019 the bus: As trump criticised the US top infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci, the crowd began to chant, \u201cFire Fauci! Fire Fauci!\u201d. Trump responded: \u201cDon\u2019t tell anybody, but let me wait \u2018til a little bit after the election, please. I appreciate the advice.\u201d Trump just said \u201cwe could tay here all night.\u201d \u201cI could stay here and tell you stories all night,\u201d he continues. Trump is speaking past a coronavirus cufew intended to mitigate infections as a Stanford University study shows his campaign rallies may have led to 30,000 additional confirmed cases of Covid-19, and likely resulted in more than 700 deaths overall. The new research analyzed data following 18 Trump rallies held between 20 June and 22 September. Trump and is supporters are now officially out after the Miami-Dade curfew cutoff of midnight. Trump hasn\u2019t mentioned it, but he has just said, \u201cIs there any place you\u2019d rather be than at a Trump rally?\u201d \u201cBiden is a globalist who spent four years... sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars,\u201d says Trump. He goes on to stress that he is \u201can outsider\u201d. \u201cIf I don\u2019t sound like a typical Washington politician it\u2019s because I\u2019m not a politician,\u201d he says. Trump has taken the stage with seven minutes left to the county curfew: Back to Miami \u2013 there are just ten minutes left before Miami-Dade\u2019s coronavirus curfew comes into effect. The county (the same one in which Trump is due to speak any moment) has a countywide curfew from midnight to 6am every day as a precaution against coronavirus infections. Here is that clip from earlier on Sunday, when Trump said he\u2019s preparing for legal challenges to the counting of mail and absentee votes in Pennsylvania. Speaking to reporters in Charlotte ahead of a rally in Hickory, North Carolina, Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019re going in the night of - as soon as the election is over - we\u2019re going in with our lawyers.\u201d Trump has repeatedly attacked the Supreme Court in recent days for not blocking the counting of late arriving ballots for days after election day: Back at the Trump rally in Miami: Trump is preparing to land in Miami. As we wait for him to take the stage, here is more on the incredible early voting figures. 8% more Texans have already voted this year than the total last year. According to the latest YouGov poll, Trump leads by 2% in Texas: More on Texans voting early from our story last week: The numbers are propelling what is historically one of the lowest voter turnout states to the top of the nation\u2019s leaderboard in terms of the sheer number of people who have voted thus far. That groundswell of participation is even more striking in context, as democratic hurdles remain ever-present at the polls while fears of Covid-19 also loom large: Here useful thread on the timing of the election for Australians \u2013 the complete thread can be found on Twitter. Trump has tweeted about the second ammendment, or the right to bear arms, saying, falsely, that Biden will repeal this. A reminder that Trump is sayning this in a year where Americans have bought 17m guns \u2013 more than any other year \u2013 and even Walmart has taken guns off its shelves ahead of the election over fears of unrest. Citing \u201cthe current unrest\u201d, Walmart removed guns and ammunition from display in stores last week, as a \u201cprecaution\u201d against theft if stores are robbed, the Wall Street Journal reported. The retailer did not confirm when firearms and ammunition would be put back on display but said that customers could continue to buy guns and ammunition by request. Stepping away from that rally for a moment: The number of people who have voted early in the US this year has passed 93.2m. The total number of people who voted in 2016 was 138.8m. This means roughly 67% of the total voter turnout for 2016 has already voted this year: Here is a clip of DeSantis speaking just now: More from DeSantis in Florida: Florida governor Ron DeSantis has taken the statge, too. He just said: \u201cWe are not going to allow Kamala Harris to be the president of the United States.\u201d \u201cWhen we had the riots, we didn\u2019t waste any time, I called up the national guard and said it\u2019s not going to happen here.\u201d Kimberley Guildfoyle was first opening act - she spoke about her Puerto Rican heritage and ended her speech with the same refrain from her now infamous RNC speech: \u201cThe best is yet to come.\u201d Back to Miami, where the Guardian\u2019s Southern Bureau Chief is at the Trump rally. US senator for Florida Marco Rubio has just spoken: And on the topic of polls \u2013 and, specifically, FiveThirtyEight polls, the website\u2019s editror Nate Silver published a worthwile piece this evening in the US on how Trump could still win. Here\u2019s some of what he has to say: The reasons that President Trump\u2019s chances in our forecast are about 10 percent and not zero: As in 2016, Trump could potentially benefit from the Electoral College. Projected margins in the tipping-point states are considerably tighter than the margins in the national popular vote. More specifically, Joe Biden\u2019s lead in Pennsylvania \u2014 the most likely tipping-point state, according to our forecast \u2014 is solid but not spectacular: about 5 points in our polling average. Without Pennsylvania, Biden does have some paths to victory, but there\u2019s no one alternative state he can feel especially secure about. While a lot of theories about why Trump can win (e.g., those about \u201cshy\u201d Trump voters) are probably wrong, systematic polling errors do occur, and it\u2019s hard to predict them ahead of time or to anticipate the reasons in advance. There is some chance that Trump could \u201cwin\u201d illegitimately. To a large extent, these scenarios are beyond the scope of our forecast. There\u2019s also some chance of a recount (about 4 percent) or an Electoral College tie (around 0.5 percent), according to our forecast. Data journalism website FiveThirtyEight published its latest polling moments ago. It has Biden far, far ahead \u2013 by 8.6 points. Polling has of course let us down in the past \u2013 but this margin is huge even compared to Clinton in 2016. Two days out from the election she was 2.8 points ahead. Trump will be speaking live in Miami in just under an hour\u2019s time \u2013 my colleague Oliver Laughland is on the ground and will be bringing us the latest: Harris used remarks recorded for a Biden campaign virtual gospel concert Sunday evening to frame this election year as \u201ca time to honestly grapple with what our faith requires of us\u201d and \u201cwhat it means to live the values it teaches,\u201d AP reports. She said the results \u201cwill determine our moral direction for years to come.\u201d Neither Harris nor Obama mentioned Trump, but alluded to the president\u2019s sometimes racist rhetoric and divisive policies. Speaking of ballots \u2013 Trump said at his rally in Rome that \u201cEverything has to be counted by the evening of our election day...If they want more time, let them put their ballots in early\u201d. As the Associated Press\u2019s Zeke Miller points out, vote-counting always takes longer than election day: The US Postal Service (USPS) must remind senior managers they must follow its \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d policy and use its Express Mail Network to expedite ballots ahead of Tuesday\u2019s presidential election, under an order signed by a US judge. Reuters: US District Judge Emmet Sullivan\u2019s order on Sunday, to which the USPS agreed, said the postal service must reinforce its \u201cspecial procedures\u201d to ensure it \u201cdelivers every ballot possible by the cutoff time on Election Day.\u201d USPS will also reinforce to managers that \u201call ballots with a local destination must be cleared and processed on the same day or no later than the next morning for delivery to local offices, from now through at least November 7.\u201d Sullivan, of US District Court in Washington, on Friday had ordered USPS to adopt \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d at numerous processing locations to ensure the timely delivery of millions of ballots before Tuesday\u2019s presidential election. Here are the latest YouGov poll results \u2013 they show Biden with a lead of 4% in North Carolina and 8% in Pennsylvania. He leads by 2% in Florida and 1% in Georgia. Trump leads by 2% in Texas: Here is what that Trump rally in Georgia was like for one CNN reporter: Today\u2019s US elections podcast focusses on the voters who are sticking with Trump: A reminder that you can get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. As Trump wraps up in Atlanta, my colleague Oliver Laughland has just arrived at the Trump rally in Miami \u2013 where Trump is due to speak in two hours\u2019 time. Florida has been a reliable bellwether in recent elections. The southern state has a diverse population, but is generally conservative-leaning and has a high proportion of older voters. Both camps will see this as a must-win state \u2013 and Biden currently leads by 1.9 points in the polls. NBC White House correspondent reports, citing an unnamed federal law enforcement source, that starting on Monday 2 November, a \u201cnon-scalable\u201d fence will be erected around the White House compound. Here is what we know so far about the FBI confirming on Sunday that it was investigating the incident in which a convoy of vehicles flying flags in support of President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election bid surrounded a bus carrying campaign staff for Democratic challenger Joe Biden on a Texas highway. \u201cFBI San Antonio is aware of the incident and investigating,\u201d special agent Michelle Lee, a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in San Antonio, told Reuters in an email. \u201cNo further information is available at this time.\u201d Speaking about the incident on the campaign trail on Sunday in Philadelphia, Biden said: \u201cWe\u2019ve never had anything like this. At least we\u2019ve never had a president who thinks it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Neither Biden nor his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, was aboard the bus. The Texas Tribune reported that its passengers included Democratic US House of Representatives candidate and former Texas state Senator Wendy Davis. New Orleans\u2019 Democratic mayor and Louisiana\u2019s Republican secretary of state argued Sunday over who\u2019s responsible for providing generators if some polling places didn\u2019t have electricity on Election Day, AP reports, but by the end of the day it appeared all polling stations would have power. Mayor LaToya Cantrell said Sunday that up to 11 precincts in the city could still be without power Tuesday, nearly a week after Hurricane Zeta took down power lines. She said Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin and his commissioner of elections, Sherri Wharton Hadskey, \u201care refusing to provide support for generators\u201d for those precincts. \u201cIn failing to fulfill its duty, the Secretary of State\u2019s office risks disenfranchising Orleans residents and threatens to suppress the vote,\u201d Cantrell said in a news release. Ardoin responded in his own news release Sunday: \u201cIt is unfortunate that politicians like Mayor Cantrell ... have responded to Hurricane Zeta by trying to score cheap political points instead of being part of any solution.\u201d Cantrell said the Secretary of State\u2019s office \u201chas taken the unprecedented position\u201d that the city of New Orleans must use its employees and money to provide generators for polling places. Ardoin issued a statement Saturday saying that Louisiana polling places without power would receive generators for Election Day, but it did not specify whether providing the generators would be a state or local responsibility. A spokesman for Ardoin\u2019s office did not immediately provide a response to questions about it from The Associated Press on Sunday. Later Sunday, the city issued a statement saying that Energy New Orleans was now estimating that three polling stations could be without power Tuesday \u2014 down from the 11 earlier estimated. Portable generators and lighting for two of the locations was being provided by the Governor\u2019s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness and the Secretary of State\u2019s Office, and Entergy New Orleans would provide the generator for the third site, the statement said. Entergy would transport and operate the generators provided by the state to the other two locations, the city said. The city was expecting that all original polling places would be in operation come Tuesday. New Yorker staff writer Jelani Cobb on Trump\u2019s response to the Biden bus incident: According to the Covid Tracking Project, the US reported 74,000 new coronavirus cases on Sunday \u2013 10,000 more than a week earlier. \u201cYou people are going to vote mostly on election day?\u201d says Trump to cheers from the crowd. \u201cThat\u2019s called the red wave\u201d \u201cThis is going to be the most important election in my opinion because our country can never be a socialist country in my opinion.\u201d He then promises to \u201cmass distribute the vaccine in just a few short weeks\u201d. This vaccine does not yet exist. Then he tells a bizarre story: When his 14-year-old son Baron tested positive for coronavirus, he says, the doctor said he would be fine, because he is such a strong young man. A few minutes later, Trump says, he asked how Baron was doing and the doctor said he was all better. Trump is talking about the Hunter Biden laptop story. \u201cAdam Schiff says the laptop was created by Russia. We are so screwed up,\u201d says Trump. Then he starts talking about his MAGA hat \u2013 which he\u2019s wearing because there\u2019s \u201ca lotta wind\u201d. He had wanted to show off is hair, he says. The Hill journalist John Kruzel reports that a federal judge has ordered that from Monday 2 November to Wednesday 4 Novemner, the US Postal Service must \u201cprovide daily updates on the alleged election mail backlog at the Miami-Dade Country Post Office\u201d: We\u2019ll bring you the latest: NBC News reports that the Trump administratuon is \u201cwoefully behind\u201d when it comes to stockpiling gloves and that the country\u2019s Strategic National Stockpile \u2013 which is itself meant to the the country\u2019s last resort for the crucial personal protective equipment \u2013 is \u201crunning dangerously low\u201d: [Health and Human Services] set a goal to have on hand a 90-day supply in the stockpile, or 4.5 billion gloves. But as of this week it had 2 million, according to department officials. The department estimates the current demand to be at 8.7 billion a month, or 104 billion gloves per year. Here are some photos of election night 1984, when Reagan won, in the USA Today newsroom: Here is Arizona Republican Party chairwoman Dr Kelli Ward on how Trump is doing with suburban women \u2013 some of whom, she says, have veeb \u201cbrainwashed\u201d by the media: Kamala Harris was in Georgia, a longtime Republican stronghold that Democrats believe could flip if Black voters show up in force. She encouraged a racially diverse crowd in a rapidly growing Atlanta suburb to \u201chonor the ancestors\u201d by voting, invoking the memory of the late civil rights legend, longtime Rep. John Lewis. Biden hasn\u2019t responded to Trump\u2019s recent comment on the supporters who surrounded one of the Democratic nominee\u2019s campaign buses. But he did just tweet this: Joe Biden is in Philadelphia today, as he focusses in his final days of campaign on appealing to Black supporters to vote in-person. Philadelphia is the largest city in Pennsylvania \u2013 which is emerging as the most hotly contested battleground in the closing 48 hours of the campaign, AP reports. Biden participated in a \u201csouls to the polls\u201d event that is part of a nationwide effort to organize Black churchgoers to vote. \u201cEvery single day we\u2019re seeing race-based disparities in every aspect of this virus,\u201d Biden said at the drive-in event, shouting to be heard over the blaring car horns. He declared that Trump\u2019s handling of Covid-19 was \u201calmost criminal\u201d and that the pandemic was a \u201cmass casualty event in the Black community.\u201d As early voting closes in New York City, the board of elections have published the numbers: Some reaction now to Trump\u2019s defence of the Biden bus incident: As Trump tweets his support of those \u201cpatriots\u201d other Trump supporters have blocked main roads in New York and New Jersey, according to the New York Times. The Times reports that, \u201cCaravans of President Trump\u2019s supporters blockaded the Mario M. Cuomo Bridge and the Garden State Parkway on Sunday, snarling traffic on two of the busiest highways in the New York metropolitan area just two days before Election Day.\u201d Democrat state senator David Carlucci, who represents Rockland County, responded on Twitter, calling the behaviour \u201caggressive, dangerous and reckless\u201d: Trump has just tweeted again about the Biden bus incident, saying, \u201cIn my opinion these patriots did nothing wrong.\u201d Trump also suggested the FBI should stop investigating the incident, in which his supporters were seen surrounding a Biden campaign bus in Texas, which led Democrats to cancel an event there. The president\u2019s tweet came hours after the FBI confirmed that it was \u201caware of the incident and investigating.\u201d This interview with a nurse in Montana is well worth watching if you haven\u2019t seen it. \u201cYou know at first, I hesitate to tell you this but I was the nurse for the very first patient that passed from Covid in our hospital. I thought I\u2019ve seen this before,\u201d says nurse Joey Traywick. \u201cI\u2019ll come back and check on her regularly. At that point she was moderately lucid. And I came back to the room at one point and she had passed. By herself. And I thought I\u2019m never going to let that happen again.\u201d He has since been with 23 patients when they have died from coronavirus. \u201cI\u2019m a good nurse. And the nurses that I work with are good nurses, but we are broken.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m broken. And my colleagues are broken. And people say It\u2019s not that big a deal and I want to take them by the collar and say, \u2018You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Hi, Helen Sullivan joining you now from Sydney, where it is already Monday, 2 November \u2013 and therefore a day out from the election. Yikes! I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest from accross the US for the next few hours. Please do get in touch with news from your part of the country, questions, comments and anything you think may be of interest to other readers. Twitter: @helenrsullivan Email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com. Bloomberg reports on the mixed-messaging about Covid-19 inside the White House: Donald Trump told his then-chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to \u201cstay the hell home\u201d from a trip to India in February because he didn\u2019t want to be around Mulvaney and his lingering cough, according to people familiar with the trip. Even before the virus, Trump was known to dart to the other side of the room if someone sneezed. He used medical wipes labeled \u201cnot for use on skin\u201d to scrub his hands, along with the ever-present Purell. Yet at the White House he shunned one of the simplest and most effective ways of preventing transmission \u2013 wearing a mask. \u201cTake that fucking thing off,\u201d he demanded more than once to aides who showed up wearing masks in the early days of the virus, when he\u2019d been told they weren\u2019t a fail-safe. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d Fascinating opinion piece in the Washington Post by leading Republican election lawyer, Benjamin L Ginsberg. Ginsberg writes that Trump\u2019s last-minute attempt to challenge the ballots of individual voters unlikely to support him is as \u201cun-American as it gets.\u201d These are painful words for me to write. I spent four decades in the Republican trenches, representing GOP presidential and congressional campaigns, working on Election Day operations, recounts, redistricting and other issues, including trying to lift the consent decree... The truth is that over all those years Republicans found only isolated incidents of fraud. Proof of systematic fraud has become the Loch Ness Monster of the Republican Party. People have spent a lot of time looking for it, but it doesn\u2019t exist. As he confronts losing, Trump has devoted his campaign and the Republican Party to this myth of voter fraud. Absent being able to articulate a cogent plan for a second term or find an attack against Joe Biden that will stick, disenfranchising enough voters has become key to his reelection strategy. American voters with limited English proficiency could be decisive in battleground states, but are not getting the support they need to vote, according to an analysis by Philadelphia public radio station WHYY: Language support guaranteed under Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act kicks in when a critical mass of voters requires it. The law says that officials should offer translated election-related information, and bilingual poll workers, if their election jurisdiction (typically states and counties) has at least 5 percent eligible voters or 10,000 voters \u2014 whichever is less \u2014 with limited English proficiency in a single language group. Pennsylvania isn\u2019t the only state where thousands of such \u201clanguage minority\u201d voters are left to fend for themselves because they live in jurisdictions where section 203 does not apply. The gaps in language support are wider than the 2016 presidential victory margins in Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and New Hampshire, according to our analysis of Census data. Across the country, that\u2019s about 2.7 million eligible voters. And this year, even more American citizens could be disenfranchised by language barriers as vote-by-mail goes mainstream in an unprecedented way. On the ground reality suggests that the scenario may be more drastic than what the data alone indicates. Election officials have failed to translate ballots, recruit bilingual poll workers and distribute multilingual voter education materials even in jurisdictions where the law does apply, says James Tucker, a voting-rights attorney and expert on language-minority groups\u2019 right to the ballot. In Donald Trump\u2019s denial that he will declare victory prematurely, he also threatened to deploy his team of lawyers to challenge the results. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go in the night of, as soon as that election\u2019s over, we\u2019re going in with our lawyers,\u201d Trump said. He continued to say he opposed the supreme court decision to allow ballots to be counted even if they arrive after election day. A professor of law and political science at UC Irvine, Rick Hasen, said the suggestion Trump would pursue a \u201cscorched-earth litigation strategy\u201d was preferable to Trump declaring the race early. \u201cFrankly it beats the alternative (which was Trump just declaring victory even if the race was too early to call),\u201d Hasen tweeted. Donald Trump has denied he plans to declare victory prematurely on election night, hours after Axios reported that he was. Standing on an airport tarmac at Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina, Trump was asked about the report. \u201cNo, no, that\u2019s a false report,\u201d he said. Trump then quickly moved on to talk about his opposition to ballots being counted after election day. \u201cI think it\u2019s a terrible thing when ballots can be collected after an election,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a terrible thing when states are allowed to tabulate ballots for a long period of time after the election is over.\u201d He continued: \u201cI think it\u2019s terrible that we can\u2019t know the results of an election the night of the election. ... We\u2019re going to go in the night of, as soon as that election\u2019s over, we\u2019re going in with our lawyers.\u201d Again I will highlight this New York Times article: We Have Never Had Final Results on Election Day. Trump responds to the question around the 1:22 mark in this video: \u201cIt was less licence to kill and more dramatic licence,\u201d write the Guardian\u2019s Martin Belam and Libby Brooks, regarding Donald Trump\u2019s claim that the late Sean Connery assisted him in securing the land for a golf course in Scotland: In 2008 Connery is reported as saying of the project: \u201cDuring tough economic times, this is a major vote of confidence in Scotland\u2019s tourist industry and our ability to rise to the challenge. I look forward to seeing a new gem in the north-east that is good for Aberdeenshire and good for Scotland.\u201d But Martin Ford, the Aberdeenshire councillor who was chair of the planning committee that initially refused Trump\u2019s application to build the resort, told the Guardian: \u201cMr Connery was not involved in the due process that led to the granting of planning permission for a golf resort at Menie. He did not submit a letter of representation to the council, appear at the planning hearing, or at the public local inquiry.\u201d Ford added: \u201cOpinions offered in press articles are not material considerations in decisions on planning applications.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s campaign rallies may have led to 30,000 additional confirmed cases of Covid-19, and likely resulted in more than 700 deaths overall, according to a Stanford University paper posted online this weekend. The Texas supreme court denied a challenge to 127,000 votes cast via drive-thru in Harris County. Republicans have claimed in state and federal court that the votes should be considered illegal because voters used drive-thru polling sites. Axios, citing three anonymous sources, said Donald Trump plans to ignore the actual results of the election and declare victory if the early results show him \u201cahead.\u201d Analysts were quick to point out that a person can say \u201cI win\u201d as many times as they want, but it doesn\u2019t make it true. A controversial member of Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus task force, Scott Atlas, apologized this morning for doing an interview with a news outlet registered as an agent of a foreign government in the US, RT. Sobering read in Politico about how Donald Trump could win re-election, despite consistent polling in Joe Biden\u2019s favor. Jeff Roe, the Republican strategist who steered Ted Cruz\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, told Politico: \u201cFor as bad as all this shit is, you can certainly see how he could win.\u201d It\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d resting on a tower of uncertainties \u2014 explosive Republican turnout on Election Day, including among new, same-day registrants; tepid enthusiasm for Biden, especially among young people of color; disruptions at polling places that depress Democratic turnout; legal victories related to ballot counting; and a full-on embrace of Trump by the few voters who remain undecided. Trump will need most or all of those things to happen in multiple states to engineer a victory, according to interviews with more than a dozen Democratic and Republican strategists and campaign officials. But as they run their final simulations of the Electoral College map, they see a credible \u2014 if distant \u2014 opportunity for a surprise. In 2017, two former officials linked to the office of New Jersey\u2019s governor at the time, Chris Christie, were sentenced for using their power to close lanes on the George Washington Bridge in 2013 in an act of political revenge known as Bridgegate. Traffic has stopped in New Jersey again for political reasons: a motorcade of Donald Trump supporters stopping their vehicles on the Garden State Parkway. Officials at the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, which runs the Parkway, confirmed the event took place to the news website NJ.com. Donald Trump\u2019s administration did not take the most basic steps to track a Covid-19 outbreak at the White House and has in general provided little information about its spread among senior government officials including the president. But the New York Times has just revealed it had geneticists determine the genetic sequence of viruses that infected two of its journalists believed to have been exposed in their work covering the White House. The Times reports: The White House has not disclosed any effort to conduct similar genetic testing, but the study\u2019s results show that it is still possible, even weeks after positive tests. Additional sequencing could help establish the path of the virus through the White House, the role of a possible super-spreading event for Judge Amy Coney Barrett and the origin of an outbreak among the staff of Vice President Mike Pence in the last week or so. Scenes from the final weekend before election day More from Adam Gabbatt in Trumbull county, Ohio \u2013 one of nine counties which flipped from voting for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 to backing Trump in 2016: Trump, more than Biden, desperately needs to win here given his reported struggles elsewhere in the mid-west. Happily, his supporters think he will. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a landslide. An absolute landslide,\u201d said Sean Delaney. He was carrying a particularly big flag which had a drawing of two guns on it. \u201cYou can hear the horns. This is crazy.\u201d Delaney rubbished polling which suggests Trump will not win in a landslide. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be just like last time. He\u2019s gonna blow it out of the water. I think the media is misrepresenting it.\u201d Christy Conde stood next to Delaney. She is a rare \u2013 at least in terms of people I\u2019ve met \u2013 Trump supporter who was happy to criticize the president. \u201cI like Trump even though I don\u2019t like Trump. He\u2019s so tacky. The debates were a debacle, he doesn\u2019t know how to shut up,\u201d Conde, 45, said. As a lifelong Democrat, what Conde does like about Trump is that under him manufacturing jobs \u201care coming back\u201d. Rust Belt states such as Ohio have suffered in recent decades as manufacturing and steel plants, and coal mines, have shut down. Trump has claimed he \u201cbrought back 700,000 [manufacturing] jobs\u201d, which is a lie, and suggested Obama and Biden \u201cbrought back nothing\u201d. Neither of those things are true, but among some, at least, it seems like that doesn\u2019t matter. At a rally in Iowa today, Donald Trump said that it is unusual for the US to not get election results on election night - even though it is very much normal. This comes after reports that Trump plans to declare victory before the election is called if it looks like he\u2019s ahead. The president may also want to read the New York Times article: We Have Never Had Final Results on Election Day. Important opinion piece in CNN by election law experts Richard Pildes and Richard Hasen about concerns the news media and social media might overplay routine election mistakes: With commentators floating the possibility of a Constitutional crisis, a civil war, breaches in our electronic voting machines and other worst-case scenarios, hyper-vigilant voters and the media must be careful not to undermine our elections by giving excessive play to typical, Election Day problems or hastily spreading viral posts before the facts are verified. In our polarized, frayed-nerves society, there\u2019s a serious possibility that minor issues will be blown out of proportion and cast in sinister terms, especially on social media. Our advice (to both voters and the media) is to slow down, take everything you see or hear with a grain of salt until it is fully vetted, and keep a balanced perspective on the problems that do emerge. We can say with near-certainty given what has happened in past elections, for example, that there will be reports of an electronic voting machine \u201cflipping\u201d votes from Trump to Biden or vice versa. A voter will choose one candidate on the touch screen, but the machine will record it as selecting another. This is typically the result of a calibration error and can be easily fixed by rebooting the machine. But a grainy social media video of a vote flip from one candidate to another can feed into the worst fears of an organized effort to steal or hack the election. More on the effort by some Republicans in Texas to void more than 100,000 votes which have been cast in Harris County. A state court denied the challenge, which is also being heard in federal court. The Republicans are arguing the votes should not count in the election because they were cast at drive-thru polling stations. Buzzfeed\u2019s Molly Hensley-Clancy visited one of these polling sites yesterday and said officials were surprised by the legal challenge because Republicans had been involved in the conception and design of the drive-thrus: \u201cThe official told me that the drive-through centers had been especially helpful for parents with young kids,\u201d Hensley-Clancy tweeted. \u201cParents told him it was so much easier to vote when the kids were buckled in and occupied in the back seat.\u201d A controversial member of Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus task force, Scott Atlas, apologized this morning for doing an interview with a news outlet registered as an agent of a foreign government in the US, RT. RT has close ties to the Russian government and is seen by some as Russian propaganda. The former CIA director, James Clapper, called it: \u201ca mouthpiece of Russian governmental propaganda.\u201d Atlas, who has no background in infectious diseases, has misleadingly called into question the efficacy of masks and social distancing and has supported the purposeful contraction of the virus by young people to create so-called \u201cherd immunity\u201d. Axios, citing three anonymous sources, is reporting that Donald Trump plans to ignore the actual results of the election and declare victory if the early results show him \u201cahead.\u201d Trump has privately talked through this scenario in some detail in the last few weeks, describing plans to walk up to a podium on election night and declare he has won. For this to happen, his allies expect he would need to either win or have commanding leads in Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, Texas, Iowa, Arizona and Georgia. In response to a request for comment, Trump campaign\u2019s communications director, Tim Murtaugh, told Axios: \u201cThis is nothing but people trying to create doubt about a Trump victory. When he wins, he\u2019s going to say so.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Adam Gabbatt is reporting from Ohio ahead of the election: Roadside flag-waving seems like a political tradition as old as time. There\u2019s a bunch of Trump-supporters here in Warren, Ohio, doing it right now. They\u2019re getting a few honks as they waggle their MAGA flags around, but... what exactly are they hoping to achieve? \u201cThat\u2019s a good point,\u201d said Harold Mechling, 75. He\u2019s holding a \u2018Trump 2020\u2019 sign which is a little tattered \u2013 a legacy, Mechling said, of him flying it on several boat trips. \u201cI guess I do this to support that good man. [Trump].\u201d Mechling, dressed in a black leather jacket, black jeans, and black cowboy boots, is here with his wife, Debbie Mechling. She has brought a big speaker and is playing a song that is transparently a rip off of the Village People hit \u2018YMCA\u2019. The lyrics have been changed to M, A, G, A, and the flag-wavers are having a nice dance to the tune. Warren is in Trumbull county, one of nine counties which flipped from voting for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 to backing Trump in 2016. It was places like this that helped Trump win Ohio by eight points last time round, but recent polls have the president neck-and-neck with Joe Biden. The Texas supreme court has just denied a challenge to 127,000 votes cast via drive-thru in Harris County. Republicans have claimed in state and federal court that the votes should be considered illegal because voters used drive-thru polling sites. The federal challenge remains and will be considered in an emergency hearing on Monday. Two previous federal challenges tried to block drive-thru voting, but this challenge seeks to void votes cast at drive-thru polling sites. Austin American-Statesman reporter, Chuck Lindell, has been closely following this case, as well as other legal challenges to voting in Texas. Just as Joe Biden announced he would travel to Ohio the day before the election \u2013 an indication his campaign thinks he has a chance to win the state \u2013 the state\u2019s governor guessed Donald Trump would be declared the winner there. This morning, the state\u2019s Republican Governor, Mike DeWine, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union: \u201cI think the president wins Ohio. I think it\u2019s going to be a close vote. I think he wins by a couple points probably.\u201d Though it is likely vote counts will be delayed in battleground states because of the increase in mail-in votes, DeWine guessed that we\u2019ll know who won Ohio on election night. \u201cWe count our early votes right at 7:30,\u201d DeWine said. \u201cSo, you\u2019re going \u2013 the first votes you\u2019re going to get are all the early votes. They\u2019re going to come in probably before 8:00. And you\u2019re going to see some big numbers there. And I think that will give us some indication of how Ohio is going.\u201d And despite Trump\u2019s claims that votes which arrive after election day shouldn\u2019t be counted, DeWine said Ohio counts any vote which arrives within 10 days of the election, as long as its postmarked before election day. Absentee ballots can also can be submitted in a drop box required at each of the 88 county boards of elections. \u201cWe have got a very open voting,\u201d DeWine said. \u201cIt\u2019s a system that has worked.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s world affairs editor, Julian Borger, writes on Donald Trump and Joe Biden\u2019s sprint through campaign rallies in battleground states with just over 48 hours to go until voting concludes. The president began his morning in Michigan and Biden was due to appear in Pennsylvania today. Julian reports: In Michigan, Trump repeated some of the messages that worked in 2016, highlighting the impact of globalisation on the car industry. \u201cI gave you a lot of auto plants, so I think we\u2019re even,\u201d he told a crowd at a wind- and rain-swept rally in the town of Washington. One new car plant has been announced since Trump took office, while Michigan car and vehicle part manufacturing jobs had fallen by 2,400 even before the Covid-19 pandemic struck. Employment in the sector is down more than 18,000 in the state, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Biden has also just announced he will be in Ohio on Monday. A number of readers have pointed out there may be more than appears to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\u2019s decision to endorse a Republican presidential candidate for the first time since 1972. In 2018, the editorial boards of the Post-Gazette and the Toledo Blade merged when the Pittsburgh paper ended its daily print run. The result under editorial page editor Keith Burris and publisher John Robinson Block is a distinct right-ward shift in the paper\u2019s politics, culminating with Saturday\u2019s endorsement of Donald Trump. As one commenter put it: \u201cOut-of-state investors buy Primanti Bros, fire all the chefs &amp; line cooks, reopen with an all-vegetarian menu, and proclaim \u201cthis establishment, open since 1933, is convinced: no more meat!\u201d. Did some sort of persuasion take place? Nah, the new owners just kept the old signs.\u201d Block made headlines during the 2016 election cycle for a Facebook photo in which he shared a gushing post after hanging out on then-candidate Trump\u2019s jet. Biden campaign senior adviser Anita Dunn expressed confidence ahead of this week\u2019s election in an appearance on ABC\u2019s This Week with George Stephanopoulos, saying the Democratic candidate\u2019s map has \u201cexpanded\u201d in the final run-up to Tuesday. \u201cAs we\u2019ve got closer to the election, instead of the number of contested battleground states shrinking, which is normally what you see at this point in a campaign, George, you know that, the number has actually expanded so that we are now campaigning also in Georgia, in Iowa, in Ohio. Senator Harris was in Texas on Friday,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cOur map has expanded as we move closer to election day. \u201cAnd the Trump campaign \u2013 obviously, they\u2019re going to say they feel good. They\u2019re going to say they feel like they can carry everything they did in 2016. But if you look at the enormous enthusiasm that we\u2019ve seen in the early vote, these record-setting early vote numbers, people are going to vote.\u201d Dunn also took objection to Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller\u2019s refusal to address the US president\u2019s unfounded assertion that doctors are inflating Covid-19 deaths for money. \u201cI actually just have to say I\u2019m astonished that Jason Miller spent as much time as he did without ever saying that the doctors who are on frontlines in this coronavirus crisis that this country faces, that without ever defending them and without ever basically saying, no, they\u2019re not in it for money,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cThese people have been risking their lives since the beginning of this crisis. Frontline workers and doctors, nurses, the people who work in these hospitals, have been risking their lives. They didn\u2019t have adequate protective gear at the beginning. No one really knew how it spread. They have been out there every day many of them working double shifts.\u201d She added: We saw for the first time over 100,000 new cases in one day this week. A thousand people a day dying on average now. Jason Miller and the Trump campaign may feel that that\u2019s virtually no one but there are a thousand families in this country who lost someone yesterday. There are a thousand more that will lose someone today. And those are not virtually nobodies.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s campaign rallies may have led to 30,000 additional confirmed cases of Covid-19, and likely resulted in more than 700 deaths overall, according to a Stanford University paper posted online this weekend. The new research analyzed data following 18 Trump rallies held between 20 June and 22 September, three of which were indoors. Dr Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said the Stanford paper was \u201csuggestive\u201d of spread from the events, but not definitive because it was not based on an investigation of actual cases. That would help confirm whether participants were exposed to the virus at the event, rather than other places where transmission is rampant. Minnesota public health officials have attributed four Covid-19 outbreaks and more than 25 cases to Trump rallies held in the state in September and October. An additional 11 state health departments contacted by Reuters said they had not been able to trace infections to the rallies, although some, including Michigan and Wisconsin, have determined that individual people who later tested positive for Covid-19 were present at Trump campaign events. Pollsters from either side of the political spectrum gave their takes on Tuesday\u2019s election during a panel discussion on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt said \u201cit\u2019s going to be very hard\u201d for Donald Trump to overcome Joe Biden\u2019s six-point battleground state lead. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very hard for a couple of reasons,\u201d Horwitt said. \u201cOne, is unlike 2016, this is really a referendum on Donald Trump. We\u2019ve had four years of the Trump presidency. We know what it is like, we\u2019ve seen it, we\u2019ve lived through it. And for the first three years, we wondered what an unconventional president, how he would address a crisis not of his own making. And in his fourth year of his presidency, we know, and the verdict is not, not good when we have 40%, who can approve of the job he\u2019s doing in handling Covid-19. \u201cAnd then, you know, the other thing is that the numbers really have been stable in terms of the trial lead at 10 points now. It was 11 and 14 in debates. There\u2019s been no movement to really suggest that Donald Trump is making, making ground. And the last point is Joe Biden. Joe Biden is net positive, his personal ratings have improved over time, which was not the case in 2016, while Donald Trump remains net negative.\u201d Republican pollster Bill McInturff said the outcome will come down to states with \u201chuge numbers of white, non-college who\u2019ve not yet voted\u201d. \u201cLook, they\u2019re a volatile group, but I think the other thing to look at is who has not voted,\u201d McInturff said. \u201cAmong the roughly three out of 10 people who say they have not voted yet, they\u2019re voting for Donald Trump by almost 30 points. And the states to look at \u2013 and you focused on the right thing, which is white, non-college \u2013 look at the states with huge numbers of white, non-college who\u2019ve not yet voted: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. And this election is going to come down to those states again. \u201cAnd just like we\u2019ve seen historic early vote, I think we\u2019re going to see a historic vote. I think another thing to remember is like \u201904, like 2012, those are two incumbent races, Bush and Obama, where you give smart people a lot of time, a lot of money to change the composition of the electorate. The Republican Party\u2019s done a good job of registering new people in these states and they have devoted a year to try to increase turnout in rural and with white, non-college in these states, and I think these states are going to get very, very close.\u201d A CBS News/YouGov poll finds Joe Biden is entering Tuesday\u2019s election as the clear favorite of voters who have already cast their ballots early, while Donald Trump is leading among those who plan to vote on the day. Some other key findings from CBS News: \u2022 So we took our baseline state model estimates from our initial polling, which sums to Biden holding an Electoral College lead heading into Election Day, and also estimated what it would take for each candidate to ultimately win. \u2022 We estimate from our polling that Mr. Trump is doing, on average, over 30 percentage points better among likely Election-Day voters than early voters. We know the approximate size of the early vote so far, and we vary the potential size of the Election-Day vote to explore two scenarios. \u2022 In our Republican-surge scenario, the size of the Election-Day vote is relatively large, so given that these voters break for Mr. Trump, it mitigates Biden\u2019s early-vote edge, and Mr. Trump inches out close wins in enough states to go over 270. (We increased the size of the Election-Day vote by an average of seven points in this scenario, while keeping vote preference among early voters and Election-Day voters fixed.) \u2022 But it doesn\u2019t take much for this to break big the other way. If some of the people planning to vote on Tuesday decide not to show up, and the size of the Election-Day vote decreases by an average of three points from our initial estimates, the net result is pretty dramatic. Given Biden\u2019s overall preference leads, nearly all the competitive states either flip to Biden or stay in his column, giving him a comfortable win. \u2022 In our baseline scenario, Biden has a narrow Electoral College edge with many states toss ups. In an appearance on ABC\u2019s This Week with George Stephanopoulos, Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller refuses to be pinned down when asked to answer for the US president\u2019s assertion that doctors are inflating Covid-19 deaths for personal enrichment. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into the \u2013 the billing aspects, of which there have been many reports on. There have been all sorts of independent things pointing to that,\u201d Miller said. \u201cBut the fact of the matter is people want to get their life back to normal. They\u2019re tired of the lockdowns. You look at these Democrat-run states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin. We\u2019re seeing this on the campaign trail with the rallies. People are tired of these lockdowns. They want to safely re-open.\u201d When asked about the campaign\u2019s clearest path to 270 electoral votes, Miller points back to the so-called Democratic blue wall in the Rust Belt that Trump crumbled four years ago. \u201cWell, we feel very good,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe think that President Trump is going to hold all of the Sun Belt states that he won previously. And as you look to the upper Midwest, Joe Biden has to stop President Trump in four out of four states; Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota. If President Trump wins just won of those in three of the four that he won last time, he will be a re-elected president.\u201d Donald Trump is plotting a second-term purge of his cabinet if he prevails in Tuesday\u2019s election, according to a very normal story on Politico this morning. Administration officials are already vetting names of health care experts for the top jobs at the Centers for Disease Control, Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services and National Institutes of Health, according to two Republicans close to the White House. Major overhauls are also expected in intelligence and national security posts at the FBI, CIA and Pentagon. More from Politico: The shift would amount to a purge of any Cabinet member who has crossed the president, refused to mount investigations he has demanded, or urged him to take a different, more strict tack on the coronavirus response. The evictions could run the gamut from senior health officials to much of the national security leadership. Already, the White House and administration officials have started to vet names of health care experts who could take over the agencies running many elements of the government\u2019s pandemic response and overseeing the country\u2019s health insurance system, according to two Republicans close to the White House. And the president is eying a remake of leadership at the FBI, CIA and Pentagon, exasperated with what he perceives as unwillingness to investigate his preferred subjects or take on the government\u2019s \u201cdeep state.\u201d This personnel overhaul of the Trump Cabinet at the start of a second term would mirror the turnover his administration has already experienced during his first four years. Of the 23 Cabinet-level posts in the Trump White House, only seven officials lasted all four years. Many, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, had public and contentious departures. And it would represent a fully unencumbered Trump, no longer constrained by political considerations or pushback from Congress. \u201cI can only imagine the score-settling Trump would undertake if he won,\u201d said one Republican close to the White House about the potential Cabinet shakeup. And that\u2019s it from me in London. I will leave you with this clip of Barack Obama\u2019s basketball skills, and hand you over to Bryan Armen Graham in the US\u2026 North Carolina police pepper sprayed and arrested attendees at a get-out-the vote rally because participants blocked the roadway without authorization, authorities said on Saturday. The \u201cI Am Change\u201d march to the polls was organized by the Reverend Greg Drumwright and began as a march from a local church to the courthouse. Drumwright said the group was permitted to stand in the square outside the Alamance county courthouse and was escorted through the streets by the police. He also said that the group had \u201cno intention\u201d of having the rally in the street. \u201cWe are fed up with this kind of treatment in Alamance county and in Graham city,\u201d Drumwright said in a Facebook live video following the altercation. \u201cBoth of those law entities \u2026 colluded to suppress peaceful organizers, who were here not only to vote today, but to call an end to system oppression and racial disparages.\u201d Lindsay Ayling, a graduate student and anti-racism activist who participated in the rally, said police used teargas indiscriminately and without reason on the crowd, including on children. \u201cThe police were looking for excuses to use pepper spray and arrest members of the crowd,\u201c she said.

It is an online event that starts at 2pm if you are in New York, or 7pm if like me you are in London. Guardian journalists Jonathan Freedland, Kenya Evelyn, David Smith and Sarah Churchwell will be discissing the results \u2013 or possibly the lack of them. You can find out more about the event and book tickets here. Jim VandeHei brings us his zen-like plans for having a calm and relaxing election night on Axios. His key points include: Vote and then chill, it\u2019s going to be ages until you get the result. Brace for the possibility of the \u201cRed Mirage\u201d \u2013 Tom McCarthy wrote about this for us yesterday. Don\u2019t share social-media posts that aren\u2019t from a source you trust and know well. It isn\u2019t clear if this recommendation is also directed towards at least one of the candidates. Expect that President Trump may refuse to accept results. Don\u2019t hyperventilate about court cases \u2013 wait until there are verdicts and appeals to appraise their significance. Brace yourself for 78 days of drama and turmoil from 4 November through the inauguration. Hmmmm, I had been hoping for some time off after the election\u2026 Read more here: Axios \u2013 A safe, sane way to navigate election night \u2014 and beyond One notable feature of the campaign has been several publications breaking with tradition to either back a Democratic nominee when you usually expect them to lean to the Republican ticket \u2013 or to indeed make presidential endorsements when they usually don\u2019t. But the Trump campaign are making a lot of noise this morning about the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette opting for a Republican for the first time since 1972. It is not always the most flattering of endorsements, it must be said: We share the embarrassment of millions of Americans who are disturbed by the president\u2019s unpresidential manners and character \u2014 his rudeness and put-downs and bragging and bending of the truth. None of this can be justified. The president\u2019s behavior often has diminished his presidency, and the presidency. Most Americans want a president who makes them proud. However they are bullish about his economic and trade record, and extremely scathing of his opponent. The Biden-Harris ticket offers us higher taxes and a nanny state that will bow to the bullies and the woke who would tear down history rather than learning from history and building up the country. It offers an end to fracking and other Cuckoo California dreams that will cost the economy and the people who most need work right now. \u201cGood-paying green jobs\u201d are probably not jobs for Pittsburgh, or Cleveland, or Toledo, or Youngstown. It offers softness on China, which Mr. Trump understands is our enemy. Mr. Biden is too old for the job, and fragile. There is a very real chance he will not make it through the term. Read it here: Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \u2013 The man and the record Nina Lakhani has been in Allentown, Pennsylvania for us. Biden campaigns in the state today and Monday, and Trump drops by Scranton tomorrow as part of his last day of campaigning too. She\u2019s been finding that the levels of hunger in the state have hit thier highest level since the pandemic\u2019s start: Charles Bennicoff hasn\u2019t worked since last winter. He\u2019s an experienced landscape gardener but the mom-and-pop business he worked for in Allentown, Pennsylvania, cut its staff after losing most of their contracts during the pandemic. Bennicoff, 50, now relies on a food pantry for a few bags of groceries every couple of weeks to supplement the food stamps and social security his mentally ill wife receives. He still picks up the occasional odd job but doesn\u2019t qualify for unemployment benefits because the landscaping job was cash in hand. It\u2019s the first time the couple have needed food aid since recovering from drug addiction and homelessness about 20 years ago, and Bennicoff is struggling to stay positive. \u201cCovid has taken a toll, emotionally and financially. There\u2019s a thousand people dying every day because of the president\u2019s lies, and I can\u2019t just shrug that off. I have tears in my eyes every night,\u201d said Bennicoff. Hunger is rising in Pennsylvania, with the demand for food aid at its highest level since the start of the pandemic, according to new figures obtained by the Guardian. Read more here: \u2018The numbers floored me\u2019: hunger in Pennsylvania hits highest level since pandemic\u2019s start With two days to go, Joe Biden holds a commanding national lead over Donald Trump in the polls. But it isn\u2019t national poll leads that decide who ends up in the White House - it is the electoral college votes of swing states. Chris Kahn and John Whitesides note for Reuters that Biden\u2019s national lead over the Republican president has stayed relatively steady in recent months as the public health crisis has persisted. He is ahead 51% to 43% in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll taken 27-29 October. And in a new national poll from NBC News today while Biden\u2019s lead has narrowed slightly by their reckoning \u2013 down from 11 points to 10 points since two weeks ago. But Trump is still close to Biden in enough state battlegrounds to win the grand prize. \u201cThis is the most competitive election I could imagine if you\u2019re down 10 points nationally,\u201d Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies told NBC News. In polls, Biden repeatedly earns higher marks than Trump on his ability to handle the coronavirus pandemic, and about 30% of Americans say their vote this year is primarily driven by their perception of who would be better at handling the crisis. But will that be enough to hand in the electoral college votes? Today\u2019s NYT/Siena College numbers have Biden leading by 11 points in Wisconsin, six in Arizona and Pennsylvania, and by three points in Florida. Three points is well within a polling margin of error, moving Florida into toss-up territory. A separate ABC/Washington Post poll out today gives Biden a similar seven point lead in Pennsylvania, a state where he will be campaigning today and tomorrow. They give Trump a slight edge in Florida, 50-48. Not looking so good for Biden is Iowa, where any hopes the Democratic nominee had that he could make that race competitive look to have faded. The Des Moines Register report that: Trump has taken over the lead in Iowa as Biden has faded. The president now leads by 7 percentage points over Biden, 48% to 41%. In September\u2019s Iowa Poll, the candidates were tied at 47% to 47%. Turn-out is looking extremely high \u2013 although whether that\u2019s a blue wave building to sweep Trump out of office and the Democrats into power across all branches of government, or it\u2019s a silent endorsement of Trump that the polls haven\u2019t measured is anybody\u2019s guess. You can keep your eagle-eye on the latest numbers in eight crucial swing states with our US elections poll tracker. Donald Trump has made the claim that former James Bond actor Sean Connery assisted him in getting planning applications passed in Scotland. It was announced yesterday that Connery had died, aged 90. In a series of tweets, two days prior to the US election, Trump paid tribute to the much-loved actor, saying that he was \u201chighly regarded and respected in Scotland and beyond\u201d. However, it is the eye-opening claim that Connery stepped in and shouted \u201cLet him build the damn thing\u201d about a big development that is likely to raise eyebrows in Connery\u2019s homeland. The president claims that \u201ceverything went swimmingly\u201d with his development plans after initially \u201chaving a very hard time getting approvals\u201d. The pair did know each other. Connery and Trump were photographed together at several events in New York, including the Johnnie Walker Dressed to Kilt fashion show in the early 2000s. The founding editor of Jacobin magazine and Guardian US columnist Bhaskar Sunkara writes for us this morning, saying that America is a failing state and establishment politics can\u2019t solve the crisis. In 2020, America has shown itself to be exceptional in the worst possible ways. No other rich country has such a poor public health infrastructure or such a tattered social safety net. America\u2019s levels of both police violence and violent crime find their closest peers in countries like Venezuela and South Africa, not Canada and Germany. And even Cuba and Bosnia and Herzegovina beat the world\u2019s only superpower in infant mortality and other key social indicators. In the most powerful country on Earth, 29.3 million people say that they \u201csometimes\u201d or \u201coften\u201d do not have enough to eat. Forty million Americans are impoverished, according to the UN. Half a million are homeless. And all this was true before the full brunt of the pandemic\u2019s economic recession hit. Given these stark figures, the relative stability of the United States is a wonder. The country has maintained popular suffrage and democratic institutions (for white males, at least) for two centuries and married that form of government with a dynamic capitalist economy capable of creating vast wealth. In fact, American business owners have managed to avoid even the rise of a major social-democratic or labor party; in the US, demands for economic justice are filtered through \u2013 and watered down by \u2013 a centrist Democratic party and a byzantine system of government deliberately designed to limit popular passions. But perhaps that muzzling is reaching its limit. Read more here: Bhaskar Sunkara \u2013 America is a failing state. And establishment politics can\u2019t solve the crisis Secretary of state Mike Pompeo has tweeted out this morning in defence of journalists, saying \u201cthey often face threats, attacks, or murders that often go unpunished\u201d. He goes on to \u201ccall on all governments to investigate and redress these crimes.\u201d There might be more than a few journalists with questions for him about the behaviour of the president of the US in this regard. A report earlier this year found that Donald Trump and his administration\u2019s attack on the press \u201cdangerously undermined truth and consensus in a deeply divided country.\u201d The report is based on interviews with nearly 40 journalists, academics, media lawyers, and press freedom advocates. [It] cited a long list of examples of Trump demeaning the press. These include Trump belittling reporter\u2019s questions on the Justice Department investigating journalists\u2019 sources, calls for changes in libel laws to punish reporting he dislikes, and ending the White House daily press briefings for more than a year. \u201cTrump devoted increasing amounts of time to angrily denouncing the press at his large rallies of ardent supporters around the country, encouraging the boisterous crowds to react. He regularly pointed to the mass of reporters, photographers, and videographers penned up in the raised press section behind the crowd, prompting people to turn around, boo, and shout things like, \u2018CNN sucks,\u2019\u201d the report reads. It additionally highlights journalists and news organizations he dislikes receiving threats, like when CNN was sent a package-bomb by a supporter. And of course, Republican congressman Greg Gianforte was fined just $385 and spared jail after pleading guilty to assaulting the then-Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs in 2017. It looks like Scott Atlas took Fauci\u2019s criticism\u2019s of his views on the coronavirus task force really well overnight. Speaking of the Trump administration response to coronavirus, the president has just baselessly tweeted that Joe Biden wants to lockdown the country for years. It has not gone without notice that while there has been good progress on some vaccines, the administration has not hit its promise of having 100 million doses of Coronavirus vaccine ready to go by the end of October. \u201cWe\u2019re in for a whole lot of hurt,\u201d Dr Anthony Fauci told the Washington Post in a hard-hitting interview published on Saturday night, three days out from election day, immediately angering the Trump White House. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good situation. All the stars are aligned in the wrong place as you go into the fall and winter season, with people congregating at home indoors. You could not possibly be positioned more poorly.\u201d More than 9.1m cases of Covid-19 have been recorded in the US and more than 230,000 people have died. Daily case counts vary but agree that on Friday the US set a world record for cases in a single day, at between 99,000 and 100,000. Donald Trump has been regularly claiming the US is \u201crounding the corner\u201d. On Friday he made the baseless claim that doctors were rewarded financially if people died of Covid. His challenger, Joe Biden, who leads most national and battleground state polls, is staging fewer events and, unlike Trump, observing Covid protocols. Fauci told the Post Biden was \u201ctaking it seriously from a public health perspective\u201d. Trump, he said, was \u201clooking at it from a different perspective \u2026 the economy and reopening the country.\u201d Fauci, 79 and the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, serving six presidents, is immensely popular with the public and largely seen as safe from being fired. But the Post also reported that \u201cat one point during the interview, Fauci said he needed to be careful with his words because he would be blocked from doing appearances in the future\u201d. Fauci was critical of a controversial outsider brought into the coronavirus taskforce by Trump. Scott Atlas, a Stanford neuroradiologist and Fox News contributor, favours ending public health restrictions and pursuing \u201cherd immunity\u201d. \u201cI have real problems with that guy,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cHe\u2019s a smart guy who\u2019s talking about things that I believe he doesn\u2019t have any real insight or knowledge or experience in. He keeps talking about things that when you dissect it out and parse it out, it doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d Back to the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said at the weekend that the spread of coronavirus is out of control in New Mexico, as she urged residents to stay home and avoid gathering with others. \u201cPlease do your part to protect yourself and your fellow New Mexicans by celebrating a COVID-SAFE Halloween,\u201d the Democratic governor\u2019s office said in a Facebook post. \u201cStay home. Do not gather with others.\u201d State officials on Saturday reported 592 additional known virus cases and 11 additional deaths but said the case data for the day was incomplete due to a technical problem. \u201cDue to a technical disruption of the electronic laboratory reporting system, the following data reflects only a partial total for today\u2019s case update,\u201d state officials said in a statement. \u201cThe delayed results will be included in the state\u2019s reporting as soon as they are received and confirmed.\u201d The additional cases and deaths reported Saturday increased the state\u2019s totals to 46,490 cases and 1,018 deaths. Here\u2019s the latest nationwide figures according to the Johns Hopkins University, as of this morning. Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota and Alaska continue to be the states showing the most alarming rises in cases. Rachel Bitecofer, one of Project Lincoln\u2019s senior advisers and a sometime contributor to this website, is letting her election nerves show. Donald Trump has often referenced his \u2018beautiful\u2019 wall on the US-Mexico border, but I don\u2019t imagine he was thinking of it being decorated like this when he said it. Reuters report that protesters in Mexico burned effigies of Donald Trump and a border patrol agent yesterday while condemning the administration\u2019s immigration policies and urging Americans to reject Trump at the ballot box on Tuesday. A few dozen migrant activists marched to the beach fence separating Mexico from the United States at the border city of Tijuana chanting, \u201cTrump, we won\u2019t pay for your wall,\u201d then set fire to a crude, besuited effigy of the president on a stick. \u201cWe\u2019re calling on people to vote against Trump and in favor of hope. Biden has promised us a humanitarian migration reform, we\u2019ll be watching to ensure the promises are kept this time,\u201d said Hugo Castro, a Mexican-American migrant activist. Lauren Boebert, who has generated plenty of column inches as she runs for Congress, has been having a slow motion spat on Twitter with her Democratic opponent for Colorado\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, Diane Mitsch Bush. Boebert yesterday boasted that she had been endorsed by South Dakota\u2019s Gov. Kristi Noem. Bush made a joke in a familiar online meme-format, suggesting that perhaps Boebert was confused about the geography of where she was standing for election. Boebert has made it clear this morning that she didn\u2019t find it particularly funny. Which is slightly surprising, as given that Boebert is one of the Congressional candidates who have given some credence to the QAnon conspiracy theory, you\u2019d think she\u2019d be more in favor of internet memeology. The Trump team has ten rallies planned in the next 48 hours. Facing what appears to be a narrow path to re-election, the president is to make stops in seven states likely to prove pivotal in deciding if he will remain in the White House for four more years, or whether he will become the first president since the senior George Bush failed in a bid for a second term in 1992. It is his campaign\u2019s busiest stretch, reports Steve Holland for Reuters. The Republican incumbent aims to generate enough momentum to drive an overwhelming turnout by his supporters. He will finish the two-day blitz with a late-night rally on Monday in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the same location where he finished his campaign in 2016. Weighing down Trump is a rising number of coronavirus infections. Trump has continually played down the virus and says his opponents are using it against him. He\u2019s even gone on the attack against the very doctors who have been trying to save the lives of the Americans who have been hospitalised with Covid. At a rally on Saturday in Newtown, Pennsylvania, Trump seemed to lament his close race with Biden, who he considers a weak opponent. \u201cThis could only happen to me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHow could we be tied?\u201d Some Republicans are pessimistic about Trump\u2019s chances, believing he has too many states where his back is up against the wall, fearing the 90 million who have cast ballots early suggest a wave building against the president. But Trump and his team believe polls undersell the Republican\u2019s level of support, arguing many of his backers do not want to admit as much to pollsters and that, thanks to a strong Republican get-out-the-vote effort, the incumbent will win. Gary Langer at ABC News brings us more on the final few polls of election season. He says there\u2019s been little change from September in the two critical swing states of Florida and Pennsylvania. The pandemic versus the economy defines the presidential contest in two key battlegrounds, with Florida holding firm to its toss-up status while Joe Biden leads slightly in Pennsylvania in the season\u2019s final ABC News/Washington Post polls. There\u2019s little change in either state. In Florida, Donald Trump has 50% support among likely voters to Biden\u2019s 48%; it was 51%-47% in an ABC/Post poll Sept. 20. Trump won the state by 112,911 votes out of more than 9.4 million cast in 2016. In Pennsylvania, the race stands at 51%-44%, Biden-Trump, a 7-point advantage for the Democrat; that compares with a 9-point margin late last month. Here, Trump\u2019s 2016 win was even narrower: 44,292 votes out of nearly 6.2 million cast. The president finishes his busy day with an 11pm rally in Florida today. Biden is on the campaign trail in Pennsylvania both Sunday and Monday. Read more here: ABC News \u2013 Florida maintains toss-up status while Biden leads slightly in Pennsylvania A slightly left field pitch for the presidency from the Joe Biden team here\u2026 Newsweek bring us a report on events outside Attorney General William Barr\u2019s house last night, where it seems that pro-Trump demonstrators rocked up to protest that Barr hasn\u2019t done enough to lock up Joe Biden in the run-up to the election. Protesters carrying Trump flags picketed Attorney General William Barr\u2019s home on Saturday because they believe he isn\u2019t doing enough to bring former Vice President Joe Biden to justice. President Donald Trump has referred to Biden as a criminal and said he and his son, Hunter Biden, are part of an \u201corganized crime family.\u201d This is due in part to unsubstantiated allegations about the Bidens\u2019 business dealings with foreign countries. Social media users also shared photos of the scene, with one picture featuring a white horse. AP journalist Mike Balsamo reported that the Department of Justice had said Barr went out to speak to the picketers. \u201cLet me tell you something, Joe Biden is a criminal and he\u2019s been a criminal for a long time, and you\u2019re a criminal and the media for not reporting it,\u201d Trump told reporters on 20 October. Read more here: Newsweek \u2013 Protesters with Trump flags swarm William Barr\u2019s home demanding he \u2018lock up Joe Biden\u2019 It was a grey autumn Saturday earlier this month at a Republican rally just outside Youngstown, Ohio \u2013 a once prosperous city in the heart of America\u2019s rustbelt, embedded in a region that flipped to Donald Trump in 2016. What started as a casual political gathering, however, descended into a full-throated confrontation that encapsulated the stark divisions that underscore this seminal election, and perhaps the state of the country as a whole. A bashed up red Chevy pickup daubed in handmade \u201cDump Trump\u201d signs pulled up slowly. And a lone protester, Chuckie Denison, a former factory worker at a local General Motors plant that closed last year, jumped out to berate the assembled crowd. \u201cTwo-hundred-and-twenty-thousand Americans have died under Trump. And our jobs have gone.\u201d he shouted. \u201cAnd all we ask is for somebody to represent all of us.\u201d I\u2019d come to Youngstown because Donald Trump had made direct promises to the people living here; to restore a failing economy and bring back manufacturing jobs after years of decay. But poverty and jobless rates continue to soar here. In that crowd of Trump supporters were people who had worked at the same plant as Denison, and others who had lost their jobs during the pandemic. And yet they still believed Trump would bring stability to their lives. \u201cHe\u2019s probably paid,\u201d said one Trump supporter \u2013 dismissing Denison, who had been accosted by a number of the flag wavers. Within minutes, Denison\u2019s signs were ripped from his truck and he was sent away in a whirlwind of abusive language. You can read more of Oliver Laughland\u2019s Anywhere But Washington conclusions here: On my travels, I saw a vision of two Americas \u2013 but which one will triumph? Ever since the 15th amendment granted Black men the right to vote, southern states have found myriad ways to walk back this basic tenet of democracy. From white primaries to poll taxes, to literacy tests and recent voter roll purges, voter suppression has always been a defining characteristic of American elections. Roopa Gogineni brings us today this incredible gallery of photography documenting voter suppression in Georgia. Very different tenors in the opening social media salvos from each campaign this morning\u2026 Here\u2019s a reminder that the election system in the US is incredibly decentralised, and there\u2019s a huge state-by-state variation in whether mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day are counted if they are postmarked that they were sent on 3 November or before. In some cases, a long deadline for them to arrive, like until 20 November in California or 23 November in Washington, is not that important. It\u2019s unlikely that a late flurry of mail-in ballots is going to tip the result in those solidly Democratic states. However, this year Iowa, North Carolina and Ohio could be interesting, as the election may be very tight there. And there\u2019s going to be a legal question mark hanging over the count in Pennsylvania and Minnesota, where as mentioned earlier, legal action could yet disqualify mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day. Here\u2019s a quick run-down of the deadlines for each state that does allow ballots to arrive after 3 November. Texas (4 November) Virginia (Noon on 6 November) Kansas (6 November) Kentucky (6 November) Massachusetts (6 November) Pennsylvania (6 November - subject to legal challenge) Iowa (9 November) North Dakota (9 November) West Virginia (9 November) Minnesota (10 November - subject to legal challenge) Mississippi (10 November) Nevada (10 November) New Jersey (10 November) New York (10 November) North Carolina (12 November) Alaska (by 13 November) District of Columbia (13 November) Maryland (13 November) Ohio (13 November, result not announced til 28 November) Illinois (17 November) Utah (17 November) California (20 November) Washington (23 November) As a journalist you always love it when someone gives you a cracking quote, and Amie Parnes must have been thrilled when a Democratic strategist told her that \u201cWe\u2019re all fucking nervous as shit\u201d about the election. But columnist Bill Nemitz writes for the Portland Press Herald this morning that he feels strangely less anxious the closer the election approaches \u2013 thanks to \u201cthe pendulum effect\u201d. As surely as the pendulum had swung toward what was once unthinkable \u2013 a Black family occupying the White House \u2013 it swung back. The racism that still festers across this land, coupled with the anger across blue-collar America that it had been taken for granted and left behind long enough, gave us first the tea party and then, alas, Donald Trump. These are perilous times. We\u2019ve had violence in the streets. We\u2019ve had political paralysis. We have a president whose utterances grow more bizarre, more detached from reality, by the day. And yes, we have a resurgent pandemic. Yet, as we hurtle toward this climactic moment, I\u2019m more excited than exhausted. I believe in my gut that the pendulum is moving once again, away from the hate and animosity that have defined the past four years and toward an essential goodness that has always guided this country in theory if not always in practice. Read it here: Portland Press Herald \u2013 Bill Nemitz: It\u2019s almost here \u2013 a banner day for the USA Jan Wolfe and Makini Brice at Reuters bring us this quick run-through of some of the key lawsuits fought over how to run Tuesday\u2019s election. They highlight \u2013 some of which remain to be resolved with two days to go: Texas drive-through voting: US District Judge Andrew Hanen in Houston on Monday will consider whether votes already cast at 10 drive-through voting sites in the Houston area should be rejected. The lawsuit was brought by conservative Steve Hotze and state Representative Steve Toth. They accused the county clerk of exceeding his constitutional authority by allowing drive-through voting as an alternative to walk-in voting during the coronavirus pandemic. Texas ballot drop-off sites: Republican officials and Trump\u2019s campaign have argued, without evidence, that the boxes could enable voting fraud. The state\u2019s highest court ruled that Governor Greg Abbott could limit drop-off sites for ballots. \u201cThe plaintiffs complain that limiting early hand-deliveries of mail-in ballots to one office per county requires more travel time for some voters. But this ignores the other options for casting their ballots that these voters have,\u201d the court wrote. The three justices who issued the decision are Republicans. Minnesota ballot deadline extension: A federal appeals court said Minnesota\u2019s plan to count absentee ballots received after Election Day was illegal, siding with Republicans. \u201cHowever well-intentioned and appropriate from a policy perspective in the context of a pandemic during a presidential election, it is not the province of a state executive official to re-write the state\u2019s election code,\u201d the majority wrote. The court instructed Minnesota election officials to identify and \u201csegregate\u201d absentee ballots received after 3 November. Those ballots would not be counted if a final judgment is entered in the Republicans\u2019 favor. Wisconsin mail-in ballot count: Wisconsin election officials cannot count mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day, a conservative majority of the supreme court ruled on 26 October. Liberal Justice Elena Kagan dissented, saying the majority\u2019s decision would \u201cdisenfranchise large numbers of responsible voters in the midst of hazardous pandemic conditions.\u201d Florida restrictions on ex-felons: A court ruled in September that Florida could require felons to pay fines, restitution and legal fees they owe before they regain their right to vote. By a 6-4 vote, it reversed a lower court ruling that the measure amounted to an unconstitutional poll tax. Five of the six judges in the majority were appointed by Trump. Nearly 900,000 Floridians with felony convictions will be unable to vote in the election because of the decision North Carolina ballot extension: The supreme court on Thursday left in place North Carolina\u2019s extension of the deadline to receive mail-in ballots. The state election board opted to allow absentee ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted if they arrived up to nine days later. The justices denied a request from Republican state lawmakers to put on hold the agreement. Pennsylvania mail-in ballot extension: The Pennsylvania supreme court ruled in September that officials could accept mail-in ballots three days after the election, as long as they were postmarked by Election Day. The supreme court denied a request from Pennsylvania Republicans to review the decision on an expedited basis \u2013 but could still revisit the dispute and rule on it after the election. Pennsylvania \u201cnaked ballots\u201d: Republicans prevailed on one issue at Pennsylvania\u2019s high court. Interpreting a state law, the court said officials must throw out \u201cnaked ballots\u201d that arrive without inner \u201csecrecy envelopes.\u201d Democrats have warned the ruling could lead to more than 100,000 votes being thrown out. There\u2019s an argument that the climate crisis has not been high enough up the agenda during the US election, with the extreme weather that the country has already suffered this year. And when it does get mentioned, it is often in terms of a negative economic impact on jobs, rather than as a positive to avoid disasters. While it isn\u2019t heading for the US, tropical storm Eta formed in the Caribbean on Saturday evening, headed toward the coast of Nicaragua and Honduras, which it is expected to lash with heavy rain and hurricane-strength winds in the coming days. It is expected to gather to hurricane strength on Monday. Eta is the 28th named Atlantic storm this season, tying the 2005 record for named storms \u2013 and hurricane season still has a month to go. Authorities in Louisiana are still in the process of clearing up after hurricane Zeta, which hit this week, causing what Gov. John Bel Edwards says was \u201ccatastrophic\u201d damage. Some background on that Trump tweet I mentioned earlier, where he had called for Facebook to reinstate a group which had 23,000 members called \u2018N.J. Women for Trump\u2019. NJ.com reported about it yesterday: Priscilla Confrey, co-director of New Jersey Women For Trump, says Facebook did not send her any notifications about the removal or explain why the group was removed [on Saturday morning]. Facebook does affix warning labels on posts they deem problematic, and Confrey says in the last two weeks Facebook had flagged certain posts, including those related to Covid-19. When that happens, Confrey said she simply deletes those post rather than have them appear. \u201cPeople are really, really mad,\u201d Confrey says. \u201cWhen you have that many people and they\u2019re shut down, they feel silenced.\u201d \u201cIt was a lot of work over the past year for a private group to just be shut down without notification,\u201d Confrey says. \u201cThree days before Election Day? That is absolutely appalling. I just think these companies, these social media groups, have too much power. They offer to you to open up a group on their social media platform, and you could have 30,000 members, and they shut it down without telling you anything.\u201d Trump tweeted out the NJ.com story overnight, demanding that Facebook restore the group. Our Guardian America editor John Mullholland writes for us this morning, saying that as welcome as it might be in some quarters, a win for Joe Biden would only scratch the surface of America\u2019s afflictions Getting rid of Trump might be one thing, fixing America is another. If the president loses, there will be much talk of a new normality and the need for a democratic reset. Hopes will be voiced for a return to constitutional norms. There will be calls for a return of civility in public discourse and a healing of the partisan divide that scars America. All of that is as it should be. But it ought to come with a recognition that America was broken long before it elected Trump and his departure would be no guarantee that the country will be mended. Many of the systemic issues that afflict the US predate Trump. His ugly and dysfunctional presidency has distracted from many of the fundamentals that have beset America for decades, even centuries. But they remain stubbornly in place. If he does lose, America will no longer have Trump to blame. Two two-term Democratic presidents over the past 30 years have not significantly affected the structural issues that corrode US democracy and society, and race is always at their heart. The past few months have drawn further attention to the systemic racism and brutality that characterise much policing. But racism in the States is not confined to the police. In fact, it is not confined at all. Read more here: John Mulholland \u2013 A win for Joe Biden would only scratch the surface of America\u2019s afflictions New polling numbers out today, and it is mostly a good outlook for the Biden campaign \u2013 to the extent that we are going to believe the polls, anyway. Wisconsin appears out of reach for Trump and likely to return to the Democratic side of the ledger. Arizona and Pennsylvania each give Biden a solid but not solidified six-point lead. And Florida is, well, Florida. Leaning to Biden by three points, the Sunshine state is once again headed to a photo finish That\u2019s Don Levy, Director of the Siena College Research Institute, who have published the numbers in conjunction with the New York Times this morning. Biden leads by 11 points in Wisconsin, six in Arizona and Pennsylvania, and by three points in Florida. Those were all Trump victories in 2016. The NYT/Siena College poll makes it as: Arizona: Biden 49% \u2013 Trump 43% Florida: Biden 47% \u2013 Trump 44% Pennsylvania: Biden 49% \u2013 Trump 43% Wisconsin: Biden 52% \u2013 Trump 41% Here\u2019s a bit more on that incident with the Democratic party campaign bus incident in Texas. The Washington Post reports: Biden\u2019s campaign said in a statement that cars with Trump signs and flags surrounded its bus on the way from San Antonio to Austin. The bus was on Interstate 35, it said, when cars pulled in front of the bus and slowed, attempting to \u201cstop the bus in the middle of the highway.\u201d Campaign staff called 911, according to the statement, getting help from law enforcement to reach their destination. Video captures a white SUV and a truck colliding behind the Biden bus. Donald Trump then appeared to add encouragement to this behavior. He tweeted a video of flag-bearing cars surrounding a Biden campaign bus on the road, with the message \u201cI LOVE TEXAS!\u201d. Texas should be a resoundingly safe win for the Republicans, although Democrats seem to think that polling shows it may be in play, and Mike Bloomberg has pumped cash into an ad campaign in support of Joe Biden in the state. The number of early voters there has already exceeded 2016\u2019s turn-out. The cancelled event was due to be held in the parking lot of the Texas American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations building. Tariq Thowfeek, the Biden campaign\u2019s comms director in Texas, said: Rather than engage in productive conversation about the drastically different visions that Joe Biden and Donald Trump have for our country, Trump supporters in Texas today instead decided to put our staff, surrogates, supporters, and others in harm\u2019s way. Here\u2019s a bit more on where we can expect to see the candidates out and about on the last couple of days. Today Donald Trump is visiting: Washington, Michigan Dubuque, Iowa Hickory, North Carolina Rome, Georgia Miami, Florida He\u2019s then got a similarly busy schedule for Monday, where the president is planning to swing by: Fayetteville, North Carolina Scranton, Pennsylvania Traverse City, Michigan Kenosha, Wisconsin Grand Rapids, Michigan Mike Pence and Trump family members are also expected to be out and about campaigning in Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, New Hampshire and Ohio, over the next two days. The Joe Biden campaign is at a slightly more staid pace. Today the Democratic nominee is visiting Philadelphia. His campaign have said he is expected to \u201cdiscuss bringing Americans together and to address the crises facing the country\u201d. Parts of Philadelphia were under curfew earlier in the week as the city saw protests over the police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr as he had a mental health crisis. Biden will also campaign in Pennsylvania tomorrow. Hi, and welcome to Sunday\u2019s coverage of the US election \u2013 two days before election day arrives at last. Donald Trump will be in Michigan, Iowa, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida \u2013 his last rally doesn\u2019t start until 11pm. Joe Biden targets one place: Philadelphia in Pennsylvania. Here\u2019s a catch-up on where we are\u2026 Obama lent a hand as Biden and Trump launched their final campaign blitz amid a surging pandemic, record early voting and gnawing uncertainty over when the outcome of the presidential election will be known. The US set a world record for coronavirus cases in 24 hours. The Reuters tally of a daily caseload of 100,233 surpassed a record set in India last month. Dr Anthony Fauci said \u201cWe\u2019re in for a whole lot of hurt. It\u2019s not a good situation\u201d about the pandemic. Early voting has been surging in Texas. In a stunning display of enthusiasm, more than 9.6m Texans have voted ahead of election day. Trump used Twitter to try and order Facebook to restore a \u201cNew Jersey women for Trump\u201d group which the social media company had pulled. Texas Democrats cancelled an event for \u201cpublic safety and security reasons\u201d after their campaign bus was followed by Trump supporters which they claim tried to \u201crun it off the road\u201d. Video shows the bus being surrounded by SUVs on the interstate.
