These, however, aren't the only affinities Cate Le Bon has with Gruff Rhys. Far more persuasively, Le Bon, like Rhys, is someone whose take on songwriting is so sideways, their take so slanted to themselves, it would be completely impossible for anyone else to replicate it. Oddball reminiscences of childhood experience. Reference to dead domestic animals. A deadpan delivery. All of these were a feature of Le Bon's debut LP Me Oh My, released on Rhys's label. Her new album Cryk fills things out with an indie pop-style backing, but although there's a suspicion this is a mistake, Le Bon's originality shines through the superfluous touches.

His early work as one of Atlantan group Boyz N Da Hood was a straightforward exploration of thug life. Since going solo, however, Jeezy (he's 34) has tried something ambitious: attempting to keep up these hardcore \"uncommercial\" pretensions, but not exactly risking obscurity (unless your idea of going incognito is guesting on a Rihanna single). It's an uneasy mixture, but not an entirely unfamiliar one. Romantic subtext. Bad boy lyrics. All round, it's Lovable Rogue 101. ABC, Glasgow, Sat; Manchester Academy, Sun; IndigO2, SE10, Mon; O2 Academy Birmingham, Tue JR Professor Green, On tour Things never quite worked out for Mike Skinner as a businessman. Still, hindsight has shown his signing of Hackney MC Professor Green as an act of considerable wisdom. Certainly, there was then and remains now some common ground between the pair, not least good jokes, a self-deprecating streak, and the presence of deceased fathers as an influence in otherwise more upbeat work. Read All About It, the No 1 single in which Green reflects on his father's suicide is one such example of this, along the way supplying one of those surprisingly lachrymose songs British people feel they can get behind. It's an isolated moment on his latest, At Your Inconvenience, however, an album where some of Green's earlier charm has been replaced with disproportionate self-confidence.

Hawkins embraces a range of music many artists still separately compartmentalise: traditional and contemporary classical music, all kinds of jazz and improv, even a spiky kind of Hammond organ funk. But he doesn't sacrifice the detailed virtues of these idioms to dilettantism, so his ventures manage to be eclectic while retaining precision and strength. With his new album All There Ever Out, Hawkins pays tribute to Thelonious Monk's knotty thematic style, to early jazz-piano genius Art Tatum, and to bebop and free-jazz. He's aided here by an unusual quintet, including reeds-player Shabaka Hutchings and electric guitarist Otto Fischer. Vortex Jazz Club, N16, Sun John Fordham Nancarrow Weekend, London Even within a musical culture defined by its individualists, Conlon Nancarrow was a singular figure. He was always quintessentially an American composer, but after being refused a passport in 1940 because of his communist sympathies, one who chose to live outside the US, in Mexico City, for the rest of his life. There he composed the music on which his reputation and influence is now based. Almost all of it was conceived for the mechanical player-piano, so that Nancarrow could ensure that the intricacies and exuberantly complex polyphony of his works were accurately realised. At the core of of Nancarrow's achievement are his 51 studies for player-piano, and they are also at the heart of the Southbank Centre's weekend devoted to the composer. They will be realised in a series of recitals by player-piano expert Rex Lawson, but there are also concerts by the London Sinfonietta and the Arditti Quartet. Southbank Centre, SE1, Sat &amp; Sun Andrew Clements The Importance Of Being Earnest, London The successful comic operas of the 100 years can easily be counted upon the fingers of one hand. But Gerald Barry's fourth full-length opera might be an addition to that select group. If any composer can turn Wilde's dramatic masterpiece into an opera and make it even funnier, then you'd reckon it has to be Barry. Quirky humour and surreal strangeness have been persistent features of his music for 30 years, and reports of last year's LA premiere suggest that the Earnest score contains plenty more of the same. It arrives in the UK in concert performances from BCMG, conducted by Thomas Ad\u00e8s.
