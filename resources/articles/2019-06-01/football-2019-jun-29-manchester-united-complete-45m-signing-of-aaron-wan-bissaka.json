The England Under-21 international, who made his first-team debut for Palace less than 18 months ago, has signed a five-year contract with United worth \u00a380,000 a week. United have agreed to pay \u00a345m for Wan-Bissaka and another \u00a35m in add-ons, making him the club\u2019s fifth-biggest signing. There is also an option to extend his contract by a further year. \u201cIt\u2019s an unbelievable feeling and an honour to call myself a Manchester United player and something I know that only a small number of players have the privilege to say,\u201d Wan-Bissaka said. \u201cAs a kid, every kid wants to play for a team like this. I\u2019m grateful and it\u2019s an honour to represent this club. I think I will improve every step and learn different things around new teammates. I think Manchester United is a big club, big family, big fanbase and they all stick together. I can see that I have made [my family] proud with this decision and where I\u2019ve come from. I personally think they know what\u2019s right for me.\u201d Wan-Bissaka is United\u2019s second signing of the summer, following the \u00a315m addition of Daniel James from Swansea, and fits the profile of player \u2013 talented, young and hungry \u2013 the club are seeking to attract. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, United\u2019s manager, described the 21-year-old right-back as \u201cone of the best upcoming defenders in the Premier League\u201d and believes he has all the attributes to succeed at Old Trafford. \u201cHe has the right work ethic, talent and mentality to play for Manchester United and he fits exactly the type of player that we are looking to bring into the squad to help us improve and push on further,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cAaron is a young, hungry player and eager to learn and that\u2019s important at his age. I am delighted he has signed with us and we look forward to continuing his tremendous development so far.\u201d Wan-Bissaka\u2019s move to Old Trafford completes a meteoric rise. Last season was his first full campaign at senior level as a professional footballer and he has made only 46 first-team appearances. His performances for Palace soon caught the eye, however, and he finished last season as their player of the year and with some hugely impressive statistics to his name, including making more tackles than any other defender in Europe\u2019s elite leagues. Solskj\u00e6r is targeting further defensive additions, with a central defender seen as a priority. Harry Maguire is at the top of their list \u2013 Manchester City are also competing for the England international \u2013 but any transfer seems a way off because of Leicester\u2019s valuation, which is around \u00a380m and based on the fee that Southampton received for Virgil van Dijk. That sort of asking price is likely to put Maguire out of United\u2019s reach until they generate funds by moving players on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
