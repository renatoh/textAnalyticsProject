Liverpool\u2019s captain must hope Manchester City somehow stumble at home against Brendan Rodgers\u2019 Leicester and allow J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side to regain control of their own destiny before Sunday\u2019s Premier League title race denouement. As the hours ebb away before kick-off Henderson may be tempted to pick up his phone, relocate a once familiar number and press send. Whether he will actually text Rodgers, previously his manager at Anfield, and appeal for assistance remains unclear. \u201cNo I won\u2019t, well maybe I will,\u201d mused the undecided England midfielder. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d Henderson was speaking at the end of a breathlessly exciting Saturday evening concluding with Divock Origi\u2019s late winner consigning an impressive Newcastle to a 3-2 defeat as Liverpool restored a two-point lead over City. The odds are it will be only a temporary advantage but Henderson is not giving up quite yet. \u201cThe lads will watch Monday\u2019s game and, yeah, pray for a miracle,\u201d said a former Sunderland player subject to some spicy songs from the crowd whenever he touched the ball. \u201cCity are a great team but so are we. \u201cWhoever gets the title will deserve it. We couldn\u2019t have done any more. We can\u2019t have any regrets. It\u2019s going to the last game and we need to finish on a high at Anfield \u2013 [against Wolves on Sunday] \u2013 and pray that something, a miracle, can happen.\u201d Considering that City visit Brighton next weekend, Leicester appear to offer the greater hope of thwarting Pep Guardiola\u2019s side but it should not be forgotten that Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s Newcastle very nearly left Klopp\u2019s domestic ambitions holed beneath the waterline. Ben\u00edtez \u2013 like Rodgers another ghost of Anfield past \u2013 revelled in reminding everyone that, while Newcastle\u2019s players may have their limitations, his coaching ability warrants bracketing alongside the very best. Afterwards, in a stadium corridor beneath the main stand, he and Klopp embraced warmly but, as Liverpool head into Tuesday\u2019s Champions League semi-final second leg at home to Barcelona with the Catalans 3-0 up, it is tempting to wonder whether Newcastle\u2019s manager might have done marginally better than the German this season. It is an academic question and such comparisons can be invidious but Ben\u00edtez did win four trophies \u2013 including the 2005 Champions League \u2013 during six years on Merseyside spent operating with a comparatively modest budget. At least Klopp has reminded everyone that, sometimes, the journey really is more exciting, and important, than the destination. In another year his side might have swept up trophies galore but in this season of peak City and vintage Lionel Messi does it really matter if they do not actually end up hoisting silverware? What surely counts is that they are still there, still challenging? \u201cWe cannot do more,\u201d said Klopp, unequivocally. \u201cThe boys have done much more than I thought possible. Let\u2019s try to get to 97 points and then we\u2019re ready for judgment. \u201cWhatever happens, this will be a very, very successful season and I\u2019m pretty sure that all our supporters can see it like this.\u201d For the moment, though, a coach possibly without a concussed Mohamed Salah this week is not contemplating a runner\u2019s-up role. \u201cI don\u2019t think about it for a second,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind we win. I know it might not happen but thinking about a negative scenario is a waste of time. You deal with it when it happens.\u201d The German prefers to live in the present and, at that precise moment, on an unseasonably cold Tyneside night, he was delighted. \u201cIt was a brilliant game from my side against a Newcastle team who are pretty difficult to defend against and make you work hard. I wasn\u2019t sure we could do it but we did. I\u2019m absolutely proud.\u201d At Newcastle Ben\u00edtez has, albeit in a very different context, also learnt about the pleasures of travelling rather than merely arriving. Indeed Newcastle\u2019s manager seems to take a perverse pleasure from facing the Klopps and Guardiolas \u2013 whose side he beat in January \u2013 with one hand in effect tied behind his back. \u201cLiverpool have everything, so to manage them like we did we\u2019re really pleased,\u201d he said at the end of a night on which Christian Atsu and Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n excelled, each registering the equalisers which levelled matters following Virgil van Dijk\u2019s headed opener and Salah\u2019s volleyed second. \u201cWe did quite well but to beat these teams you need to be very good tactically and, even then, you can lose.\u201d Given the circumstances \u2013 namely that Newcastle\u2019s XI cost a fraction of Liverpool\u2019s ensemble \u2013 there has to be a limit as to how much difference a coach, however good, can make. Ben\u00edtez likens the situation to motor-racing in a family saloon or super-mini. \u201cLook at Formula One,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re at bends you can fight but, in a straight line, the fast cars will go past you; you can be the best driver in the world it doesn\u2019t matter \u2026 So you want to drive in Monaco where it\u2019s bendy and you have a chance!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
