The 56-year old entertainer, the daughter of showbusiness legend Judy Garland, is in advanced talks about a fly-on-the-wall documentary series about her life with her new husband, Broadway producer David Gest. Minnelli is in negotiations with music channel VH1 about a reality show following her and Gest's life together. \"They [Minnelli and Gest] are in talks in America about a reality show,\" said a spokeswoman for VH1-UK. \"The project is still in the junior stages and a date has not yet been set.\" The show, which would be similar in style to MTV's surprise smash hit, The Osbournes, would be shown first in the US and then the UK, the spokeswoman said. The American actress has recently embarked on the comeback trail after years of illness and heartache. Minnelli disappeared from the media spotlight for several years after contracting viral encephalitis - a potentially fatal disease that causes swelling of the brain - back and hip surgery, and fighting an addiction to painkillers. Having recovered she married Gest at a star-studded ceremony in New York earlier this year after shedding 70lbs in weight, and launched a European tour with five nights at London's Royal Albert Hall. The huge success of The Osbournes has breathed new life into the career of former Black Sabbath rocker Ozzy and made household names of his wife Sharon and children Jack and Kelly. A similarly well-received hit would be the perfect vehicle for any star wanting to rejuvenate their career. Actress Cybill Shepherd, Kiss frontman Gene Simmons and rapper Sean \"Puffy\" Combs are reported to have expressed an interest in their own shows. But whether Hollywood star Minnelli would have as much kitsch appeal as the riotous, unpredictable and foul-mouthed rock royalty of the Osbourne family remains to be seen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
