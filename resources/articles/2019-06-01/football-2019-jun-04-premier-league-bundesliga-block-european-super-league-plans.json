Speaking as world football\u2019s associations and confederations gathered for Wednesday\u2019s Fifa congress in Paris, Reinhard Rauball, who is also president of Borussia Dortmund and vice-president of the German Football Association, said that the ECA proposals could \u201cdestroy\u201d national leagues. He did acknowledge, however, that some reform may be needed to the Champions League format when the current agreed football calendar concludes in 2024. Within Uefa there is widespread satisfaction with the Champions League\u2019s popularity and commercial success \u2013 the president, Aleksander Ceferin, said there had been 900,000 applications for final tickets \u2013 but widely held concerns at the automatic qualification of four clubs from Europe\u2019s top four leagues, and at the financial dominance of the Premier League. The Premier League and Bundesliga have made public statements opposing the ECA plans, and David Gill, the Football Association\u2019s representative on the Uefa executive committee, is understood to have expressed serious reservations within Uefa. The plans \u2013 principally worked up by the ECA, whose president, the Juventus president Andrea Agnelli, called for an expansion of the Champions League last year \u2013 are for more group stage matches by having four groups of eight clubs, and a system of promotion and relegation with the Europa League which would leave 24 clubs remaining in the Champions League at the end of each season. \u201cI am the president of the German league and president of Borussia Dortmund; our league, the Bundesliga, decided 100% that we don\u2019t go this way with the ECA,\u201d Rauball said. \u201cDavid Gill thinks in the same way, the German and British leagues are opposing it and I don\u2019t think it is possible we will find a solution without Germany and without England.\u201d Rauball said of the ECA proposals, which were presented by Uefa to the European Leagues organisation this month and met outspoken opposition: \u201cThis is a typical American kind of competition, a kind of closed shop. In Europe we have a traditional football pyramid, and in Germany we have the [Bundesliga] league with the highest attendances [in Europe], more than 42,000 average, and that has been developed step by step. So we don\u2019t want to destroy it with one decision. \u201cWe have to make clear that the national league is most important. If you make a pyramid like the ECA, we would destroy all the clubs and that is what is dangerous. We are traditionalists and we want that this is the future of football as well.\u201d The new Champions League proposals were also condemned by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, after a meeting with the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, in advance of the Women\u2019s World Cup which kicks off in France on Friday. The president of the France Football Federation, No\u00ebl Le Gra\u00ebt, has expressed firm opposition. \u201cI fully support president Le Gra\u00ebt to go against the reform that is planned at Uefa,\u201d Macron said. The ECA, having met such widespread opposition to its plans \u2013 which the ECA has not yet publicly confirmed, issuing only a set of \u201cprinciples\u201d \u2013 is holding a special general assembly of member clubs in Malta on Thursday or Friday this week to further discuss them. Rauball said of the current format that he agreed with Edwin van der Sar, the Ajax chief executive, that it is wrong for Ajax, despite their splendid run to the Champions League semi-finals this season, to have to start in the qualifying rounds next season. \u201cPeople are saying: \u2018Let\u2019s take the problem and cool it down,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s first discuss and perhaps we find a [compromise], and after that we will decide it, step by step.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
