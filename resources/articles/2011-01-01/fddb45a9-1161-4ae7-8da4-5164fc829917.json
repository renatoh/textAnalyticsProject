He seems so much older, darker and sadder, all entirely appropriate to this era. Then, as I pursued the sketch of his biography, I found this: in 2007, the Brooklyn Academy of Music asked him to programme a series of eight films. He chose Hitchcock's very nasty Frenzy; Dr Strangelove; Altman's Brewster McCloud; The Big Clock, a film noir with Charles Laughton; The Seventh Victim, one of Val Lewton's best low-budget horror films; George Romero's Dawn of the Dead; John Frankenheimer's scary Seconds; and Phil Kaufman's 1978 remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. In short, a paradise for paranoia. So it's worth reminding ourselves that the best work Giamatti has done was John Adams in the television mini-series, who was utterly real: stubborn, cantankerous, frustrated, idealistic, ageing, suffering, enduring. A great man, but a pain in the neck. You can say that, in the age of Johnny Depp and George Clooney, Adams was a part from heaven for Giamatti, and the best opportunity he was ever going to get. He works ferociously hard in movies, but he has the looks, the hunted feeling and the paranoia of a lifelong supporting actor who knows he's never going to get a Batman or a Pirates of the Caribbean (unless it's as a villain). But, these days, would you rather watch Depp or Giamatti? You don't have to answer, but if I'd been making The Tourist I'd have thrown Depp in the canal and told Angelina Jolie to do her love scenes with Giamatti. Anyone that gloomy is bound to be sexy. I mean Paul, not Angelina (though she could be a downer, too). Some of us were treasuring Giamatti long ago, when he was just a kid, the son of A Bartlett Giamatti, another noble man, the president of Yale and the commissioner of Major League Baseball (he died in 1989, aged only 51). Paul had small parts in Donnie Brasco, The Truman Show, Saving Private Ryan, Cradle Will Rock and Man on the Moon. He was always good value, but usually there for only a few scenes. His tide turned in 2003 when he played the comic-book writer Harvey Pekar in American Splendor. The next year he was Miles in Sideways, the small independent film by Alexander Payne about wine and its lovers that won Giamatti many awards and changed his name recognition. Then in 2005 he was the trainer to heavyweight champ Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) in Ron Howard's Cinderella Man, and that won him an Oscar nomination as best supporting actor. He had arrived. Or had he? In practice, life went on much as before, with too many producers and directors scratching their heads and asking: can a guy like that carry a big picture? So in 2008 he carried John Adams instead, and won the Emmy as lead actor in a mini-series or movie (if only American theatrical movies were as ambitious or as grown-up). Not that the prizes turned his head or made him a snob. Giamatti has laboured on in pictures \u2013 Big Momma's House, The Illusionist, Lady in the Water, Fred Claus, Duplicity, The Last Station \u2013 and he never lets anyone down. Now he's back in Barney's Version (taken from the Mordecai Richler novel and directed by Richard J Lewis), a real project, a part worthy of him, and already the recipient of a Golden Globe nomination. But is it the kind of film a lot of people will see? Then there is the future. Giamatti is playing Colonel Tom Parker (with Ron Perlman as Elvis!) in something called Bubba Nosferatu: Curse of the She-Vampires, directed by horror director Don Coscarelli, in which Elvis falls among a coven of vampires, which sounds crazy enough to be promising. Beyond that, Giamatti wants to act in and produce The Owl in Daylight, in which he will play the author Philip K Dick. That sounds like the kind of venture an actor could grow very old and sad trying to set up. But as I told you, Paul Giamatti is surprisingly young."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
