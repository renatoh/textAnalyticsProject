But now the soundtrack of office life is one of endless chatter. We talk across desks, in corridors, around water coolers, over coffee. We talk on the phone at our desks, and as we walk along the street. We talk in meetings and workshops. We never shut up. How times have changed. When a telephone was first installed in the Guardian's City office, the chief subeditor reportedly insisted that the infernal thing be placed in a separate room and the door kept shut so that the quiet of the newsroom would not be fractured. Today, newspaper offices are hardly sanctuaries of silence, except perhaps at lunchtime. The rise in the number of people working one day a week from home is traditionally explained by the desire to avoid commuting, or to manage childcare. But surely the biggest motivation is simply to get a moment's peace and quiet. And not all the talk is shop. Co-workers may be discussing their work, but are equally likely to be sharing holiday plans or gossip, comparing notes on the news or The Sopranos, or discussing a new romance. We talk to each other as friends, because increasingly we are: work is becoming the crucible of modern friendship, the place where mates are made. The strengthening of workplace friendships flies in the face of the so-called \"short-termism\" and low-trust nature of the labour market. The sociologist Ray Pahl, in his new book, Friendship, says \"employment... is more flexible and is perceived to be insecure, and the reduction of the importance of the psychological contract between employer and employee - that is, the exchange of security for loyalty - leads to a low-trust environment. As employees are encouraged to watch their own backs and be prepared to move on, they are less likely to trust and make friends with colleagues from work.\" But the evidence is to the contrary. A third of us make most of our friends at work, with women the most likely to find friends there. There are good reasons for this. Fewer of us are likely to make friends through community groups because fewer of us are involved in them: work is now the primary mixing point. At the same time, more people are choosing jobs that suit them rather than simply following a set course. So more and more like-minded people are working together. It shouldn't come as such a shock if we befriend some of them. Even if jobs are more short-term - which is a big if, given that average job tenure has barely moved in 20 years - there is no reason why this should rule out friendship. Few people would describe friendships formed at university as lacking in authenticity, even though they, too, are based on a short-term shared experience. But all that talk, even among friends, doesn't necessarily amount to a conversation. Talking is about swapping data, while \"real conversation\", as the writer Theodore Zeldin puts it, \"catches fire. It involves more than sending or receiving information. Conversation does not simply reshuffle the cards. It creates new cards.\" Zeldin believes that better conversations are the key to better lives - and nowhere is this more true than at work. Right now, much of the chatter is empty - not least the talking between managers and the managed. So many of the open sessions run by companies to facilitate dialogue with staff consist of senior managers informing junior managers about the financials and latest strategy wheezes, in order for them to inform their staff, and so on. More honesty between those at the top and those lower down could help create conversational companies. And they, in the long run, will be more productive for all of us. This is the light in which companies should view the new European legislation that obliges firms to consult their staff over any major changes, rather than simply as another \"burden on business\" - rather like describing your boyfriend's desire to talk about your relationship as a burden on girlfriends. Talk has become cheap. But conversation is priceless. \u0095 Richard Reeves (rreeves@indsoc.co.uk) writes fortnightly.
