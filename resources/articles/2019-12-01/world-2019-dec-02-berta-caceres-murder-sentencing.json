C\u00e1ceres, a winner of the Goldman prize for environmental defenders, was shot dead late at night on 2 March 2016 \u2013 two days before her 45th birthday \u2013 after a long battle to stop construction of an internationally financed hydroelectric dam on the Gualcarque River. In November 2018, the court ruled the murder was ordered by executives of the Agua Zarca dam company, Desa, because of delays and financial losses linked to protests led by C\u00e1ceres. On Monday, more than a year after the guilty verdict, the four paid hitmen \u2013 Elvin Rapalo, Edilson Duarte Meza, \u00d3scar Torres, and Henry Javier Hern\u00e1ndez \u2013 were each given 34 years for the murder. They were also sentenced to 16 years and four months for the attempted murder of Gustavo Castro, a Mexican environmentalist who was shot in the same attack but survived by playing dead. Sergio Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez, the communities and environment manager for Desa, and Douglas Geovanny Bustillo, a former Desa security chief and ex-US trained army lieutenant, were given 30 years and six months for their participation in the murder. Mariano D\u00edaz Ch\u00e1vez, a US-trained special forces major who served with Bustillo, was found guilty by omission and given 30 years. In last year\u2019s five-week trial, wiretap conversations suggested that D\u00edaz participated in reconnaissance missions with Bustillo, and in February 2015 provided logistical support and a gun for a plot to kill C\u00e1ceres. That attempt was aborted at the last minute because she was at home with her daughters. At the time, D\u00edaz \u2013 an army major on active service and in line for promotion to lieutenant colonel \u2013 was under investigation for drug trafficking and kidnapping. Monday\u2019s sentences were welcomed by C\u00e1ceres\u2019s family and supporters as an important step, but outside court they reiterated demands that justice be delivered against the masterminds and financiers of the plot. \u201cFrom the outset, the path to justice has been painful, as our rights as victims have not been respected. These sentences are a start in breaking the impunity, but we\u2019re going to make every effort to ensure that all those responsible \u2013 the company executives and state officials identified in the trial \u2013 are prosecuted,\u201d said Bertita Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, C\u00e1ceres\u2019 second-eldest daughter. C\u00e1ceres, the coordinator of the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (Copinh), was best known for defending indigenous territory and natural resources, but she was also a respected political analyst, women\u2019s rights defender and anti-capitalist campaigner. David Roberto Castillo, a US-trained former military intelligence officer and Desa\u2019s president, has been indicted as an \u201cintellectual author\u201d of her murder. Castillo was arrested on the second anniversary of the murder and is alleged to have coordinated with, and provided funds to, the killers. This year, C\u00e1ceres\u2019 children applied to a US federal court to subpoena bank records linked to a $1.4m luxury house in Texas purchased by Castillo eight months after the killing, arguing the documents could help identify yet unknown individuals involved in the crime. Castillo has also been indicted on multiple corruption charges linked to the Agua Zarca dam concession, which was awarded without proper consultation or environmental assessment. He denies any wrongdoing and insists that he and C\u00e1ceres were friends. Construction of the 21-megawatt dam stopped after the murder, but the licence has not been revoked. The Agua Zarca dam was among scores of environmentally destructive mega-projects sanctioned after the 2009 coup, which ushered in a pro-business government that unleashed a wave of repression against communities who opposed the plans. C\u00e1ceres\u2019s murder triggered widespread condemnation but failed to stop the bloodshed: at least 24 environmental and land defenders have been murdered since March 2015, and Honduras remains one of the most dangerous countries in the world outside an official warzone. Meanwhile, the National party remains in power despite mounting allegations of election fraud, illegal campaign financing and links to drug trafficking."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
