A tight hamstring and quad muscle reported by their first-choice wicketkeeper, Jos Buttler, during the pre-match warm-up for the fourth one-day international led to the Yorkshireman being parachuted into the side on his home ground at the last minute. What followed was a fine individual performance from the understudy in the tightest match of a largely one-sided series, as Bairstow followed up a stumping in Pakistan\u2019s first innings with an unflustered 61 in England\u2019s run chase, breaking the back of the target in a stand of 103 for the fifth wicket with Ben Stokes . With Buttler\u2019s injury not thought to be serious, there is every chance Bairstow will return to the sidelines for the final match in Cardiff but, while the 26-year-old \u2013 England\u2019s incumbent in the Test side \u2013 would naturally be disappointed by the demotion, he accepts it is the nature of being part of a highly competitive setup at present. Bairstow said: \u201cAbout 32 minutes before the start of play, [head coach] Trevor Bayliss said, \u2018You\u2019re in.\u2019 I had prepared as if I was 12th man but I did come in early to have a bat and did my prep for the next few days. But then it was a case of getting my gloves cracking on. You don\u2019t have a choice when you keep wicket and you\u2019re fielding first. \u201cNaturally, it\u2019s frustrating [not to be first choice] but it\u2019s fantastic to be in a squad that is doing so well. The way we are going about our one-day cricket at the minute, it\u2019s a special group of players that believe we can go a long way in world competitions and series. \u201cIt\u2019s something that, if I get an opportunity, I want to impress. That\u2019s all I can do. Keeping wicket, as specialist batter, No1 or No11, every time you go out there you try and do your best. The opportunities are few and far between but you just take it on the chin, crack on and, when one comes along, you take it.\u201d \u201cSelection is above my pay grade but I would like to think when I come in I contribute. I would be desperately disappointed if I didn\u2019t play at Cardiff but that\u2019s me as a person and my will to want to play for England in every format. It\u2019s not nice out of the side.\u201d On Bairstow\u2019s predicament the England captain, Eoin Morgan, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not easy when there are guys challenging for places every game. Jonny Bairstow stood out like a sore thumb; he was outstanding. He\u2019s finding it hard to get into a good side, which is good sign for us.\u201d The Pakistan coach, Mickey Arthur, admitted after the defeat that his side have been unable to compete with England in terms of depth in the batting and offered support to their captain, Azhar Ali, who is facing calls for his removal back home. Arthur said: \u201cEngland are a phenomenal cricket team, with power hitters all the way down. We haven\u2019t been able to get quick starts and clear the ropes. We just don\u2019t have the players to do that within our group of 15 at the moment. Those are things we need to address and bear in mind for the next series. \u201cI want to back Azhar Ali. He\u2019s been fantastic in the changing room and he has respect. He\u2019s doing a fine job.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
