Whitehall sources confirmed yesterday that Mr Middleton, Railtrack's technical director at the time the company was placed in administration by transport secretary Stephen Byers, was considered to be the most likely person to lead the public trust company. Mr Middleton has been a railwayman for 26 years. After privatisation, he left BR to join Railtrack and became a zonal director and then its commercial director. In a boardroom battle, he lost out to newcomer Jonson Cox, brought in from the water industry by Railtrack's former chief executive, Gerald Corbett, to head up the company's operations. Mr Middleton threatened to quit but was made technical director. The government's policy is to roll forward and promote a small group of Railtrack executive directors into the most senior jobs. However, industry sources warned last night that the government would only be promoting people who have been directly responsible for Railtrack's appalling record since privatisation. They said that this would solve no problems and leave Railtrack virtually in the control of the same people. The sources point out that one of Mr Middleton's tasks was to negotiate the west coast main line contract, whose costs have more than trebled in three years. Industry sources said that it could be well over a year before the administrators were able to extricate a new Railtrack from the complex legal contracts with other parts of the privatised network - a move that will cost the government millions of pounds in legal fees. The government also faces a possible threat from the thousands of angry shareholders who will attempt to secure compensation for the loss of their investment in Railtrack. Some claimed that they had been robbed by a \"dishonest\" government. As institutional investors holding around 35% of Railtrack equity continued to press for an early meeting with Mr Byers, action groups representing small shareholders began exploring the legal options that might be open to them. The shareholders, including hundreds of rail workers, are being represented as two groups by the law firms, Edwin Coe and Class Law. Many of the investors acquired their stakes when the network was privatised in 1996. Stephen Alexander, senior partner of Class Law, said his firm was taking \"two or three calls a minute\" from Railtrack investors. He claimed around 3,500 shareholders had joined the action group the firm is leading. He said the group was analysing Railtrack's flotation prospectus in detail to determine whether investors were given a true picture of the company when it was privatised. Mr Alexander said: \"The real state of the railways was not fully disclosed and investors were not made aware of their potential liabilities. Hatfield showed that the network was in a far worse condition than was set out in the prospectus.\" At a separate meeting organised by solicitors Edwin Coe, shareholders hit out at what they claimed was the misappropriation of the company's assets. The company warned that the government would be likely to fight any legal action \"all the way\". The costs of suing for compensation could run into millions, but the cost to individuals could be as low as \u00a350."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
