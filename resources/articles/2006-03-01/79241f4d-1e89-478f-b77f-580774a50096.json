Having trailed to Phil O'Donnell's opener, the goals from Chris Killen and Stephen Glass that took Hibs ahead were an unexpected bonus from play that was generally well below the standard of which they are capable. To produce the artistry that has been a feature of much of their work this season, Hibs seem to require a stimulus they were never likely to encounter at a half-full Fir Park on a bitingly cold day. For most of the time the atmosphere appeared to impair movement, the Edinburgh team as a consequence lacking the fluency that often brings them spectacular goals and extraordinary results. While it may have been understandable that they would take some time to warm up, given the climate, Tony Mowbray's team went to extremes, failing to cross the halfway line into Motherwell territory in the opening nine minutes. When they finally did, there were glimpses of the inventive and perceptive passing of which they are often capable, but they did not come close to contriving opportunities to match those of the home team. Indeed, having caused a few alarms early in the match, Motherwell deserved to be ahead through O'Donnell's strike close to the interval. The former Celtic and Sheffield Wednesday player had already been involved in the scares around the Hibs goal. Indeed, his clever pass to Richie Foran would have led to his team scoring earlier, but for an excellent save from Zibi Malkowski, the Hibs goalkeeper diving left to push the ball wide. But when Scott McDonald, an ever-mobile nuisance in the Motherwell attack, brushed off Gary Caldwell on his way into the left side of the penalty area and delivered the low cutback, O'Donnell hit the ball with the inside of his right foot far to the left of Malkowski. Curiously, Hibs managed to equalise without having to do too much. Indeed, they were fortunate not to have fallen two goals behind seconds before. Gary Caldwell's careless pass straight to McDonald allowed the striker to carry the ball into the right side of the area, from where his drive was blocked by Malkowski. The loose ball fell to O'Donnell, whose follow-up shot was headed for a corner by the recovering Caldwell. Hibs were not as wasteful with what was their first authentic scoring opportunity. A long pass from defence was headed out by Killen towards the dead-ball line on the right. Players without Ivan Sproule's pace would have struggled to prevent the goal-kick, but the striker arrived in time to deliver a low cross to the far post. Killen, utterly free of a challenge, was there to push the ball over the line almost from under the crossbar. But Hibs' unusual vulnerability at the back, where Caldwell had an uncharacteristically uncertain game, left them exposed once again, this time to Brian McLean's powerful header from a corner on the right, but David Murphy stood fast under the bar to head the ball clear. Steven Fletcher's arrival in place of the largely ineffective Paul Dalglish brought Hibs more balance, but the goal that gave them the lead still came as something of a surprise, the general play by then having settled down in midfield, with little hint of a threat at either end. Killen, however, held the ball well in a forward position before supplying Glass, whose run through the inside-left channel ended with his low, left-foot shot across Colin Meldrum and into the far corner of the net. Craigan's late, late left-foot shot from close range after a blocked shot from Brian Kerr gave the scoreline a more just appearance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
