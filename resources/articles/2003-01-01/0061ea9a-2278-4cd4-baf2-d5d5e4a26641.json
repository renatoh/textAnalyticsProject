After almost a decade of loyal devotion, the curly-coated retriever cross was replaced by her half sister, the two-and-a-half-year-old Sadie. Throughout the years, Lucy has become a familiar public face, accompanying the home secretary in his everyday life. \"She has gone through oppositions, governments, boring meetings, exciting times, all sorts of things\", Mr Blunkett said. As he said goodbye to Lucy, he remembered how she walked out of the Commons at William Hague's last prime minister's questions: \"She got up, shook herself, went out of the chamber and went down the corridor - she knew it was an end of an era.\" Lucy's period in parliament will go down in history for an episode in March 1999. She vomited on the carpet during a speech by the then shadow education secretary, David Willetts, nearly suspending the debate but, happily, the vomit was cleaned up while Commons business continued. Now, after having fulfilled her active-life obligations, she will move away from the hustle of London, opting for a quiet life in Bolton, where she will live with her former trainer and new owner, Val Woolrich, of the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association. As for Mr Blunkett, he will be regularly informed about how Lucy is doing, Ms Woolrich assured. Having trained Sadie as well, she said she believes the new dog has the ideal features suitable with the home secretary's life and personality. Being a \"workaholic\", she will fit his busy work schedule. \"Sadie is very spirited, a real character. She's very outgoing, she is inquisitive but not fazed by anything and that reminded me of Lucy at that stage of her life. She's very adaptable to different situations and very quick to learn\", she said. For Mr Blunkett, it is going to be a difficult change, having said in his autobiography that saying goodbye to Lucy would be enough to break his heart and bring tears to his eyes. \"Here I am, so-called hard man, the unbending home secretary, and a dog can bring tears to my eyes,\" Mr Blunkett said, as he posed for photographers with both dogs, introducing Sadie to the media. Sadie's \"job\" with Mr Blunkett starts this weekend and she has already been introduced to the complex geography of the houses of parliament. According to Mr Blunkett, It will take about four months for Sadie to get used to parliamentary life."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
