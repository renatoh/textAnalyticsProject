Spurs have became the first Premier League club since the introduction of the transfer window in 2003 not to recruit any players during the summer period. They play their opening match against Newcastle on Saturday, but Pochettino said he is happy entering a new season with the same players who finished the last one. \u201cI am happy to keep all the squad together,\u201d he said. \u201cThe club made a massive effort to try to extend contracts with people like Harry Kane. I think the club is doing amazing effort to try to finish the stadium as soon as possible and the lodge finished at the training ground. It\u2019s a massive effort from the club. \u201cSometimes in football you need to behave differently. If we are happy with our squad and cannot improve, sometimes it\u2019s better to keep our squad together. Now we have players who compete at a high level in the World Cup, now we have the captain of the world champions, now we have the player who is the Golden Boot. I am sure we are going to be better, no doubt about that.\u201d At the end of last season, Pochettino called on the club hierarchy to be brave this summer. Most took that to mean he wanted more investment in the squad but Pochettino now denies that interpretation and claims the opposite outcome was the result of courage. \u201cWe are a club whose decision was not to sign, [even though] it is the fashion to sign,\u201d he said. \u201cThat maybe looks bad, because of the perception and because of the history of football, but that is our decision \u2013 to keep the best players and to keep the squad. It is a brave decision.\u201d While they failed to add players, Spurs did not have any leave the club. Elsewhere in Europe clubs still have three weeks to do business and players such as Danny Rose, who has been linked with a loan move to Schalke, and Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 may yet find a new employer. But Pochettino had a message for those who might have hoped to move: now is the time to knuckle down. \u201cIt is human nature to always look after yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after the window closes you need to change your mind and think about the team. You need to give your best. I am the boss and if I expect you to do something, then you need to provide it. You need to show your commitment, from the pitch, from the bench, sometimes from outside. That\u2019s what being professional means.\u201d Aston Villa\u2019s Jack Grealish, after being denied a move to Spurs, tweeted: \u201cLet\u2019s get to work\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
