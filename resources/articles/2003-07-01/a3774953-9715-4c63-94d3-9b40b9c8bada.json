Irishman Egan attracted criticism in some quarters for the ride he gave Double Obsession in the King George V Stakes at the Royal meeting last month, when he was always to the fore in a fast-run race before fading. However, Ron Huggins, Double Obsession's owner, saw enough for Egan to warrant another attempt in the O2 Handicap. Double Obsession, trained by Mark Johnston, sat patiently behind the leader, Corton, the mount of Keiren Fallon, until edging ahead approaching the final furlong of the mile-and-a-half contest and staying on dourly to prevail by half a length. Huggins felt Egan, who last month was riding for him for only the second time in 10 years, had been unfortunate in the way the race unfolded at Royal Ascot, prompting him to attack over three furlongs out. He said: \"We wanted to have him on again as he's such a sensitive jockey. We had said last time to him to keep him real handy, but they went such a lick that all the others who were fancied were out the back.\" Egan said: \"I thought I should have run a lot closer at the Royal meeting, and had I done so he'd have been an even money shot there. \"But I was very happy to ride a winner for Mr Huggins as I rode a winner for him 10 years ago, and had one ride for him since. That was this horse at the Royal meeting. It was very kind of him to give me another chance after going too soon the last time.\" Fallon had earlier filled the runner-up spot on Tychy behind Mick Channon's Master Robbie and apprentice Sam Hitchcott in the Rendezvous Casino Rated Stakes. However, the champion had previously treated racegoers to a virtuoso performance in forcing favourite Hawk Flyer home in front in the three-runner Woodcote Stud Classified Stakes. Hawk Flyer, the 11-10 favourite, produced a renewed effort under Fallon's drive to head Prince Nureyev in the final strides and prevail by a neck. \"It was two tough horses, and mine got there at the finish,\" said Fallon. \"He knew where the winning post was, didn't he?\" Fallon completed a double thanks to River Belle, who made a winning debut for trainer Alan Jarvis in the Woodcote Stud Maiden Fillies' Stakes. He returned with blood smearing the bridge of his nose, the result of contact with the filly's head as the stalls opened."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
