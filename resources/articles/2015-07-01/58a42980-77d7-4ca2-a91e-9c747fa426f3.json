But while Merchant is a perfectly capable actor and Bean\u2019s play, first seen in a National Theatre experimental season, has a peculiar charm, I can\u2019t help feeling that a modest piece has been inflated to make a pricey West End star vehicle. Bean presents us with a distinctly odd couple who have taken a north London hotel room for the night. Ted, a middle manager for an industrial cleaning company, is an angry prophet who has a message for the world. Influenced by the theories of the American psychologist BF Skinner, he wants to create a community of a thousand people based, as he says, \u201con cleanliness, good behaviour and sleeping with your own wife\u201d. His chosen accomplice is Morrie, a fantasising hairdresser and part-time cameraman, specialising in soft porn, whose job is to tape Ted\u2019s utopian vision in order to attract potential acolytes. Bean\u2019s play is obviously full of echoes. Ted is strongly reminiscent of the bedsit revolutionary in David Halliwell\u2019s Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs, now being revived at Southwark Playhouse. Notes thrust under the hotel door also evoke Pinter\u2019s The Dumb Waiter, and the climatic use of the clippers suggests Willy Russell\u2019s Educating Rita. But Bean shrewdly holds back the revelation of the real bond between Ted and Morrie, shows a wry compassion for life\u2019s loners and misfits, and peppers his dialogue with funny lines. I especially liked Morrie\u2019s vision of the father he clearly never had who \u201cwas the only British boxer to have boxed at every weight\u201d. Merchant himself, however, draws attention to what the play needs when he says, in an interview in the programme, that Ted would have been a perfect role for Tony Hancock: you can just imagine Hancock filling the part with his own brand of suburban paranoia. My only complaint about Merchant is that he seems almost too normal and nice. He is very good at conveying Ted\u2019s vulnerability and need for protection, twisting his long, beanpole body into extraordinary shapes as he seeks to impart his message. But Bean\u2019s character is a borderline psychotic in the grip of an ungovernable obsession that Merchant suggests but never fully embodies. Steffan Rhodri is, however, extremely good as the equally complex Morrie. He reels off his palpable fictions, such as knowing Bill Gates when he sold sandwiches off the back of a pushbike in the Seven Sisters Road, with total conviction. Rhodri also hints subtly at the sexual ambivalence of a man who blokishly boasts of his hetero conquests, yet who seems currently attached to a female impersonator and who is clearly driven by a wayward affection for the evangelising Ted. It all makes for a strange evening. I like Bean\u2019s play and have no quarrel with Abbey Wright\u2019s production. But what might make a perfect small-scale show comes equipped with a needless interval and the false expectations aroused by the presence of a popular comic dipping his toe into the icy waters of straight acting. At Wyndham\u2019s theatre, London until 26 September. Box Office: 0844 482 5125."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
