These big-city folk were sent there by the party in the Sixties as part of the 'Third Line of Defence'. This benign though still coercive aspect of the Cultural Revolution was designed to disperse essential industries in the face of a threatened Soviet invasion. More sophisticated and skilled than the locals, the newcomers never put down roots and live in the hope of returning home. Their children have grown up in these remote parts and, to the horror of their parents, are making friends with the inferior locals, even thinking of marrying them. The movie centres on the discontented, deeply depressed Wu Zemin, who's as protective as a Victorian or a Muslim father when it comes to his beautiful 19-year-old daughter, Qinghong. He's determined that she'll go to college in Shanghai or Beijing and escape from the stultifying provincial life that is destroying his marriage and suffocating the spirits of his circle of friends. The effect of Wu Zemin's well-intentioned restrictions on her life prove to be tragic. There are infinitely sad scenes in this beautifully observed film. The kids imitate their Western contemporaries, wearing bell-bottom trousers (which are cut off with shears by angry schoolteachers) and dancing to bootleg tapes of Boney M. Their fathers listen to Voice of America ('the only reliable source of news') and discuss the flavour of precious imported Kent cigarettes sent from Shanghai. A recurrent image is that of Qinghong sitting silently on the bed of her small room while, in the foreground, her father storms up and down in the corridor outside. There's also a poignant emblem of hope and desire in the red high-heeled shoes a local boy gives her and which her father throws away in disgust. Right at Your Door, the directorial debut of production designer Chris Gorak, is a post-9/11 disaster movie set in Los Angeles but made in the manner not of Earthquake but of Peter Watkins's 1965 anti-nuke TV film, The War Game, which the BBC banned because it encouraged despair. Within five minutes of the opening, dirty bombs explode in LA airport, Beverly Hills and Century City, and we see the effects of the ensuing panic on four people. They're a young musician and a Hispanic handyman, who follow radio instructions and seal themselves up in the former's house, and the musician's wife and a little black schoolboy, who have been contaminated by radioactive dust and are thus stranded outside. Masked troops come in to restore order, human compassion is suspended and the rest of the country is fed comforting lies. This is a tough, pitiless film. Snow Cake is a contrived Anglo-Canadian co-production exuding a self-conscious sensitivity and starring Alan Rickman as a lonely, middle-aged Englishman making a sentimental journey across wintry Canada for a reunion with the woman who 20 years before bore him a son he's never seen. He gives a lift to a kookie teenage hitchhiker who's killed beside him in a crash and he's stuck for several days in a small town, where he tracks down the girl's autistic mother (Sigourney Weaver). As he copes with and cares for her, he has an affair with a liberated woman (Carrie-Anne Moss) and as the snow melts, he thaws emotionally. It's dull, unrevealing, well acted and gives Weaver one of those roles as a handicapped person with special gifts and insights that begs for and frequently receives Oscar nominations. Snow Cake is a UK Film Council production made with lottery money, as is the dreadful coming-of-age comedy Driving Lessons, based on the experiences of Jeremy Brock, its writer-director, as the teenage son of a vicar given a holiday job working for Dame Peggy Ashcroft. Here, 17-year-old Ben (attractively played by Rupert Grint, the carrot-topped chum of Harry Potter) is a would-be poet, whose mother (Laura Linney) is a religious maniac with a deep contempt for her withdrawn husband (a cleric obsessed with ornithology) and having it off with a happy-clappy young evangelical priest. None of this rings true and even less so does the escape Ben finds as summer holiday companion to Dame Evie Walton (a wildly indulgent performance by Julie Walters), a dotty old thespian living in squalor in Hampstead, who drinks like a fish and swears like - well, like a trouper. Though Ben hasn't got a licence, she tricks him into driving her to perform at the Edinburgh Book Festival, their journey taking them along narrow mountain roads, and he's introduced to alcohol and sex. A cross between 'Driving Miss Luvvie' and a Children's Film Foundation remake of Sunset Boulevard, it's an embarrassment. Beerfest is a crude, puerile comedy from a team of five old college chums who work as a team called Broken Lizard and it centres on a beer-drinking contest between five boozy Americans and five arrogant Germans at a secret rendezvous during Munich's annual Oktoberfest. Cloris Leachman reprises her comic Germans from Young Frankenstein and High Anxiety, and the film is bookended by brief guest appearances by Donald Sutherland and Willie Nelson, who tells a dirty joke. At 112 minutes, it's wildly overextended. Scripted by Wes Craven, set in Ohio and shot in Romania, Pulse is a turgid remake of Kiyoshi Kurosawa's second-rate Japanese horror film in which ghosts emerge from computers to take over the bodies and souls of their users. It's a metaphor, a cautionary tale and the tedium is the message. More interesting and far stranger is Earthlings, a brief, low-budget documentary. The talking heads on display belong to a circle of oddball characters from more than 50 countries, some of them highly intelligent and articulate, who communicate with each other in Klingon, a language created by Marc Okrand, a linguistics scholar, for Star Trek movies. One of the speakers taught his son Klingon before he learnt English."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
