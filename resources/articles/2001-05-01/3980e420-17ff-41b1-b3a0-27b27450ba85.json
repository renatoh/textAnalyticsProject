In today's Candidate: the main parties squabble over the euro, the Candidate travels north, and we explain the link between the siege of Troy and Tory health policy. ***VIEW FROM THE LOBBY*** Guardian political correspondent Nicholas Watt reports from the Bank Holiday press conferences: \"The Tories devoted their press conference this morning to their Keep the Pound message. They've decided that they're going to devote most of the last ten days of their campaign to it - saying that if you vote Conservative, the pound will be safe with them, but Labour will scrap it. \"In order to reinforce their message they said two things: firstly, that if Labour does go ahead and hold a referendum on the euro, and that we then lose the pound, the currency changeover will cost \u00a336bn. That is a highly contentious figure. It's produced by an accountancy firm called Chantry Vellacott, and as Gordon Brown pointed out in his press conference this morning, if you actually look at the report the authors say that there is some dispute over exactly how much it will cost. Indeed, there was a report by another accountancy firm which said that the benefits of joining the euro - companies no longer having to change money and work out what exchange rates are going to be - could outweigh the costs. \"The second message the Conservatives put over was that if Tony Blair does hold a referendum on the euro, he will rig it. They say he will run it in such a way that people will be either scared or will just be intimidated into voting to scrap to pound. Once again, this is a highly controversial and contentious thing to say, because Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, said yesterday that he would be in favour of a simple question on the euro: \"Are you in favour of the euro - yes or no?\" That is hardly rigging a referendum. \"In contrast to the big constitutional issues highlighted by the Tories, Labour's press conference concentrated on bread and butter issues. They announced that, if elected, they would introduce changes to the way the lottery was allocated to ensure that extra funds go to deprived areas of Britain. There's a feeling that the sort of areas that do well out of lottery funding are wealthy areas, where people know how to work the system, and that more deprived areas have lost out. What Labour wants to do is to push \u00a3150m of Lottery money towards the areas that have lost out.\" ***POLL OF POLLS*** Lab: 49% Con: 31% LibDem: 14% Other: 6% What this would mean: a projected Lab majority of 255.

The Tories claim that any referendum on the euro would be rigged by Labour. ***CAMPAIGN DIARY*** Labour candidate Paul Richards canvasses in his Lewes constituency and meets a disaffected Conservative peer, an anti-German war veteran, and historian Asa Briggs. http://politics.theguardian.com/campaigndiary/story/0,9394,497658,00.html ***GRUMBLING MINOR OF THE DAY*** \"It doesn't make any difference whichever party's in. We don't see the benefit,\" whinged a young wouldn't-be voter in Hartlepool this morning. Coming tomorrow: the seven-year-old who explains why, contrary to Tony Blair's speech on Friday, patriotism and a desire for European unity are in fact incompatible. ***GETTING OUT THE VOTE*** This weekend, the Candidate switched off Sky News, turned off her mobile and headed north for a spot of canvassing and local campaigning. A whistlestop tour took her to Stalybridge and Hyde, now likely to be won by former No 10 policy wonk, James Purnell, and on to Rochdale, a key Labour marginal currently held by Lorna Fitzsimons but targeted by the Lib Dems. She ended up in Hartlepool, the home of former minister and New Labour co-founder Peter Mandelson, and wants to debunk a few myths about this election: Myth 1: No-one knows about it. Nonsense. In working class council estates in Rochdale and Hartlepool, the residents were very aware of the campaign. Myth 2: The public don't believe this election can change their lives. Again, nonsense. The voters realise the options open to them, and in a sense they are more politicised than in 1997, when it was just about teaching the Tories a lesson. Now they acknowledge that there is a genuine choice between investment in public services and lower taxes. Myth 3: The voters are more apathetic and disillusioned with politicians than ever before. True, as always, some people are politically disengaged, but the overwhelming majority want to discuss the issues; there were constant complaints and comments about the council, schools and the health service. Myth 4: This has been a boring election. Wherever the Candidate made an appearance, there was no mention of the events which are meant to bore the London establishment. Battlebuses, spin doctors and even sleaze didn't get a mention. What does this tell the Candidate? Politicians need to completely reassess how they run election campaigns. The public want to discuss politics, but not in the way we imagine down in the smoke. Bun fights on the TV news are not what people want. They want to be talked to as adults, presented with the arguments and given a choice. The media, too, have a role to play in explaining what's on offer in a way that is easy to understand. This can't simply be done through long interviews with politicians - or worse, glib soundbites - it needs to be part of all news coverage. A TV debate is clearly one of the best opportunities to achieve this, and it's a pity that the prime minister refuses to get involved. ***EXTRA GREEK*** The Candidate is delighted that its efforts to raise the tone of the election campaign have borne fruit. Our recent invitation to compose a better title for the Conservative manifesto - inspired by Michael Portillo's Latin interjection during a press conference - produced some extremely erudite suggestions from readers. Now the Labour Party has followed our lead with the launch of its Name The Trojan Horse competition. Shadow health secretary Liam Fox recently referred to his Patients' Guarantee as \"the silent revolution... What we are starting is perhaps a Trojan Horse because with the Patients' Guarantee most of them haven't thought through the implications of what we are doing.\" Seizing on the spirited metaphor, Labour built a wooden horse and asked Alan Milburn to unveil it, whereupon four Labour supporters wearing 'Trojan' T-shirts emerged. Mr Milburn then posed nervously next to (but sadly not on) the horse, which sported a handsome blue 'Tory Health Policy: They Will Make You Pay' saddle. Visitors to Labour's website (http://www.labour.org.uk ) are challenged to name the beast. The Candidate rang Labour's HQ to find out the whereabouts of the three-metre-high horse. \"I'm not quite sure,\" said a Labour spokesman. \"But you will be seeing it again.\" ***FLOATING VOTER*** Stupid teenagers on TV claiming government does nothing for young people: 92 Percentage of said teenagers likely to feel same way when they pay tax: 5% Boredom rating: 8/10 Last night, Tony Blair showed a sensitive face to the nation. Fortunately it was that of a seven-year-old schoolchild, and so came across as vaguely convincing. The youngster was part of Labour's third party election broadcast, which showed just how relaxed the premier is amongst normal people, how committed he is to fulfilling their dreams. Earlier the same day, William Hague had stood alone, unsmiling behind a lofty podium and predicted for the countryside \"at best a bleak and uncertain future, and at worst a slow and painful death\". Now for all I know (and my study of the nation's agricultural prospects has not been too thorough), Britain's fields may indeed burst into flame in the next decade. But whether filling the heads of the electorate with visions of doomsday is the best way to get elected is up for debate. The best way to get everyone to stay in bed maybe, but elected? The Tories have stuck to scaring people since day one. (What else are you supposed to do with Ann Widdecombe?) There's been emotive shots of rancid cheese, teenage smackheads on the rampage and now cindered sheep. But when Central Office came up with this brainwave, did they really think through the consequences? That instead of turning William into the Nostradamus of national decline, he ends up looking like Doctor Strangelove, only slightly more mobile? ***TIE WATCH*** **Tony Blair**: A dull navy blue for a visit to Hartlepool. Cherie accompanied her husband, wearing a flattering pale green coat with Burberry checked lining. **Gordon Brown**: Another royal blue tie with white spots for the Chancellor, who took special care today to refer plenty of questions to local government minister Hilary Armstrong. **William Hague**: Mr Hague chose an unfortunate orange and yellow check which clashed unpleasantly with Ffion's pink top. **Charles Kennedy**: For the first time in this election campaign, one of the party leaders has been spotted without a tie. Mr Kennedy wore a white T-shirt, blue shirt and hard hat as he announced Lib Dem environmental initiatives. ***ON TV TONIGHT*** **10.30pm, BBC2**: Newsnight Kirsty Wark stands alone against the political wilderness of Crufts (all evening on BBC2) and an ITV documentary about extreme weather conditions in the solar system. ***FINAL READING*** Matthew Engel watches Michael Portillo in action in Chelsea: \"He is determined never to be Stephen Twigged again.\" http://politics.theguardian.com/election2001/story/0,9029,497611,00.html Have a flutter on the general election result with Bluesquare.
