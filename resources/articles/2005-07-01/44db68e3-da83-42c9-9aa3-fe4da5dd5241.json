The first lasted only a few weeks, the second, Bruce Richmond, nearly four decades. The editorship of Arthur Crook, who has died at the age of 93, was the second longest (1959-74), but for the eight preceding years, with the editor Alan Pryce-Jones abroad a good deal of the time, Arthur was effectively left as acting editor. Arthur, born in London, devoted his entire working life to this one journal, where he started as a 15-year-old office boy - his father was a Times compositor. The only interruption was a brief spell of wartime service in the RAF, from which he was soon invalided out with a bad lung and Bell's Palsy. The one lasting effect of this paralysis of the facial nerve was the appearance of a slight wink: this was not entirely out of character, and if anything added to his considerable charm. He was a most affable man, sociable and extrovert, not at all the kind of person one might have expected to find editing a paper as learned and sometimes drily academic as the TLS could be. TLS contributors under Richmond had included Henry James, TS Eliot, Virginia Woolf, Max Beerbohm and EM Forster, but in the 1930s the paper rather lost its way and was then dumbed down under the wartime editorship of DL Murray. This decline was abruptly reversed with the appointment as editor of Stanley Morison, the great typographer. Morison was a complicated man, as extreme in his Roman Catholicism as in his Marxist leanings, which laid the paper open to accusations of fellow-travelling or even Stalin worship. Though Morison had had no formal further education, he was immensely erudite, and terrified everyone by sheer force of personality. However, he took the young Arthur under his wing and brought him on. In Morison's old age, Crook showed filial piety to his old mentor. Under Pryce-Jones, the paper became more cosmopolitan - aware of a literary world not just outside Oxbridge but also beyond England and the English language. Arthur built on this foundation with great success. Lacking in intellectual pretensions, he had no chip on his shoulder about not having been to university. On the contrary, he adroitly turned to advantage his lack of an academic or scholarly background by delegating brilliantly. Reading every word of every page of every issue of the TLS throughout his adult life was a pretty good education, but far more important than what he knew was his knowledge of who knew what. He had an astonishing memory for what subjects people could write about. In a time of great literary editors - Terence Kilmartin, Karl Miller, WL Webb - Arthur's knack for matching reviewer and book over a very wide range of subjects was unrivalled. His deputy editor in the 60s was the Brecht translator John Willett, who made a huge contribution, especially in the field of foreign literature. Others on his small staff over the years included Martin Amis, Nicholas Bethell, Alexander Cockburn, Anthony Curtis, George Fraser, Ian Hamilton, Derwent May, Peter Porter, Piers Paul Read and Nicolas Walter. Arthur claimed the paper was never out of profit while he was editor. This was achieved both by a circulation that was higher than after he retired and also by an iron hand on expenditure. The anonymous but often highly distinguished reviewers were paid peanuts. Staff salaries were also microscopic, but the compensation was that working for Arthur was tremendous fun. Elsewhere in Printing House Square, journalists wore suits and ties, called each other Mr and addressed superiors as sir. On the TLS, dress was informal, and the editor was Arthur to everyone. Even in the 60s, this was most unusual. He was quite fussy about timekeeping, and to allow an apostrophe to intrude into the titles of Howards End or Finnegans Wake was a sackable offence, but otherwise you could do much as you liked. Arthur himself led the way by manifestly enjoying every minute of his job. He particularly liked his convivial lunches at the Garrick club, from which he would return mid-afternoon to entertain his staff by retelling the jokes and gossip he had gathered. But even more than the Garrick, the high point of his week was press day, when he could rush about in shirtsleeves, spotting a literal at 10 yards' distance, strewing galley proofs, snatching up page proofs, and - best of all - going down to the din of the composing-room with its clattering linotype machines and making up the letters page on the stone. There was always a part of him that felt that the composing room was where he belonged, like his father before him. He would have hated the change from hot metal to new technology. In fact, as far as the TLS was concerned, he didn't like change very much at all. He was the keeper of the flame, custodian of the journal. He was conservationist rather than conservative, and clever enough to act like Tancredi in Lampedusa's The Leopard, who says, \"For things to remain the same, everything must change.\" And in the 60s the paper did change, enormously, and for the better. But the reviews continued to be unsigned. Anonymity was, for Arthur, the one thing that had to stay. There were powerful advocates on both sides of the argument. Campaigns against anonymity were mounted by such distinguished figures as FW Bateson and Frank Kermode. Arthur was simply inflexible. Inevitably his successor, John Gross, swiftly reversed the policy. Subsequent events have not always proved Arthur wrong. Where he was unquestionably right was in refusing to lower standards in any way, in spite of management pressures to make the paper more \"popular\". In his retirement he was president and chairman of the Royal Literary Fund. He was also a consultant to Times Newspapers (not a very onerous task). There was talk of his working on a history of the TLS, but he had rarely ever put pen to paper, and in old age he did not change his ways. He enjoyed travelling and within the constraints of declining health retained his zest for life. His devoted wife Juliet and his son and two daughters from a previous marriage survive him. \u00b7 Arthur Charles William Crook, editor, born February 16 1912; died July 15 2005"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
