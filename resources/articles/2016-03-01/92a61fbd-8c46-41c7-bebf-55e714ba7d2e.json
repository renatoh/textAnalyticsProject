Over 4,500 people have donated on the GoFundMe page, which was created on Good Friday by some of his customers to raise money for his family. Shah was discovered with serious injuries outside his newsagent shop in the Shawlands area of Glasgow, a few miles south of the city centre, just after 9pm on Thursday. The 40-year-old was taken to Queen Elizabeth University hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Jen Bannerman, a neighbour of the Shah family, said she set up the fundraising page because Shawlands residents were looking for ways to show their support after the tragedy. \u201cMr Shah was a popular, well-respected and much-loved member of our community and his death has devastated many. He was a warm and friendly man and he always went out of his way to make time to talk to you \u2013 he was more than just our local shopkeeper. He was a friend to many. \u201cWe are raising funds for his family to use in whatever way they see most fitting \u2013 whether that be to contribute towards funeral expenses, provide financial security for his family in the coming months, or simply to do something in his memory. We know money will never make up for his loss but this is our way of showing our support for him, and showing his family how much he was cared for in our community.\u201d On Sunday, prominent members of Glasgow\u2019s Muslim community called for calm and solidarity after police confirmed that the man arrested in connection with the killing \u2013 which is being treated as \u201creligiously prejudiced\u201d \u2013 was also a Muslim. Following the revelation, Humza Yousaf, the Scottish government\u2019s only Muslim minister, immediately responded in a tweet: \u201cNo ifs, no buts, no living in denial \u2013 vile cancer of sectarianism needs stamped out wherever it exists \u2013 including amongst Muslims.\u201d Shah, whose final Facebook update, posted a few hours before his death, offered Easter greetings \u201cto my beloved Christian nation\u201d, was a member of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community. This minority Muslim group faces persecution \u2013 most recently in Pakistan and Indonesia \u2013 and is treated with open hostility by many orthodox Muslims. Over the Easter weekend tributes continued to flood in for the shopkeeper, who moved from Pakistan to Scotland in the 1990s and was the eldest of seven siblings. Many Easter Sunday services mentioned him in their prayers, and people have continued to add to the growing bank of flowers, cards and candles near the site of the killing. Shawlands residents who knew him have described a gentle man who cared deeply for his community and every year would print out his own Christmas cards with personal messages for customers. More than 400 people, including Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, attended a candlelit vigil on Friday night organised by two local women \u2013 one Muslim and one Christian \u2013 and publicised on social media with the hashtag #thisisnotwhoweare. Speaking at the event, members of Shah\u2019s family called for Glaswegians to stand side by side. Shah\u2019s Facebook page, which includes videos of him praying and messages of peace, displays a final missive posted on Thursday at 5.10pm. It read: \u201cGood Friday and a very Happy Easter, especially to my beloved Christian nation \u2026 Let\u2019s follow the real footstep of beloved holy Jesus Christ and get the real success in both worlds.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
