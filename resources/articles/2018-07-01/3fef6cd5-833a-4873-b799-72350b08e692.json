We want to help to be well, fine with us. \u201cThe national team didn\u2019t get the results they want but today he is on holiday, and I want him to relax well and I want, when he comes back with us, to start with a good mentality. I want to work with him with a new way and with an ambition to continue with this quality and to help him to get better with the team.\u201d Emery considered the suggestion that \u00d6zil\u2019s inconsistency can be an issue for Arsenal, but his response was to query whether any of Arsenal\u2019s players managed to perform at their best level on a regular basis. \u201cLast year was a difficult year for all the team, not only for Mesut,\u201d he said. \u201cThey finished sixth in the Premier League \u2013 not the position we want. \u201cNow it\u2019s a new way. With all the players I want to give them confidence, to give them a chance every day in their work. With quality work it is very easy to arrive at the performance, individual and collective. Mesut is on holiday and I want him to be tranquil and calm. \u201cWe want the international players to come back quickly and start practising hard with us. But it is also important for them to have holidays because the season is very, very hard and very, very long. They need holidays to come full of energy for the start and to give us this quality and this energy in the team.\u201d \u00d6zil, like all the players, was granted a summer break of between three and four weeks. All those who played at the World Cup but were knocked out in the group stage, like \u00d6zil, are expected to join the club\u2019s pre-season tour to Singapore. The rest, including their new midfielder Lucas Torreira and defender Stephan Lichtsteiner, will have their full break and be integrated closer to the big kick-off in August."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
