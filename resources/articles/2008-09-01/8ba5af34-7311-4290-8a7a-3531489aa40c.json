Paulson spent the weekend urging Congress to authorise his daring bail-out, while Democrats called for extra help for poor households. After a calamitous week in which the fallout from the bankruptcy of venerable Wall Street broker Lehman Brothers threatened to drag down a clutch of other banks, Paulson announced that he wants to use $700bn (\u00a3380bn) of taxpayers' money to buy up toxic mortgage assets, in an attempt to avert full-blown financial meltdown. Speaking at the White House yesterday, George Bush said: 'This is a big package because it was a big problem.' Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama echoed calls for the bail-out package to avoid helping highly paid bank bosses. But analysts are not convinced that Washington's decisive actions will mark an end to the credit crunch. 'On balance, market developments and policy responses are still netting out to a very uncertain path for financial conditions and the economy,' warned Robert DiClemente, of Citigroup. British banks will not benefit directly, and Alistair Darling is under pressure to provide more help to crisis-hit lenders. But after the hastily arranged marriage of HBOS and Lloyds TSB, regulators hope the US plan will begin to restore investors' shattered confidence and give banks a breathing space. Treasury sources insisted that Darling has no intention of adopting a copycat scheme. As calls intensified for Gordon Brown to follow up on his promise to 'clean up' the City with concrete plans for stricter legislation, details emerged of widespread fraud among some of Britain's biggest lenders. Ten banks and building societies have called in the police to investigate systemic and sophisticated mortgage fraud worth more than \u00a360m, The Observer has discovered. Bradford &amp; Bingley alone has written off \u00a315m to criminal gangs who organised frauds involving applications from dishonest or bogus borrowers. Police believe a number of shady brokers and solicitors overstated the value of a large number of houses. The disclosure will raise fears that there are other multi-million pound losses from mortgage fraud yet to be declared by banks and building societies which could affect their stability and balance sheets. A spokesman for the Financial Services Authority, the City's watchdog, confirmed that it is investigating around 300 cases of suspected mortgage fraud. Of those, at least 10, each worth at least \u00a35m, have been referred to the police. Details of one of the frauds have been leaked to The Observer. Bradford &amp; Bingley was stung by a \u00a315m mortgage fraud centred on newly built properties in Surrey, Hampshire and East Sussex. Hundreds of buy-to-let mortgage applications were submitted by a single gang between 2004 and 2007 from fake borrowers and dishonest appraisers. A source close to the bank said its executives were horrified to learn of the fraud at the beginning of this year. 'It was well organised and involved a large number of people. The scam involved newly-built estates and multiple applications for mortgages from \"straw borrowers\". The gang worked with solicitors, surveyors and estate agents who knew exactly what was going on. It slipped through at a time when staff were still being encouraged to sign off buy-to-let mortgages.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
