On this form the 26-year-old winger looks capable of eclipsing the 40 tries scored by Denny Solomona last season to set the competition\u2019s record before he departed for rugby union. This was Eden\u2019s fifth hat-trick in six games \u2013 including a Challenge Cup treble against St Helens \u2013 taking his season\u2019s tally to 30 in 18 league games. Castleford\u2019s coach Daryl Powell, who recruited Eden when he was at a low point following a spell in the National Rugby League with Brisbane, said: \u201cThe people on the inside of him do an outstanding job but he\u2019s an incredible finisher. But we were scratchy in the second half I thought, and Warrington came back at us.\u201d Just as Powell takes great credit over the Eden project, he equally deserves plaudits for turning the Tigers into a side who are the undisputed favourites for the Grand Final at Old Trafford in October. In recent weeks his team have shown an essential hallmark of a championship team by winning when they are below their best. That was never more evident than against St Helens last Sunday and, while mesmerising in patches here, they were again far from perfect yet still ran out comfortable victors. Warrington were the last side to defeat Castleford at home, in July 2016. But the chance of a repeat here was all but over by the end of a frenetic opening quarter in which the Tigers, with prop Andy Lynch playing the 500th game of his career, had opened up a commanding 20-0 lead after the Warrington captain, Chris Hill, had been sent to the sin-bin. That early burst was typical of so many of Castleford\u2019s victories this season where a flurry of points in a short, sharp spell have proved decisive. \u201cIt made it hard to win from there,\u201d the Warrington coach, Tony Smith, said. His team are now 11 points adrift of the top four and it appears their Challenge Cup quarter-final against Wigan on Saturday may well be season-defining. However, there is still the possibility of last season\u2019s beaten grand finalists facing a battle against relegation in the Qualifiers. To illustrate the gulf in class between these two sides, Eden\u2019s five tries here were one fewer than the six Warrington have managed in their past four games combined. The early signs were ominous for Warrington when they fell behind after three minutes as Luke Gale\u2019s kick was claimed by Eden for the first of his haul. Hill\u2019s yellow card proved a pivotal moment, as in his absence Castleford took control of the match with tries from Eden, Greg Minikin and Mike McMeeken. Tom Lineham\u2019s try shortly after Hill\u2019s return reduced the deficit, although only temporarily, with normal service quickly resumed when Eden completed a hat-trick following a looping pass from Junior Moors \u2013 whose knee injury was the only blot on another successful afternoon for the league leaders. The second half was much more closely fought and Warrington managed to score the game\u2019s final two tries through Joe Westerman and Jack Hughes, but by that stage far too much damage had already been done to their cause. Eden scored his fourth and fifth tries and, for a brief moment, it looked like he would become only the second player in Super League history after the Bradford great Lesley Vainikolo to score six in a game. That was not to be but, on this evidence, there are still plenty more to come from him this season.
