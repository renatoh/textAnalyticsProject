Andrew Grant, chair of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, said politicians and other critics of the fee-paying system should be grateful for the money parents are saving for the state sector. And he added that without them \"Britain would not have enough officers to lead its army.\" Referring to Labour MP Alan Milburn's review on social mobility and fair access to the professions, Grant, whose group represents 250 private schools he said : \"He presumably looked at the Sandhurst lists \u2026 and noticed that there wasn't a disappointed queue of candidates from the wrong side of the tracks deprived unfairly of the opportunity to risk their lives leading young men and women in Helmand.\" Political rhetoric implies that to be a loyal citizen is to be \"under a moral obligation to depend as much as possible on the resources of the state, funded by the taxpayer,\" said Grant, headteacher of St Albans school, at the start of the HMC's annual conference in Liverpool. \"I have been wondering how we arrived at a position where to be a member of the self-reliant middle class, to pay your taxes without complaint, but to try to stand on your own feet, to take financial responsibility for your children \u2026 to pay your way honestly, can be widely regarded as somehow tantamount to treason,\" he said. The Charities Act 2006 demands private schools justify their charitable status to retain up to \u00a3100m in tax breaks each year. Under new rules, private schools must offer more educational benefits to pupils from families who are unable to pay fees. This year, two out of five schools inspected by the Charity Commission were told they failed to provide enough bursaries. \"The threat that underlies the guidance is the well-tried medieval one of confiscation of land and property,\" Grant said. \"How dare [politicians] criticise our parents for footing the bill to educate their own children, or seek to make it more difficult for them to do so?\" he added. Politicians \"should be gratefully begging their forgiveness and instructing the Charity Commission in the truth that the more fee-paying parents an independent school can muster, the greater the benefit to the public and the public purse.\" A commission spokesperson said: \"We are surprised by the tone of the speech, which seems at odds with the constructive dialogue we have had with schools.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
