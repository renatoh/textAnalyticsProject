Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative party leader, insisted officials were spinning their version and asked if the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, would be sacked if it became clear he had misled the committee. Mr Blair said it was wrong to make any assumptions until the report was published and it was \"completely untrue\" to suggest someone in Downing Street had leaked the findings to newspapers. Kennedy badgers Blair on WMD Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat leader, asked: \"When President Bush delivered his televised address a couple of days ago to the US, he specifically chose not to refer once to weapons of mass destruction. Can we expect you to follow suit?\" Mr Blair replied: \"No. It's absolutely clear the reasons why we went into the conflict, the evidence on weapons of mass destruction.\" Blair praises Britons in Iraq The prime minister paid tribute to the Britons who have lost their lives doing \"extraordinary and heroic\" work in Iraq, adding: \"The whole country and their families can be immensely proud of them.\" UN role in Iraq The best way to share the burden of Iraq was through the United Nations, said Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman. He told MPs the UK had a moral as well as pragmatic obligation to deal with the deteriorating security situation. However forces in Iraq must be answerable to the UN security council. The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, said the UN should continue to play a \"vital role\" in reconstruction. BBC safe from Gilligan retaliation There will be no question of a \"pay back\" time against the BBC by the government over issues like the Andrew Gilligan Iraq dossier report, said the media minister, Lord McIntosh. He gave the assurance to Lord McNally (Liberal Democrat) who asked how the government would ensure that parliament and the public were fully involved and consulted during the BBC charter renewal. Lord Mcintosh said: \"We will maintain the BBC's independence and not be influenced by matters taking place now.\" Blair plays down EU referendum The outcome of the draft European constitution is \"absolutely fundamental\" but does not merit a referendum, Mr Blair insisted. He said Britain had secured all its vital national interests and would not give any of them up in negotiations on the final version next month. Tory calls for a poll on the issue were a trick to block reform, paralyse the EU and lead to British withdrawal, he warned. Mr Duncan Smith said he was hiding the significance of the constitution from the British people. \"It is absolutely clear that you say one thing to your cabinet and another thing to everyone else. Whether it's the Kelly tragedy or last night's TUC speech you never actually delivered or the deliberate deceit about the European constitution, isn't it true - now as ever it was - no one will ever believe a word you say any more?\" University funding reform to go ahead Mounting opposition to top-up fees will not derail the shakeup of higher education funding, the prime minister vowed after Labour's Iain Luke (Dundee E) urged him to think again. But Mr Blair said that if the government was to meet its target of getting 50% of young people into higher education, changes had to be made to provide more funding. New police powers to prevent underage drinking Additional powers enabling police to clamp down on underage drinking were hailed as \"hugely important\" by Mr Blair. He was responding to Labour's Mark Tami (Alyn and Deeside) who said anti-social behaviour, often fuelled by underage drinking, continued to blight many areas. Crackdown on unfit meat The government will take \"every possible action\" to stamp out rackets involving illegal meat products, the prime minister pledged. His comments follow conviction of six men who butchered one million unfit chickens and turkeys before selling the meat on for almost \u00a31m profit. Ray of light for rundown seaside towns The prime minister was pressed by Labour's Chris Ruane to appoint a minister responsible for seaside town centre regeneration. Mr Ruane also urged ring-fenced funding for seaside regeneration similar to that given to coal, steel, inner city and rural communities. Mr Blair said many seaside towns with \"real pockets of deprivation and poverty\" were becoming eligible for assistance for the first time. PM dodges question on national insurance increases A call by the Conservative MP, David Ruffley to rule out further national insurance increases was sidestepped by the prime minister who insisted April's 1% rise was the \"right decision\" and challenged Tories to explain how they would fund extra national health service investment. Councils keep control over right-to-buy funds The government was defeated over planned changes in handling receipts from councils' right-to-buy sales. Voting was 133 to 118 during the local government bill's third reading debate preventing ministers distributing cash to authorities with smaller sums to spend on building new homes. Lady Hanham (Conservative) said some councils had sold many properties and cash raised had been used to cut debt. It was unfair these should now have the money taken away and given to authorities that had not reduced their debts so well. But the Deputy Prime Minister's Office minister, Lord Rooker, said: \"It is right that the resources generated by the sale of council housing stock should be recycled and made available to the areas of greatest need.\" Assembly unmoved by calls for elections The Northern Ireland secretary, Paul Murphy, was urged to set a date for elections in the province because further postponement would be \"cancellation\". Mr Murphy insisted the government was keen to see the assembly elections take place before the end of the year. Drug money frozen The assets recovery agency in Northern Ireland has seized \u00a31.5 million of assets allegedly raised from drug dealing, revealed the Northern Ireland minister, Jane Kennedy. She said that on Monday the agency, set up in February to crack down on the crime that funds paramilitary groups, was granted a freezing order on the assets. Pensioners are being 'cheated' The government is cheating the elderly through tax rises, inadequate pensions and forcing them to pay for their care, claimed Liberal Democrat MP Paul Burstow. He said: \"Their message and our message today is that older people feel cheated by this government: cheated out of their life savings to pay for their care, cheated out of a decent pension and cheated out of a reasonable standard of living by an unfair and ever rising council tax.\" The pensions minister, Malcolm Wicks, said the rising age of the population would have \"major implications\" for pensions. \"This is not just about today's pensioners but about tomorrow's pensioners.\" The government was providing foundations of support for all pensioners but was targeting the poorest in particular who were approximately \u00a31,600 year better off under Labour. Gangmasters must stop exploitation Exploitation of vulnerable workers by gangmasters must stop, said Conservative MP Mark Simmonds. He warned obtaining casual work was marred by illegal migration, exploitation and violence. Introducing his licensing and registration of gangmasters bill, Mr Simmonds said he sought to make the role more legitimate. It gained a formal first reading but stands no chance of becoming law. Diplomatic destitutes Diplomatic missions in the UK owe more than \u00a3120,000 in unpaid parking and traffic fines, the foreign office disclosed. The United Arab Emirates tops the table of foreign states failing to pay fines, with 323 outstanding fines totalling \u00a312,830, according to the latest figures. In parliament today The education secretary, Charles Clarke, and his ministers and the solicitor general, Harriet Harman, face the commons at question time. The defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, opens a debate on defence in the UK. The Lords consider the anti-social behaviour bill's committee stage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
