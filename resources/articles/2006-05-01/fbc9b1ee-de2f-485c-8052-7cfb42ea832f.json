So while Charles Clarke and John Prescott may have been hauled over the coals in the UK, thousands of miles away, one paunchy South American counterpart seems to have invented a novel way to respond to press criticism: by starving himself in front of the cameras. In his many years in politics, presidential hopeful Anthony Garotinho has never been a dull character. Reborn as an evangelical Christian following a car crash in 1994, his CV lists jobs as diverse as football commentator, governor of Rio de Janeiro, and security minister. More recently he took on the guise of an evangelical daytime TV presenter, offering friendly lunchtime tips on how to achieve harmonious family life to Brazil's impoverished, television-obsessed masses. His latest reincarnation, however, looks set to overshadow them all. Flanked by his wife, Rosinha Garotinho - now herself the governor of Rio - and their nine children, he has embarked on a crusade against the Brazilian media that, he says, can have only two outcomes. Either the country's press allows him space to defend himself from a relentless string of corruption allegations - designed, he insists, to weaken his chances of being elected president - or he will die. In between times, he is willing to grant interviews. Nestled in an armchair opposite the cream-coloured sofa bed that has become his centre of operations, he says: \"[I'm] 48 hours already without eating and you get a little debilitated. But I'm still lucid.\" Even when surrounded by a sea of aides in his sparsely decorated campaign HQ, Garotinho cuts a lonely figure. He rocks back and forwards in his chair and, with only a small bottle of mineral water to occupy his hands, clutches them tightly between his legs. Yet he talks about his hunger strike with all the naturalness of a schoolboy explaining why poisoning the class hamster was a protest against a lack of vegetarian options in the canteen. \"[They are pursuing me] because of the programme that we are presenting ... which is a programme ... against the capitalist system that today has made Brazil the victim of high interest rates, low levels of growth and of a brutal and unequal wealth concentration,\" he says breathlessly. On which note, one disbelieving Canadian journalist inquires, \"Yes, but who is pursuing you, Mr Garotinho?\" \"The financial system,\" is his reply. As was perhaps intended, Garotinho's hunger strike has captured the headlines in Brazil. Since the strike began, his musty office in central Rio has been occupied by journalists and photographers who hover around the clock, jumping to attention each time the politician dims the lights or curls up for a nap. Outside in the smoke-filled corridor, well-wishers and political aides mill around eagerly, awaiting updates on his weight and blood pressure (provided daily in digestible, one-page Microsoft Word documents). Barring the Garotinho loyalists, however, sympathy for the man now known as \"Coronel Bolinha\" (or Colonel Podgie) has been in short supply. Few actually believe Garotinho will push himself to what he is calling the \"final consequences\", while the Brazilian press has written him off as a \"clown\", a \"marketer\" or, perhaps worse, a failing politician doing a bad impression of \"a crucified Jesus Christ\". Least taken of all was one visiting Dutch journalist. \"Don't you feel a bit exposed here?\" she wondered, incredulous. \"Isn't it a bit exhibitionist?\" \"No,\" replied Garotinho in characteristic fashion. \"I am complying with international hunger strike rules\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
