In one, a man discovers a monstrous woman covered with hair, marries her to exploit her at a funfair, falls in love with her and, after her death, travels with her embalmed body. In the other, four middle-aged men, bored with life, meet in a secluded villa in order to literally eat themselves to death. Both these films, The Ape Woman (1964) and La Grande Bouffe (1973), were directed by the Italian Marco Ferreri and, for almost 30 years, from 1959 to 1988, the pair worked together on 17 Spanish, Italian and French films, all of them heartless black comedies with a surreal sensitivity. Azcona, who belonged to the Spanish surrealist tradition of Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Luis Bu\u00f1uel, Rafael Alberti, Luis Cernuda and Joan Mir\u00f3, agreed with Dal\u00ed, who declared: \"I come from Spain, which is the most irrational and most mystical country in the world.\" The son of a tailor, Azcona was born in Logro\u00f1o, the capital of the Rioja region of north-east Spain. Like Bu\u00f1uel, he was antipathetic towards the Catholic church, mainly because of his education by monks. \"I remember endless masses, rosaries and being made to feel submissive and miserable,\" he recalled. \"By 14, I had lost any sense of sin.\" In 1951, Azcona moved to Madrid where he joined the legendary satirical magazine El Cordoniz, which got him accustomed to finding ways of getting around the censor. At the same time, he wrote several short novels, among them Los Muertos No Se Tocan, Nene (You Can't Touch the Dead, Kid), which brought about his meeting with Ferreri. As a production assistant in Italian films in Madrid, Ferreri approached Azcona with an offer to film the 1956 novel. However, when no financing was forthcoming, Azcona, who claimed not to have any knowledge of films, suggested that Ferreri become a director and leave others to find the money. Thus he made his directorial debut with El Pisito (The Little Flat, 1958), adapted by Azcona from his own novel. This anti-bourgeois black comedy centres on a middle-class man who marries a crotchety, dying octogenarian in order to inherit her apartment so he can marry his fiancee. This was followed by El Cochecito (The Wheelchair, 1959), also based on one of Azcona's novels, a sardonic study of geriatric revolt, in which an elderly but fit man becomes obsessed by the desire to own a motorised wheelchair like those of his disabled friends. Both films were oblique critiques of Franco's regime, but totalitarian Spain was no place for such anarchic flights of fancy, so Ferreri returned to Italy. However, Azcona continued to answer his call, and among the Italian-French co-productions they made together was The Conjugal Bed (1963), in which a middle-aged car dealer (Ugo Tognazzi) marries a young woman who desperately wants a baby. Her voracious sexual appetite wearies him until he suffers a fatal heart attack after his final - and successful - attempt to make her pregnant. Characteristic of Italian sex comedies that were all the rage in the 1960s, the film had the added Spanish surreal twist. Other films written by Azcona and directed by Ferreri included The Ape Woman; The Audience (1971), a Kafkaesque anti-clerical tale in which a young provincial's attempts to meet the Pope are consistently frustrated by Vatican officialdom; and La Grande Bouffe, an excessive movie of excess, which caused a nationwide scandal, but went on to have a huge box-office success. Another succ\u00e9s de scandale was The Last Woman (1976), which told of the wife of a young French engineer who walks out on her husband (G\u00e9rard Depardieu) and their baby to join a friend in the feminist movement. In the end, he castrates himself with an electric carving knife. The scenes of a phallocrat unable to deal with women asserting themselves are amusing, but the symbolism of the ending indicated to many that Ferreri did not know how far to go too far. Back in Spain, Azcona's black humour and director Luis Garc\u00eda Berlanga's taste for savage satire combined to produce several classics of Spanish cinema, coating political barbs with a patina of comedy. Placido (1961), in which the middle-classes are urged one Christmas to \"Seat a Poor Man at Your Table\", offered a mocking portrait of offialdom and Christian charity. El Verdugo (The Executioner, 1962), tells of a young man who, having married the daughter of the local executioner, becomes his father-in-law's successor in the job, never thinking that he would have to kill anyone. Despite cuts by Franco's censor, the film is not only a condemnation of capital punishment but contains social criticism spiked with gallows humour. Typical is the scene where the tyro executioner is reluctantly dragged along to perform his macabre duty on a calm and dignified political prisoner. Life Size (1973) tells of a successful Parisian dentist (Michel Piccoli) who acquires a life-sized doll, causing him to abandon his practice and his wife to devote himself exclusively to life with the doll. This bizarre portrait of fetishism is made even more effective by the fact that it is rooted in a realistic context. Azcona's screenplays for Carlos Saura began with Peppermint Frapp\u00e9 (1968), which tells of a doctor becoming obsessively infatuated with his brother's attractive wife, with tragic consequences, and ended six films later with Ay Carmela (1990), set during the Spanish civil war. Although Azcona was now free to take sly and witty digs at fascism and military bureaucracy, Franco's death had deprived both him and Saura of an element of danger. Ay Carmela gained Azcona a Goya award (he won five in his career) as did his script for Fernando Trueba's Belle \u00c9poque (1992), which went on to win an Oscar for best foreign-language film. The charming tale, set in 1931 at the dawn of the short-lived Spanish Republic, focused on the romantic involvement of a young army deserter with the four sexy daughters of a farmer. The Butterfly Tongue (1999), set in much the same period and adapted from a collection of stories by Manuel Rivas, was a tender coming-of-age story that gradually develops into a study of the destruction of innocence. Despite illness, Azcona continued to work until the end, writing his final screenplay for the soon-to-be-released Los Girasoles Ciegos, a post-civil war tragedy. He is survived by his wife and two sons. \u00b7 Rafael Azcona Fern\u00e1ndez, screenwriter, novelist, born October 24 1926; died March 24 2008"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
