Fela Kuiti's oldest son is now in his 50s, and surely knows that he will never achieve the legendary status of his dad, but continues to fight the same causes. And he's still worth checking out, though more for the musical experiment than the admirable, though now predictable, message, which veers towards easy sloganeering at times. The starting point is Afrobeat, of course, but Femi is at his best developing his own slick, melodic style, using a light guitar riff for the opening of The World Is Changing, or showing off his fine, high vocals on No Work No Job No Money."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
