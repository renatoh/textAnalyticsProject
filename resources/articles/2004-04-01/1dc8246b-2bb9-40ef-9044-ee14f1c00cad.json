His doctors said in a statement that Maradona's \"progress has been satisfactory until now\" and that his arterial pressure was normalising. According to Argentinian TV channel Todo Noticas, the 43-year-old fell ill after an overdose. However Maradona's doctor Alfredo Cahe denied the reports, adding that he had noticed nothing unusual about the former Napoli star's health during his daily check-up. \"It is not related to an overdose,\" Cahe said. \"Lately Maradona was not (consuming) cocaine. He has a lung infection ... because of a chill. He is quite stable and his progress is relatively good.\" Earlier, the player's former wife, Claudia Villafane, visited him together with their two children, as did former Argentina coach Carlos Bilardo, his friend and former agent Guillermo Coppola and ex-Argentina international Hector Enrique. \"We expect him to heal as soon as possible,\" said Cristiana Sinagra, the mother of Maradona's son Diego Armando junior, speaking in Italy. \"It's a tough moment but we're confident that he will he get better.\" But another former player, Claudio Garcia, was less optimistic, saying: \"The situation is more severe than four years ago.\" In 2000 Maradona suffered a severe heart attack. He was taken to a hospital in critical condition and then went through a long period of recovery treatment in Cuba. The Argentinian legend, who had to be heavily sedated before being hooked up to a respirator, has long been in therapy to battle drug addiction. Twice banned for failing drug tests during his playing days, Maradona received a 15-month suspension in 1991 after testing positive for cocaine while playing in Italy's Serie A, and was sent home from the 1994 World Cup and banned for a further 15-month period. Best known in Britain for the infamous \"Hand of God\" incident during England's 2-1 World Cup quarter-final loss against Argentina on June 22 1986, which saw the man many believe to be the greatest footballer of all time punch the ball over England goalkeeper Peter Shilton. Despite the evidence of television replays, Maradona never admitted it was a handball, famously insisting that the \"Hand of God\" had guided the ball into the net, although no such divine intervention was needed for his second goal; his mazey run from the half-way line him mesmerising the England defence. He went on to lead Argentina to victory over West Germany in the World Cup final that summer, and also helped them reach the 1990 final. Family, friends and well-wishers rushed to the Suizo-Argentina clinic on as news of the 43-year-old's illness spread. One teary-eyed fan carried a photograph of Maradona in his footballing heyday.
