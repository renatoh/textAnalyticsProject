Johnny Murtagh replaces the Frenchman on the Pascal Bary-trained filly in the Entenmann's-sponsored race at the Curragh. \"The filly is very well and she runs on Sunday. Johnny Murtagh is riding the filly - an Irishman in Ireland,\" said Alan Cooper, racing manager to owners, the Niarchos family. \"I've no comment to make about anything being expressed about Monsieur Thulliez,\" he added. Six Perfections started a hot favourite for the fillies' Classic at Newmarket earlier this month in the hands of Thulliez but was beaten a length and a half by Russian Rhythm. Drawn on the stands' rail in stall one, Six Perfections was at the rear of the field with just over two furlongs to go and was forced wide following scrimmaging. She made up a lot of ground when switched to the outside, but could not reach the winner. Thulliez has ridden Six Perfections in all her six races so far, winning four times."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
