It curiously coincided with the return of Simon King, the defender who was their player of the season as they reached the play-offs in 2008-09 but injured an ankle and has been absent for almost as long as Gillingham's on-the-road misfortunes \u2013 his last first-team appearance came in May 2009, just a couple of weeks after that previous away win. \u2022 Leaders played strugglers in three divisions, with a variety of results. In League One Brighton failed to beat Bristol Rovers in a game that featured two own goals and a penalty \u2013 scored by Chris Wood, making his debut on loan from West Brom against the club who were desperate to sign him themselves earlier this year. In the Blue Square Bet Premier Crawley moved top after thrashing bottom-placed Altrincham 7-0 at home, the visitors' misfortune so complete that they also contrived to miss a penalty. \u2022 The other notable top v bottom encounter was in the Championship, where QPR took advantage of Cardiff's defeat to Nottingham Forest, returning to the top of the table with victory over Preston. The visitors, with one win in nine now, gifted Rob Hulse the first after a bit of a howler from their goalkeeper, Andy Lonergan, and it went downhill from there. Adel Taarabt scored another brace \u2013 had he got the divisional player of the season award wrapped up already, or is Kris Commons (or somebody else) still in with a shout? \u2022 A statistical milestone worth noting: in the Welsh Premier, Bangor City have won their first 13 league games of the season, equalling the British record set by Reading in 1985-86."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
