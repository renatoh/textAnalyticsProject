Failing to heed their warnings, my husband and I drove with our six-month-old twins first to visit friends in Belgium, then onwards to stay with my sister-in-law in Germany, before finally arriving as juddering wrecks at an apartment in a converted grain mill in the Languedoc region of France. We were greeted by the mill's owner, a flamboyant and blind-drunk Londoner who sloshed wine into our glasses from the kind of plastic container you usually associate with car oil. As our first evening wore on, the owner - for some unfathomable reason - started referring to me as 'Slapper', as in, 'More wine, Slapper?' or, 'Fancy something to eat, Slapper?' Unfortunately, the 'charming courtyard restaurant' described in the brochure didn't exist. There was, however, a chaotic kitchen populated by meandering cats and dogs and a vast chest freezer which emitted a foul stench of rotting vegetation whenever its lid was lifted. The owner hauled out chicken portions, ripped them apart with filthy hands and slapped them onto the barbecue in the garden. As we feasted on raw poultry, we were joined by the owner's mother who was sporting an enormous scab on her forehead. 'Mum walked into a pillar,' the owner explained. 'She'd had rather a lot of gin.' At least it wasn't dull. We played in the pool, watching with interest as the owner brought a device to check the water's chemical levels, peered at its gauge and hurried away, cursing to himself. His sister showed up in jeans and a grubby white bra, and gaily sliced through trees with a chainsaw. We sat up late with guests from the other apartments, learning that this had once been a thriving apartment complex until the authorities had shut it down. Perhaps this explained why we had been told to send our money to a mysterious Irish bank account. Our twins were sleeping terribly in the dank apartment, and spirits were sagging. Exhausted, my husband drove to the nearest town for nappies. He was gone for hours. I seethed - until I received a call saying he had been in a car crash and was at the police station. He was unharmed; our new Espace was a write-off. Released without charge, my husband was driven at 95mph by a crazed cab driver to Toulouse airport to collect the replacement car provided by our insurance company. Shattered and depressed, we drove back to London in a hire car. Our house was in sight when my husband clipped a litter bin, scraping the passenger door and racking up an additional \u00a3300 charge. As we staggered into our house, I recalled the owner's jovial cry as we pulled away from his car park: 'See you next summer, Slapper!' \u00b7 Have you had a crap holiday? Please tell us about it.
