But it was just five years ago that the 18-year-old had only ever had home schooling. At the time that was her only option, as conflict raged outside near the contentious border between Pakistan and Afghanistan where she lived. Since then Muhibzada has transitioned from a young refugee waiting to travel to the US to a college-bound teenager at a high school in Cleveland, Ohio. Helping her on that journey has been a not-for-profit, Refugee Response, which creates programs to address the needs of the 2,500 refugees who have settled in the city since 2008, and is one of 25 organizations the Guardian is highlighting in its City Champions project. Nationally, Donald Trump\u2019s administration has cut the refugee program to admit the fewest number of people in its nearly 40-year history, with a ceiling of 18,000 people announced for the coming year. Refugee officers, resettlement groups and advocates say the government has effectively stopped the program and, in October, not a single refugee was resettled in the US. But, while the administration\u2019s drastic cuts to the refugee program have caused dozens of resettlement offices to close down, because Refugee Response is not directly tied to the government\u2019s resettlement program, it has doubled in size in the past two years. \u201cI think it\u2019s a testament to the work our teams do and the need for it in the community,\u201d said Patrick Kearns, Refugee Response\u2019s executive director. Cleveland has historically welcomed refugees and as the federal government has shrunk the resettlement program, the mayor, Frank Jackson, has repeatedly affirmed the city\u2019s support for these immigrants. \u201cCleveland is a city that is open and welcoming to all people and families, no matter from how near or far they come,\u201d Jackson said last year. \u201cIt is important, now more than ever, that we stand in solidarity with those who come to Cleveland seeking a better life in our city as refugees.\u201d Refugee Response\u2019s services include in-home tutoring, work on one of the largest urban farms in the country and a program for high school students such as Muhibzada. \u201cWe\u2019re all about not just providing one-time aid, or a one-time donation or a gift, but seeing through on a path that is going to be transformative,\u201d Kearns said. The program Muhibzada is in, Teen Response, came about to address the gap in what a school system can provide to refugee students who may have been exposed to unique traumatic situations, inconsistent education and other obstacles specific to people fleeing conflict zones. In addition to providing tutoring, career counseling and cultural education, Muhibzada said Teen Response creates a built-in social support group with people from all over the world. \u201cWe\u2019ve become like a family,\u201d she said. Teen Response, intentionally, also benefits Muhibzada\u2019s family. While her father, who supported the US armed forces in Afghanistan, is fluent in English, Muhibzada is able to share what she learns in English tutoring and career counseling with the rest of her family. \u201cI teach my sisters what this means, what I learned and you have to know this is important,\u201d Muhibzada said. And for her specifically, Teen Response has helped her manage a busy schedule which in the past year has included organizing logistics for the school\u2019s US military student training program, JROTC; being treasurer for her class; participating in the Upward Bound college preparation program; taking college-level courses at a nearby university; and interning at a retirement home. \u201cEven if I need help in my classes, I come here and finish it,\u201d Muhibzada said. \u201cWhen I go home, I relax and go to sleep,\u201d Feeling violence in the Congo Refugee flows follow international crises \u2013 while many refugees in the past decade have been from the Middle East, in recent years, there has been an increase in people arriving from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Each population has different needs, and Refugee Response is built to respond to the shifting nature of these populations. When there was an increase in Afghan families arriving in Cleveland, Refugee Response surveyed the new arrivals and identified a gap in educational opportunities for adult women. \u201cWe saw that particular population was becoming very socially isolated, left at home with young kids and no real outlet or access to understanding the new society or new world they are in,\u201d Kearns said.
