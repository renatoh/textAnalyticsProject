His attorney, Brian Heberlig, disclosed plans to put Mr Ebbers on the stand during a hearing with prosecutors and the judge in the case, which relates to an $11bn (\u00a35.7bn) accounting scandal at the telecommunications company. Mr Ebbers, 63, is charged with fraud, conspiracy and filing false documents with regulators. He faces up to 85 years in prison if convicted on all counts.
