Worst-hit are lobster and crab fishermen in Scotland\u2019s south-east and west coasts, according to the Fishermen\u2019s Mission, a Christian welfare charity. Staff at the charity have also identified \u201cpockets of need\u201d in Shetland and as far south as Newlyn in Cornwall. This comes just before the Easter holiday, traditionally a period of increased demand. Claire McIntosh, the Mission\u2019s area official for south-east Scotland, has been working 12-hour days fielding calls from crews whose skippers have had to tie up their boats. \u201cI\u2019ve been liaising with food banks since January,\u201d said McIntosh, whose patch covers the 80 miles of coastline from Seahouses in Northumberland to Port Seton in East Lothian. \u201cThis is on the back of poor weather and poor catches during winter. They are very self-sufficient folk, very resilient, resourceful and hard-working. Their last resort is to come to us. But I\u2019ve handed out \u00a317,500 in the last few weeks, compared to \u00a312,000 for the whole of the last year.\u201d The UK fishing industry is worth \u00a3989m annually, with Scottish vessels responsible for more than half, at \u00a3574m in 2018. More than 70% of its catch is exported, mainly to Europe and Asia, but foreign and hospitality markets have collapsed in the crisis. While a much smaller retail market still exists for some fish, many supermarkets have shut their fish counters, reducing demand further. For high-value shellfish, the market is now virtually nonexistent. \u201cLangoustine, shrimp and prawn are almost impossible to get rid of and the demand for crab and lobster in China has just vaporised,\u201d said David Dickens, the Mission\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a pandemic, people aren\u2019t interested in high quality seafood.\u201d The charity\u2019s 71 staff across the UK are expecting things to get worse. \u201cAll the indications are we\u2019re at the beginning of a curve of need,\u201d said Dickens. \u201cThis is the calm before the storm. From Kirkcudbright in the south up as far as Mallaig, there\u2019s a lot of very worried people. We\u2019re planning for the worst, but hoping for the best. Our focus is keeping the lights on and keeping food on the table.\u201d On 25 March, the Scottish government announced a \u00a35m assistance package aimed at 650 seafood companies impacted by the collapse in the market for shellfish, and for owners of full-time registered vessels under 12 metres. Dickens welcomes the scheme, which is underway, but said he and his staff are supporting crew or skippers who are ineligible, including those working part time. A further \u00a310m package for fish processing businesses was announced by the Scottish government on 3 April. A spokesperson said: \u201cWork on the grant to processors is ongoing and we hope to open applications soon.\u201d They added that further support is being made available, including a \u00a32.2bn grant to help Scottish businesses pay staff and treat them fairly. Donna Fordyce, the interim head of trade marketing body Seafood Scotland, which is working on exploring other alternatives to get Scotland\u2019s seafood to consumers, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty grim picture across the board. The seafood sector has been one of the hardest hit of all the sectors in Scotland, because of the level of exports. The market has more or less collapsed in Europe.\u201d It was already a bad year for fishermen, she said, with the \u201cworst weather we\u2019ve seen for 15 years for fleets\u201d, before the Covid-19 crisis hit. \u201cThe prawn and the scallop fleet are more or less all tied up,\u201d said Fordyce. \u201cThe whitefish fleet, some are still going out. \u201cIt is going to be a UK market for the next few months.\u201d Scotland has 2,089 registered vessels and 4,860 crew. Among those waiting to find out if they are eligible for the \u00a310m fund for processors is Jamie McMillan, the managing director of Loch Fyne Langoustines and Loch Fyne Seafarms. McMillan, who employs 22 staff directly and a further 48 on vessels, was forced to close temporarily three weeks ago because of the pandemic. \u201cWe are waiting with bated breath,\u201d said McMillan, who processes and exports scallops, lobsters and crabs. \u201cIf we can\u2019t get that or we are not eligible, we\u2019re finished.\u201d McMillan is currently paying his staff 80% of their salary, under the coronavirus retention scheme, which he can claim back from the government. But he lost 44% of sales to Hong Kong and China when Covid-19 first hit there, and has been losing money since January. \u201cWe are having to pay staff weekly. It\u2019s a huge strain on the business as we haven\u2019t any cash.\u201d Based in Tarbert, Argyll and Bute, which has a population of 1,500, McMillan is one of the village\u2019s largest employers. \u201cTwenty-two jobs is a lot of families,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cThe whole fishing industry is going to look different when we come out of this. Our customers in Hong Kong are saying 50% of their restaurants have not survived.\u201d Selling direct to the public, a tactic used by some shellfish fishermen in Devon and Cornwall, is more challenging in remote communities in Scotland, he said. \u201cEveryone is trying to sell to the general public but for us it\u2019s very precarious. Businesses like ours depend on volume. I see people in Cornwall doing that. But when you live remotely as we do, there is just not the demand.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
