It wants to be a nimble-footed con movie, but also a bludgeoning (and bloody) revenge thriller, neither of which it succeeds in. Samuel L Jackson leads the line as a recently released grifter trying to go straight, but who is sucked back in by the son of his former partner looking for vengeance for his dad's death. Tom Wilkinson stands out as a very camp, wine-quaffing uber-villain; but it's the bewildering switches of tone that scupper Fury. At one moment Jackson is leading his \"team\" through an elaborate swindle, the next he's stabbing someone in the neck with a razor blade. It just doesn't add up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
