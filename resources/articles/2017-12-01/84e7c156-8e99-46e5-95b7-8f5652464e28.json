Jones gave Democrats a much-needed adrenaline shot by beating Moore, the evangelical former state judge whose campaign was marred by multiple accusations of sexual assault and child molestation. And the morning after, Democrats immediately seized upon the remarkable win, which cuts Republican majority in the Senate to one, as a sign of more victories to come in 2018. \u201cAlabama\u2019s not an outlier \u2013 it\u2019s a trend,\u201d Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said on a conference call on Wednesday. Tuesday\u2019s results put the House and the Senate majorities in play next year, Perez said, setting an ambitious goal ahead for an election year focused on the November midterms. Democrats have a plausible path to a House majority in 2018, but the midterm map was widely expected to favor Republicans in the Senate. Democrats must defend 10 seats in states where Trump won while, until Alabama shifted the ground, only two Republican seats were seen as vulnerable. Perez said Democrats have a real shot at winning Senate seats in Arizona and Tennessee, where the Republican senators are retiring after clashes with Trump, as well as in Nevada, where the Republican senator is being challenged from the right by a candidate aligned closely with the president. \u201cThe field is very wide open,\u201d Perez said. \u201cI think we will win the House of Representatives, I think we will win the US Senate.\u201d Yet the circumstances of the race for the Alabama seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, who is now the attorney general, were unique. Moore, who late on Tuesday was refusing to concede the race, had been favored in the state until two women came forward to claim that he assaulted them when they were teenagers; a number of other women said the Alabama Republican had romantically pursued them when they were underage. Moore has denied all the allegations. On Tuesday night, Jones emerged to a euphoric reception just before 10pm local time. \u201cFolks, I gotta tell you, I think that I have been waiting all my life and now I just don\u2019t know what the hell to say,\u201d he said, beginning a 10-minute speech. \u201cI have always believed that the people of Alabama had more in common than what would divide us.\u201d On Wednesday, at a relaxed post-election press conference, Jones brushed off Moore\u2019s refusal to concede. He noted that he had a congratulatory call from Trump and said \u201cwhen the president of United States who endorsed Roy Moore calls me and congratulates me I think it\u2019s pretty clean cut\u201d. Jones said Trump had also invited him to visit the White House once he arrived in Washington and that he had also heard from both Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell as well as both of the Yellowhammer State\u2019s current senators. Senate majority cut Republican control of the Senate now rests precariously on the narrowest 51 to 49 seat margin. Jones struck a far more cautious note than many of his future colleagues who have demanded that he be seated right away in order to vote on the tax cut bill currently before Congress. The senator-elect didn\u2019t take a position on the urgency of taking his seat in the Senate. \u201cWe\u2019ll see the way it goes and I\u2019ll go with it either way,\u201d said Jones. On Capitol Hill, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader, said 2018 is \u201clooking good for us\u201d. \u201cThe Republican brand, even in deep-red Alabama, is positively toxic,\u201d he told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cIf they continue to run the government for the benefit of the few special, powerful, wealthy interests, there will be many more Alabamas in 2018, many more,\u201d he added. Schumer said the turn-out in Alabama followed a similar pattern as elections earlier this year in Virginia and New Jersey: an energized Democratic base; strong turnout by African American voters; decisive support from millennials; and significant gains among suburban white voters \u2013 an especially ominous sign for Republicans who are contemplating elections in affluent districts with highly-educated and high-income voters. \u201cThe suburbs are swinging back to us,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cRepublicans, with their policies, are going to lose them in 2018. And now they\u2019re even making it worse with their tax bill, which is an anti-suburban tax bill.\u201d In the short-term, Democrats are mounting an unlikely effort to persuade the Republican Senate leadership to postpone the vote on their tax plan until after Jones is seated as a senator in the New Year. But a senior Republican aide said there was no intention of changing the timeline of the tax vote \u2013 the party hopes to have a bill on Trump\u2019s desk next week. Jones\u2019 victory is also a major political setback for Trump, who vigorously endorsed the Alabama Republican despite the sex allegations against him and held a rally on his behalf last week, just over the state line in Pensacola, Florida. Although most national Republican figures rushed to distance themselves from Moore in the aftermath of the allegations that he targeted teenage girls while he was in his 30s, Trump reaffirmed his support through tweets and public statements. On Wednesday, Trump, who rarely concedes defeat or accepts responsibility, claimed that he had known all along that Moore was unelectable, which, he said, was why he initially endorsed his opponent, Luther Strange, during Alabama\u2019s summer Republican primary. \u201cIf last night\u2019s election proved anything, it proved that we need to put up GREAT Republican candidates to increase the razor thin margins in both the House and Senate,\u201d he said. However, as the soul-searching begins, Republican establishment figures like Senate leader Mitch McConnell are braced for an even uglier civil war with the populist faction whipped up by Trump\u2019s former White House adviser Steve Bannon. Bannon blames entrenched Washington politicians for abandoning Moore and the interests of deeply conservative grassroots voters, while more moderate conservatives see his aggressive bid to takeover the party with firebrand candidates as a disaster for their image. Earlier this year, Bannon declared a \u201cseason of war\u201d on the so-called GOP establishment and has vowed to recruit and field candidates against Republican incumbents in 2018. But some Republicans are hopeful the sting of defeat will deflate Bannon\u2019s confidence \u2013 and weaken his influence with the president. \u201cI don\u2019t think Steve Bannon adds anything positive at all to the dialogue in the country,\u201d New York congressman Pete King, a Republican, said on MSNBC, after calling on his party to \u201cdump Bannon\u201d the night before. In his floor remarks, McConnell did not mention the Alabama election results in his before succumbing to a coughing fit. He was granted permission to submit the rest of his remarks for the public record and left the floor. \u201cStrange to say I guess from my side of the aisle, but I thought it was a great night for America, so I couldn\u2019t be more happy,\u201d Senator Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee who is retiring at the end of his term, told reporters on Capitol Hill. Yet Republicans downplayed the significance of the result, insisting that it did not signal a Democratic wave in 2018. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a rebuke of conservative values or agendas,\u201d Republican senator Cory Gardner, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told reporters. \u201cThis was a rebuke of a candidate.\u201d Ben Jacobs contributed reporting from Birmingham, Alabama."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
