The report comes as the Taiwanese government seeks to hose down reports that it is concerned at the prospect of Joe Biden becoming the next US president and taking a more conciliatory approach to China than Donald Trump. The People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) has ratcheted up military activity in and around the Taiwan Strait this year, amid increasing hostilities with Taiwan and the US. Beijing considers Taiwan to be a wayward province and has not ruled out taking it by force. Citing a local monitoring group, Taiwan\u2019s Liberty Times said the PLA had invaded Taiwan\u2019s air identification zone on at least 25 days last month. Taiwan is building up its defence capabilities to discourage any possible cross-strait conflict, and has spent more than $1bn this year in scrambling jets to respond to the sorties towards and over the so-called \u201cmedian line\u201d in the Strait. But analysts say the prospect of defending itself against an invasion would rely on outside assistance. While the US has a longstanding policy of refusing to says if it would come to Taiwan\u2019s aid in the instance of an attack \u2013 in order to deter both sides \u2013 it has increased its military activity in the region and its arms sales to Taiwan under Trump, amid a broader push back against Chinese dominance in the region. Taiwan\u2019s government has been forced to reject media reports by the Washington Post that some within the government feared a Biden-led administration would be less supportive of Taiwan. Taiwan\u2019s representative to the US, Hsiao Bi-khim, said on Sunday the government did not take positions on US elections. \u201cSince arriving in Washington, I have reached out to new friends and old friends in both parties, and I appreciate the bipartisan support and friendship for Taiwan,\u201d she said. The US stance against Chinese aggression has won Trump support among the Taiwanese public, where a recent YouGov poll found 45% of respondents thought his actions had had a positive impact on their region, while a third thought the impact had been negative. It found Trump was supported by 42% of Taiwanese people compared with Biden\u2019s 30%, the only Asian population polled that supported Trump over Biden. The US considers Taiwan an important barrier to China\u2019s control in the Indo-Pacific and has increased diplomatic and other support this year, despite not having formal ties. The former US defence official Randall Schriver last month described the island as a \u201cmodern-day Asia Fulda Gap\u201d, referring to the region between East and West Germany that was considered the most likely place for a US-Soviet Union Cold War clash. PJ Crowley, the former assistant secretary of state for public affairs under Barrack Obama, told the Guardian the deterioration of US-China relations was \u201carguably the most consequential development\u201d in geopolitics during Trump\u2019s term. \u201cRegardless of who is president come January, there will be an assessment of what has occurred in Hong Kong and what it means for Taiwan,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cIf Vice President Biden wins, he will need to make clear to [China\u2019s president] Xi [Jinping] hat he will become more active with respect to Hong Kong and Taiwan \u2026 Maintaining the high-level dialogue with Taipei would be one way to demonstrate that what happens there remains important to the United States.\u201d Additional reporting by Lillian Yang"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
