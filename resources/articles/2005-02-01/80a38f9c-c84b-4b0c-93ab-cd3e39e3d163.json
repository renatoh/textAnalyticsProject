Neilson has added an extra weekly flight to Lyon to meet demand for late-season skiing from March 26. The last departure date will be on April 9, a week later than originally planned. Prices for the final week are from \u00a3385pp, down from \u00a3665pp the week before, for seven nights at Chalet Ushuaia in Tignes, including flights, transfers and half-board chalet accommodation. Rival operator Thomson has already extended its season, offering departures to Tignes until April 24, two weeks later than usual. It also offered its earliest ever departures in its 2004/05 brochure and plans to do the same next season. Its first departure in winter 2005 will be October 22. \u00b7 Hundreds of holidaymakers due to fly out to Andorra tomorrow, are being advised by travel companies to turn up at the airport as normal despite recent freak weather conditions in the Pyrenees. A Thomson spokeswoman said if conditions were still bad, transfer coaches would take an alternative route, adding an hour to the four-hour journey."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
