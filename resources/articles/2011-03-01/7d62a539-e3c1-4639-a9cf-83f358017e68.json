After all, the long-overdue firing of commentator Juan Williams was thoroughly botched on her watch, giving Williams the opportunity to reinvent himself as a hero of the right. Following that fiasco, one of Schiller's underlings, Ellen Weiss, was pushed out of her job. Then, when NPR chief fundraiser Ron Schiller (no relation) was caught on video by rightwing prankster James O'Keefe making some unseemly remarks about Tea Party Republicans, Vivian Schiller's first instinct was to humiliate her employee in public. Never mind that O'Keefe's record of selective editing and even lawbreaking should have led her to wait for all the facts to come in. Sadly, early indications are that Vivian Schiller's shortcomings as a people person have nothing to do with why her tenure at NPR has come to an end. Instead, it would appear that the NPR board has decided to offer her up as a sacrifice to the right, hoping desperately to stave off efforts by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives to cut off government funding. It's a strategy that's doomed to fail. Vivian Schiller told the Associated Press: \"I did not want to leave NPR. There's a lot of pressure on NPR right now. It would have made it too difficult for stations to face that funding threat in Congress without this change.\" Now, there's no question that Ron Schiller made something of a fool of himself in the company of two of O'Keefe's trolls. Posing as members of a non-existent Muslim group, they offered NPR $5m and engaged Schiller in a conversation about pro-Israel bias in the media, among other things. Schiller's response: The current Republican party is not really the Republican party. It's been hijacked by this group that is ... not just Islamophobic but, really, xenophobic. They believe in sort of white, middle America, gun-toting \u2013 it's scary. They're seriously racist, racist people.\" Oh, my. Talk about playing into every stereotype about NPR as a liberal, elitist organisation out of touch with ordinary Americans. Still, he refused the donation. And as an employee of the business side, he had no say over how NPR covered the news. As John Cook, writing at Gawker, put it, the video \"shockingly documents the fact that at least one NPR executive who has absolutely no news-gathering role is a mainline liberal and refuses to accept money from shadowy Muslim organisations.\" Yet Vivian Schiller, even after handing in her own resignation, continued to pile on, telling the New York Times that she \"obviously had no prior knowledge\" of Ron Schiller's comments \"and nothing to do with them, and disavowed them as soon as I learned of them all. But I'm the CEO, and the buck stops here.\" Yes, especially when your board members tell you to pack up and get out. What's absurd about all this is that, with more than 20 million weekly listeners, and millions more visitors online, NPR is one of our largest and most vital news organisations, towering over the rightwing noise machine that is now trying to bring it down. Yes, the Republican House could vote to defund public radio and public television. But the Democrats still control the Senate, and Barack Obama has included $451m for public broadcasting in his budget proposal. Tea Party threats are scary only to those who are easily scared. Earlier today, two rightwing Republican senators, Tom Coburn and Jim DeMint, filed a bill to defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the quasi-governmental agency that funnels public money to NPR and to public television. NPR is so successful at raising money from listeners and corporate underwriters that it could survive without government funding. (It would be tougher for television, with its far higher production costs.) Yet at a time when traditional business models for journalism are collapsing, it makes no sense to undermine one of the few models that is working. NPR offers fair, serious and \u2013 yes \u2013 unbiased reporting on national and international events of the sort that's available in only a handful of venues. Vivian Schiller arrived at NPR a little more than two years ago, and its success predates her by many years. Some give her high marks for improving the operation's internet side. \"She pushed them hard to be more digital, experimental and conversational,\" Dan Gillmor, the author of the new media-literacy book Mediactive, told me. But NPR has been a juggernaut for several decades now. It would be a tragedy if Schiller's departure foreshadows a full-fledged retreat. NPR's board demonstrated that it has not been paying any attention to the culture wars that are raging these days. If you make a blood sacrifice to the right, it just wants more. NPR should stand and fight. It might lose. The alternative, though, is to so compromise its standards and its mission that winning will look like losing. \u2022 Full disclosure note: Dan Kennedy is a paid commentator on public television station WGBH, Channel 2, in Boston, and an occasional unpaid guest on WGBH Radio (89.7FM)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
