A lot of ITV's most popular programmes are made in the north west.\" Bectu and the NUJ fear the move from Granada's 40-year-old Quay Street HQ to new offices and studio facilities nearby will be used as a cost-cutting exercise to reduce the company's head count. Union officials compared the move to that at Granada's Meridian subsidiary, which is expected to cut more than 100 jobs as part of a plan to move from Southampton to a new site in Fareham. \"We don't know the detail, but if Meridian is anything to go by, it's likely to be bad news,\" said a Bectu official. \"With the merger [between Carlton and Granada], we expect them to be looking for cost savings where ever they can, but we'll have to wait and see,.\" ITV programmes made in Manchester include Coronation Street, Stars in their Eyes, You've Been Framed and Tonight with Trevor McDonald. Second world war drama Island at War and Caroline Quentin police thriller Blue Murder are also being filmed in the city. Granada also has a documentary department in Manchester. Granada wants to close one of its four existing studios at the Quay Street site and build a new production stage, which it says will allow for more flexible working practices. However, Granada stressed the proposed changes in Manchester were a \u00a315m redevelopment of the company's existing base rather than a move to a completely new site. And the managing director of Granada north-west, Brenda Smith, defended the proposals, saying it would lead to a \"multimillion pound investment in the region\". \"As a company we're passionate about regional and network programme making and to keep pace with developments within the broadcasting industry it's vital we reinvest to sustain further growth for the city and the region,\" Ms Smith said. \"The reinvestment programme will ensure Granada in the north-west continues to contribute in a major way to network production for ITV and other major broadcasters,\" she added. Bectu and the NUJ are already planning a major campaign to protect the jobs of their members working for Carlton and Granada in the wake of the planned merger, which got the green light from competition regulators last month. Carlton and Granada have promised shareholders they will deliver savings of at least \u00a355m a year as part of the merger to form ITV plc and the unions fear that much of the cost-cutting could come from regional production centres. The ITV companies currently make network and regional programmes in cities including Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, Birmingham, Nottingham, Norwich, Bristol, Plymouth and Southampton. Plans have already been announced to move Carlton and Granada's combined London regional news operation in to ITN's building on Gray's Inn Road, with the loss of up to 40 jobs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
