The former Chelsea and QPR striker only turned professional six months ago and qualified for the \u00a3500,000 European Tour event on Tuesday. And the 37-year-old admitted the experience, and the surrounding media frenzy, had caught him completely by surprise. \"This is as big a shock to me as it is to most of you. I'm just very happy to be involved and see where it leads,\" he said after completing his first practice round at Houghton Golf Club and one of many interviews. \"At Luton we played in a League Cup final at Wembley (lost 3-1 to Nottingham Forest in 1989) but I don't think I was as nervous at Wembley as I was coming down the last two holes in the qualifier on Tuesday. I knew what I was doing at Wembley. \"It's a whole new experience but I'm enjoying it. I don't know how I'll feel on the first tee tomorrow, but I'm sure I will be nervous. I was nervous as a seasoned footballer playing at Old Trafford or Anfield. That's normal. \"Ernie and Retief and these guys are nervous too. Hopefully my years of playing football at a high level will help me out.\" Wegerle, who narrowly failed to qualify for the South African Open in Durban last week, signed for Chelsea in 1986 and went on to play for Luton, QPR, Blackburn and Coventry during his career in England, and also for the Tampa Bay Rowdies. He made 230 league appearances in total, with perhaps his most successful spell coming at Loftus Road between December 1989 and March 1992 when he scored 29 goals in 75 games. \"Turning professional was very unexpected,\" added Wegerle, who was born in nearby Pretoria - his family still live in Johannesburg - but qualified to play for the USA through his wife. \"I quit football in August 1998 after the World Cup in France and just decided to try something else. I could always hit a golf ball but I never really knew what the game was all about. I played a few rounds with Kenny Dalglish, Alan Shearer and Ray Wilkins, we all loved it but knew nothing about it. \"I started playing and gradually things started to fall into place. I started enjoying the game and one thing led to another, and here we are now. I came out originally to visit my family and thought I would bring my clubs along and try a few of these qualifiers, just for experience more than anything else.\" Wegerle's career was cut short by knee injuries - he had 10 operations - but he did play in the World Cup finals in 1994 and 1998, and admitted today that: \"I have no regrets about my football career. \"We don't get much English football in the US but when I come across it I like to watch it, although it makes me pine to get back. If it wasn't for my knees I could be playing now like Strachan and those guys did. \"Golf was a nice alternative because there is no-one trying to break your leg.\" Maybe not, but with Julian Dicks, the former West Ham and Liverpool defender also trying make a career as a professional golfer since injury cut short his top-flight career, the competition promises to be fierce. \"I have a scar under my chin from Julian Dicks in an FA Cup semi-final!\" Wegerle said. \"That's the memory I have of Julian. Maybe we will meet up on the golf course sometime.\" That may be some way off, with Wegerle so far proving more successful at swapping his football boots for golf spikes. From a 10 handicap on quitting football, he was quickly down to two before a longer battle to get down to his current plus three at his home course in Florida. Attempts to qualify for tournaments on the Buy.com tour in America have so far been unsuccessful, but the USPGA Tour's qualifying school in November this year - as well as possibly the European Challenge Tour - remain targets. \"I became pro about six months ago,\" added Wegerle, who fired a four-under-par 68 to finish joint third of 119 starters at Zwartkop Country Club, one of the two qualifying courses, on Tuesday. \"There is a celebrity tour in the States that all the top celebs like Michael Jordan and Dan Marino play in, I played in one event and won about four or five thousand dollars and that made me a professional.\" Whether Wegerle can simply make the cut this week remains to be seen, but simply by qualifying he has joined that exclusive club of people able to play more than one sport at the highest level. But as Dicks has discovered to his cost, the mental approach to golf can make or break even the most talented of players. \"In team sports you have someone to help you out if you make a mistake and vice-versa, but in this game you are all alone. When things go wrong it's a very lonely place to be. \"It's a very good challenge for me to play golf as an individual. There is no-one to help you so it's a test of your own character. \"When I started out three years ago everybody said golf was a mental game and I said 'How the hell can it be mental? You just have to hit the ball'. \"But when you get to this level you appreciate how much is mental. All these guys can boom it down the middle and hit the greens. Then you've got to have the mental composure to do the job when you need to. I appreciate it more now than I did a couple of years ago.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
