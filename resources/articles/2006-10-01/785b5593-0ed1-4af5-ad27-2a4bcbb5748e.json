Pakistan were incensed by the umpire's ruling that their team had tampered with the ball during the fourth test against England in August, a decision that led to a forfeiture of the match. Inzamam, the Pakistan captain, was cleared of ball tampering by the International Cricket Council on Thursday but banned for four one-day internationals for the second charge of bringing the game into disrepute. \"We have three reactions to the verdict,\" Khan said. \"Firstly, the hearing was very fair and very just. Secondly we have decided not to appeal after consulting the captain, Inzamam-ul-Haq. Thirdly, the issue was dealt with on merit. There were no political manoeuvrings in the background.\" The PCB has welcomed the ICC's decision to remove Darrell Hair from the list of umpires at the Champions Trophy in India. Khan said Pakistan would accept a decision allowing the Australian umpire to stand again in international matches but the PCB have asked that he be omitted from any future games involving Pakistan. Khan added: \"I wouldn't say that I am happy to see him [do so] but I would say that I have no objection to him umpiring matches in which the ICC feels that he is secure.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
