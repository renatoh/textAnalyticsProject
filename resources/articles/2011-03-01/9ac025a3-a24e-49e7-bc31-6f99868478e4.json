Only nine of every 100 babies born at 23 weeks survives; only one in 100 reaches adulthood without disability. In 2009 science writer Adam Wishart made a thoughtful, if dispiriting film called The Price of Life, about the exorbitant cost to the NHS of new cancer drugs that often did little to prolong life, and the difficult decisions surrounding their approval. Last night he was back with 23 Week Babies: The Price of Life (BBC2), which dealt with a similar dilemma and an even more harrowing subject. Given the statistics, filming very premature infants in the neonatal unit at Birmingham Women's Hospital wasn't going to produce too many happy endings. There are only so many babies I can watch die in the space of an hour \u2013 babies the size of baked potatoes, overwhelmed by tubes, wires and monitors. Some of the scenes bordered on intrusive \u2013 they certainly felt that way from a viewer's perspective \u2013 but I think a film like this needs to rake the soul a little bit, so you get it. The question at the heart of the film was whether such intervention serves any purpose, other than to cause unnecessary suffering. The women on the medical team at Birmingham Women's Hospital mostly seemed to think keeping babies alive at 23 weeks was a bad idea, while acknowledging that parents will almost always choose to cling to slender threads of hope. One father said turning off the machines would be like killing his own child; you could hardly argue that he was missing the point. In the Netherlands, they don't resuscitate 23-week-old babies \u2013 they let them die. Wishart put the case that the high cost of this largely fruitless intervention might be better spent combating the UK's premature birth rate \u2013 one of the highest in western Europe \u2013 but this heartbreaking programme wasn't really about the money. It was about a point in time where the limits of life and the limits of science refuse to overlap, a point where there are no desirable outcomes, a point at which it's almost impossible to imagine what you as a parent would decide. Given that discipline is the biggest stumbling block at Jamie's Dream School (Channel 4), it's interesting to see which of the celebrity teachers has got the knack of controlling a classroom. Soul2Soul's Jazzy B has it; Simon Callow hasn't. Alastair Campbell, who is always finding new ways to embody arrogance (he hums to himself when he walks), is a natural commander of attention, although it's rather telling that his introductory lesson on the cut and thrust of political debate led to a fight between two girls that almost got them both suspended. The central question of the second week was whether historian Dr David Starkey could be rehabilitated as a teacher, or if indeed he should be. His \"you're so fat\" comment to one of his students last week was so perfectly ill-advised that it seemed he could be sacked. In a crisis meeting with Jamie and the head, Starkey seemed to have little understanding of his mistake. He insisted it was the boy, Conor, who threw the first insult, even though we all saw different (Jamie didn't take issue with this, though, which made me wonder if last week's episode had been edited to make Starkey come off even worse). He then called Conor \"an arrogant, self-satisfied, porcine boy,\" adding, \"which means pig-like.\" Patronising git. But Starkey's pomposity could not long sustain itself in the school's atmosphere of enforced mateyness. The kids keep forgetting he's got a PhD and call him Mr Starkey. Colleague Jazzy B calls him \"Dave\" and Jamie refers to him as \"a busy boy\". Student Angelique greeted him in the hallway on his return to school and simply said, \"Mint, innee?\" He was indeed a new man, newly minted, both inspired and inspiring. If he sticks at it he might eventually learn something. I must confess I once found the Hairy Bikers a bit irritating, but I've now fallen completely under their spell. It is a rare example of TV personalities becoming more charming through unrelenting exposure. In The Great British Food Revival (BBC2) they set out to renew our interest in cauliflower, and I was powerless to resist their enthusiasm. I'm off to buy some now, even though I'm pretty certain I still hate it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
