Here\u2019s a summary of the main points. \u2022The prime minister David Cameron announced he would step down after failing to convince the country to vote to stay in the European Union in Thursday\u2019s referendum. \u2022The fallout started immediately: the pound collapsed, prompting recession fears, and by the end of the day Brexit panic had wiped $2tn off the world economy. \u2022European leaders reacted to the vote by insisting that Britain start negotiations to leave immediately. The UK has also been told that its access to the internal EU market would be restricted \u2013 the \u201cprice\u201d, it was said, for leaving. \u2022Political figures on both sides of the debate, however, insisted there was no need to rush through the process. \u2022The US tried to soothe British concerns about the status of the special relationship but President Obama reiterated his warning that the UK will go to the \u201cback of the queue\u201d for trade deal negotiations. \u2022Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, faced a challenge to his leadership as a group of his MPs tabled a motion of no confidence in it. President Barack Obama stands by his comment that Britain will move to the back of the queue when it comes to trade deals with the United States after Brexit, the White House said on Friday. \u201cObviously, the president stands by what he said and I don\u2019t have an update of our position,\u201d White House spokesman Eric Schultz said. Saturday\u2019s front pages are out and, unsurprisingly, the papers are all leading on Brexit. Equally unsurprisingly, they\u2019re heavily polarised. And there\u2019s even polarisation within the Daily Mail\u2019s offices. Meanwhile, Reuters reports that major Wall Street banks are scouring Europe to find a new home for their traders, bankers and financial licences. \u201cThe question becomes, where exactly do they move to? There\u2019s no clear answer on that. You might end up having a more fragmented financial industry in Europe,\u201d Edward Chan, a partner at law firm Linklaters, told the news agency. British financial institutions will have more limited access to the EU\u2019s internal market once it leaves the bloc, the chair of the council of eurozone finance ministers says. Jeroen Dijsselbloem told RTL television that some institutions would leave the City and that limited access was the price of Brexit. A few years ago, London took out adverts in the Asian edition of the Financial Times saying it was the place to come if you wanted to do business in the EU. Now they can\u2019t place that advert, and the Asians will go to Amsterdam or Frankfurt instead. The UK\u2019s longterm debt outlook was cut to \u2018negative\u2019 from \u2018stable\u2019 by the ratings agency Moody\u2019s, which said the Brexit vote would hit the country\u2019s medium-term growth outlook. It maintained the EU\u2019s outlook at \u2018stable\u2019. Moody\u2019s also affirmed European Union\u2019s AAA rating and the United Kingdom\u2019s Aa1 rating on Friday, Reuters reported. There are reports of anti-Brexit protests in Glasgow, Edinburgh and London. Hundreds gathered in Scotland to show their support for migrants and protest against what they describe as a \u201ctorrent of racism\u201d unleashed during the referendum campaign. In London, one group went to London Bridge \u2013 the site of the offices of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News UK, the parent company of the Sun and Times newspapers. The two papers took opposing stances on the referendum; the former backing Brexit and the latter Remain. About 30 were also reported to have demonstrated outside the gates of Downing Street, saying they had been \u201crobbed\u201d of their futures and chanting: \u201cNo borders! No Boris!\u201d The secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, Dr Shuja Shafi, has called for Britain\u2019s political leaders to unite the country after a campaign that has targeted immigrants. Clearly, this referendum has shown that there is disenchantment not only with the European Union but also with the way politics is carried out in our country. Our political leaders must now address these concerns in an inclusive and conciliatory way. We have witnessed a campaign that has been divisive and at times has led to the scapegoating of immigrants and minority groups. It is vitally important now that those in power must come together and heal divisions. We must also work hard to change the tone of our politics, to continue to be welcoming to those who are in need and to be an outward looking country. And while our country has voted to officially leave the European Union, we hope we can nevertheless retain bonds of friendship and peace with the rest of the continent. Reacting to the resignation of David Cameron, Dr Shuja Shafi said: We thank the prime minister for his public service. While the government\u2019s relationship with Muslim communities has been extremely challenging, we commend David Cameron for speaking out against Islamophobia. We hope his successor takes greater strides in working with Muslim communities and in resisting the temptation of xenophobia and intolerance that this result could possibly bring. The Muslim Council of Britain did not take a position during the referendum campaign, but did urge British Muslims to exercise their vote. The UK should be denied access to the single market if it does not comply with EU environmental laws in areas such as chemicals and food safety, the vice-chair of the European parliament\u2019s environment committee tells the Guardian. Benedek J\u00e1vor, a Green MEP, said: \u201cIf food safety standards or chemical standards are weakened in the UK, it raises the issue of the compatibility of British products with the EU market. \u201cI believe that if the UK is to stay in the single market, we have to ensure that its products fulfil all of the EU\u2019s environmental and food safety standards.\u201d Beyond questions of market access, the UK is likely to soon be cut free from EU laws such as the birds and habitats directive, which anchors the world\u2019s largest coordinated network of protected nature reserves. These spread across 18% of European territory \u2013 and 8% of Britain \u2013 providing havens to threatened wildlife and sites of natural beauty. More exits from the EU are inevitable if the bloc maintains its current course, Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has said, according to Reuters. The French newspaper Lib\u00e9ration has released its weekend edition front page. A slightly mocking headline, with a subheading that reads: \u201cShock in the UK and plenty of questions among other EU nations after the Boris Johnson-backed Brexit win.\u201d More quotes from President Obama are now emerging. He, too, is calling for Britain\u2019s special relationship with the US to persist. While the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU will change, one thing that will not change is the special relationship that exists between our two nations. That will endure. The EU will remain one of our indispensable partners. The Pentagon has sought to calm fears for the special relationship after the Brexit vote, insisting that the United States is confident Britain will remain a strong ally in Nato, which \u201cwill continue to perform its very important function\u201d. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, has called for Brexit negotiations to start straightaway, arguing that there is no need to wait until October. He told Germany\u2019s ARD television station: Britons decided yesterday that they want to leave the European Union, so it doesn\u2019t make any sense to wait until October to try to negotiate the terms of their departure. I would like to get started immediately. He said the EU would pursue a \u201creasonable approach\u201d in negotiating the separation. \u201cIt\u2019s not an amicable divorce, but it was not exactly a tight love affair anyway.\u201d President Obama has paid tribute to David Cameron at a summit in California. David has been an outstanding friend and partner on the global stage and, based on our conversation, I\u2019m confident that the UK is committed to an orderly transition out of the EU. We agreed that our economic and financial teams will remain in close contact as we stay focused on ensuring economic growth and financial stability. I then spoke to Chancellor [Angela] Merkel of Germany and we agreed that the United States and our European allies will work closely together in the weeks and months ahead. I do think yesterday\u2019s vote speaks to the ongoing changes and challenges that are raised by globalisation. The mayor of Calais has raised the prospect of migrants camped in Calais could be sent to the UK as a result of Brexit because it could see the unravelling of the border deal that currently keeps many of them in France. Natacha Bouchart told French broadcaster BFM TV: The British must take on the consequences of their choice. We are in a strong position to push, to press this request for a review and we are asking the president to bring his weight [to the issue]. We must put everything on the table and there must be an element of division, of sharing. This echoed calls from Xavier Bertrand, the centre-right president of the Hauts-de-France region, who tweeted: \u201cThe English wanted to take back their freedom, they must take back their border.\u201d The US would have preferred a remain vote, the US vice president, Joe Biden, has said on a visit to Ireland. In a speech at Dublin Castle, he attacked \u201creactionary politicians and demagogues peddling xenophobia, nationalism and isolationism\u201d and said the US wanted to keep growing economic ties with the European Union. Of course, yesterday a majority of the British people voted to leave the European Union, and as longstanding friends of the United Kingdom, the United States respects their decision. [It is] not how we would have preferred it to be. But we respect their position. After cancelling his planned appearance at Glastonbury, Jeremy Corbyn is now believed to be preparing to give a speech tomorrow morning instead. Amid moves to depose him as Labour leader, a source says he intends to set out a \u201cLabour vision for the future\u201d following the Brexit vote. Jeremy Corbyn has given an interview to Channel 4 News. He urged Dame Margaret Hodge to withdraw her no confidence motion. Margaret is obviously entitled to do what she wishes to do. I would ask her to think for a moment: a Tory prime minister resigned, Britain\u2019s voted to leave the European Union, there are massive political issues to be addressed - is it really a good idea to start a big debate in the Labour party when I was elected less than a year ago with a very large mandate \u2013 not from MPs, I fully concede and understand that, but from the party members as a whole? But Ben Bradshaw, the Labour former culture secretary, has just told Sky News that Corbyn should resign. He said that David Cameron had taken responsibility and resigned, and that Corbyn should do the same. Jeremy is a decent man. He believes in the interests of the Labour party and I think the wise thing for him to do now would be to reflect, do the honourable thing and step down, and let us go forward under a new leadership. That\u2019s all from me. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over. The Labour MP Graham Jones has said he is \u201cinclined\u201d to back Dame Margaret Hodge\u2019s motion of no confidence in Jeremy Corbyn. He said: Vast swathes of white working-class voters, particularly north of the Trent, turned their backs on our message and our leader. I want a damn good explanation from Jeremy Corbyn as to why we ended up in this mess. If I am not satisfied, I will support the motion. The Labour MP Stephen Kinnock has backed the no confidence motion too. The referendum results means that the prospect of a third runway being built at Heathrow must now be slim. The Davies commission said it should go ahead last year, and the government was due to make a final decision soon after the referendum. But the leave vote means it is likely that David Cameron will be replaced by Boris Johnson, a strong opponent of a Heathrow third runway. John Stewart, chairman of anti-Heathrow expansion group Hacan, said: Brexit must cast doubts on whether a third runway at Heathrow will ever be given the green light. The prime minister and the chancellor have lost the fight of their lives. Outers like Boris Johnson, who is fiercely opposed to Heathrow expansion, have won. At the very least, a decision on a new runway must now be up in the air. The Davies commission said a new runway at Gatwick would be an acceptable alternative. That is an option Johnson could support. Here is the Guardian Politics Weekly podcast, with Tom Clark, Heather Stewart, Matthew D\u2019Ancona, Hugh Muir and Jennifer Rankin discussing the referendum. Jeremy Clarkson, who backed remain in the referendum, has told the nation that it is just going to have to \u201cmake this shit shower work\u201d. Responding to the statement from the 12 union leaders who are defending Jeremy Corbyn (see 5.10pm), Dame Margaret Hodge told the Guardian that they were showing themselves to be out of touch with the views of their own members. This has been a tumultuous referendum which has been a test of leadership. Jeremy has failed that test. There will be a series of incredibly important decisions and negotiations with the EU over the next few year. Are we really saying that we send Jeremy Corbyn on our behalf? Does he have the necessary qualities? There is probably going to be a general election within a year. Do we want Jeremy Corbyn to lead us in to that election? He has shown us that he can\u2019t do it. We have someone in the position of leader who has shown that he can\u2019t lead. A desperate scramble for EU passports is under way after Britain voted to leave the union. There has been a spike in the number of online searches for \u201cgetting an Irish passport\u201d, and some European citizens publicly offered themselves \u2013 probably jokingly \u2013 in marriage, my colleague Luke Harding reports. \u201cThat\u2019s it, I think we should declare Glastonbury an independent nation-state.\u201d As word of the referendum results slowly rippled across the festival campsite on Friday morning, bleary eyed campers grappled both with hangovers and the realisation that they were unzipping their tents to a UK changed forever. And for the many of the 180,000 ticket-holders who were firmly in the remain camp, talk soon jokingly turned to \u201cGlexit\u201d. It was a noticeably sombre mood that gripped Worthy Farm as the first acts of the festivals took to the stage under darkening clouds. The 50-piece Syrian National Orchestra for Arabic Music, accompanied by Blur frontman and founder of the African Express project Damon Albarn opened the Other Stage. Albarn did not mince his words as he spoke of his anger at the referendum results. \u201cI have a heavy heart today,\u201d he said to the gathered crowds. \u201cDemocracy has failed us. Democracy has failed us because it was ill informed. And I want all of you to know that when we all leave here, we can change that decision. It is possible.\u201d It was a strangely uplifting performance, as the audience were reminded there are places in the world worse to be even than a broken Britain. \u201cIt\u2019s really emotional. It suddenly brings it all to the front of your mind how united we should be, when you consider what these people from Syria are going through,\u201d said Tanya Chesworth. \u201cThat made my Glastonbury. It\u2019s brought unity after what we have woken up to,\u201d said Mitch Pendered, who lives in Switzerland but comes from Devon and voted remain. The political mood also gripped other stages. As Novelist, the grime artist, took to the stage he started up a rousing chant of \u201cFuck David Cameron\u201d, while the guitarist from rock band James told the crowd: \u201cIt is with incredible sadness that we stand here today, unified in sadness that our country has turned on people. Fuck them!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like Yugoslavia without the bombs, a country disintegrating,\u201d said Robert Smith from Swindon. Spirits were also not lifted by the weather, which by midday had turned to torrential rain and did little to improve the treacherously muddy conditions underfoot. The Other Stage was almost an hour late opening and logistical difficulties meant the controversial women-only Sisterhood stage, which was due to host various female-led performances and even a twerking workshop, was still not open on Friday. The seismic referendum aftermath also led to the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, pulling out of his appearance at the Left Field tent on Sunday, with a spokesperson saying he was focusing on \u201cmomentous\u201d results. Nonetheless, Corbyn\u2019s continued popularity with young voters was re-affirmed as mere mention of his name in the tent prompted a huge cheer. And while many festivalgoers tried to focus their efforts on forgetting politics for the rest of the weekend, throwing themselves into watching acts such as Skepta, Sigur R\u00f3s and headliners Muse, the Left Field remained a hive of heated political discussion. Speaking before his performance, Glastonbury stalwart Billy Bragg offered a call to arms to the young generation, the majority of whom voted to stay in the EU. Admitting he had not voted when he first got the vote in 1979, Bragg said now was not the time for political apathy. \u201cMy guess is there\u2019s a lot of young people who woke up this morning thinking \u2018there\u2019s absolutely no way this country would be so stupid to vote us out\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cYou probably thought there\u2019s no point in going to the polling station, I\u2019ll let someone else do that. I\u2019m not here to condemn them, after I made the mistake I got stuck into the fight. So now it\u2019s your job to get stuck in.\u201d A message echoed by Clive Lewis, Labour MP for Norfolk South, who called for \u201cprogressives\u201d to \u201crebuild\u201d, \u201cbe resolute\u201d and help him make the world know that \u201cthe England Nigel Farage represents is not the UK I want to be part of\u201d. Momentum, the Labour organisation for Jeremy Corbyn supporters, has started an online petition supporting him. This is from James Schneider, Momentum\u2019s national organiser. The Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge has told Sky News that she is is tabling a motion of no confidence in Jeremy Corbyn because the EU referendum was a \u201ctest of leadership\u201d and Corbyn failed. The European referendum was a test of leadership and I think Jeremy failed that test. He came out too slowly, he was very half-hearted about his attempts to campaign and Labour voters simply didn\u2019t get the message. I hope, in the context of a secret ballot, that there will be overwhelming support for this motion I am putting and Jeremy will do the decent thing and resign. Some other Labour MPs have backed the move. Chris Leslie, the former shadow chancellor, said: Every MP is going to have to search their conscience about it but I think I would need an awful lot of persuading to have confidence in Jeremy\u2019s leadership going into a general election. Caroline Flint, the former minister, said: The truth is that Jeremy\u2019s leadership doesn\u2019t seem to be reaching out to those parts of Britain, those parts of the Labour vote we depend on to win a general election. Ann Coffey, who has seconded Hodge\u2019s proposal for a no-confidence motion, said Corbyn needed to take responsibility for what had happened in the referendum. [Corbyn] needs to know that a substantial number of the parliamentary party have no confidence in his leadership and he needs to consider that and consider whether it is tenable to be leader when his parliamentary party does not support him. Sir John Major, the former Conservative prime minister, has told the BBC that David Cameron was right to announce that he is standing down. I think it\u2019s very sad that David has decided he has to go. I think he made the right decision. I think he had no choice. Major praised Cameron for his achievements with the economy. I think when people look back on his premiership they will see quite a few things. Upon the day he became prime minister our economy was on the precipice, our banks were very close to collapse, and the forecast was dire. We now have one of the strongest economies, our banks are much better prepared now than ever before to face any of the difficulties that will lie ahead, and I think that is very much to David Cameron\u2019s credit. Major also said that Cameron\u2019s social agenda had been \u201cvery progressive\u201d and that introducing marriage equality was a major change. Many people didn\u2019t like it, but there were many others who felt life was very harsh about their personal preferences, who will look back and say he brought a breath of fresh air and freedom to our lives that we hadn\u2019t had before. I think that is a very remarkable record, and I think he\u2019ll be remembered for it. The main trade unions affiliated to Labour have put out a joint statement saying MPs should not try to depose Jeremy Corbyn. The statement does not actually mention Corbyn by name, but it says a \u201cmanufactured leadership row\u201d would be an indulgence the party cannot afford. It says: The prime minister\u2019s resignation has triggered a Tory leadership crisis. At the very time we need politicians to come together for the common good, the Tory party is plunging into a period of argument and infighting. In the absence of a government that puts the people first Labour must unite as a source of national stability and unity. It should focus on speaking up for jobs and workers\u2019 rights under threat, and on challenging any attempt to use the referendum result to introduce a more right-wing Tory government by the back door. The last thing Labour needs is a manufactured leadership row of its own in the midst of this crisis and we call upon all Labour MPs not to engage in any such indulgence. The statement is signed by the general secretaries of 12 unions: Len McCluskey, Unite, Dave Prentis, Unison, Tim Roache, GMB, Dave Ward, Communication Workers Union, Brian Rye, Ucatt, Manuel Cortes, Transport Salaried Staffs Association, Mick Whelan, Aslef, Matt Wrack, Fire Brigades Union, John Smith, Musicians\u2019 Union, Gerry Morrissey, Bectu, Ronnie Draper, BFAWU, Chris Kitchen, National Union of Mineworkers. The Trade Union and Socialist Coalition (TUSC), the pro-Brexit leftwing group, has put out a statement calling for an early general election. This is from its chair, the former Labour MP Dave Nellist. TUSC opposes the EU as an \u2018employers union\u2019, implementing Thatcherism on a continental scale, and we welcome the decisive rejection of it in the referendum. This was a revolt against a system that is not delivering for the majority of working class people and many middle class people too. But Britain\u2019s political and economic establishment no more defends the interests of the majority than the EU does and the vote for change that was expressed in Thursday\u2019s poll will not be met by replacing one ex-Eton schoolboy with another. The labour and trade union movement must follow up this massive vote of no confidence in the Tory government and demand a general election now. Loss of UK sovereignty was one of the Brexiters\u2019 chief complaints in the referendum campaign and their resentment of foreign laws was aimed squarely at the European court of justice in Luxembourg. So now that the UK has voted to leave the EU what happens next? The EU\u2019s highest court, whose rulings are currently binding on British judges and parliament, became the object of venomous rhetoric during the campaign. Those attacks may now intensify. The justice secretary and leave campaigner, Michael Gove, denounced the Luxembourg court as a vehicle for giving the EU \u201cmore power and reach than ever before\u201d. Boris Johnson\u2019s wife, Marina Wheeler QC, published an influential article in February entitled Cavalier with our Constitution criticising the \u201cjurisdictional muscle-flexing of the court in Luxembourg\u201d since the EU\u2019s charter of fundamental rights came into force in 2009. The court, she added, acts \u201ccapriciously not judiciously\u201d. And in a joint statement earlier this month, the leaders of Vote Leave pledged to \u201cregain the power to deport terrorists and terrorist sympathisers and stop violent criminals entering the UK \u2013 powers that EU law currently denies to us.\u201d They would, the Vote Leave leaders said, \u201cimmediately end the application of the EU\u2019s charter of fundamental laws. This charter gives the rogue European court practically unlimited powers to extend its jurisdiction. By ending its application in UK law, we will take back control of how Britain implements the crucial 1951 UN convention on refugees and end the charter\u2019s ability to affect immigration and asylum law.\u201d One impact of the Brexit vote is that judgments from Luxembourg will eventually no longer apply to the UK. A judgment on bulk interception of communications data by GCHQ, the government\u2019s monitoring agency, is due imminently. But the impact could come before the end of the two-year process of Brexit renegotiation. In the aftermath of the leave vote, rulings could be challenged in parliament and by Eurosceptic lawyers even before the UK formally cuts its ties with Brussels. Those British judges already serving in Luxembourg are likely to stay in the court for their remaining period of service. And the consequences of the leave vote are likely to take years to work through, as MPs assess which elements of EU law should be preserved, and which rejected. The European arrest warrant is one of the continental law and order agreements that may have to be re-examined. London\u2019s planned status as home to one of the main registries for a European unified patent court will now also be in doubt. Perhaps the biggest question for UK citizens though is what happens to the rights and legal protections that are currently afforded by EU membership. That is an open question that was barely touched on by the leave side during the campaign beyond broad statements of reassurance. Philip Kolvin QC of Cornerstone Barristers, who is an expert in licensing, said: \u201cThe consequences for our legal system have barely figured in [the debate]. But EU-inspired or mandated legislation is part of the bedrock of societal protection. Are these protections to be thrown onto a bonfire of laws? If not, which are to survive and which are to be replaced, and if so by what?\u201d My colleague Ewen MacAskill has joined the (very, very long, and mostly honourable) list of people who have been insulted by Donald Trump. It goes without saying that Trump is wrong. Europeans working in London have reacted to the referendum results with shock. Groups of 16 and 17-year-olds have been outside Downing Street protesting about the result, my colleague Ione Wells reports. Many displayed banners saying, \u201cwhere was our vote\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s our future\u201d. Several of the teenagers quoted the other rights they have at 16 and referenced the Scottish referendum, asking why they were not allowed to vote in a decision that would have a \u201chuge impact on our futures\u201d. \u201cWe are out here today, which shows we have political beliefs and know how to express them,\u201d one said. Another commented how she believed the result could have been significantly different were 16-year-olds allowed to vote, citing the 75% of 18-35 year olds who voted to remain. Ben, 26, sitting outside the gates of Downing Street protesting against the result, said: I should have been here a week ago, well, not here in London. We won comfortably here \u2013 but elsewhere, further afield, now I feel like we are all living with the result of not doing more while we could. He told the Guardian that for him the referendum \u201cwas not about economics, or migration, alone. It is about the sort of society, world and Europe that I wanted Britain to help create and maintain in the future\u201d. Ultimately, he said, he was very disappointed that the result was largely due to fears of immigration. \u201cThat makes me very sad,\u201d he continued, \u201cbecause endless studies have shown that migrants contribute more than they take out.\u201d Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, used a speech earlier today to launch a strong attack on Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s conduct during the election campaign. With politicians of all parties working together, one of the things that stood out in this campaign, was Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s bizarre refusal to share a platform in the face of the greatest challenge our country was faced in a generation. I have stood alongside Gordon Brown, Harriet Harman, Chukka Umunna, Andy Burnham and Sadiq Khan. Great progressive Labour politicians that I admire \u2013 forced to campaign with their hands tied behind their back because of short-sighted demands from their leader\u2019s office. Where was the leader of that party? Even when the future of our country depended on him, he could not bring himself to reach across the aisle. When the call went out for help, Jeremy Corbyn refused to answer. The once-proud working class Labour vote has abandoned Corbyn in droves. Great Labour cities have been driven into the arms of Ukip and Nigel Farage. It is clearer than ever that Jeremy Corbyn has more concern for his own position in his own party, rather than his country. Farron also urged people who wanted \u201ca new modern breed of politics \u2013 liberal, hopeful, international, rational \u2013 driven by real British values\u201d to join the Lib Dems. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has put out a statement saying the EU referendum vote represents \u201ca decisive rejection of the Conservative\u2019s economic policy, resulting in stagnant real wages for a decade and widespread disaffection where people have not shared in prosperity\u201d. He said the government should abandon its budget surplus target for 2019-20, launch an investment programme and give up plans to have an emergency austerity budget. He said: Labour will not allow any instability to be paid for by the working people of this country. There is no justification or mandate whatsoever for an emergency austerity budget. We need a clear programme of action to protect our economy. Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, is speaking to journalists in Washington. She says it will take some time to work out what the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU will be. And she welcomes the moves taken by the Bank of England today to assure the markets, she says. EU climate change officials are calling for an early signal of intent from a post-Brexit UK government that it will remain committed to joint European action on global warming. Of particular interest for Europe is whether the UK shows it is still attached to last year\u2019s Paris climate deal, the 2020 climate targets and, above all, the bloc\u2019s carbon market, the Emissions Trading System (ETS). Committing to stay in the ETS, as non-EU countries Switzerland and Norway have done, would demonstrate that the new UK government was prepared to honour existing international agreements, sources say. \u201cIt is not impossible to imagine that kind of overture coming from the British side,\u201d one senior official told the Guardian. \u201cEverything is going to be a political football now, and it is just whether we play nicely with climate policy or not. There are mutual benefits to playing nicely.\u201d The UK is unlikely to renege on carbon emissions reduction targets for 2020 that it has already substantially met. But the country is lagging on renewable energy goals and has credible enforcement mechanisms to rectify that have just disappeared. Good afternoon. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Haroon. The American ambassador to London, Matthew Barzun, has been tweeting about the referendum result. The commuter town of Watford was England\u2019s most divided town last night, voting to leave the EU by a majority of just 252 votes. Local politicians describe a fractious campaign season in a town that has a long history as a bellwether, switching between Tory and Labour MPs. Ahsan Khan, a Labour councillor, said that it was \u201cprobably the most representative population in the country\u201d, with a mix of commuters and those who work locally, and an immigrant population that is \u201cnot huge, but not small either\u201d. He said he had suspected in recent weeks that the town would vote to leave: \u201cWe probably didn\u2019t realise soon enough that we need to work harder.\u201d The local campaign was \u201cpolarised\u201d and \u201cpassionate\u201d, local Lib Dem councillor Stephen Johnson said. \u201cOne of my colleagues was spat at twice on a street stall. It brought out quite a lot of intolerance. It was quite bad-tempered.\u201d But not for everybody. Sheltering in the shopping mall from yet another downpour with their five-week-old baby, Andrea Garcia and her husband Dominic said that they had backed opposite sides. \u201cIn the last few days we were talking about it,\u201d Andrea said, but there were \u201cno arguments\u201d. On hearing the outcome, Dominic Garcia, an engineer, said: \u201cI was \u2013 gutted\u2019s not the word - but shocked that it\u2019s happening.\u201d He was concerned about \u201cbacktracking\u201d by leave-supporting politicians, he said, \u201cespecially about the \u00a3350m to the NHS. That was on the side of a bus and now it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d The Leave campaign in Wales has been holding a celebration in Newport, one of the many Labour strongholds that voted out. The venue was carefully chosen \u2013 in front of a statue erected in memory of Chartism, the 19th century working class movement for political reform. The music was more obvious \u2013 the theme from the Great Escape. Nathan Gill, the Ukip leader in Wales, said the setting was significant. Chartism was founded in Wales; it was a grassroots organisation. We have a grassroots organisation. There are people here from all political parties. There\u2019re all kinds of different people. The Chartists knew what they wanted \u2013 the fundamental causes on their charter. We knew what we wanted, we could boil it down to one thing: we want our country back. The celebration was heckled by a passer-by who accused the Leave activists of being racists. Gill denied the accusation. He said: We\u2019re the party that have been saying what all these people have been thinking and worrying about for years. The number one issue throughout the whole of Wales is immigration. Let\u2019s face it, look around, there is very little immigration. So why is it the issue? Many people in Wales go to England, they have family there, they work there. We\u2019ve seen what has happened in England and we don\u2019t want it to happen in Wales. People don\u2019t want their communities changed beyond recognition. They are very happy with their communities. That\u2019s why there is this fear. It\u2019s based on what they have observed. He also pointed out the empty shops near the statue. People aren\u2019t daft. We\u2019re in a very depressed area. All this talk of this huge amount of EU money, where is it? Gill was joined by Tory MP for Monmouth David Davies, who has campaigned for Leave. He said: I think people here feel they haven\u2019t been listened to for years. People are fed up. They haven\u2019t been listened to on issues like immigration. They feel they have been ignored by all the political parties. There were people of all political persuasions at the event, some of whom have been getting a tough time for supporting leave. \u201cPeople have called me racist, they have been swearing at me,\u201d said student Luke Carlmain, 27. I\u2019m not racist. I like immigration. I don\u2019t want immigration to stop. I just want it controlled. I think Brussels simply has too much power. Should the Labour first minister, Carwyn Jones, follow David Cameron and resign because of his part in the failed remain campaign? \u201cI\u2019d like to see him go. I think he has to think very carefully,\u201d said Carlmain. Jeremy Corbyn has cancelled his appearance at Glastonbury after the referendum result. The Labour leader had been scheduled to speak on Sunday at an event called Jez We Can: Jeremy Corbyn in Conversation, which would have made him the first Labour leader to appear at Pilton. A spokesman confirmed to the Press Association that he would be \u201cfocusing on the issues\u201d thrown up by the \u201cmomentous\u201d vote rather than travelling to Worthy Farm. He is also facing a no confidence motion from two of his MPs. It wasn\u2019t just a bad night for Europhiles and David Cameron, but also for pollsters, who misread the mood of the electorate in the run-up to the vote. Of 168 polls carried out since the EU referendum wording was decided last September, fewer than a third (55 in all) predicted a leave vote. The actual result on the night came in at 51.9% leave, 48.1% remain. Just 16 of 168 individual polls predicted a 52:48 split in favour of leave. Polls did give a sense of the swing to leave in the first weeks of June, but edged back to favour remain in the final days before the vote. Just two of six polls released the day before the referendum \u2013 those carried out TNS and Opinium \u2013 gave leave the edge. Two senior Iranian officials reacted with glee at the Brexit vote, although there has not been an official statement from the administration of President Hassan Rouhani. Hamid Aboutalebi, a senior political aide to Rouhani, said on Twitter: A big earthquake has shaken Europe and England has left the EU, the stars of the EU\u2019s flag are falling down. The economic developments in the countries situated in the southern Europe and the immigration crisis show that the [European] union is collapsing and Brexit has triggered the domino effect [of this collapse]. The leaving of England from the EU is a historic opportunity for Iran and we should make the most out of this new opportunity. Deputy chief of staff of Iran\u2019s armed forces, Massoud Jazayeri, was quoted by the Fars news agency as saying that \u201cthe European Union is a pawn in the hands of America\u201d. He added: England should pay the price of years of imperialism and committing crimes against humanity. The people of Ireland, Scotland and others have the right to bring themselves out of the tyrannical rule of the [British] monarchy, the so-called Great Britain. Michael Sani from youth voter movement Bite the Ballot said he understood the feelings of helplessness and anger from the younger generation but that turnout had been affected by the direction of both campaigns. If no one inspires you, that is how you end up being marginalised, divided and fearing. This generation are so passionate, they care so much about issues but they are just not empowered to use the means of communication to get through to make real change. Both campaigns have been a disaster in terms of meaningful engagement on such complex issues. There was still opportunity to make the issues that the younger generation care about a priority during the Brexit negotiations, Sani said. What people need to do now if they are angry is harness that feeling, these negotiations are still to come, and young people need to be at the table or they will end up being on the menu yet again. The Guardian\u2019s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, and columnist Gary Younge are taking live questions on the referendum result now. Here is a Guardian video of European leaders, including Jean-Claude Juncker, who said the UK must act on the vote \u201cas soon as possible, however painful that process may be\u201d. Like Obama, Hillary Clinton has responded to the Brexit vote by reaffirming the special relationship with the UK. She has also used it as an opportunity to take a swipe at her rival for the US presidency, Donald Trump, calling for \u201ccalm, steady, experienced leadership\u201d: We respect the choice the people of the United Kingdom have made. Our first task has to be to make sure that the economic uncertainty created by these events does not hurt working families here in America. We also have to make clear America\u2019s steadfast commitment to the special relationship with Britain and the transatlantic alliance with Europe. This time of uncertainty only underscores the need for calm, steady, experienced leadership in the White House to protect Americans\u2019 pocketbooks and livelihoods, to support our friends and allies, to stand up to our adversaries, and to defend our interests. It also underscores the need for us to pull together to solve our challenges as a country, not tear each other down. Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has welcomed \u201ccommitments\u201d from the Bank of England and the European Central Bank (ECB) to try to shore up the markets. She said: We take note of the decision by the people of the United Kingdom. We urge the authorities in the UK and Europe to work collaboratively to ensure a smooth transition to a new economic relationship between the UK and the EU, including by clarifying the procedures and broad objectives that will guide the process. We strongly support commitments of the Bank of England and the ECB to supply liquidity to the banking system and curtail excess financial volatility. We will continue to monitor developments closely and stand ready to support our members as needed. A Channel 4 correspondent in Barnsley, Yorkshire, where 68% voted to leave, has been interrupted by people shouting \u201csend them home\u201d. The Nasdaq, like the Dow Jones, is down significantly: The Turkish prime minister, Binali Yildirim, said that the European Union needed to carefully reconsider its political vision after Britain\u2019s exit vote. \u201cThe EU should read this development very carefully and reassess its vision for the future,\u201d Yildirim said in a televised speech on Friday. Turkish EU minister \u00d6mer Celik brushed aside fears that the UK exit would spell yet more trouble for the country\u2019s stalled EU accession talks, as Britain had previously been one of the strongest supporters of a Turkey membership. He said in a TV broadcast: We expect that a more realistic union will emerge after this. There will be more opportunities and new possibilities for Turkey. Whatever will happen next, it will be better for Turkey. As a European power and a European democracy we will keep watching this process. Co-chair of the main opposition Republican People\u2019s party (CHP) \u00d6zt\u00fcrk Yilmaz criticised the strategy to vilify Turkey as part of the referendum campaign. The Brexit camp had argued that Turks were inherently disposed to criminality and that all of them were desperate to come to the UK, whereas David Cameron had suggested that Turkish membership was not even \u201cremotely on the cards\u201d and that the country may not join until the year 3000. All throughout the campaign, those lobbying to leave and those lobbying to remain in the EU used Turkey in a disgusting way. It was a vile campaign. They made Turkey the scapegoat and demonised [the country]. We were very uncomfortable with the way this bad Turkey campaign was used in UK politics. The US stock exchange has experienced a sharp fall on opening. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, is spending the day in a \u201ccalming operation,\u201d speaking to business groups to reassure them that Britain won\u2019t be leaving the EU overnight. \u201cHe\u2019s saying, \u2018let\u2019s not rush into anything; let\u2019s stay calm and try and do our best with this situation: we need to do our jobs,\u201d said a department for business source. In a text less than an hour after the victory for leave was declared, the Sun\u2019s editor Tony Gallagher told the Guardian: \u201cSo much for the waning power of the print media.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s head of media, Jane Martinson, writes: The Sun, which came out last week with a union jack-draped front cover urging its readers to \u201cBeLeave in Britain\u201d and at 6am on Friday published \u201cSee EU later\u201d, did not rise against the EU alone. British newspapers were overwhelmingly in favour of Brexit, with the Mail, Telegraph, Express and Star accounting for four times as many readers and anti-EU stories as their pro-remain rivals. \u201cIf you believe in Britain, vote leave,\u201d urged the Mail on Wednesday, lambasting the \u201clies\u201d and \u201cgreedy elites\u201d of a \u201cbroken, dying Europe\u201d on its front page. Such headlines were not just the hallmark of an increasingly bitter referendum campaign \u2013 with its relentless focus on anti-immigration stories \u2013 but came after years of anti-EU reporting in most of the British press. In February, the Mail front page asked simply \u201cWho will speak for England?\u201d, highlighting the causes of independence and nationhood that have so helped the leave campaign. As the UK considers the far-reaching consequences of leaving the EU, it seems as good a moment as any to consider who has now spoken for England \u2013 the people alone or a Eurosceptic press that has campaigned against Brussels for decades. The US president, Barack Obama, has said that Britain will remain a key ally, as will the EU: The people of the United Kingdom have spoken, and we respect their decision. The special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is enduring, and the United Kingdom\u2019s membership in Nato remains a vital cornerstone of US foreign, security, and economic policy. So too is our relationship with the European Union, which has done so much to promote stability, stimulate economic growth, and foster the spread of democratic values and ideals across the continent and beyond. The United Kingdom and the European Union will remain indispensable partners of the United States even as they begin negotiating their ongoing relationship to ensure continued stability, security, and prosperity for Europe, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the world. In an address to the Gibraltar parliament, the chief minister, Fabian Picardo, hit back angrily at Spain\u2019s suggestion that the Brexit vote should give rise to joint sovereignty of the territory. He said: Let me be absolutely clear. Despite the noises that are bound to be made by some in the neighbouring nation - indeed, some have already been made this morning - this government is confident in the support from the British government that there will be not talks - or even talks about talks - against the express wishes of the people of Gibraltar in respect of the sovereignty of Gibraltar. In a dig at Spain\u2019s acting foreign minister, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda-Margallo, he added: So let others make irrelevant noises about flying flags over a rock if they want to waste their breath. Such ideas will never prosper. Gibraltar will never pay a sovereignty price for access to a market. Gibraltar will never be Spanish in whole, in part or at all. So I ask all our citizens to ignore these noises. Our work will be focused on the more pressing issues before us. Redirecting and protecting our economy are what we must all now focus on. A private exit poll conducted on Thursday by the businessman Lord Ashcroft showed that there was no difference between male and female voters \u2013 but very sharp differences between voters according to age, ethnicity, education and personal wealth. Most of those working full- or part-time voted to remain, for example, while most of those who are not working wanted to leave. More than half of those on a personal pension voted to leave, a figure that rose to two-thirds of those on a state pension. Some 55% of those who own their homes outright voted to leave. The older the voter, the more likely they were to vote to leave: 60% of those aged 65 or more voted to leave, while nearly three-quarters of 18-to-24-year- olds voted to remain. A large majority of those whose formal education ended at secondary school level voted to leave, while 67% of those with a university degree and 64% with a higher degree voted to remain. More than four-fifths of those voters still in full-time eduction voted to remain. Among those voters describing themselves as white, 53% voted to leave. More than two thirds of Asian voters and almost three-quarters of black voters wanted to remain. Some 58% of voters who described themselves as Christian voted to leave, while 70% of Muslims voted to remain. Analysis of voting patterns according to occupation showed that the so-called AB voters \u2013 people engaged in professional and managerial work \u2013 voted 57% to 43% in favour of remaining in the EU, while C1s \u2013 clerical and junior managerial workers \u2013 were divided evenly and C2DEs - skilled or unskilled white-collar and manual workers and those receiving benefits - voted overwhelmingly in favour of Brexit. Ashcroft\u2019s poll also showed that the majority of voters thought the remain campaign would win, including among those who voted to leave. The Guardian has charted David Cameron\u2019s years as prime minister \u201cfrom fresh-faced upstart to European failure\u201d. Spain\u2019s acting prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has sought to allay fears over Brexit\u2019s consequences for Britons in Spain and Spaniards in the UK. The leave vote has shocked many of the 300,000 Britons who are officially registered in Spain, particularly older expatriates who rely on the Spanish health system for medical care. In a televised address on Friday, Rajoy said the EU treaties governing Britain\u2019s relations with the rest of the bloc would remain in force while London negotiates the terms of its exit \u2013 a process he said could take \u201cat least two years\u201d. Their rights to move freely, to work, to pay social security contributions, to receive pensions, to invest, to vote or be elected in local elections will not be affected at all. The same applies to the rights of British citizens who live or work in our country or in the rest of the EU. Pablo Iglesias, leader of Spain\u2019s anti-austerity party Podemos tweeted that it was a \u201csad day for Europe\u201d, adding: \u201cNo one would want to leave a fair and supportive Europe. We have to change Europe.\u201d The fate of Gibraltar appeared less clear after Spain\u2019s acting foreign minister, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda-Margallo, said the leave vote had brought the prospect of a Spanish flag flying on the rock of Gibraltar closer. One investment bank is already moving staff overseas, according to the BBC. UPDATE: Morgan Stanley has denied this: One of its rivals, JP Morgan, said earlier that there could be changes to \u201cthe location of some roles\u201d. The Norwegian minister for the European affairs, Elisabeth Aspaker, told the Guardian that Brexit marked a \u201closs for European cooperation\u201d but said the results did not mean the UK could withdraw from the EU immediately. Norway\u2019s relationship with the EU will not be directly affected by the UK referendum. [However], it is a loss for European cooperation that a British majority wants the UK to leave the EU. But naturally, we respect the British people\u2019s decision. The Norwegian minister said it was unclear what sort of association the UK will want to have with the EU, and not least what sort of arrangement the other EU member states will offer the UK after it leaves. According to Aspaker, if a new agreement between the EU and the UK is not in place before the UK formally withdraws from the EU, trade with the UK will be governed by the World Trade Organisation rules. Norway\u2019s trade with the UK will be regulated by the EEA [European Economic Area] agreement until the UK has formally left the EU. For more than 20 years, Norway and the UK have been part of the same internal market, where the free movement of goods, services, capital and people is ensured. Some 8% of Norway\u2019s mainland exports go to the UK. If you include oil and gas, the figure is around 22%.\u201d When the UK formally leaves the EU, the EEA agreement will no longer provide the framework for Norwegian\u2013UK trade. It is therefore important for us that new arrangements are negotiated that enable us to maintain trade and cooperation with our UK partners. The chancellor, George Osborne, does not appear to be following David Cameron in leaving office \u2013 not voluntarily anyway. Still in any doubt as to the momentousness of the vote? The BBC has also made a lot of changes to its schedule, including extending the News at One, the News at 10, airing a one-off special with Nick Robinson on BBC One and extending Newsnight. On the radio, all the main news bulletins on BBC Radio 2 and BBC Radio 4 are to be extended and BBC Radio 5 live has cleared its schedule to provide live reaction and analysis until Saturday afternoon when it will resume coverage of Euro 2016. The short answer to what happens next with pollution, wildlife, farming, green energy, climate change and more is we don\u2019t know \u2013 we are in uncharted territory. But all the indications \u2013 from the \u201cred-tape\u201d slashing desires of the Brexiters to the judgment of environmental professionals \u2013 are that the protections for our environment will get weaker. From the air we breathe to the food we eat to the climate we live in, how we protect and enhance the environment underpins the healthy and happy lives we all aspire to, now and for generations to come. The Brexit vote leaves it highly uncertain which protections will remain in place and the prospect of improving them seems remote. Nigel Farage, the politician who did more than anyone to force the EU referendum, doesn\u2019t even think climate change is a problem and wants to scrap pollution limits on power stations. With 400,000 early deaths a year from air pollution \u2013 40,000 in the UK \u2013 the EU saw things differently and set new legal limits in 2010. Many UK cities and towns remain above those limits today and campaigners have used EU rules to successfully sue the UK government. But UK ministers are even now fighting new EU rules to reduce early deaths. Pollution does not stop in its tracks at national borders, and 88% of environment professionals in the UK think an EU-wide policy is needed. Earlier legal action from the EU forced the UK to clean up its sewage-strewn beaches, while many of the protections for nature and wildlife across the nation stem from EU rules. Pray for the UK (and its partners) is the message from the Bishops of the Church in Wales: In facing the outcome of the EU referendum, we commend a period of calm and reflection as the UK seeks to find its way forward in this new situation. As Christians we hold to the Gospel values of truthfulness, inclusion, and respect; and so after the passionate debate, we pray for reconciliation amongst the divided factions in our nations, communities and families. We pray for the United Kingdom and for our partners in Europe and the rest of the world at this time of uncertainty, as we continue to work together to build a just and peaceful future in which all people can flourish. The Press Gazette suggests the influence of rightwing papers could have been decisive in the referendum result. The editors of the Sun, Telegraph, Express and Mail titles can reflect today that it was probably them \u2018wot won it\u2019 for the leave campaign. This week they all declared for leave with prominent editorials. But throughout the campaign they have made their positions clear with front-page stories which have been chosen and written to benefit the leave side of the argument. Together these titles reach around 28 million readers in print over the course of the month, according to the National Readership Survey. With just over a one million votes separating the leave and remain sides their influence could well have been decisive. It notes that 26 out of the last 28 Daily Express pages were positive for the leave campaign. By contrast it says remain received \u201cluke-warm\u201d support from the Guardian, Times and Mirror. Handelsblatt says it has been leaked an eight-page emergency plan with the \u201cGerman strategy for Brexit\u201d. The newspaper says Germany would offer \u201cconstructive departure negotiations\u201d but divorce proceedings would be difficult, for example regarding Britain\u2019s involvement in the European investment bank. After the two-year period, the German government would aim for \u201cassociate status for the UK\u201d and Great Britain would become an \u201cassociate partner country\u201d. But the paper also says there would be \u201cno automatic access to the single market\u201d, for fear of encouraging other countries such as France, Austria, Finland or the Netherlands to follow Britain\u2019s lead. One would try to \u201cavoid offering false incentives for other member states when settling on new arrangements\u201d. It adds: \u201cThe extent of such imitation effects would depend largely on how Great Britain was being treated.\u201d Ukip\u2019s Wales campaign manager Sam Gould has been keeping his strength up with help from a steak and a pint of Coca-Cola. His home patch is Caerphilly, which has always returned Labour MPs. It was one of those Labour heartlands that voted resoundingly for out \u2013 57.6% against 42.4%. Gould rejects the idea put forward by the Labour first minister Carwyn Jones that such results were a protest against the Tory government in Westminster. \u201cThat is them trying to deflect attention,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to wake up and look at the facts.\u201d The real number one issue? It\u2019s uncontrolled immigration. We\u2019re having to build on a picturesque mountain. They are looking to build thousands of homes on green spaces. This is down to pressures on housing that immigration has contributed to. What next for Wales? We\u2019re going to be getting our freedom and democracy back. It brings hope to our steel industry, to our manufacturers, which have been decimated by the EU. Companies are struggling because of EU regulations. They now have hope. It is now about project hope. The SNP reports that it is experiencing a surge in membership applications that would seem to mirror that which took place in the hours and days immediately after the 2014 independence referendum and which saw the party swell to the third largest in the UK. A party source said that they were being \u201cinundated\u201d with emails from previous no voters now pledging their support for independence following the conclusion of the EU referendum earlier this morning. Meanwhile, other grass-roots pro-independence groups are reporting a similar trend. Women for Independence, one of the most successful campaign groups to emerge from the 2014 campaign, has already seen a spike this morning in people signing up, donating money, and identifying their local areas for activism. \u201cThe surge is back on\u201d said one activist. This picture shows Jeremy Corbyn watching David Cameron\u2019s resignation speech as people simultaneously take photos of the Labour leader. Nicola Sturgeon said her ministers were contacting Scottish business leaders today to reassure them. But one senior business figure, Lindsay Gardiner, regional chair of the consultants PwC Scotland, said raising the prospects of a second Scottish independence referendum was \u201cboth premature and unhelpful\u201d. Gardiner said: The UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU is already creating uncertainty and impacting business confidence in Scotland so to fuel speculation about another referendum at this early stage would be both premature and unhelpful. Grahame Smith, general secretary of the Scottish TUC, said there were substantial issues posed by a second independence referendum. While a second independence referendum will undoubtedly bring added uncertainty, the democratic wishes of the people of Scotland also need to be acknowledged. However, it is essential that it is fully recognised that the economic implications of an independent Scotland are different now from those in 2014, with the rest of the UK \u2013 our nearest neighbour and biggest trading partner \u2013 exiting the EU. The reaction from the EU to Britain\u2019s leave vote has been unequivocal \u2013 there is no going back. Not only that but they have told Britain to get a move on in invoking article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, which represents formal notification of the decision to leave. Jennifer Rankin and others write: The presidents of the European council, commission and parliament \u2013 Donald Tusk, Jean-Claude Juncker and Martin Schulz respectively \u2013 and Mark Rutte, the prime minister of the Netherlands, who holds the EU\u2019s rotating presidency, said any delay to Britain\u2019s exit would \u201cunnecessarily prolong uncertainty\u201d. After emergency talks in Brussels, the four said they regretted, but respected Britain\u2019s decision. \u201cThis is an unprecedented situation, but we are united in our response,\u201d they said in a joint statement. While the UK \u2013 the first sovereign country to vote to leave \u2013 would remain a member until exit negotiations were concluded, they said, Europe expected it to \u201cgive effect to this decision ... as soon as possible\u201d by triggering article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, which is in effect Britain\u2019s formal letter of resignation. The special settlement negotiated by David Cameron earlier this year was void and could not be renegotiated, they said. This would appear to dash the hopes of Boris Johnson and others in the leave camp who have suggested there is no rush for Brexit. For Jim Plows, in Clacton, Essex, the news of Brexit this morning triggered \u201cpanic stations\u201d. Despite voting to leave Europe, the 77-year-old said he was surprised by the news. His wife, Pam, said her first thoughts as the results came in was: \u201cOh dear.\u201d The retired couple from Jaywick, in Essex, were among several visitors to Clacton pier to say they were concerned about the process for Britain leaving the EU. \u201cThe next year will be a worry,\u201d said Jim Plows. Pam Plows said: We do have to put our country first. It\u2019s got to the point where there\u2019s been flooding here over the last few days, and there\u2019s no help, and then we\u2019re sending millions to other countries. Diane Claringbold, 51, said she was pleased about the result: I\u2019m glad that we\u2019re out. This country needs to start looking after its own people and not everyone else\u2019s, people like the Chelsea pensioners and the homeless.\u201d Claringbold, who is disabled, said that she voted leave because of pressures on the NHS. \u201cI\u2019ve waited eight months for an appointment at Colchester hospital. Other countries are fine outside Europe, we\u2019ll be fine too.\u201d Labour has responded to the motion of no confidence by two MPs against Jeremy Corbyn: Labour MP Margaret Hodge has explained why she has proposed a no-confidence motion against the party leader, Jeremy Corbyn. She told ITV News his performance during the referendum campaign was not good enough: He came out of the stable too late ... he was half-hearted ... We are about to enter into the most tumultuous period of our lifetime. We need someone who has demonstrated leadership qualities. Hodge said most Labour voters did not know where the party stood on the EU, a criticism that was also made during the campaign. She said \u201cone of these, young, talented MPs\u201d will hopefully come forward to take Corbyn\u2019s place. There was some briefly stunned reaction when Nicola Sturgeon talked of \u201cclear common cause\u201d between Scotland and London when it came to staying within the EU. This did not, however, mark the start of some complex plan for somehow involving London also holding an independence referendum. She was referring instead to something also outlined by London\u2019s Labour mayor, Sadiq Khan \u2013 the desire of another place which voted firmly against Brexit to have an independent voice in the negotiations over how this happens. In a statement on the mayoral website Khan said it was \u201ccrucial\u201d for London that it remained part of the EU\u2019s single market, and that he would push the government to make sure this happened. \u201cIt is crucial that London has a voice at the table during those renegotiations, alongside Scotland and Northern Ireland,\u201d he said. It is understood that what this means in practice will be a demand for the capital to have actual representation in Brussels during any negotiations over departure, when this happens, whether in the form of Khan himself or officials from City Hall. Khan\u2019s official had been in touch with Sturgeon\u2019s team to present a unified front on this ambition. London voted 60% in favour of remaining in the EU, although within this there were significant splits between boroughs, with inner London notably more pro-EU than the outer suburbs. For example, Lambeth recorded a 78.6% vote in favour or remain, while in Barking and Dagenham this was just 37.6% Immigration was one of the key issues cited by voters during the referendum and a primary focus for the leave campaign. However, the Guardian\u2019s home affairs editor, Alan Travis, writes that the results indicate that those who experienced the highest levels of immigration are the least anxious about it: The highest levels of remain voters were actually in areas of highest net migration while some of the strongest leave areas have had the fewest recent new migrants. London, which absorbed 133,000 of the 330,000 net migration in 2015, voted the most strongly for remain. Manchester also voted for remain \u2013 and with net migration of 13,554 had nearly double the level of net migration seen in Birmingham, which voted leave. The pattern is starkest at the local authority level. Lambeth in London, which recorded the highest remain vote of 78%, saw a net influx of 4,598, while Castle Point in Essex, which includes Canvey Island, saw a net inflow of only 81 new international migrants in 2015, but 72% of people there voted leave. The pattern was repeated in Conservative Wandsworth in London, where net migration was 6,295 and 75% voted remain, and Labour Hartlepool, where there was a net increase of only 113 in new migrants but 69% voted to leave. He does go on to point out that there are variations to this pattern. NHS England leaders have moved to reassure EU staff working in the service. The NHS relies heavily on foreign nationals. In 2014, the Guardian revealed that 11% of all staff for whom data was available and who worked for the NHS and in community health services in England were not British (rising to 26% for doctors, not including GPs). NHS England medical director, Bruce Keogh, said of European staff: It is important we make them feel welcome. NHS Employers chief executive Danny Mortimer told HSJ: Leaders across the NHS need to let the EU nationals in their teams know how valued this contribution will continue to be. Good afternoon, this is a continuation of our live coverage of reaction to the momentous decision taken by Britain to leave the European Union. You can read the previous live blog here. Here is a summary of the key developments: David Cameron has resigned after Britain took the decision to ditch the EU with the leave campaign prevailing 52% to 48% after a bitter contest. Cameron said a new prime minister should be in place by the start of the Conservative party conference in October. He said his successor should decide when to trigger article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, which begins the two-year process of negotiating a new trade relationship with the UK\u2019s former partners. Jeremy Corbyn faces a no confidence motion in his leadership, from two of his MPs. Margaret Hodge and Ann Coffey have sent a letter to John Cryer, chair of the Parliamentary Labour party. If the motion is accepted it will be discussed by the party\u2019s MPs on Tuesday. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has said a second independence referendum is \u201chighly likely\u201d. She wants to explore all options to stay in the EU and said the mayor of London Sadiq Khan shares common cause with her. The win for leave wreaked havoc on the markets. Shares plunged and the pound plummeted to a 31-year low as panicked traders reacted to the prospect of recession amid months of market turmoil. The FTSE 100 tumbled 530 points, or 8.4%, within the first few minutes of trading. That mirrored sharp losses for the pound overnight as investors sold sterling on the back of growing worries about the UK\u2019s economic outlook. The markets steadied a little after the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, declared that the Bank would not hesitate to intervene to instil stability. The president of the EU commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said there will be no re-negotiation of Britain\u2019s membership of the EU. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said the EU\u2019s 27 remaining members will meet to assess its future next week without Britain. Donald Trump who is visiting his golf courses in Scotland hailed the leave victory as a \u201cgreat thing\u201d that the people of the UK have \u201ctaken back their country\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
