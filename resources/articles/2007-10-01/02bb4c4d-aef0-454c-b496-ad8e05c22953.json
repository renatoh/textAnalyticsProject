In a Karachi mortuary last week it was a faith articulated by Rustam, a poor Sindhi farmer, who choked back tears as he searched for the body of his slain brother. 'If we have to, I will sacrifice 10 more brothers,' he said. Last week the growing political cult of Benazir Bhutto was cemented in the most terrible way, amid bomb blasts and bloodshed, during a rapturous return to Pakistan, the country from which she was exiled. Suddenly a persecution which seemed soft and unshaped during her years of exile has been given a hard edge by events. 'What I really need to ask myself,' Bhutto told the BBC in the wake of the explosion which killed 138 of her supporters, 'is, do I give up, do I let the militants determine the agenda?' She has decided to fight the parliamentary elections due in mid-January. It is a long way from the Benazir Bhutto in exile in Dubai. It was 2005, six years after she fled Pakistan, clouded by corruption charges. She was stranded in the desert metropolis in a large suburban house decorated with Arabic furniture and European paintings. Life was bearable, she said. She spent time with her teenage children. She travelled to Europe and the United States to give talks. She was kept busy holding her Pakistan People's Party (PPP) together by email and phone. 'I'm being persecuted because I stand for democracy,' she sighed then. 'We want internal change to come peacefully and politically. I don't think that is always appreciated by General [Pervez] Musharraf.' She wanted to come home. Last week Bhutto touched down at Karachi airport on a commercial flight from Dubai, surrounded by ballyhooing supporters and a frenzied media. Ten hours later a spectacular suicide fireball nearly wiped out her party leadership and plunged the fragile nation into a fresh crisis. Out of that fireball a defiant new Bhutto was born. She has put on ice plans to go to Larkana, a town 150 miles north-east of Karachi, to pray at the tomb of her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan's first popularly elected Prime Minister, who was executed after a military coup three decades ago. Late yesterday police announced they had arrested three people in connection with a vehicle from which a grenade was thrown at Bhutto's convoy just before the suicide bombing. The men were picked up in southern Punjab, a hotbed of Islamist militancy. Police released a photograph of the severed head of the suspected bomber - an unshaven man in his 20s with curly hair and green eyes - and scanned a database of national identity cards for clues. Newspapers warned of dark days ahead. If anyone doubted the danger posed by religious extremists, an editorial in The News declared, 'then perhaps their eyes will open now.' Last week's carnage dramatically opens a new chapter in the extraordinary career of Pakistan's greatest political survivor. Thirty years ago Bhutto, a 24-year-old university graduate, was thrust into the fray after her father was overthrown by a power-hungry military general, Zia ul-Haq. Two years later her father was hanged and Benazir spent another four in detention or jail. She suffered from dysentery, malaria, boils and sores during a stay in baking-hot Sukkur jail, according to her memoirs, Daughter of the East. When her hair started to fall out, she dreamed of eating steak and mushrooms in Oxford or peppermint-stick ice-cream from America. Now Bhutto is pressing for a third term as Prime Minister, most likely through a deal with another khaki-clad ruler, Musharraf. America and Britain are quietly egging them on. If the triumphant procession through Karachi demonstrated one thing, it is that the Bhutto political magic has not been extinguished. Ecstatic supporters clogged the streets and hung from trees to get a glimpse of their newly returned leader - a stark contrast with the rent-a-crowd rallies for Musharraf, where dour-faced supporters are excited only by the prospect of a free meal. As the throng pressed against her truck-mounted platform - emblazoned with pictures of herself and her father - dozens of young followers wearing white T-shirts formed a human chain around the vehicle, vigorously shoving the crowd from their path. A bulletproof platform had been erected on the roof. But Bhutto ignored it, squeezing between party bigwigs at the front of the platform. 'This is the moderate middle that doesn't want extremism,' she told The Observer, gesturing to the heaving throng. 'They want peace so there can be security and the government can address issues like education and employment. 'The militants have risen in power. But I know who these people are, I know the forces behind them, and I have written to General Musharraf about this.' The attack came around midnight, ripping limbs from bodies and flinging charred bodies across the road. Bhutto missed it because she had gone downstairs 10 minutes earlier, complaining of swollen feet. Pictures taken as she emerged, with security guards frantically pushing her into a bulletproof police van, show her eyes glinting with fear. 'There was blood and gore all over our clothes and the streets were littered with dead bodies,' she said. The brunt of the blast was borne by a police van and her security guards. At least 50 were killed 'We owe our lives to those boys,' she said. A deal with President Musharraf now looks more likely. She brings popularity. He provides a known quantity within the military that Bhutto feels she can deal with. But sinister forces may have other ideas. A Taliban commander who had threatened to kill her denies any involvement, but someone is out to get her. The next stop for Bhutto is to address the faithful in her hometown, Larkana. A peaceful meeting will give her the confidence she needs to continue to Punjab, Pakistan's most populous and politically significant province. But if the bombers strike again, the days of traditional politics in Pakistan may well be over. Pakistan: the key questions Who tried to killed Benazir Bhutto? The finger of blame has been pointed at various people by Bhutto, her husband Asif Ali Zardari and supporters. What is clear is that before her return two militant leaders - accusing her of being a 'slave of the US' - had threatened to kill her. Her husband blames those associated with the Musharraf government, while Bhutto has suggested associates of former president General Zia-ul-Haq, who hanged her father, were involved. What are the long-term implications? The most important is that state institutions, such as the army and intelligence services - whether they were involved or not - are unaccountable, underlining the fragility of the political system. It also emphasises the problems Pakistan has with Islamist militants, which it has failed to control. What does it mean for Bhutto? Despite the attack, her return showed she was the most popular Pakistani politician. The attack might further cement her position and further polarise politics. Or it might throw Musharraf and Bhutto together in the fight against extremism."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
