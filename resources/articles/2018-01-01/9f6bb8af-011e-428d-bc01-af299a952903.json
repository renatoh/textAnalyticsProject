Joshua, who puts his WBA, IBF and IBO belts on the line against Parker, wants to end the year as undisputed heavyweight champion \u2013 first by taking the New Zealander\u2019s WBO belt and then by defeating the WBC champion, Deontay Wilder, in what he hopes will be a compelling summer unification fight at Wembley Stadium. He warned his rivals he has improved significantly after revamping his training following his below-par showing against Carlos Takam in October. \u201cI am leaps and bounds ahead compared to the Klitschko and Takam fights,\u201d said Joshua, who pointed out his weight was already down to 17st 8lb, eight pounds lighter than against Takam. \u201cI\u2019m watching what I eat, running further and doing more than I did last year. Last week I did 20 rounds in the gym which I wasn\u2019t even doing for Klitschko, and we\u2019re still 11 weeks to the Parker fight. \u201cI think speed is in power,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen you\u2019re heavy and you try to club these durable fighters, it\u2019s not that simple just to go \u2018boom\u2019. Just because I\u2019m the most muscly man, it doesn\u2019t mean I can just hit someone and knock them out. It\u2019s the shot that you don\u2019t see coming that knocks you out. When I\u2019m quicker \u2013 bang, bang, bang \u2013 that\u2019s when I can knock my opponents down a lot easier.\u201d The 28-year-old had sharp words for Parker and his entourage, who he said had lied about him being put down in the gym and using performance-enhancing drugs to hype the fight and annoy him. \u201cThree times it\u2019s happened,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to use it as a PR stunt carry on using it as a PR stunt, but let\u2019s just talk about facts if you want to talk real. It gets under my skin. If he\u2019s better than me, quicker than me, tougher than me, it will take a lot to put me away because I won\u2019t stop coming.\u201d Joshua pointed out he was not only tested regularly by UK Anti-Doping but also paid extra to be on the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association testing programme before fights. \u201cI give them a slot and they can turn up anywhere, if I\u2019m on holiday, at a hotel, at a club,\u201d he said. \u201cI just text them and say I\u2019m going to be here. You have to let them know. I normally give them the time when I\u2019m going to be in the gym training for the opportunity.\u201d On one occasion the drug testers even accompanied him to Nando\u2019s in Sheffield. \u201cYou have to go through the piss test before they take your blood,\u201d Joshua explained. \u201cSo I said: \u2018Look, I haven\u2019t eaten, I\u2019m not going to sit here for an hour.\u2019 So they have to follow me, I got in my car. We went to eat at Nando's. They were patient. Then they followed me home.\u201d Meanwhile Joshua\u2019s promoter, Eddie Hearn, has told Wilder he must be realistic if he wants a unification fight against Joshua. \u201cWe were up for fighting Wilder now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s very easy to kill a fight. And you kill a fight by coming out with an unrealistic remark like: \u2018I won\u2019t take one per cent less than 50-50 or there\u2019s no fight.\u2019 We look at that and say: \u2018Mate go away, don\u2019t waste our time.\u2019 We would love Wilder to be next but he\u2019s got delusions of grandeur.\u201d Before that Joshua knows he will have to get past Parker \u2013 who clearly believes he can spring a huge upset. \u201cI played rugby union when I was at school for three years as a lock, as you can probably tell by my cauliflower ear,\u201d Parker said. \u201cI had thoughts of turning professional at rugby but my dad always told me to focus on one sport so I chose boxing. And it was the best decision ever.\u201d However, Joshua intends to make him eat those words \u2013 and plenty of others \u2013 on 31 March."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
