A report from the National Audit Office on the Farm Management Deposit Scheme shows that an expansion of the scheme, spearheaded by Joyce as minister in 2016, occurred despite none of the proposals having a \u201cstrong case for change\u201d. The auditor general, Grant Hehir, has also found that the FMD scheme, which held more than $6.6bn in deposits in June 2018, does not have \u201cfully effective\u201d administration processes, risk identification, or compliance measures in place. This is despite the amount of foregone revenue from the taxpayer-funded scheme more than doubling from $245m in 2016\u201317 to $500m in 2017\u201318. The report examines three changes to the scheme made by Joyce in 2016, which lifted the limit of deposits from $400,000 to $800,000, allowed early access to deposits and permitted using accounts to offset business loan repayments. The Department of Agriculture\u2019s records indicate the proposal to increase the deposit cap to $800,000 came from the minister for agriculture\u2019s office in April 2015. Prior to this, Treasury was preparing a budget costing for a deposit limit of $500,000. \u201cWhile the advice noted that increasing the deposit limit to $800,000 would assist primary producers to \u2018better manage\u2019 fluctuations in cash flows, it did not include any specific reasons why it was appropriate to double the size of the cap, or provide other deposit limit options for government to consider,\u201d the audit notes. \u201cThe advice noted that a deposit limit of $800,000 would likely benefit a small number of primary producers. No assessment was made as to how the higher limit would support the policy objective of increasing financial self-reliance.\u201d Hehir notes that take-up of the three policy measures have been low, particularly for the loan offset measure, and said \u201csound\u201d advice had been provided to the government that the changes would have a \u201climited\u201d impact on achieving the scheme\u2019s objectives. \u201cTreasury\u2019s advice to government was that none of the proposals provided a strong case for change. A common theme in the advice was that the proposals were likely to benefit a relatively small number of primary producers.\u201d He says the Department of Agriculture proposes to assess the impact of the 2016 policy changes through a broader evaluation of the FMD scheme within the next two years, and suggests the department also works with Treasury to improve its risk assessment and compliance processes. \u201cThe compliance arrangements and risk assessment processes have not fully captured key elements of the Scheme\u2019s design,\u201d Hehir says. Under the scheme, primary producers are able to defer \u2013 and potentially reduce \u2013 their income tax liability for money held in FMD accounts. The program, established by John Howard in 1999, is designed to allow producers to bank pre-tax income in good years, which they can then draw down in tougher times, such as drought. Surveys suggest that the average amount held in a FMD account is about $274,000 per farm, with an estimated 43% of FMD holdings owned by large farms with a turnover of between $1m and $5m. There are around 45,000 FMD holders participating in the scheme."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
