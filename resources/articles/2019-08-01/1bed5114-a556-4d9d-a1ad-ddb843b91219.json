Ties to be played in the week beginning 26 August: South section Plymouth v Reading Crawley v Norwich Newport v West Ham Oxford v Millwall Watford v Coventry Swansea v Cambridge Cardiff v Luton Bristol Rovers v Brighton Crystal Palace v Colchester Fulham v Southampton Bournemouth v Forest Green Southend v MK Dons QPR v Portsmouth North section Crewe v Aston Villa Lincoln v Everton Leeds v Stoke Sheff Utd v Blackburn Rotherham v Sheff Wed/Bury Newcastle v Leicester Burton v Morecambe Burnley v Sunderland Nottm Forest v Derby Grimsby v Macclesfield Preston v Hull Rochdale v Carlisle Meanwhile from the northern section, the following top-flight-focused fixtures were plucked from the hat: Crewe v Aston Villa Lincoln v Everton Sheffield United v Blackburn Newcastle United v Leicester Burnley v Sunderland There were six Premier League sides in the south section of the draw, and these are their games: Newport County v West Ham Watford v Coventry Bristol Rovers v Brighton Crystal Palace v Colchester Fulham v Southampton Bournemouth v Forest Green The Carabao Cup second round draw is about to happen! Jamie Jackson has filed his report from Salford: There is an epic shoot-out taking place in Copenhagen! And it\u2019s all over! Crvena Zvezda/Red Star Belgrade are through 7-6, after 11 penalties each! Also through after a shoot-out: Reading, after a 1-1 draw at Wycombe, Macclesfield, after a 2-2 draw with Blackpool, Mansfield, after a 2-2 draw with Morecambe, Cambridge United, after a 1-1 draw at Brentford, and Newport County, after a 2-2 draw at Gillingham. Some penalty shoot-out winners: Crewe, after a 2-2 draw with Middlesbrough, Forest Green, after a goalless draw at Charlton, QPR, after a 3-3 draw with Bristol City. George Tucudean, who scored Cluj\u2019s final goal in Glasgow, had a trial at Celtic when he was 15 and was taken to a game between Celtic and Barcelona. Now 28, he recently revealed that a heart defect may force him to retire. GOAL! Celtic 3-4 Cluj! George Tucudean has finished it! The final whistle has blown here, and Celtic are out of the Champions League! GOAL! Blackburn 3-2 Oldham! Joe Rothwell has scored in the 95th minute! Blackburn were 2-1 down in the second minute of stoppage time, and have won the game before the final whistle sounds! With Carabao Cup ties going straight to penalties if they are drawn after 90 minutes, there are about to be a lot of penalties to report on. I\u2019ll do my best. GOAL! Middlesbrough 2-2 Crewe! Crewe won the first half 2-0, with their second goal in the first minute of stoppage time. Middlesbrough are winning the second half 2-0, with their second goal in the first minute of stoppage time. Into stoppage time at Celtic, but there will be six minutes of it. Can they conjure another goal? Copenhagen and Red Star Belgrade have drawn 1-1, as they did in the first leg, and extra time didn\u2019t bring any further goals. That one will have to be decided by a penalty shoot-out. Final score: Ajax 3-2 PAOK! The Greeks didn\u2019t get another. Ajax win 5-4 on aggregate. GOAL! Ajax 3-2 PAOK! Diego Biseswar has scored in the 94th minute, his second of the game,but the Greeks still need another! GOAL! Swansea 2-1 Northampton! Swansea were a goal down in the 80th minute, and they\u2019re one up in the 83rd! GOAL! Celtic 3-3 Cluj! Billel Omrani again! That\u2019s three goals in six minutes, and there are 10 more to go. Celtic need to score another, or they\u2019re out. GOAL! Celtic 3-2 Cluj! Ryan Christie hands the advantage back to Celtic! There were less than two minutes between the goals in this ding-dong battle. GOAL! Celtic 2-2 Cluj! Billel Omrani has equalised from the spot for Cluj after Scott Brown handled in the area. Cluj are now ahead on away goals! Poor Bolton, 2-1 up in the 64th minute, are 3-2 down to Rochdale in the 66th. GOAL! Ajax 2-1 PAOK! Tagliafico has given last season\u2019s Champions League semi-finalists an aggregate lead over PAOK in the third qualifying round, with just 11 minutes to go. Cowabunga! Liam Walsh scores a brilliant dipping free kick from 35 yards to give Bristol CIty a 3-2 lead at QPR! That\u2019s a fabulous hit. A second penalty, and a second penalty miss, at Wimbledon. This time it\u2019s the home side fluffing their chance, Joe Pigott sidefooting unconvincingly to his right and the keeper going the right way and making a straightforward save. GOAL! Celtic 2-1 Cluj! The Scottish champions have turned this around, and lead 3-2 on aggregate! Edsonne Edouard has snaffled the second there. Bojan Bozovic has equalised for Sutjeska at Linfield. It\u2019s 2-2 there now, though the Northern Irish side lead 4-3 on aggregate. GOAL! Salford 0-3 Leeds United! From a Salford corner Leeds break, and Mateusz Klich curls in a cracker from the edge of the area! This game is very much in the bag now. David Kasumu has scored a lovely goal for MK Dons at Wimbledon, giving his side a 2-1 lead with a curler into the top corner from the edge of the area. GOAL! Celtic 1-1 Cluj! James Forrest has equalised for Celtic, and the tie is now completely level, 2-2 on aggregate! GOAL! Salford 0-2 Leeds! A corner is sent to the near post, where Gaetano Berardi flicks in a tidy volley! Slovan Bratislava are 2-0 up at Dundalk now, in first-half stoppage time, and lead 3-0 on aggregate. This really is revolutionary. An 18-year-old album being played in full, rather than a handful of recent Spotify phenomenons and something by Oasis. This changes everything. Ferencvaros came away from Zagreb with a creditable 1-1 draw in the first leg of their Champions League qualifier, and only needed to put in a decent performance in Budapest to earn a notable scalp and move to the playoff round. Instead they\u2019re 4-0 down, and with only seven minutes to play. Crewe have scored twice in four minutes late in the first half and now lead Middlesbrough, who made 10 changes for this game and appear to be playing like strangers, 2-0 And another debut goal, this from Hull\u2019s Ryan Tafazolli who has headed his team into a three-goal lead at Tranmere! GOAL! Salford 0-1 Leeds! Another debut goal, this from Arsenal loanee Eddie Nketia, who taps in after an excellent low cross from the right! Dynamo\u2019s dream has died: Lo\u00efs Openda has scored for Brugge in the 95th minute to make it 3-3 on the night, 4-3 to the Belgians on aggregate, and it\u2019s surely all over. And as I type that, the referee blows his whistle and it is literally all over. Brandon Mechele has scored a 93rd-minute own goal to give Dynamo Kyiv a lifeline in the Champions League! Club Brugge are 3-2 down on the night but it\u2019s 3-3 on aggregate; the Ukrainians still need another goal to go through! There is a proper shock on in the Champions League, with Krasnodar now 2-0 up at Porto and now 2-1 up on aggregate. They\u2019ve scored with their first two shots; Porto have had twice as many, but converted none of them. Billel Omrani has put Cluj a goal up at Celtic Park, with the Romanian side now 2-1 up on aggregate. Dusan Tadic has equalised from the spot to make it Ajax 1-1 PAOK. It\u2019s 3-3 on aggregate, with the Dutch side ahead on away goals. Linfield lead 2-1 in the Europa League, and 4-2 on aggregate, over Sutjeska. In Ireland meanwhile Dundalk trail 1-0 to Slovan Bratislava, who are now 2-0 up on aggregate with an away goal to boot. Charlie Austin has scored nine minutes into his debut for West Bromwich Albion, nodding in from about an inch after Grady Diangana\u2019s shot from distance was pushed onto the bar. West Brom lead Millwall 1-0. Dynamo Kyiv lead Club Brugge 2-1 with seven minutes of their Champions League qualifier to go, but it\u2019s 2-2 on aggregate, which puts the Belgians at an aggregate advantage, and they also now have a numerical advantage, Mykyta Burda having just been shown a second yellow card. QPR and Bristol City are drawing, having each scored in the space of two minutes. Nahki Wells\u2019 equaliser for Rangers was particularly smart, struck first-time from outside the area and surprising the goalkeeper, who didn\u2019t move. MK Dons have equalised against Wimbledon, Conor McGrandles making amends for his penalty miss with some nifty footwork in the penalty area followed by a precise left-foot finish. Blackburn\u2019s 11 changes haven\u2019t worked as well as Hull\u2019s - Gevaro Nepomuceno has giveen Oldham a 1-0 lead there. In the Europa League, Linfield took an early lead against Sutjeska and have since been pulled back - it\u2019s 1-1 in the 16th minute, with Linfield 3-2 ahead on aggregate. Ajax are losing 1-0 at home to PAOK in the Champions League and as it stands are on their way out of the competition, the Greek side leading 3-2 on aggregate. I think Nathan Collins was probably offside when he headed in Stoke\u2019s first goal at Wigan, from an inch in front of the line and a foot behind the goalkeeper, but it counts, and they\u2019re 0-1 up. Extra-tough luck for MK Dons: they\u2019re now losing, Scott Wagstaff volleying in a corner. Hull are two up now, David Milinkovic turning in the rebound after his own shot is saved, and they appear to be making muffins of this potential banana skin. Tough luck for MK Dons, who put the ball in the AFC Wimbledon net but the referee had already pointed to the spot for a penalty. That\u2019s one to keep for future refereeing courses, as how not to play advantage. Or how not to not play advantage. Anyway, a poor decision. And so was the decision to let Conor McGrandles take it, as he thrashed it over the bar! Rotherham have raced into a 2-0 lead at Shrewsbury, with only three minutes played. Kyle Vassell with the second goal there. Rosenborg are 3-1 up against Maribor, a repeat of the scoreline from the first leg, with the game in stoppage time. A 6-2 aggregate victory will be wrapped up at any moment. Hull City\u2019s all-changed line-up hasn\u2019t held them back: they\u2019re already winning! The clock strikes 7.45pm, if such a thing is possible, and most of tonight\u2019s Carabao Cup matches are under way! Also making 11 changes tonight: Derby, Hull and Swansea. Possibly more that I haven\u2019t spotted. Last time MK Dons visited Wimbledon, the hosts referred to them on the scoreboard and in the programme only as MK, which landed them in hot water with the EFL. So tonight there will be no match programme at all. Apoel have indeed won 2-0, so they\u2019re through to the Champions League knockout round. Elsewhere, Rosenborg have taken a 2-1 lead over Maribor. Their aggregate advantage is 5-2, which with 25 minutes to play should be more than enough. The first result of the evening is just five minutes away, unless Qarabag score and take it to extra time: Apoel have come back from a 2-1 first-leg deficit to lead 2-0 on the night and 3-2 on aggregate. The other four Champions League games already ongoing are being drawn. Blackburn are winning the Carabao Cup team changeathon, with the full house of 11 changes. Team news is flooding in. There are a few too many games for me to feature them all, but do let me know if you\u2019ve got any requests. Until then, here\u2019s Celtic\u2019s line-up: It\u2019s a bumper evening of Uefa-endorsed, Carabao-flavoured action and no mistake. There are no less than 33 Carabao Cup fixtures, unless I\u2019ve miscounted in which there might be less than 33 fixtures, with stand-out ties including the alphabetically first, between AFC Wimbledon and those nefarious history-thieves the MK Dons, and Leeds\u2019 trip to Mancunian upstarts Salford. Plus there are Champions League and Europa League qualifiers to sprinkle a little stardust over proceedings. Here, then, is a complete list of tonight\u2019s fixtures (except for those that are already finished; all 7.45pm BST kick-offs except for the ones that say otherwise): Champions League third qualifying round, second leg Ajax v PAOK (7.30pm; 2-2 in the first leg) Celtic v CFR Cluj (1-1 in the first leg) Dynamo Kiev v Club Brugge (6.30; Brugge lead 1-0 after the first leg) Copenhagen v Red Star Belgrade (7pm; 1-1 in the first leg) Porto v Krasnodar (8pm; Porto lead 1-0) Rosenborg v Maribor (6pm; Rosenborg lead 3-1) Ferencvaros v Dinamo Zagreb (7pm; 1-1 in the first leg) LASK Linz v Basel (7.30; Lask lead 2-1 from the first leg) Olympiakos v Istanbul Basaksehir (7.30; Olympiakos won the first leg 1-0)) Europa League third qualifying round, second leg Dundalk v Slovan Bratislava (8pm; Dundalk trail 0-1) Linfield v Sutjeska (Linfield lead 2-1) Carabao Cup first round AFC Wimbledon v Milton Keynes Dons Accrington Stanley v Sunderland Barnsley v Carlisle Blackburn v Oldham Blackpool v Macclesfield Bradford v Preston North End Brentford v Cambridge Utd Bristol Rovers v Cheltenham Charlton v Forest Green Colchester v Swindon Coventry v Exeter Gillingham v Newport County Grimsby v Doncaster Huddersfield v Lincoln City Luton v Ipswich Mansfield v Morecambe Middlesbrough v Crewe Nottm Forest v Fleetwood Town Oxford Utd v Peterborough Plymouth v Leyton Orient Port Vale v Burton Albion QPR v Bristol City Rochdale v Bolton Salford City v Leeds Scunthorpe v Derby Shrewsbury v Rotherham Stevenage v Southend Swansea v Northampton Tranmere v Hull Walsall v Crawley Town West Brom v Millwall (8pm) Wigan v Stoke Wycombe v Reading While I\u2019m publishing enormous lists, the draw for the second round of the Carabao Cup, featuring 13 Premier League clubs, will take place following the conclusion of the Salford game.
