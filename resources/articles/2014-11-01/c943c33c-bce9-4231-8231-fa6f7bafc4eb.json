Strike! Strike!\u201d that allegedly had New Yorkers pouring out of the theatre in 1935 in a revolutionary mood. Although this musical version of a popular 2010 movie ends with a similarly rousing injunction to \u201cStand Up! Stand Up!\u201d for women\u2019s rights, it sounds more like a way of ensuring a climactic ovation than encouraging us to take affirmative action. The story remains much the same as the movie: the inspirational account of 187 women who stitched seat covers for Ford cars in Dagenham and, in 1968, in defiance of their union, struck for equal pay. In particular, it charts how one of the machinists, Rita O\u2019Grady, discovers her own voice in speaking up for her supportive colleagues. But, turned into a big, brassy musical, the show has mislaid the quality that made the film so good: a real heart. Even in the film, there was a faint touch, as Peter Bradshaw noted at the time, of the Carry Ons; and it is that element that has been heightened in the musical. Everyone in Richard Bean\u2019s book seems to speak from the same gag-book. Beryl, one of the machinists, announces early on: \u201cI had seven happy years with my husband \u2013 and seven out of 25 isn\u2019t bad.\u201d In essence, she sounds little different from Harold Wilson who, on meeting the strike leaders, implausibly launches into a stream of sexist gags on the lines of \u201cWestminster is a boys\u2019 club \u2013 the ladies\u2019 loos are in Clapham.\u201d That note of relentless jokiness carries over into Richard Thomas\u2019s lyrics. Almost every line seems straining for a laugh so that, in the title song, we are inexplicably told \u201ccome get your cat spayed in Dagenham\u201d. And it is typical of the show\u2019s tendency towards caricature that the troubleshooter who arrives from Ford\u2019s head office is turned into a grotesque, stetsoned gunslinger who claims Dagenham part of America and who chauvinistically announces \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for us, you\u2019d all be speaking German\u201d. By crudely mocking the managerial top brass, the show diminishes the women\u2019s victory. Much as I admire Gemma Arterton, she also radiates such allure as Rita that you never feel the character is undergoing a spectacular transformation from humdrum machinist to instinctive leader. But I blame the book, and Rupert Goold\u2019s direction, rather than Arterton for the fact that one of the key moments in the story passes almost unnoticed. When Rita\u2019s husband protests that he never abused her or carried on with other women as if that were a signal virtue, she cries: \u201cThat is as it should be!\u201d In the movie, it felt as if Rita were speaking up for women everywhere: here the line simply slides by. There are things to enjoy in the show. Bunny Christie\u2019s design makes good use of the Ford plant\u2019s industrial machinery. Isla Blair as a dedicated shop steward, Sophie-Louise Dann as Barbara Castle and David Cardy as a trimming union man all give good performances. But, if I have left until last David Arnold\u2019s score, it is because it rarely rises above the functional and, like the show itself, strikes a feminist posture but lacks genuine passion. \u2022 Until 28 March.
