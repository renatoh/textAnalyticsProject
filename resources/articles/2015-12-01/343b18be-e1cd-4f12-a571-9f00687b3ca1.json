A grand jury declined to indict officer Timothy Loehmann, who opened fire on Tamir less than two seconds after arriving at a park where the 12-year-old was playing with a toy gun on 22 November 2014. Loehmann\u2019s partner, Frank Garmback, will also face no charges, the Cuyahoga county prosecutor, Timothy McGinty, announced at a press conference. McGinty argued that Tamir\u2019s death was caused by a \u201cperfect storm of human error, mistakes and miscommunications by all involved that day\u201d but there was no evidence of criminal misconduct by police. The two officers believed they were responding to a \u201cpotential active shooter situation\u201d and had not been provided with crucial details of a 911 call reporting that Rice was probably a juvenile with a gun that was \u201cprobably fake\u201d, McGinty said. \u201cHad the officers been aware of these qualifiers, the training officer who was driving might have approached the scene with less urgency; lives may not have been put at stake,\u201d McGinty said. Subodh Chandra, an attorney for Tamir\u2019s mother Samaria, said they had been given no information about the announcement beforehand and had learned it was taking place through a public statement made by the county prosecutor\u2019s office about an hour earlier. McGinty said he had spoken to Samaria Rice shortly before the decision was made public. \u201cIt was a tough conversation,\u201d McGinty said, adding \u201cshe was broken up\u201d. In a statement, Tamir\u2019s family said they were \u201csaddened and disappointed\u201d by the outcome, \u201cbut not surprised\u201d. \u201cIt has been clear for months now that Cuyahoga County prosecutor Timothy McGinty was abusing and manipulating the grand jury process to orchestrate a vote against indictment,\u201d the statement said. The family accused McGinty of mishandling the grand jury process, by hiring expert witnesses and allowing the officers to read prepared statements, which \u201ccompounded the grief of this family\u201d. Cleveland\u2019s mayor, Frank Jackson, said the city would now begin an administrative review process of the incident, and would not comment on whether the grand jury\u2019s decision not to charge the officers was an \u201cappropriate outcome\u201d. \u201cThis has caused the city of Cleveland \u2013 with the loss of a child at the hands of a police officer \u2013 to do a lot of soul searching so that an incident like this will never happen again,\u201d Jackson said. The Rice family filed an amended civil case against the city in January. Two months later the city responded by arguing in a defense filing that Tamir\u2019s own actions had \u201cdirectly and proximately\u201d caused his own death. The filing was followed by an apology from Jackson, who described the wording as \u201cvery insensitive\u201d. On Monday, McGinty argued that the civil lawsuit \u201cmay yet provide the Rice family with some of the accountability they deserve\u201d. Jackson also said the city would protect \u201ceveryone\u2019s right to express themselves if they disagree with the grand jury\u2019s decision. But your rights end when you do harm to people and property when expressing your opinion. Our position on that hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d Despite the expectation of protests on Monday, Cleveland remained relatively quiet on a freezing night. However, some people expressed their anger after the announcement. \u201cWe need to shut this city down,\u201d said activist Art McKoy at a gazebo set up at the park where Tamir Rice was shot. The picnic table inside the gazebo still held many stuffed animals and candles left behind by Rice family supporters during the past year. \u201cThe pastors and the politicians and the business leaders have all told us to keep quiet and we will get justice, but we can all see that that has not happened,\u201d said McKoy, \u201cWe need to shut this city down so we can show that [no-billing of the officers] is not acceptable.\u201d About 30 people met at the gazebo in the early evening hours to share prayers and support each other. Earlier in the day, a few protesters had blocked traffic for a few minutes in front of the park, but they moved on fairly quickly. \u201cIt is disappointing, but not surprising,\u201d said Khalid Samad, another activist gathered at the park. Samad runs Coalition for a Better Life, a non-profit organization that promotes peace within Cleveland neighborhoods. Sources in the prosecutor\u2019s office told the Guardian that local business and political leaders had asked for the grand jury announcement to come during Christmas vacation time to limit the size of crowds. The prosecutor\u2019s handling of the grand jury process, which began in October, has been heavily criticised by the Rice family and local activists, after the prosecutor proceeded to drip-feed evidence seen by the grand jury to the public, which included reports from experts concluding that the shooting was justified. Neither Loehmann nor Garmback appeared before the grand jury, and instead provided unsworn statements that were read to jurors earlier in the month. Loehmann claimed he shot because Tamir pulled the pellet gun from his waistband, \u201chad been threatening others with the weapon and had not obeyed our command to show us his hands\u201d. Tamir\u2019s family argued it would have been impossible for the officers to have issued commands given the fraction of time that elapsed before shots were fired. McGinty argued on Monday that a grainy enhanced CCTV image of the moment before Loehmann opened fire showed it was \u201cindisputable that Tamir was drawing his gun from his waist\u201d. McGinty said this single image was \u201cperhaps the most critical piece of evidence\u201d in the whole case. \u201cAt the point where they suddenly came together, both Tamir and the rookie officer were no doubt frightened.\u201d McGinty said. \u201cIf we put ourselves in the victim\u2019s shoes, as prosecutors and detectives try to do, it is likely that Tamir, whose size made him look much older and who had been warned that his pellet gun might get him into trouble that day, either intended to hand it over to the officers or show them it wasn\u2019t a real gun. \u201cBut there was no way for the officers to know that because they saw events rapidly unfolding in front of them from a very different perspective.\u201d The prosecutor pointed to a number of reforms that have been implemented in the county since Tamir\u2019s death, including an agreement between the federal government and the Cleveland police department to reform use of force and other major policy issues, and the roll-out of body cameras and dashboard cameras. He also called on the manufacturers of toy guns to modify their designs. \u201cIf the color and design of Tamir\u2019s pellet gun had screamed toy, then the call that set this tragedy into motion may have never happened,\u201d he said. McGinty left the press conference without answering questions from reporters. Samaria Rice had testified to the grand jury about the loss of her son. In a statement, her attorney said that she had asked the jurors whether the officers\u2019 actions \u201ccould possibly be \u2018reasonable\u2019 or \u2018justifiable\u2019\u201d. It said: \u201cShe believes that the answer is plainly no.\u201d Tamir\u2019s death in 2014 followed the high-profile police killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri and Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York, which sparked a new civil rights movement across the United States and calls for reform of US policing. Tamir\u2019s family renewed their call on Monday for the Department of Justice to conduct an investigation into the shooting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
