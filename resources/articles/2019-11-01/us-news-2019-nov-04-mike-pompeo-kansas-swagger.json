In the background, printed in pale blue like subliminal messages are a list of attributes, such as \u201cpatriotic\u201d, \u201cconfident\u201d, \u201crespected\u201d as well as \u201ccool vibe\u201d. In the state department right now the vibe is anything but cool, and Pompeo\u2019s dogged insistence on making \u201cswagger\u201d a catchphrase has become the punchline to a thousand wry jokes in Foggy Bottom. With foreign service officers being summoned daily to testify in the Ukraine impeachment hearings, while being denounced by the White House as \u201cradical unelected bureaucrats\u201d for doing so, and with the US being lambasted for deserting its Kurdish allies in Syria, Pompeo\u2019s staff have questions on why he is handing out \u201cswagger badges\u201d and why he is doing it in Kansas. He spent half of last week in his home state, attending events on \u201cworkplace development\u201d with Ivanka Trump. Pompeo suggested it was all part of being secretary of state, arguing that \u201cif we are not able to build hi-tech, innovative products, then my capacity to execute American diplomacy around the world will be diminished\u201d. To many \u2013 in Kansas and beyond \u2013 that looked like a stretch. The badges, glad-handing and posing with Ms Trump seemed more like someone lining up his next job, particularly as it coincides with one of the state\u2019s Republican senators stepping down. It was Pompeo\u2019s fourth visit to the midwestern state so far this year, and more than one in seven of the nearly 200 interviews he has given in 2019 have been to Kansas-based media outlets. It was also reported by the Wall Street Journal, that he took time in Wichita to meet Charles Koch, his longstanding sponsor and a kingmaker on the right of Republican party. Three of Pompeo\u2019s trips to Kansas have been official visits paid for by the state department, leading Democrats to file a complaint that he is violating federal laws prohibiting political activities while acting in an official capacity. Pompeo dismissed the complaint as \u201csilliness\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of left-coast, elitist liberalism that can\u2019t understand how someone would want to go to the amazing place like Kansas,\u201d Pompeo said on Friday in yet another interview with a Kansas-based radio station. If Pompeo is not running for the Senate, the Kansas City Star noted irritably, he had \u201cbetter things to do\u201d than to keep coming back. And if he did really want to run \u201cthen he should quit his rather important day job and do that\u201d. Pompeo\u2019s exit from the state department would be a dramatic development. Since the departure of James Mattis from the Pentagon and John Bolton from the National Security Council, he is the most powerful member of the cabinet, though his views can still be swept aside by an impetuous president. The secretary of state does not have to make up his mind whether to abandon ship for some time. Registration does not close for the Kansas Senate race until June next year, and he could arrive late in the Republican primary and still dominate. He has $1m in campaign funding left over from when he was a Kansas congressman, and he has Koch at his back along with other deep-pocketed donors. \u201cIf Pompeo comes in, it would be no contest,\u201d said David Kensinger, a Kansas Republican political consultant. \u201cHis affiliation with the president will only help him, and no Republican has lost a Senate race in Kansas since 1932.\u201d Burdett Loomis, professor emeritus in political science at the University of Kansas, argued that the longer the impeachment process, the Syrian fiasco and other Trump travails continue, the more they would weigh down a Pompeo Senate candidacy. \u201cFour or five months ago, he would simply be able to walk in here and big-foot his way into the nomination. Right now, I think it\u2019s somewhat less likely,\u201d Loomis said. \u201cEven though Kansas is a certainly Republican state or red state, it\u2019s never been one that has been wildly enthusiastic about Trump.\u201d Like Kensinger, Loomis did not think Pompeo had made a definite decision to run, but was keeping his options only. Russell Arben Fox, political science professor at Friends University said Pompeo was \u201ca very disciplined, methodical person, who doesn\u2019t do abrupt shifts\u201d. \u201cAs long as Trump doesn\u2019t fire him or throw him under the bus in the impeachment process, I don\u2019t think he would leave,\u201d Fox said. \u201cWhat is the advantage to him politically?\u201d Thomas Wright, the director of the Centre on the US and Europe at the Brookings Institution, suggested that the flirtation with a Kansas Senate run could even be a feint, designed to remind Trump he has other options, to help the secretary of state get his way in internal disputes. \u201cI remain doubtful that he wants to be in Congress again. I don\u2019t see why it is a better launching platform for a 2024 bid (better to be outside the Beltway),\u201d Wright said, predicting Pompeo would step down after next year\u2019s elections and go back into business. \u201cI suspect he may want the compensation that goes with the private sector.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
