Fraternise with free thinkers ranging from punk potter Carrie Reichardt to \"socialist magician\" Ian Saville, be inspired by the Empty Shops Network's use of reclaimed spaces, or spend cash with a conscience at The People Speak's \"democratic gameshow\", where the audience choose how to invest the evening's takings. Finally, get decentralised on the dancefloor at Cut A Shine's high-energy hoedown. Rich Mix, E1, Sat &amp; Sun Colette Bernhardt The Way Of The Dude, London At the box office The Big Lebowski was more of a slothful couch potato than a go-getting Gordon Gekko, but its legacy has been just as influential as the \"greed is good\" ethos of Wall Street, only with less shouting and more milk-based cocktails. Dudeism, a quasi-religion based upon the teachings of the film's antihero The Dude, has been the result of its slow-burn success and this event brings its founder Oliver Benjamin to the Idler magazine's west London slacker school for a debate on tenpin bowling, naps and kicking back. Tom Hodgkinson, John Naish and Ben Walters join Benjamin at the altar. The Idler Academy, W2, Wed Iain Aitch Relentless Boardmasters, Newquay Think surfing, think the Beach Boys. Think skateboarding, and it's a short leap to an internal jukebox loop of horrendous nu-metal. So a festival encompassing all of surf, skate and music is obviously a very good idea, and one which has evolved nicely since Boardmasters first emerged in 1983. This year's music bill takes in Wolf Gang, Eliza Doolittle, Bombay Bicycle Club and Fatboy Slim, but it's the awe-inspiring skills on show on the water \u2013 including the festival's first outing of longboarding \u2013 that will create the greatest stir.
