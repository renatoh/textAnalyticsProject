Although still second in the Championship, Newcastle are only four points ahead of third-placed Reading and, frequently struggling against a spirited QPR, they looked a team craving reinforcements. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed,\u201d said a clearly upset Ben\u00edtez in answer to questions about both a result which keeps them a point behind the leaders, Brighton, and the lack of transfer business. The latter seemed a cause of puzzlement. \u201cWe knew what we needed and, yes, I\u2019m surprised and, obviously, disappointed [we didn\u2019t get it],\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d Ashley has always relished a high-stakes gamble but Ben\u00edtez cannot have expected Newcastle\u2019s owner to risk quite so much by turning a deaf ear to his manager\u2019s warnings that further investment in the squad was imperative for automatic promotion to be assured. Instead Ashley \u2013 who refused to play hardball with Crystal Palace over the mooted signing of Andros Townsend before Tuesday\u2019s deadline \u2013 is reportedly irritated that Newcastle are not already cantering to a clearcut second-tier title after he allowed Ben\u00edtez to spend \u00a345m last summer. The former Real Madrid and Liverpool manager can, justifiably, point to a division now arguably more competitive than ever before, not to mention the \u00a375m he raised from player sales in the summer. As recently as autumn Ashley seemed positively starstruck by Steve McClaren\u2019s successor and his message to club staff was: \u201cWhat Rafa wants Rafa gets\u201d. With Newcastle already comfortably in the black, Ben\u00edtez believed he would be free to spend the \u00a330m summer trading profit during January and duly compiled a list of targets capable of not merely securing promotion but hitting the ground running in the Premier League next season. Some inquiries and negotiations did happen but February arrived with not a single new face. Instead of welcoming at least two players from a shopping list including Callum Wilson, Robert Snodgrass, Fabian Delph, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Tom Cleverley and Townsend, Ben\u00edtez was left contemplating the re-appearance of familiar fault lines as an unexpected power struggle began manifesting itself on Gallowgate. It was thought Graham Carr, the veteran, and previously powerful, chief scout who helped pioneer the club\u2019s flawed policy of signing only players aged 25 and under from more competitive foreign markets had been marginalised. In recent weeks, though, Carr has appeared by Ashley\u2019s side at matches and the pair apparently shared misgivings over the ages of some of Ben\u00edtez\u2019s transfer targets while debating whether he should be extracting more from the existing squad. The Spaniard, for his part, has become acutely aware his team are overly dependent on Jonjo Shelvey\u2019s extraordinary vision and passing range and the currently injured Dwight Gayle\u2019s goals. It does not help that Ashley and Ben\u00edtez rarely speak, instead communicating through Lee Charnley, the chief executive. If Ben\u00edtez is far too committed to his present personnel \u2013 let alone too much in love with the club and city \u2013 to have considered resigning now, he will never be short of suitors and, without some compromise, could easily walk out in the summer. By then, of course, a promoted, highly solvent and extremely well supported Newcastle would be ripe for a takeover \u2013 and the state of Qatar and Chinese consortiums are reported to be among those eyeing them \u2013 so everything could change. More immediately, the overriding priority is going up and Newcastle moved in the right direction when, in the opening minute, Shelvey pounced on a loose ball and directed a right-foot shot into the bottom corner. It proved a fragile lead as QPR, out to avenge September\u2019s 6-0 home thrashing by the Tynesiders, forced their hosts into some kamikaze defending and Ian Holloway\u2019s side deservedly equalised on the stroke of half-time when Conor Washington tapped in the fall-out from a corner. As choruses of \u201cRafa Ben\u00edtez,\u201d to the tune of La Bamba echoed round the ground Karl Darlow made an important save from Pawel Wszolek before Matt Ritchie headed Isaac Hayden\u2019s cross beyond Alex Smithies in the 54th minute. With Daryl Murphy tiring, a substitute was needed but, instead of Townsend stepping off the bench, Ben\u00edtez introduced Sammy Ameobi, newly returned from a loan stint at Bolton. Almost immediately Ameobi found himself knocked over and stood on by Joel Lynch, the defender driving his studs into the winger\u2019s back. He escaped unpunished but Newcastle felt even greater collective pain when Ciaran Clark headed that equalising 90th-minute goal into his own net. \u201cWe have to stick together,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez. \u201cI\u2019m confident we can win here against Derby on Saturday and everything will be fine.\u201d McClaren, Derby\u2019s manager and his Newcastle predecessor, may have different ideas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
