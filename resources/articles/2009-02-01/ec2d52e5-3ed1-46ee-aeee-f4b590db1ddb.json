Venter, who will take over from Eddie Jones at the end of this campaign, has held one-to-one meetings with the players and it is thought the former All Black forward Chris Jack and the club's leading points scorer, Glen Jackson, will be among those to depart. Census Johnston, the Samoa prop, is also understood to have been told he has no future at the club. Saracens said it would be \"completely inappropriate\" to comment on what they termed \"private meetings\" but they have already started working with players' agents and the Professional Rugby Players' Association to move several players on. The final number of departures could be as high as 18, from a squad of 38. \"He [Venter] wanted to explain his plans for next season, openly and honestly, and to end any uncertainty,\" the club said. \"Many of the players were enthused and excited by what they heard; inevitably some were disappointed. It would be completely inappropriate for the club to make any specific comment on these private meetings. Clearly every supporter will have their own view on who should play and who should not. \"Everybody has their own favourites. However, in any sporting organisation it can only be the view of the coach or director of rugby that counts. In the England rugby team that is Martin Johnson's view. In the Saracens team this season it is Eddie Jones's view. In the Saracens team for next season, it is Brendan Venter's view. There is no other way. \"Some will question why these decisions have been made in February and not at the end of the season. Other clubs may choose to adjust their squads in April or May. Our logic is that, by being open and honest in February, we afford the affected players a realistic chance of finding a new club. \"Selfishly the club could have waited until the end of the season but most clubs will have finalised their 2009-10 squads by then and, in all probability, the affected players would be left high and dry. The club is already working with the various players' agents and the PRA to assist in securing their futures and without exception the club will act decently and honestly. This has been a difficult week but the reality is that Saracens is not immune to the economic realities being faced by many companies across the country.\" Saracens lie seventh in the Premiership, 10 points out of the play-off places. Their best hope of silverware this season seemingly rests with the European Challenge Cup, having secured a home quarter-final against Newcastle in April. Venter's attempts to rebuild the squad could see recruitment from his homeland, South Africa. The flanker Schalk Burger and full-back Conrad Jantjes are among those to have been linked already with moves to the Premiership. Damian Hopley, the chief executive of the PRA, said of the clear-out: \"It's come as a massive blow to all the players involved and a huge blow to all of us in the industry.\" Saracens' squad includes the England captain, Steve Borthwick, the former Great Britain rugby league captain Andy Farrell and the former New Zealand Test scrum-half Justin Marshall. Under Jones they have developed some of English rugby's finest young talent, notably Alex Goode, Noah Cato, Adam Powell and Andy Saull."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
