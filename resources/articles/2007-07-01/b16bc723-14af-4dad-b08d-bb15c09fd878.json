The consortium, which was responsible for maintenance and renewal of two-thirds of the London Underground network, went into administration on Wednesday after failing to secure \u00a3550m extra cash from the taxpayer. Transport for London will now have to fund the work directly and it could lead to delays for some station refurbishments. The Tories want Parliament's financial watchdog to look at the public-private partnerships again following a critical report by the audit body last year on their cost to the taxpayer. Shadow transport secretary Theresa Villiers has written to the auditor general, Sir John Bourn, to call for an investigation into the operation of the PPP contracts. She said it should also cover Metronet's rival, Tube Lines, because of complaints from her constituents in Chipping Barnet about the running of the Northern and Piccadilly lines. \"The unfolding crisis at Metronet is a personal failure for Gordon Brown. He forced this flawed PPP on London in the teeth of strong opposition from the capital. He received many warnings at the time of the problems that the structure would involve, yet he disregarded them all, despite the fact that there were a range of other options that could have been considered. Now the chickens are really coming home to roost. \"During their first investigation of PPP, the NAO highlighted that nearly half a billion had been spent on consultancy fees. ... It is now vital that lessons are learned from the wind-up of Railtrack and that costs are not allowed to escalate as they did disastrously in that case.\" Metronet was one of two private companies contracted to maintain and renew the underground in a 30-year PPP plan that was bitterly opposed by the London mayor, Ken Livingstone. The consortium wanted London Underground to pay an extra \u00a3551m over the next year to cover some of its cost overruns, but Tube PPP arbiter Chris Bolt ruled this week that Metronet should receive only \u00a3121m. Metronet argued that LU had asked it to do more work than was specified in its contract and that LU should pick up the cost overrun. The demand for an inquiry by the Tories drew a wry comment from the unions. Bob Crow, general secretary of the RMT, said : \"This is a bit rich coming from the arch-privatisers who smashed our railways into a thousand pieces. I am sure that any audit will tell us what every Tube and public service worker already knows - that PPP and PFI projects fail to deliver services, but shovel huge sums of public money into a few private pockets.\" A spokesman for the NAO said yesterday that it was \"being kept abreast of developments at Metronet\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
