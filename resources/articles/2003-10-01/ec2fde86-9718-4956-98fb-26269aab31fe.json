Georgian rugby has a budget of just \u00a3400,000 and a coach who puts his hand in his pocket to buy much-needed equipment such as a video camera and computer. Darkest day: Missing out to Tonga in 1999 qualifiers. Won't let you forget: Beating arch-rivals Russia 17-13 to qualify for the finals and spark off a night to remember in Tbilisi. Svengali factor: Frenchman Claude Saurel has to utilise the budget of a second-division French rugby club in a country that lost around 500 players in the civil war five years ago. 'All of these men have seen combat,' he notes. 'Who knows, it might just be what we need to bring out the best in the team.' How do you beat them? A case of guarding against overconfidence and being ready for a fight. How do they beat you? Ilia Zedginidze has been named as captain and will travel despite an injury, though he may only play in the match against Uruguay on 28 October. He must rally a squad that is trying to forget about the withdrawal by their union of a promised \u00a380,000 for their European Nations Cup matches and World Cup warm-ups with Canada. Lost without: Makho Urjukashvili, who made his debut at 17 and is developing into a kicker to watch. Avoid in a dark alley: Guia Labadze is a tough flanker who combines darting runs with an ability to score tries. Loves nailing opposition half-backs. Words of wisdom: 'Logically we should expect to lose all our games and probably be beaten by 80 points in tach one,' says coach Saurel, launching the mind games. OSM prediction: Will not trouble the big three, but their match with Uruguay should be a good old-fashioned fight. The squad Backs: B Khamashuridze, M Urjukashvili, I Machkhaneli, B Khekhelashvili, A Kavtarashvili, T Zibzibadze, V Katsadze (acting captain), I Guiorgadze, G Khonelidze, O Eloshvili, P Jimsheladze, I Abuseridze, I Modebadze, M Kvirikashvili. Forwards: Z Mtchedlishvili, V Didebulidze, V Nadiradze, G Labadze, G Yachvili, G Chkhaidze, D Bolghasvili, G Tsiklauri, I Gundishvili, I Zedginidze."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
