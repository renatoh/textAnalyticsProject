Fife-based Russell saddles three, including the likely favourite in Green Flag, but it is Lie Forrit (3.50) that catches my eye at 20-1. Having made his name when trained in the Borders by Willy Amos, this 10-year-old joined Russell for this season and has recovered his form, winning handicap hurdles at Wetherby and, last time, at Kelso. What he can do over fences now is a fascinating question, as he has not tackled them in public for more than a year and has not yet proved he can run to the same level over the larger obstacles. But he has had only a handful of opportunities in handicap chases and it would be no surprise if Russell had improved this aspect of his game. The drying ground will help his jumping and he is the type who can lie handy, which has often been an advantage in this race. He is a few pounds out of the handicap but well treated on the pick of his hurdles form. Green Flag is easy to like, though he has more to prove in terms of stamina than Lie Forrit. Stamina will be no problem for the topweight, Tidal Bay, but it will take a mighty effort to give 21lb or more to all rivals and he could do with a softer surface. Roberto Goldback has dropped to a handy mark but it is not clear that he can run to his old form at the age of 12, while Roalco De Farges is another who would prefer more cut underfoot. Sam Winner, however, is the sort of useful but ploddy type who might be well suited by these conditions and Baile Anrai is another to consider for the places. 1.50 Newbury Last seen running third in the King Edward VII at Royal Ascot, his first defeat, Mustashaded can resume his upward curve and is preferred to Pether's Moon, who has not so far shown his best form on galloping tracks. 2.05 Ayr Alan King, who won the big race last year and was a winner on Friday's card, likes this meeting and his Valdez looks a cut above these, having lost his unbeaten record over fences only because he took part in the Arkle at the Cheltenham Festival. 2.20 Newbury An impressive winner of last year's Rockfel, Al Thakhira has much the best form on offer and her Breeders' Cup flop can be safely ignored. Joyeuse has bundles of talent but has yet to prove that she can settle down and behave like a professional. 2.40 Ayr Montbazon is feared but My Tent Or Yours should be up to the task of giving weight to these rivals. A first-time hood and earplugs may help him to settle but he stayed on remarkably well in the Champion Hurdle, despite running freely. Around this less testing circuit, he should be able to sustain an effort which will be hard to match. 2.55 Newbury Richard Hughes was raving about Night Of Thunder following his second success last year, in a Listed contest at Doncaster just a fortnight after his Goodwood debut. This is a smart colt but a trial like this, for which he is sure to be ready, might be his best opportunity of the year, since he is no certainty to cope with summer ground. Others in the field are unlikely to be as forward. Kingman's form does not quite match his reputation yet, while Astaire must prove he is more than a sprinter and Lat Hawill is stepping up from Newcastle maiden company. 3.15 Ayr Two miles on a flat track and drying ground look like suitable conditions for Manyriverstocross, who scrambled home at Ascot last time but had travelled well. He should prove the best in this field, though there is scope for Valco De Touzaine to improve on what he has shown so far. 3.30 Newbury A far-side draw should be no disadvantage on drying ground and Brownsea Brink should be sharper for a spin on the all-weather three weeks ago. The extra furlong on a straight course should show him to better advantage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
