There are more open-top cars sold in Britain than in Spain, France and Italy and last year, Britons bought 70,000 of the vehicles - only the Germans bought more. More second-hand convertibles change hands in Yorkshire and Scotland (where a car with a roof might seem more practical) than in the comparatively balmy West Country. One of the chief reasons that convertible car sales are growing is the arrival of the electrically opening roof, which means that when the weather changes, the rain can be kept at bay at the touch of a button. The figures have been compiled by the used car database Cardata, which said the demand for convertibles has encouraged new registrations to increase by 21% over the past year. Yesterday, the luxury car manufacturer Bentley announced it is to build a new convertible, capable of a top speed of 168mph, to go into production next year. The four-seater Arnage drophead coupe was unveiled at the Los Angeles auto show in California. It is powered by a 6.7 litre V8 engine and capable of accelerating from 0 to 60mph in 5.7 seconds. The data on used cars revealed a number of other anomalies. There are more 4x4 vehicles in London than anywhere else in the UK - a fifth of the country's rough-terrain vehicles are sold within the M25. New sales of 4x4s have increased by almost 12% in the last 12 months, with the Land Rover Discovery the most popular model. Andrew Sobell, Cardata's marketing manager, said: \"Naturally, where there are more motorists you would expect more vehicles to be up for sale. But a huge numbers of 4x4s were found to be on sale in city centres and urban areas, where they are unlikely to see mud or ever go off-road.\" Dr Franz-Josef Paefgen, chairman of Bentley, said they had developed the new convertible because of the success of its predecessor. \"We had such amazing success with the Bentley Azure, which has developed a cult following, although production stopped in 2003. There's no reason why this new Arnage derivative couldn't fill the gap left by the Azure. If customer demand is there, it could go into production within a very short space of time - as early as spring 2006.\" Last year, the luxury car manufacturer Rolls-Royce announced it was to build a convertible version of its \u00a3250,000 Phantom model."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
