The audience for ITV's live coverage of the Athens final on Wednesday peaked at 10.3m, with an average of 9.6m viewers tuning in for the full 90 minutes. Figures released yesterday showed that a further 1.2m viewers opted to follow the action with Sky Sports. The ratings were down on the last two years, when English teams also featured, and failed to top the audience for BBC1's coverage of the FA Cup Final on Saturday. The Wembley showpiece was watched by an average of 9.9m viewers, peaking at 11.5m. When Arsenal faced Barcelona in the Champions League final in Paris last year an average of 11.2m tuned in, and in 2005, when Liverpool staged their epic comeback against Milan in Istanbul, the audience averaged 10.8m. But the ITV director of news and sport, Mark Sharman, said he was pleased with the ratings for the competition overall, with the success of three English teams in reaching the semi-finals helping the network to its best average figures since the 2002-03 season. On average, 5.9m viewers tuned in to watch ITV's Champions League coverage, for which it shares live rights with Sky, peaking at 11.8m for the all-English semi-final between Liverpool and Chelsea at Anfield. And as audiences continue to decline for terrestrial channels, live football is seen as one of the most potent weapons that terrestrial broadcasters have in the battle to draw big audiences. \"It has been a fantastic season of Champions League football, culminating once again in a British team making it all the way to the final,\" said Sharman. \"The strong performances of games on both ITV1 and ITV4 are testament to the power of top-flight football to attract mass audiences.\" How the world saw it Corriere dello Sport Italy Eleven months after the World Cup, Italian football has taken the Champions League again thanks to an extraordinary Milan, through strength, character, quality, intelligence, personality Gazzetta dello Sport Italy It's pointless to dwell on the quality of the play, on the blackout of Kaka and Seedorf; Milan won their seventh Champions League and became the most victorious club [in terms of international titles] in the world As Spain Vengeance without football: in a final with little football, Ben\u00edtez won the tactical battle with Ancelotti but the Reds were unable to match their superiority with goals Marca Spain In Athens the tears were of joy for the Italians, monarchs of the old continent for the seventh time with football that was more pragmatic than beautiful L'Equipe France Milan in seventh heaven: the Reds had outplayed Milan before the opening of the scoring [but] the English team could not haul themselves back into it despite several moments of endeavour La Raz\u00f3n Argentina Although Liverpool played better, Milan were crowned champions.
