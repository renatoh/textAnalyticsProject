Adebayor is on Real's shortlist and the club's director general, Jorge Valdano, said: \"We are looking for a centre-forward who is prepared to lend us a hand for six months. We do not want to be tied to a contract for longer than that.\" That admission will be seen as a success for the coach, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, who has kept up sustained pressure on the club to sign a striker. Confirmation that Gonzalo Higua\u00edn will be out for at least four months, following an operation on his back, convinced the club's president, Florentino P\u00e9rez, who had been reluctant to bring in new players. Miroslav Klose's agent has claimed that Real have entered talks about signing the Germany international from Bayern Munich."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
