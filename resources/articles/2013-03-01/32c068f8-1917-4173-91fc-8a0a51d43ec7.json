In an interview with France Football magazine that follows several weeks of revelations about Qatar's victory in the race to host the 2022 World Cup Michael Garcia said he would deliver a preliminary report by 20 March, when the Fifa executive committee is due to meet next. \"I've got to look into the dismissal of the criminal investigation on Fifa, and make a report,\" he said. \"I've got to examine it like I would examine whatever else might raise the question: 'Have there been violations in the conduct of these people?' I've got to follow normal procedure and present this report to Judge Eckert, who's the president of the adjudication chamber; he'll read my report and take his decisions. \"I'll follow procedure, obviously informing the executive committee of what I'm doing. A timetable has been established. There's a meeting of the executive committee on 20 and 21 March. My goal is to have at least sent a preliminary report [between now and then]. There are many other matters under investigation, the one on the [votes for the 2018 and 2022] World Cup, which has been referred to me formally.\" A Swiss prosecutor said in a legal document released last year that Blatter's predecessor, Jo\u00e3o Havelange, and the former Fifa executive committee member Ricardo Teixeira took multimillion-dollar bribes on World Cup deals in the 1990s from the now defunct rights agency ISL. Blatter, whose own role in the ISL scandal has long been under scrutiny, has claimed he knew nothing about the bribes until after the company went bust in 2001. Garcia also called for evidence on the swirl of allegations surrounding the opaque bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, controversially won by Russia and Qatar. He called for witnesses to come forward and promised to protect their identities if necessary. \"The time has come for people who have information to come to me. I haven't got any preconceived ideas on what's happened or what's not happened. Well [I'm saying to them]: 'If you truly believe it, the moment has come to show yourself. There are things that we can do, under the parameters of the code, that will protect your anonymity.' I will work with them under this report. What wouldn't be \u2026 useful would be that under this wide-ranging inquiry that I'm leading, later, there are people in it who say, 'Well, they got the facts wrong', when they knew that beforehand,\" Garcia told France Football. \"You know something? Tell me! I'm working, working hard to uncover what's there or isn't there. [We've got] the framework, the channels through which people have got to come if they really think they have something to say. On whatever it might be! On whichever aspect of whichever question related to the World Cup. It is a message that has got to be heard. People have talked, written articles but what you have now is an official body which is in charge of this matter and it's important that people go see me to tell me what they've got [at their disposal].\" Garcia said it was \"too early to say\" whether he would be able to deliver any conclusions in time for the Fifa Congress, which begins on 31 May in Mauritius. But he vowed to make his conclusions public and said: \"I will pay attention to everything, to whatever current opinion might be, and I will examine all the information with the same impartiality, whether it comes from the US, from Qatar, from Russia, from Australia.\" Meanwhile the Fifa executive committee member Vernon Manilal Fernando, a one-time ally of the former Fifa presidential challenger Mohamed bin Hammam, has been banned from all football-related activity for 90 days. The Sri Lankan was banned to prevent \"interference\" while Garcia, the chairman of the investigatory chamber of the ethics committee, investigates a case believed to relate to the alleged misuse of funds by the Asian Football Confederation. Fernando accompanied Bin Hammam on his ill-fated trip to Trinidad while he was campaigning to replace Blatter as Fifa president, before pulling out when it was alleged Bin Hammam tried to bribe Caribbean delegates. Fifa subsequently dropped bribery charges after failing to find new evidence. Despite his initial ban being annulled by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, Bin Hammam resigned from all his football-related responsibilities in December after being charged with repeated violations while president of the AFC. He was again banned for life by Fifa. Blatter must convince a sceptical public that his \"roadmap to reform\", developed in the wake of the corruption allegations that reached crisis point ahead of the 2011 Congress when he was re-elected unopposed, will deliver meaningful steps to clean up the organisation. Despite promising to bring in new term limits for senior executives, Blatter has also hinted that he may renege on an earlier promise to step down in 2015."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
