The incident happened at around 10.40am in the driveway of Sir William Ramsey secondary school in High Wycombe. The 14-year-old girl was taken to Wycombe general hospital. Her injuries are not thought to be life-threatening. A second girl involved in the incident was left bruised and shaken. In a statement, the school said: \"An incident occurred in the school drive this morning, which involved a dispute between three pupils. \"Staff intervened very quickly but two pupils were hurt, one of whom was stabbed. The girl who was stabbed was taken to hospital and we believe that she is not in any danger. The other girl was shaken and bruised but well enough to go home with her father.\" The statement concluded: \"The school takes any incident of this sort very seriously and will investigate the circumstances fully. After this full investigation, the school will take appropriate action to ensure the continued safety of our pupils.\" The school said it would be writing to all parents about the stabbing, but its acting headteacher, Stephanie Gates, said classes were continuing this afternoon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
