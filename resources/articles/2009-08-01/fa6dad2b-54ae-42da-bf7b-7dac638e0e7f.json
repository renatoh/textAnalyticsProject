The explanation had better be a good one. Yates of the Yard is watching. But here's another question: is the noble lord worth saving for the nation? According to The Public Whip website, Lord Taylor (pictured) has an attendance record at the Lords of 17.9%. He has voted 243 times out of a potential 1,348. And how many speeches has he made? One. Just one in the past year. The tribal instinct says Dave must do what he can to save him, but if he rarely turns up, speaks or votes, why bother? If he fell on his sword, would we notice? Anger and not a little sadness among Green activists as Jim Killock, once the external communications co-ordinator on the party's national executive and candidate for party chair, is banished to the wilderness for five years. It's all a bit embarrassing. He is the executive director of the Open Rights Group and has much to say about defending the civil liberties of individuals on the internet. Yet the party believes he broke its rules by distributing the details of members to interested colleagues during the hotly contested referendum campaign as to whether the Greens should fall behind a leader. A tribunal was convened. Killock, whose membership lapsed last September, did not take up an offer to participate. In his absence, the regional council decided that there was a prima facie case and upheld it. No word from Jim, despite our calls. He can appeal, we are told, but his only reward would be a reconvened tribunal. Shades of Catch 22. Always possible, of course, that those whose details were passed around will now act against the party itself, and thus officials are keen to be seen taking a tough line against the unauthorised disclosure of data. Closing the stable doors a bit late perhaps, but closing them nonetheless. For we all have sinned. We all make mistakes. Some more grave than others. Jim Killock may in time be able to explain his situation to aggrieved Green party members, but how can the directors of a German Catholic bank explain how they ended up with shares in a contraception producer, a weapons firm and tobacco companies. \"We want to apologise to our customers that this mistake has happened,\" said Winfried Hinzen of the Cologne-based Pax Bank. That's a fair few Hail Marys. We should be worried for Gordon as he enjoys the summer diversion of voluntary work in his Scottish constituency. He has been under strain, and it shows. Now wonder he is looking peaky. No doubt he is fine overall, but if the limbs ache at the end of the day, who could blame him for thinking about the trip to Sellafield he undertook on January. As we reported at the time, his trip coincided with the discovery of a radioactive leak at the Cumbria plant. Following an investigation, we now know that the leak persisted for 14 months, but no one noticed. There was no risk to anyone, management there insists, but it cannot be anything other than concerning. If his aches turn out to be swine flu, that would probably come as a relief. Finally, we do indeed dispel a few myths during a brief visit yesterday to the Great British Beer Festival at Earls Court. There are a smattering of beards, it is true, and some gentlemen stout of physique \u2013 with T-shirts that ask: \"Is my belly big in this?\" But there are thin men too, and women milling around with never empty glasses: nothing to justify the beardism and stoutism of which the organisers so rightly despair. They are concerned about the loss of pubs and excessive government duties; and one solution, they say, would be for the man at the very top to appoint a minister for public houses. It's bold, innovative; the kind of thinking Lord Mandelson likes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
