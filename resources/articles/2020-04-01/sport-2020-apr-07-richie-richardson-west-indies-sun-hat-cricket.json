It\u2019s not that they\u2019re all that comforting, as such \u2013 not if you followed England, anyway \u2013 more they carry you back to a time when your biggest worries were wondering when Mike Atherton\u2019s back would give in, why the selectors insisted on making Alec Stewart keep wicket and whether Mark Ramprakash would ever make a Test century. Less the stress, this time around, of fretting. I was watching some the other day and there was Richie Richardson heaving Australia\u2019s attack all around the Bourda. Lord, did anyone ever hit the ball through the off like Richardson? He went for the ball as if he caught it stealing from him. That was in the early 1990s, when he was in his prime. Viv Richards was on the way down, Brian Lara on the way up, and Richardson was the one you wanted to watch. \u201cOne of my all-time favourite batsmen,\u201d says Mike Selvey, the Guardian\u2019s former cricket correspondent. \u201cOne of the few batsmen worth forking out money to see.\u201d The hat was part of it. Watching a man bat in a sun hat, the past never looked so much like another country. If you were going to tell the history of cricket in a handful of objects, Richardson\u2019s hat would be one of them, the maroon one, with the broad brim. If you can remember Richardson, you\u2019ll picture him wearing it. So it\u2019s almost surprising to find he ever went without it. But he did. For the first few years of his career he batted in a cap, just like his captain Richards. It was in the late 1980s, during a one-day tournament in India, that one of the sponsors sent the team a box of maroon sun hats they\u2019d made. \u201cIt didn\u2019t look good, everybody just chucked them away,\u201d Richardson said later. \u201cI kept one and decided I was going to try something.\u201d He asked the manufacturer to make him one with a wider brim and a deeper cup, so it would sit just right. Those were his best years: he took 122 and 106 off Australia in the winter of \u201988, 194 and 156 off India in \u201989, 104 and 182 off Australia in \u201991, 104 and 121 in England that summer, and made another 109 against Australia in 1992-93. He loved playing Australia, making nine hundreds against them ;at the time only Jack Hobbs had scored more. And he did it all in that sun hat. They started selling replicas outside his home ground, the Antigua Recreation Ground, where Chickie\u2019s disco would play his song. \u201cWho is dat man, flashin\u2019 blade in de han\u2019, Beatin\u2019 de ball like he playing pouchan, A livin\u2019 nightmare for the opposition, Richie Rich, Richie Rich, Richie Richardson.\u201d The hat became famous. In Australia The Late Show ran a skit about it. \u201cChannel 9 ran a Richie Richardson hat competition for the crowd and it was won by five blokes,\u201d Selvey recalled. \u201cOne who wore it and four who supported the brim on poles.\u201d When Richardson signed for Yorkshire, in 1993, the papers were full of stories about whether they\u2019d let him wear it. \u201cWe don\u2019t allow floppy sun hats,\u201d the club secretary said. \u201cOur chief executive, Chris Hassell, has said he will take Richardson on one side when he arrives and suggest that the hat is not appropriate.\u201d \u201cThe hat is part of me,\u201d Richardson said then, \u201cpart of my image.\u201d The hat, which offered no protection at all, was his armour. It wasn\u2019t that you couldn\u2019t hurt him. There\u2019s another clip of him being hit on the jaw by Asantha de Mel in a one-day game against Sri Lanka. Richardson turns his back, takes five strides off the pitch, flags for a medic and spits out blood and broken teeth. It was that he wasn\u2019t scared of being hurt. Richardson says helmets made him uncomfortable, \u201clike trying to fight against someone without room to manoeuvre \u2013 it made me vulnerable\u201d. Better, he reckoned, to trust his reflexes. The hat was a swagger and a symbol of proud defiance. Then, in March 1995, Australia went to the West Indies. It was hard cricket, maybe some of the hardest played. \u201cIt was strike or be struck down,\u201d reported Wisden, \u201cmore like arm wrestling, white knuckles tilted back and forth until the strain told, the weaker man snapped.\u201d Richardson was back as captain, after a year when he\u2019d missed a lot of cricket because he\u2019d been enduring mental fatigue. His mother had died and his son had been badly injured in a car crash. The captaincy was weighing heavy and his touch had gone. Australia won the first Test by 10 wickets in three days. Richardson made nought and 36. In the second, 25 years ago this week, Richardson was pushed up to open, at his home ground. That was where it happened. Late on the first day, for the first time in his life, Richardson walked out to bat in a Test wearing a helmet. He must have been one of the very last players to put one on. Selvey wrote: \u201cOne of the most charismatic cricketers has joined the responsible, lidded ranks of the anonymous.\u201d They say the crowd booed him as he walked in. The game was a draw. But West Indies lost the next and the series with it. It was their first defeat in 15 years and a watershed between two eras of the game, the one West Indian, the next Australian. Richardson played eight more Tests, then retired at 33. As for that hat, it\u2019s on a peg on his bedroom wall, a relic now, a symbol of something else: the way they used to play."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
