The year when bushfires, a global pandemic, the most divisive US election in living memory all plagued humanity. When black became white, upsidedown become rightwise, the previously unseen become the unremarkable, and birds generally flew backwards through the skies. Now, world Rugby fans can truly say they\u2019ve seen it all: an Australian win over New Zealand in the Bledisloe Cup. An inspired 80 minutes from an Australian side smarting from a record loss last week in Sydney. A game turned on its head several times through red cards, red cards, yellow cards, and more yellow cards. A game played at a frenetic tempo - with big aggression - big hits - and at times perhaps an absence of the kind of level-headed coolness that defines champion sides at the peak of their powers. The Wallabies debutants - as they didn\u2019t last week under the crucible of pressure - stood tall: Tom Wright, Lachie Stinton (for 34 memorable minutes). But key contributions from relative veterans like Marike Koroibete and Taniela Tupou helped spark the home side late on. New Zealand, shuffled the pack and blooded plenty of newer faces, but it must be said - largely from the bench, and they still put out a XV that should have been competitive against any team in world Rugby. It\u2019s a result that was ultimately meaningless for the Bledisloe Cup - that\u2019s already on a plane back to New Zealand for another year. But it\u2019s a result that breathes life into this year\u2019s Rugby Championship. And it\u2019s a result that gives a generation of new Wallabies a sense that if they play to their best - they can beat the best. A tremendous night\u2019s entertain in Queensland. The Wallabies emerge triumphant over the All Blacks! And here\u2019s our match report if you\u2019re just joining us (or inconceivably, fell asleep). What a humdinger: Plenty of chatter below-the-line: Well done, Wallabies - definitely deserved to win that. Played with more intensity and more intelligence than the All Blacks, who reverted to the poor performance typical of the past 3 years: undisciplined, and incoherent on attack. I think there will be plenty of very interested onlookers following this game from the northern hemisphere. Yes, the Wallabies looked back to something resembling an Australian Rugby union team, but yes - the All Blacks are starting to look like an outfit that doesn\u2019t always carry the aura of invincibility from the Richie McCaw / Dan Carter etc days. Beauden Barrett: \u201cIt felt like a bit of a dogfight out there. We probably weren\u2019t as composed as we should have been. In the past when there\u2019s a bit of niggle we normally rebound, but we got stuck in it.\u201d \u201cThey were certainly up for it tonight - they treat this place like a fortress, and for James Slipper\u2019s 100th - they were certainly up for it.\u201d We hear from Tom Wright - don\u2019t forget his first ever touch in a Wallabies jersey was to collect a flick pass from Tom Banks, step inside a would-be tackler, and place it over the tryline for a five-pointer - just two minutes in. He was also on the receiving end of that big-Ofa red card - a shoulder direct to the jaw - but it hasn\u2019t impaired his ability to chat post game. \u201cThis is the most exciting moment of my life\u201d - and who can blame him for showing a bit of delight. So - where was that one won and lost for you? Who were your standouts, who were your villains? And the $64,000 question for Australian Rugby supporters: how do the Wallabies learn to bottle this performance - and produce it in more than just fits and spurts? And you have to say. There\u2019s not a person in world rugby who doesn\u2019t want to hear John Farnham\u2019s \u201cYour the Voice\u201d booming round a gold-laden stadium up in Queensland. The crowd were fantastic tonight, and they really made their presence felt. Vocal, engaged - and you could feel the lift of energy throughout that game. A dejected Sam Cane speaks post-game, reflecting on a bit of crazy game in fairness. \u201cI think the Aussies played a little smarter, in fairness - we\u2019re bitterly disappointed, but well done the Wallabies.\u201d I wonder if he means thoughtless stuff like Scott Barrett\u2019s yellow card - a micro-moment that really put his side under pressure. And that\u2019s all she wrote! What a dramatic finish, to a game that in truth never let up for a single minute! The Wallabies have salvaged some pride, and some very young players can now enjoy their first ever win over New Zealand! The Bledisloe might be bound for New Zealand - but they\u2019ve bagged themselves five crucial Rugby Championship points tonight, the Wallabies. What. A. Match. 80 min: So New Zealand with about a minute to win this! Australia kick deep, and they look to close down the ABs danger men. And how\u2019s this work - and can you believe it! Marike Koroibete has put his body on the line once again; and pulled down first Damien McKenzie, and then Beauden Barrett! And he\u2019s earned the turnover for Australia! 79 min: \u201cThey think it\u2019s all over - it\u2019s never over against New Zealand\u201d!! Terrific solo work from Ardie Savea - he\u2019s not had his most impactful game, but he was huge there. Savea sets up the run, and it\u2019s the young replacement Vaa\u2019i who bundles over, and scores under the post! Jordie Barrett adds the extras. This is nail-biting stuff! 78 min: So - big few minutes here for the home side, if they\u2019re to hang onto this one. The All Blacks look to tap quickly and get things going - don\u2019t for a second think they\u2019re ready to give up, New Zealand. They earn the penalty, the All Blacks - and this is real danger time for Wallabies fans. 75 min: There\u2019s a man over the line - and who is it? Taniela Tupou! Well if ever anyone deserved a try, it was that terrific tryptic of aggressive running from the front rower! The leg movement, the power. He\u2019s over and he puts Australia clear! Reece Hodge adds the extras, and for the first time in what feels about a decade - there are smiles on the bench of the Australian staff! 74 min: Australia still with possession, and it\u2019s Tupou who batters through a tackle! Tupou again with metres - two hit ups inside a minute. The Wallabies within a few metres. Can they get somebody over? 73 min: Beauden Barrett with the one-on-one strip! How is that for a big-time play! Ned Hannigan the isolated runner. And they find an exit, New Zealand. 71 min: Penalty against New Zealand for a high shot on new scrum half Tate McDermott, on for White. Australia lineout 25m out - they go long over the top to Hooper who joins the line late. They look to build the phases, the Wallabies - big chance here! 70 min: No mistake from Hodge! That\u2019s a gimme from that range, and we\u2019re set for a massive last ten minutes. You often see games against the All Blacks go wrong from about 60 minutes as the depth of their bench shows through. A lot of young faces on the All Blacks bench tonight though. We\u2019re going to the wire. 69 min: Big chance here, Australia. Hooper elects to kick to the corner and chase the five points with the man advantage. They go close and the All Blacks try to pinch it - but illegally so, says ref Nick Berry. A shot at three points, from right in front for Reece Hodge. 68 min: And it was called back for a knock-on against Nic White, but the replays show Scott Barrett has knocked the ball out of his hand from an illegal position on the ground. We have a fourth card - it\u2019s ten minutes in the bin for the New Zealand second-rower! 66 min: Jordie Barrett flies high, but he doesn\u2019t claim - and who\u2019s there: Marike Koroibete first man on the scene for the regather. Australia on the attack, but the ABs defence is resolute. They turn it over and attempt the exit. Still with Australia around 30m out as new man Noah Lolesio looks to pin the ears. 65 min: He\u2019s got the distance.. but he\u2019s missed the accuracy! No points, and the All Blacks remain in front. 64 min: It\u2019s terrific work from Koroibete once again, as he joins Phillip to stand over the ball and earn the penalty! Hodge fancies this from 50m now. Well, when you\u2019ve got the weapon in the arsenal, why not try it. Will he have the legs to give Australia the lead? 63 min: The Wallabies look to bring it out from their own line, before Hodge booms one 50m clear. NZ play the quick lineout feed, but they almost duff it with poor handling! It goes backwards though. 61 min: Crucial touch-finder from Nic White; there\u2019s so little margin for error at this level. We saw TJ Perenara drop a kick for touch a metre short - that one was only there by a metre the other way. NZ with it just inside Australia\u2019s half - and they Test Tom Banks on the left edge with a clever kick from Beauden Barrett. 59 min: Straight as a dart, once again. He loves them from distance, does Reece (except that one after the hooter in Wellington, which we\u2019re obviously not going to mention). Three points, Australia - and we\u2019re back neck-and-neck! 58 min: And there\u2019s the scrum penalty! His teammates rush to congratulate Tupou - the man\u2019s an axe! Ably assisted by debutant Bell and the excellent BPA. (We\u2019ll try to get that acronym going; sure). And Hodge says - gimme a look at another three. 55 min: So, NZ set down the scrum, about 5m out from their own line. Can the fresh man Tupou launch something special here for the Wallabies? The ABs regather out the back as the scrum starts to wheel, and it\u2019s TJ Perenara who looks for touch - but doesn\u2019t quite find it! But it\u2019s a pass between two players from Australia and they bomb the chance! 54 min: Australia go to the bench. On comes Tongan Thor and Rob Simmons also earns an early sit down. Terrific toe from Tom Wright who motors down the right flank! He looks inside for support, but a diving Nic White can\u2019t regather the pass! Oh my - how close for the Wallabies - ball to ground just a few metres shy of the try line. 53 min: They set up the big driving maul, the ABs, and Australia back the wrong side. It\u2019s through the middle with the hooker with the hands on the pill. We saw a try to Dane Coles last week, and it\u2019s two-from-two for the NZ number twos! No mistake from Barrett, J, with the boot - extras added. 51 min: Terrific work from Koroibete! Only just back on the field, and he needs to push the pedal to the floor to run down a flying Sevu Reece. That\u2019s a battle made in Nadi, from the two Fijian-born flyers! And the ball trickles into touch, but it\u2019s adjudged off a gold hand last. We have a lineout feed for New Zealand, about 5m out. Big chance here. 50 min: As straight as an arrow! That\u2019s a lovely kick from Hodge, and the home fans cheer their delight. This is bubbling nicely - what a final thirty minutes we have in store here. 48 min: Penalty to Australia! Hodge says, yes we\u2019ll take the kick, and as they soak up a little more time, Koroibete eventually is able to rejoin the contest. We\u2019re back 14 v 14, and here\u2019s a chance for the Wallabies to re-take the lead. 46 min: Australia set for the scrum. Not in any hurry, mind. He has to be careful, Nic White - there\u2019s only so much \u201cbrinksmanship\u201d that most refs will put up with. And the scrum half eventually feeds and Australia retain and look to release their backs. 43 min: So, Australia look to built the sets - again, something we hardly saw last week. BB does well under the bomb, but it\u2019s a loose pass from Lomax that almost gifts the Wallabies a look at the try line. NZ continue with the ball - lovely run from R. Ioane - but there\u2019s a forward pass! That\u2019s two in a few minutes from the ABs; a real let-off for Australia with a man in the bin. Another insight from below-the-line: As a neutral, that first was an awesome watch! Both teams playing on the edge, very little kicking and high intensity. Much better then last week, hope they keep this up in the second half. And I think we can all agree on that point. I\u2019d like the 80 minutes from last weekend back, please. Not even as a fan of the Wallabies, but just Rugby in general. 40 min: But, no time to chew the fat - although I\u2019d still love to get into some of these talking points - because we\u2019re back, and we\u2019ve 28 players back out on the field - wait, 27 - and the ABs get us back underway! A reply from below-the-line: Koroibete\u2019s yellow was correct. A clear infringement on a warning. And they were lucky not to get another for again stopping the jumper landing at the subsequent lineout. I don\u2019t think either red card was correct. Both were yellow card offences, but at least the ref was consistent in his mistakes! And to your third point (re Nic White). Do you remember Nick Phipps? How quickly some forget.. Gail Campbell has written in: Apology from the Refs. Sorry All Blacks we\u2019ll send a Wallaby off and make it your favour again. Where was all the slow motion to see what actually happened as with the earlier tackle. Nothing like it. I\u2019m taking a wild stab and guessing, Wallabies fan, our Gail. But - we see it so often in world Rugby, football - many codes. The 75% decision followed by another 75% decision as a leveler; could there be some truth in the above? From a player welfare perspective, the rules are there to protect - and nobody can find fault with that. From a \u201cnatural justice\u201d / \u201cbushman\u2019s lawyer\u201d perspective, surely if Ofa goes, then you\u2019d be hard pressed not to send Swinton as well? So! Your thoughts on that first forty? I\u2019m off to shake my writing fingers out, grab a glass of water and attend the water closet. But when I get back - I want to hear: your thoughts on the key calls; your thoughts on the scoreline, whether it\u2019s a fair reflection; and your thoughts - in general - about what we\u2019ve just seen! 40 min: I\u2019ll let somebody else talk me through the intricacies of that infringement. It\u2019s one of my pet peeves in Rugby; the niggly, almost subjective penalties, that if on a team warning result in a man in the bin. Koroibete doesn\u2019t deserve that - he\u2019s been excellent so far tonight; but \u2018dems de breaks. And they withstand the attack do Australia, fine work from Wilson in the line out and that\u2019s all we have for the first half! What a pulsating, drama-filled forty minutes of rugby that was. 40 min: Cody Taylor drives to within millimetres of the line, before Koroibete collects Anton Lienert-Brown. Terrific defence! But wait a second. He\u2019s been penalised - and having just given a general warning to the Wallabies for repeat penalties, it\u2019s Koroibete who pays the price - yellow card! And it\u2019s injury to insult - the centurion Slipper has left the field with a suspected arm injury; which means a debut for young Angus Bell, who comes on to replace him. 38 min: We\u2019re only metres from the line as Sevu Reece bounces off a few would-be tacklers! Plenty of hard running, and hard hitting from both sides. We\u2019ve come back for an early hit on Savea in the lineout, and the All Blacks set up another lineout from the resulting penalty. 36 min: So some crucial championship minutes here for the Wallabies. They done well up to this point, but they could go in behind as Beauden Barrett lines up the banana kick to touch to set up a big offensive lineout. 34 min: Deary me. We\u2019ve got another TMO after a BIG hit from Lachie Swinton. He\u2019s lined up the veteran Sam Whitelock with a massive hit - no mitigation in body position says Nick Berry, and we\u2019re back to even numbers! It\u2019s a man-off-a-piece, and one of the most promising debuts you\u2019ll see, ends after just 34 minutes. He\u2019s been a wrecking ball, Lachie Swinton, but he got that one wrong. And he pays for it, in a big way! 32 min: And from under the pump at one end, to the other! They earn a shot at the sticks, and there\u2019s no mistake from Jordie Barrett from about 40m out. And after all that positive momentum for the Wallabies, they concede their lead. 31 min: So, with a man down it\u2019s the back Anton Lienert-Brown who joins the scrum as a back rower! Now we\u2019ve seen everything. A close up suggests he\u2019s not overly familiar with the role, himself. They\u2019re up against it, the ABs. But it\u2019s a huge interception from the skipper Cane who anticipates the ball out the back. Was he offside?! He certainly didn\u2019t appear to be bound. But credit the smart thinking. 30 min: Fun fact: all seven Australia-New Zealand Tests played at Lang Park have been decided by seven or less points. Have we got another cracker in store tonight? Early indications suggest so. 29 min: Some knock ons from both sides, a little bit loose - but credit both sides for looking to go on the attack. And here\u2019s that talking point moment from big Ofa: Red? Not red? I\u2019m open to persuasion as to both arguments, to be honest. 26 min: Smart work as ABs hold out, before TJ Perenara tries the quick tap and a fast counter-attack! Gotta love that character, down a man but still looking to take the contest to their hosts. White scurries to make the tackle. And good hands at the breakdown rebuffs another Wallabies raid. There\u2019s a great tempo to this one, and you can feel the energy of the crowd. This is not a quarter-empty Olympic stadium in Homebush in the rain - this. is. Queensland. 25 min: Australia win another penalty, and with the man advantage this time they kick to touch. It\u2019s a penalty against Scott Barrett - and our match referee has seen enough of the ill-discipline. Seven penalties conceded by the All Blacks already - and he warns the captain Cane, does Nick Berry. 23 min: Ach. They really need to bring in an orange card; don\u2019t they? Was it malicious? You wouldn\u2019t say so - he was guilty of carelessness at worst. Still - the protection of the head and player welfare has to be paramount in the game. And now we\u2019ve got Slipper and Cane in a bit of fisticuffs. The ABs skipper wasn\u2019t happy with the clean out from the centurion and went back for afters. There\u2019s some \u201cstrong pushes\u201d offered, but you wouldn\u2019t call that a punch from Cane, surely. The TMO is going to have another look. Deary me. \u201cDirect contact to the chin of the ball carrier. No factors of mitigation\u201d. Ofa Tu\u2019ungafasi has been given his marching orders! New Zealand are down to 14 men!! 23 min: The crowd\u2019s really into this. We might be having a TMO because Wright has taken a BIG knock from one of the Kiwi front rowers. It\u2019s Ofa! and he\u2019s caught the winger flush on the jaw with the point of the shoulder. Ay, ay. This could be a yellow card. Let\u2019s hope for the match it\u2019s not a red. And he slots it! Nice from Hodge, and Australia have there noses back in front. They take in the deep breaths; reset and await the kickoff once again. 20 min: Terrific offload from the hooker, Paenga-Amosa! He puts Koroibete in a hole, off the lineout. Could be a set play that, but terrific execution. They only just hang onto the back of the jersey, the ABs - but at the price of a penalty! Hodge takes a look at three extra - there\u2019s no breeze to speak of, and this one\u2019s gettable. 18 min: Australia dart short side, but they\u2019re out of real estate! It was Tom Wright who couldn\u2019t find a supporting man on the inside with the flick and they turn it over. Koroibete then lines up Jordie Barrett - great tackle. 17 min: R. Ioane goes up for the high ball, but he\u2019s let it through the arms - a little glance at on-rushing defenders perhaps. A nice box kick from White earns the error, and we set for a scrum about 30m out. Lachie Swinton, 7 tackles inside the first 17 minutes, and some of them have been massive. Great contribution. 15 min: Lineout steal, ABs! Both sides exchange kicks, but it\u2019s not the best from BB who chips right onto the chest of Koroibete. The crowd roars and he winds up, the winger. Good metres! We\u2019re around halfway, Australia in possession. 13 min: NZ win the lineout and Cane peels off quickly to get something moving. Swinton nails Scott Barrett! He\u2019s making himself felt already on his debut, the human fridge. Penalty against ABs - big Karl\u2019s joined the ruck incorrectly. 11 min: Have I just heard correctly - is this the first time in ABs shirts that TJ and Beauden have started a 9/10? Surely not. Feel free to update me, Kiwi rugby anoraks. A penalty against Australia as two bruising forwards get in each others\u2019 way and concede a cheap offside. NZ inside the 22 - a dangerous few minutes here for the home side. 8 min: Lovely hands from TJ Perenara before Jordie Barrett draws two players before offloading. They stretch Australia too thin and it\u2019s an easy dash to the corner for Rieko! 29 phases in two passages with the ball - terrific work New Zealand, and they hit straight back! The conversion attempt is beautifully struck from the touchline by Jordie Barrett - it bends.. but hits the post! No extras, we\u2019re 5-a-piece. 7 min: White with the box kick, but it\u2019s the Beauden-Jordie double act again that gets some good metres. Do you reckon they know each others\u2019 game, the brothers? Don\u2019t forget there are also Ioane brothers out there tonight - just perhaps don\u2019t expect Akire to combine with his younger bro like these two do. 5 min: A first look at some Barrett-Barrett action and it\u2019s good metres gained by the ABs. They\u2019re about 30m out and probing the Australian defence. Good spell this for New Zealand as they build 14 phases - before a knock on! 3 min: What a start for Australia! First decision on Hodge - does he run, does he pass? No! He elects to chip-kick and the on-rushing ABs defence is caught out. It\u2019s a fortuitous bounce into the arms of Banks who finds the debutant. How\u2019s this - a first touch as a Wallaby, and it\u2019s to score a try! Hodge with a chance to add the extras. He hooks it to the right. Ach. It\u2019s not a \u201cgimme\u201d but you\u2019d want to kick those. 2 min: First penalty to Australia! It\u2019s a good, positive start for the home side and Tom Banks kicks for touch to set up the line out in decent territory. 1 min: And we\u2019re away! It\u2019s the booming boot of Reece Hodge to get us under way. It\u2019s claimed by Sevu Reece who\u2019s immediately met with a wall of gold. It\u2019s an indifferent box kick first up from Perenara which almost gives Australia half a look, but the All Blacks recover well. Both our squads are on the field as we hear the singing of the national anthems - so I can confirm we are VERY close to live action. I don\u2019t know why but I\u2019m actually really looking forward to this (he says every time before the 80 minutes that follows). But first: Haka time. And what a roar from the crowd that\u2019s elicited. Nath Jones has written in with another celebrity spot: I met Zinzan Brooke in a bar in Parliament. I said \u201cI remember that drop-goal against England - the first World Cup drop-goal by a forward, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cNot the first drop-goal...\u201d he said, with a massive grin: \u201cThe only drop-goal.\u201d And what a moment that was. And for added effect I\u2019m imagining the exchange taking place at a urinal, which always gives these things an added je ne sais pas. So! To live pictures. The roar of the Brisbane crowd say it all - the All Blacks run out to the jets of fireworks, as we await the Wallabies, led out by centurion, James Slipper - just the 13th Australian to make that landmark. And he\u2019s now joined by the rest of the men in yellow gold. As we gather for a Welcome to Country, and then the national anthems. Conversely, the change at No10 for the ABs doesn\u2019t look too shabby a call, either. Imagine having a guy twice named World Player of the Year - and then playing him in a less-preferred position. Beauden Barrett will be back at flyhalf with his ol\u2019 Canes partner in crime TJ Perenara. Watch that combination sparkle like in the glory days. A shout out as well to two centurions. James Slipper will make his 100th bow for Australia in the front row, while Sam Whitelock will earn his 100th cap for New Zealand. What incredible landmarks, both. One thing I\u2019ll say about the \u201cgreat experiment\u201d of game three - namely dual debutants Noah Lolesio and Irae Simone in the playmaker roles - to a large extend you can\u2019t blame Rennie too much for the call, given the injury context to both James O\u2019Connor and Matt Toomua. Rolling the magic eight ball of alternate reality, you\u2019d say if either O\u2019Connor or Toomua had been available it would have been a much more assured showing. But the call to bring Hodge back into No10 might add a little steel in that key area of the park tonight. Our first contribution in \u201ccelebrity spots\u201d from jockokiwi: I saw Sam Cane at Brew Bar in Rotorua about a month ago when BOP lost at home to Auckland. I was surprised by how small he was. Magic. As a one-season second row I can confirm that back rowers really are runts. Mind you, I won\u2019t be telling a guy who\u2019s broken his neck and returned to international rugby as the captain of one of the most iconic teams in all world sport that to his face. So, for a reminder of #Mood from where we were at just seven days ago - it finished like this: The talk from inside camp is that \u201cthe boys are hurting\u201d so the thinking is there should be a bit of a rebound from the Wallabies this week. But is it simply a case of Australian rugby being just too far behind their opponents across the Tasman? For my humble two cents I put a lot of stock in new coach, Dave Rennie - his track record is well proven already at Super Rugby, with the Chiefs. There\u2019s no question building phases and decision making were massive disappointments last week. But there was a much better sense of discipline evident in game one. If they hold on to that, and build on the previous, then there\u2019s nothing to suggest Australia can\u2019t be right in the mix - especially up in Brisbane, which has been somewhat of a happy hunting ground in recent years. So, without further ado a reminder of the team news: Wallabies: 1. James Slipper, 2. Brandon Paenga-Amosa, 3. Allan Alaalatoa, 4. Rob Simmons, 5. Matt Philip, 6. Lachie Swinton, 7.

Massive changes for both sides - I believe 10x new faces from last week for the ABs - but as I alluded to in the preamble - not for a second would you call these \u201cweakened\u201d sides. Imagine the luxury of bringing in TJ Perenara, Ngani Laumape, Rieko Ioane, Sevu Reece etc etc and that\u2019s your \u201cbackup\u201d XV. For the Wallabies, injury to Lukhan Salakaia-Loto sees Rob Simmons into the run-on side, Lachie Swinton is handed a debut in the back row. The debutant playmakers from last week have both paid for indifferent showings, Reece Hodge comes in at fly half and twin Toms, Banks and Wright, come in at the back. As always with Guardian minute-by-minutes it\u2019s a case of the more the merrier. Have you spent the past week pouring over the stats, rewatching the tape and identified some potential bright spots for the Wallabies/weak spots for the All Blacks? Do you have the power of \u201cthe sight\u201d and can share a prediction with us? We\u2019d love to hear from you. Shoot me an email or tweet to join the conversation. Don\u2019t be shy now. I\u2019ll even settle for \u201cI saw Scott Barrett in Palmerston North New World the other day, and he seems a really nice guy\u201d style anecdotes. Hi ho! A best of seasons to you and yours, from wherever around the world you\u2019re following our coverage today. I\u2019m Richard Parkin and I\u2019ll be in the chair for the next few hours for Operation Redemption (Wallabies fans) or Operation Ruthless Evisceration (for my whanau across the dutch). Of course, for the neutral Operation Decent Contest could be something to hope for. We definitely saw that in game one in Wellington, so for the global audience at least, let\u2019s hope it\u2019s a bit more of that, and a bit less of last week. Plenty to chat about pre-game, but before we get into talking points, maybe start with our match preview from Bret Harris: Hardest gig in rugby right now, I reckon - covering the Wallabies on their slide down the world rankings. Call me a sucker though, but this time - just this time - I reckon there\u2019s a little something called \u201cHope\u201d left in Pandora\u2019s Box. \u201cDead rubber or dead cat bounce?\u201d Such was the emphatic nature of the All Blacks\u2019 record drubbing in Bledisloe III that ahead of game four the narrative has been borderline disrespectful. In the forge of contest last Saturday, the Wallabies\u2019 young tyros melted. But that in no way implies that this weekend\u2019s clash is of little consequence - despite an All Blacks skipper lifting ol\u2019 Jug Ears for an eighteenth consecutive time. With Rugby Championship points on the line, and with both sides set for Argentina in coming weeks, there will be competition for places, much needed opportunities for minutes in the centre, and from an Australian perspective - a keening desire to salvage some semblance of pride after game three\u2019s shellacking. The noises Dave Rennie made post-game were positive on that front, and while both coaches have shuffled their packs dramatically there\u2019s certainly no sense that the XVs we\u2019ll see today represent \u201cweakened\u201d teams. Just ask Ardie Savea what it means to pull on the famous black shirt after sitting out last week. With the Bledisloe resolved for another year, this still remains a rugby Test between Australia and New Zealand. And with the pressure off and some old heads returning at key positions, might the Wallabies play with a little more freedom? There\u2019s only one way to find out - so clear the calendar, take the phone of the hook and plump those cushions: it\u2019s Bledisloe IV."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
