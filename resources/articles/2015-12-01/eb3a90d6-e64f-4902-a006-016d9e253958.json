And yet, as the candidates take the stage on Saturday for the third Democratic presidential debate, the Vermont senator finds himself on the defensive over gun control. The issue has risen to prominence amid a series of high-profile shootings, from Charleston to Roseburg and San Bernardino. At the debate in Manchester, New Hampshire, the question is likely to rise again: faced with an epidemic of gun violence, what more can America do? There are few policy areas in which Sanders\u2019s opponents have attacked him from the left. But on gun control, frontrunner Hillary Clinton has drawn a contrast between her long-held progressive views and Sanders\u2019s somewhat mixed record. A key area of disagreement was laid bare in the first debate in October, when Sanders struggled to explain his support for a bill in 2005 that granted legal protections to gun manufacturers. Attacked by Clinton and former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley, Sanders said he voted for \u201ca large and complicated bill\u201d. Clinton countered by pointing out that she had voted against the same measure and had not found it \u201cthat complicated\u201d. In the two months since, Sanders has continued to face questions about legal immunity for gunmakers. While he has expressed openness to revisiting the legislation, he has maintained his opposition to some of its components. \u201cIf a gun manufacturer understands and knows that the product he is selling to a community is really getting out to criminal elements, that gun manufacturer should be held liable for what the company is doing,\u201d Sanders said on CBS this month. \u201cIf a small gun shop owner in the state of Vermont sells a product, a gun, legally to somebody else who then goes out and does something crazy, do I think that small gun shop owner should be held liable for legally selling the product? No, I don\u2019t.\u201d Other votes from Sanders\u2019s past, however, also put him at odds with the majority of Democrats and instead on the side of the NRA. In 2006, as a member of the House of Representatives, Sanders voted in favor of a bill that would have made it harder for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to revoke the licenses of gun dealers who violated federal laws. Although the measure was bipartisan, the majority of Democrats,123, voted against. Sixty-three voted for it. According to reports at the time, the bill \u201cangered\u201d New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg \u2013 a staunch advocate of stricter gun laws \u2013 and was placed on hold in the Senate by Chuck Schumer, also of New York. The bill, which was backed by the NRA, also contained a provision allowing dealers whose licenses expired or were suspended or revoked 60 days in which to liquidate their inventories. There was also a House vote in 1993 on an amendment that would have established a loophole in the waiting period for background checks. Under the amendment, backed by Sanders, a gun purchase would proceed by default if the background check was not completed within one business day. The amendment was to be part of the Brady Bill, landmark legislation that mandated federal background checks. Ultimately, it was tweaked to a three-day period. That rule has come under scrutiny this year, after nine African American churchgoers were killed in a racially motivated mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina in June. Authorities later said suspected gunman Dylann Roof\u2019s gun purchase was automatically approved, despite a previous drug offense, because the background check was not completed in three days. Clinton has included closing the so-called \u201cCharleston loophole\u201d in her proposals for gun control. In a recent campaign email, Sanders embraced the idea. In the same message to his supporters, the senator called for the reinstatement of federal funding for gun violence research \u2013 a ban adopted at the behest of the NRA two decades ago and supported, at the time, by Sanders. \u2018I come from a state that doesn\u2019t have any gun control\u2019 While pushing back against criticism from Clinton and O\u2019Malley, Sanders has often cited low rates of gun violence in Vermont, the rural state he has represented in Congress since 1991. In an interview with the Guardian published on Friday, Sanders argued that his views were guided by the existence of a broad consensus \u2013 while pointing to his support for an assault weapons ban, limits on high-capacity magazines, keeping guns out of the hands of domestic violence abusers, universal background checks and mental health reforms. \u201cIt is not very different from what Hillary Clinton or anybody else believes,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut politics being what it is, they saw that as a vulnerability of mine because I come from a state that doesn\u2019t have any gun control but I think we\u2019re handling it fine now.\u201d Indeed, in recent years Sanders has voted with Democrats on key anti-gun violence bills \u2013 most notably to expand background checks in 2013 in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in which 20 children and six adults were killed. This month, days after a shooting left 14 dead in San Bernardino, California, he voted to prevent individuals on the terror watch list from obtaining firearms. Neither measure was able to overcome Republican-led opposition. As far as the broader gun control debate is concerned, the three Democratic candidates are largely aligned against the Republican field. Not a single GOP presidential hopeful supports any form of new gun laws \u2013 even expanded background checks, despite an overwhelming majority of the American public supporting such reform. \u2018All the shouting in the world\u2019 As Democrats campaign more aggressively on gun control than any time in recent history, Sanders\u2019 opponents have nonetheless sought to exploit his gun record as a rare breach with his progressive base. Sanders has also taken to playing up the issue on the campaign trail, particularly after the San Bernardino shooting, which led O\u2019Malley\u2019s campaign to charge that he had been \u201cshamed\u201d into discussing gun violence. Clinton, too, has taken thinly veiled jabs at Sanders \u2013 teeing off from his assertion in the first debate that \u201call the shouting in the world\u201d would not lead to results. \u201cI haven\u2019t been shouting, but sometimes when a woman speaks out, some people think it\u2019s shouting,\u201d Clinton has since said. In October, Clinton issued an expansive plan to reduce gun violence that in addition to closing the Charleston loophole would expand background checks, roll back legal immunity for the gun industry, classify straw purchasing as a federal crime, and implement measures to prevent those convicted of domestic violence from purchasing guns. For months, in what has become a central tenet of her candidacy as frustration with Congressional inaction spreads, Clinton has highlighted gun violence. Though it is not certain that she will raise the issue on the debate stage in Manchester, Sanders has often used such moments to remind the American public that he, unlike Clinton, has stood against Wall Street \u201csince day one\u201d. On the issue of guns, it is Clinton who might make that case."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
