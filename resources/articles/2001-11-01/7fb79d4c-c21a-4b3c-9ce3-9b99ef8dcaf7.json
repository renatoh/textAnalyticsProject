Making her debut in a high-profile negligence court case that pits Unilever against Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (MLIM), Ms Galley defended the record of her colleague, Alistair Lennard, a fund manager who ran Unilever's \u00a31bn UK equities portfolio. Unilever is suing MLIM for negligence, claming that Ms Galley failed to exercise adequate control over Mr Lennard as Unilever's investments turned sour in 1997. In 1998, Unilever fired MLIM after Unilever's portfolio of investments underperformed an agreed benchmark by 10.5%. Cutting an assured figure on the witness stand, Ms Galley said: \"The figures from the end of 1996 to the start of 1998 were very disappointing. We were all very upset and disappointed and surprised by the scale of the underperformance quarter after quarter for two years. But it was the stock market and the performance of the stock market in this period which caused these returns.\" Ms Galley said that the final quarter of 1996 was the turning point in the stock market, which went on and on and ultimately culminated in the financial bubble that burst with technology stocks last year. Ms Galley told Mr Justice Colman, the presiding judge, that although Mr Lennard took a series of mistaken decisions, he was properly supervised and was caught out by an \"extraordinary\" period of unpredictable volatility in the stock market While admitting that that all the disastrously performing Unilever funds managed by Mercury in 1996 and 1997 had been under Mr Lennard's control, she argued that Mr Lennard's portfolios were consistent with the framework and way of managing money that had been established in Mercury for many years. MLIM was known as Mercury Asset Management until it was acquired by Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank. Ms Galley pointed out that in 1995 Mr Lennard's results were \"probably the best\" of the Mercury's fund management team and that his supervisors had scrutinised the make-up of his portfolios once results dipped. \"In the circumstances of the stock market in 1996 and 1997, he had underperformed by a margin not forecastable by our process,\" Ms Galley said. \"One of the extraordinary facets of the market place was that relatively small differences in the kinds and sizes of shares held in portfolios could give much bigger differences between portfolios than history had taught us could be the case.\" She denied there was any correlation between the fact Mr Lennard held higher amounts of stock in portfolios than his colleagues and the greater scale of his losses. Stressing that Mr Lennard had been strictly supervised throughout the ill-fated two-year period, Ms Galley insisted: \"At all times we knew what the level of risk in his portfolios was and judged it within the bounds of reasonableness.\" The case has attracted intense interest because of Ms Galley, chief operating officer at MLIM. In the space of 15 years, Ms Galley, 53, enjoyed a meteoric rise from library researcher to her present position, amassing a reputed \u00a3100m personal fortune along the way. A pay survey recently estimated her annual income to be \u00a310m and put her among the UK's five richest women, two places below the Queen. The Sheffield-born grammar school girl quickly gained a reputation for ruthlessness in her relentless quest to extract value for her pension fund clients. Now she is under attack by one of those pension funds she used to represent. Her turn on the stand followed that of another top City woman - Wendy Mayall, chief investment manager for Unilever's pension fund. Ms Galley is expected to face a week of cross-examination. The case continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
