Extending from the hem of a ne at little scarlet two-piece, the pins belonged to Nikolas Fransson - 'but today you can call me Ninotchka' - one of two towering tran svestite stewardesses helping to usher a couple of hundred men and women on to one very special locomotive. 'Welcome all you faggots, royalties and spoo ky things,' purred a heavily accented, gender-non-specific voice over the PA system, as the GayTrain pulled away. The world's only train chartered specifically for a gay event, its mission was to transport a crowd of skiing, snowboarding and, above all, partying pink punters to the northern resort of \u00c5re, for \u00c5re Gay Days, a four-day event now in its second year, which attracts around 2,000 people. The eight-hour journey began sedately enough. Some, with admirable foresight, took a nap. Some meandered from carriage to carriage, greeting old friends; some sought out new ones. But as the last of the gloomy grey light faded over the endless, snow-dusted featureless land north of Sweden's capital city, the true colours of this mobile microcosm started to show. The bar car was where it all began. A steady trickle of men and women, old and young, high-camp and low-key, mingling with a clique-free ease rarely seen at British gay events, trickled in to wet this baby's head. Kenny, a big, smiley softie in minimalist, rubber-fetish chic teamed with cosy ski hat and goggles - later exchanged for red nose and antlers - and his spectacular man-lady colleague, in a black and white check mini-dress and hat apparently fashioned from a pair of Ivana Trump's cast-off furry moonboots (circa 1982), served up Carlsberg and cocktails while, in the corner, a pair of cheeky crewcut dykes opened for business at a collapsible mini-casino. Meanwhile, in the restaurant car, the members of ubiquitous drag act Cunigunda applied outrageous make-up with a combination of a bricklayer's mortar-slinging generosity and a geisha's precision. The GayTrain truly hit its stride when the disco car, complete with spinning mirror- balls, decks and a tiny stage area, boomed into life. First-comers were a small pod of pouting, topless muscle boys, including, he pointedly informed me, Mr Gay Sweden 2001. They were swiftly engulfed by the tidal wave of dancefloor-ready revellers drawn by the thumping house beats. The cover band, Afrodite, rocked the house with a selection of Seventies and Eighties classics, and when Kylie's 'Can't Get You Out of My Head' kicked in, you could feel the whole car bounce, bounce, bounce on the tracks. 'Tickets please,' asked a terribly proper, uniformed conductor, before slinging his ticket machine over one shoulder to gyrate briefly with a grinning go-go boy, then straightening his cap and continuing his rounds. A feverish little parallel universe shimmying through the freezing Swedish night, the GayTrain triumphantly set the tone for a wild weekend up country. Predictably, the next morning's sport was somewhat subdued. A universal hangover conspired with slushy snow and bad light to keep plenty of bleary-eyed attendees' on-piste activities minimal, although most dragged themselves up the mountain for lunch at Hummelstugan restaurant, where the magnificent stuffed moose, eagles and bears accustomed to dominating the scene were mercilessly upstaged by the day's welcoming committee, three 7ft 'hostesses' in spike-heeled boots, Bonnie Tyler wigs and full-length day-glo fun-fur coats. Thanks to dreary weather and week-old snow, the daytime activities remained low-priority all weekend; many sensibly opted to sleep off party damage for most of the sunlit hours. On the last day, however, some muted sunshine allowed the mountains' upper, crisper slopes to open, and those of us who took to our skis and boards were rewarded with a brief glimpse of the resort's true glory. As the sun finally got a look-in below the blanket of charcoal cloud which shrouded the resort all weekend, the sky turned a brilliant pink and the semi-frozen lake at the mountain's foot morphed into a tract of gleaming fuchsia lava. Apr\u00e8s-ski was built along something-for-everyone lines, offering a range of entertainments: the gleeful murder of some golden oldies by the train's stewardesses, Ninotchka and Ru Harriet; a women-only knees-up by the fireside of Tottebo, a cosy local bar; and a hilarious bingo fundraiser hosted by 'Cunigundas mammor', the Cunigunda crew dressed up as their fictional, frumpy mothers - all wrinkled tights, conservative cardies and po-faced scowls, dishing out useless prizes and choice abuse to winners - and raising 4,000 kroner (\u00a3266) for the HIV charity Posithiva Gruppens in the process. Other local delights included the chance to taste reindeer, elk, capercaillie, cloudberries and other local delicacies at the superb, secluded Buustamon's Fj\u00e4llg\u00e5rd restaurant, only reachable by Skidoo and a reindeer-sled ride, where the apparent misery of the harnessed beasts was offset by the ebullience of Cunigunda's female member, Leo, geeing them up while wearing a full rubber and fun-fur ensemble, to the visible amusement of our Lapp guide. A minor wake-up call came in the form of a volley of abuse and spit fired off a balcony by a group of boys as a small party of us arrived at a local pizzeria, although whether this was because we were part of the queer extravaganza or simply because they were gobbing enthusiasts wasn't clear. In any case, their aim sucked. Gay Days' crowning glory was the abundance of late parties, usually four a night. Far from being exclusive gay events, the bashes drew local crowds and offered an affable and enviable model of integration and diversity. The most hysterical highlight was the party jointly hosted by Cunigunda and the Stockholm-based gay magazine QX at Bar Bygget (any irony apparently unintentional). On stage, drag culture's past and future joyously collided, as old-school diva Babsan, looking for all the world like Catherine Deneuve's pink-rinsed transsexual uncle, delivered a set of disco stompers culminating in a rousing, if inevitable 'J\u00e4g Ar Vad J\u00e4g Ar' ('I Am What I Am'). Next, the stage was stormed by Cunigunda, who destroyed any tired concepts of mincing female parody and gender stereotypes in favour of styling themselves as three surreal, latex-clad Amazons beamed down from Planet Drag. They ditched disco kitsch in favour of a heroic mix of trash rock and Hi-NRG, putting AC/DC, techno and Limp Bizkit through a sonic blender and working the crowd into a frenzy. The following night, Bygget hosted another eye-opening meltdown, hosted by brother and sister queer websites Sylvester and Sylvia. While the disco bunnies swished to hard house in one room, DJ Tomas Hemstad gave the lie to the Gay= Disco Dolly myth with an aggressive mix of rock, funk, ska and hip-hop, proving that dykes and poofs like to pogo too. On the final day, the exhausted crowd fell into a stupor on the GayTrain's return journey, stunned into silence as an inspirational sunset silhouetted the pine forests and was mirrored in endless lakes. Darkness's fall triggered a final burst of energy, and sent the disco car bouncing back into Stockholm. Taking a fond farewell look at the train over my shoulder, I saw Ninotchka leaning out of a window giving a royal wave. 'Same time next year, yes?' Oh yes.
