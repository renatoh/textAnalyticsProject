Rain or shine, partygoers wait to enter and shimmy off their jackets and trousers \u2026 revealing leather and latex, colourful lingerie, DIY costumes or simply nothing at all. Opened in 1994, KitKatClub\u2019s name is inspired by the burlesque Kit Kat Klub in the musical Cabaret, set in 1930s Berlin against the backdrop of the Nazis rise to power. The fetish club is famed, and notorious, for its fantastical dress code, high-profile techno DJs and also allowing sex. Guests are free to have intercourse across dancefloors and in dark rooms but must never feel compelled to \u2013 according to a club policy touting respect, discretion and safety. Soon, however, the underground venue \u2013 which has helped define Berlin\u2019s open-minded, alternative image \u2013 might be forced to close. According to the Clubcommission, an association representing local nightlife, the property lease for KitKat and the neighbouring Sage nightclub is up in June 2020 and has not yet been renewed. \u201cThe premises are partly owned by a Munich investor which has threatened [lease] termination several times,\u201d says Lutz Leichsenring, Clubcommission\u2019s spokesman. \u201cThere would need to be a new contract and then it\u2019s a question of under what conditions and how long-term that contract will be.\u201d The location was home to several clubs before KitKat, and has played an important role in Berlin\u2019s history as a techno haven. But in the expanding German capital, the space, in the central Mitte area, would be attractive to build a hotel or offices, says Leichsenring. Several clubs and live music venues have closed in recent years due to new construction, rising rents and noise complaints. Leichsenring says many popular nightclubs are in precarious situations, including Wilde Renate, Else and ://about blank, which could be demolished to make way for a new stretch of highway. Part of the problem, says Leichsenring, is that \u201cinvestors who just want to cash in, own the building but never renovate or invest in it, while still wanting more rent every year.\u201d \u201cClubs can only stand this up to a certain point because otherwise they can\u2019t finance big bookings and are in danger of becoming mainstream clubs where only hits are played. No one comes to Berlin for chart music or table service.\u201d \u201cKitKat has been around for 25 years because as well as being inclusive, it offers something else that most other spaces do not, with its sexual openness,\u201d said Daniel Cole, a music journalist and DJ in Berlin. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the city\u2019s longest running clubs, thanks to a strong and loyal community base, and a city full of open-minded revellers who love to really let loose.\u201d German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats (CDU), a party known for its conservative family values, has, surprisingly, stepped in to help. CDU politician Christian Goiny, a Berlin native, says \u201cIt would be a loss and a bad signal\u201d if KitKat were to close. It shows how valued the scene is, despite controversies, such as drug deaths and a meningitis scare in KitKat last year. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to necessarily find it good but we believe nonetheless that club culture is important for a city and society,\u201d says Goiny. \u201cClubs are independent mid-size businesses, they have 100, 200 employees \u2026 It\u2019s not just free time, fun and creativity. There is an economic element.\u201d A government study earlier this year found that every third tourist comes to Berlin for clubbing. The scene generated a \u20ac1.48bn turnover in 2018.
