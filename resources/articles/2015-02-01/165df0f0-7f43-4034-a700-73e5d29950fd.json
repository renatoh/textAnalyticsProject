Representatives from Treasury and the departments of Health and Finance were pressed by a Senate committee on Thursday about what advice they had provided to the government on the implications of increasing costs for GP consultations. \u201cYou haven\u2019t done any specific research on co-payments, is that correct?\u201d Labor senator Doug Cameron asked the panel of eight senior public servants. \u201cI\u2019m unaware of any substantive work in Australia specifically about the impact of something like [the] Medicare co-payment and reduction in rebate,\u201d the deputy secretary of the Health Department, Andrew Stuart, said. \u201cThere are significant methodological difficulties and significant time required to do any kind of meaningful research on co-payments,\u201d he said. The department did not say if it was asked to conduct research by the federal government before it announced the co-payment policy in the 2014 federal budget. Instead, the department undertook an extensive review of international research. But Stuart admits that data is old and not necessarily applicable. \u201cThe international material and research is very equivocal and not directly related to the current Australian situation,\u201d Stuart said. \u201cYou say you rely on international evidence and research, and when I ask if you\u2019ve done any of your own you say no, and then I ask what is the international evidence, you say it\u2019s equivocal, and you have to take into account the specific circumstances in Australia. Who has been looking at the specific circumstances in Australia?\u201d Cameron asked. Stuart answered that the department had \u201cread the available evidence\u201d. The committee members became frustrated at the lack of answers given, and asked that the committee be rescheduled to allow for further questioning. \u201cI am very worried that this [co-payment] policy has been made without any evidence base,\u201d Cameron said, before leaving the committee. The government ditched a plan unveiled in the last federal budget to charge patients $7 for seeing a GP. It replaced the policy with a plan to reduce the rebate for GP visits by $5, and cut the rebate for consultations under 10 minutes by $20. Public outcry and crossbench dissatisfaction caused the new health minister Sussan Ley to scrap the $20 rebate cut last month. Former health minister Peter Dutton was criticised by health professionals for failing to discuss the co-payment policy with the industry. Ley is currently engaging in a consultation process with a number of healthcare groups."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
