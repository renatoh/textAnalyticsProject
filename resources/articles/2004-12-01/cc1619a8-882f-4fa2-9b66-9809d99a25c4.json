Place the beets in a small roasting pan and add the olive oil. Roast for an hour or more, depending on their size. When cooked, cool and half or quarter, then keep aside until ready to assemble the salad. Cook the bulgur in plenty of water until soft, and drain. Place in a large bowl and add an extra 1tbsp of oil if needed, plus the lemon juice and zest. Mix well and add the chickpeas, onion, carrots, beetroot and basil. Mix gently and serve. Cost: \u00a32.60 Pan-fried smoked haddock with beetroot puree and sauteed sweet potatoes Don't buy the bright yellow haddock: it contains dye. Instead, ask your fishmonger to get you the lemon-coloured smoked haddock, which has been prepared more naturally. All these ingredients have the warm colours of an Indian summer. The haddock is also delicious if poached in milk instead of pan-fried. 4 fillets smoked haddock, about 150g each 100ml milk handful of plain flour olive oil 2 large orange-fleshed sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced into discs 1cm thick For the beet puree: 2 shallots, finely chopped 1tbsp lemon thyme leaves 2 rashers smoked bacon 4 large Burpees Golden beetroots, washed, peeled and chopped into small pieces 50ml double cream salt and pepper First, remove the skin of the haddock. This is not difficult, but you do need confidence, so if uncertain, ask your fishmonger to do it for you. Place the fish pieces in a flat dish and pour over the milk. Let stand for a couple of hours. Meanwhile, prepare the beet puree. Sweat the shallot and thyme in 1tbsp olive oil, then add the bacon and continue cooking. Add the beet pieces and cook until they are soft, which will take about 20 minutes. Finally, add the cream and simmer for a few more minutes. Remove the bacon. Season to taste, liquidise and pass through a sieve. Keep warm. Now take the haddock out of the milk and dry well with kitchen paper. Coat the fish with plain flour. Heat about 2tbsp olive oil in a heavy frying pan and, when hot enough, pan-fry the haddock for about three minutes on each side. To prepare the sweet potatoes, boil them for about three minutes until semi-soft. Drain them well and saut\u00e9 in 2tbsp hot olive oil until browned. To serve, spoon some beet puree on to the middle of each plate, place a fillet of haddock on the top, and have the sauteed sweet potatoes on the side. Cost: \u00a38.90 Chocolate and cardamom torte For the torte: 300g cooking chocolate, 70% cocoa solids 150g unsalted butter 1tsp ground cardamom 6 eggs, separated 40g caster sugar For the chocolate sauce: 200g milk chocolate, chopped 100ml water 1tsp ground cardamom Pre-heat oven to 180C. Line a spring-bottomed cake tin (about 18cm) with baking paper. Chop the chocolate into small cubes and place it, together with the butter, in a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water to melt. Meanwhile, beat the egg yolks, half the sugar and the cardamom until pale and very thick and creamy. Add the melted chocolate and mix. Keep aside. In a clean bowl, whisk the egg whites and the remaining half of the sugar until stiff. Now carefully add the egg whites to the egg and chocolate mixture, making sure you stir it very gently. When mixed, pour it all into the prepared tin and place in the oven for 20-25 minutes. The torte will be of a mousse-like consistency. To make the chocolate sauce, bring the water to the boil, then add the chocolate and cardamom, whisking all the time. The sauce will be thick and glossy. Serve the torte with warm chocolate sauce.

It is the 51st and, as you can see, there is no loss of stately appetite on the cook's part, or the wine waiter's. However, beetroot is a moody devil to partner (except in borscht, where liberal slugs of iced bison-grass vodka, a liquid beyond my remit, is recommended). In her first course, with the bulgur and chickpeas and lemon, there is, it is true, an immediate compatibility with crisp white wine - and we can find one without demur - but in the second course we have to dig deeper. But on to the first course, and so let us nip out to Sainsbury's and acquire a bottle of the own-label, non-vintage Vin de Pays d'Oc Blanc (16 points, \u00a32.99). It is a delightfully lithe, tangy white wine of supreme quaffability and first-course friendliness. Will it, though, work alongside the smoked haddock with beetroot puree and sweet potatoes? I feel it might struggle a bit with the richness of the fish and so, while you can use the Sainsbury's white wine, I think we need something smokier and sexier. Tesco's Chilean Chardonnay (16 points, \u00a32.97) is a smart move, but even more so is the same store's Isla Negra Chardonnay 2000 (16.5 points, reduced to \u00a32.99 from \u00a35.99 from December 8). This Chilean has the level of incisive smokiness required. To finish, with the pud, we must break the bank, and my \u00a310 wine budget. We will visit Morrisons/Safeway and nab a half-bottle of non-vintage Beaumes de Venise (16 points, \u00a34.29), one of the most agreeably honied and peachy of sweeties, very opulent and waxy and perfect with the torte. Farewell! And, please, continue to eat and drink well, with our best wishes. superplonk@aol.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
