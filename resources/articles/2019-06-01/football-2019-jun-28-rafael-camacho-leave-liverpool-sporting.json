The 19-year-old will return to the club where he started his career, having resisted overtures from Milan, Wolves and Schalke amid concerns over a lack of first-team opportunities. Liverpool had wanted to retain the Portugal under-18 international but faced a choice of selling to Sporting this summer or losing him for a nominal compensation fee next year once he rejected a new deal with the Champions League winners. Camacho\u2019s fee could rise to \u00a37m depending on bonus payments related to Sporting\u2019s league and European achievements. The deal includes a 20% sell-on fee for Liverpool, who have also included a buy-back option. Sporting tried to sign the versatile forward on loan in January. Camacho\u2019s transfer is not tied in any way to the future of Bruno Fernandes, the Sporting midfielder who has been linked with a possible \u00a355m move to Anfield, as Liverpool are not among the clubs interested in the 24-year-old."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
