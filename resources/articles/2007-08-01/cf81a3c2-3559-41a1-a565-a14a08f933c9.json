Now their questions may have been answered by Italy's civil aviation chief, Vito Riggio, who has accused lazy handling staff of sabotaging the belts up to 10 times a day to ease the fast pace of their working day and to win some valuable overtime. Mr Riggio told La Repubblica he was demanding a police investigation on the strength of video evidence which, according to the Italian daily newspaper, shows chewing gum stuck on luggage bar code readers and conveyor belts deliberately immobilised with suitcases, nails or plastic bags. \"How is it possible that at an international airport like Rome there are delinquents who, in order to work less or perhaps put in some overtime, send the whole airport into crisis, inconveniencing passengers around the world?\" he asked. Fiumicino temporarily misplaced 7,000 items of luggage a week ago, a problem that Aeroporti di Roma put down to a loss of electrical current. The company has since announced that it will invest in a better system for loading baggage on to aircraft. But waiting times of more than an hour to collect luggage were still being reported this weekend as 110,000 passengers a day passed through the airport. A spokesman declined to comment on the new accusation of sabotage by lazy workers. Aeroporti di Roma also manages Rome's low-cost flights airport, Ciampino, where seven luggage handlers working for a contracted handling firm were arrested in April on charges of auctioning jewellery, cameras and mobile phones they had pilfered from passing luggage, often belonging to tourists arriving from the UK."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
