But even in France, UK pensioners will miss out on certain payments while shouldering other financial burdens they would avoid had they stayed in Britain. When schoolteacher Anita Emery and her husband Colin Parfitt, a lecturer at North London Polytechnic, decided to take early retirement, they had to choose where to live. Should they stay in Plumstead Common - a small green triangle in a grimy corner of south east London - or move to Montrollet, a hamlet in verdant rolling countryside in south west France? They opted for the latter and a life spent pottering round local markets and villages, walking their dog in the nearby forests and looking after a growing collection of elderly horses. But, like many people moving to France in their fifties, Anita and Colin were shocked to discover they would not be entitled to free healthcare until they reached UK pensionable age - almost ten years away. In effect, early retirees have to fund their own healthcare until they turn 60 or 65 when the UK government finally picks up the vast majority of the tab. How much you pay is linked to your taxable income. When Anita and Colin first moved to Montrollet ten years ago they had to pay 15% into the French healthcare system. \"It was quite a chunk,\" says Anita,\" and at one point we did seriously think about coming back to the UK. Luckily, the following year the French government raised the income thresholds - mainly to protect young French people on low incomes rather than old English people and our payments dropped to 8%.\" However this still only covered 70-80% of all medical costs and most people, French and English, take out top-up insurance , known as a mutuelle or a complementaire - with a local insurer. \"This costs us around \u00a410,000 a year.\" says Colin. \"But it covers us for anything and French medical care is superb. \"An English friend, Kay, is just recovering from a triple by-pass heart operation and, in addition to his three-week stay in a private room in hospital, he gets a further five-week stay at a specialist convalescent home.\" On reaching retirement age, Brits resident in France no longer have to pay the 8%, although a mutuelle is highly advisable. Another issue for early retirees is national insurance contributions. If you stay in the UK, the state pays your NI between the ages of 60 and 65. Move abroad and you must cough up. Colin, who will be 65 in October, and Anita, 60, have not paid any NI contributions since arriving in France which means neither is entitled to a full state pension. What they do get, is index-linked and paid directly into a French bank account. Anita also got the UK Christmas bonus - worth \u00a310 this year. But the thing that strikes many pensioners, shivering in drafty stone cottages as rather mean is the fact they can't get the \u00a3200 winter fuel allowance.* \"It's been snowing for days and it was minus 10 this morning\" says Anita who reckons they spend about \u00a3100 on firewood and \u00a3400 on oil for the central heating each winter. And Brits can forget about a bus pass. There is virtually no public transport in rural France. Instead you can pay \u20ac50 for an annual rail card that entitles the holder to 50% off most rail journeys. But, comparedwith their old London neighbours, Arthur and Claire, who are retiring to New Zealand in the summer, Anita and Colin consider themselves fairly treated by the UK government. *If you received the winter fuel allowance before leaving the UK you may still be eligible - contact the Winter Fuel Payment centre on + 44 29 2042 8635"}, "isHosted": false}}}
