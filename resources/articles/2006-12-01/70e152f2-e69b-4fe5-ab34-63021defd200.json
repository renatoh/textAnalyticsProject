Having displayed a ballsy singing voice and a way with low humour in the adaptation of High Fidelity in 2000, it was surely only a matter of time before music became simply another way for Jack Black to incrementally take over the world. Now synonymous with the word \"rock\" in about the same way that Bill &amp; Ted became so with the word \"excellent\", Black and bandmate Kyle Gass have created a hugely, if puzzlingly, popular format of terrible jokes and acoustic guitar-based hard rock that, like South Park, appeals almost exclusively to teenage boys and middle-aged men. Now to be found starring in The Pick Of Destiny, a heroic account of the pair's meeting and mission, here Tenacious D play their biggest shows yet, which they'll be doing with a full band. The better, of course, to rock you. \u00b7 SECC, Glasgow, Mon 11; Manchester Evening News Arena, Tue 12; Birmingham NEC, Fri 15 The Horrors On tour Probably rather against their expectations, The Horrors have found themselves one of the phenomena of 2006. There's much to love in their ragged take on mid-1960s garage rock, but the real story has been the way the band have stormed into the public consciousness. On some level, they're what we hope for in a rock'n'roll band: from the haircuts, to the ideas, to the noise they make, it's something that exists in the moment, and whether anything so humdrum as a career emerges is really rather beside the point. \u00b7 Bar Academy, Birmingham, Sat 9; Satan's Hollow, Manchester, Sun 10; Oran Mor, Glasgow, Mon 11; Vaults, Edinburgh, Tue 12; Newcastle University Students Union, Wed 13 The Books On tour A pretty softly spoken bunch, The Books are a band whose music, helpfully, issues forth from a library. Collectors of found vocal sounds and other noises, their LPs so far have come from their gathered repository of mutterings and strange isolated pronouncements, and their most recent one Lost And Safe has done so to surprising acclaim. Surprising because the work of Paul De Jong and Nick Zammuto falls between two stools: neither full-throttle experimental music nor straightforward pop, instead they've refined things so that they make fairly traditional song-based structures, which are given added texture by the found voices. It couldn't be very much less in your face, but this is a show in which patience may prove to be its own reward. \u00b7 Queen Elizabeth Hall, SE1, Mon 11"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
