The correlation also works in reverse, with children in the youth justice system 15 times more likely to also be known to the child protection system than children who have not been in trouble with the law. The results come from a report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, using new linked data sets that allow researchers to track individual children through both systems. It examined reports of 30,402 children aged 10 to 17 who were known to either the child protection system or the youth justice system in Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, Queensland or the Australian Capital Territory in 2014-15. Linked data for the Northern Territory and Western Australia, which make up 53.8% of children in the child protection system and 48.7% of those in the youth justice system, was not available. A third of all children in the youth justice system, which included community orders, had a child protection notification for the same year. When only children in detention were considered, the rate increased to four out of five, making children in detention 19 times more likely to be known to the child protection system than children in the general community. The younger a child was at their first contact with the youth justice system, the more likely they were to also be known to child protection: three out of five of those who had their first contact with the justice system at the age of 10 were known to child protection, compared with less than one in 10 of those who did not come into contact with the justice system until they were 17. It comes after the Victorian commissioner for Aboriginal children and young people, Andrew Jackomos, called for a radical overhaul of the state\u2019s child protection system, which, he said, was failing Koori children. Jackomos released findings of a 59% increase in the number of Indigenous children in Victoria in out-of-home care between 2013 and 2015, and that many were denied cultural connection. Indigenous children make up 20% of children in out-of-home care in Victoria, despite only being 1% of the population. Nationally, Indigenous children are 27 times more likely to be in youth detention than non-Indigenous children. They make up 54% of detainees, despite only being 3% of the population. The institute\u2019s report found 11.3% of Indigenous boys in out-of-home care were also known to the youth justice system, compared with 7.5% of non-Indigenous boys, 6.6% of Indigenous girls and 3.3% of non-Indigenous girls. Seen from the other angle, 51.9% of Indigenous girls in youth detention were also known to the child protection system, compared with 49.2% of non-Indigenous girls, 40.2% of non-Indigenous boys and 36.2% of Indigenous boys."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
