The latest bid for relevance comes as Cooper Hefner, the 25-year-old son of nonagenarian founder Hugh Hefner, takes the reins as the magazine\u2019s chief creative officer. \u201cI\u2019ll be the first to admit that the way in which the magazine portrayed nudity was dated, but nudity was never the problem because nudity isn\u2019t a problem,\u201d the younger Hefner said in a statement. \u201cToday we\u2019re taking our identity back and reclaiming who we are.\u201d Playboy scrapped nudes for the January/February 2016 issue, which featured Pamela Anderson on its cover. \u201cThe question everyone will likely be asking is, \u2018Why?\u2019\u201d a statement in October said, announcing the change. \u201cPlayboy has been a friend to nudity, and nudity has been a friend to Playboy, for decades. The short answer is: times change.\u201d The publisher decided to return to business as usual after finding that while \u201cno nudes\u201d permitted greater ability to display the magazine on newsstands, it did not offset a fall in subscription sales. \u201cI said when they dropped the nude spreads it would be a big mistake,\u201d said industry analyst Samir \u201cMr Magazine\u201d Husni. \u201cNudes were the brand, so if one day you remove them, then you technically kill the brand image. Playboy with no nudes was an oxymoron. So this is a step in the right direction.\u201d Using the marketing headline \u201cNaked is normal\u201d, Hefner called the return of naked women a \u201cremarkably special moment personally and professionally\u201d. In an essay titled The Playboy Philosophy, Hefner insisted many had missed his father\u2019s original intention \u2013 \u201cto promote a healthy conversation about sex while also encouraging dialogue on social, philosophical and religious opinions\u201d. He claimed that \u201cmany misinterpreted that message or missed it entirely\u201d. Under his new Playboy philosophy, the magazine would be \u201cswinging back to tradition\u201d. It is reported that the new issue displays breasts and butts, but not full frontal nudity that had typified the publication over most of its 63-year existence. The new issue would feature Scarlett Johansson, Van Jones and Run the Jewels, along with several nude playmates, including Scarlett Byrne, who writes on the importance of owning female sexuality and the double standards that still exist between women and men. In addition to nudes, the re-imagined magazine will include old elements, including ribald \u201cparty jokes\u201d and a \u201cheritage\u201d section of vintage spreads. Husni believes the return of naked women may allow Playboy to reclaim some of its former self. \u201cAs a brand will it ever go back to having a 7 million circulation? No it cannot. It needs innovation not renovation. With Hugh on the way out, and under the creative leadership of Cooper, it will have a better chance to succeed, and to introduce an new idea of what it could be.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
