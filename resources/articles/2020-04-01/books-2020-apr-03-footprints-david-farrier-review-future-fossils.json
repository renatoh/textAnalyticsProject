What fossil traces will post-industrial human civilisation leave behind for the future to find? Roads and vast cities, long abandoned and forgotten, will show up as layers in the geological strata; our buried radioactive waste will still be deadly; our throwaway plastic will persist until eventually \u201cover the coming millennia, hydrocarbons leach from the fossil plastic, accumulating in small deposits and setting in motion a slow chemical return\u201d to its origins as oil. Future archaeologists may comment on the dreary sameness of our collective biomass: almost all of it Homo sapiens, along with the few species we like to eat. Which future archaeologists would those be, by the way? Sometimes Farrier is addressing human generations to come; at other times he\u2019s thinking on timescales longer than any species is likely to last, let alone ours with its over-sophistication and bad habits. One microbiologist fantasises that some day a \u201ccommune of evolved bees\u201d will encourage bee-scientists to study the Anthropocene as \u201ca warning for all hive-kind\u201d. The transience of what appears indestructible has been a rich theme in poetry and story. The mists shift on a bleak hillside in Kurosawa\u2019s Throne of Blood, where bloody Cobweb Castle is visible, now vanished and forgotten; Saxons write poems about stumbling on the ruins of Roman Aquae Sulis; Batman chases villains round the fallen grandeur of Gotham City. Farrier\u2019s argument is nuanced slightly differently, channelling our contemporary angst. It\u2019s not only that our way of life is transient. Our heedless interventions in the life of the planet \u2013 herding, ploughing, planting, building, mining, smelting, processing, communicating \u2013 have degraded its complexity and beauty in ways that will long outlast us, leaving their ineradicable taint. \u201cWe live in the shadow of an eclipse that will endure perhaps as many as ten million years before sound, shape and colour return in full to the land and the oceans.\u201d The climate and ecological crisis hurts us: and not only materially, physically. It hurts in the imagination, in the stories we tell. An idea of nature\u2019s boundlessness, the recurring seasons, the ocean\u2019s endless renewal \u2013 vaster than we are and cruelly, consolingly indifferent to us \u2013 has salved our private and public despairs, perhaps often almost unconsciously, through plagues and floods and wars, tragic ending after tragic ending. I remember the happiness I felt when we were shown black and white slides, in school, of the equatorial forest \u2013 much too long ago for any warning that it was threatened. My happiness didn\u2019t make me want to go there; I just needed it to be there. Nature holds together our sense of being, organically, at the root; and it\u2019s therefore in the roots of our language. We didn\u2019t know how fundamental our trust was in \u201cthe treasure of nature\u2019s germens\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s Macbeth invoking chaos \u2013 until news came that the treasure after all couldn\u2019t be counted on. And therefore the language and style in which we address the crisis are all-important. Obviously there\u2019s a first responsibility for the words to produce effects: an urgent need to change minds, change governance, change practices. And then alongside that there\u2019s the other responsibility that words have: to put up their supple resistance to stupidity and ugliness and evil, so that our consciousness of what\u2019s at hand has form, and we can bear it. There\u2019s a fascinating chapter in Farrier\u2019s book on two contrasting approaches to burying nuclear waste. How can we warn the far future not to dig where we\u2019ve put it, when we know that the future won\u2019t understand our language? Near Carlsbad, New Mexico, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant has devised a scheme that sounds like a computer game: \u201cFive levels of warning messages, rising in complexity, and a mix of monoliths, buried clues and archives \u2026 accompanied by faces of disgust and repulsion, modelled on Edvard Munch\u2019s The Scream \u2026 A thirty foot earthen berm, studded with magnets and radar reflectors to signal an anomaly, will enclose the inner ring of granite markers.\u201d In Finland meanwhile, they\u2019ve decided that \u201cgiven the long lifespan\u201d of their nuclear waste repository on Olkiluoto island \u2013 it will probably be buried at some point under another ice age \u2013 \u201cit would be foolish to try to mark it\u201d. They will \u201cbury the waste in specially designed copper canisters; backfill the hole; and retreat, without leaving a single trace aboveground\u201d; it\u2019s meant to be forgotten. This difference, too, feels like a choice about language; it\u2019s aesthetic as well as practical. Only one of those options is in good taste. Farrier\u2019s book is full of fascinating things, yet doesn\u2019t in its totality work for me. Its central conceit, to begin with \u2013 that idea of viewing, in some unimaginably distant future, the fossils left behind by our Anthropocene \u2013 feels strained because such a future is indeed impossible to imagine. The very terms of our love for our planet will no doubt turn out in deep time to be so much stardust \u2013 or carbon, or whatever; we can\u2019t begin to know in what ways our depredations might matter, on the timescale proposed here. No doubt Farrier wants the future-fossil idea to work as a rhetorical device, reminding us of the sheer size of our disaster now; but the harder he works to conjure the geological scale of the problem, the more tempting it is for his language to become vatic and sententious. \u201cFragments of artificial glass will be glazed with cataracts, like glaucomatous eyes staring blindly into the dark.\u201d Farrier\u2019s a literary critic and not a scientist, and the book is intended for a lay readership; but there just isn\u2019t room here to begin to lay out the complexities of these diverse scientific disciplines. A reader might finish his chapter on jellyfish convinced that they\u2019re taking over the sea (\u201cthe ocean\u2019s one lonely god will be frilled and eyeless, drifting placidly and implacably through its vast, empty dominion\u201d), but ocean scientist Juli Berwald, in her book Spineless, resists any certainty even as to whether jellyfish numbers are on the rise. Each \u201cecosystem in the ocean\u201d, she writes, \u201chas its own unique characteristics, with distinctive vulnerabilities, threats, and resiliences\u201d. A reader can\u2019t conceivably do justice to the chunks of science in Footprints: the account of lateral gene-swap transfer, for instance, or palaeoclimatologists\u2019 varying theses of the rhythms of ice ages. An uninitiated eye can only glide over Farrier\u2019s summaries, taking what\u2019s there on trust and adding it on to the mounting heap of glum. \u201cThe shadows are racing onwards \u2026 life is collapsing into darkness and silence.\u201d It\u2019s not that there isn\u2019t plenty to be glum about: glum, anxious, desperate even. We have to hope to turn this stinking, filthy tanker of our civilisation around: do something globally, for the first time ever, for our collective good. Not easy. And things won\u2019t ever all be all right again anyway, or all pristine, even at the best \u2013 they never were. Nature itself isn\u2019t pristine, that\u2019s a fallacy that belongs with the dream of original sin. If it\u2019s the right moment for jeremiads, though, let\u2019s at least have scorching ones, and not the lyric soulfulness of an admonitory headteacher. \u201cBehold, mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground: and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched\u201d (Jeremiah VII, 20). \u2022 Footprints: In Search of Future Fossils by David Farrier is published by 4th Estate ."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
