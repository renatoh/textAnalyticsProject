This is how the Turkish people remember Souey... Celtic and Rangers? Newcastle and Sunderland? As footballing rivalries go, little compares to heated steam bath of an atmosphere which accompanies the Istanbul derby between Galatasaray and Fenerbahce. Consider, as an example, the 1996 Turkish Cup final - the first time the two had met in the final in more than 30 years - which ended in a full-scale riot. The reason? Graeme Souness. It was 1-1 on aggregate in the return leg at Fener with a penalty shootout looming. But then, after 206 minutes of football, Dean Saunders got on to the end of a hopeful cross from the left to larrup an unstoppable shot on the bounce into the roof of the net. Four minutes later, the final whistle went and Souness set off for the Galatasary end. He relieved a fan of an eight-foot high flag, like waving a red rag to Istanbul, he paraded it to the centre of the pitch and speared it erect in the centre-circle. It was a dagger in the heart of Fenerbahce fans and the ultimate incitement to riot. They duly obliged. Souness, pelted with bottles of water, had to beat a hasty retreat as angry Fenerbahce fans tried to force the dressing-room door. The flag was quickly kicked over by supporters, and the cup presentation by President Suleyman Demirel could barely be seen for police riot shields held up to beat away fireworks and other missiles. \"We were all on the victory podium collecting our medals but after that we were being pelted with all sorts of things and we needed a police escort to get out,\" recalls then Gala goalkeeper Brad Friedel, flinching with the memory. \"They are still selling T-shirts of that incident in Turkey.\" \"You can go f*** your mother with the cup,\" chanted the crowd. Truncheon-wielding police sent alsations in to the stands, armoured cars bulldozed angry fans who mobbed the ground's main entrance, the windows of both team coaches were smashed, three people were wounded in knife attacks and even President Demirel was assaulted. \"I think Souness thought he was making Turkey a colony of Britain and, if he'd done that in Scotland or England, I don't think the hooligans there would have let him out alive,\" said Fenerbahce president Ali Sen, shaking his fist angrily and bearing his teeth. \"Flags should only be planted in Antarctica or on mountain summits!\" Souness feigned innocent bemusement. \"Pah, it's a quaint English custom, we do it all the time,\" he said before reeling off a catalogue of examples. \"I can't understand why the Fener fans reacted so strongly.\" The ambassador's reception was so bad that Souness was sacked at the end of his only season at the club. Hmm. Now read this preview of this afternoon's match while I get myself together. 1: A fairly non-descript start. The stadium is packed to its 20,000 capacity and they're all whistling already for some reason. About 200 of those fans are believed to be from Blackburn. \"Can you enlighten me on how the name of the team Genclerbirligi are playing is pronounced?\" asks Mark Judd. Yes, it is pronounced Blackburn (as in Tony) and Rovers (as in Return). \"And please confirm, for those idiots who think otherwise, that The Guardian does send its intrepid reporters to the ground itself.\" Yup, the paper does send reporters to the game. But in this office we watch it on the tellybox with a cuppa. How else would I be able to tell you that John \"after 90 minutes of sheer hell\" Barnes is the new Channel 5 football anchorman? 3: Like Bernard Manning at an anti-Nazi rally, Dwight Yorke goes down badly. Hefty challenge, that. \"Marvellous! Something to get me through the last hour and a bit of the day,\" says Dominic Smith. \"I pity you though Mr. Rookwood as doubtless all your colleagues will sneak away to the pub at 5:01 once The Fiver has been written (hmmmm) leaving you in the office by yourself for the second half. I hope for your sake the American emails are enough to keep you entertained.\" Spread it around, James Gooding style. 6: David Thompson is growing a mullet. I bet it's that Latin love-lump Lorenzo Amoruso's influence. Not a lot else going on at the moment. 9: A huge let-off for Blackburn. Must be those kebabs. Ozkan can't get enough purchase on a free header five yards out and Brad Friedel is able to gather comfortably. 10: Matt Jansen tries to whip his foot around the ball from 25 yards out but, like Thompson's mullet, it curls away. 13: Youla, the top scorer in Turkey so far this season, is looking lively. As is his strike partner Ozkan. Again he manages to get a shot away, but it goes into the side netting. 17: Genclerbirligi, whose name I am having to cut and paste each time, have definitely started the brighter of the two sides. \"How about mentioning something positive about English and Turkish fans for a change?\" asks Ian Haslam. \"The BRFC lads arranged a 5-a-side with the Genclerbirligi lads and a good time was had by all. We got beat 4 - 2 but reckon we can build on that for the return leg.\" What's positive about getting turned over by another team, Ian? 19: Brett Emerton is crudely upended in full flow. Gresko has a crack from the resulting freekick but it curls five yards wide of Gokhan's righthand post. 22: Gresko needlessly gives away a corner under no pressure. Brad Friedel has a touch of the David Jameses as the cross comes in: big flap, no contact. But the ball runs out for a throw. 26: Tugay lines up a freekick which is risible and Genclerbirligi counter. My colleague Nick Harper wants to know how much a 'monkey' is. Do we have any mockneys reading? Actually, do we have anyone reading full-stop? 29: There's a flash of fright wig in the Blackburn area but Deniz is denied the opening goal by his own ineptitude. It really was the simplest of near-post headers. \"Yeah right, like the fiver gets finished at 5:01pm,\" says cynic Matt Kay. \"Isn't that when they start writing it?\" 31: Genclerbirligi surge forward and Skoko sends in a daisy-cutter from 30 yards which Friedel treats with the disdain it merits. 33: Sitter miss No3 - This time it's Serkan's turn to spurn an easy header. He hits the bar from almost underneath it. Blackburn could easily be three down. 36: Ozkan runs at the Blackburn defence. Amoruso sweeps the leg to give the Turkish side a freekick right on the edge of the area. The wall does it job and Rovers survive. 38: \"A monkey, as everyone knows, apart from you two, is \u00a3500,\" says Mark Judd. Which means I'll take you up on your offer, Ciaran Colgan: \"I'll get you one for 50 quid, no questions asked,\" he says. Bargain. 42: Genclerbirligi goal And what a goal! Friedel has to come out of his area to head the ball away from danger, but it is sent back over him first-time by the Australian Skoko. It was a lovely half-volley from fully 40 yards and it had been coming. 43: Genclerbirligi goal It could be all over Blackburn Rover. Two goals in a minute right before half-time. Youla looks to be offside. He miscontrols the ball initially. It's stabbed through to him by Deniz and Youla takes it first-time in the area. Nice finish. Graeme Souness is going ape. 45: Genclerbirligi keeper Gokhan goes off with a rib injury. And then everyone else goes off for their half-time cup of tea/hair dryer treatment from a Magnum PI lookalike. Half-time: \"What is John Barnes wearing today?\" asks Matt Kay. \"He has entertained with his bizarre choice of suits in the past.\" I wish I could tell you that it's a pink leopard skin affair, but sadly it's an uncharacteristically sombre back suit and white shirt combo. \"You could at least try and jazz it up a bit, I've another hour to pass here,\" says Damien Comisky. You can't polish a poo, Damien. But hopefully it'll be a better game in the second half. Another goal for the home side will kill this tie off. 46: Andrew \"oustanding\" Cole is on for Matt Jansen. He's puffing on an asthmatic's inhaler on the sideline. Presumably his own. Andrew, as he insists on being called now that he's more mature, never did bring out a follow up single, did he? Break it down... 47: Skoko stamps on Tugay's foot. We're getting lots of slo-mo pictures of the Genclerbirligi coach biting his finger nails. You see what material I have to work with Damien Comisky? 49: Thompson, his mullet bouncing behind him, gets to the by-line but his cross and poor and the substitute keeper gathers safely. 51: The keeper does not deal with Emerton's corner and spills the ball but Dwight Yorke cannot capitalise. Mark Cripps might be on to something: \"Can't you write some kind of program that will automate the Fiver ... your techies should be able to stop playing Warhammer for long enough to put something together. Just plug in all the usual gags, set the machine in motion to cut and paste from the news wires and watch as a brand-new Fiver generates. That way, you're all free to hit the pub at 5.01, jobs well done.\" Which would make a change. 55: \"Reading between the lines it looks like Amoruso is having one of his typically terrible European days at the office,\" writes Graham Donnelly from Aberdeen. \"He used to make a habit of them at Rangers. Please confirm.\" You don't have to read between the lines. Just read this one: Lorenzo Amoruso is having a 'mare of Weston Super proportions. 57: Blackburn goal That really was outstanding from Andrew Cole. With his back to goal and two defenders on him, he span off one and flicked it past the other before drawing the keeper and laying off to Emerton who fired home with some aplomb. 60: Genclerbirligi goal In case I didn't make myself clear earlier, Graham Donnelly, allow me to rephrase. Lorenzo Amoruso is rubbish. Youla saunters through on to a bread-and-butter ball over the top. Amoruso watches him run past, gives him a little pat of encouragement, and then takes up a prime viewing position splayed out on the ground just behind him to watch the striker stroke it past Friedel and all but knock Blackburn out of Europe in the first round. 63: There isn't much skin left on Amoruso. Youla has taken most of it off. The striker turns him again in the centre circle, leaving the Italian on his sizeable backside again. Youla charges forward and is within a bad pass of putting Ozkan in for number four. 65: A David Thompson freekick evades everyone and skids through to the keeper who saves it by sitting on it. 67: Dino Baggio, who was so anonymous I didn't even know he was playing, has gone off for Steven Reid. Dwight Yorke, who was so poor he may as well have not been playing, has gone off for Grabbi. 71: \"I am in the throes of working out my notice so am scanning every (well those my IT dept have not firewalled) web site (guilt-free) for some form of amusement,\" writes Nick Stockley. You've come to the wrong place, Nick. Do something reckless then email us about it. Go on, man! Follow Amoruso's lead! He seems to be doing everything he can to get himself sacked. 74: Blackburn are going for it now. Steven Reid bursts into the area, but then takes a Pires and is lucky not to be booked for his trouble. \"You're sure you can't polish a poo?\" asks Damien Comisky. \"Have you tried?\" This is dirty talk. 80: There's loads happening and so on and so forth etc., but I'm just having a breather, letting it all unfold around me. Lorenzo has got it sussed, I reckon. 83: Blackburn have got seven minutes to score another crucial away goal and rescue this tie. Babbel is caught in possession on the edge of his area and almost lets Saka in for another goal. 85: A hit-and-hope punt from our Eurosceptic Amoruso is headed on by a nameless defender and into Grabbi's path. The striker swings a boot and puts the ball about 40 yards over the bar with impressive force. 87: Deniz, he of the fright wig, kicks Emerton up in the air in the D. Thompson, he of the Hoxton mullet, send his freekick on to the roof of the net. 90: Three minutes of added time. I'm not sure Lorenzo does overtime. At least he won't have to put himself out playing loads of extra European football this season. 90+2: Thompson juggles the ball and sends a dipping volley over the bar to a soundtrack of three peeps from the referee's whistle. That's it, folks. As far as Blackburn are concerned anyway."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
