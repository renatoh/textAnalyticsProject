His every sentence spiked with schadenfreude, Hull's manager delighted in expanding on a belief that every step forward taken by his former employers is invariably followed by two more in the reverse direction. \"Sunderland were flying but, in my experience with the club, there's always something around the corner,\" said Bruce, who was sacked by the Wearsiders in November 2011. \"OK, they won the derby at Newcastle 3-0 last week and they've got to a cup final, but what's going to happen next? Is that typical Sunderland? Is that the history of Sunderland? There will be more managers sacked here.\" Substitute the word \"history\" with \"destiny\" and more pessimistic season-ticket holders might be inclined to agree with their old boss. Even those convinced that Poyet's patient passing game represents the key to eventually breaking the cycle of what Glenn Hoddle once termed \"pigs and troughs\" know that, in the short term, relegation remains a real possibility. With Premier League visits to Manchester City and Arsenal looming, it seems likely that Sunderland will be back in the bottom three when they City at Wembley for the Capital One Cup final on 2 March. It might have very been different had Wes Brown not been sent off for a professional foul on Shane Long in the third minute. Albeit ill-advisedly, Brown \u2013 the recipient of three red cards this season, although one was rescinded \u2013 resorted to such a desperate measure due to Phil Bardsley's negligent concession of possession. Bardsley's slapdash pass not only found Long, who proceeded to cleverly draw Brown into a challenge on the edge of the area, but proved emblematic of Sunderland's apparently in-built inconsistency and frequently wild erraticism. Poyet's attempts to instil stability are hindered by a shortage of prolific strikers. With Steven Fletcher sidelined by an achilles injury that could yet require surgery and Ignacio Scocco still coping with the culture shock of swapping South America's summer for Wearside's winter, Jozy Altidore is leading Sunderland's attacking line. A \u00a36.5m summer buy from AZ Alkmaar, Altidore \u2013 once of Hull \u2013 has scored one Premier League goal all season and never looked like adding to that tally on a day when Long and Nikica Jelavic justified Bruce's \u00a314m January gamble by scoring a goal each. \"I've always said you're only as good as your strikers and our two new ones are very good,\" said Hull's manager after seeing a header apiece from his twin strike force seal victory. His goalkeeper did not disagree. \"Buying Shane and Nikica has been a huge, huge statement from the club,\" Steve Harper said. \"The bottom half of the table is very tight but the board going out and getting those two quality, proven players in January has given us a great chance of survival.\" Adam Johnson's chances of boarding England's World Cup flight to Brazil were supposed to have been boosted by a sparkling performance in front of Roy Hodgson, but the England manager's rare trip to the north-east was rendered rather pointless after the tactical rejig necessitated by Brown's dismissal. Minded with quiet efficiency by the specially deployed former Sunderland midfielder David Meyler, the highlight of Johnson's afternoon involved him directing a volley straight at Harper. Hodgson quite possibly liked the look of both Tom Huddlestone and Jake Livermore in the visiting central midfield but, again, this was hardly the day to judge them properly. \"Maybe Roy needs to come back and see Adam in a normal game, not an accident,\" said Poyet, whose gloom contrasted markedly with Bruce's bonhomie. \"We've done the double over Sunderland,\" pointed out Hull's manager. \"Ha, ha.\" Man of the match Shane Long (Hull City)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
