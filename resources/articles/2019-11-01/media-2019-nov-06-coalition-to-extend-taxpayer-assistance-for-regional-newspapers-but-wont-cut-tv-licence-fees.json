At a doorstop after the regional media symposium on Wednesday, the communications minister said that licence fees are \u201cvery low indeed\u201d and noted media companies were already taking advantage of 2017 changes that watered down cross-media ownership laws. Earlier, Fletcher said the government wanted to see how the current round of media consolidation would \u201cplay through\u201d, resisting pressure from Prime Media to abolish the one-to-a-market rule. The rule prevents regional TV mergers by stipulating that one company must not be able to exercise control of more than one commercial television broadcasting licence in a licence area. Fletcher told reporters in Wagga Wagga that the one-to-a-market rule had been in place for almost 40 years and despite \u201csome advocacy\u201d for its abolition Prime had already submitted a plan to merge with Seven. \u201cThere have been major changes to media regulation, we are seeing media organisations respond; and what we need to do is look at the totality of the policy issues that this raises,\u201d he said. In its digital platforms inquiry, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission recommended the government restructure regional media grants, after criticisms that the first round of \u201cinnovation\u201d grants were too restrictive, and to make donations to not-for-profit organisations engaging in public-interest journalism tax-deductible. Industry participants on Wednesday were told to expect a response \u201cwithin weeks\u201d, as communications department officials confirmed the intention to respond by the end of the year. In the forum, tensions between traditional media and social media evident in submissions to the ACCC played out again. News Corp Australia\u2019s group executive of corporate affairs, policy and government relations, Campbell Reid, accused Google of undermining the revenue model of traditional media, which Google\u2019s representative rejected. Fletcher told reporters in Wagga Wagga it was \u201cimportant to think about the distinctive transition changes and challenges that are faced by regional newspapers in going digital\u201d. Fletcher said that while industry had made \u201csome very constructive suggestions\u201d he believed any program the government introduced should channel philanthropic support \u201cin a consistent fashion to further support any program that government has in place\u201d. The comments suggest government support for media will continue to be targeted at regional areas rather than allow tax deductions to support public interest journalism at large. After negotiating a $60m package to support independent and regional publishers in return for his support, then senator Nick Xenophon accused the Coalition of \u201cblind ideology\u201d for the decision to exclude foreign-owned publishers from grants, even for hiring Australians for local reporting. The regional and small publishers jobs and innovation package delivered just $3.6m in its first round of grants although a further $9m was delivered in October after \u201cinnovation\u201d criteria were relaxed. The forum discussed shifting to a more direct stream of subsidies for regional media, a proposal supported by the Country Press Association. Paul Patrick, the head of content, strategy and development at Prime Media, argued against subsidies in favour of greater deregulation of ownership rules. Labor\u2019s shadow communications spokeswoman, Michelle Rowland, said the government needed a \u201ccoherent plan to support regional media in the public interest, rather than an ideologically-motivated scheme that excludes publishers like the Guardian and does favours for Liberal chums\u201d. \u201cThe poorly conceived regional and small publishers jobs and innovation package was foisted on industry by government after Nick Xenophon sold out Australian media diversity for a handful of beans,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cSince then, only a fraction of the fund has been allocated and the ACCC has recommended it be replaced.\u201d Fletcher noted the forum also heard details of the British model to locate journalists in BBC newsrooms around the country and to provide their stories to other local media outlets, a form of government support also being trialled in New Zealand through New Zealand On Air."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
