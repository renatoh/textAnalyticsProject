I was coaching Wasps that day seven years ago. Then, like now, Toulouse were the cup holders, whereas we had lost our opening two pool matches and had no chance of making the knockout stage. It was one of those matches when everything we did came off. The score would suggest Toulouse had fielded a weakened side, but they were the group leaders and had the incentive of a home tie in the quarter-finals. The final will be compelling. Wasps got themselves back on track with a surprisingly easy win over Northampton in the Premiership play-off semi-final having been beaten at home by Leicester the previous week, and Toulouse may need to win to ensure they are in the Heineken Cup next season after making a poor start in the French league play-offs. The main difference between French and English club rugby will be seen on the bench. France does not have a salary cap and teams can afford to have squads, rather than XVs, rippling with international players. Toulouse will have more options than Wasps when it comes to substitutions and they like to use all 20st of their No8 Isitolo Maka to make a second-half impact. As a director of rugby, the salary cap in England is a pain because you have to operate within a limit and there are times when you cannot sign the players you want. That said, the state of our game is still such that we cannot afford to be without it because some clubs would go out of business trying to keep up with big spenders. The French game does not need a cap because grounds there are all maintained by local authorities. Last year Perpignan had a new stand built and it did not cost them a single euro. Money generated by the game goes into salaries; in England the pot has to stretch that much further. Having a salary cap does add stability. Montferrand, who face Harlequins in the Parker Pen Challenge Cup final on Saturday, are releasing 12 players having failed to make an impact in the French league. The price of failure there is high. Wasps have every bit as strong a first XV as Toulouse, but because of the difference in quality on the respective benches they will need to be in front after an hour. Armed with a cushion, they should be able to withstand any late onslaught, but I would not fancy them chasing the game in the final quarter. The fact that the final is at Twickenham will be an advantage to Wasps. French clubs are not renowned for their performances away from home but they will look to put pressure on in the scrum and exploit the absence of the experienced prop Craig Dowd. The key player for me is Wasps' second-row Simon Shaw, a forward who has everything. If he was not playing, Toulouse would be the favourites: instead he shores up the scrum, stops driving lineouts and is everywhere in the loose. Wasps face two finals in seven days with Bath waiting in the Premiership grand final, and while it has been a long season for most of their players, tiredness will not be a factor. They are chasing a renowned double and they will be on the edge. What I am surprised about is that England, along with the other home unions, are touring this summer. They are not reciprocating visits because last year's World Cup meant there were no November internationals, and I would have thought it was in everyone's interests to give all the leading players some time off this summer. The southern hemisphere players had a two-month break after the World Cup, but our guys are being denied for reasons which are not easy to understand. A lot is being asked of players and this is an issue which needs to be looked at. There will be no resting on laurels in either of the weekend's finals. The Parker Pen is a secondary tournament, but carries the great prize of Heineken Cup qualification and is fiercely competitive from the quarter- final stage. Wasps won it last year and the team which finished at the top of the Premiership, Bath, were knocked out in this year's semi-finals. Harlequins are not that far away from Wasps and the potential is there for an English double."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
