A pair of his swimming trunks have become one of the most searched for menswear items, according to website Lyst in its quarterly report ranking fashion\u2019s hottest brands and products. Their popularity \u2013 4,000 searches and counting \u2013 may surprise some; the aquatic design by French luxury label Vilebrequin (featuring several lilac octopuses intertwined against a lighter background) is 1% \u201cAhoy Agenda\u2019\u201d and 99% \u201cDad, you\u2019re embarrassing me\u201d. Bezos was pictured in the trunks aboard David Geffen\u2019s yacht (supporting cast: supermodel and Taylor Swift\u2019s ex-bff Karlie Kloss, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein) and strolling around Saint Tropez with girlfriend Lauren Sanchez (credits: So You Think You Can Dance, regular on People magazine\u2019s Hot Bodies list). \u201cBezos\u2019s outlandish octopus shorts, ideal for cavorting on a superyacht, make a real statement,\u201d Lyst\u2019s Katy Lubin says. \u201cThe look has resonated with shoppers who, no doubt, aspire to Bezos\u2019s bold choices in both swimwear and in business.\u201d Dressing like \u201cone of the 1%\u201d is part of the growing trend for luxury global traveller style. Featuring the likes of Bottega Veneta leather sliders, Loewe beach mats and a kaftan from Marrakshi Life, it\u2019s a look straight out of a Bond villain\u2019s Instagram story. \u201cThe whole holiday, resort and travel area of menswear has been growing steadily,\u201d says Fiona Firth, buying director at Mr Porter. She adds that, along with Vilebrequin, sales of luxury swimwear by Off-White and Orlebar Brown have soared. \u201cI think men now understand and appreciate a broader perspective on dressing in different climates and for different occasions \u2013 it\u2019s not just about a pair of swimshorts,\u201d says Damien Paul, head of menswear at Matchesfashion.com. This focus on Bezos\u2019s holiday clothes comes at an interesting point in the conversation around men\u2019s workwear. Long rejected by Silicon Valley\u2019s so-called tech bros, such as Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, the traditional office suit is showing signs of decline, with Marks &amp; Spencer announcing that it is cutting back on its production, citing a 7% fall in sales. As Will Welch, editor-in-chief of GQ Style, announced in an editorial earlier this year: \u201cSilicon Valley rejected the suit as a symbol of a whole global infrastructure that needed disrupting. The corporate world abandoned it too.\u201d In its place? A look that\u2019s characterised by \u201cstealth, low-key luxury utility pieces\u201d says Lyst\u2019s Lubin. The centrepiece of that is the gilet \u2013 or \u201ctech vests\u201d as they have come to be known. At the 36th Allen &amp; Company Sun Valley conference earlier this year (the so called \u201cbillionaire summer camp\u201d where mega-deals are made) media alphas such as Bezos, Lachlan Murdoch and Hank Crumpton all wore theirs. They are the go-to look for the financial sector, parodied in more than one Instagram account and worn by characters on HBO shows Silicon Valley and Succession. Luxury brand Moncler even brought out a version knowingly named a \u201cbanker gilet\u201d. \u201cThe gilets have transitioned from being just a practical garment to a fashion item too,\u201d says Firth. \u201cTo meet customer demand we\u2019ve nearly doubled the amount of styles available.\u201d Sadly, you\u2019re probably going to be left wanting if you\u2019re planning on nabbing a pair of Bezos\u2019s Vilebrequin trunks for Christmas. They are largely sold out, but you can swipe a similar pair for a cool \u00a3185 \u2026 on Amazon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
