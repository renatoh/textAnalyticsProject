Mo Besic, on loan at the Riverside from Everton and the game\u2019s outstanding performer, scored one and assisted the other, but Wednesday\u2019s Tom Lees was the true source of what proved the decisive second goal. Tony Pulis\u2019s side made a bright start, pressing the Wednesday defenders in the final third, but it was the home side who fashioned the first chance when Barry Bannan clipped a left-wing cross on to the head of the former Middlesbrough midfielder Adam Reach, whose effort brushed the crossbar. While the visitors continued to dominate territory and possession, they were creating little and there was just a minute of the first half remaining when the first shot on target arrived, Wednesday\u2019s goalkeeper, Cameron Dawson, easily fielding Besic\u2019s effort. Middlesbrough began the second half with purpose and within four minutes they led through a goal of a quality out of keeping with that seen beforehand. Stewart Downing\u2019s back-heel sent Jonny Howson racing down the right wing and he pulled the ball back to Besic, who drove a low shot across Dawson and into the far corner. Within minutes the lead was doubled after a dreadful mistake from Lees. The defender\u2019s backpass was woefully short and Besic latched on to the loose ball before drawing Dawson and squaring for Britt Assombalonga to tap into the open goal. It took Wednesday 68 minutes to muster an effort on target, the substitute Atdhe Nuhiu heading straight at Darren Randolph, but they hauled themselves back into the game in spectacular fashion with eight minutes left. Bannan floated a free-kick into the visitors\u2019 penalty area and Reach met the partial clearance with a sweetly struck right-foot volley into the left-hand corner from 20 yards. In the fourth minute of stoppage time there was an almighty scramble on the Middlesbrough goalline after a corner but Boro held on to the points."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
