The 28-year-old Henson has indicated he is ready to return after taking an unpaid sabbatical, although the official line taken by the Ospreys yesterday was that as they had not heard directly from the player, their view was that nothing had changed and that he remained on indefinite unpaid leave until they were otherwise notified. If Henson returns next season, it would be one year before the World Cup, which is being held in New Zealand, a tournament in which he has never played. \"I think that is his motivation,\" said the Wales coach, Warren Gatland. \"We want him to put himself in contention for Wales because he is such a fantastic player. I would love to see him back.\" The Ospreys this month entered into an agreement with London Welsh which will lead to an exchange in players, raising the prospect of Henson feeling his way back into the game at Old Deer Park next September. \"We would be delighted if the Ospreys decided that Gavin needed a couple of months with us to regain his match fitness and sharpness,\" said the London Welsh managing director, John Taylor, who was in Swansea yesterday firming up details of the agreement as well as having talks with the Welsh Rugby Union. \"We would love to have him in London. The rules on loan players in the Championship are being tightened up next season but we will still be allowed three from outside the England academy. The tie-up with the Ospreys is exciting and will be beneficial to both clubs, but reports they are financing us are wrong: they have not taken out a shareholding or invested financially in any way.\" London Welsh want to use the link with the Ospreys to help their push for a place in the Premiership. Although they are on course to make the Championship play-off semi-final, promotion would almost certainly be denied them this season because they do not fulfil the entry criteria. They are in talks with Brentford Football Club about becoming partners in the proposed building of a new ground near Kew Bridge with a capacity of 22,000. The plan has a current shortfall of \u00a310m which the Exiles are looking to fill. \"Part of the talks with the Ospreys is how they went about building the Liberty Stadium and drawing up a business plan,\" said Taylor. \"Gone are the days when a club could confine its ambition to hovering around the middle of the first division. You end up losing money and our ambition is to get into the Premiership. \"We need to find a new ground because of the limited capacity at Old Deer Park and we have to make way every April to Richmond Cricket Club. We have had to play our last few matches at Esher and if we made the play-off final, we would look to play our home game at Harlequins. \"We hope to use Brentford's Griffin Park at the end of next season but going forward the project in Kew Bridge would be ideal and I would like to think that will happen in between three and five years. London Welsh is a famous club and we are aiming high again.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
