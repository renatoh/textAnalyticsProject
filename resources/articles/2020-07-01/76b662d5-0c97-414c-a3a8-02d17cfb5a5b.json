They are urging the government to make \u201clife-saving\u201d changes to the domestic abuse bill, which will be debated for its final stage in parliament on Monday. The Step Up Migrant Women coalition \u2013 a collection of more than 50 BAME specialist frontline services, migrant and human rights organisations including the Latin American Women\u2019s Rights Service, Southall Black Sisters and Amnesty International UK \u2013 has accused the government of leaving a \u201cgaping hole\u201d in the groundbreaking legislation, arguing that it will not provide any support for abused migrant women who have no recourse to public funds. \u201cThe decision to leave migrant women out of this bill sends the message that their lives are not valued, they are disposable, they are second-class people, they are invisible,\u201d said Pragna Patel, the director of Southall Black Sisters. Currently, domestic violence victims on spousal visas can access support for three months, but women on any other visa with a \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d stipulation cannot. \u201cWith this bill, the government isn\u2019t just invisibilising abused migrant women, it\u2019s worse than that,\u201d said Patel. \u201cIt knows they exist but it is deliberately choosing to ignore their needs.\u201d She said the issue had been brought up repeatedly with Victoria Atkins, the minister for safeguarding, who said more assessment of the situation was needed. The shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, Jess Phillips, has tabled an amendment proposing a pause on the no recourse provision for migrant victims who meet a legal aid test. \u201cThe argument the government uses is that these women should go home \u2013 and have their whole lives taken away by their abuser,\u201d said Phillips. \u201cIn these situations the state is continuing the threat of the perpetrator who says \u2018no one will believe you, you won\u2019t have anywhere to go and have no support\u2019 \u2013 and right now the abuser is absolutely right.\u201d Phillips argued that the bill also did not provide economic stability for community-based support services, although she welcomed a statutory duty on local authorities to provide support for victims in refuges. \u201cSpecialist services for black women or disabled victims and male victims are no better served than they were,\u201d said Phillips. \u201cThey will have new tools, but the funding decline in the specialised sector during years of austerity won\u2019t be abated by the bill.\u201d The bill also includes a statutory definition of domestic abuse and would establish a domestic abuse commissioner and create a new domestic abuse protection notice and domestic abuse protection order. Women\u2019s Aid is calling for an end to the presumption of contact in domestic abuse cases. \u201cWe know through our work that safeguarding concerns are often not believed or understood in the child contact system,\u201d said Sophie Francis-Cansfield, a senior campaigns and policy officer at the charity. \u201cWe need fundamental reform.\u201d Changes have already been made to the bill, including the addition of a clause to remove \u201cconsent for sexual gratification\u201d as a defence in court proceedings for causing serious harm, following an 18-month campaign by We Can\u2019t Consent To This. After a campaign led by the NSPCC, the bill will now explicitly recognise that children are victims of domestic abuse in their own right, and the bill has also been amended to guarantee survivors access to special measures such as screens and waiting rooms in all courts, and to expand a ban on abusers cross-examining their victims. Campaigners including Labour\u2019s Stella Creasy are continuing to push for an amendment that would lead to misogyny being treated by police as a hate crime. Agenda, the alliance for women and girls at risk, is calling for training for frontline professionals to be made mandatory. This would cost \u00a33.6m and would provide long-term savings, argued Agenda\u2019s chief executive, Jemima Olchawski. \u201cSimply asking the question in the right way is the first but crucial step. If followed up by appropriate support, it has the potential not only to change lives but to save them,\u201d she said. A spokesperson for the Home Office called the bill \u201ca game-changing piece of legislation that will transform how we deal with this horrific crime\u201d, adding that the government had announced \u00a376m to support victims of domestic abuse, sexual violence and modern slavery. Women\u2019s Aid estimates that \u00a3173m is required to create a comprehensive network of refuges."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
