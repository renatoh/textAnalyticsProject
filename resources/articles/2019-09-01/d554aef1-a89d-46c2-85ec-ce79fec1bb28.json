There is plenty of pace on the stands\u2019 side, however \u2013 Major Jumbo (20) should give them a good tow \u2013 and a big showing from the favourite cannot be ruled out. But the time of his most recent win was nothing special and Arecibo (3.50), at around 12-1 from stall 17, makes more appeal. Danny Tudhope\u2019s pick from David O\u2019Meara\u2019s four runners was less than a length behind Oxted in last weekend\u2019s Portland Handicap at Doncaster and he has winning form over track and trip. Newbury 1.45 Dakota Gold has stepped up to a new level this season at the age of five and his progress in four straight wins is backed up by the clock. A return to five furlongs holds no fears and a first win at Group level looks imminent. Ayr 2.00 Hortzadar finished in mid-division in the Irish Cambridgeshire last time but he was in the mix until the closing stages. David O\u2019Meara\u2019s gelding is still on a workable mark judged on his recent winning form at Ripon and a price of around 12-1 looks too big. Newbury 2.20 Desert Encounter is an obvious favourite with plenty of form at this level, but this small field with no obvious pace may not suit a horse that stays 14 furlongs. Pondus is the obvious alternative as he likes to be prominent, and has plenty of scope for improvement with only six races in the book so far. Ayr 2.40 A full field of 25 for the Silver Cup but two runners \u2013 Lahore and the three-year-old Alkaraama - dominate the betting. The latter has more scope for progress on only his seventh start, but Lahore is also lightly-raced for a five-year-old and put up his best run yet for Philip Makin when second at Thirsk last time. At the likely odds, he is the narrow pick. Newbury 2.55 Mystery Power was an impressive winner of the Superlative Stakes at Newmarket on his second start, but failed to back that up when beating only one opponent home in the Vintage Stakes. With hindsight, he was never going to beat Pinatubo but Pierre Lapin could prove to be another very strong opponent here. He registered a very strong time for a debutant at Haydock in May and is still entered for both the Middle Park and Dewhurst. Ayr 3.15 Orlaith took a step up in class in her stride last time when beating Al Raya, a winner next time out, by three-quarters of a length and can make further progress here. Newbury 3.30 Forest Of Dean is 5lb worse off with Johnny Drama having beaten him by one-and-a-half lengths at York last time. In theory, that gives Andrew Balding\u2019s runner every chance of reversing the form but the bare numbers do not take account of the ease of Forest Of Dean\u2019s success. He had plenty left at the line and his rise in the weights looks fairly modest in the circumstances."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
