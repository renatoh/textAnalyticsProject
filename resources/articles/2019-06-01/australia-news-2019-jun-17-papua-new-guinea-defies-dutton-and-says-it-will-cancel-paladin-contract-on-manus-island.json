The $423m contract with Paladin, which is currently being scrutinised by the national audit office, expires in less than two weeks, and the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, indicated on Sunday it would likely be extended. But PNG\u2019s immigration minister, Petrus Thomas, has said his government expects to \u201ccancel or terminate\u201d the contract by the end of June, and that the chief migration officer had written to Australia\u2019s home affairs department. \u201cPNG government wants a transparent tender process and most importantly will strongly recommended national content,\u201d he said. \u201cPapua New Guinean companies now have the capacity and expertise to do the job and should be given the opportunity to participate.\u201d The PNG government was supposed to take over the running of services and facilities when the detention centre was closed in November 2017, however just before before the anticipated date it became apparent PNG was not ready to take over. After intense criticism of the contract and Paladin\u2019s performance, the Australian government said this rush prompted their use of a limited tender process to engage Paladin. It has been renewed several times since. Asked on Sunday if the contract would be renewed again in two weeks, Dutton said: \u201cthe likelihood is there\u2019s a continuation\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment when the department is in the process of the arrangements.\u201d The Australian government\u2019s contract with Paladin Holdings stipulates that the department has \u201cabsolute discretion\u201d to extend the contract for up to 12 months twice, but it must give six weeks notice to the company. It already extended the contract in September and December 2018. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said Labor was aware of PNG\u2019s concerns and would be questioning the government over the Paladin contract in the next round of Senate estimates. He criticised the suggestion the contract would be renewed \u201cwithout any process\u201d. \u201cThe fact is that Peter Dutton stuffed this up the first time,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cHe had a chance to make it a bit better and what he\u2019s doing is just digging further into the hole. The problem is the taxpayers are paying for that fiscal hole. There are still around 800 refugees and asylum seekers on the two offshore sites \u2013 Manus Island and Nauru. On Sunday, Dutton said about 530 people had been resettled in the US under a deal struck between the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and the then US president, Barack Obama, to take up to 1,250. Dutton said he did not expect it would reach 1,250 but a few hundred people were currently being processed for resettlement. He said 95 people had withdrawn from consideration for US resettlement or rejected an offer. More than 300 had been rejected by US authorities and there remain a number of people, including Iranians, whose asylum claims have been rejected. Iran will not issue travel documents to people who are not returning voluntarily, and neither major party in Australia has a plan for what happens to them. PNG has long maintained that the memorandum of understanding makes them Australia\u2019s responsibility, but Australia has resisted this interpretation. Albanese also attacked the government on Monday over the shortfall in the US resettlement program, and the continued \u201cindefinite detention\u201d of people on Manus Island and Nauru. \u201cThe government are continuing to not settle people who\u2019ve now been in offshore processing for a very, very long time and yesterday Peter Dutton revealed that, in spite of the fact the deal with the US, a deal that Labor supported, to resettle 1,250 refugees in the United States, they\u2019re not going to get anywhere near that figure,\u201d he told media in Darwin. \u201cYou have offers from countries like New Zealand to participate and to assist in regional settlement, that the government has ignored. Peter Dutton\u2019s too obsessed by playing politics. He needs to stop playing politics and actually do his job.\u201d Labor\u2019s immigration policy is largely similar to the Coalition\u2019s but it has said it would accept New Zealand\u2019s offer to resettle 150 refugees from Manus Island and Nauru each year. It has also suggested it would do better at seeking other third-country options."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
