The second sees her announcing her potentially imminent suicide to her therapist: \u201cI\u2019m gonna kill myself in 180 days, if things don\u2019t get better.\u201d Work in Progress is not only McEnany\u2019s first TV series but it\u2019s the first time she\u2019s been on a professional set. And with this original, melancholic comedy, she is setting the bar high. Its autobiographical traits \u2013 McEnany plays \u201cAbby\u201d, and is a self-described \u201cfat, queer dyke\u201d \u2013 are nothing compared with its origins story, which is something out of a fairytale. \u201cThat\u2019s funny, because I often say that it\u2019s like a fairytale. It is legitimately my dream come true,\u201d says McEnany, calling from her Chicago apartment. At 51, she is the star, co-creator and co-writer of Work in Progress, which is quite the first TV gig. She is out of coffee, and warns me that some may be delivered as we speak. \u201cI\u2019m so embarrassed, dude! What an asshole move.\u201d Clearly, success has gone to her head. \u201cI mean honestly,\u201d she laughs. \u201cWhat a bougie bitch!\u201d McEnany moved to Chicago for college in 1986, and has been a mainstay of the city\u2019s improv and sketch comedy scene for years, eventually joining Second City\u2019s touring company when she was 40. Three years ago, she started a form of live storytelling at the iO Theatre, performing material she had written about her life. She called it Work in Progress. Her friend and co-creator Tim Mason was looking for material to direct, to build up his directing portfolio, saw the show, and suggested they work together on bringing it to screen. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019d always wanted to do. I\u2019m better at working with people. It helps me not get anxious. All that negative talk, that fatalism, that defeatism, is so easy when you\u2019re by yourself. Hold on.\u201d The coffee arrives. \u201cI\u2019m such a jerk! Anyway. I\u2019ve always wanted to do it, because I think there are not a lot of people like me in film or on TV.\u201d She does believe there are more and more different kinds of women on screen. She loves Orange Is the New Black, for example. \u201cYou see fat women and old women and queer women and butch women. That\u2019s who I am, right? Old, fat, butch, grey-haired. I\u2019m not trying to say I\u2019m the only one. But I would say, there are not a lot.\u201d Before Work In Progress became a series, she would go to auditions (she says she was \u201chorrible\u201d at it), but never booked a job. \u201cThey\u2019re not like, you can play a mom and sell fast food. They don\u2019t want to show fat people eating burgers. And that\u2019s in commercials. In TV shows, there\u2019s not a ton of people that are not the palatable people that America wants to look at.\u201d She mentions a joke she has with her friends. \u201cWhen guys dream of lesbians, they\u2019re not thinking of me,\u201d she laughs. The solution to her \u201cabysmal\u201d history of auditioning turned out to be right there in front of her. \u201cThat\u2019s why I thought, I\u2019ve got to write for myself.\u201d McEnany and Mason were considering turning their idea into a web series, but the pilot they had put together caused waves at Sundance in 2018; it was picked up for a full series by Showtime, and The Matrix co-creator Lilly Wachowski, whom McEnany had known for a few years, effectively came out of retirement to produce and co-write. The pieces had all fallen into place. \u201cSometimes Tim and I will be like, how did this happen?\u201d she says. \u201cTo have this amazing opportunity at 51 years old is just beautiful. I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d Then again, she reasons, it takes her time to build up the confidence in whatever it is she is doing. \u201cWhen I had my first real relationship, I was 29.\u201d She auditioned for Second City\u2019s touring company for 10 years before she got in. \u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things. I believe this wouldn\u2019t have happened in my 20s. It wouldn\u2019t have happened in my 40s.\u201d Much of the story of Work in Progress is about Abby, the character, finding opportunities to live, when she has just about given up hope. \u201cI think the story is really based on my life.\u201d What everybody wants to know, of course, is how much of it is true. \u201cNow, my answer is, it depends what time of day it is, and who\u2019s asking,\u201d McEnany laughs. \u201cEveryone has terrible moments, I\u2019m a human being, but I hope I\u2019m not as terrible.\u201d Instead, the truth comes from what she calls the \u201cmessiness\u201d of Abby. \u201cI have mental illness, I struggle with a bunch of stuff, I try to be an honest person and open, but it\u2019s scary. The character\u2019s been beaten down and has sworn off relationships and is struggling. I\u2019ve had times in my life where I\u2019m so depressed and stuck.\u201d Her parents first took her to therapy when she was in eighth grade. \u201cI had my first panic attack at five, and you don\u2019t have the words at five. When I started exhibiting OCD, it wasn\u2019t really in the lexicon like it is now. I was able to talk to my parents and they had the means for me to try therapy.\u201d She considers herself lucky that they were able to give her the care she needed. Comedy, she says, was everything. \u201cIt might sound hyperbolic, and I haven\u2019t had much coffee, but humour has saved my life, I think.\u201d Just before McEnany joined Second City, her mother died, following a long illness. \u201cHumour has gotten me through some really hard times. Some of the funniest moments that I\u2019ve had with my family are in that horrible three and a half years that my mom was dying. There was weirdly a lot of healing in that time.\u201d Work In Progress is a deft blend of wry pessimism and tenderness, particularly in its central love story between Abby and a younger trans man, Chris (The Politician\u2019s Theo Germaine). \u201cIt\u2019s based on a real-life romance that I had. I was actually just talking with my ex this morning, and they\u2019re coming to the premiere here in Chicago,\u201d she explains. As the couple\u2019s relationship begins, Chris takes Abby to a queer party. \u201cWhen I was writing it, I was like, this can be a queer wonderland. There\u2019s gonna be performances, art, sex toys, leather, and it\u2019s going to be this wonderful coming together of queerness and diversity and openness and expression. I define myself as a person as a sex-positive prude,\u201d she laughs. \u201cAnd this is such an opening of the character\u2019s eyes. Her whole life is opening up and other opportunities are coming to the fore, and Chris is the vehicle for that, for sure.\u201d Elsewhere, Saturday Night Live alumnus Julia Sweeney has a recurring role as herself. In the early 90s, Sweeney created the androgynous SNL character, Pat, largely based on the gag that nobody knew Pat\u2019s gender. \u201cOne of my stories in that storytelling show was that Julia Sweeney\u2019s Pat made my life a living hell,\u201d McEnany says. \u201cI was starting to wear a lot of overalls, I was masculine, big, fat \u2013 my weight fluctuates a lot \u2013 and people would be calling me Pat. And if you\u2019re called Pat, nobody\u2019s giving you a compliment.\u201d She remembers being in a lesbian bar in the late 90s, being called Pat. \u201cIt\u2019s like, wow, this is supposed to be a safe space and I\u2019m being judged for what I look like? It\u2019s hateful. Where do I get a break? It really defeated me.\u201d When the fictional Abby runs into Julia Sweeney in a bar, the shock of finally confronting her nemesis after so many years causes her to pass out. The real Julia Sweeney used to live in Chicago, and McEnany and Mason reached out to her through a mutual friend. \u201cShe was so supportive, she was on board from the very beginning. And she\u2019s been such a genuine joy,\u201d she says. Did it give her chance to readdress Pat herself? \u201cI think so. I love her openness about it. She had an opportunity, and we had an opportunity.\u201d In fact, they got on so well that when they were unsure whether Work in Progress would be picked up, Sweeney invited McEnany to live with her in Los Angeles. \u201cI cannot tell you how much I love her.\u201d Like McEnany, Work in Progress is a true original, and it marks the arrival of an important new voice. But there is one question left to answer. How close is she to bringing back \u201cwassup?\u201d \u201cOh man! I\u2019ve been working on that for about 10 years,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cI would say I\u2019ll start a change.org petition to get that back. But I haven\u2019t started it yet.\u201d Work in Progress starts on Showtime in the US on 8 December and in the UK at a later date"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
