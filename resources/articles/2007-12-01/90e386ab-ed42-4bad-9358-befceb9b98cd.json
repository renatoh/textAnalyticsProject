The move is being seen as a significant step in a likely handover of power that could occur as early as March, with the Cuban president possibly retaining an honorary role and title. \"My essential duty is not to cling to office nor to obstruct the rise of people much younger, but to pass on experience and ideas whose modest value arises from the exceptional times in which I lived,\" said the man who has led the country since the 1959 revolution, in a letter read out on national television. Castro, 81, has been in poor health since an operation in July last year. His brother, Ra\u00fal, 76, has been the acting president, but it was always felt that his role was temporary and that a younger person would take over in the long term. The current favourite for the post is Carlos Lage, the 56-year-old vice-president. In January an election will take place for the Cuban national assembly, which, in turn, will elect the president in March. That could be the time that a new leader emerges, just as the US is going through the process of choosing its own presidential candidates. \"This is a highly significant move by Castro,\" said Stephen Wilkinson, of the International Institute for the Study of Cuba at London Metropolitan University. \"By hinting that he would not wish to hinder younger people from coming forward, he has rather coyly invited the population to express their support for him. This in turn opens the way for a broader discussion about the one who might follow him.\" Wilkinson said he was in Cuba last week and found that generally opinion was that Castro was too frail to resume power and ought to step aside. However, until such an announcement \"that was not an opinion that could be easily expressed openly, since most people also respected that he had the right to make the choice\". Meanwhile, Lage is emerging as the likeliest successor. The vice-president, a paediatrician by profession, has overseen recent economic changes in Cuba, which have included the negotiations for oil from Venezuela, whose president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, is Castro's strongest supporter on the international stage. Other candidates whose names have been mentioned include Felipe P\u00e9rez Roque, 41, the foreign minister and Castro's former chief of staff, and Ricardo Alarc\u00f3n, the former ambassador to the UN and president of the national assembly. The vice-president of the national assembly, Jaime Crombet, told the Guardian last month that Castro was still intellectually strong but people in the country recognised that he could no longer carry the same workload as before. \"The main concern is that he does not come back before the right time and that he follows doctors' instructions,\" said Crombet. \"Maybe our major concern is that once he came back he would work with the same intensity.\" It is not expected that the Bush administration will alter its policy towards Cuba in the event of a change in leadership. Last month, the UN general assembly called, by a vote of 184 to four for the lifting of the US trade embargo of Cuba. The opposers in the vote were the US, Israel, Palau, and Marshall Islands, with Micronesia abstaining. Last week about 500 well-known Americans, including Gore Vidal, Sean Penn, Carlos Santana, Danny Glover, Ry Cooder, Harry Belafonte and Bonnie Raitt, called for the US to end its blockade."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
