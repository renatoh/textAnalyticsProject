It's always been a bit peculiar to associate the majority of celebrities with significant football ability - like imagining your teachers in flagrante - but a number were on the books of league clubs, or at least had trials with them, in their youth. Take Angus Deayton, who had a trial with Crystal Palace at the age of 12, or Luciano Pavarotti, who was put through his paces at Modena - even more improbably, he was a winger - while perma-tanned crooner Julio Iglesias was on the books of Real Madrid as a goalkeeper of some promise before a car crash in 1963 ended his career. Pope John Paul II, in the days before he supported Fulham, was a keeper with Polish team Wadowice, while Rik Waller was on the books of Liverpool as a youngster. OK, so we made that last one up. But here are some other bona fide triallists: David Essex (Leyton Orient) Des O'Connor (Northampton) Sir David Frost (Nottingham Forest) Mark Owen (Manchester United) Bradley Walsh (Brentford) Perry Fenwick (Leyton Orient) Ricky Tomlinson (Scunthorpe United) Mike Gatting (Arsenal) Audley Harrison (Watford) Got any to add? Email them to knowledge@theguardian.com I WANT IT ALL \"With Niall Quinn now the chairmanager of Sunderland, I wondered just how many other chairmen have held similar roles?\" asks Alex Duce. Ron Noades is one such example, Alex, following a spell with Brentford between 1998 and 2000. \"I wanted to manage. I wanted to decide myself who I wanted to buy, and the big advantage of doing both roles is that you speed up the process so much,\" he said recently. \"I could buy a player within 24 hours when other clubs were talking about sending out their chief scout to see them, after that the manager and then after that trying to persuade the chairman to buy him. While they were still poncing about, I'd bought him.\" His tenure ended bitterly, though, with the vast majority of Bees supporters still holding him in particularly low regard. Notoriously, Barry Fry spent nine years from 1996 to 2005 as chairmanager of Peterborough United, presiding over one promotion and two relegations. He is still chairman at London Road, but has retired from dancing dementedly down the touchline, leaving all that to Keith Alexander. Another famously shy and retiring type, Michael Knighton, fancied himself in the dual role, as James Coppard recalls. \"Having been promoted to the old Division Two, the club made a poor start to the 1997-98 season, and Knighton sacked fans' favourite Mervyn Day, putting himself in charge,\" he says. \"This wasn't as strange as it seems, as he did have a degree in physical education and had once been a teacher, so was obviously ideally qualified for the job. Sadly, despite this, Carlisle were relegated that season.\" Knighton's reign ended in December 1998, with his team having lost 37 of his 68 games in charge. Finally, in the world of non-league, Gavin Hudson reports that \"Dave Pace is currently both chairman and manager of Droylsden AFC\". Indeed, Pace has been owner and boss of the Bloods since 1998, steering the team into the Conference North. INAPPROPRIATE REFEREEING CONDUCT (PART TROIS) Forget Mike Reed celebrating a Liverpool goal. Cast aside drunk German ref Wolf-Dieter Ahlenfelder from your thoughts: they've got nothing on the cunning of one inventive Italian official, as our very own James Richardson explains. \"In a Napoli-Salernitana local derby in 1945, a referee named Stampacchia lost control of the match and faced a pitch invasion from a large a hostile crowd,\" he writes. \"At this, Signore Stampacchia wisely pretended to have been shot. A large and concerned crowd gathered around the fallen official's tragically supine form - at which point, tempers having cooled nicely, Stampacchia got back up and continued the game.\" KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE \"Can you settle a disagreement that I've started in my local?\" asked Dan Blandford in 2001. \"I set the questions for the weekly quiz and asked the following question: the 1986 Mexico World Cup was originally meant to be held in which South American country? Let me know your answer as mine was challenged by the rest of the pub!\" In 1974 Fifa awarded the 1986 World Cup to Colombia - but infrastructure and financial problems meant that by 1983 the country was struggling to meet its promises. Realising the prospects of a World Cup in Columbia were slim, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and the United States offered themselves as alternatives for the 1986 tournament. After Colombia were forced to drop out, Brazil decided they weren't interested in World Cup 86 after all. And so Fifa, faced with three competing bids, decided in May 1983 to reject Canada and the US in favour of Mexico. There was much outrage in the US about the decision. Henry Kissinger, the leader of the US bid, even petitioned Fifa for another chance, arguing that the 1986 tournament would revive the fading North American Soccer League (NASL). He was supported by Pele and Franz Beckenbauer - but Fifa's president Joao Havelange was singularly unimpressed. Fifa claimed their decision was down to logistics - the US bid included venues on the east and west coast, which meant increased travelling times and weary footballers. But the real reason was that they wanted to teach US football a lesson. In 1981, Fifa had threatened to outlaw the NASL and suspend the US Federation because the NASL had changed the offside line from halfway to 35 yards out and used a shoot-out to decide drawn matches. The NASL refused to back down - and even threatened legal action against Fifa. But what comes around goes around, and two years later Fifa got its revenge by rejecting Kissinger's bid. With the last hope of reviving the NASL gone, it folded before the start of the 1986 World Cup. For more classic Knowledge, click here. Can you help? \"Why are 'legs' in cup matches so called? Where did this term originate?\" wonders Andy Beill. \"There's a buzz in the local blogosphere that an Indonesian coin was used by Jack Taylor, the Englishman who refereed the 1974 World Cup final between Holland and West Germany.
