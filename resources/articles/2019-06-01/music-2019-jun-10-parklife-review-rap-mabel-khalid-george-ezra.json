The hurriedly reshuffled (and less popular) makeshift headliner Mark Ronson drops her Bodak Yellow into what is basically a DJ set of his hit productions. Rapper Dave displays a bandaged ankle and pointedly tells the crowd: \u201cI\u2019d do the show on crutches if I had to.\u201d Even the excellent, big-grinning, soul- and jazz-inspired hip-hopper Loyle Carner can\u2019t resist cheekily changing No CD\u2019s lyric to: \u201cWe spent all our money on Cardi B.\u201d Still, neither the star\u2019s non-appearance nor the heavy downpours truly dampen the Mudchester party vibes. The nine stages include the Temple (noisily curated by Chase &amp; Status on Saturday) and the colossal Hangar, which blasts dance music all day long. The music is markedly contemporary, so drum kits and guitars are almost as rare as audience members over the age of 21. Rap dominates Saturday\u2019s lineup. Earl Sweatshirt is thrilled by the opportunity to perform on a catwalk in the Sounds of the Near Future tent, yelling: \u201cIf you ever get chance to do this, take it!\u201d Advice noted. Gritty MC Slowthai makes full use of the stage prop, topping a storming set by running the length of the audience and returning without his trousers. Meanwhile, the seminal reggae DJ David Rodigan, who is 67, all but clears the main stage field. His silently received shout to the \u201cjunglist massive\u201d illustrates a generation gap, but the crafty old pro rescues the situation with the day\u2019s best quip: \u201cIf your mum was a junglist massive, this is for your mum.\u201d Parklife audiences like it in your face and banging, so Dave and AJ Tracey pull hordes but Christine and the Queens\u2019 sophisticated, choreographed, #MeToo-referencing electronic-pop masterclass \u2013 which clashes with Disclosure and Mark Ronson \u2013 is poorly attended. Still, she turns the challenge into a triumph. \u201cThis show is extra special because I can actually see all your faces,\u201d she gamely insists, playing to a sparsely populated but wildly cheering soggy audience as if it were a crowd at Stade de France. Sunday mixes things up, with huge crowds for Mabel\u2019s summery, Jamaican-tinged R&amp;B and massed croon-alongs for Khalid. Stockport quintet Blossoms \u2013 the closest thing to a guitar band \u2013 play their synth-driven, wistfully euphoric bangers under a quintessential northern drizzle, which turns into a monsoon. The bad weather prompts the Streets\u2019 Mike Skinner to claim, \u201cI have paid God for the sun\u201d \u2013 which magically appears minutes later. The revitalised MC\u2019s terrific set incorporates extemporised standup into a flow that veers brilliantly from comedy to poetry. With Skinner working the crowd superbly, Dry Your Eyes feels cathartic, then everyone bounces around like loons to a triumphantly silly Fit But You Know It. Any suspicions that this brutally fashionable crowd might not warm to main stage headliner George Ezra\u2019s lightweight, family friendly hits prove unfounded, as Paradise, Shotgun and the rest get teenagers in mud-covered glittery outfits dancing. Many, though, opt to see the weekend out at the vast Valley stage, where Diplo\u2019s Major Lazer mix dancehall and a Drake remix into a crowdpleasing, audiovisual spectacular. Parklife isn\u2019t for everybody, but for a festival that\u2019s more like a massive rave, it is the place to go."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
