Why would anyone want to work there?", "bodyText": "\"Antarctica, the coldest, most exhilarating and isolated continent in the world, offers exceptional challenges. We rely on motivated steel/mast erectors and fabricators to maintain buildings and facilities that support vital scientific investigations in the most hostile of environments. Shifts usually last for 12 hours for six and sometimes seven days a week. No two days are the same. Life here is like nowhere else so you must be ready to enjoy all the challenges it offers. Salary will be between \u00a315,171 and \u00a317,700pa pro-rata with an Antarctic allowance of \u00a31,903 pro-rata\" Most Britons have revelled in the summer heatwave, relaxing as the temperatures soar and the sun beats down on city pavements. But according to the advert just placed by British Antarctic Survey, dozens of construction workers are dreaming of life on a polar ice shelf. To the amazement of sun worshippers, they can imagine nothing better than toiling for 12-hour shifts, seven days a week in freezing temperatures, thousands of miles from civilisation. The BAS has launched a recruitment drive for steel erectors to maintain its southern-most research centre during the continent's four-month summer. And it is proving very popular, the organisation says, despite the numerous drawbacks of polar life. Antarctica is the coldest and windiest continent, and the Halley base - latitude 75 35' S, longitude 26 30' W - is the remotest of the five British stations there. Each year 15 staff see out the long winter, when temperatures fall as low as -55C and darkness reigns for 105 days, relieved only by the spectacular auroral displays. Even in summer, when numbers on the base swell to 65, temperatures can plummet to -28C. Many staff develop chronic polar insomnia because of the 24-hour daylight. All long for fresh fruit and vegetables, since food supplies arrive just twice a year and must be dragged 12km from the coast. One former staff member recalls his colleagues fantasising endlessly about the tang of tomatoes. And applicants need to be sure that they can get on with the rest of the team: the nearest neighbours are 30km away and rather short of conversation, being Emperor penguins. The Halley site, on the Brunt Ice Shelf, has been occupied by the British since 1956, but the first four bases had to be abandoned because they were crushed by ice. The steel erectors will have to save the current set of buildings by jacking up the steel legs supporting the building platforms, to keep them clear of the accumulated snowfall. They will also put up new masts and other structures to assist with research. The centre is best known for its work in monitoring the hole in the ozone layer, but it also studies atmospheric pollution, sea level rise, climate change and geology. But while scientists have often devoted their lives to examining particular phenomena, support staff on the bases have other motives. Many find that a four-month contract is an ideal way to save money: pay begins at \u00a315,000 a year, all accommodation, food and clothing come free, and there is nowhere to spend money. Others who have worked there enthuse about the astonishing wildlife and the opportunities for skiing and snowboarding. But most are seeking the adventure of a lifetime, the BAS says. \"For many people it's a life-changing experience,\" said Linda Capper, spokeswoman for the organisation, who herself spent three months at Halley. \"I was completely awed by the landscape. I had seen so many photographs and read so much about it, but nothing could prepare me for that wave of emotion that hit me when I saw the continent. It's incredible. \"You feel as if you are a tiny dot, less than even a dot, on the huge landscape. As far as the eye can see, it is flat and white. Towards the coast there are fantastic ice cliffs hundreds of feet high.\" Then there is the camaraderie that develops within the closely knit teams. \"Suddenly you are there on your own with only colleagues to rely on, and you have to be able to rely on them, because once the ship leaves you have to get on with it,\" she explained. \"You see your colleagues in a very different way because they become your community. Your friendships become much stronger. It's very intense - you certainly feel very sad to leave. It's an enormous privilege to be part of it.\" Contractors will fly out to the Falklands in October and then face an arduous four-week sea journey across dangerous passages, arriving at the base in November, at the start of the Antarctic summer. Once they arrive at Halley they are stuck there for four months, with no opportunity to change their mind as the magnitude of their task sinks in. None of the training they have had in England or on board the ship can prepare them for the extremes of the environment. \"It's a dangerous place. You certainly can't go walking off on your own,\" Mrs Capper said. The field training is also arduous, involving ice cliff climbs and abseiling into crevasses. Then there are the \"blows\", when polar winds whip up the snow from the ground, until it is impossible to distinguish between land and sky. But the greatest danger of all for those who work there is simply falling in love with the continent. Many find themselves unwilling to leave. \"The stark polar lands grip the hearts of the men who have lived on them in a manner that can hardly be understood by the people who have never got outside the pale of civilisation,\" Ernest Shackleton wrote when he first returned from Antarctica. Almost a century on, it seems that the call of the wild remains as powerful as ever. What a way to earn a living Deep Sea Divers Numerous North Sea diving deaths in the 1970s and 1980s prompted a safety drive that slashed mortality rates. But divers still face perils as they work, sometimes in total darkness, hundreds of feet down in the oceans. Hazards of the job include the bends and jellyfish stings. Goldminers The depths at which miners work - often more than two miles below the surface - mean that the effects of even minor earth tremors can be devastating, causing tunnels to collapse. In South Africa, where tremors are frequent, four men died and 11 others were trapped for days when hundreds of tons of rocks collapsed at the Orkney shaft, 100 miles south-west of Johannesburg, last year Steeplejacks Risk of accidental death is believed to be around one in 1,000 each year.
