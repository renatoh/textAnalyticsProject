For years after its release Oasis' Be Here Now was held up as a sort of musical Millennium Dome, a vainglorious nadir for 90s rock, prima facie evidence of the terrible havoc that cocaine can wreak not merely on a great band, but an entire era. More recently, however, it has been difficult not to gaze upon Be Here Now with a wistful eye. Mainstream rock music learned its lesson rather too well from Oasis' 1997 debacle. Ever since, it has reined in its excesses, kept on the rails, done its level best not to offend our sensibilities. The result has been an overwhelming glut of nice singer-songwriters, stadium rockers peddling vanilla angst, indie bands so eager to please you worry they may have missed their true calling as Butlins Redcoats. The gaudy splat of the Scissor Sisters and Muse notwithstanding, the biggest sellers on the top 20 album chart are just different shades of drab. With things as they are, is it any wonder the hulking, coke-blasted caution-to-the-wind excess and wrongness of Oasis' grand folly has started to take on a perversely appealing hue? You can detect a creeping desire for music as unrestricted by the confines of tastefulness in the eagerness with which the media has pounced on the Horrors' goth revival and the critical garlanding of Primal Scream's unabashedly idiotic album Riot City Blues. It may also help explain Jet's global triumph. The premise of the Melbourne quartet looks unpromising: does the world really need a Walkabout pub version of Oasis? Apparently so. Their 2003 debut album Get Born sold 4m copies. Their brazenness caused consternation back home (where they were dubbed, with admirable Aussie forthrightness, the Shitty Beatles) but Jet's brazenness might be the point. In a world where Oasis themselves seem straitened and cowed by Be Here Now's artistic bellyflop, here was a band who couldn't seem to care less. If anything, they seemed more shamelessly reactionary, spiking the Gallaghers' blueprint with cock-rock riffs, cheery sexism, and a song lambasting the cult of the superstar DJ. Get Born's follow-up suggests their musical palette is substantially broader than that of their progenitors or than their Cro-Magnon image suggests. You can't really picture Oasis coming up with anything like the bracing hybrid of heavy metal and Krautrock that opens That's All Lies, nor Shiny Magazines' oddly effective cocktail of Be My Baby drama and West Coast harmony pop. The ballad Eleanor further suggests out-of-the-box thinking, albeit by the simple expedient of sounding like the Hollies - a 60s influence admittedly, but hardly one plundered to death in recent years. Nevertheless, a familiar Lennon-by-way-of-Slade template predominates. It would be futile to deny that Oasis loom large over proceedings, given that vocalist Nic Cester occasionally even affects Mancunian vowels: \"Cooom on, cooom on,\" he bellows on the prosaically titled Come On, Come On. What's noticeably absent is the thin-lipped portentousness that quickly replaced Noel Gallagher's early wit. Instead, there's gonzo-rock swagger. The thunderous Rip It Up and Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is hardly amount to rocket science, but it would take a concerted effort to suppress a smile while listening to them. There are drawbacks. Aside from the title track, a touching tribute to Cester's late father, the lyrics are agonisingly stupid throughout. Jet are big on symbolism that doesn't quite work. \"Paperweight, baby, that's my name,\" howls Holiday, \"I can't relate 'cause you're all the same.\" You get the gist, but it's hard not to wonder if anti-establishment sentiment is really best expressed through the metaphor of decorative office furniture. \"Climb to the top of the mountain, but you're still alone,\" sneers That's All Lies, which rather implies Jet think that mountaintops are the ideal place to make friends, thronged as they usually are with people, nightclubs, dating agencies etc. They are big, too, on handing out advice that you either can't quite follow (\"walk on with your feet off the ground,\" they suggest) or else seems wildly contradictory. There's nothing wrong with a band flaunting its anti-authoritarian stance with the line \"if they ask you to stand, they just want you to kneel\". But it takes a special kind of logic to immediately follow that advice first with a track loudly insisting the listener stand up (called Stand Up), then with a song featuring a chorus demanding you \"get on your feet\". \"You're not too bright,\" concludes the latter, taking the words out of your mouth. Then again, nobody is going to buy Shine On expecting intellectual enlightenment. It's trad-rock ordinaire, yet something lifts it out of the ordinary: its cheek, maybe, or its freewheeling vitality, or the occasional musical surprise it springs. Perhaps most appealingly, given the current inhibitions of mainstream rock, Shine On doesn't appear to give a monkey's."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
