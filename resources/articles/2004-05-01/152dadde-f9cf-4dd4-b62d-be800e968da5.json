There is talent, huge desire, bags of pace and power, and tactically they would complement each other. Everyone in the team is comfortable with the ball and I would definitely look for a passing game. I would not want them doing anything but passing and moving. But when the space opens up to play a telling ball, they would be expected to do that because with the midfielders and strikers I can see nothing but goals. I think I have got the best four midfielders in the country and a nice balance, not just between defence and attack but the way the team can make things happen. On the right Steven Gerrard can send over early crosses and on the left I would expect a more studious passing game involving Robert Pires, Thierry Henry and sometimes Wayne Bridge from full-back. Gerrard's vital with Alan Shearer in the side. He has got the ability to whip in crosses with power, pace and bend which Shearer would be on the end of. When the ball gets to Gerrard 30 yards out you can rely on him delivering quickly. Everyone knows how great the combination of Henry and Pires is on the left. They would be allowed to do what they do for Arsenal. There would be no restrictions on them and they would not have to worry too much defensively because there are three others in midfield who can do that and four great defenders. Their job would be to express themselves when they get possession. They are always looking for a way round, searching for cracks in the opposition. But they will also know that Bridge can get forward on the overlap and I would expect Frank Lampard to make runs from deep to get into scoring positions. It would be Lampard's job to get involved from midfield in the initial play and then be that third man running, getting upfield to look for goals. He can get on the end of crosses but has enough to know when he needs to get back and defend. The bigger defensive job in central midfield will fall to Patrick Vieira. He will dictate the pace of the game. I would not want him to go up too much but mainly break up the opposition's play and use the ball to set up attacks. In terms of attacking, I have gone for full-backs in Lauren and Bridge who are not just good defenders but happy on the ball. In the modern game you need full-backs who can contribute going forward and get you a goal every now and again. Bridge, in particular, can be a threat with his crossing and will have Shearer and Lampard to aim for. Defensively it helps that Lauren plays for his club with one of the centre-backs, Sol Campbell, and Bridge plays with the other, John Terry. I like those central defenders because they are totally uncompromising. I am of the old school that wants centre-backs who can defend first and foremost. Anything else is a bonus. These two will defend for their lives. If an opponent needs kicking or intimidating they will do that and they are good communicators. So is the goalkeeper Antti Niemi. He can make saves when necessary, come and collect things and clean up problems. Antti Niemi (Southampton) - Goalkeeper The Finn has not only been consistent this term but was arguably in the top two or three last season as well. That is why he gets the nod when there are four or five goalkeepers I could have picked, from Tim Howard to Thomas Sorensen. He commands his six-yard box and makes big saves when he needs to, and it is hardly surprising that one or two big clubs have been linked with him. His biggest strength is probably his ability as a shot-stopper. Agility is something goalkeepers in the modern game need and he has the perfect build for that. He gets to shots and headers that you think he is not going to reach. Lauren (Arsenal) - Right-back There are not a great deal of challengers. Mario Melchiot and Glen Johnson have done OK at Chelsea but neither has cemented the position. Gary Neville has had a shaky season by his standards and Stephen Carr has not had his best year, so I make Lauren the comfortable winner. He has been consistent high quality and has grown into what is not his natural position. He defends well and his recovery is good, meaning he can get up and get back at people if he goes to ground. He is also strong, uncompromising and gets forward. I have seen better right-backs in the last third but Arsenal do not build a lot of attacks down that side so he is just about right for them. Sol Campbell (Arsenal) - Centre-back He has been a giant. Arsenal were looking for someone to step in and take over from a legend in Tony Adams and he has done that. A lot of people would be fazed by filling those shoes but Campbell has been a perfect replacement. He has a lot of the things that Adams had: experience and hunger for success. He hates losing and is an unbelievable competitor. He suffered real disappointment at the end of last season, when he was sent off against Manchester United, saw Arsenal overtaken and missed the FA Cup final - you can see how desperate he has been to win the league. He has been fantastic and is improving with experience. His decision-making is much better than at Tottenham when he was younger. John Terry (Chelsea) - Centre-back Chelsea spent millions bringing in a host of foreign talent but three English boys - Terry, Frank Lampard and Wayne Bridge - have been their best players. Terry gets better and better. The responsibility of being captain seems to have helped him and he is growing into that. He makes the odd error or wrong decision but you have to accept that from a young centre-back and you can see he learns from his mistakes. Kolo Tour\u00e9 would be very close because he has had a fantastic season for Arsenal, and Olof Mellberg at Aston Villa is an excellent centre-back. He has been great, as has Matthew Upson at Birmingham. Wayne Bridge (Chelsea) - Left-back Ashley Cole has not done a lot wrong but for me it's a toss-up between Bridge and Aston Villa's Jlloyd Samuel, with Bridge edging it. He has played most of Chelsea's league games and has consistently performed to a high level. His defensive qualities have improved and going forward he is growing in confidence. Samuel has unbelievable talent and might make a stunning left-back or even left-midfielder; he just lacks a bit of experience. He is great coming forward and talented on the ball but has to improve defensively, which will come. Steven Gerrard (Liverpool) - Right midfield I know he plays central for Liverpool but I want him in the team and there have been no outstanding right-sided players anyway. Freddie Ljungberg has not been great, Chelsea have not settled on anyone there and it has been the same for Manchester United and Newcastle. It has been a problem area for a lot of top clubs. Gerrard has been the shining light when Liverpool have looked less than convincing. He has driven them on and getting the captaincy has been wonderful for him. He has stopped collecting silly bookings and has played every game. He plays with his heart on his sleeve but with his head as well and the quality of his football has been unbelievable. Frank Lampard (Chelsea) - Central midfield He has been outstanding and puts to bed the idea that a player cannot play every game without being tired. I do not like rotation and he has restored my faith in the old-fashioned way of thinking: that you play your best team every time. Ten league goals is a sign that he has performed and he has improved his quality of passing hugely. At West Ham he did not do anything too fancy and caught the eye mainly because he was a good runner without the ball and got ahead of play to score. Now his all-round game is far better. He must have pushed Thierry Henry very hard for player of the season. Patrick Vieira (Arsenal) - Central midfield Graeme Souness said to me recently: \"If you see Patrick Vieira, tell him quite simply he's the top man.\" If Graeme thinks Vieira's the best, I am not going to argue because Graeme was one of the finest midfielders I have seen or played with and he knows what you need to play that position. Vieira is a leader, the driving force behind Arsenal and hugely talented. If you were to design a model of the perfect midfield player for the 21st century, he is it: 6ft 3in, powerful, athletic and gifted. But even he has got room for improvement. He really should score more goals than the two he has got this season. Robert Pires (Arsenal) - Left midfield If you are looking for a wide player to create and score, Pires is the best in the business. He has got 19 goals this season, which is an outstanding total, and must have set up another 20. That means he has been responsible for almost 40 Arsenal goals and you cannot ask for more than that. The Premiership has also toughened him up. Pires is never going to be a Roy Keane, Vieira or Gerrard, who rattles into tackles, but he can cope with the physical demands of people playing against him. I cannot see beyond him because Damien Duff's not played enough and Ryan Giggs has had no more than a decent season. Thierry Henry (Arsenal) - Striker He has had a phenomenal season, his best ever, and must have changed the way people think of a centre-forward. He has certainly changed my way of thinking because he plays the position in a way I have never seen before and in a way not many people could manage. He does not stand up against the centre-halves or even play from the centre of the pitch. If I was to close my eyes while watching Arsenal and then guess where Henry was standing, I would probably say left of centre or left wing. Nine times out of 10 I would be right. He does not track back that much but wanders back into areas of the pitch where he does not get marked and then, when he gets the ball, he comes to life. He has got blinding pace and uses it so well. A lot of players have pace but not many can control the ball at speed the way he does. You see quick players get ahead of themselves or fall over the ball but you never see Henry do that. He has mastered the art of controlling the ball and running with it. What has improved over the years is his finishing. He was hit and miss but now he is more hit than miss and he deserves 30 league goals this season. Alan Shearer (Newcastle United) - Striker A few strikers have a decent case for playing alongside Henry. Ruud van Nistelrooy had a great two-thirds of the season, Juan Pablo Angel has done well and Mikael Forssell has done unbelievably at Birmingham City, scoring 17 goals in a team who do not create a lot of chances. Michael Owen has got his goals without being consistent by his standards. But I have gone for a centre-forward who played the game much like I did. Shearer's coming to the end of his career but has still got enough to score 20-plus goals in a season. At a time when he might be fading a bit, he has shown the hunger and drive to keep pushing his body and never wants to be rested. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger (Arsenal) - Manager You always have to go with the manager who wins the title because he has proved his team's the best, but two others are right up there with him. One is Harry Redknapp, who kept Portsmouth up with something to spare. The fact that Harry considers what he has done this season as his best achievement in football shows what a year he has had. The other is David O'Leary, who took over an Aston Villa team that just missed relegation and has taken them to the brink of the Champions League."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
