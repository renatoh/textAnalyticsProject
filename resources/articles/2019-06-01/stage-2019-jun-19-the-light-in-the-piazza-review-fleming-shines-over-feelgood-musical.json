And if her character \u2013 Margaret Johnson, a 1950s American tourist in Florence losing her daughter Clara to a whirlwind romance \u2013 is going to blame her confusion on anything it might as well be that. Italy is in every moment of Adam Guettel\u2019s musical \u2013 or at least an idealised Italy, as comfortingly picturesque as the London of a Richard Curtis film. First staged in 2003, with a book by Craig Lucas, The Light in the Piazza scooped half a dozen Tony awards for its Broadway production in 2005. Elizabeth Spencer\u2019s original story, inspired by her own travels, was published in 1960, the year of La Dolce Vita, though it has more in common with 1953\u2019s Roman Holiday. Daniel Evans\u2019s production, with sets by Robert Jones and gorgeous Dior-style costumes by Brigitte Reiffenstuel, is stylish even while it brings out all the cliches. Three minutes in you think \u201call this needs is a Vespa\u201d \u2013 and, presto pronto, on it rolls. At heart it\u2019s a feelgood musical about the supremacy of True Love. Yet there are other elements, the most important being the fact that Clara\u2019s radiant innocence is the result of childhood brain damage. Should she be treated as an independent woman? Before we can get too tied up in that question, we\u2019re always back to True Love \u2013 and Margaret\u2019s experience of it, or not. This heavyweight role is a good vehicle for Fleming\u2019s star quality now that she has stepped back from the opera stage. The melodies lie a little low for her, but higher up her voice soars, and she offers a masterclass in how to shape a phrase. Guettel\u2019s ambitious score is barely less demanding on the rest of the cast. As a composer he has the blessing and the burden of being the grandson of Richard Rodgers; he inherited his piano, meaning that some of this was composed at the same instrument as Edelweiss and You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone. The music rarely settles for long enough to be similarly hummable, but that\u2019s not the point: instead, it swirls through bittersweet harmonies as though playing hide-and-seek with the keynote, harp and woodwind to the fore. Conducted by Kimberly Grigsby, it\u2019s lushly played by the Orchestra of Opera North, even if the sound design makes them seem to be playing from an empty hall next door. Dove Cameron is a convincingly angelic Clara, Rob Houchen a winning Fabrizio, and Alex Jennings enjoys himself playing his silver-fox father. Marie McLaughlin \u2013 another opera veteran \u2013 is classy as Signora Naccarelli, and Celinde Schoenmaker stands out as fiery Franca. None is Italian, but some of their words are, both sung and spoken. McLaughlin steps out of character to translate one of the ensembles for us, but when Houchen delivers Fabrizio\u2019s big infatuation number we\u2019re supposed to wallow in the language of love. As for the dialogues, it feels odd today to be hearing non-Italian actors speaking in broken English, and to be expected to find it amusingly charming. This feels of a piece with the aura of lazy, hazy nostalgia that clings to the whole musical. There\u2019s a lot of light in this piazza, but not a corresponding amount of shade. \u2022 The Light in the Piazza is at the Royal Festival Hall, London, until 5 July."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
