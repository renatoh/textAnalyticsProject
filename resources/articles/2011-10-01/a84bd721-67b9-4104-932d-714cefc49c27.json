This image from the Krautrockers' current 3D installation in Munich goes back to their 1978 album The Man-Machine, with the foursome identically dressed and poised like single-minded robots, suspended against a red infinity backdrop. The flat, featureless and suitably inhuman vacuum for their electronic sounds is classically postmodern and a creepy precursor of cinema's depthless green screen illusionism. Rustie: Glass Swords The artwork for dubstep star Rustie's album, Glass Swords, claims allegiance with past icons of mind-expanding music and bygone dance scenes that favoured futuristic hedonism over techno despots. Australian artist Jonathan Zawada's twin glass shards glittering in the unflinching light of a new dawn, are modernist monoliths by way of the psychedelic 70s and new age 90s. Perhaps their nearest relative is the prism that graced Pink Floyd's prog rock classic, Dark Side Of The Moon. Halo: The Art Of Building Words Presumably Halo wouldn't be much of a bad-ass computer game if it was all blissed-out utopia. As Halo: The Art Of Building Words, (Titan Books, \u00a324.99) exploring the world-building behind the action confirms, it's the exact opposite: a cyber age dystopian nightmare with Old Testament overtones. Though the viewpoint is presumably the prow of a spaceship, this vista of a landscape engulfed by laser beams and brimstone is pure John Martin, the hit painter who wowed the Victorians with grandiose visions of biblical apocalypse. As with Martin's vast canvasses, Halo's blood-dimmed skies and glowering black mountains frame destruction on an epic scale. Grant Morrison's Superman In a response to present-day earthly troubles, the most iconic comicbook hero of them all has been given a contemporary makeover, thanks to cult writer Grant Morrison's Action Comics reboot. Gone is Superman's blue cat-suit, the unlikely underpants as outerwear; in their place is the simple garb of real men the world over: jeans and a T-shirt. He's like Bruce Springsteen's American blue-collar hero crossed with the muscle-bound workers celebrated in Soviet socialist realism. Michael Clark While Kraftwerk gave us identikit machine men, since the 1980s Michael Clark has crowded po-mo's slippery surfaces with a dazzling pick-n-mix of punk, pop and ballet where androgynous personas sport outlandish costumes. This publicity photo for the original 1992 production of Mmm, included in a swanky new book on Clark from Violette Editions, shows the dancer and choreographer nude but for arm-length bear gloves. He's performing a superhuman move to become a white abstract squiggle, in a perfectly daffy muddying of the sublime with the ridiculous."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
