It was the mantra of 11 million long-suffering Cubans but it could have been more besides: a strapline for the island's tourism; the salsa lyrics gusting from a bar; the war-cry of revolutionary socialism - or perhaps its epitaph. At the centre of these contradictions is Havana. I'd like to be able to say that in the island's capital, all the disparate threads of Cuban life come together, but it isn't so. Unlike the lavish, brilliantly coloured provinces, the air in Havana was antique and the light filmy and sweet. Time stopped on the day the revolutionaries entered the city, in 1959, and caught in its crusted snapshot were the Oldsmobiles and Studebakers, the decay, the El Greco faces, the horsemen and the sense of normality suspended. In the earlier conflict during the 1890s, the war hacks had stayed at The Inglaterra, and so did we. Little had changed; the terrace of boot-shines and violin quartets, the arabesque tiles and the art deco nudity. The food was now probably worse - just cheese sandwiches, imperceptibly varied according to the mealtime. Sometimes we wandered down to The Seville for a change of cheese. Former guests were remembered here in portraits; Joe Louis, Al Capone, Gloria Swanson, Isadora Duncan, Piaf, Brando. Graham Greene had arrived at the moment time stopped. The revolutionaries smashed up the casino and it remains closed to this day. I was thrilled by Havana with its coral palaces and flaky grandeur. It was a city of powerful drinks and cartoon whores, of snake-charmers and dancing dwarves. Small wonder that Ernest Hemingway was briefly happy here. He fled in fear of revolutionary asceticism, but he needn't have worried. Habaneros are still shameless, dancing coitally and swinging their buttocks in Lycra. Hemingway's house is preserved, every tumbler in its place. When it was time to tear ourselves away, we joined our group. There were 16 of us, united in the conviction that, as Fidel Castro was now over 76, something was about to happen. Other than that, our curiosity took different forms. Only the oldest lady brought any revolutionary loyalty. Others brought VCRs or Hemingway, and one woman brought condoms. And then we were off through Cuba: local transport, local houses. Olivia was our guide. We were all a bit in love with Olivia, if only because we were soon her dependants. Although young and English, she could deal with officials without tearing her hair out. When Cuban Railways couldn't get the engine back in their train, she found us buses. When our mountain taverna fluffed our bookings, she found us tents. She knew of beaches without sharks and restaurants with food. After the train disembowelment, we took to the island in a small bus. First, we wandered across the sugar lands. We passed towns famous for witchcraft, opera or vile cigarettes. At the village of Remedios, the locals organised a barrage of fireworks. Their band marched on, round the plaza phrumphing and tootling with singed hair and oil-cans of rum. There was more dancing at Santa Clara. The jazz was sublime - raw, unplugged, passionate but seldom expressing happiness. Life's not easy, I remembered. And nor was it. Cuban life taps along to a rhythm of scarcity and rationing. Bread is down to 80 grammes per person per day. There's no make-up, no Biros, no butter - and hardly any fuel. Polythene bags hang out to dry. A rickshaw economy flourishes. Everyone's a hitchhiker, flaunting wads of useless pesos, a cabbage or just a good pair of thighs. We had the autopista to ourselves - great valiant sweeps of feeder-lanes and junctions - all clipped, tarred and empty. \"Built in the Age of the Fat Cow,\" people told us, \"when the Russians were here.\" It was different for us. At around $40 a day, we could get almost what we wanted: dinner or a taxi across town, for $10; museums, $3; beer, $2. Some 40% of Cuban imports go towards servicing tourism. For Cuban socialism, milking tourism has become the price of survival. But as money empowers, so it divides. A state of financial apartheid leaves Cubans with fewer rights than visitors. Some (such as doctors, on $50 a month) can count themselves outside the system. All are banned from the resorts. \"When we grow up,\" Cubans joked. \"We want to be tourists.\" Were we really meant to enjoy this? Of course we were. The countryside was lush and extravagant, a carnival of succulents, waterfalls, humming-birds and ox-teams. The cities on the other hand were grandiose - Camaguey, Bayamo and Santiago. Their citizens, though never ebullient were forgiving, phlegmatic and resourceful. They rode three to a bike and roasted pigs on Revolution Square. There were miniaturised goat-carts for the children, and the veterans wore battledress. Peddlars called themselves \"mobile sales points\" and sold lantern fuel and sandpaper. At the frontline of this vaguely commercial activity were our lodgings, the casas particulares. Initially, Castro had tormented such enterprises with lacerating taxes, but now an uneasy ceasefire prevailed. For around $25 a night, our landlords provided a service that was surprisingly uniform the length of the island: delicious coffee; a room over-awed by its bed; a courtyard of rocking-chairs; a dachshund and an enormous, pre-revolution fridge. Sometimes, there was even a flowering of individuality, a portrait of a dog or a wall of turtle-heads. As much as our hosts were the forerunners of a new era, so were they refugees from Cuba's past. Some bore names cast in the cold war: Boris, Tatiana or Ivan. Others were veterans of warmer adventures: Paulo fought in Angola; his brother in Syria. Some were farmers and spread bundles of cigars before us. Others were graduates, physicists making ice-cream, or doctors dressing Christmas trees. They had few possessions and copied our tapes and begged our books. At night, they often waited up for us, sprawled on the doorstep with their dogs and parrots and Mozart. Everyone offered dinner - delicious black-market chicken and coconut puddings - but they never ate with us; it was \"dollar food\". Elsewhere, idealism was bellowing itself hoarse. \"Discipline Is Triumph!\" proclaimed the walls \"Resist And Conquer!\" We followed Che Guevara's campaign trail. His bullet-holes were revered. Every city had its Revolutionary Museum of bloodied shirts and guns. One day, we clambered up to the revolutionaries' shangri-la, their old hideout in the Sierra Maestra. Up there, in the cloud and jungle, there were orange trees and parrots and glorious ferns. Fidel's hut, we noticed, had a van-sized fridge and a sumptuous double-bed. Later, his musicians - the Quinteto Rebelde - played at our camp. Though they'd been singing for 45 years, through gunfire and scarcity, their voices quivered with nostalgia. They played all night, long after we'd gone to our tents. \"De tu querida presencia, Commandante Che Guevara...\" Towards the end, an ancient Russian truck carried us down to the toe of Cuba, together with 12 labourers, two lady-soldiers and a cargo of potatoes. We passed Guantanamo and on to a fishing town cut off from the world until the 1960s. In 1512, Columbus recorded that the beauty of this horseshoe bay had left him momentarily speechless. The locals have been filling the silence ever since. Unlike other Cubans, they saw life as an endless feast. Scarcity hardly worried them. They fished and made chocolate. They grew vegetables in tyres, helmets, anything. Their strength was derived from the greatest Cuban rebel of them all, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed (1853-95). \"If you're destined to be a sardine,\" he'd said, \"the can will drop from heaven.\" \u00b7 John Gimlette's first book, At The Tomb Of The Inflatable Pig is published by Hutchinson at \u00a314.99 on January 16.
