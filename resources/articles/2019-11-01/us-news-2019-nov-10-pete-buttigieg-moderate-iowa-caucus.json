The cafetorium at the local high school was filled with more than 500 people wanting to hear Buttigieg make his pitch to be their next president. But those who had closely followed his recent three-day bus tour through the first caucus state were unsurprised by such a turnout; the 37-year-old mayor commanded large crowds at each of his campaign stops, reflecting his rise up the Iowa polls. One recent poll even showed Buttigieg climbing into second place, one point behind Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s 20% and beating out Senator Bernie Sanders and the former vice-president Joe Biden. Given its role as the first state to vote in the presidential primaries, Iowa is key to most Democratic candidates\u2019 strategies. Since 2000, every Democrat who has won the Iowa caucuses has gone on to win the presidential nomination of their party. With less than three months to go until Iowa voters hold their caucuses, the looming question over Buttigieg\u2019s surprise campaign is whether he will maintain the momentum he has seen in recent weeks or fizzle out as other Democratic candidates have. Some of his opponents\u2019 allies have dismissed the validity of Buttigieg\u2019s surge, calling the young mayor \u201cthe flavor of the moment\u201d. But Buttigieg\u2019s campaign insists his current momentum in Iowa is legitimate, powered by more than 100 staffers spread across more than 20 field offices. \u201cWe\u2019ve built an organization in Iowa that is capable of capturing this momentum and converting it to committed caucus-goers to knock on doors, host house meetings, and win the Iowa caucuses for Pete,\u201d said Ben Halle, Buttigieg\u2019s Iowa communications director. Speaking in Waverly exactly one year before the 2020 general election, Buttigieg zeroed in on a message of unifying the country after Trump leaves office. The mayor opened his remarks by asking attendees to \u201creally visualize the first day when the sun comes up over the United States of America, and Donald Trump is no longer in the White House\u201d. After the sustained applause that followed this suggestion, Buttigieg emphasized that the next president would have to find solutions capable of bringing Americans together. \u201cWhat the next president\u2019s going to have to do, what I am running to do, is to pick up the pieces and guide this nation in a direction where we can solve those big problems with big answers and do it in a way that unifies, not polarizes, the American people,\u201d Buttigieg told the Waverly crowd. This unifying message appears to be resonating with voters in the purple state of Iowa, where Republicans control the governor\u2019s mansion and the state legislature but Democrats hold three of the state\u2019s four congressional seats. Buttigieg has made a point of visiting Iowa counties that flipped from Barack Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016, underscoring his strategy of reaching voters who have not consistently voted for Democrats in recent years. Standing near a table selling \u201cBoot-Edge-Edge\u201d shirts, referring to the phonetic pronunciation of the mayor\u2019s name, Josie Beckstrom, 44, said after the rally that she would probably caucus for Buttigieg because she worried other Democratic candidates, such as Elizabeth Warren, would intensify political polarization in the country. \u201cI think [Warren] has burned some bridges, and I think that division will just get worse in a lot of ways,\u201d Beckstrom said. \u201cI think it just needs to be over.\u201d Warren has implicitly pushed back against Buttigieg\u2019s big-tent message by criticizing his \u201cvague\u201d proposals that she argues would do little to address the nation\u2019s problems. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do this by kind of nibbling around the edges,\u201d Warren said at Democratic representative Abby Finkenauer\u2019s recent fish fry in Cedar Rapids, speaking just before Buttigieg. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do it by running some kind of vague campaign with a bunch of slogans that have been approved by a bunch of consultants not to offend anyone.\u201d Some Iowa voters voiced similar concerns after Buttigieg\u2019s Waverly rally, reflecting a split between the party\u2019s centrist and progressive wings. Tim Elgin, 36, said he preferred Buttigieg\u2019s campaign messaging from earlier this year, when the mayor was pushing back more forcefully against Republican attacks. With half an eye on his two young children, Elgin said after the Waverly event, \u201cI\u2019m intrigued a little bit to see how he\u2019s going to deal with some of his initial statements. \u2026 I want to see how consistent he is.\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s apparent recalculation away from progressive policies like Medicare for All has led some to question the sincerity of his campaign promises. One rally attendee described the mayor as \u201ckind of smarmy\u201d and suggested he tone down his \u201csalesman\u201d persona. But many attendees were impressed with Buttigieg\u2019s performance on the stump and his evident gifts as a politician. \u201cHe seems like somebody you\u2019d know down the block, which is very rewarding and comforting,\u201d said Kate Payne, 61. Mike Reitmajer, 37, said his ability to connect more with Buttigieg was one of the main reasons he had drifted to the mayor from the Biden camp. \u201cHe\u2019s younger, which makes him a little more relatable,\u201d Reitmajer said. Despite some critics\u2019 skepticism of Buttigieg\u2019s relatively thin r\u00e9sum\u00e9 compared with those of his opponents, several likely caucus-goers pointed to his mayoral experience in Indiana as an asset. But even as rally attendees praised Buttigieg\u2019s background as a midwestern mayor and military veteran, none of the six likely caucus-goers who spoke to the Guardian mentioned another key aspect of the candidate\u2019s biography: if elected, he would be the first openly gay man to serve as president. Buttigieg himself touched on this when taking audience members\u2019 questions in Waverly, describing his decision to come out while running for re-election as mayor of South Bend. Buttigieg won that race, and the now married mayor told the Waverly crowd: \u201cThis thing that I thought might mean the end of my career wound up being one of the things that gave me the chance to do the most good.\u201d But the issue does arise. The House majority whip, Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, recently said \u201cthere\u2019s no question\u201d the mayor\u2019s sexuality was an issue for older African American voters. Outside the mostly white state of Iowa, Buttigieg has generally struggled to attract the support of African American voters, who make up a large swath of the Democratic primary electorate. A Monmouth University poll released late last month showed the Indiana mayor receiving the support of just 1% of black voters in South Carolina, another early voting state. But Buttigieg has voiced confidence that the momentum he has seen in Iowa will soon translate to more racially diverse states. Addressing Clyburn\u2019s comments in a CNN interview, Buttigieg again referenced his re-election in South Bend as evidence that he could win over \u201csocially conservative Democrats\u201d. \u201cAnd at the end of the day I think the reason why the people in my community moved past that and re-elected me, and the reason why we\u2019re going to be able to earn votes in every part of the country, is because elections are about this \u2013 they\u2019re about voters asking a question: \u2018How will my life be different if you get elected versus somebody else?\u2019\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cI think we have the best answer to that question.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
