Though some composers continued to write operas in which the symbiotic relationship between the music, the words and the drama they conveyed was much the same as it had been for the previous 300 years, others took the opportunity to reconsider basic assumptions about dramatic structure, and the role of music within it. In the years after the second world war a whole generation of young avant garde composers viewed opera with suspicion. It was an outmoded art form, they decided, too heavily indebted to the past. Composers who still found it had something to offer (Benjamin Britten and Hans Werner Henze, for example) were generally regarded with disdain. Gradually, however, attitudes softened until almost all of those former hard-liners became more or less reconciled with the form, even if they had to reimagine it in their own terms. With the collapse of tonality, music had lost much of its narrative power, they reasoned, and so storytelling need no longer be a prerequisite of opera either. The music would still contain, support and reinforce the onstage drama, but that drama didn't need to be linear: scenes could proceed simultaneously (as in Bernd Alois Zimmermann's Die Soldaten, 1965), present different versions of the same story (Harrison Birtwistle's The Mask of Orpheus), tell no story at all (Philip Glass's Einstein on the Beach) or dispense with a text altogether (Wolfgang Rihm's S\u00e9raphin, 1995). Other composers reimagined the form very differently. For them, the imperatives were less aesthetic than economic. In the 1960s and 70s opera became a very expensive art form to put on, and \"difficult\" new opera, which inevitably attracted smaller audiences, was more expensive still. Opportunities to write full-length operas complete with a chorus and full orchestra were few and far between, and so composers looked for cheaper alternatives, which were conveniently labelled as music theatre. With roots in works by composers as diverse as Monteverdi (Il Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda), Stravinsky (The Soldier's Tale) and Kurt Weill (Happy End), these stripped-down pieces often had just a single protagonist (a singer or an actor), used a chamber ensemble rather than a full orchestra and were designed to be presented in concert halls, with a minimum of set and props. Since then, however, boundaries have blurred even more, and with the use of new technologies, including the incorporation of film or real-time video and digital electronics into the work, defining what is opera and what music theatre is sometimes very hard. Today's leading composers \u2022 Hans Werner Henze (born Germany, 1926) With a career in opera stretching back 60 years, and a list of collaborators including WH Auden and Edward Bond, Henze is contemporary opera's great survivor, following his own creative path regardless of musical fashion. Key works: Boulevard Solitude (1952), Elegy for Young Lovers (1961), The English Cat (1983), The Hoopoe (2003) \u2022 Harrison Birtwistle (born UK, 1934) Everything Birtwistle composes is a kind of theatre, while his stage works, nearly all built around mythological subjects, rank among the most important of our time. Punch and Judy (1968), The Mask of Orpheus (1986), Gawain (1991), The Second Mrs Kong (1994), The Minotaur (2008) \u2022 Philip Glass (born US, 1937) With more than 20 stage works, Glass is one of the most wide-ranging opera composers. His work has shifted from the radicalism of Einstein on the Beach (1976) to the more straightforward narratives of his recent works. Satyagraha (1980), Akhnaten (1984), The Voyage (1992), La Belle et la B\u00eate (1994), Waiting for the Barbarians (2005) \u2022 Peter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s (born Hungary, 1944) E\u00f6tv\u00f6s began his composing career with impeccable avant garde credentials, but over the past decade or so his operas developed a much more accessible yet dramatically effective musical style. Three Sisters (1998), Angels in America (2004), Of Love and Other Demons (2008) \u2022 John Adams (born US, 1947) Nixon in China (1987) demonstrated that opera could deal with recent history and not just fictional subjects. Adams's subsequent stage works have continued to explore recent events in an intensely theatrical way. The Death of Klinghoffer (1991), Dr Atomic (2005) \u2022 Wolfgang Rihm (born Germany, 1952) Stage works are an important strand in Rihm's prodigious output; some of them are relatively conventional, others starkly experimental, but all match drama to music in a powerfully individual way. Jakob Lenz (1979), The Hamlet Machine (1987), The Conquest of Mexico (1992), Dionysos (2010) \u2022 Kaija Saariaho (born Finland, 1952) The shift in emphasis in Saariaho's music from texture and harmony towards a more melodic style coincided with her first opera, and that trend has continued in her subsequent stage works, all of which centre on a single female protagonist. L'Amour de Loin (2000), Adriana Mater (2006), Emilie (2010) \u2022 Judith Weir (born UK, 1954) There's remarkable theatrical sleight-of-hand in all Weir's operas, matched to music whose delicate economy conceals a remarkable dramatic power, so that music and narrative combine in teasingly unexpected ways. A Night at the Chinese Opera (1987), Blond Eckbert (1994), Miss Fortune (2011) \u2022 Detlev Glanert (born Germany, 1960) Perhaps the most widely performed German opera composer since Henze, Glanert's dozen stage works to date show his ability to write music that is both dramatically effective and arrestingly immediate. The Emperor's Mirror (1995), Joseph S\u00fcss (1999), Jest, Satire, Irony and Deeper Meaning (2000), Caligula (2006) \u2022 Mark-Anthony Turnage (born UK, 1960) Having made his name internationally with Greek, an East-End updating of the Oedipus myth, each of Turnage's subsequent operas has explored utterly different territory, both dramatically and musically. Greek (1988), The Silver Tassie (2000), Anna Nicole (2011)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
