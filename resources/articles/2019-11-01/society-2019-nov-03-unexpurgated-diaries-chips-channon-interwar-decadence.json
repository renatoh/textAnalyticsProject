Now the diaries of the Conservative politician and socialite Sir Henry \u201cChips\u201d Channon will be published in full for the first time. They include scandalous revelations that were deemed too shocking for the heavily sanitised edition published in 1967, nine years after his death. His uncensored and vivid observations about the powerful men and women he socialised with and the antics of London society during the interwar years are certain to fascinate his existing fans and will introduce a new generation of readers to his \u201celegant, gossipy and bitchy\u201d writings. In the 1960s many of the people he wrote about were still alive and could have sued for libel. \u201cThere will be people whose reputations will be damaged when this comes out,\u201d said the historian Simon Heffer, who is editing the diaries in three volumes. \u201cThere are one or two people at court, around the royal family, who Channon really takes against and who he feels are conspiring to get rid of Edward VIII. And that didn\u2019t come out in the original version.\u201d A gay relationship with \u201ca very prominent friend\u201d was also censored and will be revealed for the first time. The first volume will be published in September 2020 by Hutchinson and begins in 1918, not in 1934, like the previous redacted version. In it, Channon\u2019s extraordinary life as a wealthy young socialite in Paris emerges for the first time. \u201cHe\u2019s constantly having dinner with dukes and duchesses. They are the sort of people that Proust writes about,\u201d said Heffer. Proust himself Channon finds \u201crather an odd man, as most people did\u201d. For the first time, readers will also be able to relive Channon\u2019s life spent at cocktail parties and nightclubs with gay men and adulterous spouses in 1920s London. \u201cHe\u2019s a bright young thing in his 20s, living in the West End, and all his friends are in high society. He\u2019s out virtually every night.\u201d The diaries are candid. \u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot of drinking and drug-taking \u2013 not necessarily by him \u2013 but it\u2019s a very decadent society he moves in,\u201d said Heffer. Most of his friends don\u2019t work for a living. \u201cThey are the idle rich. And he looks at it and he\u2019s not censorious, but he describes it in great detail.\u201d The dishonesty, deviousness and occasional depravities of the upper classes are laid bare: \u201cHe will talk about people\u2019s personal lives, their sexual behaviour, their treatment of other people. All human life is there.\u201d The unexpurgated diaries also reveal how Channon\u2019s close friendship with Edward VIII began in the 1920s. \u201cHe writes about travelling around America with him. He can see the Prince of Wales is a slight flibbertigibbet, but he likes him and they have a good friendship. So by the time of the abdication, he\u2019s very supportive of him,\u201d added Heffer. Details of his 1936 trip to Germany for the Berlin Olympics and parties with G\u00f6ring, Himmler and Goebbels are published for the first time. \u201cYou see these Nazi monsters all competing with each other to give the grandest balls and there\u2019s loads of politicians from England, from all over Europe, who go there to be entertained,\u201d said Heffer. Channon finds the Nazis vulgar, \u201cnot the sort of people he\u2019d want to have to dinner\u201d \u2013 but he is impressed by certain things they have done in Germany, and fears what they will do to Britain in the second world war. \u201cHe sees the Germans as a potentially really nasty threat. He\u2019s an appeaser.\u201d As a result Channon is close to Chamberlain and sees Churchill as a \u201cwarmongering vulgarian\u201d. When the diaries were originally published two years after Churchill\u2019s death, the negative comments about the war leader were heavily censored. \u201cChannon and his circle didn\u2019t trust Churchill \u2013 he had not yet had a chance to prove he could be a great leader,\u201d said Heffer. When Churchill denounced Hitler, Channon felt he was whipping up hatred against the Germans. \u201cHe criticises Churchill for aggravating Anglo-German relations,\u201d said Heffer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
