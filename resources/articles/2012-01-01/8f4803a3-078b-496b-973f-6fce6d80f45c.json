Weir, who moved to Ibrox five years ago, has terminated his contract five months early after failing to feature at all domestically in the early part of the season. The centre-half will say his goodbyes to the Rangers support during half-time of Saturday's game at home to Aberdeen. He is aiming to find a club closer to his Cheshire home but, if no such offer is forthcoming, it is thought Weir could become a youth coach at Everton. On playing in the lower leagues in England, Weir said: \"I would have no problem with that. I am not a snob in that respect. I have played in the lower leagues and enjoyed it. I enjoy football. \"It would have been the easiest thing in the world to stay here for the rest of the season. I love it here and I enjoy coming in to work every day. But I wasn't comfortable with it as it became obvious I wasn't playing. I'm sure that wage can be utilised somewhere else. I think it is the right thing to do. It is the manager's choice if he wants to bring in someone else but I just wanted to be fair to the club.\" Ally McCoist, the Rangers manager, paid tribute to Weir. \"He deserves a big, big send-off and the thanks of everybody at the football club,\" he said. \"I've been lucky to have played with a few right good captains \u2013 and Davie would most certainly be right up there with true, great Rangers players. \"As I've said to the players, he's just epitomised what it should be to be a Rangers player, the way he's conducted himself on and off the park. I couldn't pay him a higher compliment or accolade than that. \"He's never been a minute's bother to anybody; never fallen out with anybody, and even when he's not been playing he's got his head down and done his work.\" McCoist dismissed any suggestion of West Ham United signing Nikica Jelavic for \u00a36m. Reports on Friday morning linked the Championship club with a move for the Croatian striker. \"I can certainly say that [the Rangers chairman] Craig [Whyte] feels that the amount mentioned in the newspaper of \u00a36m was well short,\" McCoist said. \"So that was his view on it. There's been no official bid at all. If it was in that region, people would be wasting their time totally \u2013 \u00a36m is not nearly enough.\" Rangers spent Friday afternoon putting the finishing touches on deals to sign the Swedish winger Mervan Celik and the Estonia defender Enar Jaager."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
