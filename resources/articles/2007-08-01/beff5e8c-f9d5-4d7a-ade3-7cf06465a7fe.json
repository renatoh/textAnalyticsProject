I have to admit to preferring non-organic to organic wine. Do you know your carbon footprint? I don't know what it is exactly, but currently it's too large. I do have a hybrid car, a couple of bikes, but not enough time to ride them, and I am trying to reduce my travel, though this is a challenge when you are chairman of a business. What was the last green thing you did? Watching European cranes dancing at dawn in Norfolk. We bought Pensthorpe nature reserve a few years ago and the family house is in the grounds. The cranes act as a natural alarm clock. If you could buy any green gadget, what would it be? We have a plan to convert the water wheel at the mill into generating electricity for the factory, which would be excellent. What wakes you up in the middle of the night? The scale of the task ahead to bring the world back into ecological working order. What skills do you have for a post-oil world? I'm not sure that any of us are particularly well equipped for this, but I guess one thing that I have fully taken on board is the need to be fairer to farmers in a world where we will need good, wholesome food, grown as close to home as possible. What would you save come the floods, apart from your family and friends? My dog and swimming trunks. \u00b7 Bill Jordan is chairman of Jordans Cereals (jordanscereals.co.uk)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
