To the delight of Downing Street, Jan Peter Balkenende criticises the \"rivers of subsidies flowing\" to farmers. Mr Balkenende, whose premiership was undermined last month when the Netherlands rejected the EU constitution, writes in today's Guardian that European leaders must reform their ways after the \"rude awakening\" of the Dutch and French no votes. \"Do we want an EU that focuses primarily on consolidation of vested interests, or one that pursues reform and displays solidarity with the less prosperous member states and the world around it?\" Mr Balkenende asks. \"European agriculture is of great importance, and we must not overlook farmers and their families. But the current system, with rivers of subsidies flowing out of Brussels, cannot last until late in the 21st century.\" Mr Balkenende's intervention was welcomed in Downing Street, which is fighting to reach agreement on the EU budget during the British presidency of the EU, which ends in December. With feelings still running high in the wake of the collapse of the European summit last month, after a public bust-up between Britain and France, Paris is refusing to give ground. Jacques Chirac used his annual Bastille Day address last week to declare that he was not prepared to make the \"least concession\" on the EU's \u00a331bn farm subsidies. Mr Blair has said he will place Britain's \u00a33.2bn budget rebate on the table if other countries, notably France, agree to reform farm subsidies, which account for around 40% of the EU budget but only 1.6% of output. Philippe Douste-Blazy, the French foreign minister, gave a taste of France's tough stance when he told a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday that reform before 2014 was \"not serious\". This irritated British officials who are hoping to broker an agreement on the next budget, which runs from 2007-13, at December's European summit. With France refusing to give ground, Britain will try to build on the support of the Netherlands, which was one of five countries that vetoed the budget at last month's summit. The others were Sweden, Finland and Spain. Mr Balkenende makes clear today that one of his strongest grievances is the \u00a32.06bn net payment his country makes to the EU each year - makingthe Netherlands' 16 million citizens the largest per capita contributors in the EU."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
