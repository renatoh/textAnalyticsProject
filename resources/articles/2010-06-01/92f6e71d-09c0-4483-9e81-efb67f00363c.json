Despite a rather dull game between the Steelbacks and the Royals (that's Northants and Worcestershire to me), enlivened only by a number of catches following one hapless fielder in rapid succession, who kept dropping them, it was a pleasant evening at a friendly ground. If it was by no stretch a capacity crowd, then there were enough for a sparky atmosphere, and generally in tune with what I am told are attendances pretty much up with expectation given the expanded schedule. Anyway, the burgers were top notch I'm told and the gourmet sausages were excellent. Only one thing blighted the evening for me. A band of enthusiastic small boys had gathered in front of us, each armed with a long plastic trumpet into which, for the duration of the match, at any opportunity, they blew raspberries. The vuvuzela had come to Wantage Road, and, if reports of the numbers being sold here are to be believed, it will not be long before the perpetual droning noise becomes a feature not just of football matches but cricket as well. Those who have seen cricket around the world know that far from being the decorous game many would have it, noise has always been an integral part of matches from the Caribbean carnival celebration and the enthusiasm of the subcontinent to the singing Barmies on tour, with trumpeter in tow. At one end of the scale comes the cut-glass chatter, politeness and rippling applause of a Lord's gathering, and at the other the deafening fire-cracker celebrations of a Tendulkar century. Sport can offer few more spine-tingling sights and sounds than the 60,000 roar as Brett Lee charges in to bowl at the Boxing Day MCG. And that without an instrument or air horn in the vicinity. Crowd participation, in all its various guises, is important and generally to be encouraged. One of the overriding pleasures of touring the Caribbean, for example, in the days before us hacks were soundproofed behind glass, was to breathe in the spirit of the game there. Two years ago, the abandoned Test match at the new Sir Viv Richards stadium might have been regarded as a catastrophe were it not for the fact that spectators and players were given the opportunity, privilege more like, to witness a Test match at the Recreation Ground once more. To me, the pounding of Chickie Baptiste's disco that had the famous Double Decker stand vibrating like a springboard as the occupants jumped to the Soca and Calypso beats, and the incredible syncopation of the Iron band, whose members beat out a relentless rhythm on old car parts and metal pipes, provided the most scintillating environment of any cricket ground in the world, the very essence of how the game should be enjoyed \u2013 a key word \u2013 in uninhibited fashion. Having sanitised any semblance of this spirit in the 2007 World Cup, the ICC did a 180-degree turn for the recent World T20 with its mission statement \"Bring It\" and clawed some of that back. By and large, players enjoy the crowd interaction as well. Those in the recent round of Indian Premier League matches, for example, speak highly of the vibrant atmosphere in which the games were played and the inspiration drawn from it. There is a point though where noise can become intrusive, and, to some, counterproductive. I played in the Old Trafford Test of 1976 in which, on the Saturday evening, a barrage of intimidatory West Indies bowling was unleashed mercilessly at the England openers, and I still maintain that the relentless all-day cacophony of the rhythm section banging their beer cans together, combined with the hot, heavy sultry weather, created a particularly hostile atmosphere in the ground which conveyed itself to the players and contributed to the mayhem. And now we have the vuvuzelas. At Wantage Road, it was just a couple of kids and their enthusiasm. But shortly we are to embark on a series of sell-out ODIs against Australia. These instruments, if such they may be called, are the flavour of the moment and there will be no shortage of bright sparks who want to blow them throughout a match. Fortunately, they can dream on. All the county grounds have their own regulations (Lord's most stringent of the lot, largely through pressure from local St John's Wood residents) and, if Northants missed a trick, surely will have seen this coming. They should, and probably will, be confiscated. Nor will there be any in the cauldrons of the subcontinent during the World Cup next year: ICC has had a ban on such things for global events for a while now. And for that we can be thankful. Cricket busts a gut to try and emulate football's popularity, but the vuvuzelas we can leave where they are."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
