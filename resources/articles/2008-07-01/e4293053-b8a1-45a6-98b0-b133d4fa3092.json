Kennedy genuinely loves jazz (it is not just a cute hobby for him), and since his move to Poland, has found a regular hang out in Krakow's clubs. His Polish band joined him for the late Prom after his early-evening Elgar Concerto performance. As an improviser, Kennedy has an originality of spontaneous line and rhythmic attack that most classical players lack in this context, and several of the pieces worked up a fierce, guitar-mimicking, Hendrix-like momentum. But composed melodic surprises were rare - I kept longing for a devious twister rather than only the perplexingly unadventurous, frequently Latin-driven thrums of his current originals. A romantic ballad dedicated to 1960s folkie Donovan was sublime, and so was the darkly elegiac Hills of Saturn - the latter richly harmonised with Tomasz Grzegorski's tenor sax and Adam Kowalewski's bass. Surprise guest Jeff Beck conjured an astonishing panpipe-like sound from his guitar, Kennedy's blues-singing certainly didn't suggest a new career breakthrough, and Amy Winehouse's vocal sideman Xantone Blacq was mostly inaudible on Carnivore of the Animals. Considering the quantity of dazzling melodic ideas the classical Kennedy has been absorbing through every pore since childhood, its absence in his jazz composing is surprising. But it is clear he wants to party, and for about half the time his party is pretty good."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
