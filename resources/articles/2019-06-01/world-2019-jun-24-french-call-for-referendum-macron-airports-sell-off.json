The centrist French president wants to sell the state\u2019s controlling stake in A\u00e9roports de Paris, the profitable operator of Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports, which are used by more than 100 million passengers each year. It would be among the biggest privatisation operations in French history, alongside Macron\u2019s plans to sell other stakes in the national lottery as well as the gas and power group ENGIE. The privatisation on the Paris airports is a crucial part of Macron\u2019s modernisation plans for the French economy. A source close to the president said the state was not best qualified to run airport shopping and, with Charles de Gaulle ranked low for passenger experience, private managers could improve that. Profit from the sale \u2013 expected to be more than \u20ac7bn (\u00a35.5bn) \u2013 would be redirected into a new investment fund for startup companies and technology, and would also help plug the national debt. But political opponents accuse Macron of \u201cflogging the family silver\u201d and letting go of strategic state infrastructure. They say the UK, with its privatised Heathrow airport and privatised railways, illustrates a potential nightmare scenario of key transport infrastructure run for profit. In an extraordinary move, a highly unlikely coalition of French politicians who are normally each other\u2019s bitter enemies \u2013 ranging from communists and the hard-left to free-marketeers from Les R\u00e9publicains, Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s rightwing party \u2013 have joined force against the Paris airports\u2019 privatisation. They have been authorised by France\u2019s constitutional council to make the first ever use of a people\u2019s referendum mechanism introduced by Sarkozy in 2008. If they can get the signatures of 10% of the French electorate \u2013 4.7 million people \u2013 within the next nine months, a national referendum will be held for or against the airports\u2019 privatisation. \u201cIt would be the first time the people would be able to decide on such a massive issue of privatisation,\u201d said Laurent Russier, the communist mayor of Saint-Denis, north of Paris. At a time when gilets jaunes (yellow vests) anti-government protesters have called for more of a say in politics, and Macron has promised to listen more to citizens, a potential referendum is a test for French politics. A race is now under way to gather the 4.7m signatures. \u201cIt will be extremely difficult but not entirely impossible,\u201d said one campaigner, urging French voters from all regions and living abroad to sign. At least 17,000 signatures would be needed per day, but the government online platform for people to sign up is seen as difficult to use and prone to crashing. More than 200,000 people are estimated to have signed up since 13 June. This week, the first public meeting to garner support was held in a crowded trade union building in Saint-Denis. In the French capital\u2019s northern suburbs, Charles de Gaulle airport is a key employer. There were unusual scenes, with communist-voting trade unionists waving flags and applauding rightwingers whom they once would have jeered. \u201cThe public interest comes first,\u201d said Eric Coquerel of the hard-left party La France Insoumise (France Unbowed), arguing that it was not an anti-Macron political game, but a drive to protect state infrastructure. Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally was not invited to join the group, but she has urged her supporters to sign up to reach the 4.7m target. On the right, politicians said Macron was using the same arguments as the Thatcher government over Heathrow\u2019s privatisation in the 1980s \u2013 that there would be \u201cbetter services provided for airline passengers\u201d. Gilles Carrez, a rightwing lawmaker, said: \u201cMany major airports have stayed under state control. The obvious exception is Heathrow and today the British regret the privatisation of Heathrow.\u201d \u201cPollution,\u201d shouted a woman in the crowd, concerned over airport expansion like Heathrow\u2019s third runway. The historian Patrick Weil said: \u201cWe\u2019re in a third world war against the climate crisis, a battle which should be mobilising all of humanity. Selling A\u00e9roports de Paris to the private sector is like handing arms to our enemy.\u201d The recent months of gilets jaunes demonstrations have highlighted privatisation in France \u2013 particularly the private companies which run French motorways. Last autumn, gilets jaunes protesters blockaded scores of motorway toll booths around the country, expressing anger at the rise in toll prices since privatisation in 2005. Les R\u00e9publicains MP Philippe Dallier said: \u201cI bitterly regret supporting motorway privatisation and vowed to never make the same mistake [again]. That\u2019s why I\u2019m fighting Paris airport privatisation.\u201d Not everyone agrees. G\u00e9rard Lacher, a member of Les R\u00e9publicains and head of the Senate, said the referendum drive amounted to a hijacking of democracy. Among those who have already signed the petition for a referendum, Michel (surname withheld), 80, said: \u201cA referendum is a good thing because I don\u2019t trust politicians. The people should decide.\u201d Danielle (surname withheld) said: \u201cSelling off Paris airports is one privatisation too far. We\u2019ll end up looking like Britain in a Ken Loach film. An airport is not just about selling macarons or perfume \u2013 it\u2019s security and the environment.\u201d Claire (surnamed withheld) had worked in baggage-sorting at Charles de Gaulle for 25 years. She said: \u201cWe need to keep it human. It\u2019s not a profit machine.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
