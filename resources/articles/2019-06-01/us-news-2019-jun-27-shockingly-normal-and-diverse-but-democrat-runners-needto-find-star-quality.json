This might be the age of Donald Trump but, just for once, the master of outrage, trapped in the steel tube of Air Force One thousands of miles away, had to cede the limelight to his Democratic opposition. And for the politics of 2019, the 10 people on stage in Miami for the first Democratic primary debate seemed shockingly normal and refreshingly diverse, including three women, an African American and a Latino. Like the Republicans in 2016, the Democrats have a massive field, but there was no hurling of insults or boasting about the size of genitalia. Juli\u00e1n Castro telling Beto O\u2019Rourke off for not calling for fully decriminalising crossing the US-Mexico border was about as punchy as it got. There was little attempt to take down Elizabeth Warren, who was centre stage in every sense, and no mention of Joe Biden, the frontrunner who appears at the second debate on Thursday. But what remained less clear was who can outdo Trump\u2019s attention-grabbing, oxygen-sucking celebrity. These were 10, well, politicians, and he is something else. \u201cBORING!\u201d he tweeted from Air Force One, around halfway through. Democrats are still searching for Barack \u2013 or Michelle \u2013 Obama star quality. The man who once seemed destined for that role was O\u2019Rourke, who previously earned comparisons with Robert Kennedy and has declared he was \u201cborn to be\u201d in the race for the presidency. He began the debate with a mighty leap, suddenly switching to Spanish halfway through his first answer \u2013 and plummeted to earth. Senators Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren\u2019s looks of derision, as if suppressing mocking grins, were a meme in the making. A little later, O\u2019Rourke said he would not kill off private health insurance, prompting the first interruption of the night from the New York mayor, Bill de Blasio. The audience expected O\u2019Rourke to counter-punch, but former congressman John Delaney swooped in instead. \u201cI think we should be the party that keeps what\u2019s working and fixes what\u2019s broken,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, doesn\u2019t that make sense?\u201d He went on: \u201cWe should give everyone in this country healthcare as a basic human right for free. Full stop. But we should also give them the option to buy private insurance. Why do we have to stand for taking away something from people?\u201d Delaney has reportedly been studying past presidential debates to hone his techniques. It was also notable that De Blasio and O\u2019Rourke seemed to be the losers of that exchange, whereas Warren emerged unscathed. Yet it was she who championed Medicare for All, insisting: \u201cHealthcare is a basic human right and I will fight for basic human rights.\u201d Though she became less prominent as the night went on, she will be happy that she suffered no setbacks. It was also a good night for Cory Booker, the New Jersey senator, who, speaking for nearly 11 minutes, more than any other candidate, according to a Washington Post tracker, enjoyed a spike in Google search traffic and did not compare himself to Spartacus. Booker was composed and forceful on issues such as gun control, describing the violence that left seven people in his own urban neighborhood shot last week, and immigration: \u201cWhen people come to this country, they do not leave their human rights at the border.\u201d The former Obama administration housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro also performed strongly. Citing the photos of drowned Salvadoran father and his toddler daughter at the Rio Grande, he said bluntly: \u201cWatching that image of Oscar and his daughter Valeria was heartbreaking. It should also piss us all off.\u201d Candidates\u2019 rhetorical tics were also on full display. O\u2019Rourke constantly reminded us about people he had met on the campaign trial. Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii constantly made reference to her military service. Many found new ways of saying \u201cI\u2019m the only candidate on this stage who \u2026\u201d But that backfired for Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington, as a case of mansplaining. Inslee proclaimed he was the \u201conly candidate\u201d onstage who has signed a law protecting women\u2019s rights to abortion. The glare from Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota was for the ages. She retorted: \u201cI just want to say there\u2019s three women up here that have fought pretty hard for a woman\u2019s right to choose, I\u2019ll start with that.\u201d It was delicious. Klobuchar also aimed a well-timed jab at the occupant of the White House: \u201cI don\u2019t think we should conduct foreign policy in our bathrobe at five in the morning.\u201d Inslee had one too: \u201cDonald Trump is simply wrong. He says wind turbines cause cancer. We know they cause jobs.\u201d And when the candidates were asked what poses the biggest national security threat to America, there were predictable answers of China, Russia and climate change, but it was Inslee who gave the simple answer: Trump. Even so, the president, while a constant presence, did not overwhelm the occasion. It felt reassuringly normal. There were multiple auditions happening on stage at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts. Delaney made his pitch for health secretary, depending on who is president. Inslee has a good shot at EPA administrator. Others, like the squabbling Gabbard and Tim Ryan, might be hoping to land a job as a TV pundit. But it was a night of few zingers or breakout moments. And the biggest gaffe came from the least expected quarter: broadcaster NBC, whose microphones failed halfway through. Naturally, that caught the attention of reality TV star Trump, who wrote on Twitter: \u201cTruly unprofessional and only worthy of a FAKE NEWS Organization, which they are!\u201d Climate crisis or TV ratings? Only one matters to Trump. But in Miami, there seemed a possibility that politics might one day be normal again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
