At the end of the year, thinking I was now out of contract, I decided to switch my whole phone broadband package to TalkTalk. Be was informed I would be leaving, and contacted me with an improved offer in an attempt to get me to stay, which I did not accept. Despite this, Be continued to charge me for broadband services that it was no longer providing. When I queried this and stopped my direct debit, it claimed I would have to pay a further \u00a346.23 as I had not given it sufficient notice. I pointed out it was aware of my intention to leave, as evidenced by the improved offer to tempt me to stay. In September I was contacted, out of the blue, by a debt recovery agency claiming the sum of \u00a346.23 with threats of legal action. When I said I didn't owe this, the debt company responded with a near-unintelligible letter stating that Be refuted my version of events. I do not feel it is right that a firm should bully me like this. IF, Weston-super-Mare Yours was the first complaint we have had about Be, which is owned by the same company as O2, and appears to have one of the happiest customer bases in the broadband sector. It gets so few press complaints it doesn't even advertise a press number \u2013 which caused a few difficulties. When we did make contact, the company said: \"Our records show we offered a discounted package and the customer went away to consider before cancelling fully. The termination fee is necessary to cover the line-rental commitments for the broadband service if the normal notice period isn't followed. But we understand this was an innocent mistake, so we have cancelled this outstanding payment.\" The moral of this is: always tell your supplier you are leaving to avoid any misunderstandings later on.
