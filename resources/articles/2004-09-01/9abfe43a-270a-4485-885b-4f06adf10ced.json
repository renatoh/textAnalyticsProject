The challenge to the regulator's processes, launched by Sir Philip Watts, the former Shell chairman, reinforces a sense that the regulator is under siege. Everything the FSA does - the sensibility of its rules, the way it goes about investigations, how it decides on disciplinary action, the size of the fines, and even the procedure by which appeals are heard - is open to question. Until very recently, the received wisdom in the Square Mile was that so tough was the new regulatory regime - and so great the FSA's need to be seen to be clamping down - that the best course of action for anyone on the receiving end was to pay up and lie low. It was a case of quiet porridge or further public humiliation. Then the mad-hat financier, Paul \"The Plumber\" Davidson, came along and cried foul over a judgment that decided he had abused the markets. Then the split-cap brokers refused to cut a compensation deal. And then Legal &amp; General claimed it had been treated unfairly over endowment sales - a tribunal case which is in the process of being heard. The number of cases going through appeals has already outstripped the total heard in 2003 - a year which saw double the number of cases dealt with in 2002. The FSA may claim, rather glibly, that it wants to be busy and that all of these challenges are simply evidence that the City regulator is finally tackling behaviour that was allowed to continue unchecked for years. But the trend feels much more significant than that. The \"have a go\" culture that the CBI director general, Digby Jones, was having a go at on Sunday, bemoaning all those employment tribunal cases brought by aggrieved workers, has clearly moved up the food chain. The firms themselves are now challenging the new regulatory status quo - and with some real aggression. Which is where it begins to feel very uncomfortable. The big reputations of the financial world have the resources to defend those reputations to the last. The FSA, meanwhile, is trying to impose a very complex set of new rules on an increasingly complicated financial world. No wonder Howard Davies, Mr McCarthy's predecessor and principal architect of the rulebook, zipped off into the world of academia. It's the safest place to be at the moment. Oil spill Of course, there are other ways of looking at the Watts challenge - such as from the perspective of Shell. The stricken oil group is due to produce its big post-scandal strategic review next week - looking forward, rather than backward - and we can assume that the last thing it wanted now was to have all the detail of the corporate cover-up relating to years of overstated reserves played out once more in the media. Alternatively, the company may - conceivably - benefit. Among the whole range of issues being challenged by Sir Philip is the central question of whether Shell misled the market. If by chance the former chairman overturns that one, Shell could be off the hook with all those American investors queuing up to sue it. Gross capital On the subject of regulation, it is mildly amusing to see Stephen Carter, the chief executive of media super-regulator Ofcom (that's \"super\" as in \"big\"), justifying his \u00a3370,000 salary with the observation that he regulates a \u00a360bn sector. \u00a360bn? Pah! If the grossed-up market capitalisation of companies under a regulator's watch is going to be used as a pay measure, then Callum McCarthy at the FSA (on \u00a3224,000) and his chief executive, John Tiner (\u00a3472,000 last year), might well demand a rise. Box of ticks Corus chief executive Philippe Varin is not getting carried away by the company's first profit. He has his own boxes to tick: an investment grade rating, a re turn to the dividend list and turning two companies into one group. To date the boxes are empty, though clearly Corus is making progress and expects more. So does the City. Look no further than the share price, now a comparatively healthy 50p, compared with a bombed-out 3.5p of 18 months ago. The combination of rising demand and internal reorganisation should bring two of Mr Varin's targets within reach. But the third, a true merger, is more difficult to measure and achieve. In Britain, the unions are worried that Mr Varin is using a plan drawn up during the worst of times to guide Corus through - if not the best of times, at least a period when the market has taken a decisive turn for the better. In Holland, there are concerns about levels of investment. What Mr Varin has to do is show workers on both sides of the North Sea that he is, as he says, laying the foundation of growth, not managing decline."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
