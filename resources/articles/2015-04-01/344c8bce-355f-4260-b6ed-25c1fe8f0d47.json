Everton host United on Sunday almost exactly a year after David Moyes returned to his former club for what proved to be his final game in charge of the then reigning Premier League champions. Twelve months on United arrive at Goodison Park on a fine run of form, despite last weekend\u2019s defeat at Chelsea, and seeking to strengthen their claims on the final automatic qualifying place for the Champions League. The Everton manager, whose team have pulled away from relegation danger with four wins in their last five matches, claims Van Gaal will oversee further improvement at Old Trafford next season. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy to find the right formula at Manchester United after Sir Alex Ferguson retired,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said. \u201cI think what has been really interesting is how long it took to find the right formula but how competitive the team was all through that period. \u201cWhen we faced them at Old Trafford in October, if someone had said they would be favourites to finish above the champions, Manchester City, this season, I don\u2019t think you would have believed it. That shows you the incredible turnaround. I do think United will finish strong this season and they are capable of challenging for everything next season.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
