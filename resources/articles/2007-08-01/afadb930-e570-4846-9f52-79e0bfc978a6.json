Those deadly Daleks make it all worthwhile. Little Nicky (Steven Brill, 2000) 9.15pm, C4 Harvey Keitel's Satan is having a devil of a time. Two of his sons - Adrian (Rhys Ifans) and Cassius (Tom \"Tiny\" Lister Jr) - are so fed up when he refuses to retire that they storm out of hell for a good time on earth. Satan starts falling apart, and only his youngest, Adam Sandler's Nicky, can save the day. Another crass and crude Sandler comedy, with Reese Witherspoon's brilliant cameo offsetting Quentin Tarantino's rubbish one. Witchfinder General (Michael Reeves, 1968) 10.45pm, BBC2 A minor masterpiece of horror, with Vincent Price in his greatest incarnation of evil. He plays Matthew Hopkins, lawyer turned infamous witchfinder in the desperate civil war-torn England of 1645. Filmed on location in Suffolk, it brilliantly evokes a period of chaos and was the third and last of Reeves's films; he died, aged 24, of a drug overdose. Assault On Precinct 13 (John Carpenter, 1976) 12.20am, BBC1 Carpenter's low-budget cult masterpiece, decently remade in 2005, transposes Howard Hawks's Rio Bravo to modern LA. It has a motley band of cops and crooks besieged in a police station by a street-gang of crazies who come on like extras from Romero's Night Of The Living Dead: murky photography and Carpenter's own soundtrack enhance the edgy atmosphere. Sunday August 26 Things To Come (William Cameron Menzies, 1936) 2.45pm, BBC2 Alexander Korda's production of HG Wells' futureworld essay (Wells also co-wrote the script, and was a regular visitor on set) is a classic of British sci-fi. Set in an urban megapolis called Everytown, it envisages 100 years of totalitarianism, war, plague and, most presciently, given the approaching world war, the arrival of aerial blitzkrieg. The Importance Of Being Earnest (Oliver Parker, 2002) 9pm, BBC2 Another Oscar Wilde adaptation from Parker, but where An Ideal Husband rattled along swiftly and gleefully, his supercharged direction here tends to overpower even Wilde's wit. Still, he has assembled a top-quality cast: Rupert Everett is in his element as Algy, Colin Firth makes a fine, deceitful Jack, while Reese Witherspoon and Frances O'Connor show some modern manners. Mean Machine (Barry Skolnick, 2001) 10pm, C4 This remake of Robert Aldrich's crunching sporting drama treads very similar ground, with Vinnie Jones as a disgraced football star landing in prison and being persuaded by the governor (David Hemmings) to lead a no-hope team of cons against a select warders XI. It lacks the trenchant Aldrich assault on an authoritarian system, but nevertheless it is fun. The Relic (Peter Hyams, 1997) 11pm, BBC1 Something nasty lurks in the shadows of the Chicago natural history museum in this earthbound answer to the Alien series. Penelope Ann Miller is the scientist who realises there's a monster mutant out of South American mythology among the exhibits; Tom Sizemore the cop who finds himself hunting something rather nastier than your average serial killer. Monday August 27 The Rugrats Movie (Norton Virgien, Igor Kovalyov, 1998) 12.05pm, C4 The yukky but lovable toddlers of the TV cartoon series get a much bigger playground with their first feature film, and the result is fun for kids and adults. Jealous Tommy gets his pals to help him return his new baby brother to the hospital, but the job quickly goes pear-shaped. Planet Of The Apes (Franklin J Schaffner, 1968) 1.25pm, C4 Classic sci-fi, with three US astronauts crash-landing on a world ruled by apes. Charlton Heston's Taylor, captured by thuggish gorillas, rescued by more civilised chimps Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter, stumbles towards the awful truth, revealed in a quite startling climax. Full of suspense, gritty action and satirical intelligence, and on a far higher evolutionary plane than Tim Burton's remake. Ben-Hur (William Wyler, 1959) 1.30pm, Five Charlton Heston's noble profile was never put to better use than as bank holiday staple Ben-Hur, the lord who decamps from Romans to Christians around the time of the crucifixion. It's a heroic tale, punctuated by stunning, pre-CGI scenes such as the battle of the galleys and the famous, climactic, chariot race. The Flintstones (Brian Levant, 1994) 3.30pm, ITV1 Not quite a yabba-dabba-doo version of the 1960s TV cartoons, but better than a poke in the eye from a Stegosaurus. Bedrock is recreated in detail, complete with boulder-hewn cars (now there's a green option) and a rock-solid cast: John Goodman the perfect Fred, Rick Moranis as Barney, Elizabeth \"Weeds\" Perkins as Wilma. Anger Management (Peter Segal, 2003) 9pm, Five An intriguing clash of screen presences here: new kid Adam Sandler is a mild-but-seething-inside businessman who after a bit of a to-do on a plane is placed into the care of anger management guru Jack Nicholson. The eccentric doc prescribes round-the-clock treatment, turning on the charm for his patient's girlfriend (Marisa Tomei). For a time this is all good fun, sending up America's therapy obsession, but it runs out of ideas. Anchorman: The Legend Of Ron Burgundy (Adam McKay, 2004) 10.25pm, BBC1 Dumb but enjoyable 1970s-set comedy starring Will Ferrell as San Diego's ace TV news anchorman who is horrified when an ambitious female reporter (Christina Applegate) threatens his position in the male chauvinist newsroom. Would have made a decent half-hour sitcom but wears very thin over 90 minutes. Chinatown (Roman Polanski, 1974) 11.05pm, Five A faultless recreation of film noir, set in a dazzling 1930s Los Angeles shaded by the themes of evil and corruption that resonate in the Polanski psyche. Jack Nicholson is private eye JJ Gittes, Faye Dunaway the femme fatale, as a murder at a dam starts a tortuous trail towards lecherous old John Huston. Festival (Annie Griffin, 2005) 11.40pm, C4 A slightly tardy showing for writer-director Annie Griffin's sharp, Edinburgh Fringe-set satire.It's a gloomy but funny ensemble piece following a dozen or so performers, chief among them Steven \"Green Wing\" Mangan's deeply unlovable Sean - a neurotic comedian turned prize judge - his recovering alcoholic assistant Petra (Raquel Cassidy), and marvellous Lyndsey Marshal's Faith, with her one-woman Dorothy Wordsworth show. A sly delight. Raising Arizona (Joel Coen, 1986) 12 midnight, BBC1 Nicolas Cage is in his element as the world's worst robber who hitches up with prison warder Holly Hunter and steals one of a set of quins when the couple prove childless. Things go from bad to desperate when old convict buddies John Goodman and William Forsythe turn up: a typically wild Coen brothers farce. Tuesday August 28 Carrington VC (Anthony Asquith, 1955) 1.30pm, C4 One of Asquith's many stage-to-screen projects. Here it's Dorothy and Campbell Christie's play about the court martial of an army major on a trumped-up fraud charge. David Niven is his usual charming self as Carrington, betrayed by neurotic wife, Margaret Leighton in an engrossing drama. The Gorgon (Terence Fisher, 1964) 11.20pm, BBC2 Hammer was churning them out at this time, with Fisher the master of horror. Here the myth of the snake-haired creature whose gaze turns people to stone is transferred from ancient Greece to a dreary German village. Cast includes the top men, Lee and Cushing. Wednesday August 29 The Devil's Own (Alan J Pakula, 1997) 9pm, Five A Hollywood excursion into the troubles of Northern Ireland: don't expect too many insights. Harrison Ford is a humble Irish-American New York cop playing unwitting host to IRA man Brad Pitt, who's busy shipping missiles home. Pakula has made better thrillers, but the two stars play off well against each other. Brazil (Terry Gilliam, 1985) 11.20pm, BBC2 Gilliam's blackly comic take on Orwell's 1984. It's the story of Jonathan Pryce's Sam Lowry, a small cog in the great wheel that is the Ministry of Information in a shadowy, half-lit futureworld stacked and packed with heating ductwork. The rebel in the system is the legendary Tuttle, played by the legendary Robert De Niro. A brilliant, dizzying fantasy. Thursday August 30 The Cincinnati Kid (Norman Jewison, 1965) 1.35pm, Five The taut, atmospheric card-playing brother of Robert Rossen's 1961 pool movie, The Hustler. The game is stud poker, and Steve McQueen's Kid, challenger to The Man (Edward G Robinson) in a gruelling contest, is as charismatic a brash young gambler as hustling Paul Newman. The Sorcerers (Michael Reeves, 1967) 12.05am, BBC2 One of just three films made by the precocious Reeves before his untimely death. This isn't quite the cult classic that his Witchfinder General became, but it's still a brilliant psychedelic horror. Boris Karloff stars as Prof Montserrat, who, with dear Mrs M (Catherine Lacey), uses a mind machine to control the actions of swinging young Ian Ogilvy. Friday August 31 The Thomas Crown Affair (Norman Jewison, 1968) 1.35pm, C4 Steve McQueen's Thomas Crown is a highly successful businessman who gets his real kicks plotting the perfect caper; but he meets his intellectual and romantic match in Faye Dunaway's cool insurance investigator. The epitome of the stylish-but-silly 1960s thriller, comprehensively upstaged by the meatier 1990s remake with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo. Return To Me (Bonnie Hunt, 2000) 11.50pm, BBC1 It's a clever, if slightly queasy set-up: architect David Duchovny's wife Joely Richardson dies tragically; her heart goes to ailing transplant patient Minnie Driver; she and grieving Duchovny are then strangely drawn to each other... Once that's all under way, it's a standard, bland romcom."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
