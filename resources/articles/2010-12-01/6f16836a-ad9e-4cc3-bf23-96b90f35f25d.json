The administration of former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva publicly denied that militant Islamists were active in Brazil, even while its law enforcement agencies co-operated closely with the US in monitoring suspects. \"Despite publicly expressed sentiments of high-level officials denying the existence of proven terrorist activity on Brazilian soil, Brazil's intelligence and law enforcement services are rightly concerned that terrorists could exploit Brazilian territory to support and facilitate terrorist attacks, whether domestically or abroad,\" said a US embassy cable. The Americans lauded Brazil's \"excellent and improving\" collaboration and the upgrade of its counter-terrorism intelligence division to department level. Investigations focused on suspects in S\u00e3o Paulo, home to most of the country's estimated 1.3 million Muslims, and areas bordering Argentina, Paraguay, Peru, Colombia and Venezuela. The document may partly explain why Washington restrained its annoyance over Lula's friendship with his counterparts Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Iran. Lisa Kubiske, the US deputy chief of mission in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, noted approvingly that counter-terrorism intelligence was shared across the government, but said people around the president seemed to want to conceal the Islamist threat \u2013 and co-operation with the US \u2013 from the public. \"The senior levels of the Brazilian government, however, publicly deny the possibility that terrorist groups or individuals connected to such groups operate or transit through Brazilian soil and vigorously protest any claims made by US authorities to that effect. \"Officially, Brazil does not have terrorism inside its borders. In reality, several Islamic groups with known or suspected ties to extremist organisations have branches in Brazil and are suspected of carrying out financing activities.\" The report did not cite reasons for the government's denials but one possibility is sensitivity to Brazil's international image in the runup to hosting the football World Cup and Olympic Games. Kubiske said that in July 2009 the federal police's intelligence chief admitted to a congressional committee that an individual arrested for hate speech was linked to al-Qaida, \"contradicting the government's previous claims that there was no terrorism-nexus in the arrest\". She noted Brazil's \"unwillingness to speak out against anti-democratic actions\" in Cuba and Venezuela, and to address nuclear non-proliferation, an apparent reference to Iran."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
