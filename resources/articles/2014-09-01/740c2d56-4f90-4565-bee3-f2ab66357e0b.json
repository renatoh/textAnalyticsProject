I was alone on the Dodds, those little-visited hills to the north of the Helvellyn range, and not only saw nobody all day but hardly heard a sound either. Three miles away coach loads of tourists were noisily exploring Aira Force - I saw some of them on my way down - and I\u2019ve no doubt there were processions going over Helvellyn, but nobody else had thought it worthwhile going up into these fells which look more blank on the map than any other part of the National Park except perhaps the bleak country at the back of Skiddaw. True, there\u2019s nothing very exciting about the Dodds, for there are no crags except some down by the road, no tarns to speak of - just a couple of pools - almost no sculpturing of the mountain sides, little bracken and heather, just miles of grass. But in place of the normal attractions there are the loneliness, the quietude, the splendid turf which makes such easy going, and the feeling that you can look out, around the whole compass, at the bigger mountains as if from some upland promenade. Perhaps people knew these hills better 100 years ago, for last-century coaches travelled an old road that contours round and the passengers would at last peer up the hillsides and maybe knew who was the Mr Watson of Watson\u2019s Dodd. And a thousand years earlier men were digging into one corner for lead. But today nobody goes there."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
