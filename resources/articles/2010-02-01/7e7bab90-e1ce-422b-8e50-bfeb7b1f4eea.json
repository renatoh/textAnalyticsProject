There may be a more unlikely tackle than that made by Thomas on Sale's giant prop Eifion Roberts as he bore down on the try line but there will surely be none braver or more spectacularly effective. Leeds began solidly, recycling the ball through 20 phases of possession before Thomas dropped a simple goal, but the Sale crowd were on their feet soon afterwards when Roberts, having taken a pass close to the Leeds 10-yard line, displayed a neat sidestep and a remarkable burst of speed to beat the cover and barrel down the left touchline. Given the momentum of the 21-stone forward, and the proximity of the line, a try was already being celebrated when the relatively diminutive Thomas appeared from nowhere to smash his Welsh compatriot into touch. Sale were looking dangerous, though, and a try was not long in coming. Kristian Ormsby slotted into the line to make the extra man when the ball was moved left in the Leeds 22 and the flanker drove through a gap and over the line. Leeds could have done without losing Andy Gomersall to a leg injury on his 200th Premiership appearance but Scott Mathie proved a worthy replacement. The inspired Thomas made a 50-yard break and, though he was brought down just short of the line, his forwards followed up with a succession of drives which ended with Mathie burrowing over down the blind side. Thomas made the conversion from the touchline. In the second half Leeds, without being particularly inventive, continued to play solidly effective rugby. Sale appeared baffled and their discipline began to wane. Thomas kicked another penalty to put the visitors two scores clear, and their forwards forced several turnovers. The bottom of the table is closing up and Sale are far from secure. \"It was the tackle of Ceiron's career. We've never stopped believing we can get out of trouble and this was a performance which proves it,\" said Leeds' director of rugby, Andy Key. \"It was an incredible tackle, the sort that changes games, but we have no excuses. This is probably the lowest point of my coaching career,\" said his opposite number, Kingsley Jones.
