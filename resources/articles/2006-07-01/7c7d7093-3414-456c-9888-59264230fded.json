Padfield revealed that he has lodged a preliminary inquiry with Villa's operations director Steve Stride and anticipates setting up a meeting with the board, possibly as early as next week. He would not divulge any details about the consortium, known as AV06, but expects to begin talks if the feedback from Villa is encouraging. \"We have been in contact with the club,\" said Padfield, who was approached by the consortium to work on their behalf. \"We have made a preliminary inquiry. I have spoken to Steven Stride very briefly and that was just to make sure that our inquiry was received. I believe there will be a meeting. Whether it's next week, or the week after, or who it is with, I don't know. \"My role is to head the consortium and try and negotiate a bid if the consortium is satisfied with the answers to the questions that have been sent to the club. We want certain questions answered as to whether the club is in fact up for sale and what the position is as regards the team management and whether anyone has been appointed. Unless we have answers to those questions, then we don't know whether there is any solid base to proceed further.\" Those answers would appear to be straightforward, given that the managerial position remains vacant and the club has been up for sale for almost a year. There are, however, genuine doubts about Doug Ellis's willingness to relinquish control and that was evident to the American billionaire Randy Lerner, whose negotiations broke down on Wednesday. Villa had hoped that Lerner's interest could be revived but his spokesman Bill Bonsiewicz yesterday suggested otherwise. Bonsiewicz told the American media that \"his [Lerner's] interest is over\". A source close to Lerner, who owns the Cleveland Browns American football team franchise and has a personal wealth of about \u00a3640m, claims there is a small possibility the deal could be resurrected. Any future talks, however, would have to go through Rothschild, Villa's financial advisers, and Seymour Pierce, the corporate brokers working on behalf of Lerner, effectively taking Ellis away from the negotiating table. Should Lerner not re-enter the race, as is likely, the runners and riders will consist of three consortiums. Sven-Goran Eriksson's agent Athole Still is, despite reports to the contrary, involved in one of those consortiums, which consists of a group of investors drawn from several countries including England. Still, unlike Padfield and Michael Neville, the Solihull-based businessman who tabled an offer for Villa earlier in the week, has refused to comment on his intentions. Neville has yet to meet Ellis, though he insists that talks are expected in the next few days. He is conscious there needs to be progress next week if he is to have any chance of succeeding and he will seek to push a deal through. \"It needs to be brought to a conclusion as quick as is practically possible,\" he said. To aid that process Neville claimed yesterday that he would be willing to work with, and not against, Padfield's consortium. \"I have heard that [Padfield] is a Villa fan and, if that's the case, I don't know why he doesn't call me and say 'Why don't we join forces and get it done together?'\"said Neville. \"I would be willing to do that. There are no egos in this consortium and all I want to make sure is that Aston Villa is taken forward in the appropriate manner. If that means we have to join forces with one or two consortiums, then we would do it. Aston Villa is the priority not the egos of consortium members.\" Padfield's admission that \"my first love is Chelsea\" might put paid to those hopes. Furthermore Neville's willingness to work with another group suggests his own consortium might lack funding, though he rejected that suggestion. \"There's no need for us to join forces with anyone at all,\" he claimed. \"But the more consortiums that come in, the longer the process will take and probably the higher the amount of money that will have to be paid.\" That is unlikely to have escaped Ellis's attention. Consortiums in the running Randy Lerner The US billionaire started talks with Doug Ellis several weeks ago but left Villa Park on Wednesday evening exasperated after they broke down. Sources say Ellis attempted to haggle over an asking price already agreed, prompting Lerner to pull out. His interest appears over. Athole Still Sven-Goran Eriksson's agent remains tight lipped about his public outing at Villa Park on Wednesday. He was pictured leaving the ground and it was confirmed that he was heading a consortium seeking to gain control, although he refuses to comment on the nature of his business. Michael Neville The Solihull-based businessman is a lifelong Villa fan. He first expressed an interest in making a takeover offer 10 months ago when he headed a consortium financed by the Comer brothers. He is now part of an unknown consortium that has offered \u00a357m. Nicholas Padfield The deputy high court judge and barrister confirmed yesterday that he is heading a consortium which had made a 'preliminary inquiry'. He would not reveal any details about the group, known as AV06, but said he was not a Villa fan: 'I like the club but my first love are Chelsea.'
