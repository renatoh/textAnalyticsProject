Schumacher received the punishment after being held responsible for a multiple collision on the first corner of the German grand prix on August 3. Although the court confirmed the stewards' findings, it decided that the sanction imposed on the Williams-BMW driver was excessive and instead substituted a $50,000 (\u00a331,400) fine. It means that Schumacher, who holds fourth place in the title race with 53 points, 18 behind his brother Michael who leads in his Ferrari, still has an outside chance of challenging for the championship with four races - and a maximum of 40 points - remaining. It may also have a bearing on the constructors' championship, in which Williams are two points behind Ferrari. \"I was delighted with the decision,\" said Ralf Schumacher. \"After yesterday's hearing [he and the team made their case on Tuesday] I didn't expect too much but I am very happy with the conclusion that was reached. I think the team presented a very thorough case and this helped a lot, I am sure.\" Sir Frank Williams, the team owner, added: \"We are delighted that the FIA court of appeal saw fit to remove the serious penalty of a 10-place demotion on the starting grid for the next race. \"The hearing proved to be a fair and transparent review of all the factors that culminated in the incident.\" However, the court also heard evidence from the FIA technical and safety consultant Peter Wright, who had analysed the accident data recorders from the Ferrari of Rubens Barrichello and Kimi Raikkonen's McLaren, the other two cars involved in the incident at Hockenheim. As a result the court has decided that the case should be referred back to the panel of stewards at the German grand prix, so that the conduct of Barrichello and Raikkonen can be reconsidered in the light of Wright's evidence. Renault have confirmed that their driver line-up of Fernando Alonso and Jarno Trulli will remain unchanged for the 2004 season after the team principal Flavio Briatore described them as a \"fast and dependable\" partnership."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
