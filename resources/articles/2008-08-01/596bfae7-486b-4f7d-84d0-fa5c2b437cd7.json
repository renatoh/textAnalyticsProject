The club's manager, David Moyes, this week voiced his frustration at the threadbare nature of his squad, which he says requires \"five or six players\" to remain competitive. But Kenwright insisted it is a case of when, not if, the squad is strengthened. \"Whilst I can fully understand the sense of frustration being felt by our supporters in the wake of what some perceive to be a moratorium with regard to the signing of new players, I feel it is important to make a few points,\" he said on Everton's website yesterday. While the loan players Manuel Fernandes and Thomas Gravesen have gone back to their respective clubs and the striker Andy Johnson is on the verge of joining Fulham, no new talent has been brought in this summer, leading some to question whether the proposed move to a new stadium in Kirkby might be hampering the club financially. But Kenwright went out of his way to stress that investing in the playing squad is still a priority: \"Our attempts to complete the signings of players we believe will improve the quality of our first-team squad continues on an hourly basis. We have had a budget for incoming transfers since the start of the summer - and that budget is in no way reliant or dependent upon either the proposed relocation of the club to Kirkby or the sale of current players. \"Any proceeds from outgoing transfers will, you can rest assured, be added to the existing budget to strengthen our manager's hand as he seeks to enter the transfer market. \"David [Moyes] and myself have been trying throughout the close season to sign those players whom he believes will help to improve the squad which achieved so much during the last campaign. \"I appreciate that waiting can be hard and that patience is invariably in short supply but we do expect to make signings before the opening of the new Premier League season.\" Moyes, who has yet to sign a new contract, laid bare his frustrations on Thursday. \"We cannot hide the fact that we need new players at Everton,\" the manager said. \"It is OK getting fit but you have got to be able to play better. At the moment there is not enough competition for the players to realise that, if they play poorly, they will not be selected.\" Bernd Schuster, meanwhile, has said he sympathises with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's concerns about players being \"tapped up\", although the Real Madrid coach insisted yesterday that the Spanish club were not guilty of acting improperly when pursuing transfer targets. \"I think it's a very fashionable thing to start tapping young players in England,\" said Schuster, whose side are competing in the Emirates Cup at Arsenal this weekend. \"I think it's something that's happening all the time in the world of football. It's almost like anything goes.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
