State Schools Since the 1950s: the Good News, is the latest. It makes a simple case, based on evidence rather than the usual lazy prejudice that informs so much of the debate about education: schools have improved over the last half century, and the 1950s were not a \"golden age\" subsequently destroyed by social engineers. There may have been many wonderful schools and great teachers 50 years ago, but large numbers of working-class children went to secondary moderns, the higher social classes were clearly over-represented in grammar schools, and low expectations of children from poorer backgrounds were prevalent in all schools, whether selective or not. Home-school links were often minimal, and many children were taught an unstimulating curriculum in large classes and crumbling buildings by poorly trained teachers who regularly resorted to caning because, amazingly, children were badly behaved then, too. One 1950s pupil recalls: \"My friends amused themselves shooting cigarettes out of each other's mouths with a slug gun\". Many young people left school with low levels of literacy and numeracy, which partly explains why so many adults are struggling with maths and English today even though they were educated in the \"golden age\". In 1959, around 9% of 16-year-olds got five or more O-levels, and more than a third of grammar-school pupils failed even to get three. All this in an age when society was arguably more stable and schools didn't have to take responsibility for coping with family breakdown, mental-health issues and the influx of non English-speaking pupils. Heard of the book? Probably not. It doesn't satisfy the media appetite for gorging on bad news. It doesn't use the weaknesses of the least successful state schools to characterise the entire sector, while allowing the gleaming spires of the top public schools as cover for much that is mediocre in private education. Instead, it uses evidence from our highly scrutinised system to paint a picture of slow, but steady, improvements in standards, teaching and leadership, and of comprehensive schools that, far from failing, often create respectful, tolerant atmospheres, in which children learn to be good citizens as well as pass exams. What is more, parents are largely satisfied with their children's schools. Too many children do still underachieve, just as they did in the 1950s. Many of those children have complex needs and are overly represented in some schools, but we have got better at addressing those needs, which is why it was disappointing that Gordon Brown used a major speech on education to flag up alleged failure, rather than success. It must be tempting to play to the gallery in the Daily Mail, whose contribution to the education debate is also examined in this book; over a three-month period, there were 25 major education stories, 20 of which were negative, three neutral and two positive (and one of those was a letter from a reader). But giving ammunition to those whose interests are served by the myth that the state can't run decent public services demonises children and communities, and acts as a disincentive for teachers and parents to support schools that are often doing a good job in challenging circumstances. I don't know Adrian Elliott, the former headteacher who wrote this book, but I am a fan. His evident pride in what has been achieved is rightly tempered by warnings against complacency, but is still refreshing set against the baleful cynicism of the media about the current generation of schools and pupils. If I were a new prime minister keen to promote a sense of progress and optimism about the future, I know whose view I would prefer. \u00b7 State Schools Since the 1950s: the Good News, by Adrian Elliott, published by Trentham Books"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
