As an Irishman living in England, I may not be in the best position to sound off about the way the RFU have handled things over the past couple of months, since Ireland's management situation is very much in the balance with Eddie O'Sullivan's recent departure from his role as head coach. But, all the same, it would be impossible not to say that Brian Ashton has been treated very harshly. The damage was done when he was awarded that one-year rolling contract after the World Cup. That was not a sensible decision, the reverse of the IRFU's unwise decision over O'Sullivan, who was awarded a four-year contract before the World Cup had even started. I feel sorry for Ashton about the way he has been treated, but I think Martin Johnson will do a great job if he gets the right people around him. Because there is some real talent around in English rugby. We've got some youngsters knocking around here at London Irish - John Fisher and Alex Corbisiero are two who were on the England under-20 team that won the grand slam this year - and that's before we've even mentioned the other more famous examples, such as Shane Geraghty and my partner in the second row, Nick Kennedy. English rugby has a bright future. It's just a question of harnessing that, and I think Johnson could be the man. I just hope he doesn't poach Mike Catt from us as his backs coach. We were made aware of Catty's comments that he might be on for the job only on Thursday and we were wondering why so many of the press were hanging round the training ground last week. We love having Catty at London Irish - he's a massive asset for us, whether he's playing or coaching. The boys are very fond of him. Hopefully we'll keep hold of him, but I'm sure if his country come calling he'll find it very difficult to say no. The same would be true if Ireland ever came calling for me, which they haven't done for nearly eight years now, when I won the last of my five caps under Warren Gatland. Gatland's gone on to great things since, of course, but he lost his job under dubious circumstances to O'Sullivan in 2001. People over here have kindly said that they have found my exclusion strange, but I have to be realistic and the truth is that Ireland have so much talent at lock - Paul O'Connell, Donncha O'Callaghan and Malcolm O'Kelly are outstanding players. Ultimately, though, it was one man's decision and I just didn't fit in with O'Sullivan's plans. Hopefully now, with someone else in charge, I might get back in. They reckon it's probably going to be Declan Kidney, which would be a great call. He's very well respected in Ireland and gets the best out of his players. He has also won the Heineken Cup with Munster and will take them to their semi-final against Saracens next weekend, the day after we take on Toulouse at Twickenham. If we could only get to the final, we would happily take on whoever was waiting for us, but wouldn't it be great to face Munster? Not that we've even had time to think about Toulouse yet. Our Heineken Cup run has been a highlight of our season, but first and foremost we have to concentrate on qualifying for next season's event. Last week we were focusing purely on yesterday's Premiership match with Harlequins. Only this week will we turn our minds to Toulouse. It's the nature of rugby in this country, with the Premiership being so important, and the arguments will go on about whether it is the right way for elite players to be going about things. Personally, I love playing high-stakes rugby every weekend - it's what you get paid for and I relish the competitiveness of it. But it is a strain for a small squad like ours. If players have niggles, they have to play, whereas in the Magners League they would most likely be rested. I won the Celtic League, as it was then, with Leinster, and they look set to win it again this year. But for the Irish provinces the Heineken Cup is everything and the Celtic League is second best, which means your season revolves around six games, more if you're lucky. Your level of performance in the Heineken Cup goes up massively. But whether that is good for elite players is an interesting question. Ireland, Wales and Scotland didn't do well in the World Cup. Was that because they weren't used to playing high-intensity rugby one week and then having to raise themselves again maybe only five days later? For us, Toulouse are coming to town in less than a week and we're going to have to raise ourselves. They are massive favourites, but I think it'll be a great contest, with both of us liking a fast game with ball in hand. Some will say that we're lucky to have got this far, that it was due to an easy draw. But we're not too bothered by that. I'm a huge Liverpool fan and when they won the Champions League I didn't care that they were only fifth in the Premiership at the time. I have a personal ambition to make the Ireland squad and our aim at London Irish is to become Heineken Cup regulars. A great performance on Saturday would go a long way to satisfying both ambitions.
