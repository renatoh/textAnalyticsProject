Installed as chief executive of the British Paralympic Association (BPA) last month, he is charged with delivering a highwire act with a year remaining until the Games. Not only must he ensure an avalanche of medals for the contestants, but he must also help to achieve one of the most ambitious legacy aims among a panoply of lofty government targets attached to London 2012. \"While the Games itself will continue to grow, we will never have the same profile and the same shop window that we do now. We will have to make sure the next year is absolutely maximised,\" said Hollingsworth, formerly chief operating officer at UK Sport, the funding body for Olympic and Paralympic sport. It has become obligatory for all involved in British sport to describe the Games as a \"once in a lifetime\" or \"one-off opportunity\", but Hollingsworth says it with more feeling than most. His most immediate task is to deliver on the expectations forged at Beijing, where Team GB finished second in the medal table and notched up 42 golds. To that end, the latest Paralympics GB simulation camp in Bath has in recent weeks been attempting to prepare British athletes \u2013 who will number a record 300 in 2012 \u2013 for the unique experience awaiting them next summer. But if 2008 represented a step change in the amount of coverage and recognition afforded to Paralympic athletes, the ambition for London is to take it to a permanently higher plane. At UK Sport, Hollingsworth played a role in rescuing a sponsorship programme designed to fill a hole in the budget, and forging long-term partnerships with sponsors such as Sainsbury's, BT and Deloitte will be one priority. But it is also clear he envisages the BPA playing a bigger role in the wider Paralympic landscape. He wants the organisation to play a role in ensuring the \"catalyst\" of the Games is used to improve facilities, coaching and access to Paralympic sport and \u2013 beyond that \u2013 to deliver on the previous government's bold promise to use it to change perceptions of disability. \"There are huge challenges. Our key role as an organisation is to create the inspiration for that,\" Hollingsworth added. \"Everyone recognises the opportunity is too good to miss.\" Acknowledging the huge job to be done, both in terms of explaining sports such as Boccia and goalball to the public, and raising the profile of the athletes, Hollingsworth admits there will be thorny challenges. The classification system that caused such controversy in Beijing must be explained to the public but not obsessed over, he believes. There are also a range of views about how best to promote Paralympic sport and athletes.' \"Without question, you start with the sport. If you listen to someone like David Weir [the five-time London wheelchair marathon winner], you know the world-class mentality is exactly the same. We have to first get a message across about the ability of the athlete and the fantastic nature of the sport. But the element that sits behind that is the inspiration that can be drawn. If you see it as elite sport you can then look beyond that to the story of how that particular athlete got there, and also the inspiration that can give you to take on challenges.\" On the participation of \"blade runner\" Oscar Pistorius in the world athletics championships, Hollingsworth is unsurprisingly supportive of the South African. \"Oscar Prestorius is a supreme athlete. There is no one else running on the blades he's got that is running anything like the times that he is. If that were not the case, you might question whether there is something to be looked at.\" But Hollingsworth concedes his answer might be different if an athlete turned their back on Paralympic competition: \"The wider context is that I do believe the Paralympics is a parallel competition. To believe that, you have to believe that it's the pinnacle of an athlete's career.\" This week London organisers will ramp up their efforts to promote the 1.5m Paralympic tickets available to the public, ahead of International Paralympic Day on 8 September and the launch of applications on 9 September. Hollingsworth says at this stage he \"doesn't care\" what the buyers' motivation is, even if it is just because they missed out on Olympic tickets and want to see the venues. \"Ideally, I want it to be because they know the competition and the athletes, and purely for that reason. In some cases it will be, and that's the job we've got over the next year. But I know from my own experience that just being there is what creates the change. Seeing and experiencing Paralympic sport is transformational.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
