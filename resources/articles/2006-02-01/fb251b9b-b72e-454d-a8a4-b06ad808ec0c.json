The incident took place last week, after Thomson's team came across a school that was being burned by the Taliban. As the Channel 4 News team arrived a group of Talibs emerged from behind the burning school and threatened to kill them. Just as the situation appeared to be calming down, the Afghan army opened fire, with the intention of ambushing the Talibs. Caught in the middle, the Channel 4 News team's translator was beaten by Afghan army soldiers wielding rifle butts. He is now recovering in hospital in Kabul. Thomson's report on the incident is broadcast during tonight's 7pm Channel 4 News bulletin. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
