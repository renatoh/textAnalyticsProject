When asked what brought them out to vote, their differing reasons exemplified a starkly divided electorate. These interviews have been edited for clarity and length. North Carolina Julius Kemp, 25 How are you feeling? After voting today and after the last presidential debate yesterday, I\u2019m pretty stern with my vote still being Joe Biden. What is driving you to vote this year? The need for change. We\u2019ve had the last four years with President Trump and giving him a chance and Covid happening and it being such a sweep of a whole entire year of 2020 \u2013 a lot of expectations didn\u2019t get met. That probably would be my biggest thing as far as understanding where we\u2019re at as a nation and understanding where we want to go in the next four years. I think it was definitely the need for someone else to step into power. Who are you voting for? Biden. Mario Robinson, 34 How are you feeling? I\u2019ll be glad when it\u2019s over. What is driving you to vote this year? Well, one, it\u2019s a civil right. Two, just wanting to see more growth and change with the current climate. The police brutality is one thing. I actually am a business owner in Charlotte, and seeing the looting and the other things that was going on, I actually came out here and protested three straight nights. I got to see it actually first-hand from both sides. There are a lot of people who may not come out publicly because they don\u2019t want to be ridiculed, but it\u2019s a lot of African American especially business owners you know who have had success here in Charlotte that are gonna vote for Trump. I think it\u2019s gonna be a lot closer than people expect. Who are you voting for? Donald Trump. Ruth Shaw, 72 How are you feeling? I\u2019m very excited to cast my vote in this election. I think we\u2019re due for a change. What is driving you to vote this year? I vote every year, and what drives me to vote is the right to do so, and that\u2019s the chance to make my voice heard. I\u2019m particularly interested in all of the social and environmental issues. Those are the ones that are the nearest and dearest to my heart. And I\u2019ve been deeply concerned to see the erosion of environmental regulations. Who are you voting for? I voted for Joe Biden very proudly. Jordan Fenlason, 21 How are you feeling? It\u2019s very suspenseful. It just stinks to see the country torn, you know? What is driving you to vote this year? I definitely have strong beliefs and values, and I feel like it would be neglectful not to vote for those. I\u2019m a young business owner actually, and I think a lot of the tax reform that Biden is possibly proposing would absolutely just wipe me and some of my other young entrepreneur friends out. It\u2019s really cool that it\u2019s my first year voting as well, and it\u2019s such a pivotal election. Who are you voting for? Trump. Andrew Lax, 65 How are you feeling? I\u2019m glad I got it done and there was no line. Very relieved to have gotten it done. What is driving you to vote this year? Well, I like Biden and I hate Trump. Other than that I think we need to undo what\u2019s been done. Coronavirus and environment and climate change. Who are you voting for? Joe Biden. Parker Wilson, 41 How are you feeling? I feel pretty good to go out and do my civic duty. Obviously I think this is a super important election. What is driving you to vote this year? I mean, there\u2019s so many things right now. Like I said, I think it\u2019s a huge, important election. Being of mixed racial background, I think the racial environment around the country is really in a bad spot. I feel like our leadership is not really doing a great job with that. I\u2019d like to see a change as far as that\u2019s concerned. The response to the coronavirus is obviously a big topic as well. Who are you voting for? Biden. Windoll Gardner, 75 How are you feeling? I\u2019m feeling really good after the debates last night. What is driving you to vote this year? I vote every time I get a chance, because it is my right, and I can\u2019t complain if I don\u2019t vote, so here I am. I also voted for the economy and freedom. Who are you voting for? Trump. Pennsylvania Connie Santos, 65 (with granddaughter Aria) How are you feeling? I\u2019m feeling empowered. What is driving you to vote this year? Well, actually, I hadn\u2019t planned on going to the polls. However, I did not receive my mail-in ballot so that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. Who are you voting for? I absolutely voted for all Democrats, down the line. Monica Johnston, 75 How are you feeling? Good. Happy. Voting\u2019s important. What is driving you to vote this year? The character \u2013 the lack of character of our top officials, and the coronavirus, and concerns about social security and Medicare. Who are you voting for? Biden. Joyce Narciso, 81 How are you feeling? Well, I feel it\u2019s a very, very important election after all the discrepancy and the different things you hear on the news. I voted all my life \u2013 I think it\u2019s very, very important for people to vote. It\u2019s our country and I want to keep it the way it is. What is driving you to vote this year? Social security and exactly what Monica said. Monica: Well, I said the character of the top officials. Joyce: Well, that\u2019s true too, almost the same thing \u2013 the characters of who I really think should get in. Who are you voting for? Donald Trump. Together: There\u2019s the two of us \u2013 you\u2019re a Biden [to Monica], and we\u2019ve been friends forever. [Laughter.] Every once in a while we get in an argument but it never affects us. Melvin Howard, didn\u2019t give age How are you feeling? I\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine. What is driving you to vote this year? I always vote. Who are you voting for? That\u2019s private. C\u2019mon now. Always private. Susan Samuel, 52 How are you feeling? I am fabulous, blessed and highly favored. What is driving you to vote this year? Because I feel that it\u2019s a responsibility as a US citizen to vote. Being an African American woman, I\u2019m also an educator, and I\u2019m teaching students about voting and the importance of it \u2013 from the Voting Rights Act to civil rights, what our ancestors have gone through, and it wasn\u2019t just people of color, it was all people that felt it wasn\u2019t right. As Lyndon Johnson said: \u201cWe shall overcome.\u201d So I feel it\u2019s an honor standing on those who have died and were beaten, like congressmen \u2013 and God bless his soul \u2013 John Lewis, whose skull was fractured so that I could walk in freely and have the choice to do it without having to go through that. It\u2019s an honor to be here today. Who are you voting for? Biden and Kamala. Just even Kamala Harris being the first woman. The US is behind in the times. Debbie Tice, 61 How are you feeling? I feel great. What is driving you to vote this year? Well, this is a very crucial election. I\u2019m a Democrat by party, but I have voted for Republican presidents, I have voted for Democrat presidents, and really to me it\u2019s about who will lead the country and serve, you know, to help all people. And I felt like this election is probably one of the most important elections that I have ever faced in my lifetime. Who are you voting for? I voted for Biden, absolutely, I think he\u2019s the better choice as far as experience, policies, you know, just overall understanding where this country is and where it needs to go. Again, I don\u2019t necessarily vote along party lines, but in this election I picked the man that I thought would really be the best for our country and all of us, including myself, my husband, my children, my grandchildren. Michael Byrne, 26 How are you feeling? Average. What is driving you to vote this year? Honestly, I\u2019m not much of a political person, but I feel like \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 I don\u2019t really do much of this sort of thing. So I just filled out the ballot just based on what I\u2019m hearing, what I\u2019m seeing. I want to at least contribute to something. Who are you voting for? Democrats. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say about that. Michigan Angela Hence, 38, with daughter, Jada, six How are you feeling? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just up in the air. I have no idea. What is driving you to vote this year? I vote every year. Who are you voting for? I voted for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. I really like Kamala Harris. I like the fact that she\u2019s more personable. Jerry Brock, 45 How are you feeling? I am feeling confident that on election night the correct person will be elected for four more years! What is driving you to vote this year? This is gonna be probably the most epic election ever. It seems like everything\u2019s split right down the middle right now. Who are you voting for? Donald Trump . There\u2019s so many reasons. This Democratic side right now to me is so far left, and Trump has done everything that he said he was gonna do from the moment he was elected till now. He produces results. Diana Peagler, 68 How are you feeling? I\u2019m excited because the sleeping giant \u2013 which is the public \u2013 they\u2019re finally getting how important democracy is for the quality of our lives. What is driving you to vote this year? When I was a teenager I always looked forward to being able to register to vote. That took me toward my adulthood. And I\u2019ve always voted. You couldn\u2019t live in my house if you didn\u2019t vote. Who are you voting for? It should be a no-brainer: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Because they get it. And people have seen the quality of our lives just deteriorate. Every segment of our society has had a chance to be punished and brutalized by this current administration. And that\u2019s not America. Samantha, 23, and Jacob Boida, 25 How are you feeling? Samantha: I feel on edge. Jacob: I don\u2019t really blame people for voting Trump in 2016 because the DNC handled it extremely poorly.Trump has a lot of \u201cplans\u201d but no policy. [But] it\u2019s been exhausting and very sad seeing people be used and forgotten as soon as [Trump] gets what he wants. What is driving you to vote this year? Samantha: This country is very divided right now and we all need to remember we are together in all of this. Also, that Black lives matter! Jacob: Our parents have always really pushed the right to vote. It\u2019s something that you should always go out and do and be informed about. Who are you voting for? Samantha: I voted for Biden. To be honest he wasn\u2019t really my first choice when all of the candidates came out. But I feel like I would have much rather had him, somebody who actually cares about personal goals and the people who are lower class \u2013 who are actually being taxed like crazy \u2013 when big corporations are paying maybe even less than what we\u2019re paying for taxes. Jacob: I voted for Biden. He\u2019s not a perfect candidate, no candidate will be, but I personally just feel like the dissension that our current president is creating just can\u2019t go on for another four years. David Millar, 31 How are you feeling? It is absolutely absurd that we have to deal with what we\u2019re currently dealing with. What is driving you to vote this year? It\u2019s so easy for us to be manipulated by social media and that\u2019s where our political climate actually comes from today. Now, I still don\u2019t believe that either candidate, either primary candidate with the Republicans or Democrats, are viable candidates. Who are you voting for? Howie Hawkins. A lot of people will call me stupid, they\u2019ll call me ignorant, \u2018They\u2019re never going to get elected.\u2019 It\u2019s that mentality that prevents us from actually getting some form of change. Do you know how dumb we look because we only have two primary parties and these primary parties are now so polarized and divided? We\u2019re not gonna get anywhere when we\u2019re so polarized that even if we do vote for a change you\u2019re never gonna get anywhere. Filippo Leone, 60 What is driving you to vote this year? I wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world. I made all my kids register to vote and make sure that they all vote for Trump. Who are you voting for? I am a huge Trump fan, and I think he\u2019s the best president we ever had. Why? The economy, you know, he\u2019s just common sense. Wisconsin Tija Simitz, 18 How are you feeling? I\u2019m nervous and excited for the election. I\u2019m excited for the outcome and to see what happens especially in Wisconsin, as a swing state and what happened in 2016. What is driving you to vote this year? I\u2019m seeking change, and I\u2019m really passionate about this election more than anything. And I know that my age group is underrepresented usually in the polls. Who are you voting for? Biden/Harris. Ada Donnelley Tower, 18 How are you feeling? Proud. It was my first presidential election that I\u2019ve ever voted in, so it\u2019s really cool to actually be able to see my views put into action. What is driving you to vote this year? This is probably the most important election in a very, very, very long time, so I wanted to make sure that I was able to put in my vote for who I thought should win. Who did you vote for? Biden. Chasee Boyd, 22 How are you feeling? I\u2019m feeling good. Excited to see some new people out early voting. What is driving you to vote this year? A lot of things bring me out to vote. It\u2019s probably the most important election of our generation and I think it\u2019s just to use your voice and get out there and vote for people who don\u2019t have the ability or don\u2019t have the representation in office in the last four years. Who did you vote for? Biden. Shane Scott, 66 How are you feeling? Great. I\u2019ve been a blue Democrat all my life and I never thought I\u2019d ever see anything like this. What is driving you to vote this year? To get rid of him. I\u2019ve always liked Joe and I know he can step in and we know we need a national mask mandate. We\u2019ve had seatbelt laws \u2013 with matters of public health you surrender a certain amount of your rights. I have no right to make you sick. I have an obligation to you. I have an obligation to the community. If one of my loved ones struggles to breathe and ends up intubated and ends up dying, it\u2019s squarely at Trump\u2019s feet. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. Who did you vote for? Biden. Henry Morrison, 19 How are you feeling? I think I\u2019m a little bit nervous. I hope my candidate wins, but I\u2019ve felt that before and it hasn\u2019t always worked out. What is driving you to vote this year? Mainly the environment. I think just being young and knowing that so many fossil fuels are being burned. The world is definitely going to need someone now and in the future who cares about the planet that I\u2019m going to live in and my kids and grandkids. I think that\u2019s very important now. Who are you voting for? Voting for Biden. Gloria Krejci, 50 How are you feeling? I\u2019m happy to come and vote. I know that they want my vote so that\u2019s why I decided to come early and vote. What is driving you to vote this year? I just really want to vote. I am a qualified voter. I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings if I say who I\u2019m going to vote for because [I have been a] Republican from the beginning. Who are you voting for? I\u2019m just voting for Trump still. Even though there\u2019s a lot of people against him. Eric Johannsen, 53 How are you feeling? I think it\u2019s really important. It\u2019s the most important election we\u2019ve had in a long time. What is driving you to vote this year? I want my vote to count, and frankly I want to send Donald Trump home. Who are you voting for? Voting for Biden. Sally Johannsen, 53 How are you feeling? I think it\u2019s the most important election. We\u2019re fighting for the soul of our country, and if we don\u2019t vote we can\u2019t change things that are unacceptable to us. What is driving you to vote this year? Most of all I\u2019m thinking about my young daughters . I want them to grow up knowing that there\u2019s power within them and each individual, that we get to choose our leaders. It never should be a dictatorship. Democracy is very important. I grew up in Montreal, and when I was a young girl around their age a political party took over. We were English, they were French, and overnight it became a dictatorship. And that\u2019s what I see happening in this country if Trump gets re-elected. And if he does we will probably move back to Canada, because this is not where I want to raise my daughters. Who are you voting for? Voting for Biden."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
