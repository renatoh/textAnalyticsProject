Folk who get angry on social media disgraces about which footballer has the \u201csickest tekkers\u201d took to their bedrooms to watch the Ballon d\u2019Or awards, the annual jamboree in which footballers squeeze into ill-fitting suits and pretend to be happy for rival players who rank higher than them in the voting to determine, playground-style, who are the most top, top, top footballers in the world. In case you haven\u2019t heard, Megan Rapinoe won the women\u2019s shiny gold gong for the first time, and Lionel Messi won the men\u2019s for a record sixth time. Confirmation then, that old people are better than young people. Predictably, some people felt fresh and funky about the list for the men\u2019s award. Former Newcastle and Aston Villa full-back Habib Beye accused the judges of racism after Sadio Man\u00e9 came fourth, behind teammate Virgil van Dijk. \u201cWhoever tells me that Van Dijk had a better season than Man\u00e9, give me your criteria please. Speak with me, and we can debate,\u201d he roared. \u201cMaybe people will see this as victim culture. But he [Man\u00e9] is African and that is why he is fourth. You can look at it in every way, but that is why he is fourth. Messi disappeared during [Big Cup] semi-final at Anfield. At the same moment, Man\u00e9 and the others went into the final, won the tournament \u2026 to see Man\u00e9 fourth is a scandal, pure and simple.\u201d The presence of Cristiano Ronaldo at third on the list got people who ought to have a proper look at themselves angry too. Ronaldo has placed first or second for the past eight years, but Van Dijk pipped football\u2019s leading current underpants model to second this time round. Ronaldo didn\u2019t even bother pitching up in Paris. He chose to have his ego massaged at the Serie A gongs instead. When asked about the Juve striker\u2019s absence, Van Dijk honked: \u201cWhy? Was he a candidate?\u201d It was a joke, not a good one, which is why it\u2019s in The Fiver, but it still prompted the tanned one\u2019s sister and Piers Morg@n to lose the run of themselves late on Monday night. \u201c@Cristiano is a far better player, you\u2019re not in his league,\u201d nah-nah-nah-nah-nahed the 54-year-old man. Ronaldo\u2019s sister Katia Aveiro, 42, went further, penning an open letter to the Liverpool defender on Instachat. \u201cDear Virgil, where you are going, Cristiano Ronaldo has gone and has come a thousand times,\u201d she began. \u201cYou see, my dear Virgil, that Cristiano Ronaldo was a tri-champion in the country where you have been playing for years and you still haven\u2019t got your hand on the trophy. Cristiano Ronaldo was even the best player and best scorer in the country where you play, Virgil. By the way, he was even younger than you.\u201d Perhaps it\u2019s time we hoofed these golden balls into touch.

FIVER LETTERS \u201cAs an antidote to the utter tedium of the annual Ballon d\u2019Messi, how about The Fiver launching its own award? Honouring the fast-paced soap opera of managerial sackings, The Fiver\u2019s \u2018Ballon out the d\u2019Or\u2019 ceremony could be held at Vicarage Road. The award itself would be a gold-painted, recycled exit sign, bearing the legend \u2018Do One\u2019 in the font of your choice. What\u2019s not to like?\u201d \u2013 Mark Husbands. \u201cAs a footballing nation that has founded its youth development policies on grown men bellowing expletives at children, officials and other grown men, while simultaneously becoming obsessed with tactics and analysis to pedantic levels, I feel a closer examination of the Ajax U-12s\u2019 50-1 demolition of MVV Maastricht (yesterday\u2019s News, Bits and Bobs) is surely required. I mean, how can a team that racks up an almost 50-goal advantage be so slack at the back as to let the opposition score? A little less praise for such shoddy defending might do those Dutch tyros a world of good\u201d \u2013 Colin Reed. \u201cRe: Richard O\u2019Hagan claiming The Fiver was of use as a Scrabble clue (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters). I would like to disabuse Mr O\u2019Hagan of the misconception that The Fiver can claim responsibility for being useful. The etymology of the word \u2018fiver\u2019 certainly predates the tea-timely spam-clogging column. When I checked Wikipedia, it stated that \u2018fiver\u2019 may refer to, among other things, \u2018a humorous daily football email by the Guardian\u2019. I have, of course, raised an accuracy dispute. I noted that one of the criteria for raising a dispute included, content that \u2018\u2026 has been written (or edited) by a user who is known to write inaccurately on the topic\u2019. I\u2019d be grateful if The Fiver could inform me how to raise a dispute on similar grounds in relation to its daily tea-time email\u201d \u2013 James Megaw Wilson.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS The FA Cup third-round draw has paired Liverpool with Everton, as per, and AFC Fylde with Sheffield United, in a rather less common match-up. Richarlison is close to agreeing a new five-year deal with Everton, despite Manchester United and others sniffing around. \u201cWe don\u2019t see other clubs who want to grow selling their best players,\u201d tooted Magic Marco. Talking of under-pressure bosses, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r insists he isn\u2019t one despite the spate of recent sackings. \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t make me more concerned. It\u2019s that time of year,\u201d he roared, donning a Santa hat. Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin accepts more needs to be done to combat racism in European football, while also calling out Boris Johnson. And FA suits have compared diaries with their counterparts in Austria and Romania and arranged an away friendly in Vienna on 2 June and a home one at whatever venue they can book on 7 June against the Romanians.
