He started the season with a win in Australia but was unlucky as potential victories in Malaysia and Brazil slipped away. Still sufficiently fit and motivated to deliver the results, even if he has to battle with a determined team-mate in Kimi Raikkonen. Ralph Firman (28, Jordan-Ford) Has enjoyed a handful of high spots during his maiden season, most notably a fourth-fastest time in the rain during first practice for the Canadian grand prix and a first world championship point from eighth place in Spain. Has tended towards over-driving the uncompetitive Jordan-Ford during qualifying and has often paid the price. Justin Wilson (24, Minardi) Having funded his formula one debut with Minardi to the tune of \u00a31.2m, he has struggled to make his mark with the cash-strapped privateer and, like Firman, has used the odd wet track to lift the veil on his terrific car control."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
