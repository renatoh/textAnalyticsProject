My life doesn't usually include too many balls, what with the chickens and the children, and I am unsure what to wear. Does one still wear those great meringue thingies? My husband thinks you can get away with a little black dress but what does he know? I don't want to buy something hideously expensive, but could investigate hiring, if only I knew what sort of thing to look for. I wouldn't mind spending \u00a3100-\u00a3150 to buy something new so long as I could wear it. Any suggestions? Caroline, Guernsey First, apologies for my absence over the past two weeks, but a woman with five children needs to do her Christmas shopping early. Now then, Caroline: I don't see any point in hiring an evening dress. It made sense years ago when evening dresses were much more expensive but now, for the price of hiring last season's dress (especially when so many hire companies force you to pay for three days' hire), you can buy this season's dress and you don't have to worry about ripping it. Yes, I know not everyone will agree with me, but this is my column and that's what I think. You absolutely don't need to wear a meringue dress - your husband is perfectly correct! - although there may be a fair number of them there. The nice thing about balls these days is that the dress code is much more relaxed: you can wear separates, you can wear trousers, but really, I think the chance to wear a very glamorous dress should not be passed over. Big-skirted dresses are actually terribly fashionable as long as the silhouette is perfectly simple, ie, no swags or bows. My favourite place for such things at the moment is Designers for Debenhams (020 7408 4444). I recently took my friend Patricia there and convinced her to buy a Maria Grachvogel long devor\u00e9 dress for \u00a3140. It is spectacular. You can also find designs by Jasper Conran, Pearce II Fionda (fabulous high-necked, backless navy ballgown, \u00a3180), Ben de Lisi, Edina Ronay. My only complaint is that although sizes go up to 18, from 8, there weren't many over a 12, or under a 10 on display, which is crap. Debenhams: sort it out! Your nearest store is in Southampton, Caroline, but you can also buy certain styles online at www.debenhams.com. Otherwise, Monsoon; (mail order: 020 7313 4018) has some wonderful separates - sequin skirts, \u00a3125; sequin ruffle-neck cardigans, \u00a3120; velvet fishtail dresses, \u00a3125. Sizes 10 -16 (newsflash, as of spring, all Monsoon clothes will come in 8-18)! Other favourites are H&amp;M (020 7323 2211), which does great separates for ridiculously cheap prices, sizes 8 -16; and George at Asda (0500 100055), where you can buy a black tuxedo jacket for \u00a330 (!); sizes 10-20. I want to get a loden coat for my son but am unable to find who stocks them. Can you help? Mr Bowers, Stafford Yes I can. There is a fabulous, fabulous new catalogue called Manufactum (0800 096 0937; www.manufactum.co.uk; be warned, however, it takes weeks for delivery). It sells a double-face loden coat for men, 38-46in chest, \u00a3378. For those that don't know, loden is a woollen cloth that is very dense, and therefore very warm; the fibres are overlapped to make the garment wind-and water-resistant but the overall feel is soft and flowy. It used to be worn by farmers and outdoor workers and is a fabric we'd all do well to rediscover. This year's winter boots are all too high, as I march to school then march to work and it's just not possible in heels. What I'd like is a riding boot design, flattish, and to the knee, preferably in black with a brown/red band at the top. I think Russell &amp; Bromley did them a couple of years ago. I know I should have got them at the time but I was up to my eyeballs in toddlers, and boots were way down my list of priorities. Any ideas? Kathryn Riggs, Loughborough It's always the way, isn't it? When you don't want something it's everywhere, the moment you decide you want it it's gone. Let that be a lesson to us all. Russell &amp; Bromley (020 8460 1122; www.russellandbromley.co.uk) did those two-colour boots for years but stopped just recently, due, apparently, to lack of demand. Nowadays they sell an all-black or all-chestnut riding boot, \u00a3245, sizes 3-7. Audley (020 7491 3487) does a dark brown riding boot with a lighter brown band at the top (\u00a3195, sizes 2-9) and also does a made-to-order service, so you can change the colour of the boot (or the fabric) for an extra \u00a375. If you have the money I'd advise you to buy the R&amp;B ones. You'll get more wear out of an all-black or all browny-chestnut pair and you might tire of the two-colour version.
