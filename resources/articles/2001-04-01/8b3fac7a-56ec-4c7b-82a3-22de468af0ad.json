The bank has already extended the loan repayment break offered to farmers at the start of the outbreak to a wide variety of businesses, ranging from chip shops to hotels in affected areas. The bank, which has some 20,000 farming customers, is now expected to announce measures which offer longer-term support for communities, which may involve donations to local charities, for instance. While the initial concerns about the financial impact of the foot and mouth crisis focused on farmers, as the spread of the disease has widened financial experts have become increasingly concerned about other rural businesses, especially those which rely on tourism. Barclays is now thought to be considering longer term help for rural communities in general. Under the terms of its loan repayment freeze already announced, Barclays is allowing farmers and other affected businesses to forgo repayments of the capital for three months but the interest is being deferred to the end of the period. Royal Bank of Scotland is also taking a sympathetic stance towards the farming community and has donated \u00a31m to charities helping farmers.
