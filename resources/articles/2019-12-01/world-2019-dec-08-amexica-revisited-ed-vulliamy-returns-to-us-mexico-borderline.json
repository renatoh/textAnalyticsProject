It\u2019s not a reference to the quality of drinking water (about which polemic abounds because it is so dirty) but to the beguiling lure of this dusty and dangerous yet strong and charismatic city. It\u2019s a dictum that might be applied to the whole 2,000-mile Mexico-US borderland of which Ju\u00e1rez and its sister city on the US side, El Paso, form the fulcrum. Ten years ago, I returned from several months\u2019 immersion along that frontier, reporting on a narco-cartel war for this newspaper and eventually writing a book, Amexica, about the terrain astride the border, land that has a single identity \u2013 that belongs to both countries and yet to neither. A frontier at once porous and harsh: across which communities live and a million people traverse every day, legally, as do hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of goods annually. In the past 10 years I\u2019ve returned scores of times and even lived there for a while, but now the border crisis is so urgent \u2013 with regard to narco-traffic and migration \u2013 that I felt I needed to go back and revisit voices and themes, try to measure what has changed and what has not since I wrote the book. Amexica + 10, if you like. This is now a frontier on which US president Donald Trump fixates, pledging a wall to run its length as a rampart against an \u201cinvasion\u201d. Thousands die or disappear trying to cross it, desperate migrants gather on its southern side, with dreams and illusions of America, only to be incarcerated, separated from family and deported when they get there. What were lonely desert byways 10 years ago now host traffic jams of reporters and TV crews, as the border becomes a place of humanitarian disaster, main mast of Trump\u2019s re-election campaign. Back then, you had to explain who and what Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n and his Sinaloa cartel were. Since that time, we\u2019ve had TV series Narcos ad nauseam, the films Sicario 1 and 2, some wonderful journalism and El Chapo\u2019s trial-as-theatre in New York. Ten years ago, the story along the borderline was narco-traffic, to which the theme of migration played an accompanying role, as the cartels moved in on human trafficking. Now the world is on the move, and much of it has converged on \u201cAmexica\u201d. While 10 years ago, most migrants at the border were in flight from violence and poverty in Mexico, now thousands flee gangland violence in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras; in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, a \u201clittle Havana\u201d of waiting Cubans is established; they come from eastern Europe and Asia; Haitians arrive in Tijuana; migrants gather in Ciudad Acu\u00f1a from the Great Lakes and Horn of Africa. A decade ago, the administration of Barack Obama began a clampdown on criminal immigrants, and accelerated deportations to record levels. Now, Trump has shocked his own country, collided with federal courts and outraged the world with policies separating children from parents, appalling conditions of incarceration, wholesale roundups of immigrants without papers \u2013 or criminal records \u2013 and the sending back ofasylum seekers to \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d (rather than wait for their initial hearings in the country where asylum has been claimed as per international law). But drug violence, cartels and their conviviality with government are perennial and ubiquitous. Amexica was published after the government of Felipe Calder\u00f3n declared war on the cartels in late 2006, after which murder rates hit the highest since the Mexican revolution, and Ju\u00e1rez was the most dangerous city in the world. Homicides then waned, only to spike again now: last year was the bloodiest yet in Mexico, and 2019 is set to overtake it, with the government last week counting 29,574 reported homicides to the end of October. Ten years ago, the task was to report how Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s Sinaloa cartel supplanted rivals along the border west of Ju\u00e1rez, for export mainly of cocaine; then downriver, less successfully, confronting the Zetas and Gulf cartels in Coahuila and Tamaulipas. Now, with Guzm\u00e1n jailed and his cartel fragmented, the plaza \u2013 the drug traffic turf \u2013 is unquiet again, as the C\u00e1rtel Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n stakes its claim, trafficking mainly in synthetic drugs and fentanyl to fill a vacuum left by the clawback on prescribed opioids in the US. Violence increases when the plates shift, and while it used to be worst along the border, now \u2013 though Tijuana is Mexico\u2019s, and the world\u2019s, murder capital \u2013 killing is across the country, through Jalisco, Colima, Guerrero and Veracruz in particular. What happens along this frontier is a prism through which to examine a world where the illicit economy bleeds into the supposedly legal one, to render the border between them a sieve like the physical border itself, as high street banks launder profits of drug traffic with impunity. Amexica ended with the story of the Wachovia bank moving $378bn from Mexico, much of it from the Sinaloa cartel, without adequate checks. HSBC, too, was caught moving El Chapo\u2019s money. No one from either bank has been arrested, let alone jailed. Following Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s conviction, US government forfeiture of his alleged $14bn value is all \u201cback in Mexico\u201d \u2013 money sent to be laundered south of the border \u2013 the small change; none of the hundreds of billions sent into the \u201clegal\u201d economy by Wachovia or HSBC are in their sights. I call it the lie of legality. And so, in what is supposed to be peacetime, a new kind of 21st-century war rages across this enthralling country. The official number of homicides in Mexico since 2007 \u2013 307,624, excluding the disappeared, until October this year \u2013 stands at a level akin to that in some of the worst wars in recent history, yet effervescent Ju\u00e1rez is not like, say, besieged Sarajevo. Part of my book\u2019s aim was to describe unspeakable violence in places where life goes on and daily encounters were generally a delight. This does not change: in no place I know are the ready smile, the unnecessary chat, the twinkle-in-the-eye so pervasive. Uber works fine, people go to mass and to market, shopping centres open, burritos and pastries are delicious, restaurants full again. \u201cIt looks normal,\u201d says Juli\u00e1n Cardona, who took the photographs in Ju\u00e1rez for this article, \u201cbut it\u2019s not.\u201d Cardona has coined the term \u201curban Frankenstein\u201d to describe his adoptive city. Last January, the bodies of a family running a grocery in Ju\u00e1rez were discovered only after stray dogs found and started eating them. In Tijuana, I reported on the abduction and murder of two Honduran migrant boys \u2013 Jasson Ricardo Acu\u00f1a and Jorge Alexander Ru\u00edz \u2013 and the testimony of a third, who survived and led police to the scene. Jos\u00e9 Alberto \u00c1lavarez, Tijuana\u2019s district attorney, showed me photographs of the victims, aged 16 and 17: \u201cI fear to note that one of the deceased was dressed in women\u2019s clothes,\u201d he says, showing a lifeless body, bloodied and strangled, wearing a brassiere and red skirt. \u201cNot only that, but when the survivor took us to the house, one of the killers was still wearing the clothes and shoes of the deceased. Two days later. That\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez First stirrings precede first light in the Chihuahua desert, beyond the frayed edges of Ju\u00e1rez. Mumbling, moaning, crashing of pans heating coffee and the odd scream, at Visi\u00f3n En Acci\u00f3n rehabilitation centre, or \u201crescue asylum\u201d. As the sun\u2019s fiery rays break over the scrub, residents emerge from their sleeping quarters around a courtyard, deranged but dutifully carrying soiled blankets to be bleached in the heat. Rafael heaves his pungent load, saying first that he was a missionary from Veracruz, but then again, he was a dealer from Ju\u00e1rez; actually, he\u2019s a millionaire from Zacatecas \u2013 he\u2019s not sure. This sanctuary for the abandoned mentally ill and other vulnerable people has been run for 24 years by pastor Jos\u00e9 Antonio Galv\u00e1n, who joked 10 years ago that the city out there \u2013 full of yonkes, junkyards of cars totalled in America, refitted for the road \u2013 was actually a \u201chuman junkyard\u201d, while this was \u201ca haven of peace\u201d. Which it is, in a way: where recovering addicts, penitent cartel sicarios (hitmen) and their mistresses, psychos, street dealers and those discarded by the city\u2019s assembly plant economy are refitted for life. Last time I was here, I spent a few nights sharing quarters with a man called Josu\u00e9, who told me he had been \u201cdead when I got here\u201d, from street-gang life in Los Angeles and heroin in Ju\u00e1rez. Today, all that remains of him here is his degree certificate, framed on the pastor\u2019s wall \u2013 Josu\u00e9 is now a practising nurse. Galv\u00e1n still looks like the teddy boy he once was \u2013 in a purple paisley jacket that seems, and doesn\u2019t seem, out of place here \u2013 and greets me with the poised fists of the boxer he also was. \u201cThe Lord is on my side,\u201d he says, punching the air. I feel 10 years older, I tell him, yet he seems younger. \u201cHave passion, have faith, have life,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThese are my people, under my wing. I feel part of this desert now, like a lizard \u2013 you\u2019ve got to look carefully, know what you\u2019re doing and move fast.\u201d Threats from cartels and gangs seeking out patients to enact vengeance have eased, he reports, but \u201cthey never go away\u201d. An estimated 40,000 people have disappeared since 2006 in Mexico \u2013 one of the most outrageous aspects of this war \u2013 and some are found by Peludo, the centre\u2019s pet dog. \u201cHe keeps finding legs, then a head, different bodies in different places, of people who have been kidnapped and disappeared in the desert,\u201d says Galv\u00e1n. \u201cSometimes when it rains, bodies surface, and come floating.\u201d In the yard, \u201chis people\u201d greet Galv\u00e1n, hugging his waist while he pats their matted hair, strokes their scars, each precious to him. Things change, and they don\u2019t. Becky, former pole dancer and crackhead, is dead now, as is big Oscar, former sicario for the Barrio Azteca gang, street affiliate of the old Ju\u00e1rez cartel. But Yogi is still here, shaven-headed 10 years ago, now sporting a jester\u2019s hat. He has Down\u2019s syndrome and schizophrenia. There\u2019s been impressive building work in recent years; what were timeworn breeze-blocks are now whitewashed walls; there\u2019s air conditioning, even a TV area for telenovelas and baseball. Across the patio, the mazed eyes, mind-sickness, and poignant affection between Galv\u00e1n and what he calls \u201cmy family\u201d, echo down 10 years on different faces. The drugs, too, are different, says Galv\u00e1n \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re seeing less crack, more crystal meth, and synthetics\u201d \u2013 but their ravages are the same. The shelter\u2019s nurse, Imelda Castro, explains that it takes \u201ca balance between miracles and medication\u201d. The place is staffed, as it always has been, by former patients, and Galv\u00e1n feels that the story of his last decade can best be told through their example; they are disarmingly open about where they\u2019ve come from. When Vera, the accountant at the centre, arrived four years ago, she was \u201ccompletely wild\u201d, says Galv\u00e1n. Born to a middle-class family in Guanajuato, Vera had \u201centered a life of prostitution and pole dancing \u2013 pregnant at 15,\u201d she says. \u201cI attracted bad people: narcos, sicarios, jefes\u2026\u201d Before long, she was one of them, selling and moving drugs for the Knights Templar cartel. \u201cI saw everything: murder, kidnappings. So much violence, so many drugs, so much sex, you don\u2019t see it for what it is. I admired the power of these people, and respected their authority.\u201d But such proximity was also dangerous, as the Knights were overrun by the Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n: \u201cThey kill women because they have so much information; the favoured women know everything.\u201d After a disastrous relationship, Vera attempted suicide, but was rescued by her parents and placed in a psychiatric hospital. Her parents sold their house to pay for treatment at a shelter and finally Vera arrived at Visi\u00f3n En Acci\u00f3n. \u201cVera has a keen sense for things,\u201d Galvan comments, \u201cand [while helping in the office] she spotted something wrong with the cheques. She suspected a man called Beto, who was my right-hand man. She was right \u2013 Beto was stealing from us. He quit and I gave Vera the job. \u201cYou see,\u201d he adds, \u201cmy job is to find the treasure in people they don\u2019t even know is there themselves.\u201d That must have been difficult in the case of Neor (not his real name), host for my overnight stay. He had had a \u201cbad life\u201d with his father \u201ctaking drugs, whipping us all \u2013 no money, no food\u201d. Neor started on crystal, crack and solvents at the age of 12, then started \u201crobbing and killing for money\u201d, and inevitably did so for a major cartel. \u201cI was a sicario,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve killed the first time, it gets easy \u2013 I was taking so much crystal, I could handle it.\u201d Then one day the time came for him to kill a man who had been given the task of selling a large amount of meth, but had kept and spent the money. \u201cIt was a big hit. For some reason I didn\u2019t want to do it, but they said if I didn\u2019t, they\u2019d kill me.\u201d After a shootout at his house \u2013 \u201cI took a bullet in the leg\u201d, Neor shows me the scar \u2013 he escaped and went on the run. He had heard about a former drug dealer now working at Visi\u00f3n En Acci\u00f3n, and was brought here. How long ago? He beams: \u201cFour months ago.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m strict,\u201d says Galv\u00e1n, \u201cafraid of nothing.\u201d One recent morning, though, Neor found himself out on the highway, planning to return to Guanajuato. \u201cI started shaking,\u201d he says, \u201cand a voice in me said: \u2018Don\u2019t. Go back to work\u2019.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a devil waiting to lure them back any time,\u201d says Galv\u00e1n, \u201cand I gotta beat that devil up.\u201d I had for a moment forgotten that the pastor himself was once an addict on the street. \u201cI learned that,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen I was living among the trash cans \u2013 when I was one of them.\u201d Tijuana On a rainy September morning in Tijuana, at the border\u2019s western edge, an ostentatious but imposing ceremony was arranged: an incineraci\u00f3n de droga by combined law enforcement agencies, where they set fire to 26,000 kilos of heroin, cocaine, crystal meth and other drugs. A torch is applied, flame spreads across the hillock of drugs, black smoke billows skywards \u2013 and a platoon of agents from the Agencia de Investigaci\u00f3n Criminal line up for a team photo against the backdrop of the inferno. It\u2019s been a while since this was done publicly here, but everyone knows it won\u2019t be the last time, and that \u2013 gallant though the choreography is \u2013 this pyre represents but a grain among millions, on the move, out there. My journey through Amexica 10 years ago began and ended here when Tijuana was second only to Ju\u00e1rez in its murder rate. Last year, a report by the Citizens\u2019 Council for Public Security and Criminal Justice, which measures homicides per capita, found six of the world\u2019s 10 most murderous cities to be in Mexico, and Tijuana top of the list. The epilogue to my book was an interview with Antonio Ir\u00e1n \u201cHiram\u201d Mu\u00f1oz, whose macabre expertise at the prosecutor\u2019s office was to analyse the mutilations of cartel victims to decode any messages they might contain \u2013 he called it \u201cnecropsia\u201d rather than \u201cautopsia\u201d: severed feet or toes if someone walked from a cartel, the sliced tongue of a snitch. A forensic expert, but also a philosopher, Mu\u00f1oz was furious at how few prosecutions resulted from his work. We meet now at the Ateneo de Ciencias Universitarias y Artes. Mu\u00f1oz himself founded this college \u201cto train young people to blend the \u2018criminalistic\u2019 \u2013 what is found at a crime scene, scientifically \u2013 and the \u2018criminological\u2019, which is psychological, why the criminal did what he did\u201d, he says. \u201cTen years ago, we talked about terrible things happening in this city. But I was failing to change things at the prosecutor\u2019s office, so decided to create my own university and impart what I knew to the next generation. \u201c[Back then] mutilations were a controlled way of communicating messages. That still happens in the south, but no longer here. In Tijuana now, they just shoot each other on street corners like dogs. Now you just find bodies \u2013 usually killed in one place, and dumped in another.\u201d Before, he posits, \u201cthe narco only killed who he needed to kill. Now, anyone can be a narco \u2013 and they kill anyone.\u201d This change has come about because Mexico\u2019s domestic drug market \u2013 the so-called narcomenudeo \u2013 has increased further since Amexica and is now believed to account for even more violence than that caused by competition for \u201cexport\u201d plazas. \u201cThe drugs don\u2019t just fly to the north,\u201d says Mu\u00f1oz, \u201cthey also stay here, so that now there\u2019s a war for the streets here \u2013 and this contributes to the general collapse. There is no message to send now: I just erase you from the point of sale. Kill one, and I have four more waiting to replace you.\u201d Mu\u00f1oz notes the arrival of fentanyl on the domestic and export markets: \u201cIt\u2019s cheap to make and easy to smuggle. I also come across it in my forensic investigations \u2013 more deaths from fentanyl, often mixed with cocaine, without the addict knowing. Dealers cut other drugs with fentanyl to make them even more addictive. \u201cHuman beings are addicts, addicts of pleasure and power \u2013 coffee, alcohol, sex, extreme sports \u2013 and drugs are the most addictive of all. It\u2019s never going to go away, and what makes this war pure stupidity is that we are never going to win it unless we see the addict as a sick person, not a criminal.\u201d Brownsville/Matamoros, Rio Grande valley The road bends, along stretches of new fence, to the river\u2019s end, where the twin towns of Brownsville and Matamoros, one of six bi-national metropolitan border areas, face one another. A decade ago, Michael Seifert had recently left the priesthood at his parish of San Felipe de Jes\u00fas in Cameron Park, Brownsville, fallen in love with a paediatrician and married her. But he continued to work for the community in a post-pastoral role, until this poorest, entirely Hispanic, quarter of town became the last to be \u201cincorporated\u201d, with running water and electricity in almost every home. Still devout, but a radical theologian, Seifert posited 10 years ago that the Virgin of Guadalupe portrays a dancing Madonna, pregnant with the mestizo Mexican race \u2013 mixed because it was the product of rape by Spanish conquistadors. We meet again: \u201cI had Mexican seminarians walk out on me for that,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cShe\u2019s supposed to be immaculate.\u201d Seifert remains \u201cplugged in to Cameron Park, all the better to keep people connected\u201d, but has adapted his work to the migration crisis, for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), with an \u201cintegrated advocacy\u201d team guiding migrants as they cross from Matamoros into Brownsville in the US, and writing regular internet reports entitled Views from Alongside a Border. \u201cThese people came here,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause they wanted to be safe. Yet over in Matamoros, they are prey to deadly criminals, and here they are met with a system carefully designed to fail them. They can have no idea of the evil genius of our immigration and asylum apparatus, satanic in its cleverness in keeping them out, and in danger.\u201d In January 2019, despite an outcry over child separation, the Trump administration introduced \u201cMigrant Protection Protocols\u201d, whereby asylum seekers, rather than wait for their \u201ccredible fear\u201d interview in the US (as per the 1939 Montevideo treaty on political asylum), are sent back to wait in Mexico. The Mexican government of leftwing president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has given full support, earning compliments from Trump for \u201cspectacular\u201d results: some 58,000 asylum seekers are now reported returned to, and waiting in, Mexico. Immigration courts on the US side are perfunctory and dysfunctional. I was forbidden entry to the huge tent \u2013 or \u201csoft-sided facility\u201d as the government calls it \u2013 erected on the Brownsville side of the river to hear pleas by video link. But I did visit two courts dealing with detained migrants at nearby McAllen and Port Isabel: rows of shackled, confused, weary people hustled through production-line \u201cjustice\u201d, with, in some cases, no more exchange with the bench than a nod to indicate understanding of their \u201crights\u201d, before deportation. Beside the Gateway bridge connecting Matamoros to downtown Brownsville, across a few yards of river and reed bank, is a tent city of around 1,000 people, encamped for safety in numbers, mostly \u201cwaiting in Mexico\u201d for the date on their crumpled but clasped Notice to Appear given to them before they were sent back under Trump\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy. A higher proportion are returned to Matamoros than anywhere else on the border, for all the dangers. My book Amexica ended with the story of the massacre of 72 migrants at San Fernando, Tamaulipas, in 2010. Migrant massacres and disappearances have become increasingly common. On Christmas Eve 2011, 15 migrants were dragged from a diocesan shelter in Matamoros, and never seen again; scores of disappearances have followed. Staff at the bus station have witnessed, on many occasions, the macabre arrival of baggage belonging to migrants on board coaches from the interior, with no one to claim them. In Nuevo Laredo last month, Aar\u00f3n M\u00e9ndez, manager of a Presbyterian shelter, was abducted after refusing to hand over those in his care to a unit of gunmen. Seifert had put me in touch with his opposite number on the Matamoros side of the border, the kind of person these situations throw up, hurricane heroines and heroes of the hour. Glady Ca\u00f1as Aguilar is in her \u201coffice\u201d in a small row of shops. A crowd awaits her; everyone wants a piece of her \u2013 a moment with her. About 80% of migrants, she says, come from Honduras, fleeing gang violence \u2013 also from El Salvador, Guatemala, Cuba, and some from Africa. \u201cPeople often stay for months,\u201d she says, crossing in groups of 15 according to a system operated by the border patrol known as \u201cmetering\u201d, which limits the number of people who may apply, creating numbered waiting lists on the Mexican side. \u201cMore than 250 tents and we cope,\u201d she says, \u201cjust about, but they\u2019ve been here too long and it\u2019s all too much \u2013 chicken pox, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and waiting, waiting\u2026 Here, they\u2019re safe, but out in the town, absolutely not.\u201d Ca\u00f1as Aguilar blames a \u201cfalta de amor\u201d \u2013 lack of love \u2013 in the world. But she must go now: a group of Tzotzil Mayans has arrived from the Mexican town of San Juan Chamula, evicted by fighting between rival political militias; she takes control of the chaotic scene, distributing sanitary kit and clothes \u2013 including a silver-sequined tunic for a girl called Flora. Back to Ju\u00e1rez In Amexica I quoted the great writer of the borderland Charles Bowden: \u201cIf the Pulitzer [prize] stands for publishing the truth against the might of governments and at risk of your life, then this year the nabobs of American journalism have it easy: give all the newspaper prizes to the people of El Diario.\u201d Ten years ago, Sandra Rodr\u00edguez was mourning the loss of her colleague on Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s daily newspaper, El Diario. Armando Rodr\u00edguez was shot dead in his car as he prepared to take his daughter to school in November 2008. Sandra Rodr\u00edguez took the same risks, wrote the same kind of stories for which her friend died. She was preoccupied by what she called \u201cthe culture of impunity in this city, from its very design, to the way the economy works; from the street to the top\u201d. She published an important book of reportage from the city in 2012, La F\u00e1brica del Crimen (The Crime Factory), which was published in English as The Story of Vicente, Who Murdered His Mother, His Father and His Sister, which he did. Rather than write about capos and sicarios, Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s subject is the brutalisation of Mexican society. Vicente did what he did, he said, \u201cporque puedo\u201d, because I can. Over the past decade, Rodr\u00edguez reflects, \u201cthe story of Mexico is as Vicente predicted: you can do whatever you want, with impunity. You can kill whoever you want, kill in broad daylight, kill a journalist, disappear 43 students \u2013 and get away with it. Vicente has become a metaphor for the whole country.\u201d As news editor, Rodr\u00edguez faces a dilemma. \u201cWe have a picture,\u201d she says, \u201cof two people walking past a corpse, and they don\u2019t even glance at it \u2013 this is Ju\u00e1rez after 10 years. I want it on the front page, but we don\u2019t have a story to go with it. Or we have a 16-year-old killed, without a birth certificate or school record. Again, this should be front-page news. But it\u2019s not: people being killed is no longer news in Ju\u00e1rez, or the rest of Mexico \u2013 killing has become normal and crime has become a habit.\u201d Rodr\u00edguez has since lost another colleague, Miroslava Breach, an investigative journalist from her home town of Chiuhuahua, murdered in 2017 when leaving home, like Armando. Twelve journalists have been killed in Mexico so far this year, so that \u2013 according to a report on US National Public Radio last month, Mexico has overtaken Syria as the most dangerous country in the world for journalists. On the day I crossed from El Paso to Ju\u00e1rez this time, a correspondent from National Geographic was shot and wounded. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous,\u201d says Rodr\u00edguez. \u201cIt comes from the same disease, impunity. They do it because they know they can, to silence the press.\u201d And yet, for all this, when a friend in our company asks: \u201cHave you ever been really happy?\u201d Rodr\u00edguez does not hesitate: \u201cYes, my city makes me happy. I love Ju\u00e1rez; it kills people, but it gives me a sense of life, unconnected to the killings, to do with its complexity, and its people.\u201d Kill it certainly does. The culture of impunity, says Rodr\u00edguez, has its roots in the 90s, \u201cwith the killing of 300 women in this city, when we realised nothing would happen to the killers\u201d. The so-called \u201cFemicidio\u201d brought Ju\u00e1rez to the attention of the world, and me back to the city in 1999. The misogynist \u201cstyle\u201d of killing \u2013 a word used \u201cnot lightly\u201d by anthropologist Cecilia Ball\u00ed in Amexica \u2013 seemed to take the violence to another level. In her thesis, Ball\u00ed explored this \u201csexual murder\u201d in the light of a \u201chypermasculinity in US-Mexico border zones, informed by the history, style and logic of militarisation and organised crime\u201d. Among the mothers who suffered unfathomable grief at the abduction, violation and murder of a daughter was Paula Flores, the body of whose 17-year-old daughter Maria Sagrario Gonz\u00e1lez was found dumped in the desert in April 1998. She had disappeared after leaving home early to take a bus to work in one of Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s hundreds of maquiladora assembly plants, bedrock of the city\u2019s economy. My chapter on the Femicidio opened with Paula imploring the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, which Sagrario wore around her neck: \u201cWhere were you when they did this to my little girl?\u201d Flores\u2019s face has changed remarkably little since I last saw her 10 years ago, or indeed since I first interviewed her in 1999 and again in 2002. It carries that same wounded but indomitable fortitude. She lives in the same house, attached to the family\u2019s grocery store at the top of the Anapra barrio, a quarter called Lomas de Poleo, on the north-western outskirts of town, right against the border. An old, repainted American school bus grinds up the dusty slope, with the mountains behind El Paso as backdrop. \u201cTime passes,\u201d Flores says. \u201cIt\u2019s been 21 years now and everything is the same \u2013 nothing has happened. We are marked for life, and will remain so while there is no reckoning with what happened. There can be no recovery. And it continues: women keep disappearing, keep being murdered.\u201d On the other hand, \u201cI have my store, and my family. At weekends we are all together, all from Durango, though my grandchildren were born here. Eleven of them now, some of the age Maria Sagrario was, and that can be traumatic.\u201d In 2005, a man called Jos\u00e9 Luis Hern\u00e1ndez was jailed for the murder of Maria Sagrario \u2013 sentenced for 28 years. \u201cBut I fear he will be out much sooner,\u201d says Flores. That is not the end of the matter: \u201cHe said he was paid $800 to be part of this. But by whom? Who else was involved, and why? We have always said that everything rests with the authorities, that the authorities were complicit in the murder of women in Ju\u00e1rez. \u201cEvery year, on the anniversary \u2013 16 April \u2013 we get together and repaint the crosses,\u201d says Flores \u2013 they are black on a pink background, painted or placed on walls, lamp-posts and public spaces around the city. In 2012, the mayor of Ju\u00e1rez, Hector Murgu\u00eda, announced he would ban this practice and \u201capply the law\u201d on defacement of public space. \u201cHe threatened us, but we did it,\u201d says Flores, though \u201cthis year only four of us turned up.\u201d The mothers of six murdered women, including Flores, filed a suit \u2013 Silvia Elena Rivera Morales et al vs Mexico \u2013 through the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, over the authorities\u2019 abrogation of responsibility. A hearing was held in Washington DC on 29 September. \u201cThough my daughter\u2019s case is from 21 years ago,\u201d Flores told the commission, \u201cI still feel the same pain of my daughter not being here. She deserves justice.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she says now in her kitchen, \u201cwith the other mothers, we\u2019re still pushing this. It was all very nice there in Washington, and the president of the court offered his sympathies. But they\u2019ve had this case since 2007, and it\u2019s a verdict we need, not sympathy. I don\u2019t think they have any idea of the emotional toll, the pain involved.\u201d Flores seems rightly exhausted with trying to find words for the unspeakable. Two of her other daughters arrive, and there\u2019s a delicious lunch of spicy beans, cheese and tortillas, a portrait of Maria Sagrario staring down from the back wall. There\u2019s discussion of music, grandchildren, climate crisis and life around the barrio. We\u2019re done for today with what Edgar Allan Poe called \u201cthe hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer themselves to be revealed\u201d. But there\u2019s one final question: where was the Virgin of Guadalupe when they did that? \u201cI asked the same question to the cross on her coffin, and the virgin on her locket: why didn\u2019t she protect her?\u201d says Flores, \u201cand I\u2019ve asked it every day since, and I hear no answer. I still believe. But how can it be? Maria Sagrario was not against God; she was a believer, she sang in church, and helped at Sunday school. During Lent that year, I prayed for the protection of my daughters. Three days later, Maria Sagrario disappeared. \u201cI try to ask myself not so much \u2018Why did she die?\u2019 but \u2018For what?\u2019 Maybe for the school. Maybe so that with the help of the other mothers, I can raise awareness about what is happening here. So the world would take notice \u2013 maybe.\u201d A 10th anniversary edition of Amexica by Ed Vulliamy will be published by Vintage books next year.
