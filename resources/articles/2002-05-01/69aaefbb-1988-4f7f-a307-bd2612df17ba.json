Built with \u00a31 million of Forestry Commission funding, the centres are based at Coed-y-Brenin and Betws-y-Coed, in North Wales; Nant-yr-Arian, near Aberystwyth; Afan Argoed, near Port Talbot; and Cwm Carn, near Newport. For further information, visit mbwales.com England Quantock Hills, Somerset, is an unsung area of excellent moorland trails, which rarely get too boggy, even in winter. Fine forest tracks and great views across the Bristol Channel. Access from the M5 is relatively easy, too. Swaledale, Yorkshire, has a network of old mining tracks that criss-cross the open moors providing great, easily navigated riding, and there are some top pubs in the valley. If you like your riding steep and tough, the Lake District is the place to head for, with a wide range of trails up and over the fells. There's also easier, waymarked riding to be had in places such as Grizedale Forest. Scotland The Nevis Range is the only ski-lift accessible biking in Britain. While this takes the hard work out of it all, the downhills will test you quite enough."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
