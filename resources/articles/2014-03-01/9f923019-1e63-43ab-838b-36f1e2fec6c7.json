What is the diagnosis? You don\u2019t need to be a doctor to guess pneumonia, and that the patient requires hospitalisation. You probably need to be a doctor or another clinician to estimate that his expected length of stay hovers around five days. At a rough guess, he will encounter during his stay 25 health professionals ranging from doctors and nurses to pharmacists and physiotherapists. We will restore his health and when he quips \u201cno offence, but I hope we never meet again\u201d, we will humour him. Every year, I admit a handful of such patients to my medicine unit and when they leave, I always ask, \u201cany last questions?\u201d The inquiries are usually simple, along the lines of checking on a medical certificate or wanting a fresh list of medications. Sometimes an overly cautious patient raises a pedantic detail but I happily oblige, teaching my residents that the engaged patient is an empowered patient. But here is the one question that I am fairly confident not one of us can answer: \u201cDoc, how much did my care cost?\u201d I am ashamed to admit that after a decade of working as a physician, I would reply, \u201cYou know, I have no idea.\u201d I could provide a slightly more nuanced answer if I wore my oncologist hat. Annual PBS expenditure on anticancer drugs rose from $65m to $466m in the last decade, so I could safely say, \u201ctreating your pneumonia was cheap compared to treating lung cancer.\u201d I could speculate, \u201cI imagine your admission cost roughly $1,000 a day; however it may have been $2,000 on the day you came close to needing ICU.\u201d But to be honest, my need to get the facts right would mean I\u2019d rather come clean and tell the truth. I simply don\u2019t know. One could argue that costing an entire admission is complicated, so let\u2019s take a small aspect of it. Antibiotic prescribing guidelines have religiously preached the message to select the narrowest spectrum and most cost-effective drug for a given infection, taking into account important patient factors such as severity of illness, allergies and of course, leaving room for clinical discretion. But infectious disease physicians lament at the casual flouting of these guidelines, with patients routinely receiving more broad-spectrum and expensive antibiotics than prudent. So imagine the same patient asking, \u201cdoctor, how much did my antibiotics cost?\u201d Again, I can safely bet that most people, including me would answer, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. To save some dignity, I could venture, \u201cpenicillin is cheap but you had something much more expensive.\u201d Or, \u201cThe tablets are cheaper than the intravenous form.\u201d But again, it would be better to say to the inquiring mind, \u201cI have no idea.\u201d This time, at least I could satisfy our curiosity by checking the PBS website but then, hospitals negotiate bulk-buying prices and even if I knew the price of a vial, I have no idea how much it costs by the time a nurse double or triple checks patient information, prepares the infusion and administers it to the patient, sometimes by staying put at the bedside, which delays her other work. Is the cost doubled, tripled or far less? I think you get my drift. Research from the Grattan Institute points to a billion dollars of annual waste in public healthcare expenditure in Australia. Reasons include disparate purchasing and inefficient staffing, in other words \u201csystems issues\u201d and importantly, issues that are beyond a doctor\u2019s individual remit. I am not a health economist but I frequently find myself wondering what proportion of the billion dollar waste might be explained by differences in individual clinician practice, not just of doctors but also by nurses, pharmacists, allied health and the like. After all, every day substantial healthcare spending is driven by the actions clinicians take at the bedside. What role do our collective decisions to investigate, prescribe, refer, re-refer, operate, rehabilitate or palliate play in contributing to waste? The modern doctor is spoilt for choice. Medicine has wrought many wonders but as many disillusioned patients and their doctors are discovering, there is a limit to how much expensive testing and even more expensive prescribing can overturn the ravages of so-called \u201clifestyle diseases\u201d. However, the runaway cost of healthcare seems all but invincible. Or is it? Is it possible that educating those who are the frontline of healthcare about the true cost of the care they offer could make for a more informed profession and one day, a more informed public? Having worked in the public health system all my life, I cannot recall a single pragmatic and relevant discussion about how a clinician\u2019s actions at the bedside could curb cost. Yes, there are memos reinforcing the need for responsibility but what I want my intern to know is that it costs $75 to order one test and $300 for another and no dollars if we can get by with a good history, which is not uncommon. I want her to appreciate that cholesterol medications cost us as a society a billion dollars so that she thinks twice before reflexively adding it to the chart of a 90 year old man who has suffered a heart attack. I want to practice and teach from an ethical platform that allows me to have crucial conversations with patients about incredibly expensive drugs that have minimal benefit. But to do this successfully, I want to know in plain terms what difference it makes to the behemoth system if I discharge a patient one day earlier, scrutinise his drug chart more thoroughly for redundancies, and streamline my investigations. And while I am not unique in wanting the best for my patients, I would really like to know whether an individual doctor who is conscious of resources makes a net difference to the cost of healthcare. Pondering the doctor\u2019s role in the cost or waste of precious healthcare resources has never been anyone\u2019s favourite job. Doctors bristle at the notion, and administrators shudder. In fact, it has long been considered a matter of principle that doctors do what is best for the individual patient and let someone else worry about the cost. But of course, for every patient that needs our help today, there is a whole community waiting to see us tomorrow; in order to sustain quality and cost-effective healthcare, we must start including \u201ceveryday\u201d doctors in the conversation, something that we have long ignored. We must think imaginatively about how to educate doctors on communicating the deeply sensitive issue of cost to patients at all stages of illness ,but particularly about the meaning and cost of interventions at the end of life. Cost should not, and I don\u2019t imagine ever will be, the principal tool by which to navigate the revered doctor-patient relationship. But instead of pretending the consideration simply does not exist, we should begin by highlighting the association between cost-effective care, its benefit to the individual patient and to society as a whole."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
