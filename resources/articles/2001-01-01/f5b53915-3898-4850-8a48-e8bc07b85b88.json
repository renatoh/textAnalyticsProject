According to Variety, Alcott has signed a six-figure deal to write about the exploits of the world's first female superhero. Although there is no word yet on who will play the lead role, the name of Sandra Bullock, who is hot again after the success of Miss Congeniality (pictured), has been mentioned more than once. \u0095 Bono has hit back at Mel Gibson's claim that Wim Wender's Million Dollar Hotel was \"as boring as a dog's arse\" by claiming that the reason Gibson criticised the project was because he wasn't pleased with the role he had to play. Gibson, who played a freak with an amputated third arm in the whodunit, made the comments on a publicity tour for his latest film What Women Want. Bono told Q Magazine: \"It was a thankless part. He doesn't win, he doesn't get the girl and he doesn't get to kill everybody.\" The U2 singer went on to say that he felt very hurt on Wenders' behalf for Gibson's comments and added: \"Wim has made two, maybe more, of the top 30 films ever made. Has Mel? In the end, is it about box office over being great?\" Gibson's spokesman, lan Neirob, refuted Bono's accusations, calling them \"absurd.\" \u0095 Julia Roberts is to wed long-time boyfriend Benjamin Bratt, according to reports this afternoon, after the Golden Globe-winning actress apparently issued an ultimatum to him to either marry her or break up. Bratt, who will be seen next in Steven Soderbergh's Traffic, apparently chose the former. A \"friend\" of the Erin Brockovich star claimed: \"Julia is eager to start the next phase of her life - not that of movie star, but as wife and mother. She is over the moon and the happiest I've ever seen her.\" \u0095 DJ Paul Oakenfold is to make his acting debut in a new film about the bar and club scene in Brixton, according to ananova. South West Nine, which will follow six characters through 24 hours in the south London suburb, is to be made by Fruit Salad Films, the company behind Human Traffic. Although it is not clear yet which role Oakenfold will play, fellow DJ Lol Hammond has also agreed to a cameo appearance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
