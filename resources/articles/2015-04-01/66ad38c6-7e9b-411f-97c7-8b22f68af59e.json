The former Ireland centre, who retired last year, also claims that more players will move to France after the World Cup. O\u2019Driscoll won three Heineken Cup titles in four years with Leinster but is expecting both Toulon and Clermont Auvergne to advance to the final of the inaugural European Rugby Champions Cup at Twickenham. Clermont play Saracens in Saint-Etienne on Saturday before the second semi-final between Toulon and Leinster on Sunday. The Wasps director of rugby, Dai Young, called for a rethink of the salary cap following his side\u2019s 32-18 defeat to Toulon in the quarter-finals earlier this month, with some concerned that wage restrictions for Premiership clubs will hinder their progress in Europe. O\u2019Driscoll, 36, who expects Clermont to be crowned European champions this season, said that money was a crucial factor in continental competition and that certain academies \u201caren\u2019t able to live\u201d with the wealthy sides. Asked how English clubs could prevent French dominance in Europe, O\u2019Driscoll said: \u201cI think you probably have to offer the guys that are going to France some more money. Because it\u2019s their career and you are going to go where the money is. There is a balance between wanting to go somewhere where you might get success, but you\u2019ve also got to look after your future. \u201cIt [the cap] is a big factor, it\u2019s a big factor because money is going to attract the best players. I\u2019d love to see the breakdown of how many Sanzar [South Africa, New Zealand and Australia] team players after the World Cup come to the UK and Ireland and how many go to France. You\u2019d have to imagine the majority will go to France. \u201cAnd why is that? Not just for the tan. They are looking to make themselves a little pension and enjoy life down there too I suppose. This is a career, it\u2019s no different to any other career. If you\u2019re offered another \u00a3100,000 or \u00a3200,000 playing somewhere else the likelihood is you\u2019re going to take it.\u201d Regarding the Premiership salary cap, he continued: \u201cI don\u2019t know enough about it. I don\u2019t know what it means to certain clubs. Certain clubs are being squeezed so the cap is there to save them. Unless you have a benefactor that comes in and is willing to make a loss, you\u2019re in a bit of a tricky predicament. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be careful what you do. The English utopia is that each club gets a Roman Abramovich and it\u2019s their pet thing so they are able to extend salary caps and attract the better players. That married with the best of the English academy players coming through, of course they\u2019d be competitive again. But it is going to be a money issue, absolutely. The game is going that way.\u201d Saracens scraped past Racing M\u00e9tro in the last eight thanks to a last-gasp penalty from Marcelo Bosch, while Leinster ground out an 18-15 victory against Bath. That win for O\u2019Driscoll\u2019s former side ensured an Irish berth in the European Cup semi-finals for an eighth successive season. However, O\u2019Driscoll believes Clermont are the strongest side left in the competition and that they could be spurred on by previous failures, having never won the Heineken Cup despite coming so close in 2013. \u201cThey are without a shadow of a doubt the best team that have never won the European Cup. They have been to one final, multiple semis now. Teams that tend to continually knock on the door eventually do win it. I\u2019m not a total believer that you have to feel the pain to feel the upside, but I think it helps for driving desire when it really comes to crunch time in the last 10 minutes, how much you really want it and how much you felt the disappointment before and don\u2019t want that feeling again,\u201d said O\u2019Driscoll. \u201cIf you\u2019re judging a potential winner on the back of the quarter-finals it\u2019s hard to look beyond Clermont because of their appetite, you know they are going to want it. They have been nearly, nearly there. They have been in the hunt too many times and have got a better team now. It\u2019s just can they go to the pressurised position of being in a final, with the expectation. They should have won it two years ago and they butchered it. \u201cI think there is a dominance there but it doesn\u2019t mean guaranteed French success. Of the two semi-finals the French teams are absolutely firm favourites but there is the possibility of an upset in both games.\u201d Since 2011 the Rugby Football Union has imposed a policy of not selecting players for England if they play abroad, to stem a potential exodus of talent to the Top 14. Toulon\u2019s Steffon Armitage and Clermont\u2019s Nick Abendanon have been in good form this season, and it remains to be seen if the RFU will utilise the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d clause in their rules to call up both players before the World Cup in September. Asked if it made sense to call up the French-based players, O\u2019Driscoll said: \u201cFrom a player point of view, yes it would. But if you set out your stall early and have to backtrack a little bit, do you lose a little bit of face by doing that? You create your own stick that you have to beat yourself with in many ways. Personally, I think you play your best players.\u201d Brian O\u2019Driscoll is an ambassador and rugby expert for BT Sport.
