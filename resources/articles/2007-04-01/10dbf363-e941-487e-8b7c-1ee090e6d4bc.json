My diary has for the year a brief 'general elec' on Thursday, then nothing until Sunday, when there is the equally terse 'cricket'. I remember the game quite well because half my team were still drunk from celebrating the Labour victory three days earlier. This past week, I've noticed a similar elation in the air; the end is near and I dare say even tenacious Mr Blair feels a little spring in his step. Ten years ago... how much has altered since in the way we live. The changes of this decade seem to me to have been greater than those in any other period in my life. They include, in no particular order: climate change - tangible and sweaty, with humid winters and scorching summers; the rise of Islamic terrorism; the collapse of the Church of England to the point where disestablishment seems imminent after a solid half-millennium; a transformation in the way we communicate and inform ourselves, via the internet, email and mobile phones, so that people who, in 1997, never dreamt of using 'computers' now spend at least an hour a day on screen; the way that our speeding journeys and our shopping and our doing nothing are recorded by hidden cameras; a new conviction that we have no right to pass judgment on anyone else's behaviour (with two interesting exceptions: paedophilia and racism, where it's still acceptable to have a view); the huge multiplication of television channels and the related rise of freak-show programmes ('Celebrity Big Incest Island'); an unprecedented number of immigrants, resulting in foreign-language road signs; and - though I accept that this is a London-only phenomenon - the transformation of the bicyclist from friendly dogooder into scary criminal. These changes have one rather odd thing in common: they are almost nothing to do with Tony Blair or his many governments and cabinets or any of the huge number of laws they have passed. Mr Blair's curious decision to invade Iraq has not made us popular with Muslim fundamentalists, it's true, but the world changed before then. Tony Blair might have made the problem worse for us, but he didn't cause it. On immigration, the government, like most of us, seems a bit muddled, not wishing to seem inhospitable, but slightly dismayed at the scale. Its statutory measures and countermeasures have had little impact. In 1997, 'global warming', as we called it then, was not accepted as a reality; there were still very many people who believed the major problem we faced was a new ice age. The government has lately started to make green noises, but naturally has no power over the ozone layer or ice floes. You could argue, as Henry Porter does in this newspaper, that the spy cameras around us are part of a political programme, but I think even Mr Porter would admit that we still have to reserve judgment on whether his worst fears will be realised. This is not to deny that Mr Blair has tried hard to do good things in Africa and Ulster, it's just that the results have little impact on life for most of us. I hope that the legacy-hunting Prime Minister will therefore allow himself a moment of modesty when he leaves the keys to Number 10 on the hall table. His influence on us has sometimes been marginal, but more often it has been peripheral - or nil. Journalists are calling it the Blair Decade, but it wasn't really. It was the decade of Islam and IT. Mr Blair has left hardly a fingerprint on the years and, in a liberal democracy, that is perhaps how it should be. Most people's lives have a steady mixture of the social and the solitary, in factory or field, office or school. The life of the novelist has no such balance. For three years, you're alone with your thoughts, then for three weeks you're thrown to the microphones in the name of 'publicity'. The modern writer's life is like a cross between that of the Venerable Bede and Naomi Campbell. My new novel, Engleby, is published on Thursday, so I am entering the Campbell phase. At a talk last Monday, I fielded questions about 'what gave you the idea for', etc. I was reminded how hard most readers find it to grasp the concept of fiction. They assume that everything in a novel is based on your personal experience, lightly, or not at all, rewritten. When I toured the country doing readings after Birdsong, most people could not conceal their disappointment. They had expected me to be 105 years old, French and, in some weird way, female. One man asked me how I knew what is was like to fight at the Somme. I told him I'd read a lot of documents, visited the site, then made it up. 'You made it up?!' he spat at me. Yes, I said, that's my job. But he didn't believe me and neither did anyone else there. They thought I'd found a pile of old papers in the attic and passed them off as mine. I recounted this to my audience last Monday and concluded: 'So now I just admit that yes, I am really a 110-year-old French woman, that I was parachuted into France for SOE in 1942, was an alcoholic diplomat in Washington in 1960 and wrote Human Traces only because my great aunt was in a lunatic asylum in 1895.' Sympathetic laughter all round, but as I was leaving, a woman stopped me, all concern, and asked: 'Which asylum was your aunt in?' I now officially give up. Mike Engleby, loner, drug-user, scientist - c'est moi. A working lunch on Thursday to discuss what authors we will do for the next series of The Write Stuff, Radio 4's 'game of literary correctness'. These lunches usually end in a stand-off between me and John Walsh, my opposite number and old friend, who tries to bulldoze various Irish authors past me (score after one round of Samuel Beckett in 2003: JW: 24; SF: 0), while I try and slip some French writers past him. So far, no luck. Thanks to the peacekeeping skills of James Walton, the chairman, and Katie Marsden, the producer, we have settled on Ted Hughes and John Grisham for a live recording at the Hay festival on 28 May. I foresee some courtroom swatting. We all have a view on language and words, the use of, misuse of, change of, etc. Although I would love never to read the word 'iconic' again, I am quite laissez-faire about all this. My interest is in the astonishing speed of change. For several hundred years, the past tense, or preterite, of 'bring' was 'brought'. In roughly three years, it has changed to 'bought'. Everyone I know, except my wife, now says: 'I was bought up in X' or: 'I bought it with me.' The rapidity of the switch is remarkable. In 2010, will the preterite of 'think' no longer be 'thought', but 'taught' - as in 'I taught as much'? Such a change would be no quicker than that of 'brought' to 'bought' and no less odd.
