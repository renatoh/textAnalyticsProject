TSN, which provides personal and professional advice to teachers, dealt with 28,000 separate cases last year - nearly 8,000 more than the year before - their annual report revealed today. And, more than ever, teachers' approaches focus on problems experienced in the classroom. Of the 28,000 requests for support received via TSN's helpline and online counselling service, 22% came from teachers feeling depressed about their jobs and another 23% were from teachers experiencing \"conflict at work\". Conflicts include those between classroom teachers and managers, teaching assistants, colleagues and pupils' parents. On classroom conflicts, the report says: \"Callers report that they experience dread every time they see the other party and will go to great lengths to avoid any contact. \"If conflict is being experienced with a manager, callers often talk of giving an unconditional yes to any tasks they are asked to assume because they are frightened of raising their concerns.\" It continued: \"Common scenarios occur where the manager makes a continuous stream of requests of the teacher who agrees to everything. To external observers, nothing looks unusual. But in reality the relationship has no communication, and is simply requests and affirmative responses.\" Patrick Nash, TSN's chief executive, said: \"There are particularly strong currents sweeping through teaching in terms of change and we tend to get a lot of calls because people aren't sure what the implications are. \"The workforce agreement is an area of anxiety - the average teacher is really concerned about what it means in their lives and in their classroom. Our job is to help them understand.\" The working relationship and breakdown of responsibilities between teachers and teaching assistants was another prominent issue, said Mr Nash. He added that internet approaches accounted for some of the overall increase in cases. Of the roughly 10,000 calls about workplace issues, 9% concerned problems with pupil behaviour and aggression in the classroom. These reflect growing concerns following the publication of a 150-page report, commissioned by the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers in October, which concluded that serious classroom violence is on the rise - but that the greatest danger to the fabric of school communities and teacher retention is the pernicious low-level disruption that staff face every day. Around 10% of the calls came from ethnic minority teachers with most of those, a total of 380, being from Indian teachers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
