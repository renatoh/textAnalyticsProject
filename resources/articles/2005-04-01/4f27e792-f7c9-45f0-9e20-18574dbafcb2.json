The approaches, revealed by the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce and Industry, are the first signal that the Chinese are determined to press ahead with plans to begin production overseas just as output ceases in Britain. The moves came as eight European subsidiaries of Rover, in places such as Germany and Spain, were put under the same administrators as the main part of the business. The companies, employing 300 people, provide sales and distribution centres for Rover, which has been selling around 6,000 cars a year in each of its biggest continental markets, France and Germany. Meanwhile John Towers, the former boss of MG Rover, insisted there was still a \"slim hope\" that there could be a deal with China to restart Longbridge production. Jerry Blacket, policy director at the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce and Industry, confirmed that local suppliers had been approached by SAIC but said there was still an issue over who owns the tooling of the 75. \"We wish it was different circumstances, but the fact that first-tier suppliers may be able to sell to SAIC offers some glimmer of hope to those companies hard hit by the MG Rover demise,\" he said. Mr Towers said his fellow directors were paid \u00a330,000 a year when MG Rover was first bought but this figure had only risen to \u00a336,000 by 2005. The \"widely exaggerated\" earnings were paid by Rover's owners, Phoenix Venture Holdings, as a result of activities that had nothing to do with Rover. Gemma Cartwright, the wife of one of his former workers who earlier led an army of women and children to Downing Street to protest the closure of Longbridge, blamed Mr Towers for the \"long, painful and slow death\" of the company. Mrs Cartwright, 28, now involved in a task force to help people hit by the Rover crisis, asked him: \"Do you feel that you have worked your employees to the ground and was it your intention to close Rover in five years? You got rid of jobs for life, did this help you in any way?\" Mr Towers, one of the Phoenix Four that bought the car company off BMW in 2000 for a token sum, replied: \"This wasn't our intention. We bought a business that was losing \u00a3800m, people gave us 14 months, that's all. That business had a dowry from BMW of \u00a3400m, how do you think we kept that business going for five years if all we were bothered about was taking away job for life contracts and closing it down.\" But the mother-of-four said the workforce had done everything asked of them but there was nothing to show for it. One Rover worker asked Mr Towers how he could \"square his pay with the employees walking away with a few thousand at most\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
