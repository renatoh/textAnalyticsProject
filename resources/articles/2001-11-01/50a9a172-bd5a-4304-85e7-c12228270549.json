Their recent spell of good results was interrupted by only their second home defeat of the season and it saw them drop to third in the table. Their performance simply lacked the inspiration to overcome a well-organised and spirited West Bromwich, who moved into seventh spot. Albion came into the game on the back of a dismal run. After a bright start to the season that saw last season's play-off losers once again riding high in the table, their last six outings prior to last night had netted only one win. Part of the problem has been striker after striker sidelined with injury, and then of course there was the \u00a35m sale of Lee Hughes to Coventry. In an attempt to remedy the problem the manager Gary Megson has been forced to dip into the transfer market. An attempt to sign Middlesbrough's Brian Deane recently fell through, but this week he managed to get Uwe R\u00f6sler on loan from Southampton. The German has long been on the fringes of the Saints team and his double miss on 18 minutes can only suggest why. A right-wing cross from Neil Clement was headed back into the area by Albion's other wing-back Des Lyttle at the far post. It found R\u00f6sler free in front of goal but he could only head the ball against the bar before compounding his error by blasting the inviting rebound over from close range. It was the first real chance of a game both sides had begun cagily, each aware of the other's potential potency. Palace lacked the level of urgency one expects from the home side and they created few chances in the first half. Then, on the half-hour, Dougie Freedman suddenly came alive, cleverly twisting and turning past three defenders but then wasting the possibilities of a clear run at goal with a tame shot wide. But Albion were unbowed and went down to the other end and nearly scored. Andy Johnson's great through-ball set the veteran Bob Taylor free on goal but his shot, though hard, nestled comfortably in the arms of the Palace keeper Matt Clarke, who was guarding his near post. Jovan Kirovski and Dean Austin then went close for Palace. But it was a poor half by their recent standards. Albion, compact and enterprising, were proving a hard nut to crack, so it was no surprise to see Palace emerge for the second half with more urgency and twice going close to scoring in the first three minutes. First Kirovski was inches away from turning in Julian Gray's cross at the near post, then Aki Riihilahti's clever ball over the top found Clinton Morrison free six yards out but his snap shot was brilliantly saved by Russell Hoult. Palace were getting their passes forward a lot quicker. But their early spurt soon fizzled out and from nothing Albion took the lead. Hoult's long kick bounced into the Palace area, finding Taylor about 12 yards out. Though guarded by two defenders, the 34-year-old showed that his feet are still nimble by executing a nifty 180 degree turn to elude his markers before coolly poking the ball past Clarke. It was Taylor's 129th goal in 301 games for the Baggies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
