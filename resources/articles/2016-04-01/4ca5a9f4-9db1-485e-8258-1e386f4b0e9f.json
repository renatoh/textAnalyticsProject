Guardiola\u2019s arrival was confirmed on 1 February when City were in second place, three points behind Leicester City. Pellegrini\u2019s side have fallen to fourth, taking seven points from a possible 21, and are 15 behind the leaders with a game in hand. Yet, asked if ensuring his players respond to him was now difficult, Pellegrini said: \u201cI think that as a manager and as a player you must always be motivated. It doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 you never know what will happen at the end of the season. It\u2019s very important for the mentality of the players to always try to be a winner, to try and win as many titles and games as you can. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think anybody is thinking about what will happen next season. Every player must be thinking about what is happening in this moment and to try and finish as a successful season.\u201d Pellegrini also defended his record at City, where he has won the title and two Capital One Cups, including one this term. \u201cI don\u2019t think about my legacy in this club, really. I am thinking to win Bournemouth on Saturday,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you ask me for the moment, I won three titles in less than three years in difficult situations. It\u2019s not easy to come here to the Premier League, coming from away, we are just talking about how hard it is to work in another country. But we won the title \u2013 the Premier \u2013 and the Capital One, we improved a lot of things in the Champions League and when we finish the season we can make a complete analysis.\u201d Pellegrini also insisted there should be optimism regarding Vincent Kompany. The Belgian suffered a leg injury in the goalless draw with Dynamo Kyiv last month. Yet Pellegrini clarified it was not the 14th calf injury of the player\u2019s City career \u2013 as first thought \u2013 and that the captain can make a full recovery. \u201cThe medical reports say it is not linked to the other injury,\u201d he said, though Kompany will not be fit for Wednesday\u2019s trip to Paris Saint-Germain for the Champions League quarter-final first leg. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s related to his calf. Fortunately, it\u2019s in his other leg. I think that Vincent is improving well and hopefully we will see him playing soon; maybe not on Wednesday but soon. \u201cI think Vincent has some very bad luck this season but that does not mean in the future he will continue with the same things. We should be optimistic about him. He is a very professional player. I\u2019m sure he will do all he can not to have any problems in the future.\u201d Yaya Tour\u00e9 faces a race to be available for PSG because of a knee injury he has been carrying for a month and Joe Hart is out with a calf problem. Both miss Saturday\u2019s match."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
