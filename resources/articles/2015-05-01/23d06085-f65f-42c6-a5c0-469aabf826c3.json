The study, which was published in Science in December and was widely covered in the media, found support for same-sex marriage climbed among voters who had a single conversation with a gay or lesbian canvasser. In addition, the authors found that the changed views not only lasted for at least a year, but also positively influenced the opinions of other members of the household. The optimistic slant on human nature provided by the research evaporated this week, however, when Professor Donald Green retracted the paper. Green, a professor of political science at Columbia university, said he has now come to the conclusion that, while hundreds of California residents were canvassed for the study, followup surveys on which the results were predicated may have been fabricated by his co-author, Michael LaCour. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to convey to you the mountain of fabrication that accumulated in our dropbox folder over many many months,\u201d he told the Guardian. Announcing his decision to withdraw the findings, in a statement posted on the website Retraction Watch, Green wrote: \u201cI am deeply embarrassed by this turn of events and apologize to the editors, reviewers and readers of Science.\u201d LaCour, a graduate student at the university of California Los Angeles, did not respond when contacted for comment, but said on Twitter on Wednesday that he had read the report and was \u201cgathering evidence and relevant information so I can provide a single comprehensive response. I will do so at my earliest opportunity.\u201d The claims came after a group of researchers were unable to replicate the study\u2019s findings. David Broockman, a graduate student at Stanford university; Joshua Kalla, a graduate student at the university of California, Berkeley; and Peter Aronow, an assistant professor at Yale university, found a series of statistical errors in the data that raised questions about the integrity of the study. \u201cNo one of the irregularities we report alone constitutes definitive evidence that the data were not collected as described,\u201d the researchers wrote in a technical report on their findings. \u201cHowever, the accumulation of many such irregularities, together with a clear alternative explanation that fits the data well, leads us to be skeptical the data were collected as described.\u201d The three researchers approached Green with their concerns on Saturday, and sent their report on the finding of irregularities on Sunday. Green said that he had not been personally involved in the raw data collection or analysis and that there had been no hints until now that it could have been fraudulent. \u201cThe canvassing part of the study really did happen,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it seems that the surveys never measured the outcome. That did not seem to take place. Ironically, a study was conducted, we just don\u2019t know what the outcome was.\u201d Green said that after being sceptical about results from an initial study, in which around 500 people were canvassed and purportedly recontacted in a telephone survey, he had asked LaCour to reproduce the finding a second time. \u201cThey did it again in August 2013. After I saw those results, I was convinced. I thought \u2018I\u2019ve seen the magic twice now,\u2019\u201d he said. He adds that he is baffled about the motivation for any instance of scientific fraud. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to understand,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you go to the trouble of doing the experiment, don\u2019t you want to know the actual results? All that work, gone to waste.\u201d Green said he fears the episode will inevitably cast a shadow over his own scientific reputation. \u201cIt\u2019s an unfortunate but likely fact, when the last chapter of my life is written, this is going to be mentioned in it,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though it\u2019s an unexpected tragedy.\u201d After being alerted to the concerns last weekend, Green contacted Lynn Vavreck, a professor of political science at UCLA and LaCour\u2019s graduate advisor, who approached LaCour on Monday. According to Green, LaCour initially claimed that he deleted the source file accidentally, but a representative for the research software company that was used for the study who examined the account reportedly found no evidence of such a deletion. By Tuesday, LaCour allegedly confessed that he had not used the study\u2019s grant money to conduct the surveys. \u201cMichael LaCour\u2019s failure to produce the raw data coupled with the other concerns noted above undermines the credibility of the findings,\u201d Green said in the letter. The Retraction Watch blog noted that LaCour was due to become an assistant professor at Princeton university starting in July, but mention of that has since been removed from his personal website. Martin Mbugua, a spokesman for Princeton, confirmed that the university had offered LaCour a teaching position; at this time, he said the university is reviewing all available information to determine the \u201cnext steps\u201d. David Fleischer, a leader of the Los Angeles LGBT Center, which led the canvassing for the study, said: \u201cWe were shocked and disheartened when we learned yesterday of the apparent falsification of data by independent researcher Michael LaCour. We are not in a position to fully interpret or assess the apparent irregularities in the research as we do not have access to the full body of information and, by design, have maintained an arms-length relationship with the evaluation of the project.\u201d Green says that he now hopes to re-do the work from scratch. \u201cOne way to frame this story is as a tawdry tale of scientific misconduct, which it surely is,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is also a story of how scientific research has a self-correcting component to it. You make something up, someone tries to replicate it and can\u2019t. The whole thing unravels.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
