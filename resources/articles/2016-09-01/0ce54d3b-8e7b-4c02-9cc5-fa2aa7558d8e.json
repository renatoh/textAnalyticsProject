The side sitting second in the Premier League could not even blame a below\u2011strength team for the defeat. While Everton made six changes from their victory over Middlesbrough at the weekend, Norwich made 10 from the side that beat Nottingham Forest, and still managed a fourth successive win. \u201cWe\u2019ve just had three really hard games and I knew I had to freshen the squad up,\u201d their manager, Alex Neil, said. \u201cWe came with a plan to let Everton have most of the ball and see what they could do to us, and it worked. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we were the better team or not, they had all the possession but we scored the goals. The main thing is that we won, and that can only boost the players\u2019 confidence.\u201d Koeman said he was not happy about the result but accepted that Norwich had been more clinical in front of goal. The Everton manager said: \u201cWe had enough chances to win the game, and football is about scoring goals. \u201cI thought Norwich were a little lucky with the first goal but their second was really bad defending by four or five of our players. We must recover and react now. We don\u2019t organise parties when we win a game at this club and we don\u2019t cry when we lose.\u201d Apart from the shock result the game was notable for the round of applause the former Everton forward Steve Naismith received from the home support after putting the visitors in the lead. \u201cI think that speaks volumes for how highly the lad is regarded here,\u201d his manager said. \u201cThe crowd obviously appreciate his qualities, and I completely understand why.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
