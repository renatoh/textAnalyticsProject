It follows clashes between Italian police, Manchester United and Roma fans on Wednesday. Last night's quarter-final first leg at the Spanish club's Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan stadium ended in a 2-1 win for Sevilla but it was marred by disturbances as Tottenham fans battled with riot police, with seats thrown and seven Tottenham fans and one policeman taken to hospital. Police had separated supporters before the match as Tottenham fans made their way to the ground. Once inside, trouble broke out less than 30 minutes into the game in the enclosure where the 4,000 Spurs supporters were seated and riot police were deployed. Seats and punches were thrown as the the clashes continued during the half-time interval. A Tottenham fan at the match last night blamed \"over-zealous\" police. Daniel Wynne of Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust told Sky Sports News: \"After the equaliser, we saw there was a bit of animosity down in the lower tier. \"The supporters were trying to calm things down but it looked like the Spanish police, from where we were, started jabbing at them with batons.\" \"We saw a guy in a wheelchair get hit by a couple of batons, the police piling into him,\" he said. \"A perfect day was spoilt by some over-zealous police officers.\" Earlier, Manchester United supporters gave accounts of the violence that marred their Champions League match in Rome, accusing the police of brutality and gangs of attacking with machetes and chains. As the Home Office announced it was gathering information, Manchester United condemned the Italian police for a \"severe over-reaction\" and of handing out \"indiscriminate beatings\". But Rome's police chief, Achille Serra, said the incident lasted only two minutes and that \"criticising the police is a sport and the British always like to do this\". The British embassy said 13 United fans were taken to hospital and 50 were treated for minor injuries at the ground. Italian police said seven officers were injured. About 4,500 United fans had travelled to the match, despite warnings on the club's website that they might be the target of ambushes by Roma's \"Ultra\" fans. The worst injuries occurred outside the stadium, where up to 300 United supporters were reported to have been attacked. Supporters in the ground were charged by baton-wielding riot police after rival fans taunted each other and hurled missiles from opposite sides of a barrier. Stephen Fitzsimons, 51, a cleaner from Manchester on his first trip abroad, was set upon by five Roma fans and stabbed in the thigh as he got out of a cab. He had surgery at the San Giacomo hospital to control the bleeding. \"I was told if the blade had entered 2cm over it would have hit an artery and killed me,\" he said. His friends, Michael Skarratt, 51, from Rossendale, and Mr Skarratt's nephew, Stephen, 19, were both stabbed in the buttocks, a favoured tactic of Roma fans. Another United fan, Victor Hindley, 42, of Blackpool, said: \"The police were brutal. We got chased away from the ground...and then a gang of about 100 Ultras cornered us. Some of them had machetes and others had chains with padlocks. They just ran at us. I got hit loads of times and there was blood everywhere.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
