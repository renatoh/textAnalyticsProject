Only one can fill the Stadium of Plight,\u201d one wag tweeted on Tuesday morning. Others wondered whether Sunderland, the first town to declare for leave in the EU referendum, would mistake the track Freedom, from Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s current album, Lemonade, as a Brexit endorsement. But there were few such cynics among the near-capacity (tickets were still available, and selling for under face value before the show) crowd at the first European date of the Formation world tour. Beyonc\u00e9 has been opening her shows by advising audiences to shout \u201cI slay!\u201d \u2013 a canny way of spreading the fierceness. She is such a motherlode of confidence that she retired her Sasha Fierce alter ego several years ago because Sasha\u2019s work was done: Beyonc\u00e9 had integrated her private shyness and public forcefulness into the colossus Queen Bey, as she\u2019s known to her Beyhive fanbase. No other female singer is currently as influential; she\u2019s using her platform \u2013 and what a platform; the US leg of the tour grossed up to $11m a night \u2013 not just to sell her new Lemonade album, but to advocate for the Black Lives Matter movement, especially the lives of black women and girls, whose stories are in the fabric of Lemonade. One thing she can\u2019t control is the weather; it\u2019s hard to credit that she would let a mere drizzle stop play, but she was 45 minutes late. When she appeared, in the first of a dozen spangled leotards and flanked by a battalion of dancers, she instantly got the crowd onside by commanding, \u201cIf you\u2019re proud of who you are and where you\u2019re from, say: \u2018I slay\u2019!\u201d Seeming at once imperious and near-approachable is her speciality. Performing Lemonade\u2019s bitterest songs \u2013 Sorry and Don\u2019t Hurt Yourself, which address her husband Jay Z\u2019s unfaithfulness \u2013 she\u2019s a pillar of rage; minutes later, she\u2019s the proud mother, showing a picture of her daughter. Even the interludes were heavy with concept. While she changed costumes, excerpts from Lemonade\u2019s videos played across a large screen: here a razor blade emerges from her mouth, there she drives a monster truck, then her video image whispers: \u201cRest in peace, my true love.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 undoubtedly slays, whether by casually unfurling an early track, Me, Myself and I, that displayed her voice\u2019s richness, or by maintaining an intimidating chill during the anti-police brutality track Formation. Then there was the moment during Freedom when she executed a heavy-limbed ballet in a tank of water \u2013 in short, she cannot be accused of neglecting the visual side of performance. There are times, though, when her glittering magnificence and the pounding, brutalist rhythms of the new album induced a desire for a moment\u2019s respite. There are unexpected moments of levity, however, and plenty of genuine smiles \u2013 during an a cappella version of Love on Top, sung while seated, she seemed sincerely delighted to be in the nippy north-east, with only pyrotechnics to ward off the chill. Disgracefully, the glorious Crazy in Love and Bootylicious were dispatched in a three-minute medley towards the end, but that\u2019s her royal prerogative. As the stadium slowly emptied, nobody looked to have been short-changed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
