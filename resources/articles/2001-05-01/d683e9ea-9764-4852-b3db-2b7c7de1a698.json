The move by the watchdog has been prompted by the merger talks between Halifax and Bank of Scotland, which were said to be close to completion last night. Speculation that they were almost ready to reveal details of the deal mounted after BoS took the unusual step of calling off the presentation of its annual results scheduled for today. A combined Halifax/BoS is regarded as having the potential to create a \"fifth force\" on the high street to compete with Lloyds TSB, Barclays, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland/NatWest. That merger plan has surfaced since the competition commission began its investigation into the competition implications of Lloyds TSB's hostile bid for Abbey National. Denise Kingsmill, the competition commission deputy chairman, said last night she was writing to Abbey National and Lloyds TSB. \"We are inviting both parties to make rep resentations on how we should regard this new proposed merger.\" She has already suggested to the two banks remedies for any findings of anti-competitive behaviour. Her shortlist includes selling branches and disposing of subsidiaries, but did not rule out unconditional rejection of a merger. Much of her investigation, which began after the Lloyds bid was referred by the Department of Trade and Industry, focuses on the provision of current accounts, in which the \"big four\" have a combined share of over 70%. \"We are still a long way from having formed a view [on the competition implications of the Lloyds/Abbey deal]. A fifth force is one thing, real competition in current accounts is another,\" Mrs Kingsmill said. She has until mid-June to report to the DTI. The City has speculated that a BoS/Halifax merger will make it more likely that the Lloyds bid is cleared. Peter Ellwood, chief executive of Lloyds TSB, has said that the attempted merger between Halifax and BoS changed the \"competitive dynamics\" in the financial markets. \"It will create a major com petitor and therefore the idea of Abbey being a 'fifth force' doesn't have quite the relevance that it was mooted to have had,\" Mr Ellwood said. Abbey refused to comment last night but has resisted the takeover attempt by Lloyds TSB, which scuppered its own attempts to merge with BoS. The negotiations between Halifax and BoS gained pace after reports of the negotiations leaked. Both parties were last night trying to secure agreement on the composition of the combined bank's board and its headquarters. Both sides are thought to be working towards sealing the terms of the deal before the coming holiday weekend. But many issues are still to be settled. Among these are the precise number of job losses, perhaps in the region of 2,000 from a 57,000-strong workforce, and the amount of revenue the new group would make. Both sides are expected to insist the deal is not about cutting costs and that job losses will be kept to minimum and split evenly between Halifax and Edinburgh. At Halifax's annual meeting, held in Edinburgh, shareholders urged the management not to \"cave in to tartan tantrums\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
