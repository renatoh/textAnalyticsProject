How will the changes affect me?", "bodyText": "Traditionally, the beginning of a new tax year brings changes to taxes, benefits and the cost of some essentials \u2013 and despite the extraordinary conditions we are currently living in, this year is no different. From 6 April we will see changes to junior Isas, national insurance and inheritance tax (IHT), among many adjustments that will affect the pounds in your pocket. There were also a number of price changes that came into effect on Wednesday 1 April, dubbed by some as \u201cnational price hike day\u201d. Here\u2019s what is changing: National living wage \u2013 up 6.2% The national living wage for workers aged 25 and over increased by 6.2% to \u00a38.72 an hour from 1 April. Workers aged 21 to 24 saw their hourly rate increase from \u00a37.70 to \u00a38.20, while those aged 18 to 20 saw a rise of 30p to \u00a36.45 an hour. For people aged 18 and under, their hourly rate went up by 20p to \u00a34.55. The minimum wage for apprentices also increased, from \u00a33.90 to \u00a34.15. New two-week parental bereavement leave From 6 April, parents who suffer the loss of a child under the age of 18, or suffer a stillbirth from 24 weeks of pregnancy, will be entitled to two weeks\u2019 statutory paid leave. The new entitlement is known as Jack\u2019s Law, in memory of 23-month-old Jack Herd, who drowned in a pond in 2010. National Insurance \u2013 save \u00a3104 The threshold for national insurance contributions is increasing from \u00a38,632 to \u00a39,500 from 6 April. The new threshold means the average full-time worker will see their tax bill cut by \u00a3104 a year, and the typical self-employed worker by \u00a378. Prescriptions \u2013 up by 15p Starting on 1 April, the price of a prescription went up by 15p, from \u00a39 to \u00a39.15, in line with inflation. The cost of a prepayment certificate (PPC) \u2013 which lets you get as many NHS prescriptions as you need for a set price \u2013 also increased. A three-month PPC increased by 55p to \u00a329.65 and a 12-month PPC went from \u00a3104 to \u00a3105.90. TV licence \u2013 up \u00a33 The price of watching the BBC through buying a TV licence went up on 1 April from \u00a3154.50 to \u00a3157.50, a \u00a33 increase, or 2%. Council tax \u2013 up 3.9% The average council tax for a band D property will be \u00a31,817, up 3.9%. Junior Isas \u2013 allowance doubled There was good news for parents in the budget \u2013 the maximum amount they can save in a junior Isa for their child is increasing from \u00a34,368 to \u00a39,000 a year from 6 April. As with all types of Isa, there is no tax to pay on interest or capital gains on growth. State pension \u2013 up 3.9% The state pension will go up by 3.9% in April, the biggest rise since 2012. This means those receiving the new state pension (who reached pension age after 6 April 2016) will see an increase of \u00a36.60 a week to \u00a3175.20. Those claiming the old state pension will see their basic payment increase by \u00a35.05 a week to \u00a3134.25. Pension savings \u2013 good news for doctors High earners can save even more in their pensions from 6 April as the lifetime allowance (the maximum you can save into a pension before high tax charges apply) will rise from \u00a31,055,000 to \u00a31,073,000. There is also good news for high earners hit by the pensions \u201ctaper tax\u201d that resulted in top NHS doctors receiving large tax bills. The standard tax-free annual allowance on pension contributions is \u00a340,000 but this starts to taper down to \u00a310,000 for those earning more than \u00a3110,000. This allowance goes up to \u00a3200,000 from 6 April but the minimum floor will fall from \u00a310,000 to \u00a34,000. Student loan repayment threshold \u2013 up \u00a3850 Graduates will get a small boost in their take-home pay from April as the amount they can earn before starting to repay their student loan will increase from \u00a325,725 to \u00a326,575. Those who earn over this limit repay the loan at a rate of 9% above this figure, so the increase will mean graduates earning above the threshold will keep an extra \u00a376.50 of their pay. Inheritance tax \u2013 homes up to \u00a31m can avoid tax The nil-rate IHT band for anyone passing the family home to their direct descendants increases to \u00a3500,000 from 6 April. The family home allowance has increased each year since its introduction in 2017. In the 2020-21 tax year the final increase will be up to \u00a3175,000. Combined with the standard threshold of \u00a3325,000, it means many families will not pay IHT on estates worth less than \u00a3500,000, while couples will be able to leave estates worth up to \u00a31m before IHT kicks in. Buy-to-let Mortgage tax relief for buy-to-let landlords has been gradually phased out since 2017. The new tax year marks the final phase of its removal \u2013 this will affect higher and additional rate tax payers. Landlords can no longer deduct mortgage expenses from their rental income to reduce the tax they pay. Instead, they will receive a tax-credit, based on 20% of their mortgage interest payments. Landlords selling up will also be affected by new capital gains tax (CGT) rules, which come into effect in April."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
