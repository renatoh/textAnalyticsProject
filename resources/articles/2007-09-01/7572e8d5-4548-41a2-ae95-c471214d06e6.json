Jol's position at Tottenham has been uncertain following a dismal start to the campaign and the now-infamous meeting by club officials with Sevilla's coach, Juande Ramos. Jose Mourinho was also linked with the club after leaving Chelsea nine days ago but Jol has remained defiant throughout and said on Thursday that even the Portuguese manager may not have matched his consecutive fifth-placed finishes in the past two campaigns. Levy, speaking on Setanta Sports, said: \"Obviously with any speculation sometimes there's an element of truth, but there has been a lot of stuff that's been written in the papers which has just been completely untrue.\" Jol appears to believe his chairman's sentiments and feels the board have recognised his achievements by sticking with him after a start of just one win in seven Premier League games that has left Tottenham rooted in the bottom three. Expectations had been high before the start of the season after the club spent around \u00a340m on Darren Bent, Younes Kaboul, Kevin-Prince Boateng and Gareth Bale while hanging on to the likes of Dimitar Berbatov and Pascal Chimbonda despite interest from other teams. \"I think it's inevitable with the quality of players we have that when we're not performing on the pitch there's bound to be speculation,\" Levy said. \"I've made it very clear that I very much want Martin to succeed. Martin is fully aware of our ambition, he also has got ambition - he just needs to get results. I think we're all fairly thick-skinned, if I'm honest, and I just think Martin and the players need to ignore the outside pressure and just win and that's what it's all about.\" Ledley King's absence as he recovers from knee surgery has contributed to Spurs' troubled start, but Jol will not rush his captain back. The Dutchman does not want to set a comeback date for the defender after last season when the 26-year-old's injury problems dragged on for much longer than expected. \"He is progressing,\" said Jol. \"I cannot push him. He is not doing everything [in training]. He is not doing the overloading, the one-v-ones, the sprints. He is doing the normal work.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
