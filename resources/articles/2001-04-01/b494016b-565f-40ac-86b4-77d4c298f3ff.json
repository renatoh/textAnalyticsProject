Their future now lies in the hands of next week's opponents Ipswich, who must almost certainly lose that game before beating Derby on the final day of the season if Maine Road is not to taste relegation once again. It may sound unlikely, but anyone who saw this game will know that logic, in this season as in the previous two, has minimal influence on this side. When these sides met at Upton Park in November, City contrived to turn a 1-0 half-time lead into a 4-1 defeat. They could hardly have complained had history repeated itself here, as West Ham followed a miserable first half by assuming total control of the second. They created a succession of chances but were denied by a combination of the outstanding Carlo Nash in the home goal and remarkable misfortune. So often this season it has been the home side left cursing the fates on this ground. Their home record remains appalling despite a fourth home league win of the campaign and they must avoid defeat here once more still, albeit against a team in Chelsea whose away record is as bad as City's is at home. But luck was certainly on their side on this occasion. Even their goal owed more than a little to chance, as Shaun Goater's miserable, mishit effort bounced off Ian Pearce and into the net from Alf Inge Haaland's weak cross. 'Lady Luck's had her blindfold on this season as far as we're concerned,' said Joe Royle.' So I've got absolutely no embarrassment in admitting we were lucky.' This was an understatement as City simply crumbled in the second half. West Ham substitute Svetoslav Todorov was the man of most misfortune. He slipped past Richard Dunne on the hour, only for Nash to beat away his shot with a trailing leg. From the resulting corner, Danny Tiatto cleared Igor Stimac's header off the line. Still the chances came. Nash saved remarkably from Todorov's close-range volley and saw a header from the same player disallowed. Grounded after a collision with Dunne, Nash flung himself to save from Joe Cole before Granville headed Ian Pearce's follow-up of the line. Four breathless minutes of injury time saw Todorov head straight at the keeper from Davor Suker's cross and spurn an open goal after Nash had pushed out Paolo di Canio's shot. 'It was amazing,' said Harry Redknapp. 'I just don't know how he saved them. After the game Joe Royle told me, \"We've had more luck today than we've had all season.\" It had to happen against us though didn't it?' The Hammers can still not relax, themselves. 'But we need one point from two games to be safe,' Redknapp said. 'City need six points from two games. I'd much rather be in our position wouldn't you?'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
