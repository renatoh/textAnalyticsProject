Melania Geymonat, 28, and her girlfriend, Chris, 29, defiantly announced they would not be intimidated into hiding their sexuality, days after they said they were attacked by several young men when they refused to kiss upon demand. \u201cI was and still am angry. It was scary, but this is not a novel situation,\u201d said Chris. \u201cI\u2019m not scared about being visibly queer. If anything, you should do it more. \u201cA lot of people\u2019s rights and basic safety are at risk. I want people to feel emboldened to stand up to the same people who feel emboldened by the rightwing populism that is, I feel, responsible for the escalation in hate crimes,\u201d she told the BBC in a televised interview. \u201cI want people to take away from this that they should stand up for themselves and each other.\u201d Geymonat added: \u201cThe violence is not only because we are women which are dating each other. It\u2019s also because we are women.\u201d A Metropolitan police statement said: \u201cFour males aged between 15 to 18 have been arrested on Friday 7 June on suspicion of robbery and aggravated GBH. They have been taken to separate London police stations for questioning.\u201d The attack \u2013 in which a phone and a bag were stolen \u2013 happened in the early hours of 30 May. A photograph of the couple\u2019s bloodied faces went viral on Friday. In a Facebook post, Geymonat, a flight attendant originally from Uruguay, said in both English and Spanish that they were subjected to homophobic abuse while being beaten up: \u201cThey started behaving like hooligans, demanding that we kissed so they could enjoy watching, calling us \u2018lesbians\u2019 and describing sexual positions \u2026 The next thing I know is that Chris is in the middle of the bus fighting with them. \u201cThe next thing I know is I\u2019m being punched. I got dizzy at the sight of my blood and fell back. I don\u2019t remember whether or not I lost consciousness.\u201d Politicians roundly condemned the attack. Theresa May said: \u201cThis was a sickening attack and my thoughts are with the couple affected. Nobody should ever have to hide who they are or who they love and we must work together to eradicate unacceptable violence towards the LGBT community.\u201d The Labour party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said: \u201cWe must not, and will not, accept this homophobic and misogynist violence in our society. Solidarity to Melania and Chris, and to all in the LGBT+ community for everything they endure for simply being who they are.\u201d The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, urged witnesses to the \u201cdisgusting, misogynistic attack\u201d to come forward. \u201cHate crimes against the LGBT+ community will not be tolerated in London,\u201d he said. The women and equalities minister, Penny Mordaunt, said she was \u201cappalled to see this kind of homophobic violence in the UK, there\u2019s no place for this kind of vile behaviour in our society\u201d. The Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, in whose West Hampstead constituency the attack took place, said on Twitter: \u201cHorrified to see this homophobic attack against two women simply trying to enjoy a night out in West Hampstead. There can be no excuses, no space, for such obscene behaviour. My full solidarity is with these women and the UK\u2019s LGBT community.\u201d Reported homophobic hate crimes across London have increased from 1,488 in 2014 to 2,308 in 2018, according to the Met."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
