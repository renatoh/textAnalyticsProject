We are, as a nation, profoundly divided. While many are protesting strongly against her \"heinous legacy\", many others are proud to don black. For her supporters, she was the woman who saved Britain and restored the country's pride and economic fortunes. To them, she was one of our greatest political leaders of modern history, who regained a global role for the country and forged a new dynamic economic contract, bringing \"power to the people\", eliminating industrial strife, shaking the UK free from its sclerosis \u2013 and she was, in turn, rewarded with three electoral victories and an 11-year-rule. To her detractors, she wielded an almost medieval power, damaging communities still not recovered or reconciled 30 years on. She is the woman who wounded the unions, opened the doors wide to a neoliberal, materialistic individualism, ushered in a new era of toxic Toryism, laid waste to the country's manufacturing base, introduced privatisation and deregulated the City, leading to the economic and banking catastrophes of recent times. The sound and fury, the acrimony and opprobrium that has signalled this exercise in revisionism by all sides is an ironic endorsement of the very divisiveness that was an essential part of the Thatcher brand. It has also culminated in, at times, a surreal and inquisitorial media hunt for individuals seen to be showing a lack of respect, including those who gathered at yesterday's Trafalgar Square demonstration: anarchists, socialists, former miners, retired Class War warriors and anti-Thatcher party goers, citizens all. Inevitably, also in the sights of the critics is that recurring target, the BBC. This has culminated in the surreal decision that today's Radio 1 Chart Show will play only five seconds of the song from The Wizard of Oz that may reach the top of the charts, Ding Dong! The Witch is Dead. Those who fought most vociferously to have it banned are among those who fought so passionately to resist any Leveson-led censorship in the recent debate over press regulation. Banning things is easy. Tolerating views that challenge our own is more difficult. But a mark of a healthy, pluralistic democracy is surely one that can tolerate a juvenile if distasteful prank. Thatcher would have championed the democratic right of individuals to express their views however they so choose, within the law. How Thatcher will be commemorated in the longer run remains to be seen. Last Wednesday, Labour leader Ed Miliband, in a well calibrated tribute in the House of Commons, provided a reminder of how many barriers a grocer's daughter from Grantham had to overcome. The member for Finchley for 33 years was a candidate for Parliament in 1950 in Dartford, at the age of only 24. The only woman in the cabinet when she was appointed in 1970. And Britain's first and so far only female prime minister. \"Having broken so many conventions as a woman,\" Miliband said, \"it can't be a coincidence that she was someone who in so many other areas of life was willing to take on the established orthodoxies \u2026 she believed that ideology mattered. She said, 'Consensus doesn't give you any direction. It is like mixing all the constituent ingredients together and not coming out with a cake. Democracy is about the people being given a choice.'\" Already, in formulating the first drafts of history, her followers are anxious to iron out the contradictions and inconsistencies. But they are as much part of her legacy as her convictions and obsessions \u2013 she left intact, for instance, the NHS when rolling back the state. They reveal the pragmatism that she displayed often, waiting her time, for instance, before, in 1984, taking on the miners. Likewise, her critics often ignore her achievements \u2013 and the challenges she faced. She choose, for instance, to disregard how the 70s had become a moribund decade of \"dysfunction, decay, demoralisation and drabness\". \"There is no future in England's dreaming,\" roared the punk band the Sex Pistols in God Save the Queen. Then, as now, the postwar consensus was already fraying because capitalism, for the first time since the 50s, could no longer deliver on the promise of continual improvement to living standards, as inflation soared. Workers constantly went on strike to defend their livelihoods, scalping two prime ministers in the process. Industrial relations were sclerotic, union barons stopping and starting the economy and holding power with extensive restrictive practices that stifled growth. At the same time, the state's ownership stretched quaintly from Gleneagles hotel to include all the utilities, airports, canals and the post office. The consumer was the pauper in the system, poorly treated by trains that ran late, phones that failed to work and waits for hospital appointments that could last hours. Steve Hilton, Cameron's former head of strategy, says in his innovative argot that Thatcher was a \"disrupter\". She shook up rather than conserved. But in doing so, she also imprisoned herself and her successors in a tight corset of ideology. The often painful consequences of her policies have also meant that toxicity is hard to expunge from the Tory image. The north of England, Wales and Scotland have \u2013 since her time in office \u2013 become barren areas for Conservatives seeking election. Ironically, some of her staunchest supporters seem not to have noticed that her legacy has cost them dearly in electoral terms and almost certainly deprived them of more parliamentary majorities. Hilton last week hailed her transformative power when he said: \"Being reasonable doesn't get you very far. In government, it is unreasonableness that improves people's lives.\" But when Hilton was sending Cameron off to hug a husky or a hoodie, he must have been aware that he was trying to detoxify a brand that had become \"unreasonable\". And being \"unreasonable\" is how so many commentators ended up last week, with two tribes fighting old battles, kicking up much dirt, raising their voices but adding little of nuance, or even reason, to the debate over her legacy. In 1945, Thatcher read Friedrich Hayek's The Road to Serfdom. He was in favour of a small state, no centralised control, low taxes, privatisation. In his view, collectivism led to socialism and totalitarianism. Unemployment would be the price of keeping down inflation. Thatcher married those neoliberal beliefs to her Christian conviction and her espousal of the Victorian virtues of thrift, self-help and responsibility. She told one interviewer that poverty was essentially self-inflicted, a matter of lack of \"character\". Her views cast a long shadow over today's welfare reforms. However, it would be myth-making to believe that it was the force of her ideas alone that burnished her reputation. She was also fortuitous in the timing of her arrival in power. North Sea oil poured billions into the Treasury coffers. Unlike Norway, that money was not put into a trust to finance pensions and social welfare; instead, in part, it subsidised the rising benefits bills of what would become 3 million unemployed. Thatcher was fortunate in both the calibre (or lack of it) of her opponents and her fans, Arthur Scargill, General Galtieri in the Falklands, Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev. In addition, she faced a riven opposition. And Labour's timidity goes some way to explaining the rise of Thatcher. Labour had considered including the sale of council houses in its 1959 manifesto but, showing a lack of spine not for the first time, it decided not to upset its activists. In 1969, it failed to introduce reform of the unions when it refused to implement Barbara Castle's In Place of Strife white paper. These issues only came back, in more vigorous form, under a Thatcher government. So how would an initial audit of Thatcher's 11 years in office weigh up? In spite of the rhetoric, public spending during her rule never fell below 39% of GDP, so the frontiers of the state were only very partially rolled back. She abolished state controls, deregulated the City with the \"Big Bang\" of 1986, sold more than a million council houses, reduced inflation from over 10% when she came to power in 1979 to 2.4% in 1986. The top rate of tax fell from 83% to 40% and the days lost to strikes dropped from an incredible 29 million in 1979 to a mere 2 million seven years later. These were undoubtedly measures of success \u2013 but at a personal cost for millions that continues to be felt today. And her advocacy of freedom had its limits. She constantly reined in local government, abolishing the Greater London Council in the process. She refused to allow local authorities to replace or repair social housing. Privatisation also had its successes but its disasters too. As James Meek \u2013 formerly of this parish \u2013 has pointed out previously, her privatisation programme was supposed to be about giving \"power back to the people\". But as he noted recently: \"It's clear that the result of privatisation was to take power away from the people. Small British shareholders have no influence over the overwhelmingly non-British owners of the firms that generate and distribute power in Britain.\" The same is true of many of Britain's privatised companies now owned and run by foreign investors and management. And in a timely reminder of just how we Britons benefited from privatisation, yesterday six big energy suppliers were accused by the industry regulator Ofgem of \"cold-blooded profiteering\", averaging \u00a395 profit per household. Steel, coal, shipbuilding and manufacturing were all brutally pruned or axed altogether. In 1979, more than 7 million had been employed in manufacturing; 14 years later, that figure had dropped to 4.4 million and the mushrooming service sector couldn't absorb them all. In the eight years to 1987, employment fell by 1.3 million in the north and increased by 3,500 in the south, a regional disparity that Labour failed to properly address during its 13 years in charge. Equally, to blame Thatcher's right-to-buy policy for the housing crisis that currently afflicts Britain is to ignore the fact that, among others, the Labour party spent many years in government not addressing this issue. But there was nothing inevitable about Thatcher's \"unreasonableness\", even allowing for Britain's particular problems at that time. Other countries, without her moral crusade, made more compassionate transitions. Germany, for instance, has retained a strong manufacturing base, has low youth unemployment, works co-operatively with unions and has a more diversified economy. Mitterrand supported France's manufacturing base with subsidies, though Britain and France's industrial decline over the next 20 years was almost identical, which suggests that a different, less disruptive approach might have delivered the same dividend. Without the rancour. Thatcher has rightly been lauded for her intolerance of eastern Europe's repressive regimes and she was instinctively right to rail against regimes that brutalised opponents, refused democratic reforms and withheld basic personal freedoms from many. But the moral compass she deployed surveying the USSR and its client states served her less well on other international journeys. Among those she admired and supported were a number of men distinguished only by the craven brutality they showed in domestic affairs. Dictators such as General Zia-ul-Haq of Pakistan, Pol Pot of Cambodia and Chile's Augusto Pinochet. So will Thatcherism become a small foot-note in history or will it have a long lasting effect, pulling the centre ground to the right on a permanent basis, as Stuart Hall, the man who coined the phrase \"Thatcherism\", originally warned in 1979? On Wednesday, Thatcher will be accorded due ceremony for her unique contribution to British history. For now, a degree of harmony has been established amid the ongoing discord, focused on her qualities of courage, determination, stoicism and authenticity. Last week's rancour and division was dispiriting. There was much that was discordant about Britain in the years immediately before and during her years in government. But last week was a salutary lesson in how discord in politics also infects society. Different communities across Britain were affected in very different ways by Thatcher's time in office. Last week was a reminder that if you set out to be a \"disrupter\" then disruption may well follow. The animosity that broke out last week is a long way from the vision of a Big Society that many community-minded Conservatives strive for. Some of what Thatcher set out to do needed to be done. More of what she did had unforeseen and unfortunate consequences. The free market was unleashed, with no thought to the regulatory checks needed to weigh against excess. But very little of what she did had to be executed in the tone and register in which she operated. The problem with being \"unreasonable\" is that it lacks reason."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
