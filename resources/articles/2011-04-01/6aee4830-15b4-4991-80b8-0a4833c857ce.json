When I was keeper of paintings at Manchester City Art Gallery in the 1960s, I displayed its Lowrys alongside its mostly British Surrealist paintings. Lowry himself made regular visits to the gallery. Besides Rossetti and the Pre-Raphaelites, he liked the Surrealists. I think he enjoyed the juxtaposition. Elizabeth Conran Barnard Castle, Co Durham \u2022 Could Andrew Lansley answer a simple question (NHS chiefs predict ward closures, 20 April)? The banks have failed; the NHS is a success: so why do bankers get bonuses and hospitals get closed? Kevin Donovan Birkenhead, Merseyside \u2022 Since David Cameron is so opposed to alternative vote (Cameron and Miliband to lock horns over AV, 18 April), he will, presumably, do the honourable thing \u2013 resign and hand over to David Davis. Davis was first past the post in the Tory leadership election and Cameron won because the Tories use the AV system, which gave him second preference votes. Kenneth Brown Bisley, Gloucestershire \u2022 Just voted Yes for AV with my postal vote in Scotland (Polly Toynbee, Comment, 19 April). Dr Allan Dodds Nottingham \u2022 While not a monarchist, I find myself strangely in sympathy with the Queen over her reported habit of vaguely looking at pictures while Martin Amis talks to her (Pass notes, 20 April). Angela Barton Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire \u2022 Hasn't this dreadful man gone yet? As the Bard wrote: \"Stand not upon the order of thy going, but go at once.\" Please! Joyce Aydon South Newington, Oxfordshire \u2022 Half-price breaks, including Spiral Guide and Paris map (Advert, G2, 19 April). Does it mean tourists who follow Inspector Laure Berthaud's trail of mutilated bodies may not need their return tickets?
