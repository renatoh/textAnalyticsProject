In a county that packs in more scenic variety than any other, the Quantocks are a jewel. Their intimate combes and chuckling streams are a homely contrast to the bleak mystery of the Levels, a few miles to the east, to the hazy bowl of Taunton Deane to the south - best viewed from Cothlestone Hill above Bishop's Lydeard - and to the bracing western scrubland of Exmoor. Although Wordsworth needed to return to his Lakeland roots for his masterpiece, 'The Prelude', it was in Somerset that he rediscovered his poetic fire after his involvement in revolutionary France, and here the Devonian Coleridge wrote all his major poems. It was here that they conceived, in search of quick funds from a Bristol publisher, their Lyrical Ballads , one of the cornerstones of English Romanticism. The year, 1797-98, that they and Dorothy Wordsworth walked the hills was perhaps the most concentrated period of creativity in poetic literature. During this time the Wordsworths rented the big house at Alfoxton near Holford, now a country-house hotel. If you ignore the fact that the pub opposite Coleridge's cottage in Nether Stowey is called The Ancient Mariner, the industry surrounding the poets in Somerset is as low-key as the countryside is beautiful. The local tourist board may have different ideas, to tie in with the release of the film Pandaemonium , which animates the relationship between the poets (played by Linus Roache and John Hannah) and is largely set in Somerset. However, it is inconceivable that the vulgar paraphernalia of some literary shrines will infect this secret corner of the country. It is still possible to walk in the poets' footsteps, to feel their spirits in the landscape, even to hear echoes of Coleridge's tireless and animated conversation. One of the most celebrated walks resulted in the composition of Coleridge's visionary fragment 'Kubla Khan', in the autumn of 1797. This poem provides the climax of Pandaemonium, although by then the movie has moved way beyond literary history. Coleridge left Nether Stowey car rying a copy of the 1614 book Purchas his Pilgrimage, which includes the line 'In Xanada did Cublai Can build a stately Pallace'. He also took his supply of opium. Coleridge walked west to Porlock. Once a port, this picture-book village became separated from the Bristol Channel by a huge wedge of fertile silt in the Middle Ages. He continued to the 'new' coast at Porlock Weir, and then made the dramatic zig-zagging tramp along the cliff-top to the tiny medieval church at Culbone, the smallest in regular use in the country. The church, dwarfed by the silent hills, has an extraordinary atmosphere, and on that day its spirituality mingled with that of the book he had with him. He sought shelter in a nearby farmhouse. Here he took opium (as always his excuse was purely medical, a headache or an upset stomach), and in his stupor dreamt a com plete poem. He was feverishly scribbling it from memory when he was interrupted by 'a man on business from Porlock'. When this notorious killjoy left, the rest of the poem left with him. The farm most commonly identified is Ash Farm, south of Culbone. Tom Mayberry, chairman of the Friends of Coleridge, has mapped out such journeys in his fascinating book Coleridge and Wordsworth in the West Country (Alan Sutton 1992; revised 1994). In his room at the Somerset Records Office he told me he has always rejected the Ash Farm assumption. 'There is no way of walking sensibly from Culbone to Ash Farm,' he says, ignoring the fact that Coleridge may not have been particularly sensible at the time. 'Withycombe Farm is the obvious destination. There's a brook close by that fits the poem's imagery.' In Coleridge's day a broad track ran from the church to Withycombe, bolstering Mayberry's theory, but the farm was demolished in the mid-nineteenth century. You can find the site on an elbow in the lane between Ash Farm and Silcombe Farm. He may have continued west along this route, and after a round trip of two days he was home, depressed by the partial loss of 'Kubla Khan'. In November a momentous walk took place, resulting in Coleridge's epic 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner'. The poets and Dorothy strode west towards Watchet. They planned a ballad with a supernatural theme, and Coleridge recalled that a friend in Stowey had recently recounted a dream about a ghostly ship. They reckoned the poem should be worth a much-needed fiver. They came down from the hills into West Quantoxhead and headed for the harbour at Watchet. This is undoubtedly where the Mariner sailed from. See it before it fills with yachts - the paper industry is long dead, and soon the weekend sailors will move in. During their overnight stop at the Bell Inn, Coleridge reputedly began to write his poem. From Watchet they journeyed to the Valley of the Rocks and then across Exmoor to Dulverton. Their likely return would have been north-east over the Brendon Hills, through the valley in which the Taunton-Minehead road now runs, and up into their beloved Quantocks. As the 'Mariner' developed, now completely Coleridge's work, they abandoned their original idea of a quick sale. The concept of the Lyrical Ballads was taking place, with the 'Mariner' as a cornerstone. Throughout his time in Stowey, Coleridge strode talkatively over the Quantocks to preach at the Unitarian Chapel in Mary Street, Taunton, which now bears a plaque recording the association. From his cottage in Lime Street, right into Castle Street and left towards Marsh Mills, the modern road follows the logical path up and over the Quantock spine, descending into Kingston St Mary down beautiful Buncombe Hill and on into Taunton. His other preaching trips took him due east to Bridgwater, where he drew crowds to the chapel in Dampiet Street. On his walks with William and Dorothy, Coleridge planned another epic to be called 'The Brook'. As with many projects that crowded into his imagination, the poem remained unwritten, but we can still follow the brook that proved a continuing inspiration to both poets. This was a walk that they took many times, sometimes in the company of house guests such as Lamb and Hazlitt. The brook rises near Robin Upright's Hill, and down into Holford Combe. Here it flows over a hidden waterfall that to the poets was a potent symbol of the inspirational power of nature. Near Holford village it joins another tributary that runs down Hodder's Combe. It then runs north to Kilve, near the Hood Arms, and on to 'Kilve's delightful shore', where it bubbles on to the beach. This fossil-rich slate shore is unique, its slanted layers of glistening rock hiding a myriad of pools. The Hood Arms, by the way, does a decent lunch for pilgrims. During these walks, with their note-taking and the 'foreign' accents of the two Lakelanders, the trio were assumed to be foreign spies, and were trailed by a Home Office agent. Eventually he concluded that they were not dangerous, merely mad. A modern Romantic would be similarly mad not to hit these unspoilt trails, maybe with some modern horse-power to cover the Tarmac in between them, but certainly with Mayberry's inspirational book (and perhaps a second-hand discovery of Berta Lawrence's Coleridge and Wordsworth in Somerset) , an Ordnance Survey map, and the chattering ghosts of Sam and William for company. \u0095 'Pandaemonium' is out now on general release."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
