The picture is mixed, and the report makes a series of radical policy proposals designed to ensure the UK maintains its competiveness in this vital sector. What Learning Needs: The challenge for a creative nation by Rachel Jupp, Ciara Fairley and Tom Bentley Creativity in schools is too important to be dismissed as \"trendy teaching\", and must become a core part of the curriculum is pupils are to be equipped to survive in the knowledge economy. What Learning Needs, which is published in partnership with the Design Council, makes a series of recommendations for radically reshaping the education system and the teaching profession itself. Gaia: The next big idea by Mary Midgley, May 2001 Gaia, the idea of life on earth as a single, self-sustaining system, can help to provide solutions for problems from global warming to mental health and well-being. But its significance often been missed by scientists, decision-makers, intellectuals, and the media. Mary Midgley sets out the origins of Gaian thinking, showing how it challenges our everyday thinking and behaviour. Basildon: The mood of the nation by Dennis Hayes and Alan Hudson, March 2001 Using new analysis of the last two elections and in-depth interviews, the aurthors ask how this bellweather town has fared under New Labour. They find a surprising level of disenchantment with the government and, more worryingly for all politicians, a disengagement from politics itself. The report questions how political parties will connect with voters in the run up to the next election. Transformation not Automation by Daniel Stedman Jones with Ben Crowe, March 2001 This report warns that the UK's current e-government initiatives are not sufficiently \"joined up\". It calls for a more connected strategy that links government departments together, and transforms their relationship with citizens. Automation simply isn't enough. The real goal for e-government is the transformation of services to meet the needs of citzens. Divided By Information? by Perri 6 with Ben Jupp, March 2001 The digital divide is not about access to computers. The real issue, which has been missed by Government in its enthusiasm for putting PCs in public places, is exclusion from society by information rather than from information. In the long term, the growth of exclusion by information raises fundermental questions about social mobility and the role of the state. Welfare That Works by David Pinto-Duschinsky, January 2001 Government welfare to work programmes should be restructured to put employers at their heart and make a significant contribution to full employment. David Pinto-Duschinsky argues that a \"demand led\" welfare to work system would best be led by sectoral employer organisations, working with service providers. In the long run, these new institutions could cover much of the economy. Linking Home and School by Ken Worpole, December 2000 In Britain choice of housing and of schools are inextricably linked. Performance in school league tables can send house prices soaring or tumbling and trigger neighbourhood renewal or decline. Ken Worpole examines the links between housing and education policies and their connection to wider issues of neighbourhood regeneration and community development. People Before Structures by Paul Brickell, December 2000 This pamphlet from Professor Paul Brickell argues that clues to successful regeneration may be found in the details of people's lives - particularly the lives of people on the margins. It is these details which cause us to question the effectiveness of committee-based structures in promoting community involvement. Enterprise Learning Matthew Horne, October 2000 Enterprise learning should be an essential component of all students' preparation for adult life, says Matthew Horne. 'Enterprise Learning' argues that the government must make radical changes to the National Curriculum. The Third Way to a Good Society by Amitai Etzioni, July 2000 The Third Way debate has, so far, been largely a failure. In this groundbreaking essay, the US professor Dr Amitai Etzioni offers a powerful account of what the Third Way really means, and roots it in a vision of the \"good society\". Patient Power by Peter Lilley, June 2000 In this report Peter Lilley makes a compelling case for making health services more responsive by giving patients real choice over where and how they receive treatment. \"Patient Power\" looks like becoming one of the key agenda-setting books on health policy in the new century. Entrepreneurship and the Wired Life by John Gray and Fernando Flores May 2000 The career is in unstoppable decline, argue Professor John Gray and Fernando Flores. But new ways of working are evolving to replace it. These range from entrepreneurialism - working in partnerships and within communities - to, at the other extreme, the \"wired life\" - fast globally networked and individualistic. Working Together by Ben Jupp, May 2000 Cross-sector partnerships are very much in vogue at the moment. In almost every area of policy, partnership between government, business and community organisations is relied upon to solve problems and produce results. But are they working? Family Business by Helen Wilkinson, February 2000 A definitive collection of essays edited by work and families expert Helen Wilkinson on the increasingly complex negotiations between work and family life. \"A 'must read' for anyone juggling work and family life\" - The New Statesman. Animal Rights and Wrongs by Roger Scruton, February 2000 Roger Scruton's Demos pamphlet on animal rights has been republished in book format by Metro publishers. First published by Demos in 1997, \"Animal Rights and Wrongs\" sparked a nationwide debate on the merits of bloodsports which is even more pertinent today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
