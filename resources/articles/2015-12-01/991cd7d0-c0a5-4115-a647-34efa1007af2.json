The 31-year-old, twice a runner-up at Roland Garros, had not played an ATP World Tour event since 2011 after contracting infectious mononucleosis, a viral illness also known as glandular fever. \u201cI\u2019ve realised that I will not be healthy enough to be able to play tennis at the level I demand of myself,\u201d Soderling told tennis.se. \u201cFor that reason I have decided to end my career as a professional tennis player.\u201d \u201cThank you so much for all your kind words. So sad I won\u2019t play professional tennis again, but reading all your messages makes me feel a lot better,\u201d Soderling said later on his Twitter account. Soderling spent 10 years on the Tour and rose to world number four. In 2009 he ended Nadal\u2019s domination in Paris with a stunning victory in the fourth round, only to lose to Roger Federer in the final. Until Novak Djokovic defeated Nadal in the 2015 quarter-finals, Soderling was the only player to have beaten the Spaniard at Roland Garros. Soderling, who won 10 career titles including the 2010 Paris Masters, returned to the final at Roland Garros in 2010, losing in straight sets to Nadal. He won the 2011 Swedish Open shortly before being diagnosed with glandular fever \u2013 meaning that the final, where he defeated David Ferrer, proved to be the last Tour match of his career."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
