Talent, after all, is nothing without fortitude. At the position of three over par after two holes Woods was in danger of being a US PGA footnote. His latest tournament obituary was being penned. Often lost in discussion of the 42-year-old\u2019s remarkable career is his ability to scrap like a seasoned street fighter. Woods retrieved all of his shots before signing for a level\u2011par 70 that will have him glancing towards the leaders on Friday as opposed to fearing a missed cut. \u201cIt kept me in the tournament,\u201d Woods said of his recovery. \u201cI could have easily gone the other way, being three over through two. A lot of things could happen, not a lot were positive but I hung in there and turned it around. I was able to grind out a score.\u201d His determination was typified on the 15th, his 6th. Having found dense shrubbery twice he played a chip to within 3ft of the cup to save par. Rory McIlroy\u2019s drive, clean approach and two putts appeared bland in comparison. Fowler has been in this position many times. An opening round of 65 was notable for his accuracy as the 29-year-old hit 16 of 18 greens in regulation. By close of play, Fowler had been headed by Gary Woodland\u2019s 64. There was an element of surprise to that; Woodland has no top 10s in his last 27 major appearances. If, as has been widely mooted, the course layout in Missouri more resembles a standard PGA Tour event than a major then Fowler has great cause for hope. He is yet to win one of the big four but has far less trouble converting promise into tangible reward on standard tour weeks. Cruel history, including at this event in 2014 when he was denied by McIlroy, has taught him not to look far ahead. \u201cI\u2019m definitely happy but on Thursday you can\u2019t win the tournament, you can definitely take yourself out of it and lose it, so we took care of what we needed to take care of today and we move on,\u201d Fowler said. Ian Poulter has the same aspiration as Fowler in seeking to crown years of eminence with a major triumph. His 67 kept the dream firmly alive. After a spell in Europe and having seen the dismal weather forecast for St Louis in the early part of this week, Poulter arrived a day before competitive action started. \u201cI hadn\u2019t been home [to Florida] since the 20th of May,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it was good to get back, have a rest, unpack, fill the fridge full of food, have a couple of nights sleep in my own bed and come up early on Wednesday morning. I feel refreshed after a couple of days at home.\u201d Deep emotion would be attached to a Jason Day victory. The Australian was rocked by the pre-tournament news that his close friend and compatriot Jarrod Lyle had died from leukemia at the age of 36. Lyle and Day began competitive careers in the United States at the same time. \u201cI received a text about Jarrod. It\u2019s hard because you sit there, you know him, he\u2019s a buddy of yours and he\u2019s not there anymore,\u201d Day said after his 67. \u201cHe\u2019s never going to come back. That\u2019s the hardest thing to sort of come by. \u201cI lived across the street from him when we first started out in Orlando. He was a good buddy of mine. It\u2019s heartbreaking. My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife and two kids.\u201d McIlroy matched Woods\u2019s score. The third member of this marquee group, the defending champion, Justin Thomas, is one under. McIlroy missed a series of opportunities to produce a better score but railed against the widely held notion that Bellerive is there to be butchered. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear any of that from the players,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s from people that aren\u2019t playing in the tournament, that haven\u2019t played the course and they really don\u2019t know.\u201d McIlroy wore a protective strapping on his right arm but played down any suggestion of a serious problem. There was a denial, too, from the PGA of America regarding the tournament being affected by the hacking of the association\u2019s computer files. The hack was accompanied by a ransom demand via a bitcoin address in the same week Tommy Fleetwood\u2019s Open winnings were paid into someone else\u2019s bank account. The European Tour got the wrong Tommy Fleetwood. It used to be such a simple game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
