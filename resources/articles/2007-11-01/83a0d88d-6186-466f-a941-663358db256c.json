Thirteen judges of the supreme court of Pakistan are under either house arrest or in prison. Only four judges of the highest court under the constitution of Pakistan agreed to take the oath under President Musharraf's provisional emergency order. The lawyers imprisoned or under house detention, surrounded by police and soldiers, include Aitzaz Ahsan, president of the Supreme Court Bar Association and Munir Malik, former president of the SCBA. There are many, many others. The arrest and imprisonment of those whose lives have been committed to human rights and democracy is catastrophic as well as repugnant. The British government should authorise their representatives in Pakistan to visit these courageous people in their prisons or houses surrounded by police and soldiers, to ensure their safety. The British government should also ask the president, military generals and officers to release these prisoners and immediately allow them to talk and write freely, and resume their constitutional and legal positions, and their human rights work. The independence of the judiciary, its right in law to challenge a government, and the rights and freedoms of lawyers to challenge human-rights abuses in the courts are not only cornerstones of a democratic state - they are also fundamental to maintaining the security of all peoples against extremists and terror in any shape or form.
