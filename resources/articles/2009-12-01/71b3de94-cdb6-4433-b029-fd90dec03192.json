To lead up to the release of Guy Ritchie's idiosyncratic Sherlock Holmes interpretation, Warner Bros has commissioned a fascinating co-operative experience entitled 221B. Accessed via Facebook Connect, it's a sort of Myst-style graphical adventure, in which players must solve a series of crimes by reading witness reports, analysing evidence, interrogating suspects and occasionally chasing shadowy ne'er-do-wells through alleyways in Flash minigames. The really clever bit is that when you sign-up, you select whether you want to play as Holmes or Watson, then nominate a friend to take on the other role \u2013 both players need to work together as they'll receive different clue elements; Watson isn't privy to the crime scene data while Holmes doesn't have the stomach for interrogations. Players can swap theories via an in-game notebook before coming to a series of deductions about each crime scene. Correct deductions earn you reputation points, which can be spent on getting hints later on when your detection skills become unstuck. The presentation is absolutely beautiful, filled with authentic-looking Victorian documents, mini-movie segments and sepia-tinged photographs. The point-and-click interface is clear and intuitive, allowing you to discover and investigate multiple sources as well as filter evidence (focusing on certain characters or types of document, for example) to aid in your process of elimination and cross-referencing. New cases will be released every week up to the movie's Boxing Day release, and the game narrative leads neatly to the opening of the film, providing a few titbits about the film's antagonist, the Catacomb killer\u2026 221B is a great little game in its own right, but it's also an important exploration of new interactive storytelling possibilities. \"Our intention,\" explains the game's creators in their press release, \"is to take the things we love about ARG - the mystery, the excitement, the conversation and collaboration - and marry them with elements more traditionally found in adventure games - locations to explore, characters to interrogate (through natural language AI, which we're very proud of), even villains to pursue (in the form of flash games).\" 221B was created for Warner Bros. Pictures by futuristic media agency AKQA and Hide&amp;seek, a social gaming collective, responsible for lots of interesting pervasive gaming projects as well as its own festival. Through the combination of social networking staples (there are Twitter feeds, too, including the amusing diary of Homes' landlady, Mrs Hudson) and the cooperative investigation techniques invited by the augmented reality gaming genre, it is doing some really cutting edge stuff with the notion of online narratives and meta-narratives. As with Smoking Gun Interactive's similarly intriguing Exoriare it hints at a near-future in which demarcations between gaming, online socialising and web surfing become irrevocably blurred.
