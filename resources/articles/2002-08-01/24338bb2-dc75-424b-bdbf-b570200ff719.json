The news that Gordon Brown has set aside \u00a33bn over the next three years to drag the public sector into the electronic age is good news (E-democracy's eleventh hour, July 18). However, it is questionable whether this investment will ultimately deliver real value to the taxpayer. Unlike health and education, throwing vast amounts of public money at an IT problem is rarely the answer. The dotcom bust-up is proof that reckless spending without careful planning could make this the biggest waste of taxpayers' money ever. Jason Vokes Borland European product manager jvokes@borland.com Kiss me It must be a sign of old age when remarkably young-looking entrepreneurs discover the software techniques I learnt at the same time as how to use a Hollerith card punch. So \"extreme program ming\" (Online, July 25) \"keeps software design as simple as possible\": have these people never heard of KISS - keep it simple stupid - which was around 30 years ago? The underlying reasons for many software project failures can be summarised very simply - they were solutions looking for problems. Congratulations to Entranet for realising this. David Gilbert david_gilbert2@compuserve.com Further works Some additional suggestions of \"interesting\" IT/PC books to read (Summer of content, July 18): The Mighty Micro, by Chris Evans, who seemed to have forecast quite a lot of what has happened and other things that are still to happen - and two books about the Apple history Odyssey by John Sculley and West of Eden by Frank Rose. Which is the most objective? Peter Lewis Jones plj@manorresources.co.uk Burning mail In its latest attempt to harass its users into paying up or moving elsewhere, Hotmail has deleted all messages from sent mail folders that are more than 30 days old. I had lengthy emails there going back three years; they wiped out 1800kb of my life. I don't say the deletion of my emails alone eclipses the burning of the ancient library of Alexandria. But once again it shows the arrogance and contempt of Microsoft. Alexander Barley alex_barley@hotmail.com Up to speed New technologies are sometimes viewed with the same scepticism that the first fax machines received. That is: \"What's the point if I am the only one who has got one?\" Yet the government is leading the way in the promotion of XML to meet objectives for 100% of services to be delivered electronically by 2005. Staff in accounts departments are spending hundreds of hours a month re-keying data into purchase ledgers when a straightforward, new email technology called XML -eXtensible Mark-up Language - will handle that process for them, with a return on investment unrivalled by that of EDI. Richard C Pierce, MD PS Financials plc richard.pierce@ps-financials.com Why me? Frank Close (Watching the detectors, July 25) asserts that physics can tell us \"why we're here\", and \"why there is any material universe at all\". He is using the word in a non-scientific way that confuses the issue. Science is concerned with third-person knowledge about how the material world operates. It has no concern with the first-person relationships at the heart of the\"why\". Alan Smithson Alansmm@aol.com More BTales I would like to add my voice to the chorus about BT. Continual problems with their mail servers and extremely irritating disconnections seem the norm now. They do not normally respond and if you can get hold of anyone, it doesn't bring much relief. It doesn't help if you write to the chief executive, Ben Vervaayen, either. Several weeks ago, exasperated at BT's failure to do something as simple as send one of their Openworld CDs to a relative, an email to Vervaayen brought a further promise of action but has still brought no CD. They have only been waiting five to six months now! Peter Thompson peter.thompson@btconnect.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
