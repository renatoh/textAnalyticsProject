A regular laptop still prevails as the best tool for the portable user. Until they can perfect handwriting recognition it will only be a toy to play with, and not very useful when you need to write something quickly. John Horvatic San Francisco \u00b7 The reason you can't do everything you do at your PC on your mobile phone is because your carrier (at least in the US) still controls both the pipe and the applications. Just like fixed line carriers always have. The result in the fixed line world: the most innovation in the past 100 years has been call waiting. blog.nextblitz.com \u00b7 I know someone who's a family friend of Steve Jobs. From what she has said about him ... he's a pussycat. psynixis.com/blog \u00b7 What I find most interesting about Apple/Steve is that he tells everyone else what they want and pulls it off.

Dr David Zeitlyn University of Kent Blue light thinking I quote your article \"Why isn't there a text version of 999?\" (October 19).

Sending a text often works when reception is too weak for voice (eg. hill walking or at sea) or battery is low. John Cady Not the best option Your article is correct (Is Steve Jobs Off The Hook? January 4). If the SEC serves him, he will likely settle with them for a few hundred million. He will be banned for life from public companies in regard to executive positions etc. If he gets into trouble criminally, then he will not be consulting. If he just has a problem with the SEC, he will be free to consult, however, he more will likely start a private company to dally in, one that will not go public while he runs it. Cecil Koupal Life force to reckon with Since October, I've been tabulating the numbers listed on Second Life's front page (Are there really 2m people using Second Life?, December 21). It looks like even under the most conservative growth rate, we will see 3.5m users registered and over 600,000 using the service by the end of April 2007.
