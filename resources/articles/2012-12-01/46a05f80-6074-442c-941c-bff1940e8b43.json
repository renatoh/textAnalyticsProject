In targeted online media, banner ads contrast \"hardworking families\" and \"people who don't work\", illustrated by a man sitting at home on his sofa. The ads link to a survey on the Conservative website which asks: \"Who do you think the government should be giving help to?\" Michael Dugher, the MP for Barnsley East and vice chair of the Labour party, said the campaign was a new low for the Tories. \"To deliberately mislead people in this way is not only dishonest; it is also offensive to all those hard-working families who make up the majority of the people the government is choosing to hit,\" he said. The Tories said the adverts were in response to a Labour advert in marginal Tory seats where the number of families receiving in-work tax credits was greater than the MP's majority."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
