The team released a statement Thursday that said Taubman\u2019s conduct did not reflect the organization\u2019s values \u201cand we believe this is the most appropriate course of action\u201d. Sports Illustrated\u2019s Stephanie Apstein reported Taubman yelled toward a group of female reporters about closer Roberto Osuna, who was suspended last year for violating MLB\u2019s domestic violence policy before being traded from Toronto to the Astros. The report said the 34-year-old Taubman \u201cturned to a group of three female reporters, including one wearing a purple domestic-violence awareness bracelet, and yelled, half a dozen times, \u2018Thank God we got Osuna! I\u2019m so fucking glad we got Osuna!\u2019 The outburst was offensive and frightening enough that another Houston staffer apologized.\u201d The Astros\u2019 initially rebutted the story, saying \u201c[Taubman\u2019s] comments had everything to do with the game situation that just occurred and nothing else\u201d, and accusing the magazine of \u201cfabricating\u201d the report. Major League Baseball said Wednesday they would speak with the Astros to determine whether the commissioner\u2019s office or the club will handle any decision regarding Taubman\u2019s status. On Thursday, the team announced they had terminated Taubman\u2019s employment with the organization, adding: \u201cWe sincerely apologize to Stephanie Apstein, Sports Illustrated and to all individuals who witnessed this incident or were offended by the inappropriate conduct.\u201d The Astros have dropped the first two games of the World Series at home to the Washington Nationals with Game 3 scheduled for Friday night in the national\u2019s capital."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
