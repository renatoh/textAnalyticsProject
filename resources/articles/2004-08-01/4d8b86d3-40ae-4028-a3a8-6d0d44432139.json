The accounting profession's Joint Disciplinary Scheme has been investigating the role played by Ernst &amp; Young at Equitable for almost two years and has recently written to the firm detailing a series of complaints it is minded to lay before a disciplinary tribunal. The expected complaints are understood to relate to Paul McNamara, the lead audit partner responsible for signing off the mutual life insurer's accounts, a second Equitable partner, and to the UK practice as a whole, auditor to Equitable from 1990 to 2001. Each has until Friday to respond to the JDS, which will consider any submissions before formally laying any complaints. The JDS has the power to impose unlimited fines and strike off firms and individuals from their professional bodies. Yesterday a spokesman for the accountancy firm confirmed it was preparing a robust response to the JDS's proposed complaints. \"We believe the allegations are misguided and we will vigorously defend [ourselves against] them.\" Ernst &amp; Young is also defending itself against a \u00a32.6bn claim filed by a new Equitable board, under chairman Vanni Treves. It accuses the auditor of failing to warn former Equitable directors of the risks associated with guaranteed annuity payments to policyholders. Equitable, which has about 750,000 policyholders, was forced to close to new business in December 2000 after the House of Lords ruled against it over its treatment of guaranteed annuities. The ruling cost the society \u00a31.5bn. While the JDS prepares to lay disciplinary charges relating to the role of Ernst &amp; Young, its investigation into the role of former Equitable non-executive director Peter Davis and an unidentified former Equitable manager is ongoing. Mr Davis, a member of the mutual life insurer's audit committee, was the only chartered accountant on the Equitable board. He is among nine former independent directors being sued by the new Equitable board for a range of alleged oversights. Many of the part-time directors were described in Lord Penrose's report into the Equitable fiasco as \"incompetent\". Scrutiny of Mr Davis's role comes eight years after he came in for intense criticism in his then role as lottery regulator. He had accepted a number of flights from G-Tech, a firm linked to Camelot. He had earlier extended Camelot's lottery operating contract despite declining ticket sales and a competing bid from entrepreneur Richard Branson. The Equitable board is also suing six former executive directors for breach of fiduciary duty between 1996 and 2000. Former chief executives Roy Ranson and Chris Headdon could also face disciplinary charges from the Institute of Actuaries, though it has still not decided whether to launch an investigation. Last month, the Financial Services Authority imposed a six-year ban on Mr Headdon's working in any related industry. A similar action against Mr Ranson was dropped this year because of his age. Also last month, the government gave parliamentary ombudsman Ann Abraham permission to investigate the Government Actuary's Department in a move that could lead to some compensation for policyholders should she find clear regulatory failings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
