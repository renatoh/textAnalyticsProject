This blast from Ankara came in response to Macron\u2019s announcement of a series of measures intended to \u201creform\u201d the practice of Islam in France and end \u201cIslamist separatism\u201d \u2013 proof, to Erdo\u011fan, that Macron had \u201ca problem with Islam\u201d. Then, just five days later, on 29 October, a newly arrived Tunisian immigrant killed three Christians at prayer in Nice. France had yet again been the victim of \u201can Islamist terrorist attack,\u201d Macron proclaimed. He did not need to remind his countrymen of the beheading of schoolteacher Samuel Paty by another immigrant, this one of Chechen descent, in broad daylight two weeks earlier, or of the prior stabbing of two people outside the former offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The execution of Paty, the murders in Nice, and the Paris stabbings are just the latest in a series of attacks that have claimed the lives of 260 French citizens since 2012. No one can deny that France has a terrorism problem. Erdo\u011fan, keen to distract from Turkey\u2019s economic difficulties, chose to characterise France\u2019s defensive response as an attack on \u201cmillions of members from different faith groups.\u201d But Erdo\u011fan is hardly the only critic of France in the Islamic world. Demonstrations against France\u2019s supposed \u201canti-Islamic\u201d stance, as well as boycotts of French products, erupted in Bangladesh, Qatar, Lebanon, and other majority-Muslim countries. For quite different reasons Macron is taking criticism from inside France as well. His critics on the right are portraying him as soft on terror. Christian Estrosi, the mayor of Nice, called for \u201cchanges to the constitution\u201d to facilitate \u201cwaging war\u201d on terror. With characteristic hyperbole, \u00c9ric Ciotti of the Republicans declared that \u201cfor the first time since the occupation, France is no longer free! Our country is at war! \u2026 We must annihilate the Islamists!\u201d Calls for a suspension of civil liberties, as in wartime, are growing louder by the day, despite the fact that sweeping powers accorded to the authorities in previous \u201ctemporary\u201d states of emergency remain in effect. Yet such measures can do little to ferret out lone-wolf jihadists with no known connection to organised radical groups. Meanwhile, critics on the left, such as Cl\u00e9mentine Autain, charge the French president with \u201ctrampling liberty and democracy underfoot\u201d. But the left is hardly united in this view: the former Socialist prime ministers Bernard Cazeneuve and Manuel Valls believe that the far left, besotted by multiculturalism, blithely underestimates the Islamist threat. More strident critics accuse Autain and her allies in Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s France Unbowed party of \u201cIslamo-leftism\u201d and even \u201ccomplicity\u201d with jihadists. On the far right, Marine Le Pen has gleefully congratulated Macron for accepting her \u201ccommon sense\u201d view of \u201cIslamism\u201d as the implacable enemy while accusing him of \u201cmistaking saying for doing\u201d. Cynics on all sides insist that Macron was aping Le Pen\u2019s stance so as to steal her thunder should she mount another presidential challenge in 2022. Yet Macron\u2019s early October speech on \u201cIslamist separatism\u201d can hardly be characterised as Le Pen-inspired. He tried to trace a careful path through the ideological minefield, but emotions unleashed by the ensuing atrocities soon wrested control of the debate from his hands. In truth, however, his attempt to frame the issue narrowly, as simply a matter of redrawing the line traced between religion and state by the French law of 1905, was never likely to succeed. As Jean Birnbaum explained in Le Monde: \u201cIt is impossible to understand jihadism without reasoning, as the jihadists do, on an international scale.\u201d Macron did briefly evoke the global context of the struggle, but only to shift all responsibility to the Muslim side, describing Islam as a religion \u201cin crisis\u201d: \u201cTensions between fundamentalisms, between truly religious and political projects\u201d were to blame, he argued, while saying nothing about the long history of conflict between the Muslim and non-Muslim worlds. If Erdo\u011fan was later able to grotesquely twist the French president\u2019s words into an attack on Muslims generally, he was aided by the ambiguities of Macron\u2019s all-too-cursory diagnosis. The disparity between the lofty rhetoric of Macron the political thinker and the more martial tones of the commander-in-chief also helped. The president exhorted his \u201cdefence council\u201d that \u201cIslamists must not be allowed to sleep tranquilly in this country.\u201d True, this change in tone came after Paty\u2019s barbarous beheading, when emotions were running high, but Macron\u2019s pugnacity tended to erase any goodwill he had previously earned with his frank recognition in the October speech that the Republic was not blameless in creating the dilemma it has been dealing with for decades: \u201cWe have constructed our own separatism,\u201d he said, \u201cin our neighbourhoods, creating ghettos, at the outset with the best intentions in the world \u2013 but we let it happen \u2026 We concentrated misery and difficulties, and we know it.\u201d When it came to proposing remedies, however, Macron played down France\u2019s responsibility, perhaps because he had already rejected an ambitious approach that he himself had once advocated. Early in his presidency he had assigned Jean-Louis Borloo to look into the problems of France\u2019s suburban ghettos only to dismiss the report submitted in 2018. He did briefly acknowledge one key element of the Borloo report, conceding that \u201cradical change\u201d was needed in France\u2019s social housing. He devoted much more attention, however, to the alleged shortcomings of Muslim schools and mosques, sports clubs, and fraternal circles, emphasising the kind of minutiae that the administrative state excels at regulating: foreign funding of Islamic schools would be cut off, French universities would train and license imams and teachers of Arabic, halal meals would be banned from school cafeterias, no municipality would be allowed to offer separate swim times for men and women in its pools, and home schooling would be prohibited. Yet regardless of what such small-bore regulatory measures may accomplish, it is hard to believe that they will do much to advance the other aspects of Macron\u2019s five-point programme, namely, to create an \u201cenlightened Islam\u201d in France and \u201cto make the Republic once again beloved\u201d by its citizens. What Macron has failed to notice is that these two tenets stand in opposition to each other. To \u201cenlighten\u201d religion is to quench the passions of faith with cool reason, while inflaming patriotic passions with talk of war achieves precisely the opposite. The best way to defeat impassioned jihadists might just be to demonstrate by example that cooler heads can indeed prevail, even in the face of repeated provocation and jingoistic reaction. The disjunction between the president\u2019s philosophical flights and his more mundane regulatory agenda unfortunately leaves him defenceless against those who, like Ciotti, see no alternative to \u201cannihilating\u201d the enemy. But then again, with the passionate declaration \u00e9crasez l\u2019inf\u00e2me!, the enlightenment extolled by Macron had its own anti-religious war cry: \u201ccrush the vile thing\u201d. \u2022 Arthur Goldhammer is a writer, translator, and senior affiliate of the Center for European Studies at Harvard University \u2022 This piece was amended on 4 November 2020 to reflect Macron\u2019s reference to \u201cIslamist separatism\u201d, rather than \u201cIslamic separatism\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
