Researchers at the University of Kansas have established that even though Kansas is indeed flatter than a pancake, it is far from the flattest American state. In 2003 three irreverent geographers reported, in the Annals of Improbable Research, that they scaled up the topography of a fresh pancake to the size of a state and found that, indeed, Kansas would be flatter. The unflattering comparison festered for a decade before the fightback. Two Kansas geographers have now used software, space observation data and a new algorithm and ranked all 48 contiguous states for flatness, to deliver in the journal Geographical Review the deadpan conclusion that, first, Kansas is only the seventh flattest state in the US (and the winner is: Florida!) and, in fact, all 48 states failed to match the soaring contours of a scaled-up pancake. As the authors put it, perhaps a little flatly: it's a matter of perception."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
