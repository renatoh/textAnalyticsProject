They had long identified the Anglo-Welsh competition as a priority this season and, roared on by a raucous home support, the Chiefs won with tries from Chris Whitehead and their captain, Dean Mumm, one in each half, to achieve a significant landmark for a club who joined the top flight in 2010. The result avenged a one-point league defeat by the same opponents on this ground last month and ended Northampton's 13-match unbeaten run. The Australian lock Mumm hailed the achievement: \"I haven't been at this club for a long time but it's a very proud area of England in terms of its rugby prowess and this club has a very proud history. \"It's a great moment, our first piece of silverware in the top league. Throughout the second half I thought our defence was outstanding. We were under quite a bit of pressure territorially, as well as they had a lot of possession. We stood up strong.\" The Chiefs drew first blood inside five minutes when their hooker Whitehead touched down after a rolling maul from a lineout close to the Saints' line. The fly-half, Henry Slade, missed the conversion. His opposite number, Glenn Dickson, popped over a penalty in the 12th minute to close the gap to two points. There followed 20 minutes of Northampton pressure but Exeter managed to fend them off with some scrambled defending. Slade spurned an opportunity to extend Exeter's lead as his 33rd minute penalty drifted left but he made amends three minutes later to give Chiefs an 8-3 lead at the break. Exeter started the second half the stronger. In the 50th minute they worked the ball along the line before the Tongan winger Fetu'u Vainikolo broke through on the left and handed on to the Zimbabwean No8, Kai Horstmann, to feed Mumm who muscled his way over for a crucial score. Slade converted and suddenly the Chiefs were cruising. They almost put the game beyond doubt when the full-back, Luke Arscott, went on a fine 50-yard run but he spilled the ball when challenged just short of the line by the Samoan centre George Pisi. Northampton kept the pot boiling when Christian Day sent his fellow lock Samu Manoa over in the corner with 10 minutes to go. Chiefs hung on despite Slade seeing a penalty opportunity rebound off the upright. Northampton's director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, was left to rue his side's first-half failings: \"We talked about getting a good start and we had a poor start.\" \"We dropped the ball and they scored from the driven lineout, so we went behind. We did get a bit of pressure then and what you want to do is score from that and take your opportunities. We didn't. I remember a five-metre scrum on their line. We had a lineout close to their line, as well and just couldn't get over. So that made it a little bit uphill.\" Exeter's head coach, Rob Baxter, said: \"The big thing for me is to see the players get a reward. They've worked so hard this season and we've not always had the reward for our hard work. I think today they did.\" Exeter Arscott; Vainikolo, Dollman, Shoemark, Jess; Slade, Lewis (Thomas, 67); Moon, Whitehead (Cowan-Dickie, 66), Tui (Brown, 66), Mumm, Welch, Ewers, White (Armand, 51), Horstmann.
