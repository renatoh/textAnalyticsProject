Like the final days of his illustrious career, however, it did not quite go exactly to plan. \u201cI actually joined in for a bit of five-a-side,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was OK \u2013 the kids were happy because I lost twice but maybe tomorrow we can get some revenge.\u201d The South African, who made more than 200 appearances for Everton in two spells, was back on Merseyside in his new role as club ambassador to take part in a weekly coaching session for refugees and asylum seekers. Part of Everton in the Community\u2019s efforts to provide support for some of Liverpool\u2019s most deprived people, Pienaar knows all about battling against the odds. Born in the township of Westbury in Johannesburg during the apartheid years, the 36-year-old\u2019s career took him to Ajax as a teenager and also encompassed spells with Borussia Dortmund, Tottenham and Sunderland. Now, with a record number of 60 clubs from across the country set to take part in Amnesty UK\u2019s second Football Welcomes initiative this weekend after the success of last year\u2019s inaugural event, Pienaar is hoping schemes like Everton\u2019s can continue to improve the assimilation process. \u201cWe are working with kids from different parts of the world and trying to give them an opportunity to learn English,\u201d he says. \u201cFootball is a special sport which brings people together \u2013 whatever problems you are having in your life they all seem to go away when you get on to the pitch. I was born in apartheid South Africa and I know how sport, including football, can help to bring people together and break down barriers. I\u2019ve been in that situation and I\u2019ve always wanted to get involved with the community.\u201d Started in 2015, it is estimated 140 young people from 25 countries including Eritrea, Iraq, Sudan and Somalia have already benefited from Everton\u2019s community project. Similar initiatives such as Middlesbrough\u2019s Club Together scheme have sprung up around the country as Britain\u2019s football clubs attempt to help ease the transition to a new country. On Saturday, 12 Premier League clubs including Arsenal, Everton, Tottenham, Crystal Palace and West Ham will be among those showing their support and solidarity with refugees through a variety of activities and events. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see even more clubs laying aside their rivalries this weekend and coming together to say refugees are welcome here,\u201d says Naomi Westland, Amnesty UK\u2019s Football Welcomes manager. \u201cAt a time when politics is often dominated by hate-filled and divisive rhetoric, this shows that there is another story to be told. Football clubs are at the heart of their communities and have a vital role to play in helping people who have fled conflict and persecution settle in to a new country and culture.\u201d Arsenal\u2019s Granit Xhaka, Victor Moses of Chelsea, Stoke\u2019s Xherdan Shaqiri and Manchester City women\u2019s striker Nadia Nadim are among a number of players currently employed by English clubs who were once refugees. They are following in the footsteps of six children who escaped the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s who became professionals, including Norwich\u2019s Antonio and Jos\u00e9 Gallego. More than 80 years on, the Championship club is hosting Norfolk Welcomes \u2013 Football Welcomes, with children from 61 local schools sending questions to the club\u2019s Bosnia and Herzegovina international Mario Vrancic, whose family escaped the Balkan war in the 1990s. \u201cIt was clear the war in Bosnia was coming and we had to leave to find safety,\u201d he recalled this week. \u201cMy entire family went to different countries. The hardest thing was leaving my grandparents behind and trying to start a new life in a new country.\u201d A number of other initiatives down the football pyramid will also be taking place, including tournaments run by refugee teams in Chichester, Plymouth, Manchester and Leeds, with Women\u2019s Super League sides Durham, Reading, Sunderland and Tottenham all offering free tickets for their matches. Pienaar, who played just four matches for Bidvest Wits in his homeland before being forced to retire due to mounting injury problems, now plans to move into coaching after this summer\u2019s World Cup. He is grateful to be a part of Everton\u2019s community work after not having the chance to bid farewell when he left the club in 2016. \u201cIn my last season I was fighting with a lot of injuries and I knew my contract was coming to an end,\u201d he says. \u201cI just wanted to go out on the field just to say goodbye. I was disappointed but it\u2019s in the past and we just have to move on. To get the chance to come back and do something like this with Everton is fantastic.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
