Hi, how are you Small Talk? It's all good. Enjoying the bonniness of Scotland. As a commentator you're a poacher turned gamekeeper, do you ever take it in the neck from the players? All the time. It's quite interesting, even the most throwaway comment, someone always hears it and it always effects somebody. I've never intentionally criticised a player, it's my job to report on what I've seen and try to give some insight. Neither do I smooth everything over, if I see something that I think isn't right I'll say so. Anyone ever get particularly irked by you? Phil Mickelson was upset with me many years ago. He was reading putts and [his caddie] Bones wasn't and I said, 'Phil and Bones can't come to terms with reading the greens this week, so Phil is doing it on his own'. I didn't think there was anything to it but the media got him straight after and said, 'I hear there is trouble between you and Bones'. All of a sudden Mickelson wouldn't talk to me for years. I spoke to him a little bit at Augusta this year, but only a few words. You were second in the Open at Royal Troon in 1989, does that haunt you? Ever feel like punching Mark Calcavecchia? Oh yeah. Back in 2003 I walked over to the driving range and he was practising flop shots and he skimmed this flop shot and it flew across the green and I said, 'You bastard, you should have done that on 12 in 1989'. Instead he hit one of those and it went straight in the hole and he made birdie instead of six. Of course I would have loved to have won two majors [Wayne won the 1990 PGA Championships] because one is almost considered a fluke\u2026 I think only by professional golfers, we mortals don't consider one major to be lucky.What is your favourite Open course? This one [Turnberry]. I played here in 1994 and I thought it was a fantastic golf course. I didn't do any good, I happened to see the results the other day, I shot 68, 74, 67, 75 or something like that. I finished about 40th, I didn't finish well but I thought the golf course was great. Your website says you turned pro at 16 and then 'regained your amateur status' \u2013 doesn't that just mean you just stopped earning any money? [Laughs like a man with lots of money] No. Back in those years you had to do your three-year apprenticeship to turn pro, so I went into the pro shop to do the apprenticeship and after six months I just said, 'No, I want to play golf not teach golf'. And that is no slight to all the club professionals around the world. You'd no patience for curing the club hacker's slice? No. I'd have given them all tennis racquets. Speaking of rackets \u2013 you design golf courses. A bunker here, a steam there and a green with more crevices than Ben Nevis and Bob's your uncle. No more than that to it, is there? Well there is, not that I'm saying I'm any good at it. You use as many natural features as you can, if you're fortunate enough to get some rolling countryside with some trees all the better. If you've got a flat piece of desert in Florida it's a lot more difficult and you've got to be more creative. There is an art and a science to it. Do you ever sit down with your pen and paper and start maniacally laughing like a Bond villain as you draw up a particularly nasty hole? Well I can't draw. I really enjoy standing on that piece of land, looking at it and thinking out how the hole will look, where the bunkers will go and how the green will sit. It's a lot of fun being on the ground doing that. You are a fly boy. What was more nerve-wracking \u2013 holing the winning putt at Shoal Creek to win the PGA or landing a plane for the first time? Um. [Blows a raspberry] Probably winning at Shoal Creek. Landing a plane for the first time on your own, you've just done it a few times so the difference is the instructor gets out. I got a call from the tower saying I had better hurry up because I had a 737 on my tail. That got my attention. I did have one scary moment with a plane, I had an electrical failure and I couldn't get the landing gear down, which was quite interesting. Luckily I had someone in the backseat [says the master of understatement] because there is a redundancy and there's a handle with which you can wind the gear down, but the handle was caught in its cover and I had a utility tool and I handed it to him and he had to cut the thing away to get the handle out and finally we got it down. There were three TV cameras at the end of the runway. No drama then? You didn't have to change your underwear? No no. I parked the plane, went into the airport and had a beer. And rented a car and drove home. Small Talk is a bit obsessed with the moon landings at the moment, as a pilot do you also take an interest? I wrote to Nasa when I was six years old and said that I wanted to be an astronaut. I never got a reply. I wanted to be in the airforce before I started playing golf \u2013 I've always loved planes and I'm fascinated by them. I could sit at an airport all day and watch planes \u2013 an airport to me is like a golf course, I just love looking at both of them. Have you ever landed a plane on a golf course, thus combining your two loves? No. Thank goodness, I've never had to. I've spent a day on the Enterprise (the aircraft carrier, not the starship), that was sensational. I wanted to be in the airforce, but then I had a bit of trouble in school. I didn't like authority, teachers and I never really got on, so at about the same time I took up golf and that was that. Amen. Say a lion and a tiger have a fight in the schoolyard, who ends up licking their wounds? A lion, it's king of the jungle. A sacrilegious statement when one is within a 10-mile radius of a certain Mr Woods, but we'll forgive you. What would you put in Room 101? I'm thinking Mark Calcavecchia. [Laughs] Travel. A common complaint among Australians. What is the last book you read? Game of Shadows, because I'm absolutely opposed to drug cheats \u2013 they should be in jail for fraud. It's just wrong. Game of Shadows is about Barry Bonds, Balco and a man called Victor Conte, who supplied Marion Jones and Tim Montgomerie and others with their drugs. Do you think it is a problem in golf? I don't know. I'm glad we're testing, I know it is an onerous thing. It's great news that they haven't had any positives. I used to say no but now I say everyone should be tested. What is the last movie you watched? The Hangover. Funniest show I've seen in a long time. You're an Irishman, you will understand. What's the last CD you bought? I haven't bought a CD for\u2026 I think my iPhone has one song on it, it's the Bee Gees' Alone. The Bee Gees alone on their own. Kylie Minogue or Cheryl Cole? Cheryl? Don't know her. You fond of Kylie? I think she's done a fantastic job. I've lived in America for the last 25 years so I haven't been up with the Kylie hype. With that stunning indictment of Ms Minogue's global appeal we'll let you go. Lovely talking to you Wayne. No problem, Small Talk.
