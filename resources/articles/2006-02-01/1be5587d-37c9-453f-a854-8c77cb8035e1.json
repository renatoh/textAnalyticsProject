Kew Gardens", "bodyText": "Alfred Noyes urged everyone to \"go down to Kew in lilac time, in lilac-time, in lilac-time\". And who would not take his excellent advice? Or at almost any other time of the year too. Even if nothing was being done in the way of improvements, it would be difficult not to praise Kew Gardens and its 300-acre paradise of trees, shrubs and tropical plants. But plenty of improving is being done. Next month there will be the opening of a brand new Alpine House plus a bridge across the lake. For the first time in recent memory, Kew Palace will be reopening too, built by George III, whose association with Sir Joseph Banks, the great naturalist who travelled with Captain Cook, led to the Kew of today. It is partly because of a continuation of Sir Joseph's entrepreneurial instincts that Kew is now enjoying such acclaim. Last week it was revealed that during 2005, a year blighted by terrorism elsewhere in London, Kew recorded a 26% increase in visitors while most other capital attractions such as the National Gallery, Tate Modern and the London Eye fell by over 10% (Tate Britain was one of the few other exceptions to this trend). Kew's success was partly down to the BBC series, A Year at Kew, but that too would not have happened had it not been for the sustained reinvestment that Kew has undertaken over the years. In recognition of this effort Kew was granted World Heritage status in 2003, a richly deserved award for a institution that has moved with the times without losing its soul."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
