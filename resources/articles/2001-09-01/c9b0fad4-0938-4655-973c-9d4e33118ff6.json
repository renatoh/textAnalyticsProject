The consoling lie or the unpalatable truth? This is the enduring theme of American drama from O'Neill onwards, and it's certainly what animates Tennessee Williams's once-banned, emotional pile-driver of a play now getting one of its rare but welcome London revivals. Seeing it again, I'm struck by how close Williams skates to melodrama. What is at stake here is Big Daddy's Mississippi Delta inheritance, which consists of \"28,000 acres of the richest land this side of the valley Nile\". He desperately wants the land to pass to his son, Brick, an alcoholic ex-football player plagued by self-disgust. In the first act we see Brick taunted and provoked by his sexually desperate, childless wife, Maggie. And in the second, even more powerful act we see Brick forced to confront his sexual ambivalence, while Big Daddy comes face to face with his own impending death. If I invoke melodrama it's because Brick is obviously a damaged idealist, while Gooper, his fraternal rival for the estate, is a grasping lawyer. This is good guys versus bad guys. The qualities that lift the play into another sphere are Williams's gift for gothic comedy and the supple, sinuous nature of his prose. Williams was always a humourist, and Maggie's sexual rage is made all the sharper by her detestation of her sister-in-law's children, whom she accurately categorises as \"no-neck monsters\". And his language, even if it sometimes strives for poetry, has a deadly accuracy - as when Maggie tells Brick that \"We're not living together, we're occupying the same cage.\" Anthony Page's new production does not efface memories of Howard Davies's at the National in 1988, but it gets across Williams's barbed comedy and emotional fervour, and it has the advantage of three American actors in the lead roles. Frances O'Connor's Maggie the cat has exactly the right feline sexiness, lust for territory and frantic restlessness. Brendan Fraser, in the more difficult role of Brick, strongly suggests a man whose senses are dulled by his prodigious alcohol intake but who has an acute sense of the corruption and mendacity that surrounds him. Ned Beatty may not be as earth-larding as some Big Daddies, but he gives us all the character's chauvinist coarseness, savage humour and apprehension of death. And more than holding her own against her American colleagues, Gemma Jones memorably turns Big Mamma into a frightened and pathetic vulgarian who shows a bit too much bosom and totters around like an ambulatory rose garden. This is a production that captures well the passion and power of the state of Tennessee. \u0095 Booking until December 22. Box office: 020-7494 5045.
