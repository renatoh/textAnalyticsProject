At a time when many independent schools are working to make closer links with the maintained sector, the last thing they want is to have their efforts undermined by a grab for headlines. Parry's views contribute nothing to the debate. When he has been in his post for longer (assuming he lasts), he will discover that there is good and bad in both sectors. I hope those people responsible for appointing Parry to the post will make clear to him the responsibility required in such an important position and encourage him to consider the effects of what he says. David Whittle Oakham, Rutland I've spent 45 years in schools, the last 10 as a trainer and assessor of teachers in state and independent schools. The worst behaviour I have witnessed by far was a couple of years ago in a prestigious independent school. The language used by the sixth former to a teacher would have made a punk rocker wince. When I questioned the trainee teacher about it, he said pupils had the attitude that as their parents were paying a good sum for their education they felt they could talk to the teachers as and how they felt fit. Peter Stammers Banstead, Surrey What a broadside from Rear Admiral Parry! Clearly the only solution is to hand all children over to private schools to be disciplined and pacified. That way we might get some real public benefit from the \u00a3100m-plus charitable status will give them, instead of simply subsidising a luxury education for the better off. Tony Mitchell Bedford \"How can you expect to get an Oxford graduate out of that group when they are being bullied,\" says Chris Parry of state school pupils. As a pupil at a \"top\" public school, I saw a degree of bullying I have not seen in any other context, sanctioned by staff as part of the \"school culture\" of letting the kids sort out their own problems. It included an unofficial \"gay table\" where those whose behaviour fell anything short of macho were forced to sit at mealtimes amid ridicule. Parry needs to read a good definition of bullying, with real life examples, and reflect on them at length. Dr Jon Bowen Oxford"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
