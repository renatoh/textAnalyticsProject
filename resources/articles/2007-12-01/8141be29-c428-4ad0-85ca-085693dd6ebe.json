But a new arrival at Heathrow seeks to end the misery of killing time at the airport, at least for those who can endure four hours in a small box. Tucked away on a mezzanine floor in Terminal 4, Yotel is a Japanese-style pod hotel devised by Simon Woodroffe, the man who brought raw fish to Britain's popular consciousness with Yo! Sushi. Behind its plain wooden doors, \u00a325 buys you four hours in a seven-foot-square futuristic cabin which includes a bed, toilet, shower and desk. There are flat screen \"techno wall\" TVs with internet access, movies on demand and a menu of homely dishes such as butter bean pie. The first Yotel opened at Gatwick in the summer and there are also plans for one in central London. Business people who want a shower, a quick kip and a quiet place to work are key customers, according to operations director Nigel Buchanan, as well as passengers on early flights. Prices increase by \u00a35 an hour to a maximum of \u00a356 for an overnight stay in standard. A 10-square-foot double starts at \u00a340 and goes to \u00a382. Middle-aged couples do not pop in for illicit liaisons. \"Personally if I was wanting to conduct an affair I'd take someone to the country, not an airport,\" says Buchanan. Inside the cabins are padded curvy edges, brushed steel and mirrors. The only window looks out on to the internal corridor, but working at the fold-down desk is not much more claustrophobic than elsewhere in an airport. There are UK and continental plug sockets, and wireless and wired connections. A trio of switches control the mood lighting: purple for relaxation, white for reading in bed and yellow for feeling like you're in an aeroplane toilet. Only a glass wall and a curtain separate the living space and the bathroom in standard, and the uncarpeted floor feels a little depressing. But the bed is a treat, the mattress firm yet comforting and the duvet enticing. The fluffy white towels and sage and seaweed body wash from the Isle of Arran are an infinite improvement on the customary loo roll and soap dispenser rub down. \"We're in the business of selling sleep, but we're trying to do it in a very sophisticated fashion,\" Buchanan says. \"This is the language of four-star hotels and first-class air travel, not budget hotels - except for the price.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
