September 10). All of us involved in the family planning and abortion law reform movement have known for years that it is chiefly fear of offending the Vatican that has inhibited rational discussion of global warming, to say nothing of rational discussion of the health and welfare of women. It is tragic, as Bunting observes, that this has left the territory to the British National party. We turn our TV sets off, drive a little less, insulate our roofs, use dimmer lights etc, knowing how largely irrelevant these well-meaning activities are in the face of the rising tide of population. We need to explain the dangers of rising population to our children during sex education lessons; we need to regain the missionary zeal about birth control that our grandmothers had; we need to make early, safe abortion facilities easily available. Jonathon Porritt is quite wrong to say this is \"tough territory\". The public is converted; it is our leaders of opinion and politicians who need to start thinking hard and have the guts to speak out. Madeleine Simms London We at the Optimum Population Trust were heartened that Madeleine Bunting supported our patron Jonathon Porritt's call for the UK to have \"a population policy that covers both family planning and immigration, aimed at long-term population decline\". For years OPT has been the only green organisation to speak openly on the issue of population growth and its impact on the environment, globally and in the UK. We've done this by explaining the facts and figures, as rational liberals with sympathy for all those in all countries who have tried to put population policies on the political agenda. Emotionally charged sensitivities and an understandable fear of giving offence have been among the reasons why it has taken so long to win acceptance for commonsense proposals. So we are shocked that Bunting implies that OPT is \"unsavoury company\" and that she, perhaps inadvertently, has linked our aims to those of the BNP. We do not support the BNP and oppose any form of racism. But is it surprising that the BNP has monopolised this issue in the political arena if commentators smear moderate organisations such as ours by linking us with the extremists that we utterly oppose? Our website is at www.optimumpopulation.org where we hope Guardian readers can make up their own minds about OPT and the issues we have for so long been asking our political representatives to consider. Rosamund McDougall Optimum Population Trust Population increase in this country is largely a product of immigration, and much of that is economic, from developed economies and not directly connected with the much greater problem of world population growth. Madeleine Bunting rightly points out the inadequate response of environmental NGOs. They seem not to realise that every extra person demands food, water, energy and transport. In the third world these demands are partly achieved by the destruction of the surrounding environment. The NGOs also seem to believe that all those presently now producing minute carbon footprints will be happy to continue at that level of consumption. The underlying tragic truth is that we know how to stabilise population: the right mix of education, appropriate persuasion, readily available contraception and a serious attempt to alleviate poverty could work; self-interest alone demands that the rich developed world provides appropriate funding. There is, one encouraging fact: Italy, home of the Vatican, which argues for unlimited population growth, has one of the lowest birth rates in the world. Geoff Hearnden Exeter Madeleine Bunting is right that environmentalism only makes sense if there is population control as well - but that just shows that the implicit meaning of green politics is hostility to the mass of ordinary people. If environmentalists find that the British National party cap fits, they should wear it. Happily, the greens are wrong. People are not a burden on the country's resources, but the means to make it a better place. James Heartfield London"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
