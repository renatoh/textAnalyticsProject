A panel was questioning him and fellow researchers as officials sealed off offices and secured materials in their laboratories. On Friday Prof Hwang acknowledged \"fatal errors\" in a May article in the US journal Science, which purported to show how his team created custom-made embryonic stem cells for 11 patients. Prof Hwang admitted there were only eight stem cell lines when he submitted the paper, but that his team later created three more."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
