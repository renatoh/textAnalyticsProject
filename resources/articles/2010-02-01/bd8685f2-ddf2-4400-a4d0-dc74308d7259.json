It was desperately hard on the Scots, who had played the cleverer rugby for the first hour, and the noise generated by the crowd when Shane Williams dived over for the winning try could not have been louder had Wales won a grand slam and World Cup rolled into one. It was a roar more of relief than of celebration. Wales had played some gormless rugby before gaining a numerical advantage and would have found themselves down and out had not Sean Lamont slipped a forward pass to Kelly Brown three minutes into the second period. The flanker was away for a try that would have put his side 28-9 ahead, but he was called back and the momentum slowly shifted away from Scotland. They were unfortunate to lose two players through injury in the opening half: Thom Evans was taken to hospital with a serious back injury after being tackled by Lee Byrne while Chris Paterson, on the day of his 100th cap, went for a check-up after leaving with what was described as an abdominal problem. By the end of the game Scotland had almost run out of outside backs: Rory Lamont had limped off with ankle trouble, the outside-half Dan Parks had been replaced by a flanker and Phil Godman was in the sin-bin. Scotland looked in little danger with 10 minutes to go. They led 24-14 and had been in front since the ninth minute when the flanker John Barclay slipped through tackles by James Hook and Gareth Cooper for a ludicrously simple try after Parks had fooled Wales by dummying a kick on halfway and instead passing infield to John Beattie. Wales were attacking with increasing desperation when the hooker Scott Lawson scragged Richie Rees at a Wales ruck on the halfway line. The ball had already been slowed down, the Scotland defence was hardly in any danger and the referee George Clancy had warned them after multiple infringements at the breakdown and in the scrum. He did not hesitate in showing a yellow card when Lawson infringed and Wales started attacking with more purpose. Within three minutes of Lawson's departure, they were back to within three points: Shane Williams came into midfield from his wing and created the space for Leigh Halfpenny to score close to the posts. Two minutes remained on the clock. Mike Blair intercepted a Stephen Jones pass, more shades of last week, but immediately gave the ball away. James Roberts made a dent in the midfield and Byrne chipped into the Scotland 22: as he hacked the ball on, he was taken out by Godman with what the referee deemed, to Scotland's fury, to be a trip and the visitors were down to 13 men. Wales had a penalty and a decision to make: by the time a kick was taken, time would virtually be up. The kick was 10 metres from Scotland's line. Wales would have had a two-man advantage in a scrum, but Clancy had struggled in the set piece all afternoon. Ryan Jones opted for the three points and a draw, having been told there would be 10 seconds left after the restart. The Scotland coach, Andy Robinson, tried to get a message to his players that the restart should be kicked out on the full because time was up, but it emerged afterwards that Wales may have been awarded a scrum on halfway had the kick-off been deliberately booted dead. It was immaterial because Blair, in the absence of Parks and Godman, kept the ball in play. Wales moved it right where Scotland had a flanker, Alan MacDonald, on the wing. Stephen Jones chipped into space and, as the ball bounced away from Sean Lamont and Halfpenny, it fell into Byrne's arms. Three phases later, Wales had three men over and Williams, celebrating already, darted through two tired forwards. It was the only time Wales had been ahead and, if the result was reward for perseverance, Scotland were robbed of their first away victory in the tournament for four years. Wales talked before the match about a contrast in styles, dare against dour, but Scotland were enterprising from the off. The maligned Parks showed he was more than a kicker, varying his game cleverly and inspiring his side's two first-half tries: keeping the ball alive when Wales expected to kick it for the first and chipping to the line for Max Evans to outpace Halfpenny to the bounce. Scotland dominated the breakdown, generating quick ball and slowing Wales's down, while they regularly made dents in the midfield. Parks took over the goal-kicking when Paterson, whose run of consecutive successful goal-kicks in international tournament rugby ended on 52 when he missed the conversion after Evans's try, and landed two penalties to supplement two drop goals. Wales trailed 18-9 at the break, sustained by three Stephen Jones penalties, and they were undermined by basic errors. They took off the ineffective scrum-half Gareth Cooper at the interval and could have parked a few more in the changing room. Byrne made it 24-14 with 24 minutes to go after Shane Williams had come into the midfield,, but Scotland looked in control until a combination of yellow cards and injuries took their toll. France and Mathieu Bastareaud are in Cardiff on 26 February and Wales, never mind the victory, are looking horribly vulnerable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
