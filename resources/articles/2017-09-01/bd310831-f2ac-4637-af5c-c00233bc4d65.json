Celtic have recent and wounding experience of a football superpower. In their first match of the Champions League last season, they were humbled 7-0 at Barcelona. PSG\u2019s heavy spending \u2013 Neymar and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 form part of world football\u2019s most expensive frontline \u2013 presents a similar challenge for Celtic 12 months on. \u201cThese are the games where you get the chance to write your story that can be heard worldwide,\u201d Celtic\u2019s manager said. \u201cIt\u2019s brilliant, it will be a really exciting night. With the level of players PSG have, it leaves a big focus on some of their outstanding individuals. It\u2019s great to be involved in it. In these types of games attitude is everything. You can\u2019t look too closely at them, or think too emotionally. They have to feel us breathing very close to them.\u201d Media representatives from the United States and Brazil will take in this tie, in an illustration of PSG\u2019s global appeal. \u201cPSG are put together to win this competition, there\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cThey\u2019ve brought in Neymar and Mbapp\u00e9 so their focus is clearly on winning it. But we have a courage to play and a courage physically to press and work. \u201cIf you stand off top-class players they\u2019ll show you why they\u2019re top class. This is a game to go and enjoy. Make no bones about it, this is a superior team to us. That\u2019s the reality of it with the quality of the players and where they\u2019re at. \u201cBut for us we take an attitude into the game. We\u2019re very much a team and have the ability to play in this type of game. We have speed, strength and power so it\u2019s a great chance to make a good start. It\u2019s going to be a big challenge but one we\u2019re determined to embrace.\u201d PSG\u2019s wealth, as bestowed on them from Qatar, raises constant questions regarding financial rules within football. Rodgers is unfazed by such matters. \u201cI tend not to go into it too much or overthink it too much. There are people there to govern the game. There are people there to decide the laws and regulations and what you can and can\u2019t do. If they were able to do it [sign Neymar and Mbapp\u00e9] then they\u2019ve done it and fair play to them.\u201d Rodgers disputes any suggestion of PSG\u2019s visit representing a free hit for Celtic. \u201cWe are clear the world will look at the game and everyone will expect us to lose,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for our players, our own cause is different. We fought so hard to get into the competition, so we can go on and make progress. Home games can be very important. We are facing a huge opponent but we are excited by it. We won\u2019t be overawed by it.\u201d Mbapp\u00e9, whom Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has compared with Pel\u00e9, scored on his PSG debut as Metz were demolished 5-1 on Friday evening. Rodgers drew another parallel: \u201cWhen you see his speed, movement and quality he looked last year like Thierry Henry in his pomp. \u201cThat was the big comparison I made. I thought it was as close to Henry as you could get \u2013 he peels to the left side, chops back in. He has speed, can shoot and linked up well in a two or can play on his own. He\u2019s a huge talent so for any club with the money to invest then it\u2019s a no lose situation. He looks an amazing player.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
