The former Brexit secretary\u2019s comments come amid revelations of a secret senior cabinet minister plan to forward Johnson\u2019s name alone to the confirmatory vote in July. The six remaining candidates in the leadership race appeared before a hustings on Saturday organised by the National Conservative Convention. Johnson refused to take questions from journalists as he arrived at the hustings, unlike his fellow contenders Rory Stewart and Sajid Javid, who both gave brief interviews. Ealier, Raab, currently fourth in the race to succeed Theresa May, criticised the former foreign secretary\u2019s reluctance to appear on television debates and questioned his \u201cmettle\u201d to be prime minister. Despite polling 27 votes against Johnson\u2019s 114 in Thursday\u2019s first ballot of Tory MPs, Raab insisted the competition had \u201cnot even started yet\u201d. \u201cWhen you campaign in marginal seats, who can reach out and unite the working-class vote and the middle-class vote?\u201d Raab said to the Daily Telegraph. \u201cAre we going to be in a better position to do that with a candidate who isn\u2019t so easily caricatured as being from the privileged elite, with the son of a refugee, a grammar school boy who is offering tax cuts to most of those people on \u00a315,000 as opposed to people on \u00a350,000 and above?\u201d Johnson will be represented by an empty podium during a Channel 4 television debate on Sunday night, after he declined an invitation to battle it out with his rivals because he feared it would be \u201ccacophonous\u201d. Under growing pressure to submit to greater public scrutiny, Johnson has said he will take part in a similar event hosted by the BBC next Tuesday. The programme, hosted by Emily Maitlis, does not include a studio audience and will instead see the candidates answering pre-submitted questions from viewers. \u201cEveryone is going to have to demonstrate that they have not just the vision but the nerve and mettle to deal with the EU and with a minority government,\u201d Raab told the Daily Telegraph. \u201cIf you can\u2019t take the heat of the TV studios what chance of taking the heat of the negotiating chamber in Brussels?\u201d Following reports that a plan had been hatched among senior cabinet ministers to forward only Johnson\u2019s name in the final ballot of members next month, Rory Stewart, another contender in the Tory leadership race, tweeted: \u201cPlease write to your MP if you think this is not a good idea\u201d. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Saturday, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, said she feared we were entering an \u201cimpasse\u201d on Brexit and the next leader of the Tory party would \u201cgive us no deal\u201d. \u201cWe simply cannot have no deal without there being a referendum on it, and with the option of remain,\u201d she added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
