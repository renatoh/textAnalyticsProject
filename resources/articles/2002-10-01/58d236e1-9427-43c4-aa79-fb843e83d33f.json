They say the government's pledge to widen participation is causing the \"politicisation\" of the selection of candidates. In a joint statement, four independent school heads' associations and the Secondary Heads Association said that the university admissions process should become more transparent. While voicing their support for widening participation - the government's pledge to get more students from \"non-traditional\" backgrounds into universities - they said it muddied the criteria by which students are assessed when they apply to university. The statement read: \"There is widespread confusion about the weight given in university admissions to considerations of socio-economic background, postcode and type of school attended. This confusion appears to extend to the universities themselves. It is not even clear what evidence is used to determine these factors.\" It continued: \"We consider it essential that in the current review of funding by HEFCE, the government should make it absolutely clear how it believes these factors should be assessed and implemented.\" Dick Davison, joint director of the Independent Schools Council Information Service, said he thought it was \"significant\" that the statement was a joint venture between state and independent schools. \"There are concerns in all schools about the lack of clarity and transparency in the whole admissions services at the moment. We have come together to demand that those concerns are addressed. \"There are a number of factors that we know are being taken into account - the postcode premium, the type of school attended, socio-economic data, but how are they measured and how much weight are they given? Factors other than A-level grades are taken into account. That is ok, as long as the degree to which non-academic factors are taken into account is known and understood,\" he said. But Geoff Parks, chair of Cambridge's admissions forum said although they considered an applicant's background, the final decision always came down to academic ability. \"Put simplistically 10 A stars from an independent school isn't as impressive as 10 A stars from a state school where average grades are five Cs. That's an extreme example, but we do take that into account. We are committed to getting the most able students in the country, and the ones best suited to our courses into the university,\" he said. Mr Parks added that he did not know of any complaints about the assessment criteria. Today's attack from the independent heads is more measured than previous criticisms. At the beginning of the month they criticised the system which they claimed favoured state school pupils over independent school pupils regardless of academic ability. They also voiced fears that cash premiums for students from certain areas could serve as an incentive. Representatives of the heads' associations are to seek a meeting with Margaret Hodge MP, the minister responsible for higher education to discuss the matter further. The independent schools were represented by the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, the Girls' Schools Association, the Society of Heads of Independent Schools and the Independent Schools Association."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
