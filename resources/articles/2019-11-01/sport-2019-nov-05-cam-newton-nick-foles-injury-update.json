The Panthers are 5-1 since then with Kyle Allen at quarterback. The official diagnosis was a Lisfranc injury to the left foot, and surgery had not been recommended for Newton as of this past weekend, according to multiple reports. Newton, the first overall selection in the 2011 NFL Draft out of Auburn, threw for 572 yards with no touchdowns and one interception in his two games this season. He has passed for 29,041 yards in his nine-year career with 182 touchdowns and 108 interceptions. The three-time Pro Bowl selection was named an NFL First-Team All-Pro in 2015, his Most Valuable Player season. Elsewhere, Nick Foles will return as the Jacksonville Jaguars starting quarterback following their bye week, coach Doug Marrone said Tuesday. Foles has been out since suffering a broken left collarbone in the season opener, undergoing surgery to install a plate and screws. He will return on 17 November when the Jaguars play at the Indianapolis Colts in Week 11. \u201cNick will be our starting quarterback going forward,\u201d Marrone said at a press conference. Foles\u2019 replacement, rookie Gardner Minshew II, played well enough that Foles\u2019 return to the starting lineup wasn\u2019t a given. Marrone informed the quarterbacks and then the rest of the team Tuesday morning. \u201cIt was obviously my decision,\u201d Marrone said. \u201cWorked hard on it.\u201d Minshew, a sixth-round pick out of Washington State, has guided the Jaguars to a 4-5 record, completing 61.2% of his passes for 2,285 yards, with 13 touchdowns and four interceptions. He didn\u2019t leave a positive impression on Sunday, though, committing four turnovers \u2013 including two interceptions \u2013 in a 26-3 loss to the Houston Texans in London. In his brief appearance in Week 1, Foles, the MVP of Super Bowl LII with the Philadelphia Eagles, was 5-of-8 passing for 75 yards with a touchdown."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
