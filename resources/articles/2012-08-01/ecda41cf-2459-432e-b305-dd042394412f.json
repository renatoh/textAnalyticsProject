Over the weekend you can take part yourself and try to beat the bog snorkelling world record or simply enjoy the bog snorkelling triathlon, which combines running, cycling and, yes, bog snorkelling. Other events include mountain bike bog snorkelling, which involves a lead-filled bicycle. Those who don't like bogs can take part in the wife-carrying contest, which is also happening in Llanwrtyd Wells.

Secret location in east London, Wed to 5 Oct, gingerline.co.uk Colette Bernhardt Notting Hill Carnival, London Often summer's last hurrah in the capital, William Hague's favourite street festival is soaked in history, from the solidarity of a community under attack to the annual photo of a policeman dancing with a Jamaican auntie. Celebration is the real story here, though, and it is worth dipping into just to marvel at the sheer effort that goes into the dancers' outfits. Music is, of course, central to the event, as sound systems battle to produce the best and the loudest sounds. Seek out the Tighten Up crew on the Gladdy Wax sound system for some old-school Notting Hill sounds.
