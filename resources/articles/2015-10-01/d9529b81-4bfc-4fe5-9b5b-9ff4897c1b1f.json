For a while this was in danger of turning into something of an anti-climax as Wales, 72 hours after securing their place in France, huffed and puffed without success against an Andorra side who had lost their previous 53 competitive matches and spent the day of the game strolling around a Sports Direct shop. The opening goal finally arrived, however, in the 51st minute when Aaron Ramsey was perfectly placed to sweep home a close-range, left-footed shot. From that point any concerns that Andorra \u2013 who are ranked 205th in the world \u2013 might dare to dampen the mood in the Welsh capital disappeared. Gareth Bale, the inspiration and driving force behind this resurgent team, fittingly added the second with his 19th international goal to draw level with Craig Bellamy as the fifth-highest Wales scorer of all time. By that stage the home supporters had gone through their full repertoire of songs over and over again \u2013 brace yourself, France, because it is a lengthy list \u2013 and there was also a stirring rendition of Land of My Fathers. In truth the singing, which started with Super Furry Animals performing on the pitch beforehand, was better than the football for long periods. Not that the scoreline, or the performance, was particularly important on an evening when the home fans were more interested in acknowledging the achievements of the manager and players. The last time Wales qualified for a major tournament was in 1958 when Cliff Jones, Ivor Allchurch and John Charles took Wales to the quarter-finals of the World Cup. Few would have predicted that the current generation were going to write their names into the history books when they fell behind to Andorra in the opening game of this campaign. Thirteen months on Coleman and his players were walking out on a red carpet after beating the same opponents. The stage was set in more ways than one after the final whistle as the Wales players were introduced to a sell-out crowd one by one. Coleman followed them to the centre of the pitch where champagne corks popped and the Zombie Nation soundtrack that has turned into a cult anthem for the Wales fans blasted out. \u201cThe support has been incredible,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it playing and managing Wales. I\u2019m so happy for them.\u201d Bale, without question, is the star turn. He has scored seven of his team\u2019s 11 qualification goals and the fact that he was still on the pitch at the end here, completing 90 minutes twice in the space of four days after only recently recovering from a calf injury, says everything about his commitment to his country. \u201cGareth\u2019s a world-beater,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just his goals, it\u2019s everything \u2013 his whole manner when he\u2019s wearing a Welsh jersey; he loves it. He\u2019s always part of the group and puts the team first.\u201d For Coleman and his players, the focus now turns to one, possibly two, international friendlies next month followed by December\u2019s eagerly awaited draw for Euro 2016. Coleman used the word \u201cfearless\u201d to describe his players\u2019 approach to the finals although he did admit he would prefer not to face one of the home nations. While Wales proved in this campaign they are difficult to beat, this was another occasion that highlighted how breaking down opponents content to set deep does not come easily to a team that likes to play on the counter-attack. Andorra, though, were finally breached when Ramsey converted from six yards and it was then left to Bale, with a shot that he almost scuffed into the corner, to finish off a memorable campaign. \u201cThey\u2019re broken down the barriers and they will be remembered now in history,\u201d Coleman said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
