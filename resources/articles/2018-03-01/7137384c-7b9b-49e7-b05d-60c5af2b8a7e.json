The Tottenham manager knows the FA Cup represents his only chance of a trophy this season and his team play at Swansea City in the quarter-finals on Saturday. Pochettino wants to win but, even if Tottenham were to claim the trophy, which would be his first as a manager, he would not consider it a decisive step in what he is building at the club. Pochettino won the Copa del Rey twice as a player with Espanyol and he says it \u201cchanged nothing\u201d for him. He insists that only winning the Premier League or the Champions League would make a material difference to the mentality of his players. \u201cWhen you win a real tournament, when you need to play under pressure and perform at your best over 10 months \u2013 that is the moment when you start to learn about winning,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201c Winning a cup is going to help but to create that winning culture you need to work a lot and take many steps. It is not: \u2018Oh, I am going to create a winning culture in two months [at the business end of a cup run].\u2019\u201d Pochettino\u2019s Copa del Rey successes were celebrated but he says they were underpinned by intangibles such as the draw, form and other of-the-moment circumstances. \u201cWe were very lucky,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we didn\u2019t deserve to win. I am in the history of Espanyol because we won but I don\u2019t feel it made a massive change [to the club]. It changed nothing for me, personally. Nothing. Sometimes success doesn\u2019t help you to be better. \u201cSometimes you win because the draw is kind and maybe it makes you play a team that is focusing on the Champions League. The form of the players that you are going to face is another factor. I don\u2019t know if who wins titles like the FA Cup or the League Cup is the best team. The Premier League is the truest test because you need the whole squad and the competition is 38 games over 10 months.\u201d Pochettino even included the World Cup in his comparison. He played for a highly rated Argentina team at the 2002 finals but they were eliminated at the group phase having arrived out of form. \u201cIt\u2019s like the League Cup, Copa del Rey, FA Cup \u2013 they are very short periods and, sometimes, it\u2019s a coincidence; maybe you have some players not in good form,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cThere are competitions that if you win, fantastic, but if you don\u2019t win, nothing changes.\u201d To Pochettino, the process and the stability of what has been built is all important. \u201cLeicester winning the league was a fantastic story but the moment you lift the trophy and then put it down, that disappears,\u201d the Spurs manager said. \u201cYou need to be ready for the next challenge. If not, all that happiness will transform into sadness.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
