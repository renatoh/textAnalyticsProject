According to Mr Weingarten, of Washington DC, chief executives cannot be expected to understand numbers (the obvious exception being the number of zeros on their pay slips). \"Accounting decisions are arcane,\" he said. \"They're mysterious for people who are not trained in the science.\" Chief executives, he went on, rely on employees in the finance department and audits undertaken by professional accountants. Therefore, he concludes: \"People who rely on competent professionals shouldn't be prosecuted. People who make inadvertent mistakes shouldn't be prosecuted,\" and \"people who preside in a titular way over large companies in which there are mistakes made shouldn't be prosecuted.\" The US criminal justice system, he maintains, \"should only include people who do the traditional things that are wrong: lying, cheating and stealing\". In Mr Weingarten's world, then, a chief executive has power without responsibility. They are paid huge sums, which can be multiplied when things go right, but they should very rarely have to carry the can when things go wrong. Moreover, if something does go seriously adrift on their watch, it will almost always be the fault of someone else - because you cannot expect the boss to have any idea that something might be amiss. It will come as no surprise to learn that Mr Weingarten is lawyer to Bernie Ebbers, the former WorldCom chief executive, who presided over the world's biggest suspected corporate fraud. The good lawyer, incidentally, also has the former chief accounting officer of Enron and the former chief counsel to Tyco on his client list. Mr Weingarten outlined his vision of chief executive heaven just as WorldCom disclosed another $3.3bn of accounting errors, on top of the $4.5bn the company originally estimated. At the same time the now bankrupt WorldCom said it might write off $51bn of goodwill - more than the national income of New Zealand and the biggest write-off of all time after AOL Time Warner's $54bn. It is also going to re-evaluate the value of its plant, property and equipment, and no prizes for guessing which direction the re-evaluation is likely to take. So just what could be the explanation behind the glut of US accounting scandals? Greed? Feelings of invincibility? Deception? Mr Weingarten concedes there are \"clearly a few bad apples out there\", but he lays the blame on lax accounting rules. Shareholders will undoubtedly be pleased to hear that their mammoth losses are just down to a little misunderstanding. Bonanza for sloth \"There's nothing better for the economy than a good war,\" goes the adage. After depressing economic data for June, analysts are beginning to mutter: \"There's nothing worse for the economy than a golden jubilee.\" With the world cup just getting underway, even the staunchest Republicans had to agree that the Queen had done us all a favour by providing an excuse for an extra bank holiday to soak up the fun. Yesterday's trade figures suggested we enjoyed ourselves a bit too much. Retailers have reported a slump in sales when football or royal festivities intervened and earlier in the week official data showed that industrial production went through the floor as workers took time off in jubilee week, or huddled around the telly to catch a match. We now discover exports also collapsed, stretching the deficit on goods and services to its widest since trade ground to a halt after September 11. When July's figures emerge, economists will have a better idea of how much of June's bad news was a blip caused by the jubilee/world cup bonanza. But even if output and exports recover, the Queen and David Beckham between them seem to have pushed back economic recovery a month or two. Daft draft Yesterday the European commission unveiled the latest draft of its prospectus directive, which would allow companies seeking to tap investors' pockets to issue a single document for all EU markets. Without such measures the EU will remain way short of its goal of a single market in financial services. But as usual, the devil is in the detail. Some critics reckon the proposals give national regulators too much scope for retaining a monopoly on approvals rather than allowing issuers to choose their venue and then use that go-ahead as a passport to the pan-European markets. Others believe that the proposals outlined would be too light a touch on the regulatory tiller and that, coupled with other directives on market abuse and reporting, they could leave investors dangerously exposed. The UK is among those most concerned. City institutions are lobbying Brussels, and the Treasury is said to be considering legislation to prevent the erosion of governance protections. But that would be cumbersome, time consuming and potentially expensive. Far better if the UK can persuade Brussels that a single market is only worth having if investors have confidence in it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
