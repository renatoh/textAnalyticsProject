These include joint roles and responsibilities, financial accounting and transparency, and communication. \"It is the exact opposite of a rap on the knuckles for anybody,\" said Ian Drake, the chief executive of British Cycling. Questions have been asked about the dual roles of staff such as Dave Brailsford, team principal at Sky and performance director of British Cycling. Liz Nicholl, the chief executive of UK Sport, said this area needed attention. \"When you have dual roles serving two objectives it's important to make sure that allocation of time is managed. It's not something that just happens. We have to make sure from our perspective that World Class Performance [its programme to give the best athletes the best chance of fulfilling their potential] has sufficient resources at all times, there needs to be control around that. There needs to be a transparent system in place.\" Drake said that, as Team Sky had evolved since its foundation, the overlap of roles and responsibilities with British Cycling had become less. The report, jointly commissioned by UK Sport and British Cycling to examine the way Team Sky and the British Olympic team worked together, was distilled into a page and a half because, Nicholl said: \"There was sensitivity about sharing information that could give rivals insights into how the programme is operated and managed.\" The key recommendations were the appointment of a finance director at British Cycling and the creation of an operational document to ensure roles and responsibilities were monitored and managed \"from a resource and financial perspective\". The document will be created by British Cycling and reviewed quarterly. Both Drake and Nicholl denied that the financial recommendations pointed to any irregularities. \"It's not that anything has gone wrong but it's about what structures we have in place to manage a huge amount of public investment,\" said Drake. \"The biggest challenge with Sky was that there were other things going on, pressure on both ends, funding doubled from \u00a312M to \u00a324M and expansion by about 100 staff. We are audited heavily and there are no concerns there but you can't stand still.\" The report also recommended that UK Sport should continue to work closely with British Cycling to identify any new risks or opportunities. Nicholl said this would not include a place for UK Sport on the board of Tour Racing Limited, the company which owns Team Sky and holds the squad's ProTour licence. \"There is a line over which we would never step, we can't get involved in decision-making within the team because then we would be unable to hold the sport to account. We have to stay on one side of that line.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
