Having overcome mechanical problems to finish Sunday's Tour of Flanders, Cavendish said he remains on track for the Tour de France but his relationship with his team's other sprinter, Greipel, is another matter. Cavendish told the Guardian that riding in the same team as Greipel \"is not a problem for me, because I'm a better rider\", but added, in response to the German's suggestion that he could ride alongside Cavendish at the Tour de France, that \"there's no chance whatsoever that he's coming to a bike race that I'm in\". When HTC-Columbia confirmed last week that Cavendish will start next month's Tour of California instead of the Giro d'Italia, the 24-year-old Isle of Man rider hinted at unrest, telling Cyclingnews.com: \"I didn't make the choice [to ride California]. I love Italy, I love the Giro but I'm paid to do this now, so I have to do it.\" Greipel, who has five wins this season and was critical of Cavendish after he failed to defend his Milan-San Remo title at the end of March, will instead be the team's designated sprinter at the Giro. Greipel wants to ride the Tour de France but Cavendish dismissed any chance of the two of them teaming up, saying: \"Me on bad form is still better than him. \"I was pretty pissed with Greipel's comments after Sanremo,\" he said. \"If he thought he could win, he'd say it before the race rather than when he's looking at the results sheet. It wasn't through lack of form that I didn't win San Remo - it was bad luck. Last year I won it picking my nose. This year it was possible I'd win again. There's no chance of Greipel winning a 'monument'.\" Cavendish crashed twice during the first of the five \"monuments\", Milan-San Remo, and suffered more bad luck on Sunday, falling and damaging his bike. \"That wrecked my race. My condition is coming back, definitely. I'm going better now than I imagined I would be back in January,\" he said. Cavendish had dental surgery over the winter, with a subsequent infection curtailing his training. He then withdrew from the Tour of Catalonia with flu, though not before registering his first win of the season, on stage two. This time last year he had eight wins, though his targets for this year, to win the green jersey at the Tour de France and world championship road race, come later in the season. \"If I wanted to just win races I wouldn't ride every ProTour race,\" said Cavendish. \"I understand that at the moment I'm racing to be in my best form for the Tour de France and the world championships. If I wanted to get shit small wins, I'd race shit small races.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
