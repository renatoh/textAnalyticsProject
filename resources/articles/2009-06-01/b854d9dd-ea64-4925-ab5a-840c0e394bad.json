Most schools have left subject teachers to interpret it as they saw fit, which has led to an incoherent \"whole-school curriculum\". Ofsted inspectors visited 37 schools between May 2008 and March this year to see how well they had implemented the changes. Only four schools were judged to have done so \"outstandingly\", 21 were deemed \"good\", eight \"satisfactory\" and one \"inadequate\". The successful ones had developed a coherent curriculum throughout the school which was led and monitored by senior staff, the study found. But most schools left subject leaders to interpret the changes themselves. This often meant introducing special days or courses covering parts of the curriculum only, rather than linking these to the rest of the curriculum, thus \"limiting their usefulness\". Some subject departments were fully prepared, while others had made only minor modifications, Ofsted said. The new, less prescriptive, curriculum for 11- to 14-year-olds was introduced last September. It was designed to give teachers greater flexibility in the way they teach, to meet pupils' needs and to focus on key skills to help them become \"successful, confident and responsible\" later in life. Developing personal, learning and thinking skills, as well as teamwork, creative thinking and self-management, is crucial to the new curriculum. In good schools these skills underpinned the whole curriculum, but most \"had little or no knowledge of where the skills were being taught\", inspectors said. In almost all schools there was evidence that the new curriculum was having a positive impact on students' progress in lessons and their enjoyment of learning, but it was too early to see any significant impact on standards, Ofsted said. Functional skills in English, mathematics and ICT were usually well planned and taught, but inspectors saw little integration of them across schools. \"Only three of the schools visited included functional skills outside the core subjects of English, mathematics and ICT in an effective way,\" the report concluded. All the schools made clear links between the curriculum at key stage 3 (age 11-14) and the rest of the secondary curriculum, but few used primary teachers' assessments to help them devise appropriate lessons for new secondary pupils. Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said this proved that primary Sats (standard assessment tasks) were of limited use for secondary teachers. \"Test results at key stage 2 are so narrow in describing pupil attainment it only gives secondary schools partial information at best,\" she said. Christine Gilbert, the chief inspector of schools, said: \"It is still early days for the new key stage 3 curriculum, but our inspectors found a generally optimistic picture, with both teachers and pupils positive about the changes.\" \"Now the task is to ensure that this positive approach in lessons translates into improving standards for pupils in all schools.\" School leaders said schools had struggled to cope with the amount of curriculum changes. John Dunford, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"Schools have faced massive challenges in changing the KS3, GCSE and A-level curriculum, at the same time as introducing diplomas. There has been too much curriculum change simultaneously. It has been impossible to do it outstandingly all at once.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
