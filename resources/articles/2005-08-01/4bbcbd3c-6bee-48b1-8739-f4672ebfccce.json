No one really believes that Tony Blair is considering packing everything in at 52. And while the Institute of Public Policy Research's recent report suggesting the retirement age should be raised from 65 to 67 drew a sharp intake of breath in some quarters, it met with a cheer among many of the country's 50-plus population. Not everyone is counting the days until they don't need to set the alarm clock any more. At the B&amp;Q hardware store in Wimbledon, west London, is a man who is living proof that you don't necessarily need to pack it all in in your 60s. Sid Prior, resplendent in his orange pinny, is reporting for his shift as a shop floor sales adviser and, as usual, there's a small queue of customers lined up waiting to ask his advice. Prior puts his popularity with the punters down to \"looking as though I probably know what I'm talking about\". He's certainly not some fresh-faced whippersnapper straight out of school. Ask the punters how old they think Prior is and some will hazard a guess at, oh, 70. A few, eagle-eyed, think he might be pushing 75. In fact, the customers are well wide of the mark. Prior isn't merely old enough to be the grandfather of his younger colleagues, he could easily be their great-grandfather. In three months' time, he'll be blowing out the candles on his 91st birthday cake. And he still works 31 hours a week. What on earth is he doing, leaving home at 6am five mornings a week to drag himself into work (8am to 1pm on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, and all day on Wednesday and Friday) when he could be pottering around the park, reading the paper or having lunch with his mates in the local boozer? How did retirement pass him by, I wonder - and does he ever plan to hang up his pinny and put his feet up in his flat in Fulham? He chuckles. \"I couldn't stand retirement,\" he says. \"I tried it once, for three weeks, when I was 74. I was lost, completely lost. I'm an early riser [he gets up at 4am], so I'd do a few chores around the flat, then go to the supermarket. And it would be 9am, and I'd be there thinking: what do I do with the rest of the day? It was no sort of life.\" So Prior, who already had a long career as a salesman behind him, scoured the local paper for job ads, and saw that they were looking for someone at B&amp;Q. \"I rang them up and spoke to the manager. And he said that I was exactly the man they were looking for - I couldn't believe my luck.\" The job, Prior discovered, involved going round the store on a six-week cycle, checking the prices of every one of the 25,000 or so articles. \"All the young people they'd interviewed said it was too boring. But it didn't sound boring to me, not compared with sitting at home doing nothing.\" From day one, Prior realised he loved the contact with customers. \"I found people were singling me out among the staff to ask questions. One woman came over to me and she said - I'll always remember this - 'I want you to answer this, you look as though you know everything.'\" After three years stock-checking, he was promoted to the garden centre, and for the past four years he's been a customer adviser on the shop floor. Prior sounds like exactly the sort of chap who'd be behind plans to raise the retirement age. Not a bit of it. While he's proud to have carried on working through his 60s, 70s and 80s and fervently hopes to see out his 90s the same way, he doesn't believe anyone should be pushed into working if they'd rather not. \"Not everyone is like me - a lot of people relish the thought of being able to play golf and see more of their grandchildren. But in my case I'm not a golfer and, as I've never married, there are no grandchildren. Work is the thing I enjoy, so why give it up?\" He knows there is ageism in the workplace, but thinks there are lots of oldies like him who'd love the chance of a job. It's the contact with younger people, the mental stimulation and the reason for getting up in the morning that make work so attractive in later life, he says. \"And for as many people as think I'm mad, there are plenty who envy me to bits.\" A potted history of Prior's working life is a first-person tour of the 20th century. He was born in London in the year the first world war broke out, 1914; his first taste of a workplace came at an unusually early age: his mother placed him in a munitions factory creche while she toiled away for the war effort. He says that like most Londoners he's felt a bit jittery on the tube recently, but it's extraordinary to think that his first experience of violence in the metropolis would have been the Zeppelin raids. After the war, his father became a butler to an aristocratic family, so Prior is also a direct link to another working experience of yesteryear. (He was thrilled, he says, with the film Gosford Park, which portrayed life below stairs exactly as he remembers it.) His father's titled employers were \"wonderful people\", although he does admit to having become slightly more leftwing in his later years. \"I've always voted Conservative, but recently I have started thinking about the Empire, about how much income there must have been from all that wealth - and about how little the ordinary people, like my parents, seemed to benefit from it,\" he says. \"I remember how my dad worked all hours - he'd be on duty from 7.30am until 10pm every day. His only time off was a half-day each Saturday, and another every other Sunday.\" Prior left school at 14 for an office job in Westminster, and remembers standing in the street one day in 1928 to watch Field Marshall Earl Haig's funeral procession. During the second world war he was in the army and fought in North Africa; when he was demobbed he returned to his old office and was promoted to salesman. \"They sent me to Manchester for nine months' training,\" he remembers. \"Imagine that! These days people apply for a job one minute, and they're doing it the next. In those days training meant getting to know every job in the industry, so you really knew what you were talking about.\" Back in London, he spent the next 25 years selling abrasive equipment, ending up as a sales manager with a team of 18. When 65 loomed, he took a new job working for a nephew who ran a greengrocer's in Covent Garden; it was the nephew's move to Spain that threw him into his brief spell of retirement at 74. Ninety now, he hardly ever takes a sickie, which he puts down to his daily habit, stretching back 60 years, of taking garlic, yeast and cod liver oil tablets. He has five weeks holiday a year and spends two weeks in Ireland and another in Spain, but he's never tempted to prolong the break. \"I enjoy being somewhere different,\" he says. \"But when the holiday's over, I'm always ready to get back to work.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
