Rise, which will be published in August 2018, has just been sold at auction to the independent publisher Canongate. Miller, who became a public figure when she successfully challenged the UK government over its authority to trigger article 50 without parliamentary approval, will write the book with the novelist and journalist Elizabeth Day. Miller, who spoke out earlier this month about how threats of acid attacks had made her afraid to leave her home, said: \u201cI have become the person I am today, as a result of both the successes and the scars in my life. A life in which I have rarely backed down and whose lessons I hope to share within this book. I very much hope through my stories, readers are able to be happier with who they are and how they live their lives.\u201d The title draws from Angelou\u2019s poem Still I Rise, a battle cry from the late poet in which she describes herself as \u201cthe dream and the hope of the slave\u201d: \u201cYou may write me down in history / With your bitter, twisted lies, / You may trod me in the very dirt / But still, like dust, I\u2019ll rise.\u201d \u201cMaya Angelou\u2019s poem \u2013 its tone of defiance in the face of increasing hostility, hate and defamation \u2013 was definitely one source of inspiration for the book. The poem beautifully encapsulates what it is to be subject to abuse and to be unbowed by it: to answer it by continuing to rise. I\u2019d like to pay homage to a woman who has inspired me, and I deeply hope that my book might inspire others,\u201d said Miller. Canongate described Rise as \u201ca rallying cry, offering guidance and confidence to women in particular for making their voices heard, claiming their own stories, and finding strength in adversity.\u201d In addition to her work challenging Brexit, the publisher cited Miller\u2019s fight for \u201ctransparency and ethical conduct in the financial industry\u201d and how she has overcome \u201cconsiderable challenges in her personal life\u201d. After she and her first husband divorced, Miller was a single mother, bringing up her daughter alone for nine years. A second marriage to the financier Jon Maguire was troubled \u2013 she told the Guardian in May that \u201cthere was a point when I almost thought it wasn\u2019t worth living\u201d, and claims her husband was violent, although he denies this. Today, she is married to the hedge fund manager Alan Miller, whom she met in 2006. Miller has said that her fight for transparency in the City earned her the nickname \u201cthe black widow spider\u201d. Since she took on the government over Brexit, she has been the target of racist and sexist verbal abuse, as well as physical threats against herself and her family. Rhodri Phillips, the 4th Viscount St Davids, was jailed for 12 weeks after he wrote on Facebook that he would pay \u201c\u00a35,000 for the first person to \u2018accidentally\u2019 run over this bloody troublesome first generation immigrant\u201d. Miller was born in Guyana, and grew up in the UK, at first attending boarding school before her parents\u2019 financial situation changed and she became a day pupil, supplementing her allowance by working as a chambermaid. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that \u2018as a coloured woman\u2019, I\u2019m not even human, I\u2019m a primate and only a piece of meat and I should be hunted down and killed,\u201d she told the Guardian in January. \u201cI\u2019ve had somebody told me I needed to be \u2018the new Jo Cox\u2019. I\u2019ve had people say there only three positions a woman of colour can have, that is a prostitute, a cleaner or having babies.\u201d Canongate senior commissioning editor Hannah Knowles, who paid an undisclosed amount for the memoir, praised Miller\u2019s \u201cbravery, honesty, passion and fearless advocacy\u201d. \u201cWhat is even more remarkable is that she does not see herself as special in this regard. We are extremely honoured to be publishing such an important voice, and to be bringing Gina\u2019s hard-earned wisdom to a large readership,\u201d she said. Miller\u2019s agent, Nelle Andrew at PFD, approached Miller directly about writing a book, after watching the high court case. \u201cTo see a woman of her education and accomplishments take on the government was incredible but I was even more invested because she was also a woman of colour and as someone who is mixed race, I was horrified at the level of racist vitriol she received,\u201d said Andrew. \u201cFor me I didn\u2019t want a story on Brexit \u2013 I wanted a story about a woman who had this unshakeable belief in what she believed to be right and where that moral compass came from; where the strength to see that through in the face of such hate and abuse started? It was her resilience which drew me in and which continues to impress and inspire. When she opened up about the series of tragedies, obstacles and challenges she has overcome, the bottom line of all that was her resilience. Her core that would not let her lie down and accept defeat even at the worst moments of her life. It is a story in the current cultural climate that I think absolutely needs to be told.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
