Last Saturday the former prime minister watched on as his beloved stepson, the artist Louis Pratt, married the former SBS television reporter Brianna Roberts at an intimate outdoor wedding at Mount Wilson in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney. The ceremony was held in the Socrates Garden at Breenhold, where parts of The Great Gatsby film were filmed. The temperature was hovering around 13C but nothing could dampen Hawke\u2019s spirits. He sat in a wheelchair, rugged up in a blanket and puffer jacket, next to his wife, Blanche d\u2019Alpuget, in the front row. Despite the bitter cold Hawke\u2019s face was beaming with pride for the couple. At their engagement party a year earlier in Sydney, he spent the afternoon on his balcony talking to guests, a Hawke Lager in one hand and a cigar in the other. Later he was in a singsong mood, leading the party in rousing renditions of Waltzing Matilda and Solidarity Forever. On Saturday he was too unwell to attend the wedding reception but many Hawke Lagers were consumed in his honour. Days later, when the couple returned to Sydney, they re-enacted their first dance for Hawke. Roberts had put back on her bridal gown and Pratt wore his tuxedo. \u201cWe did the dance in the living room for him. We danced to a recording of my dad [Geoff] playing piano and singing True Love. It was the last time we saw him. He was happy, serene, almost nostalgic. A very sweet farewell,\u201d Roberts said. Pratt said his stepfather\u2019s legacy would live on indefinitely. \u201cHe fought for the Australian people because he loved them and, as old age wearied him, there was only sweetness left,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cHe loved fiercely and was a warrior to the end.\u201d Pratt said he had regarded Hawke as a friend because he had been brought up by his father, Tony. But he had loved Hawke like a father, too. The couple said Hawke\u2019s marital advice had been to enjoy themselves. \u201cHe was a true romantic,\u201d Roberts said. The couple are expected to cut their overseas honeymoon short to return to Sydney for Hawke\u2019s funeral."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
