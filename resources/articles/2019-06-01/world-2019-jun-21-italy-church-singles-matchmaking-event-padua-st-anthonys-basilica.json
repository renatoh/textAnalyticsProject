The friars at St Anthony\u2019s basilica in the northern Italian city of Padua have organised a festival inspired by the tradition among the faithful in the saint\u2019s homeland of Portugal, as well as Latin America, who invoke his intercession to help them find a life partner. People turn to Saint Anthony to retrieve either lost items, stolen goods or people, but also when in search of love. The event on Saturday \u2013 called Saint Anthony, matchmaker \u2013 is open to singles aged between 20 and 50 and will begin in the afternoon with a meeting to allow people to get to know each other. A mass will follow, during which the participants will say a prayer called If you look for miracles. A party labelled Love is all around will take place in the evening. Two hundred people had already registered online for the festival within hours of it being officially announced on Wednesday. Fr Oliviero Svanera, the rector of the basilica, said: \u201cI\u2019m a little worried there won\u2019t be enough room.\u201d This is the second time the friars have organised the event. Although the 2018 edition was more low profile, it brought together two couples. \u201cSo Saint Anthony has already played his part,\u201d Svanera said. The idea came about after Svanera and his fellow friars noticed a growing number of people who had yet to find a partner. \u201cEspecially in the 35-40 age group,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people who are single by choice and who are happy, but there are others who feel the loneliness and would like to meet someone to construct a life with.\u201d Svanera added that other commitments often stop people finding a relationship. \u201cEspecially in Italy, where it takes people a long time to settle \u2013 they feel they have to get a degree and a job before they can do that,\u201d he said. There were 8 million single-person households in Italy in 2017, according to the most recently published data, an increase of 1.5% since 2012. The festival, however, is not just about finding love. \u201cIt\u2019s about socialising and making friends,\u201d Svanera said. \u201cAnd yes, with the hope that Saint Anthony intervenes.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
