One of the original students at the London School of Contemporary Dance, he's been choreographing for more than three decades, has been artistic director of Rambert and is currently artistic director of The Place, where the company bearing his name was launched in 1994. Being establishment and cutting-edge is not easy, however, and the Richard Alston Dance Company's two-day Sadler's Wells debut was evidence of this. The first piece was Stampede, set to fourteenth-century Italian dances, played onstage by the Dufay Collective. There are many good things in Stampede: Alston's pattern-making is characteristically elegant. The self-absorption of the dancers resonates nicely with the fatalism of the music - Moorish in influence - and the oblique tableaux into which he groups them perfectly express the architecture of their condition. The problem is the steps. Classically derived, but with just enough of a twist to earn them modernist respectability, they are applied to the music with the prim exactitude of marigolds in a suburban border. Alston choreographs on the bias - on the turn of the form around the spine - and the result is a tasteful, minor-key physical jazz. The sort, unfortunately, that it's all too easy to ignore. The final section of Stampede offers a duet between Sonja Peedo and Martin Lawrance. Alston has said that his duets reference an ideal relationship, 'a way of being together which involves closeness and sympathy'. This is fine, and Peedo and Lawrance interact with the requisite tendresse, but neither Alston's ideal relationship nor his dance vocabulary appear to encompass physical desire. Compassion, yes. An understanding hand placed lightly on a companion's shoulder, sure. But sex, non. Which is a serious problem when you're making a piece - Rumours, Visions - about Rimbaud and Verlaine. These two were into sex in a very big way indeed. In 1871, aged 16, Rimbaud embarked on a passionate affair with the older married writer, and undertook a calculated 'disorientation of the senses' in which absinthe, drugs and occultism played a significant role. When Mathilde Verlaine objected, her husband set her on fire. The affair declined after Rimbaud's attempted murder by Verlaine. Alston has set his dance piece to the music written by Benjamin Britten to accompany Les Illuminations, a collection of Rimbaud's prose poems. These are psychedelic in tone and overtly charged with homoeroticism. Alston, however, turns a blind eye to this. Instead, Andrew Obaka and Martin Lawrance stalk sadly around each other, meeting at intervals for exquisitely made duets of the 'closeness and sympathy' sort. After a bit, Obaka (Verlaine) carries in Ellen Kane, presumably representing poor Mathilde, and a decorous parting ensues. The whole thing is impeccably refined and the familiar Alston steps dovetail perfectly with Britten's music. But if you are going to eliminate every whiff of lust from your work, then the co-authors of Sonnet du Trou du cul (Sonnet in Praise of the Arsehole) are not your ideal subjects. The evening closed with Touch and Go, Alston's take on the nuevo tango. No sweat, no smoulder, no cigar. \u00b7 Richard Alston Dance Company tours Theatr Brycheiniog (1 Nov); Cambridge Arts Theatre (7-9 Nov); Malvern Theatres (14, 15 Nov); Chichester Festival Theatre (27, 28 Nov); Edinburgh Festival Theatre (3 Dec) Jann Parry is away"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
