Christian Porter has sought advice on issuing a direction to the commonwealth director of public prosecutions that prosecutions of journalists cannot proceed without his sign-off, replicating a safeguard his predecessor, George Brandis, put in place for offences relating to reporting on special intelligence operations. Porter has also given comfort to critics of the bill by suggesting in comments to Fairfax Media it is \u201cinevitable\u201d there will be amendments, although they are likely to be minor. The espionage and foreign interference bill would increase tenfold the maximum penalty for anyone who communicates or \u201cdeals with\u201d information which could potentially \u201ccause harm to Australia\u2019s interests\u201d, where that information is obtained via a government official without authorisation. The bill would make it illegal for any person to communicate or deal with information obtained by a public servant that is \u201cinherently harmful\u201d or likely to harm \u201cAustralia\u2019s interests\u201d. Submissions to a parliamentary inquiry from media organisations have warned it could lead to journalists and whistleblowers being jailed for up to 20 years, and undermines the media\u2019s ability to act in the public interest. On Friday a spokesman for Porter said the attorney general believed existing protections in the bill were adequate but he would consider issuing a direction to require the DPP to obtain approval to prosecute journalists. The bill contains a defence where information is held or dealt with in \u201cthe public interest and in the person\u2019s capacity as a journalist\u201d. But the bill also states that \u201cinformation that will or is likely to harm or prejudice the health or safety of the public or a section of the public\u201d can never be in the public interest. Shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said: \u201cPorter\u2019s suggestion of a veto power for himself smacks of political interference in the work of the independent DPP and does not give us any satisfaction that the press freedoms will be protected\u201d. Porter reportedly said it was \u201cinevitable\u201d the bill would be changed, but rejected calls for a blanket exemption for journalists. \u201cWhere real improvements to clarity and consistency of drafting can be made they will be made,\u201d he said. Earlier Labor\u2019s communications spokeswoman, Michelle Rowland, said \u201cwidespread concerns\u201d about the impact of the proposals on journalists \u201cshows the need to review this legislation carefully\u201d. Labor would \u201calways support practical measures that strengthen protections in line with our national security interests\u201d, she said. \u201c[It is] highly likely that the government\u2019s bill will need amendment in order for it to be practical while not unintentionally impinging on the rights and freedoms enjoyed by all Australians, including journalists.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
