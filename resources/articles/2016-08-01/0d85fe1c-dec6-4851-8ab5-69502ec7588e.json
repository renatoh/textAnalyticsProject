Perhaps the best of them comes in the card\u2019s climactic contest, the Sprint, in which she will be aboard Muhadathat (4.05). This Mark Johnston three-year-old put up one of the most notable efforts in defeat at Glorious Goodwood last week, flying home after trouble in running to be beaten by half a length. She didn\u2019t stay six furlongs as a juvenile but looks ready for it now, and the greater test this track poses will make it less of a problem if she is as slow from the gates as she was nine days ago. The handicapper has raised her just 1lb. Tips for today\u2019s other TV races 1.15 Ascot Union Rose ran well here a month ago but didn\u2019t look entirely comfortable on a fast surface that day, which is off-putting because today\u2019s ground will be no slower. Out Do might be a better option, since his recent defeat at Doncaster hinted strongly at a return to form. He ran a few pounds above his current rating in that conditions event. 1.45 Ascot Declan Carroll is having a fine summer and Saigon City, new in his stable this year, still looks handicapped to win. He beat 14 rivals at York in May and was then nearest at the finish from a wide draw when fifth in the Northumberland Plate. This could work out better for him with the useful claimer Josephine Gordon on top. 2.20 Ascot Great Glen was actually dropped for an easy comeback maiden success and will surely be winning a handicap at some stage, but this might require something more battle-hardened. Baadi can bounce back from a soft-ground flop last time with a visor now fitted. 2.35 Haydock Dance King needs things to fall right but this is a good opportunity and Rachel Richardson is just about the pick of the riding talents involved. 2.55 Ascot Bancnuanaheireann went close in this a year ago but could have done with a prep-run. More attractive is Emell, dropping into this from much more competitive heats. He hasn\u2019t been this low in the handicap since his last win, in April 2015. 3.15 Newmarket The latest compliment to Fair Eva may be paid by Nations Alexander, no match for the chestnut at Haydock but otherwise very useful. She was beaten only by a couple of Irish raiders in the Cherry Hinton and the extra furlong here can help. 3.30 Ascot A course and distance winner last time, Real Dominion could be the first leg of Wilson\u2019s double. Fast ground is right up his street. 3.45 Haydock As good as ever since joining Godolphin, Scottish seems to relish this kind of fast ground. Something like the performance of his Listed win last time could be good enough here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
