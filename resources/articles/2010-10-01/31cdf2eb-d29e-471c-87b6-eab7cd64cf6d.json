But, as yesterday's exchanges at the first prime minister's question time beween David Cameron and Ed Miliband showed, it doesn't have to be like that. Keep the question specific and it is possible to hold the temperature down and still expose the weakness of the opponent's case. By repeatedly pressing the prime minister to explain how he could describe removing child benefit from higher-rate taxpayers regardless of household income as fair, the new Labour leader's performance made the arguments in the Commons chamber feel relevant and serious in a way that does not often happen any more. It should also have helped to reassure Labour MPs, who mostly did not vote for Mr Miliband, and even to make the coalition rethink its lines of attack. Mr Cameron may also remember \u2013 as Mr Miliband surely did \u2013 that he too once promised to bring back reasoned debate to the weekly Commons joust and, on his first outing, even jibed at the then prime minister, Tony Blair, for asking the questions instead of answering them. Mr Cameron's performance that day in December 2005 left his backbenchers calling for more. Labour MPs didn't go that far yesterday, but there was a lightening of the mood at a calm and confident start. For his next trick, Mr Miliband needs to do the same again. And again. And again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
