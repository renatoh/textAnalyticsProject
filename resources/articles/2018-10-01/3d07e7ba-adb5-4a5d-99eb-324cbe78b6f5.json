The sensation has yet to strike on the England stage. \u201cI\u2019ve only been in the door five minutes,\u201d the 21-year-old explains, not unreasonably. It is long enough to realise there can be no going back. \u201cWe have been given this opportunity to show what we are about in the seniors; me, Mason [Mount] and Jadon [Sancho],\u201d says Maddison, the eldest of the three new faces in Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad for Croatia and Spain. \u201cIf it was up to me I\u2019d never go back to the under-21s because this is where every young boy dreams of being. Aidy [Boothroyd, the under-21s manager] is saying: \u2018Give Gareth a choice where he doesn\u2019t put you back down and wants you here constantly in the squad\u2019, and that is what we are all aiming to achieve.\u201d For Leicester\u2019s \u00a325m summer signing from Norwich there is the opportunity to take residence in Southgate\u2019s plans. Eight Premier League appearances have brought three goals and a first England call-up for the attacking midfielder but it is the promise he offers in the No 10 role that appeals at international level. It was a position in which England were lacking at the World Cup, certainly when Deli Alli was absent, and where Maddison believes his future lies. The Coventry-born midfielder, who admits taking elements of David Silva\u2019s and Philippe Coutinho\u2019s game into his own, says: \u201cThe No 10 position is my favourite role. I am a player who likes to play in between the lines and try to break that midfield line whether it\u2019s when I receive a pass or can go and show everyone what I am about. \u201cI was always smaller than the rest coming up at Coventry and I developed physically more in the later stages. In the academies people develop differently and going into that No 10 role helped me because central midfield was always packed with big, strong boys. The No 10 helped take that edge out of it and, when I caught up physically, I had grown to love that role and made it my own at Coventry, so I went from there.\u201d Maddison went from his boyhood club to Norwich in January 2016 but it was a loan spell at Aberdeen later that year that he credits as invaluable in his development. A spectacular last-minute winner against Rangers in only his fourth appearance certainly helped with the transition. \u201cI had already played in League One at Coventry and this gave me a different challenge. Playing against the likes of Celtic and Rangers was a different prospect altogether, big crowds which you do not necessarily get at League One level. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Aberdeen. I still speak to the manager Derek McInnes now. It was a big learning curve for me. I mean, I was an 18-year-old lad playing in a Scottish League Cup final against Celtic at Hampden in front of 60,000. That\u2019s an experience I will never forget and I wouldn\u2019t have got by staying in England in the lower leagues. \u201cAll the moves I\u2019ve made have come after I sat down with my family and my agent and thought what was the best move. I\u2019ve never rushed into something, never gone anywhere where I wasn\u2019t sure 100%. I\u2019ve always trusted my decision, gone with my gut feeling and that was a good move for me and I look back with positive thoughts.\u201d Maddison\u2019s parents, Una and Gary, were the first people he called after receiving confirmation from the Football Association that he was in Southgate\u2019s squad for the Nations League double-header. \u201cSuper-proud of me,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are texting asking me what certain people are like.\u201d Their son is, by his own admission, supremely confident, although he does not come across as arrogant. Comfortable in his surroundings, for England and Leicester, would be one way of putting it. \u201cI always had the confidence,\u201d Maddison says. \u201cI went into pre-season with the mindset of: \u2018Be fearless, go and show everyone what you can do.\u2019 There was a moment in the warm-up at Old Trafford when the crowd was filling up and it just hit me that this was the Premier League. You see all these TV cameras around the pitch, which you don\u2019t get at Championship level, and I thought: \u2018I\u2019ve worked hard to be here. I deserve to be here. I belong here.\u2019 I did well on the day and we put in a good performance and maybe could have got more out of the game. \u201cThere is no bigger stage than Old Trafford on the opening day of the season. That was a dream I will never forget. Being called up by England is something I always dreamed of as a young boy as well; I\u2019m not going to hide that. I am honoured and truly grateful to be here.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
