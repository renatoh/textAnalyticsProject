Trump will welcome Pittsburgh Penguins to White House", "bodyText": "As Donald Trump faced backlash for his harsh criticism of athletes who have kneeled in protest for the national anthem, the Pittsburgh Penguins confirmed on Sunday they will visit the White House to celebrate their Stanley Cup victory. In a statement, the Penguins said they \u201crespect the institution of the Office of the President, and the long tradition of championship teams visiting the White House\u201d. The statement added: \u201cAny agreement or disagreement with a president\u2019s politics, policies or agenda can be expressed in other ways. However, we very much respect the rights of other individuals and groups to express themselves as they see fit.\u201d Trump confirmed the invitation with tweet. \u201cPlease[d] to inform that the Champion Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL will be joining me at the White House for Ceremony. Great team!\u201d he said. The announcement came on the same day unprecedented numbers of NFL players knelt and pursued other forms of protest and a day after Trump withdrew a similar invitation to the Golden State Warriors, breaking a tradition dating back to the Reagan years. On Friday, point guard Stephen Curry, the NBA champions\u2019 star player, told reporters he planned to vote no when the players came together to decide whether to visit Trump, adding the Warriors could \u201cinspire some change\u201d and \u201csend a statement\u201d by snubbing the president. On Saturday morning, Trump tweeted: \u201cGoing to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team, Stephen Curry is hesitating, therefore invitation is withdrawn!\u201d In a statement issued later, the Warriors said: \u201cWhile we intended to meet as a team at the first opportunity we had this morning to collaboratively discuss a potential visit to the White House, we accept that President Trump has made it clear that we are not invited. \u201cWe believe there is nothing more American than our citizens having the right to express themselves freely on matters important to them. We\u2019re disappointed that we did not have an opportunity during this process to share our views or have open dialogue on issues we felt would be important to raise. \u201cIn lieu of a visit to the White House, we have decided that we\u2019ll constructively use our trip to the nation\u2019s capital in February to celebrate equality, diversity and inclusion \u2013 the values that we embrace as an organization.\u201d The Super Bowl-champion New England Patriots were the first professional team to visit the White House since Trump took office in January. The Penguins defeated the Nashville Predators in June to capture a second straight Stanley Cup and their third in nine seasons. Their previous post-championship visits came during the presidencies of George HW Bush and Barack Obama."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
