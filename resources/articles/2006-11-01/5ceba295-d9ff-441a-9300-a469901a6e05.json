Although it seems designed for the sort of people (invariably men) who already own Xbox 360s, it is an undeniable tour de force. You play Marcus Fenix, sprung from jail to fight the Locust, heavily armed aliens who have emerged from the core of the game's Earth-like planet. But this time around, typical first-person shooter tactics do not apply. You must hop from cover to cover, work with your (usually four-strong) squad to outflank the enemy and generally adopt a tactical approach. And it mixes first-person and third-person views cleverly, so it's in no way a conventional FPS. Gears of War has incredible graphics, although its grim, dark comic-book look and copious blood-spatter effects aim it squarely at macho adult males, while its compelling co-operative multiplay and two-player co-op play modes add longevity. A true glimpse of the Xbox 360's capabilities. SB Call of Duty 3 Xbox 360, \u00a349.99, cert 15+ Treyarch/Activision, 4/5 Call of Duty 3 is visceral, intense and sporadically terrifying, but it's also very similar to Call of Duty 2. Veterans of that game will feel right at home as they battle the Nazis again. This time the action is centred on a specific part of the Normandy campaign, allowing greater narrative focus. The story is unimportant, though - Call of Duty is all about the action. And when you are crouched behind a wall with bullets fizzing past and grenades exploding nearby, make sure you loosen your grip on the joypad and shuffle back in your seat. Unfortunately, enemy soldiers display a total lack of self-preservation and often ruin the atmosphere generated by the fantastic graphics and sound. The multi-player compensates, with new options allowing you to play as a medic or scout. The best WW2 shooter ever, but we need new ideas next time. GH Star Wars Empire At War: Forces Of Corruption PC, \u00a319.99, cert 12+ LucasArts, 3/5 Empire at War was a bold attempt to replicate the success of space operas such as X3. It was also flawed - particularly through a realtime galactic map where you never had enough time to plan your moves correctly. Thankfully, this add-on addresses some of those problems while introducing a new storyline that straddles the events of Episode V. The scale is huge as your fledgling crimelord pits his wits against Alliance, Empire and mercenary forces. And although the planet-side battles remain cumbersome and shallow, the tactical complexity of conquering more than 50 planets should have RPG fans salivating. However, despite the presence of Luke Skywalker and friends, there's no doubt these franchises are losing their link to the essential Star Wars ethos.
