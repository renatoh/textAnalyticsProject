The timing was Medvedev's own: the speech was announced for late October but was twice postponed. So, what was it that Medvedev wanted to tell the new American president? \"We,\" he said, \"have no problems with the American nation, we have no inbred anti-Americanism. We hope our partners, the new United States administration, will make a choice in favour of full-fledged relations with Russia.\" It looks like this short expression of hope that the US will change its ways was the only reason for the delay. In his speech, Medvedev did not congratulate Obama on his victory and did not even mention him by name. In fact, as far as America goes, Medvedev's message seems to have been directed more at the outgoing administration, than the incoming one. He announced that Russia would place an Iskander rocket system in Kaliningrad \u2013 the Russia's exclave between Nato members, Poland and Lithuania \u2013 in order \"to neutralise the [US] missile defence system if necessary\"; that Russia may jam this system electronically; and that it is also considering using Russia's navy resources for the same purpose. He also mentioned that a missile division dislocated in the Kaluga region, which was supposed to be disbanded by 2010, will stay in service. Amazingly, despite all that, he also said that Russia would not be drawn into a new arms race. Medvedev blamed the \"conceited\" foreign policy of the US for the August war in Georgia and Ossetia, and said that Russia \"will not retreat from the Caucasus\". He also blamed the world economic crisis on America's failure to coordinate its economic policy with other countries, for, in his view, it was this lack of coordination that had turned the \"local\" crisis into a global one. The Russian president did not exactly call the US the \"evil empire\", as Ronald Reagan used to refer to the Soviet Union, but he left Russians in no doubt as to who the main baddy in the world is. This may not be an inbred anti-Americanism, but anti-Americanism it certainly is. Having placated the hawks by his foreign policy statements, Medvedev offered some consolation to the liberals in his internal policy proposals. True, he has suggested the extension of the president's and parliament's terms to six years \u2013 simultaneously saying that he would not change the constitution, only amend it. But his proposed changes of the electoral law could give hope to liberal parties, and his insistence that democratic institutions will not be disbanded, that \"freedom\" is the greatest value, that censorship should be outlawed and that prosecutors should not \"overdo\" arrests, are music to liberal ears. If only such themes could be turned into reality \u2026 Obama and Medvedev cannot just turn the page and start relations between Russia and the US from scratch. There is simply no such thing in international relations as a blank sheet. But the pendulum of anti-Americanism in Russia has swung too far for Russia's own security; so, despite Medvedev's harsh words, there is hope that the Americans will not be the only ones to change their ways. Perhaps, watching the enthusiasm with which the world is embracing the new American president, Russia will amend its ways too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
