The most dramatic increase has been at the V&amp;A, which has seen a 111% increase, helped by the opening of its beautiful \u00a331m British galleries. The effect at the other museums in South Kensington, west London, where a family visit would have cost around \u00a330 in charging days, has been almost as spectacular. Numbers at the Science Museum and Natural History Museum have gone up 100% and 83% respectively. The culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, called the increase \"a tribute to the energy and imagination of the museums themselves, and a clear rebuttal to those who say the people of this country are not interested in serious culture\". David Barrie, director of the Art Fund charity, which led the campaign for free museums, welcomed the figures but warned the government that the job of revitalising the museum sector was far from over. \"Free admission in itself is not enough, if the museums' grant in aid is inadequate for them to fulfil their core functions. One result of underfunding is that most museums have little or no funds to acquire objects to add to their collections - and we at the Art Fund feel the impact of that, in appeals for help every day from museums and galleries.\" Mark Jones, director of the V&amp;A, was jubilant at the figures. It was one of the last of the major museums to introduce a compulsory \u00a35 admission charge, in 1997, only to see visitor numbers halved. \"These are the highest visitor figures in the V&amp;A's history, with more than 2 million visitors, and show free entry has been a resounding success,\" he said. \"We have more than doubled our visitors in the year since we introduced free entry. More people are visiting for the first time, and more are making return visits.\" Several museums scrapped charges very reluctantly, fearing exposing their finances to political whims. For them the most welcome part of Ms Jowell's statement today is her assurance that \"we are committed to this policy, and additional funding has now been made available to all the sponsored museums and galleries to allow it to continue.\" However, there is no hint of expansion of free admission to a second tier of museums, including the Dulwich Picture Gallery, the Design Museum, and the London Transport Museum, which in some cases have been badly hit by having to compete with the free nationals. Charles Saumarez Smith, director of the National Gallery, warmly welcomed the figures as \"tremendously encouraging\", despite his disappointment at failing to persuade the government to provide a better financial settlement for his museum. Both he and Mr Barrie said that the spectacular figures had exploded the argument, made by some reluctant museum directors, that charging had little impact on visitors. \"It has demonstrated beyond doubt the enormous public benefits of free admission in terms of opening up cultural institutions to more visitors and more regular use,\" Mr Saumarez Smith said. \"The argument that charging is not a deterrent has been blown out of the water,\" Mr Barrie said. The great question still to be answered is whether free admission to the nationals is truly increasing museum visiting, or simply redistributing it. A survey this year for the Museums Association suggested that, overall, visiting is declining, with the impact of free admission felt most in the prosperous south-east where the major collections are concentrated, at the expense of the regions.
