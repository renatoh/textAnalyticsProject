The Lions, who were beaten by Halifax in the fourth round only to be reinstated when the Yorkshire club were found guilty of fielding an ineligible player, were thrashed 58-6 by Batley, who now face the Catalans Dragons in the quarter-finals on Sunday week. The Catalans will be able to include Brent Sherwin, the Australian scrum-half who is set to complete a shock move from Castleford to Perpignan in the next 24 hours. Sherwin, who has been an expensive failure since joining Castleford from the Canterbury Bulldogs two years ago, is still eligible to play in the cup for the French club because he did not appear for the Tigers in earlier rounds. Meanwhile Leeds's former New Zealand full-back Brent Webb still hopes to play in the Rhinos' quarter-final against Wigan at Headingley on Saturday week. Webb's appeal against a two-match suspension imposed for a high tackle in last Friday's Super League victory over Warrington will be heard today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
