The old Lancashire rivals are claiming that the tougher points deductions introduced for the 2007 season - from a minimum of four points to a maximum of 12, compared with the previous range of two to six - should not apply to the offences currently being investigated because they were committed in 2006. Lindsay and his Saints counterpart, Eamonn McManus, have requested a preliminary hearing with the independent three-man tribunal appointed by the Rugby Football League. The tribunal will consider the cases of St Helens and Bradford tonight, with Wigan's defence to be heard next Monday. Saints, who were docked two points in 2003 for breaching the cap in winning the Super League title the previous year, are not thought to be in much trouble this time but Wigan's situation is potentially more serious, meaning that there could be more points at stake in tonight's preliminary hearing than in the game against Leeds. Lindsay, however, in his only public comment on the affair, insisted that the club would be pleading not guilty at their main hearing next Monday and had acted \"honestly and reasonably\" throughout. The 12 Super League clubs voted to introduce the tougher points penalties for 2007 at a meeting in June 2006. Both Wigan and Bradford, who have not attempted to challenge the new scale, are aiming to avoid a second consecutive punishment - they were each docked two points last season after pleading guilty to breaching the cap in 2005. Leeds have the chance to pull two points clear at the top of the table tonight, having learned yesterday that Brian McClennan will coach them when Tony Smith becomes the full-time England coach next year. McClennan rejected an attempt by the New Zealand Rugby League to persuade him to stick with them until next autumn's World Cup."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
