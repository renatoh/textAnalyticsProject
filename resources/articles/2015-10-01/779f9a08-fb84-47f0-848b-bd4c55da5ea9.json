Tired, but happy. The Sydney musician is about to release her fifth album \u2013 a fun, synth-laden document she says is \u201ctotally about love\u201d called Eternal Return. But another newly completed project has been keeping her up at night: the birth of her first child. \u201cI\u2019m a servant to this very small master,\u201d she says over the phone. \u201cI wasn\u2019t prepared for how much he sounds like a wild animal when he\u2019s sleeping. He\u2019s still operating on a very base kind of level.\u201d Since Blasko\u2019s 2004 debut The Overture &amp; the Underscore established her as a staple of sophisticated pop, the artist\u2019s own base level appears to be \u201chard work\u201d. This year has already heralded the release of Emergence, her experimental collaborative album with the composer Nick Wales, in conjunction with the Sydney Dance Company, along with her scorings for Ruben Guthrie, the directorial feature film debut of Brendan Cowell, and for the artist Del Kathryn Barton\u2019s animated short The Nightingale and the Rose. Then there\u2019s the big-ticket preview of Eternal Return at the Sydney Opera House, with visuals from the film-maker Mike Daly as part of Graphic festival. The annual event\u2019s tagline is \u201ca festival of graphic storytelling, animation and music\u201d. That Blasko can claim a hand in all three disciplines speaks to her diverse abilities. Blasko\u2019s propensity to collaborate might be traced to a single detour: in 2008 she was asked to co-compose music and perform in Bell Shakespeare\u2019s staging of Hamlet. \u201cI just loved watching that whole process,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI went to way more rehearsals than I needed to. I was fascinated by how actors work. Music and creating stuff aside, I\u2019m just a bit nosey. I want to know how these things are done.\u201d That curiosity bolstered her songwriting,. \u201cI think there\u2019s a real strength in taking songwriting away from your own identity and who you are,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s a craft in it. Demystifying the whole idea of it being you and being a bit more identity-less. It\u2019s got to make someone feel something but it doesn\u2019t have to be your feelings.\u201d The new album, Eternal Return, is the result of another collaborative process, but this time the feelings of its writer are plain. \u201cI wanted to write some love songs. There\u2019s other subject matter on there but there\u2019s no hiding it\u2019s about love \u2013 capturing the sensation at the time it was happening [to me] in its early fresh stages.\u201d As with her previous two albums, I Awake (2012) and As Day Follows Night (2009), she began writing the songs at the piano. Thinking the results sounded depressing, she switched to a Prophet synthesiser. \u201cI didn\u2019t want ballads but a joyous experience. I was interested in trying to make a tight pop record and keeping it really succinct.\u201d Blasko hired ex-Gerling member Burke Reid (the Drones, the Mess Hall, Jack Ladder) to co-produce and, despite her pregnancy throughout the recording process, Reid held her to her word, sometimes egging her on into the early hours. \u201cI\u2019d sort of produced I Awake and so being produced by someone else again was a skill I had to relearn. I really hated Burke a few times,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cBut I wanted that, I wanted to be directed. You\u2019ve always got to take a hold of yourself and be true to yourself \u2013 not let someone direct you to do things you don\u2019t want to do, but have someone sharing the vision. Hold you to what you said you wanted it to be.\u201d The actor and director Brendan Cowell knows this first-hand. Working with Blasko on Ruben Guthrie, he says his friend\u2019s determination and work ethic is unparalleled. \u201cSarah as a person is quite whimsical and funny and eccentric,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when she slips into work mode it\u2019s like she is running the military. \u201cShe\u2019s obsessed with what she does and she leaves no stone unturned. She didn\u2019t stop until she was completely happy with what she had made for me.\u201d One suspects that sort of conviction \u2014 or reduction to basic instinct \u2014 is a hard-won and attractive skill. \u201cI suppose I\u2019m pretty honest with people in terms of how I feel about things,\u201d Blasko says of her collaborative charms. \u201cI\u2019m quite passionate about stuff that I work on. I\u2019ve definitely got opinions that aren\u2019t necessarily to do with the music and that can really work for someone or not. \u201cThe results can be really strong, but it\u2019s sort of like putting a bridle on a brumby \u2013 I resist at the same time. It\u2019s very revealing and you can\u2019t hide.\u201d \u2022 Sarah Blasko debuts Eternal Return at Graphic festival on 11 October. The album is out on 4 November"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
