But he was slightly more reassuring when United pressed late on. Branislav Ivanovic - 6 Evra and Nani tested him at right-back, exposing him at times, and he was dawdling as Rooney turned and fizzed in the visitors' opener. Happier when restored to the centre late on. John Terry - 7 Clearly enjoys working with David Luiz, with the captain content to sit deep and allow his partner to maraud forward in possession. Chelsea's needed his strength at times to keep the visitors at bay. David Luiz - 8 Continues to catch the eye at either end, clearing from Fletcher's centre and dispatching a volley with his weaker foot to claw the hosts level. Booked and, perhaps, fortunate that one off-the-ball incident with Rooney went unpunished. Ashley Cole - 6 His early attacking touches provoked the inevitable chorus of \"shoot\" from the stands, but he was pinned back until the interval. Chelsea worked to liberate him thereafter, and his threat grew. Ramires - 7 Meanders in-field so often that Chelsea lack width on their right, particularly with Ivanovic only a sporadic attacking force. But his energy erupted at times. Booked for late lunge at Carrick. Michael Essien - 6 Nominally the most defensive of Chelsea's central midfielders, but bypassed when United built up a head of steam and passed around him. His dynamism is not what it once was. Booked. Frank Lampard - 7 His penalty was dispatched with gusto, and he would have enjoyed the space that opened up after the interval as Chelsea pushed higher to discomfit the league leaders, even if sights of goal from open play were rare. Florent Malouda - 5 Should have scored with virtually his first touch, scuffing a shot from just inside the area straight at Van der Sar, and his evening did not improve much after that. His form has rather dwindled. Fernando Torres - 7 The wait for his first Chelsea goal is prolonged. The initial surge had been so promising, his interchanges with Anelka a continuation of events in Copenhagen, yet his early strike was ruled out . Nicolas Anelka - 6 Had started so well, setting up Malouda with a fine opportunity after gliding into space, and enjoying his partnership with Torres. But, starved of the ball, his threat was steadily reduced. Subs Drogba for Anelka, 61, Zhirkov for Malouda, 71, Bosingwa for Luiz, 81 Subs not used Turnbull, Ferreira, Bosingwa, Kalou, McEachran. Manchester United Edwin van der Sar - 8 There were two astonishing reaction saves to deny Ivanovic in front of goal, pushing the Serb's mistimed attempt on to Vidic and then palming the ball away while prone. The veteran continues to excel. John O'Shea - 7 Solid enough and a willing worker at right-back, tracking Malouda and nullifying his impact for long periods. There were sprints forward at times, too, to impress Gary Neville in the away support. Chris Smalling - 7 The smoothness of his adaptation to life in the first team could be gauged by how the centre-half was hardly noticed here until Zhirkov cleverly won his penalty. What he could have done to avoid that is open to question. Nemanja Vidic - 6 Sent off in stoppage time for two bookable offences having been beaten in the air by Ivanovic for Chelsea's equaliser. He had been a tower of strength for long periods, but will now miss the game with Liverpool. Patrice Evra - 7 Was a constant threat down the left, either in partnership with Nani or Hernandez, the side's striking pivot. His presence tends to infuriate Chelsea, though he might have done better at David Luiz's goal. Darren Fletcher - 6 There was energy to complement his abrasive tackling, his ability to surge to the byline unsettling Cole and contributing to United's initial dominance. He hugged the touchline at times, offering real width to stretch the play. Michael Carrick - 6 Steady enough in the centre, if never dominating, and returned to intercept smartly when Chelsea did press forward. Hardly a dynamic presence, still, but tidy when momentum is with his team. Paul Scholes - 6 There were gasps at one uncharacteristically poor touch, but the veteran still tidied up effectively in his midfield brief and maintained the visitors' initial superiority with his metronomic passing. Nani - 7 Riled Ivanovic with his insistence at dribbling at the Serbian full-back, and was a genuine threat whenever given space in which to veer. United would have liked more bite at the end of the skill. Javier Hern\u00e1ndez - 7 His combination play with Rooney was slick, his pace on the turf surprising when he was allowed the chance to run on to balls slipped from midfield and maraud down the channels. Starved of chances. Wayne Rooney - 7 \"Fortunate\" to have played according to his manager, but majestic in skimming the visitors ahead having been allowed to turn. That was a fifth goal in five league games to suggest form is flooding back. Subs Giggs for Scholes, 70, Berbatov for Hern\u00e1ndez, 70, F da Silva for Evra, 81 Subs not used Kuszczak, Brown, Berbatov, Giggs, F Da Silva, R da Silva, Gibson."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
