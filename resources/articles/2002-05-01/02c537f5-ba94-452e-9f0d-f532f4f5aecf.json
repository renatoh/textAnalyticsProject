When the sun shines and Yorkshire are in town, there is no better place to watch cricket than Taunton. The visiting supporters ink in this fixture as soon as their club diaries arrive, the ground is full and the combination of a flat wicket and short boundaries promise plenty of runs. As two excellent one-day sides rose to the occasion, standing eyeball to eyeball and punching their weight, the day's tally reached a remarkable 613. When Darren Lehmann, not the most athletically built of cricketers, leapt like a salmon to deny his fellow Australian Jamie Cox a deserved century, it was clear just how much needle there was in this wonderful day's cricket. Having righted himself, Lehmann turned to the nearest Somerset benches and gave a one-finger salute, the antipodean way of marking his first catch of the innings. Cox's 82-ball 99, in a 12-over stand of 103 with Ian Blackwell, kept the drama alive into the evening, but a couple of crucial wickets for Chris Silverwood, and the best spell of the day by Matthew Hoggard, saw Yorkshire home. The left-handed Blackwell followed up his run-a-ball century in the championship match between these two sides with a spectacular 79 from 54 deliveries. He is seeing the ball like a balloon at the moment and his first misjudgment was also his last, when he walked inside a straight Silverwood delivery hoping to waft it to leg. But Cox was no less energetic. The River Tone is reached less often these days since the construction of the hulking Ian Botham Stand, but a vast Cox six off the off-spinner Andy Gray clipped the roof. While Cox and Blackwell were cruising, the Yorkshire crowd were subdued, but the release of frustration when Lehmann snared his rival was deafening. The substance of Yorkshire's innings came from the centurions Matthew Wood and Lehmann, who put together a 23-over liaison that gained in momentum to produce 170 runs. Wood was the anchor-man, and although it was the 18th over before Lehmann strutted to the crease, the Yorkshire skipper was in violent mood, catching his partner and posting a 72-ball hundred. His reverse sweep was fruitful after his first two attempts went straight to Jones, lurking at backward square leg halfway to the short pavilion boundary. Once Lehmann assessed the angles, however, he put the ball to each side of the fielder several times until he tried the shot once too often to the off-spinner Keith Dutch. But some further biffing by Wood and a sprightly Anthony McGrath, and the occasional sloppy fielding mistake by Somerset, saw Yorkshire avenge their three-day defeat in the championship."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
