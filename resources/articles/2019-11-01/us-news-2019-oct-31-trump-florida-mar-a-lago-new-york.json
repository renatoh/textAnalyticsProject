Donald Trump has changed his primary residence from Manhattan to Mar-a-Lago \u2013 the exclusive golf club that he has referred to as the \u201cwinter White House\u201d. \u201cI cherish New York,\u201d Trump said in a tweet on Thursday. But, he said, \u201cdespite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state.\u201d In September, Donald and Melania Trump filed for residency in Palm Beach, according to documents obtained by the New York Times. \u201cIf I maintain another place or places of abode in some other state or states, I hereby declare that my above-described residence and abode in the State of Florida constitutes my predominant and principal home, and I intend to continue it permanently as such,\u201d reads the \u201cdeclaration of domicile\u201d Trump filed. His other \u201cplace or places of abode\u201d include 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue \u2013 the White House \u2013 and his private golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump Tower in Manhattan has been Trump\u2019s primary residence since 1983, but he has spent little time there since becoming president. According to NBC News, Trump has spent 99 days at Mar-a-Lago and only 20 days at Trump Tower since taking office. Residency in Florida could bring tax benefits because it does not have a state income tax or inheritance tax. Trump remains unpopular in his home state, and has expressed frustrations at the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s subpoena seeking the president\u2019s tax returns. Andrew Cuomo, the New York governor, said in a tweet: \u201cGood riddance.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s all yours, Florida,\u201d Cuomo said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
