But managing the relationship between our two countries is more complex than exporting iron and coal \u2013 it requires a deeper understanding, as Dr Amy King explains. \u201cIn Australia, like every other country in the world, we\u2019re facing a great moment of uncertainty in terms of the global economy and on the international order more generally,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a deep contest and uncertainty about what sort of relationship with China we ought to have.\u201d As a Westpac Research Fellow and leading researcher at ANU, Dr King\u2019s research focuses on the ideas and strategies underpinning China\u2019s economic policies. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever for Australia to better understand China. Not because we need to have a close, cosy relationship necessarily, but because China is so important to the global economy, to Australia\u2019s economy, and to a whole host of other issues.\u201d In 2016, our trade relationship with China was worth $155.2 billion, accounting for nearly one-third of our exports and one-fifth of our imports. Knowing how to sustain and grow this positive impact on our local economy goes beyond simple transactions. \u201cTo understand China today, we need to understand China of the past,\u201d Dr King offers. \u201cIt\u2019s a country that thinks in terms of decades - and centuries-long ideas. We need to remember that we\u2019re trying to build something for the long-term in this relationship, and that\u2019s going to mean investing in political relationships, business relationships, and understanding the way in which Chinese people think about these issues.\u201d Future Schwarzman Scholar and 2017 Westpac Asian Exchange Scholar Jacinta Keast says a pivotal issue for Australia is that our security depends on the US, while our economy depends on China. \u201cAs much as you want to separate those two relationships,\u201d she says, \u201cthey are intertwined. That\u2019s the key issue that every government, every company in Australia faces. You can\u2019t just deal with one of those issues. When China looks at trade with Australia, they\u2019re also looking to see how we manage US relations.\u201d Like Dr King, Keast says that spending time immersed in Chinese language and culture is paramount to maintaining this balance. \u201cThe best way to understand what\u2019s going on in China is to spend time in China. If you can\u2019t understand, speak or read Chinese, there\u2019s an entire other level of understanding that\u2019s inaccessible to you.\u201d Philanthropic programs like the Westpac Scholars Trust support Australian researchers and university students with opportunities to deepen that understanding. Every year, they provide 100 scholarships focusing on strengthening Australia-Asia ties, technology and innovation, and creating positive social change. The result: a new generation of thought leaders with profound contributions to make. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have that scholarship,\u201d says Keast, \u201cI couldn\u2019t have afforded to go on exchange to Beijing. When I got back, I was able to take on translation work, and look at primary sources in Mandarin and English, and do research on different areas of the Australia-China relationship, including looking at areas such as China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, agriculture, the levels of Chinese international students in Australia, and China\u2019s influence in the Pacific.\u201d Emmelyn Wu is also a 2017 Westpac Asian Exchange Scholar. Through her online platform, Moonrise, she has created a space for people of Asian descent who have grown up in western societies: \u2018Asians Between Cultures\u2019. She says the organisation hopes to help inspire and pioneer a new generation of cultural advocates who openly engage with experiences contextual to the western Asian experience \u2013 something she sees as vital to fostering positive relationships. \u201cPeople often fear or are apprehensive about what they don\u2019t know or understand,\u201d she says. \u201cBy sharing stories and taking steps to understand how Asian/Western cultures impact our individual values, we can hopefully turn any cultural tensions into opportunities for growth. Australia\u2019s close proximity to Asia and a large number of Asian, especially Chinese, immigrants make it even more pertinent for us to try and better understand each other.\u201d Wu reiterates the importance of cultural understanding to strong Australia-China relations. \u201cTo be able to understand, engage with and cooperate with other countries and cultures,\u201d she says, \u201cit is important and helpful to be able to metaphorically (and literally) \u2018speak their language\u2019. That is, being able to communicate in ways that both sides understand and are familiar with; finding common ground and creating a shared responsibility. By providing Asian Exchange Scholars with the opportunity to travel to different parts of Asia, they too will be able to learn, grow, and understand more about Asia and its relationship with Australia.\u201d First-hand, local and independent new knowledge is what sets Westpac Scholars apart. Studying and learning in China is an opportunity many researchers would otherwise miss out on, and Dr King says her fellowship has given her something else she craved: time. \u201cThe independence to go where the research takes us is one of the most powerful ways that philanthropic organisations like this can really benefit Australia \u2013 the time and sustained thought to create new knowledge. I wake up every day loving my job.\u201d \u201cThe real benefit from a researcher\u2019s perspective,\u201d she says, \u201cis that you can ask the questions you think are really important, and spend that sustained time thinking deeply about how China seeks to shape the global economy - one of the most important questions facing the world today.\u201d A question, when answered, that will reverberate through the Australian economy for years to come.
