Sabo, a former US marine who considers leftism a \u201cdisorder\u201d, told the Guardian on Wednesday he created the posters that show Streep with a red stripe across her face and the text \u201cShe knew\u201d, a reference to accusations that she had knowledge of Weinstein\u2019s alleged sexual abuse of women. Sabo, 49, said he and two collaborators conceived the campaign as retaliation for Streep using her latest Oscar-tipped film, The Post, to bash Trump. \u201cShe\u2019s swiping at us so we\u2019re swiping back.\u201d About a dozen posters in the style of the conceptual artist Barbara Kruger sprouted across LA on Tuesday, including near Streep\u2019s house, near the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists\u2019 headquarters and near the studio lot of 20th Century Fox, which made The Post. Sabo has been called an \u201calt-right\u201d version of Banksy. He says Republicans are the new punks, and makes a living selling inflammatory artwork at conservative events and through his website, plus contract work for the likes of Milo Yiannopoulos. Sabo said he did not know if Streep had in fact enabled Weinstein\u2019s alleged decades of abuse. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sitting in a room with her. I can\u2019t say 100%. But I\u2019d say anyone in the (film) industry had a pretty good idea. I think she knew. Maybe she was providing Weinstein with the fresh meat.\u201d The poster campaign caps a torrid week for Streep who was already on the defensive after fellow actor Rose McGowan, who says she was raped by Weinstein, accused the grand dame of Hollywood of silence and hypocrisy. McGowan made the accusation in a now deleted tweet which was prompted by reports that women will wear black at next month\u2019s Golden Globes awards show in solidarity with victims of sexual misconduct. \u201cActresses, like Meryl Streep, who happily worked for The Pig Monster, are wearing black @goldenglobes in a silent protest. YOUR SILENCE is THE problem. You\u2019ll accept a fake award breathlessly &amp; affect no real change. I despise your hypocrisy.\u201d Streep, who worked on several films produced by Weinstein and once jokingly referred to him as \u201cGod\u201d, has denied any knowledge of his alleged rapes, assaults and harassment, allegations which the New York Times and New Yorker made public in October. In a statement, the Oscar winner expressed hurt at being assailed by McGowan. \u201cBut I want to let her know I did not know about Weinstein\u2019s crimes, not in the 90s when he attacked her, or through subsequent decades when he proceeded to attack others. I wasn\u2019t deliberately silent. I didn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t tacitly approve of rape. I didn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t like young women being assaulted. I didn\u2019t know this was happening.\u201d Several commentators have defended The Iron Lady star, calling it perverse that women should be faulted for men\u2019s alleged predations. \u201cWomen aren\u2019t responsible for men\u2019s bad behavior. We\u2019re not the sex police,\u201d Heidi Stevens wrote in the Chicago Tribune. It is unclear if the attacks on Streep will dent her chances of an Oscar nomination for The Post, in which she plays Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham during the paper\u2019s decision to publish the Pentagon Papers in 1971, a free press milestone. Steven Spielberg, who directed, and Tom Hanks, who plays the Post\u2019s editor, Ben Bradlee, have joined Streep in billing the film as a rebuttal of Trump administration broadsides against media villainy and \u201cfake news\u201d. It was initially unclear who was behind the Streep posters, which went up overnight and were not signed. Sabo said in an interview on Wednesday that he printed and erected the posters with an assistant. The artist, who has previously targeted Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and others on the left, said a fellow conservative collaborator, whom he declined to name, suggested a campaign against The Post because it was being \u201cused as a platform\u201d to attack Trump. \u201cWe wanted to take a swipe back.\u201d However they ended up targeting just Streep, who used a Golden Globes speech almost a year ago to excoriate the president as a xenophobic bully. Sabo, who uses a pseudonym derived from a tank munition called sabot, is selling prints of the poster for $25 on his website. Another recent stunt was a billboard mocking Al Franken, the Democratic senator who resigned after groping allegations. The artist said he had no reason to target Trump over his boast, caught on Access Hollywood tape, about assaulting women. \u201cI don\u2019t know a man who I\u2019ve had a beer who doesn\u2019t talk shit like that. We don\u2019t have proof of Trump doing it. Who am I to judge him on that?\u201d Critics consider Sabo\u2019s work crude, bigoted, racist and misogynistic. He disputed that criticism in an interview at his apartment-cum-studio last June: \u201cThe blacks, the Jews, the underdogs \u2013 no one has a bigger heart for them than me.\u201d He works beneath a sign that says \u201cFuck Tibet\u201d. Another says \u201cFuck peace\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
