We met in our early 20s and started our relationship long-distance. I relocated to the UK and we moved in together. Early on, he would go out and come back much later than he had promised, leaving me unsure if I should be worried or angry. We would have massive and unproductive fights. We had to cancel plans as he was too hungover. I made up my mind that I would leave him if his behaviour did not change. The next time it happened, I left for the day. He finally took me seriously, became scared of losing me, and this behaviour stopped. But in the following years, we got into a cycle of me finding empty bottles of alcohol hidden around the house, him promising to change, then me finding empty bottles again. We got married, bought a house and he ran up debts. When confronted, he lied then came clean: most of the money had been used to buy alcohol. He started to attend an addiction programme, but did not complete it. He also tried Alcoholics Anonymous, but gave up after a while. We both went to see a couples therapist, but he was not honest about his drinking. Recently, after seeing a therapist, I was feeling confident and we started trying for a baby, but this week I found some empty wine bottles. I love him and I want to stay with him. I couldn\u2019t face the amount of hurt I would cause us if I left. He is sweet, kind and considerate, and does more than his fair share of housework. We share much joy. I want him to get better, but I realise that I cannot make him change. Your original letter was more than 2,000 words long, and I could see you struggling to be fair to your husband while trying to make sense of your situation. Let me simplify things for you: your husband is an alcoholic, he lies to you and himself, he does not want to change \u2013 at least not at the moment \u2013 and he cannot take responsibility for his actions, often blaming you for his behaviour. No amount of \u201cdoing housework\u201d can make up for this. I would put any baby-making plans on hold. You sound more than reasonable \u2013 believe that. You say you have panic attacks and suffer from anxiety \u2013 this may well be your body trying to tell you something your mind won\u2019t accept: that you cannot go on like this. I showed Chris Mills, a psychotherapist, your full letter. He felt your husband\u2019s behaviour patterns were \u201ctypical of an addict\u2026 the only time he seriously looks as if he might address his behaviour is when you seriously look as if you might leave him\u201d. Mills has worked with many alcoholics. \u201cYour husband needs professional help,\u201d he said. \u201cSaying, \u2018AA isn\u2019t for me\u2019 doesn\u2019t cut it. If he wants to remain in a relationship with you, he needs to accept his drinking isn\u2019t just about him.\u201d Mills\u2019s point is that your husband deceives, and that you are \u201cvery good at letting him get away with it and deceiving yourself. Are you at risk of normalising his drinking by staying with him?\u201d This is not meant to sound harsh, but you have put up with this for 10 years, and I think you may have become inured to his behaviour. This is no way to live. Do you really want to be here in another 10 years? Mills had what I think is a great idea: could you separate for three months, giving him time to realise that you are serious, and hopefully start treatment? \u201cSay to him: \u2018See you in three months.\u2019 He will be furious that you\u2019ve pushed him into a corner, but the thing about not staying under the same roof is that you don\u2019t have to police what he\u2019s up to, or check for bottles.\u201d Also, policing would be exhausting for you. I think time away will really help you see the weight you are carrying. It is very hard to leave a \u201cnice\u201d but damaged man, so this won\u2019t be easy, but we both think you need to draw a line that can\u2019t be crossed: either he seeks treatment, or you leave. \u201cThink of it as an illness,\u201d Mills said. \u201cImagine a diabetic refusing to take their medication: how aggressive would that be? That\u2019s what your husband is doing \u2013 he\u2019s not getting treatment, and you are suffering. It\u2019s not on and it\u2019s not fair.\u201d If you stay with this man and he refuses to get treatment, and if you have children with him, your children will grow up with an alcoholic father. I can\u2019t imagine that\u2019s what you want for them . \u2022Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.com. Annalisa regrets she cannot enter into personal correspondence.
