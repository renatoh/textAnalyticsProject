If he scored every chance he would be a 50, 60, 70 million pound player, wouldn't he? But any team without him is a far poorer side. I just thought he was head and shoulders the best player on the pitch.\" Kenny Dalglish may not be in a position to echo Warnock's entire sentiment but it would be hard to disagree. A week that opened with defeat at Fulham plus an improper conduct charge for Su\u00e1rez and prompted the Liverpool manager to construct a DVD defence of a player crucial to the club's ambitions of qualifying for the Champions League closed with the \u00a322.8m striker again in the spotlight but for the reason he was brought to Anfield from Ajax in January. A fifth league goal of the season, his eighth in total, secured Liverpool's first home win in five matches, took them above Newcastle United in the table and left Dalglish purring over an asset that he rightly says cannot be measured in goals alone. However, life would be so much easier at Anfield if they had a potency that complemented their improving performance level. On Saturday they dominated QPR yet spent the final minutes agonising over the threat of an unwarranted equaliser. Dalglish said: \"Performance wise, we don't have any problem whatsoever. Goals; yeah, we'd love more and we'll get more. We did miss some chances but the goalkeeper saved a lot of them too. I trust the players implicitly when it comes to scoring, implicitly. They continued to get in there on goal and, even with the keeper having a good day, they didn't drop their heads. They must be enjoying what they are doing, to continue playing like that and creating chances like that. One day, creating chances like that, we are going to get a load. Or we are going to be garbage and win 1-0. And I think that will do us.\" Not for the first time this season Anfield's visitors were accompanied by a goalkeeper in outstanding form. Radek Cerny, a third-choice keeper promoted through injuries, produced several excellent saves, particularly from the relentless and unfortunate Maxi Rodr\u00edguez, but he was not solely responsible for a scoreline that flattered his team-mates. Su\u00e1rez alone could have sealed victory before half-time but finally delivered moments after the restart when, having lost Luke Young and been picked out by a precision cross from Charlie Adam, he steered a header beyond Cerny. It was the striker's first in the league since 1 October and the least he deserved for another display of menace and creativity. \"You can't keep him quiet,\" Warnock lamented. \"I don't think you can keep him quiet against anybody. I think what you have to do with Su\u00e1rez is hope that he is suspended when you play him. That is what I was hoping. He has got everything. He gives 110% every game, he never lets the defender settle, he twists and turns. All right, his finishing wasn't so good but he still won the match. Whatever they paid for him it was worth every penny, every penny.\" In the comforts of home and with the travelling hordes in light-hearted form there was no test of Su\u00e1rez's temper on Saturday, although Warnock repeated his unenforceable call for action to be taken against supporters who barrack the Uruguayan. The QPR manager said: \"He is a foreign player in a foreign country. The crowd away from home gives him so much stick he should be protected from that as much as possible. Yes, he has got to learn that he cannot be making gestures but bloody hell, the stick he gets, it is about time someone did something about it. I think the FA and Premier League should do something. \"They are so quick to charge him in terms of putting a finger up. Look at the abuse he is getting and charge the clubs concerned if they are going to give abuse like that. The stewards must hear it away from home but they turn a deaf ear.\" For once Dalglish had no such concerns. \"I did speak to Luis,\" replied the Liverpool manager when asked whether he felt compelled to advise Su\u00e1rez following events at Craven Cottage. \"I said well done wee man, great goal.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
