The concept is also being linked to the government\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Australian Securities and Investment Commission and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has hired the US company People Rocket LLC, which suggests it can replace traditional management consultancy by developing \u201ccultures that champion innovation through cross-functional collaboration\u201d. People Rocket is led by a Stanford graduate school of business lecturer, Richard Cox Braden, who the company describes as its \u201cchief innovation evangelist\u201d, a Harvard lecturer and \u201cmaverick scientist\u201d Tessa Forshaw, and Meredith Caldwell, a \u201cstrategic vision clairvoyant\u201d who opts for the plainer title of \u201chead of engagement\u201d on her LinkedIn profile. The company says it will deliver two workshops, plus an eight-week course and a 14-week course, along with coaching and a research study under the contract. The foreign affairs department is also hosting two sessions delivered free of charge by Braden and Forshaw , titled \u201cInnovative resilience: thriving in systemic failure\u201d on 17 July and \u201cInnovation-ish tools for leading through ambiguity\u201d on 24 July, an \u201cexecutive masterclass\u201d for senior executive service and \u201cambitious\u201d executive level two public servants. \u201cInnovationish\u201d describes the desirability of developing a creative mindset directed towards innovation but attenuates it, suggesting even efforts that fall short of true innovation are worthwhile. According to the foreign affairs department event description, People Rocket\u2019s approach \u201crecognises that innovation is a scale and not a destination; and that small shifts along the scale can have a huge impact\u201d. The three-hour session promises public servants they will experience \u201cinnovation-ish mindsets and moves to deliver differently in your systems\u201d. \u201cMindsets focus on how you think about the work you need to do. Moves are the actions you take to move the work forward.\u201d The masterclass suggests it can help executive leaders deal with scenarios such as: \u201cTomorrow, from home, you need to handle a global pandemic and a critical lack of supplies as millions of people get sick or lose their jobs. No playbook. No checklist. No precedent. The solution \u2013 analogical reasoning.\u201d The masterclass was also linked to Australia\u2019s pandemic response by the industry department\u2019s public sector innovation network and the Institute of Public Administration Australia. Both explained that the masterclass formed part of \u201cinnovation month\u201d which was themed \u201c\u2018delivering differently\u2019, reflecting the public sector\u2019s outcomes-focused response to the Covid-19 pandemic\u201d. In June foreign affairs awarded a 12-month A$130,776 contract to People Rocket for education and training services, through limited tender, \u201cdue to an absence of competition for technical reasons\u201d. In June Asic awarded People Rocket a 12-month A$50,000 contract, by limited tender because of a \u201cneed for specialised or professional skills\u201d. The industry department reported in August 2019 that Braden and Forshaw recently \u201cflew from the US to help a room full of Australian public servants\u201d with training involving the \u201cinnovation(ish)\u201d method. The industry department statement about the training explained that the six innovation(ish) mindsets are: interaction, insight, ideation, iteration, inspiration and implementation. Each mindset is described with a parenthetical phrase giving examples common to the policymaking process such as \u201cdiscover real human needs\u201d and \u201c[consider] the feasibility of deploying ideas in the real world\u201d. \u201cTessa and Rich\u2019s innovation(ish) approach lowers the barrier to entry and expands access to useful, helpful, design tools,\u201d the department\u2019s website said, preventing innovation from becoming \u201csomething that only people with designer glasses and hipster shoes were allowed to do\u201d. \u201cAs Rich said \u2018you do the innovation things, but you don\u2019t say you\u2019re doing the innovation things\u2019.\u201d An industry department spokesperson said it had \u201cno commercial contract\u201d with Braden and Forshaw, who were already in Australia, and received domestic travel, one night of accommodation and lunch but were not paid to deliver the workshop. The workshop, attended by about 80 people from 16 public service agencies, taught \u201cleading-edge innovation techniques and tools\u201d. A spokesman for Asic directed questions to foreign affairs, explaining that Asic was \u201cone of a group of agencies, [which] decided to leverage off Dfat\u2019s procurement process to establish its component of the contract with People Rocket\u201d. He did not cite specific outcomes for the 12-month training contract because \u201cthe program has only just commenced\u201d. Asked to define innovationish, the spokesman replied: \u201cA mindsets-first approach (to innovation): to gain access to, and continued use of, a learning and experiential engagement pedagogy for developing and/or accelerating innovative mindsets, and strategic innovation change management.\u201d Guardian Australia has contacted the foreign affairs department for comment. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 July 2020 to clarify that the two masterclasses planned for July were being delivered by Rich Cox Braden and Tessa Forshaw, acting in an individual capacity and at no cost to the APS. Details of training activities to be delivered under contract by People Rocket were also added. The headline was amended because the original said that the government had spent $230,000 on \u201cinnovationish training\u201d; this total was based on government tender notices that incorrectly stated another company, Gilimbaa Pty Ltd, was also contracted for this type of training. The figure has been corrected and reference to Gilimbaa removed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
