A schoolboy had been asked to write a short monologue and present it to his drama class. Sixteen days later he was in jail. He would be there for 34 days, for his 16th birthday, for Christmas, for new year. The writing community was immediately up in arms. His right to freedom of expression had been violated, and they wanted to do something about it. Last Sunday they congregated in Ottawa, at a fundraising event called Artists for Freedom of Speech. Michael Ondaatje, whose first novel Billy the Kid was about a young killer, spoke.\"It was full of violence, but somehow I learned to keep it there. I see myself as someone who was saved by writing.\" Margaret Atwood spoke. \"Childhood can be hell,\" she said, quoting The Untouched Key by Alice Miller. \"One reason childhood can be hell is that as a child you can have no power, you can have no recourse and nobody who will actually believe you if you did go so far as to express, in one way or another, something that happened to you.\" She gave the boy a book, First Words, a collection of early writing by well known authors. Even Stephen King weighed in, telling the Toronto Globe and Mail: \"I am in total solidarity with that young man and admire him because it shows again that the imagination is the most powerful force on earth.\" Ondaatje and Atwood aren't commenting now, though. And there's a feeling that they, and the other 13 writers who read at the event, might have been a little rash. That the case might be more complicated than they initially thought. That it has less to do with free expression than they'd like, and that not enough people went to the school to find out what was actually going on. They would have discovered, among other things, that disciplinary action was taken because of an alleged series of death threats, rather than as a direct result of his monologue. \"Was he arrested for reading his monologue in class? In my view, no,\" says Frank MacEachern, the crime reporter for the local newspaper, the Cornwall Standard-Freeholder. He attended the boy's bail hearing. \"If he hadn't allegedly made threats to three students in the school, I doubt the police would have been involved.\" The boy, who cannot be named under Canadian law because of his age, had only been at Tagwi secondary school in Avonmore, Ontario, for a couple of months when this flared up. It's a small, rural school of about 500 students. In interviews with Canadian papers, and a written account of the event that he released to papers, the boy says that he was bullied soon after he arrived. (The family was not answering calls last night.) \"People would make fun of me, my family, my possessions and my actions/words. One thing I remember quite clearly is one boy saying 'Can you say \"The rat ran over the river across the road?\" ' If you notice there are seven Rs in that one sentence. I have difficulty saying one R (this is my shameful secret which until now I would deny impetuously) which turn out sounding like a W or an O (due to an inability of my mouth).\" Some of the writers in Ottawa, for instance novelist Elizabeth Harvor, did focus on the serious issue of bullying in schools, citing the fact that the boy claimed to have been, on one occasion, so severely beaten up that he went home bloody. His classmates, however, have a slightly different story. They admit he was probably taunted, but Marty Partridge, a Grade 11 student who was in the drama class when the boy presented his monologue, says: \"To start he was just some other kid. But then he started to make himself more noticeable ... He would go around making things up, saying that some kids were ugly and dirty and stuff like that. He walked around by himself a lot of the time.\" November 22 was the last of four sessions in which students presented monologues they had written. Each session had been followed by a critique by students and class, and so far he had not done well. Once he had even plagiarised Stephen King, changing the names, but effectively passing off The Boogeyman from Night Shift as his own work. The youth has told the media that there were four assigned categories that he could choose from, fantasy, tragedy, comedy and horror. But Cory Lafave, another student in the drama class, says this is pure fabrication; students could write about anything they chose. The youth, who has a black goatee and whispy hair, and is about 5ft3in and slightly stubby, stood up in front of the class and delivered the monologue with what Partridge describes as a smirk. And the script that has since been released, Partridge adds, isn't exactly what the class heard. \"He ad-libbed a lot. Like he said that if anyone tried to get out they'd walk up to the front door and he'd shoot them between the eyes with a shotgun. \"The object of a monologue is to get people's attention and get them to hear what you want to say, at the edge of their seat wanting to hear the rest. And he did that. He had me. He totally wrote a good monologue. That was just a good piece of theatre.\" The drama teacher agreed, praising the effort, rather than censuring it. It seems that after this there were more alleged death threats. People started talking about the monologue, asking if there was a hit list, allegedly learning that there was, and that there were three specific people inplicated. His defence counsel, Frank Horn, says that everything is rumour, that hysteria snowballed and the allegations of threats are unfounded, that nothing can be pinned down. That his client is being persecuted by students jealous of someone \"who might make it\". \"My guy is innocent.\" Be that as it may, much of the school, with an eye to the \"12:12\" mentioned in the monologue, had decided not to attend on December 12. The police were called in. He was arrested on Friday December 8, and would not be released until January 9. While he was in jail, his 14-year-old brother had charges laid against him for allegedly making death threats at a different school, and his two older sisters, who ran away from home, alleged to the Ottawa Citizen that it was their brother who was often the bully. During that time, in the arts community and among civil rights activists, support for the boy was growing quickly. PEN (the Canadian branch of the writers' association) got involved. Clayton Ruby, one of the most famous criminal lawyers in Canada, asked to take over the case. The International Writers Festival organised Sunday's rally. But by the time the rally occurred, writers were backtracking. Broadcaster Laurier Lapierre, who has suffered bona fide censorship, even said: \"At the beginning of this great drama, it seemed so simple. Now it is no longer so clear.\" The boy, who attended in a Pink Panther tie, was meant to read his story to the 400-strong crowd, but didn't. More measured, thoughtful voices are now beginning to be heard too. There are issues here that go beyond saving face, beyond misjudgments. The first is, of course, the very real issue of freedom of speech. If the case comes to trial (for four alleged threats) in September, and it's discovered that the boy was disciplined because of real threats to the safety of the school, then PEN Canada and the writers who ranged themselves for him risk trivialising censorship. Secondly, the writing in the monologue is OK - but, as award-winning children's author Tim Wynne-Jones puts it, anyone who's worked with young people has seen writing like it before. Wynne-Jones was scheduled to speak in Ottawa, but dropped out because he was concerned about all these things, concerned that it wasn't really an issue of the freedom of speech.\"I was particularly concerned about the boy, that he would confuse notoriety with talent.\" The funds collected are to go towards getting him into a creative writing program. The rest will go to supporting programs that put artists in contract with students. \"I think he needs tutors; if he were to sit down and read the books of the people who stood up and spoke, he'd be a lot smarter than he was a month ago. I do feel sorry for what he's had to go through. I hope he's not left out in the cold now all this has blown over. I don't think any of the writers who were there on Sunday will be inviting him over for tea.\" 'Twisted': the story that landed its writer in jail There's this boy who's been harassed and tortured all his life until he was at the brink of insanity and sanity. His entire life has been one test after another: testing his patience, his sanity, emotions and morals. Without rest there was always someone on his back, teachers, principals, but most of all the other students. I could go on talking about their hatred for him for no specific reason other than they wanted to. His teachers cheated him, tricked him and despised him, and why not they had their pets. Teachers always have their pets and their toys. No matter how much they preached about not having any. The toys were good for playing with then discarding, the pets you pampered looking mostly at their good points and getting attached. The principals well they didn't plain just like him. But it's the students I think that did it; yeah definitely, it was the students that warped him. No matter how hard he tried there was always something wrong with him in their minds. He tried and tried he really did. He wanted to be just like them at first, well up until Grade 7 that is. Then he came to terms with his life and realised that he didn't fit in. In Grade 9 he began to like being different, being an outcast, he liked the dumb comments, because by then they weren't at him but rather at someone on the outside. Somehow during all this he had slowly and steadily retreated from the world, putting up barriers and shields, so many in fact that he saw the patterns of the fabric of life, saw all the little holes and tears, gimmicks and faults. He discovered what life is: pain. When you live something else is in pain. When you eat something had to go through pain to be there for you to eat, even base feeling is little shocks being shot up the nerves. Every action, thought and creation is borne on pain. Any ways one day he went to class in a bad mood, he had been pushed really hard that day. This was supposedly his favourite class, but it had been the hardest on him, his projects were all considered pieces of crap, his classmates of course loved him as always. Apparently this class had been set-up that day. Oh what fun they had that day poking and prodding and pushing and pulling. And of course who said \"Boo,\" no one that's who. I supposed they had no clue what he was thinking about because I'm sure that if they did they would have backed off really, really quickly. The next day he came to school he was super happy, bouncing along in a hyper/jovial mood, he laughed at the stupid jokes pretending not knowing they were insults. He was buddy buddy with the teachers. Oh just the best of moods. I guess that no one knew that he had woken up at 5.00 in the morning and jimmied the lock on one of the back doors. In addition, that in his bag he was carrying 13 packages of C-4 and a detonater. I guess he had fun stashing them under the garbage bags in the pails, 4 packages under the tables in the cafeteria, mostly in high traffic areas. Apparently he kept one strapped to his chest just in case the others were found. Luckily for him none were found. Everyone blissfully unaware that their lives were in very imminent danger. He went happily along waiting for the right moment. He decided to detonate at 12:12 exactly. Everyone would be having lunch and having fun."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
