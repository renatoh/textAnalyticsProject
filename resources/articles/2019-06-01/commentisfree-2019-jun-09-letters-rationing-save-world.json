Rationing might\u201d, Comment). In relation to what Sodha calls climate hypocrisy, it is worth noting that, according to a wartime Home Intelligence report from May 1942, the British public showed \u201ca complete and expressed unwillingness to make voluntary sacrifices, but an apparent readiness to face compulsory sacrifices without undue grumbling\u201d. However, Sodha suggests that we modernise rationing, introducing a market and allocating \u201cpolluting credits\u201d allowing people to buy and sell rations. But would this be an improvement? Arguably, the rejection of markets, and a commitment to fair shares, is precisely what made rationing attractive to the general public in the 1940s. A report from 1941 stated: \u201cAs long as people believe that all classes and sections are suffering and enduring equally, they will put up with very great hardship. It is \u2018unfairness\u2019 that people resent.\u201d Either way, Sodha\u2019s suggestion that rationing would be better than a carbon tax is supported by the historian Mark Roodhouse, who argued that rationing would be more effective than a carbon tax if a government needed \u201cto reduce carbon emissions quickly and dramatically\u201d. Rob Lawlor Leeds Poor nations need nurses too Michael Savage has only considered the UK\u2019s need for additional nurses, not whether poorer countries can afford to lose their nurses (\u201cPlan to hire thousands of foreign nurses for NHS is axed\u201d, News). I lived and worked in South Africa, mainly in townships, and was shocked the first time I saw a full page ad from a private British medical recruitment company for doctors and nurses to work in the NHS. The vast majority of the white population in South Africa have medical insurance and are treated in state-of-the-art hospitals. The vast majority of non-white people live in townships and only the largest townships have a public hospital that does not demand money up front. The difference in medical treatment can be summed up by the fact that one private hospital in Johannesburg has more gynaecologists than the whole of the province of Limpopo. The depressing truth is that the UK does not train enough nurses or doctors and expects poorer countries to do the training for it. Michael Gold Romford, Essex Politicians and \u2018the truth\u2019 I understand Kenan Malik writing of the risks if the law were to be the judge of the lies of canvassing politicians (\u201cDemocracy is the victim if the law starts to police politics\u201d, Comment). But when is a lie not a lie? Only after a politician is elected? At some time, the law might be all we have. In an era when politicians have subdued our public broadcaster and we are alarmed at the dishonesty of overseas elected leaders, should we not be more careful about politicians here subverting their democratic licence? William Steele Bishop\u2019s Stortford, Herts More PE is essential \u201cAusterity\u201d in the form of cuts in school budgets and to the school sports partnerships programme may have contributed to the reduction in the time pupils spend in PE (\u201cAusterity cuts are blamed for 130,000 preventable deaths\u201d, News). The evidence suggests, however, that by far the most significant cause is the increased pressure on schools to produce good exam results in the core subjects. Even in the more limited time that students are in PE lessons, there is a growing tendency to pull them out for extra tuition in core subjects. At a time when, due to their excessive use of electronic devices, young people lead a more sedentary lifestyle and childhood obesity is on the rise, it is a national disgrace that young people\u2019s opportunity for physical activity at school has been so severely cut back. Chris Pratt Adel, Leeds When history became history In his perceptive article on the historical amnesia that is creating a Britain that is an \u201cunreal land of distorted memories\u201d, David Olusoga refers to the \u201cfog of historical amnesia\u201d that hangs heavily over postwar history (\u201cBritain can\u2019t be reborn while we\u2019re still lost in fantasies about the past\u201d, Comment). However, it has to be said that planned ignorance of British history, including recent history, has also played a key role in producing so many amnesiacs and part of the blame for this lies at the door of Kenneth Clarke MP. When Clarke was secretary of state for education and science from 1990-1992, the National Curriculum Council history task group was trying to slim down the content of the curriculum. Clarke decided to make history optional beyond the age of 14 and to rule out the study of events in the previous 20 years from the history curriculum. He was doing the country no favours by building ignorance of history into the education system, for it has helped to form the fantasy view of British history that sustains the case for Brexit. David Head Peterborough My explosive wartime birth Unlike Richard Norton-Taylor, I was not born on D-day but 20 days later, my arrival precipitated by Mother\u2019s shock at a V-1 flying bomb explosion in the grounds of her Croydon maternity hospital, which brought the ceiling down on her bed (\u201cI was a D-day baby but at least I wasn\u2019t called Dwight\u201d, Comment). Six weeks later, she saved our lives by upending my pram in the porchway of a house as a Messerschmitt 109 pilot began strafing us. All this was happening while her husband was away serving in the RAF. David J Savage South Ockendon, Essex Unfair visa system is wrong The UK government\u2019s biased immigration policy is undermining \u201cglobal Britain\u2019s\u201d reputation and efforts to tackle challenges including climate breakdown, poverty, disease outbreaks and conflict. As leaders of organisations, institutions and programmes that are striving to strengthen the UK\u2019s position as a science, research and development world leader, we continue to be extremely concerned that growing numbers of African partners are being refused entry to the UK. A recent report from the All Party Parliamentary Group on Africa highlighted that the number of UK visa refusals for nationals of African countries is twice the rate of those from any other part of the world. The UK Government International Research and Innovation Strategy states: \u201cThe importance of global co-operation to find solutions and to drive our long-term prosperity has never been greater.\u201d TThis co-operation must extend to all countries and regions. It is vital to delivering life-saving work such as helping to bring an end to the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, to ensuring that taxpayers\u2019 money makes a tangible difference and to promoting the UK as a venue for cutting-edge global debates. We must have a fair and equitable visa system that promotes and protects the essential collaborations that mean we can tackle today\u2019s global challenges as well as the unknown challenges of the future.

And one that costs only 4.8p a mile to run. But hang on, it costs how much? \u00a358,500. By what magical reckoning does it cost only 4.8 per mile? Oh, I see, you\u2019ve omitted the cost of the vehicle and its likely depreciation from your calculations. Fair enough.
