Truth be told, the Rumours have always been fond of a punt, and if someone was prepared to offer us half-decent odds against uncompromising ball-winner Claude Makelele leaving Chelsea at the end of the season we'd snap their hand off. According to today's Mirror, the Congo born French midfielder has failed to settle in London and is struggling to overcome the language barrier. Go n'eiri an bothar leath, Claude. Meanwhile in a decidedly less salubrious part of London, Arsenal and Tottenham look set to engage in a tug-of-love battle for Mark van Bommel. The PSV Eindhoven midfielder has already declared his lack of ambition by issuing a come-and-get-me-plea to Spurs, but may change his tune when he hears Arsene Wenger has been giving him the glad eye. Any midsummer move to Highbury would be funded by the \u00a36m Atletico Madrid are prepared to shell out to take Gilberto Silva off Arsenal's hands. Another man who famously likes a bet is Michael Owen, whose lethargy in front of goal has cost him his chance of securing that \u00a325m move to Real Madrid he's always fancied. According to your super, soaraway Sun, the feeling among Real chiefs is that Owen would not generate enough excitement among the fans if he was their star signing this summer. And while it's difficult to believe that someone blessed with a personality as charismatic as L'il Mickey's wouldn't get Real fans all moist with anticipation, the Rumour Mill is reliably informed that the mug punter other mug punters call The Guv'nor has fallen behind Thierry Henry, Ruud van Nistelrooy, David Trezeguet, Francesco Totti, a deluxe mitten dryer, and a Cedar Tool Shed on Madrid president Florentino Perez's wish-list. And finally, Matias Vuoso is set to become Kevin Keegan's most expensive mistake as he brings his two-year Manchester City hell to an end. The Argentina striker has featured in no Premiership games whatsoever since Keegan paid \u00a34m for him to Independiete in June 2002. Normally we'd laugh at Kev's misfortune, but with Cheltenham still fresh in the memory, the Rumour Mill knows all about expensive mistakes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
