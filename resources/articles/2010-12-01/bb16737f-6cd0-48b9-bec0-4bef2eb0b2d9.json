Apart from the Vaughan Williams Stevenson cycle, Hopkins concentrates on little-known settings \u2013 few on this side of the Atlantic will know the eight highly wrought songs to poems by Richard Outram that make up South of North \u2013 Images of Canada by Srul Irving Glick (1934-2002), while neither Paul Bowles's lovely Blue Mountain Ballads, with their mix of slightly faded lyricism and folksy Americana, nor Samuel Barber's Op 45 songs, all settings of one poet's translations of another, are heard as often as they deserve to be. Hopkins delivers them all with such care and attention to their meaning that it seems churlish to want a bit more variation in colour from his singing. Perhaps, too, a bit more musical variety would have made a difference: it's all just a little too samey, and dipping in to the disc rather than playing it straight through might be the best approach."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
