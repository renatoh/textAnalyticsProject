Marc Burrows, 25, scored the goal for Cowes Sports against Eastleigh Reserves in a Wessex League match on April 3. The FA gave its confirmation after receiving a match report from referee John Sorrell. \"We can now say that Marc's goal is the fastest we are aware of,\" the FA statement said. \"Two-and-a-half seconds may not seem long enough to complete the maneouvre described by the referee but we appreciate there was an exceptionally strong wind.\" Burrows, a former trainee with Portsmouth, said he took advantage of the wind and aimed a long ball towards the goal with the very first kick of the game. \"The wind was so strong I thought it was worth a go,\" Burrows explained. \"The ball just sailed over their poor 'keeper. I was so stunned I didn't really celebrate. I just put my hands in the air and burst out laughing.\" Burrows said he would contact the Guinness Book of Records to get his achievement in the next edition. The world's fastest goal listed by the book is 2.8 seconds and was scored by Argentine Ricardo Olivera for Rio Negro against Soriano in 1998. The previous fastest goal in Britain was held by Colin Cowperthwaite, who scored in 3.5 seconds for Barrow against Kettering in the Conference in 1979. The fastest goal in the Premiership was scored by Spurs' Ledley King against Bradford in 2000 after just 10 seconds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
