Athar Finjan Saddam Abdullah was giving evidence against seven members of the Parachute Regiment accused of murdering another man caught up in the alleged assault. Mr Saddam Abdullah told the hearing he was working as a taxi driver after hostilities ceased in May 2003 when he and his friend, Nadhem Abdullah, 18, were stopped with others by a British military patrol. As he prepared to hand over the vehicle's registration documents, he said he was attacked by the soldiers whom he had seen chasing other cars across the desert moments before. Before he could explain who he was, he said, he and his companion were beaten to the floor and left unconscious. Mr Abdullah died from head injuries before his family could hire a car to take him to hospital in Basra. The soldiers from the Third Battalion Parachute Regiment allegedly used their rifle butts, helmets, fists and feet during the attack while the men lay helpless on the ground. Mr Saddam Abdullah spoke through an Iraqi interpreter at the hearing at Colchester Garrison, Essex, as he described seeing two British military trucks with fixed rifles chasing a pair of white pickup trucks moments before they surrounded his car. He told the court he had been dropping off his uncle's wife in the village of al-Firkar in Maysan province, north of Basra. \"We both got out of the car when they approached us. They were angry ... nobody spoke to us. One came and immediately started beating me ... after that they all came and started to beat us, both me and my friend ... They were angry, they were nervous, beating us ... I never fought back, I thought I should respect them.\" Mr Saddam Abdullah is one of seven Iraqi witnesses flown to the UK to give evidence against the British soldiers. All seven deny murder and violent disorder. Their duties at the time were to protect civilians from the armed men said to be roaming the area and crossing the border from Iran after hostilities had ended. The Maysan province was described as \"very dangerous indeed\", with no effective Iraqi police force and the British authorities, based in the old police station of nearby Al U'Zayra, were the only means of controlling the area. The soldiers also operated checkpoints on the look out for people smuggling weapons, cash or other contraband. Nothing illegal was found in Mr Saddam Abdullah's truck, which he had been using to ferry people between neighbouring villages and to the local market. In a packed courtroom and in front of a jury of seven military officers, Mr Saddam Abdullah at one point rolled up his shirt sleeves to show scars from the attack more than two years ago. He bent over in the witness box to point out where he had been beaten in the lower back. Photographs showing his bruises were also handed to the court. Earlier, the prosecutor, Martin Heslop QC, said the six privates and a corporal were guilty of an unjustified assault in which two women and two brothers who had been in the vehicle were injured. The brothers allegedly left the scene but were tracked down and beaten by the soldiers. The women, one of whom was pregnant, were hit in the face and on the head, it was claimed. Mr Heslop said: \"We say this was not a case of soldiers responding whilst under attack or of soldiers requiring to defend themselves in operational engagement. It was nothing more than gratuitous violence meted out to innocent and unarmed Iraqi civilians. The crown's case is that the assault was unjustified and unprovoked.\" The soldiers, Corporal Scott Evans, 32, Privates Billy Nerney, 24, Samuel May, 25 and Morne Vosloo, 26, and ex-privates Daniel Harding, 25, Scott Jackson, 26, and Roberto Di-Gregorio, 24, who have now left the army, also allegedly killed a dog. Other Iraqi witnesses are expected to testify that the men were seen laughing, clapping their hands and shouting \"Ali Baba\" before smashing the windows and slashing the tyres on Mr Saddam Abdullah's truck. The soldiers are accused under the Army Act and deny jointly murdering Nadhem Abdullah on May 11 2003 as well as one count of violent disorder."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
