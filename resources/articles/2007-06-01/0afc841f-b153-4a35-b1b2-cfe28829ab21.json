Robson, who took over as manager from Neil Warnock last month after the Blades' agonising relegation from the Premiership, had hoped to keep the England B international after he excelled during the south Yorkshire team's short stay in the top flight but the 24-year-old, who can play in defence or midfield and even had a spell in goal in the 1-0 win over Arsenal, has attracted the attention of several Premiership clubs and it appears inevitable he will leave Bramall Lane after eight years with the club. Robson said: \"Keeping Phil looks like it is going to be a problem. He's told me that if possible he would rather stay in the Premiership, providing it's the best thing for both him and the club. My job now looks like it's going to be trying to ensure we get the best deal possible.\" Sammy Lee is determined to prevent Bolton Wanderers' leading players following his predecessor Sam Allardyce out of the club. The new manager will be concerned at reports linking Bolton's record signing Nicolas Anelka with a move to Manchester United and he is also trying to persuade the defender Tal Ben Haim and goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen to sign new deals. \"We don't want to lose our best players,\" said Lee. \"Bolton Wanderers is a forward-thinking club, envied across the game. It is my job to keep a healthy camp with the desire to be successful. The chairman is in the process of talking to current players so we can tie them up on long-term deals.\" Ben Haim's contract expires at the end of the month but Lee has not given up hope of persuading the 25-year-old Israel international to sign on. \"I have spoken to Tal and have nothing but admiration for the lad in the way he has handled himself in difficult circumstances this year with all the speculation,\" he said. \"I don't know whether he is going to come back to us. The ball is in his court and it will be up to him now. The club has made him an offer and, after the internationals in June, he will make a decision on where he wants to go. \" Jaaskelainen is about to enter the final year of his current contract and has been linked with a move to Sunderland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
