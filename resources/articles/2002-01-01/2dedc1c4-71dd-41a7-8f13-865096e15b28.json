The club owner Sam Hammam, who attracted widespread criticism after he left his seat in the second half to walk around the pitch, was formally warned about his conduct, though he last week promised never to repeat the act. Cardiff were charged with misconduct following a joint investigation between the FAW and the Football Association. The FA has the power to take further action after its Welsh counterpart has concluded its hearing. The Welsh club have 10 days in which to respond to the charge after which the FAW will set up a commission to hear the case. Hammam was unavailable for comment last night, but earlier this week he said that Cardiff should not be held responsible for fans who threw objects on to the pitch. Fifteen Cardiff supporters appeared in court this week to answer charges of hooliganism. One of them was a former player of the club, Dai Thomas. The 26-year old, who admitted using threatening language and who will be sentenced next month, has been banned from playing in the Welsh amateur league. Thomas has also been threatened with a life ban from Ninian Park. Nottingham Forest, \u00a320m in debt, are willing to sell the \u00a35m-rated Jermaine Jenas to remain afloat - as the entrepreneur Nigel Doughty ploughs in a similar amount to purchase more shares in the club. Doughty has already invested \u00a36m in Forest and has guaranteed a \u00a36m loan at the bank. His latest injection will see his shareholding rise from 40% to between 80 and 90% and he could take over as chairman from Eric Barnes. Walsall yesterday signed the Birmingham defender David Holdsworth on loan for a month while the Bradford manager Nicky Law failed with a \u00a3225,000 bid to sign the defender Ian Breckin and the forward Jamie Burt from his former club Chesterfield. The Northampton Town Supporters Trust, the first of its kind in the country, will celebrate its 10th anniversary tomorrow. A group of Northampton fans formed the trust in January 1992 when their club was in danger of going out of business. There are now 42 trusts in existence at other clubs in Britain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
