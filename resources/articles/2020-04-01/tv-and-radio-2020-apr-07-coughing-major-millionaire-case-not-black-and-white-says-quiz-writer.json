The British army major was convicted alongside his wife, Diana, after a court ruled that he won the \u00a31m prize in 2001 with help from a fellow contestant, Tecwen Whittock, using a series of strategic coughs to indicate the correct answer. In an interview with Radio Times, the writer James Graham said the fact the couple were \u201crelatively privileged, white and middle class\u201d made them \u201cperfect tabloid fodder\u201d for people to project hatred towards. \u201cObviously all three were found guilty,\u201d Graham said. \u201cBut the story isn\u2019t as clear cut as the majority of people think. Whether they did it or they didn\u2019t do it, I think what happened in the studio that night isn\u2019t black and white. There is new evidence and other older evidence that hasn\u2019t really been presented to the public before and it points towards the Ingrams\u2019 innocence.\u201d Graham, who has adapted his play Quiz into a drama for ITV starring Matthew Macfadyen and Sian Clifford, said the Ingrams and Whittock never spent any time together and had only had one eight-minute phone call before the show. \u201cHe\u2019s in the military, so there\u2019s an air of privilege around them but also, maybe, gullibility, or innocence and naivety,\u201d added Graham. \u201cAnd that makes them ripe for the media to enjoy putting them in the stocks and throwing vegetables at them. I think one of the things we want to question is whether the mockery and humiliation they endured was proportionate to what they were accused of doing. A million pounds is serious, of course, but it\u2019s also just a game. Nobody died.\u201d He said Whittock\u2019s cough was a result of an asthmatic condition. \u201cWould you pick someone who has an uncontrollable cough to cough at specific moments, during a really tense gameshow? Maybe you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Graham. The Peaky Blinders actor Helen McCrory, who features in Quiz as Sonia Woodley QC, the lawyer who defended Ingram, said she too felt uncertainty about the scandal. \u201cThe fact that a lot of people at the time didn\u2019t hear the cough \u2026 Chris Tarrant didn\u2019t hear the cough, the person sitting opposite didn\u2019t hear the cough, people either side didn\u2019t hear the cough, yet for some reason he [Ingram] heard the cough,\u201d she told the Mirror. During his appearance on the quiz show, which aired in September 2001, Ingram at times wavered between possible answers, appearing to settle on one before switching to another. After he won, the show\u2019s production company, Celador, suspended payment of the prize after accusing him and his wife of defrauding the show along with Whittock. Following a trial at Southwark crown court in 2003, the three defendants were convicted by a majority verdict and given suspended sentences and fined. Ingram was later forced to resign his commission as a major by the army board. Ingram was denied leave to appeal against his conviction in 2004. Graham\u2019s three-part drama Quiz starts on ITV on Monday 13 April."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
