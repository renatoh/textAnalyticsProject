Mr Howard is not due to step down until the end of the year. The party will decide on procedures for electing a new leader at conference in September, after which the contest will take place. Some have seen that as leaving the Tories on the backfoot during the summer, but today Mr Howard said the party had rushed into leadership contests in 1997 and 2001 without tangible benefits. Interviewed on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, he said he was determined to \"create a space for the kind of discussion and the debate which the Conservative party hasn't had in recent years. We need a period of time in which to think about the direction of the party, the best way forward for the party. \"You can't have that kind of discussion in the context of a leadership race, it gets bound up with the personalities of the candidates. You certainly can't have it when a new leader is in place because then anybody expressing a different view is running the risk of being accused of being disloyal to the leader. \"So I have said I am going to go, no one need worry about being disloyal to me. Let's have a full and frank and uninhibited discussion about the future direction of the party, then let's see if we can introduce some sensible changes to the rules, and then we will move in an orderly way to a leadership contest.\" Mr Howard was asked what he would say to any Tory backbenchers who might be contemplating petitioning Sir Michael Spicer, chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, for an early leadership contest. Mr Howard said: \"That is their privilege. What I have done is to set out a timetable which I believe is in the best interests of the party. That's why I'm doing it. \"I could have resigned immediately and we could have had an immediate leadership contest. I was being urged on all sides not to do that. That is what happened after the 1997 election, that's what happened after the 2001 election. \"People said let's not have that again, let's have a space in which we can reflect, in which we can talk about the best way forward for the party. I think that is right, I think that is in the best interests of the party. That is why I have set out the timetable I have.\" Earlier this week backbenchers rejected Mr Howard's preferred proposals for a new leadership contest procedure, choosing instead to back a formula under which Tory MPs would have the decisive say, with party activists, peers and MEPs restricted to a consultative role only. That plan has yet to be adopted formally by the party. With the rules for the contest still to be decided, no candidate has formally declared their intentions, but a large field has opened up, with many potential runners giving speeches or raising their media profiles over the past month. They include David Cameron, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, Kenneth Clarke, Tim Yeo, Theresa May, David Willetts and Liam Fox, although the current shadow home secretary, David Davis, is the frontrunner with the bookmakers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
