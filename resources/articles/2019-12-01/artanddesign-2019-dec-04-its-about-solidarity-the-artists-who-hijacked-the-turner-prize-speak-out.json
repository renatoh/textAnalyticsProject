The Turner prize nominees had arrived in Margate to visit the Turner Contemporary. The four artists \u2013 Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock, Oscar Murillo, Tai Shani \u2013 had never met before and, as they talked in a white-walled meeting room facing the North Sea, they began to discuss proposing themselves to the judges as a collective. Their idea was, in other words, that there should be no single winner of this year\u2019s Turner prize. It was a plan for a hijack \u2013 albeit, says Cammock, \u201ca considered hijack\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t remember who said it out loud first,\u201d says Shani, whose sensuous, voluptuous work for the prize\u2019s exhibition combines performance, text and installation to imagine a post-patriarchal world. \u201cWe\u2019d all thought about it. For me, it felt like being nominated was a huge recognition. I was really happy with that. When someone suggested it, we were very cohesive immediately.\u201d Murillo \u2013 who is showing an unsettling installation of papier-mache figures staring out to sea, their view all but blocked by a dark curtain \u2013 says: \u201cIf any of us had individually won, I would have felt I was betraying my own work and ideas \u2013 if we are indeed really talking about solidarity.\u201d Abu Hamdan quickly understood that although his fellow shortlisted artists use very different aesthetic tools from him, they have much in common \u2013 an interest in power and agency, exclusion and oppression. \u201cIf anyone gets what we do as individual artists, they will get why this decision had to be made,\u201d he says. His films in the show arise from a project to collect aural memories from survivors of the infamous Saydnaya prison in Syria \u2013 memories that in practical terms helped researchers reconstruct the conditions of incarceration but also, in their distortions and metaphorical layerings, allowed the artist to mine a deeper, poetic understanding of these horrific experiences. \u201cThere was something about the way we work and why we work that resonated,\u201d remembers Cammock, who is showing a film about women\u2019s resistance and protest in Derry during the Troubles. \u201cWe started to talk about the toxic political environment and it felt like it was a moment we could start doing something about that, between us \u2013 however that worked or manifested.\u201d As their eventual joint statement puts it, they believed that pitting themselves against each other \u201cwould undermine our individual artistic efforts to show a world entangled. The issues we each deal with are as inseparable as climate chaos is from capitalism.\u201d Proposing themselves as a collective, as an act of resistance, would be a symbolic gesture. Symbolism is, of course, the great tool of the artist \u2013 and the Turner prize, for the British artist, is the most prominent platform from which to deploy it. This coup was, says Shani, \u201cactually quite a bureaucratic process. We didn\u2019t have very high hopes of it going through. This idea of Mutiny on the Bounty \u2013 that wasn\u2019t quite how it panned out.\u201d They made a proposal to Tate Britain, which runs the prize, in the summer and it wound its way up to the trustees before being offered to the jurors as an option. They weren\u2019t at all sure it would be accepted. The jurors met as usual on Tuesday, the day of the announcement, and were free to ignore what the artists had suggested \u2013 though realistically, there wasn\u2019t much moral wriggle-room. So they accepted and the artists will split the prize money equally, \u00a310,000 each. At the prize ceremony, in Margate\u2019s art deco Dreamland amusement park, Cammock read the full statement \u2013 the most political Turner prize speech in years, a sustained attack on the Conservatives\u2019 politics of austerity and exclusion. To slam the point home, Shani was sporting an enormous pendant bearing the slogan: \u201cTORIES OUT.\u201d She talked of an increasingly narrow idea of \u201cBritishness\u201d offered by the right. As Abu Hamdan put it the morning after: \u201cThere\u2019s a disconnect between being accepted as a British artist culturally \u2013 and being put on the highest platform of what it means to be a British artist \u2013 and the \u2018hostile environment\u2019.\u201d This feels personal to all of them. Abu Hamdan has a British passport but lives in Beirut partly because of the difficulties of settling his Lebanese wife in Britain. Murillo, who was born in Colombia, once flushed his British passport down an aeroplane loo in a moment of rebellion against the privilege the document confers. Shani, who is Jewish, talks about how she feels \u201cantisemitism has been manipulated by the right. There\u2019s a feeling that you are being instrumentalised and that people are speaking on behalf of your identity in the name of protecting you.\u201d Cammock feels that the current climate of division and racism is \u201ca resurgence of something toxically dangerous, like a wave that keeps rising\u201d. Should artists be getting into this kind of territory? Well, why not? All art is political. But the other point these artists press home is that they also live in the real world. Their work is not magically disconnected from their lives and opinions, and the society in which they live. \u201cI\u2019ve been vocal about my financial precarity,\u201d says Shani, who has posted on social media about how she\u2019s feared having to give up working as an artist because of the difficulty of making ends meet. \u201cPeople ask me,\u201d chips in Cammock, \u201cabout how the arts can become more inclusive spaces for people who don\u2019t come from wealthy backgrounds. But art isn\u2019t isolated from society. If people are excluded from other things, they will also be excluded from the arts.\u201d Shani continues: \u201cIf people aren\u2019t paid properly in the arts then people can\u2019t be artists.\u201d Cammock: \u201cAnd if it\u2019s being taken out of state education and becomes something for privileged private schools.\u201d Shani: \u201cThen there\u2019s higher education, tuition fees. Everything is related. We are part of society.\u201d You could reasonably ask: if the artists had been so eager to disrupt the rules of the Turner prize, why did they allow their nominations to go forward in the first place? They had the choice and many \u2013 mostly famously Sarah Lucas \u2013 have turned down the chance over the years. The artists all say they are honoured to have been shortlisted, and their decision was contingent on the synergies between them \u2013 another combination, in another year, and it wouldn\u2019t have happened. But also, points out Cammock, this isn\u2019t an isolated incident. Look at the history of sport. \u201cThere have been many moments when people have taken a stand \u2013 moments where people have seen the interconnectedness between things and have made a decision. They run across the line together. They do the black power salute.\u201d Abu Hamdan pitches in: \u201cAnd there\u2019s Kaepernick\u201d \u2013 referring to the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who took the knee during The Star-Spangled Banner as a protest against racism. \u201cWe are not in an isolated bubble,\u201d says Cammock. \u201cWe are people too.\u201d We are in a moment when the traditional cultural authority of the arts prize \u2013 with its single \u201cgenius\u201d winner \u2013 is being challenged. More and more victors of prizes (Helen Marten, for example, who won the Turner in 2016) are choosing to share out the prize money with their fellow nominees. In the case of the Booker prize this year, it was the judges who refused to observe the rules, presenting Bernardine Evaristo and Margaret Atwood as joint winners in defiance of the organisers. Shani sees this as part of a wider shift \u2013 a mood of unpicking authority, of seeing through the accepted matrices of power and questioning them. It is possible that the world is moving beyond the monolithic, winner-takes-all prize \u2013 increasingly people are questioning the act that holds up one artist as the best. In the present case, it\u2019s hard not to fall for the sincerity of these four artists who, without cynicism, have expressed their beliefs and hopes through the means at their disposal. \u201cWhat did Audre Lorde say?\u201d says Cammock, in reference to the American poet and activist. \u201c\u2018Your silence will not protect you.\u2019 This is a moment of saying no to silence.\u201d \u2022 The Turner prize exhibition is at Turner Contemporary, Margate, until 12 January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
