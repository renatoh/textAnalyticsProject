Although Mitchell Johnson and Ryan Harris took all but two of the wickets between them, Ben Hilfenhaus conceded barely two runs per over from 31 overs, bowling dry as they call it. After an initial poor spell Jimmy Anderson improved and Chris Tremlett was excellent throughout. But Steve Finn conceded almost a run a ball. England's whole bowling strategy for this series has been based on incisive use of the new ball and disciplined attritional bowling thereafter. For Melbourne they will need to get back to that approach. \u2022 Interactive guide to all the Ashes venues \u2022 Sign up now for our weekly email The Spin \u2022 How to stay awake during the Tests \u2022 Follow our daily blog throughout the Ashes \u2022 The latest news and comment on our Ashes site Remember the comebacks However dominant Australia were at the Waca, England, as Ashes holders, still have the upper hand. The series is level with two to play. England's capacity to recover from defeat or near defeat has been considerable in the four years since the infamous whitewash. It is something Australia learned last year after Cardiff, when England went on to win the next match at Lord's; after the massive defeat at Headingley when they won at The Oval; and after a calamitous start in Brisbane this time, from which they recovered, and then went on to win by an innings at Adelaide. Andy Flower and Andrew Strauss are level-headed individuals and know that fortunes can be turned. England have not become a poor team in the space of a week. Change the batting order It is obvious that Ian Bell is now a considerable international batsman and the best technician in the side. As such, England will be asking themselves whether he makes his runs because he bats at six or whether, as a player of real stature, he is not being wasted. The form of Paul Collingwood, who, batting at five, averages around 15 in the dozen innings since he made a hundred in Chittagong, is linked to this for in effect Bell has been batting at five already. A case has even been made for him to move to four with Kevin Pietersen, also suspect early on against a moving ball, dropping one place. Whether or not Collingwood retains his place (and his catching is a huge factor as is the lack of cricket for the reserve batsman, Eoin Morgan), Bell must now be better utilised so that he does not run out of partners as he did in Perth. Neutralise Mr Cricket but absorb the lesson of his batting A little more than a month ago Mike Hussey was fighting for his international life, saved only by a second-innings hundred for his state just prior to selection for the first Test. Since then he has made more than 500 runs in the series, including two centuries and three half-centuries, which with his hundred at The Oval last year means he is the only batsman in Ashes history to make six successive scores in excess of 50. He has become the stabilising influence in an otherwise under-performing Australian top order. His batting at the Waca, a ground he knows intimately, was sublime, based on discretion outside off-stump and on the bounce, a punchy cover drive, a voracious pull and the push for a single. England need to bowl tight to him. He is playing England at the game that served them so well in the first two Tests. Do not go chasing the ball Did Mitchell Johnson really have a clue when he was going to swing the ball? The indications, from watching the scrambled seam as he delivered, are that it was more down to atmospherics and the condition of the ball. The test will come when he has to repeat it. But it is the uncertain element that will cause problems for England now. Hitherto the batsmen have been able to play him as a bowler who just slants the ball across the right-hander. Now they have been undone by in-swing, there will be a natural tendency to want to play at deliveries that until now have been left. So whether or not he swings another ball in the series, he will have created doubt. England, if they are to prosper, cannot go chasing the ball."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
