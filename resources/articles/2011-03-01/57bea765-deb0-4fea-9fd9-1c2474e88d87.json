But dry soil at this season offers another bonus. As I walked down the side of a drystone wall the other day I noticed a young woman levelling a veritable range of molehills with a fork. She explained that she had been waiting for the soil to dry out so she could deal with the pesky creatures (\"mudie-warps\" in this part of the country). She and her husband rent 250 hectares (617.5 acres) and have a Holstein herd of 300 animals, and for her birthday her husband had recently presented her with a set of half a dozen mole traps. She was now setting to work to deal with the offending animals \u2013 \"It's like painting the Forth Bridge with this acreage and this quantity of moles\". She intends to press on through the spring, until the grass is too long for this task. A willing assistant is her German Shepherd dog who was absent on this day but usually helps her locate a working mole underground with his acute sense of smell. I went on down the wall-side, leaving the farm-wife to wage war with the prospect of many more to clear in the coming weeks of rising temperatures and drying winds. Towards the bottom of the slope my path steepened where it fell towards a pretty dell and here I came across my first flowering celandines and daisies of the season. A tiny rill meandered beneath a stone slab and as I crossed this a lurking moorhen was startled into headlong escape downstream, soon hidden beneath a golden tangle of overhanging gorse. A short, stiff climb up the opposite slope brought me across more stone-walled pastures punctuated with molehills but these were beyond the border of the farm-wife's empire."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
