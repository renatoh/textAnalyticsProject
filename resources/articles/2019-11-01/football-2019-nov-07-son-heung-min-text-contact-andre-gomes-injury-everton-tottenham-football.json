The Tottenham forward, who put his psychological issues behind him to score twice in Wednesday\u2019s 4-0 Champions League win at Red Star Belgrade, contacted Gomes to express how sorry he felt for the player and his family. It was Son\u2019s trip during the 1-1 draw at Goodison Park on Sunday that led to Gomes getting his studs caught underneath him, crashing into the Spurs full-back Serge Aurier and suffering a fractured dislocation of his ankle. Son did not want to disclose what Gomes had said to him in response. \u201cI texted him before I flew [to Belgrade on Tuesday] and he texted me back,\u201d Son said. \u201cI still feel really, really bad about this. I feel really sorry. Football is a sport where something [like this] can happen; nobody wants to see this situation. I\u2019m so sad this happened and that I was involved with this situation. It\u2019s been a really, really tough few days. \u201cI just texted him to say: \u2018Best wishes to you, I\u2019m really sorry for you, your family and your teammates.\u2019 He texted me back probably when he got back home [after his surgery]. I don\u2019t want to talk about it [what Gomes said] too much.\u201d Son was still in a state of shock on Monday but was helped by his clubmates and messages of support from fans including those from Everton. He believes that he can show his respect to Gomes by working even harder than he has done previously. \u201cI\u2019m the guy who wants to play every time,\u201d Son said. \u201cI\u2019m the guy who wants to help the team \u2013 even if I was in shock. The team is every single other player. I had to think about this. I\u2019m not selfish, I don\u2019t want to be selfish. I\u2019m not the type to find an excuse. I want to be there all the time, involved in every single game. \u201cI have to respect that playing is what I have to do, what I love to do. I realise how lucky I am. Of course, Gomes got the injury but the people around me sent me really, really strong messages. My teammates and even Everton fans, as well as Tottenham fans, even from South Korea. I\u2019m really, really grateful for that. \u201cStill, I feel really sorry about this situation but on the pitch I want to work for it because the team needs especially positive energy. I tried to work out this situation. I want to pay them [people who sent messages] back on the pitch. I want to respect him [Gomes] as well and this is how I show respect \u2013 by working harder than in the past.\u201d Tottenham\u2019s goalkeeper Hugo Lloris has had surgery on his elbow injury and remains on course to return early next year, the club have said. They explained in a statement that the operation \u201cwas advised after further reviews by specialists found the elbow remained unstable\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
