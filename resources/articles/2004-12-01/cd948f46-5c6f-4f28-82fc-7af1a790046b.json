Further tests reveal his achilles injury to be worse than initially thought. The striker could now be sidelined for up to another 10 weeks rather than the four to six that Sir Alex Ferguson predicted at the weekend. As well as being a major setback to United's hopes of catching Chelsea and Arsenal at the top of the Premiership, Van Nistelrooy's absence could have serious ramifications for their chances of progressing to the Champions League quarter-finals. The Holland international has scored 36 goals in 37 European games for United and Ferguson will be dismayed by the thought of being without his most prolific attacker for either or both of the games against Milan on February 23 and March 8. Van Nistelrooy has not played since November 27. Ferguson, who said he was \"not surprised\" Roy Keane is thinking of extending his United career beyond next season, yesterday saw Jose Mourinho hit back at his claim that Chelsea will find it difficult to travel north and collect points. Mourinho responded by saying United will similarly struggle when they come south. Chelsea must visit United, Everton, Liverpool and Newcastle among other northern clubs, starting at Anfield on New Year's Day. Mourinho is convinced Ferguson's team will find the going tough at Arsenal, Crystal Palace, Charlton and Southampton. \"It could be correct that we lose a lot of points in the north,\" the Chelsea manager said. \"We don't know. For sure Manchester United will lose points in the south.\" One of Mourinho's few current problems is an injury to Scott Parker. He would like to buy cover for the midfielder but ruled out a big-name signing. \"Forget Joaquin, [Jermain] Defoe and everybody else you speak about,\" he said. \"If we do something, we won't do a big buy. To get better midfielders than we have, I don't know where to find them. We just need a player to give us help.\" Mourinho had a seasonal message for Chelsea fans. \"Family is more important than football, so don't care about whether we are first, second or third,\" he said. \"Be worried about the people you love, the world, peace and all these things.\" The universal issue most on the mind of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger yesterday seemed to be the overlooking of Thierry Henry for the world player of the year award this week. The Arsenal manager said he felt Henry should have taken the prize ahead of Ronaldinho and believes the Frenchman will be recognised as \"the player of the generation\" if he wins the 2005 award after being runner-up this year and last. \"His overall achievement will make him the player of the generation because he's in there every year,\" said Wenger. \"Once he wins it you will look back and say: 'He was second two years ago, second last year and first this year.'\" Wenger said he was \"very positive\" that Ashley Cole would extend his contract and did not rule out selling Edu next month or making a signing. \"If something exceptional comes up, you never say no but we are not in a situation where we need to buy,\" he said. The Frenchman was upbeat ahead of Arsenal's four games in 10 days, starting at home to Fulham. \"I'm convinced we have the belief back, the determination back and the team is focused more than ever to do well,\" he said. David Moyes, manager of third-placed Everton, acknowledged that his squad's ability to cope with a cluttered fixture list could be decisive. \"The Christmas period will be a real test of the small squad we have,\" he said, \"and it could have a real bearing on where we finish.\" George Boateng, the Middlesbrough midfielder, has broken a toe and is out of Boro's Christmas and New Year games and for possibly the whole of January. Boateng broke the toe in the first half against his former club Aston Villa last Saturday but stayed on the pitch for the entire 90 minutes. \"It is a huge disappointment,\" said Boateng's manager Steve McClaren. \"He has been our player of the season so far. It leaves us thin in midfield.\" The Brazilian Doriva is likely to replace Boateng initially, at Birmingham City on Sunday, and with Ray Parlour returning from injury Middlesbrough should have enough cover."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
