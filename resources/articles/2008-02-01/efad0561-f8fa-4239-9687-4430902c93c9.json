It tells the remarkable story of Jean-Dominique Bauby, the glamorous editor-in-chief of French Elle, left paralysed apart from one blinking, roving eye following a catastrophic illness. Disaster strikes in December 1995. Bauby, at the peak of his career, drives his nine-year-old son, Th\u00e9ophile, out for dinner and a night at the theatre in his sleek new convertible. The car glides through rolling hills; the camera shows the expression on the boy's face turning from delight to terror; the vehicle veers haphazardly to the side of the road and Th\u00e9ophile is seen leaping out, running to the nearest house for help. Bauby leans back on his luxury headrest, eyes wide with fear, mouth twisting grossly. He has had a cerebrovascular seizure, a type of stroke, which puts him in a coma for three weeks, and from which he emerges unable to talk, move or perform any of the basic functions of life. His children - he is given three in the film, though in reality he had just two - are shown struggling to behave normally. A tender Th\u00e9ophile wipes the drool from the corner of his mouth, then cries with his mother. His daughters sing to him, but there seems little connection. C\u00e9leste, his one real-life daughter, has seen the movie on three occasions and has cried every time. In the film, based on Bauby's lyrical, best-selling memoir of the same name (in French, Le scaphandre et le papillon), she is portrayed as a soulful nine-year-old who prays every night for her dad's recovery. Now 20, she has vivid memories of life before her father's illness - \"an amazing childhood\"; cycle rides in the country; long weekend lunches; \"perfect parents\". Then the illness. \"I remember the doctor trying to explain to me what happened and I remember saying to him, he has to wake up soon because I am not a patient person and he knows it ... \" And as Jean-Dominique wakes from the coma, C\u00e9leste remembers looking deep into his opened eye and not recognising him. \"This is not my father, you are lying,\" she shouts and runs out of the room. It is still a painful memory, this childish rejection. When we meet in a west London pub - she is currently living in the UK with her boyfriend, a Foxtons estate agent - C\u00e9leste covers her face as she recalls the moment, which passes as her altered father gradually becomes a more familiar playmate. \"I can remember playing with him in his wheelchair, pretending it was a formula one racing car,\" she says. \"I can remember being on the beach with him, and I remember singing and my brother asking me to shut up because I didn't know how to sing.\" Bauby does not recover, but he finds a way of surviving this \"locked-in syndrome\" (the diving bell in the book's title): he sees his children every other weekend, their mother visits every Tuesday, friends read at his bedside and he finds joy in the flights of imagination (the butterfly) that fill the pages of his book. Then, just days after publication of his memoir - dictated laboriously via 200,000 blinks of his left eye in response to a recited alphabet, his sole means of communication - Bauby suddenly dies, aged 44. The film is a beautiful portrait of Bauby's extraordinary achievement in writing his book. It also tells a far more ordinary, yet no less painful story, of a once happy family split apart by an affair - a heartbroken woman, a man in love, beset by guilt and the children they adore. Because shortly before the stroke, Bauby had left his children and their mother for another woman. For C\u00e9leste, the film's candid portrayal of her father's infidelity was a shock. In flashbacks Bauby is shown rolling in the sand with his girlfriend; we see her splayed breast-bare on a bed. Even after the illness, Bauby's wandering left eye comes to rest on naked, sun-kissed legs, gaping blouses and a pair of full lips pursed in a blown kiss. Until the film, C\u00e9leste continued to see her father through the eyes of a nine-year-old girl. \"I knew he was not with my mum any more, but the first time it was hard to watch. I didn't know this side of him.\" Even after the separation, Bauby saw his children regularly and remained on friendly terms with their mother. C\u00e9leste remembers him as a bon vivant; a loving father, who, when she couldn't sleep at her friend's house, would pick her up in the dead of night, put her in his bed and wait for her drift into sleep. \"I want to remember this side of my dad, when I was a kid,\" she says. The film, however, does not make it easy. In one exquisitely painful scene, Ines, Bauby's beautiful, young lover, who has not yet had the courage to visit him, finally calls. \"Do you want me to come?\" she begs to know over the speakerphone. C\u00e9line, the mother of his children, is forced to translate his blinked message back to her rival. \"Each day I wait for you.\" \"I did not know that my mother suffered so much,\" says C\u00e9leste. It is not something they have discussed, though they have watched the film together. \"I don't want to ask her to think about this again. We are three, my mother, my brother and I, and we are happy.\" As a family they are stoical in their suffering. They tried therapy a couple of times, but it did not help. \"We can deal with this ourselves and we are doing well.\" Though C\u00e9leste is currently on an internship in London after studying at the European Business School, she still has a studio apartment in Paris on the same floor as that of her brother and her mother. \"My mother is the strongest woman - she won't cry. I can cry, she can't.\" As for the other woman in her father's life, C\u00e9leste remembers seeing her mother and Ines embrace at the funeral - an extraordinarily glamorous fashion occasion with supermodels and paparazzi (\"I thought all funerals were like that\") - but otherwise the subject is closed. The film itself has been a sort of therapy. \"In a way it's the end, I hope. I'm relieved. Finally I hope we can close the book. I think it's a great movie, but imagine, for 10 years you've been trying to recover from your father's death, and there's this film hanging over you.\" For Th\u00e9ophile, who is studying film in Paris, losing his father has been perhaps even more challenging than for his sister. \"He remembers everything, every single moment. At least I wasn't there when it happened. He saw the beginning of the end and he was by himself. \"This movie helped me to understand him. I would like to say to him a thousand times sorry. I did not know how much he suffered. We had some communication problems, but now I understand everything.\" So, C\u00e9leste is left with a new understanding of her mother and her brother, but her famous, flamboyant father remains - despite a book, a film and a collection of intimate memories - essentially a mystery to her. \"I know he was tall. He liked to eat and he was a successful man. But I don't really know my father and that's sad.\" \u00b7The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (12A) is out in cinemas this weekend"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
