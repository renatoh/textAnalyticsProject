Image of the week Nothing to see: China\u2019s glass bridges have been quietly closed off in the northern province of Hebei amid safety fears. Among the 32 see-through bridges, walkways and mountain viewing platforms that have been cordoned off is Hongyagu bridge, at 488 vertigo-inducing metres, the world\u2019s longest such glass structure.

In this picture he has a crack at recreating ancient Egypt, as far as the knowledge of his time will allow. The city outside which baby Moses is found looks at first sight like a standard vision of classical antiquity, with Greek temples and a Roman amphitheatre. But it also has Egyptian obelisks, known to Poussin because several had been brought to imperial Rome and re-erected by Renaissance and baroque Popes. Most impressively, he includes a distant view of the pyramids at Giza. This, too, is based on his adopted city where he could study the pyramid of Cestius, built by a wealthy ancient Roman in emulation of Egyptian monuments. Both Cestius and Poussin bear witness to Europe\u2019s enduring Egyptomania. \u2022 National Gallery, London. Don\u2019t forget To follow us on Twitter: @GdnArtandDesign.
