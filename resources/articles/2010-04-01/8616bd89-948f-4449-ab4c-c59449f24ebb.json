England are due to leave Heathrow on Sunday and, with Nats talking of a \"continuously improving situation\", there is a possibility that restrictions will be lifted over the UK by tomorrow evening. The England and Wales Cricket Board was due to meet on Wednesday to discuss whether it needed to draw up emergency travel plans. At one stage these were likely to involve the option of a ferry or train journey to southern Europe but that prospect has receded as the ash cloud moves south and Spanish airports have become the latest to close. An ECB spokesman said: \"It's a constantly changing situation so decisions cannot be taken too early. Things are beginning to look more positive but we will continue to monitor events. We are determined to be in the Caribbean to contest World Twenty20.\" Even if England's Sunday flight was to be put back, they would still have a few days' grace. They are due to play a warm-up match against Bangladesh on 28 April before their first match against West Indies five days later. They will be most concerned about the travel plans of their IPL players, all of whom, knocked out or not, have been unable to return to England. If Bangalore reach the IPL final on Sunday, Kevin Pietersen and Eoin Morgan will, in any event, have to travel separately from the rest of the squad."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
