More specifically, one of my three wives, and my love for the woman I was married to while I lived there. Actually, I am not in the least materialistic; but as I have to choose an inanimate object to save, I choose my drawing book. Every room in my house contains pens and paper, so they are always to hand. Ordinarily, though, I don't tend to get attached to objects, because I feel that every moment of my life has had its own style. In that way I'd prefer to live in an ever-changing environment, rather than in a specific way. Besides, there are too many cliches about 'design' - for instance, the difference between French and English style. Obviously we are two countries with distinct cultures and styles and yet, in both, you'll find people with classic taste living in homes full of traditional pieces, while those with more modern taste will surround themselves with more contemporary items. The concept of 'designer style' is, I think, a real cliche - it doesn't really exist. Ultimately, what is in my head is more important than any object, and a good designer can create using any material - he or she doesn't necessarily have to have a pen and paper to do it. But I've still chosen my drawing book because it's all about possibility. It's not what's already written on my pad which is important, but what I'll write or draw in the future. I'm spurred on by the fact that the perfect design has not been created yet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
