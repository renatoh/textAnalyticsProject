As newspaper circulation directors wring their hands over the steady flight of readers to the web, their magazine counterparts were last week celebrating one of the best sets of figures in years, with sales of consumer magazines rising due to a series of new launches that helped reinvigorate the market. In the second half of last year sales of consumer magazines were 3.1% higher than in the same period in 2004. New launches such as the National Magazine Company's Reveal and IPC's Pick Me Up contributed to an impressive 7.4% growth figure in the resurgent women's weekly market alone, according to the latest figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulations. \"At a time when people have so much choice and access to free news and entertainment through digital TV, digital radio and online, it's incredible that they are choosing to consume magazines with growing enthusiasm and in growing numbers,\" says Nik Vyas, group press director at ZenithOptimedia. \"For a mature medium to show this level of growth is significant and the volume of activity in the form of launches and relaunches is testament to the vibrancy and vitality of the magazine industry,\" he adds. Inflationary effect The women's weekly market was the main driver. After a solid but unspectacular debut ABC last year, Reveal's circulation rose by an impressive 44% year on year to 345,502 copies, making it the fastest growing magazine in the sector. And Pick Me Up, launched in January 2005, averaged nearly half a million sales, making it the most successful weekly women's magazine launch for more than a decade. According to IPC, 300,000 of Pick Me Up's readers are new to the real-life sector. At 32, the Pick Me Up reader's average age is a decade younger than the average reader of real-life magazines. It is the continuation of a trend first started three years ago when Emap launched Closer, the celebrity/real-life hybrid that has overtaken Now to become Britain's biggest selling celebrity weekly if you remove Jordan's inflationary effect on OK!'s circulation. The Richard Desmond-owned weekly sold more copies over the six-month period, but the huge sales boost it enjoyed from the wedding of Jordan and Peter Andre was entirely responsible for pushing the average up 20%. Inevitably, the more traditional women's weeklies have been hit by the success of the new entrants, although the effect was not as disastrous as it might have been. Market leader Take a Break, published by Bauer, fell 3.7% year on year but it still sells almost twice as many copies as its closest competitor. Sales of Chat fell 1% to be overtaken by OK!, but that effect is unlikely to last - barring another Jordan wedding. Losing relevance Monthly women's magazines were hit harder as the popularity of Emap's new weekly fashion magazine Grazia began to eat into sales. Glamour, Cosmopolitan, Marie Claire and Company all lost sales between June and December as Grazia increased its circulation by 10% to average 170,783 copies a week. Company and New Woman were the worst affected, with respective sales falls of 15% and 18% year on year, while sales of Glamour, Britain's biggest selling fashion monthly, were down by more than 5% year on year at 585,984. \"There is a feeling that monthly magazines are losing the relevance they once had. Everyone lives their lives that much faster now - and people aren't used to having to wait,\" says Mark Gallagher, press director at media buying agency Manning Gottlieb OMD. It was the same story in the men's market, where weekly lads' magazines Nuts and Zoo continue to take sales from the monthlies. Emap's FHM, Britain's biggest-selling men's monthly, suffered a painful 13.6% fall year on year, inflicted partly by its sister title Zoo, while Dennis Publishing's Maxim fell below the 200,000 mark. The success of the two men's weeklies makes a third almost inevitable. There has been speculation that Emap could launch a second magazine that is downmarket of Zoo (no, really), to counteract the lost sales of FHM. And with Nuts and Zoo eating into sales of the red-top newspapers, News International's ambitious new magazines arm must be a prime candidate to launch a weekly men's magazine.
