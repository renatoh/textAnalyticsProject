Kelly will announce a new planning white paper to fast-track the building of key infrastructure projects such as nuclear power stations, gas storage facilities, wind farms and airport runways. And she will outline policies for local authorities and businesses to reduce CO2 and adapt to intense weather patterns. A new national framework to determine the country's infrastructure needs over 10 to 25 years will be the centrepiece of Kelly's white paper. The framework's conclusions will be informed by public consultation and parliamentary scrutiny, the Communities Minister will say. Once the framework is finalised, a new independent planning commission (IPC) will decide whether major infrastructure decisions go ahead, dealing with up to 25 projects of national importance each year. The commission will be staffed by planners, lawyers, environmentalists and 'community engagement' specialists. ' Yesterday, Kelly told The Observer: 'We have to go further and faster in reforming the planning system,' adding, 'I don't think the current system works well for anyone at the moment. The only ones to benefit are those who benefit from very expensive legal fees. We have to streamline it to make it faster, but also give local people a greater say in how the plans are drawn up.' The move will delight the business community, which has long complained that the planning system is a drag on growth. But it will infuriate many local authorities and campaigners who fear the beating heart of the planning system - its democratic accountability - will be compromised. Undeterred, the government is determined not to let projects of national importance be bogged down by what it regards as a slow planning system that allows individual local authorities to delay giving consent. And it wants to reduce the UK's reliance on Russian gas by building nuclear and renewable power facilities. There was dismay when the London Array, an offshore windfarm in the Thames Estuary designed to supply a quarter of London homes with green electricity, was denied the go-ahead after a Conservative local authority in Kent refused to allow the sub-station needed to service it to be built on its patch. 'How can the government lecture other countries about addressing climate change when we can't make major decisions to address it in our own backyard,' said a Whitehall insider. There is also concern that the UK spends less on infrastructure than comparable European economies. The government and the CBI often argue that it took seven years and 37 applications before Heathrow Terminal Five was given permission. 'This is not about business getting its own way,' says John Cridland, deputy director-general of the CBI. 'For me it's about how the climate change debate has brought our planning system into context. In a much-changed world, the planning system has failed to keep pace with the challenges of the 21st century. Climate change is now the most pressing challenge of our time. Combine this with the need to ensure the lights don't go out as risks to our energy supplies grow in an unstable world, and as many of our power stations reach the end of their useful lives, and we have a problem.' The CBI says that as well as the London Array two gas storage projects, facilities for importing liquefied natural gas, have been refused planning consent in the last 12 months. But planning experts and campaigners, while welcoming the idea of a national spatial strategy, are uncomfortable about taking major decisions out of local control. The debate is expected to polarise opinion. Local Government Association chairman Lord Bruce-Lockhart says: 'The government must show how its proposals for an independent commission will avoid undermining both the environmental goals to which it is committed and the voices of local councils and the communities they represent.' Kelly will tomorrow also controversially place a key mechanism used to limit the number of out-of-town shopping developments under review. Though stressing her commitment to a 'town centre first policy', Kelly has been swayed by arguments from Asda in particular. It says the 'needs test' should be scrapped as it has unintended consequences that prevent there being effective competition to Tesco. The needs test is a precise mathematical assessment that determines whether retail development out of town can progress, using a ratio of total shop floorspace to an area's population. Critics point to the way supermarket numbers have exploded in the past 10 years and that aggressive land acquisition has allowed Tesco to steal a march. The debate is set to erupt tomorrow. Green horizons Fighting climate change will be enshrined in planning law later this year. Local authorities will be compelled to ensure car use is reduced while encouraging public transport and cycling. Planners are beginning to realise they are going to have to cater for a world of more intense climatic conditions. On Wednesday, the Town and Country Planning Association (TCPA) will publish 'Climate Change Adaptation by Design Guide' for sustainable communities. It could well turn out to be a blueprint for our future cities. Its author, Rob Shaw, policy director at the TCPA, said: 'We must adapt to the inevitability of the 40C city. Responding to this requires innovative use of space within and around buildings. Large canopy trees combined with green space and green roofs will help to keep summer temperatures in cities cooler and minimise the risk of urban flooding.' Shaw argues that, unless concerted measures are taken, the implications of this will 'threaten to undermine the long-term desirability of towns and cities as places to live and work'."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
