The written statement, by a former jobcentre official, John Longden, says frontline staff were ordered to \u201cagitate and inconvenience\u201d customers so they fell foul of the rules, enabling staff to stop their benefits payments. Staff who failed to meet sanctions targets each month were threatened with disciplinary action, he claims. Longden says he was told by a manager that the message with regard to customers was: \u201cLet\u2019s set them up from day one.\u201d He adds: \u201cCustomers were being deliberately treated inappropriately in order to achieve [staff] performance [targets] without regard for natural justice and their welfare.\u201d Longden\u2019s evidence covers events he says he witnessed at Salford and Rochdale jobcentres between 2011 and 2013. It has been lodged with the Commons work and pensions select committee, which is investigating benefit sanctions policy. A sanction involves the stopping of claimants\u2019 benefit payments for at least four weeks \u2013 equivalent to almost \u00a3300 \u2013 as a penalty for breach of benefit rules and conditions, typically failure to look for work or attend jobcentre appointments. Ministers introduced tighter rules for claiming benefits in October 2012, saying sanctions were a \u201clast resort\u201d that would encourage claimants to \u201cengage\u201d with jobcentres. However, critics say jobcentres are increasingly neglecting to help claimants find jobs and are instead focusing on finding ways to impose financial penalties on them. In further written evidence to the committee, another former Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) official accuses jobcentres of \u201cbullying people off the [unemployment] register\u201d. Ian Wright, a former personal adviser at a Leicester jobcentre, says he was ordered by managers to send more claimants for sanction, and was threatened with disciplinary action when he questioned the policy. Unscrupulous staff would target weak and vulnerable claimants for sanctions, he states. In one case a customer who could neither read nor write was formally directed to put their CV on a job match website. \u201cUnsurprisingly they did not manage this task and were sanctioned.\u201d The PCS union, which represents jobcentre staff, said the evidence chimed with its own straw poll of members, which found almost two-thirds had experienced pressure to refer claimants for a sanction inappropriately, while more than a third had been placed on a formal performance improvement plan for not making enough referrals. PCS is one of a number of witnesses giving evidence to the committee on Wednesday morning. Longden claims that staff used several tricks to set up claimants. On several occasions jobcentre advisers purposefully booked job appointments without informing the claimant, ensuring they could be sanctioned when they failed to attend. Claimants would be set unreasonable job search targets, referred for jobs for which they were clearly unsuited, or ordered to sign on every day in the hope they would fail in a task, miss an appointment or be late. \u201cThe aim was to find an opportunity to make a referral to the decision maker [an official who decides whether to sanction a claimant] with the possibility of getting the customer sanctioned. \u201cIt was distressing to see so many customers treated in such a way,\u201d states Longden. \u201cOne customer was made to attend daily for two months and eventually broke down and wept in the office.\u201d He adds: \u201cStaff were threatened by the cluster manager that their jobs would be taken by other people if they didn\u2019t do what they were told.\u201d Longden says he raised objections with his line manager more than once after witnessing staff take inappropriate action, but no action was taken. He says staff \u201cwere being asked to behave in a manner that was against the [DWP\u2019s] values of integrity and honesty\u201d. The confrontational approach caused arguments with customers and sometimes police would have to be called to restore order. Longden, who says he spent 23 years as a jobcentre adviser, states: \u201cSanctions of customers were encouraged by managers daily, with staff being told to look at every engagement with the customer as an opportunity to take sanction action. \u201cI was personally told by a manager to \u2018agitate\u2019 and \u2018inconvenience\u2019 customers in order to get them to leave the register.\u201d A DWP spokesman said: \u201cMr Longden\u2019s allegations were thoroughly investigated and no evidence was found to substantiate them. Furthermore, the people named in the allegations strongly refute them. \u201cThe reality is, sanctions are a necessary part of the benefits system but they are used as a last resort in a tiny minority of cases where people don\u2019t play by the rules. Jobcentre Plus advisers work hard every day to help people into work. There are no targets for sanctions.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
