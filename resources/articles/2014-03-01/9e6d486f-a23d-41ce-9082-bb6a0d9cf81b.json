They couldn't understand how competitive I was just for PE and netball.\" Bleasdale is 22 now, but if anything that competitive mentality has only hardened. She is direct and she intends to win. This weekend is no different, even though she competes at the World Indoor Championships in Sopot, Poland, against a stacked field that includes the American Jenni Suhr, the gold medallist at London 2012, and the Cuban Yarisley Silva, who took Olympic silver. Bleasdale also has previous with Anna Rogowska, Poland's best chance of a medal, and admits she could be seen as the villain after beating the home-town girl in a jump-off after they finished joint first at the 2013 European Indoor Championships in Gothenburg. Rogowska's coach tried to talk Bleasdale into sharing gold as both athletes were drained, but she declined and went on to win. \"She wanted to share the gold but I refused,\" Bleasdale says. \"I wanted to fight for it and beat her. That's the fire in me.\" A year on, and before facing Rogowska in front of her home crowd, Bleasdale is in no mood to build bridges. \"I'm surprised that she didn't want to fight for the gold,\" she says. \"It showed to me that she was weak in that situation. That inspires me more to take her down even more. \"I'd rather have got silver than shared gold,\" she adds. \"I'm such a fighter and competitor that I don't want to share gold with someone. I want to fight for the gold for my own and I was ready to risk losing that. I knew that she was done and tired, psychologically a bit weak. It paid off. \"It sounds really harsh when I say it but that's what athletics is. I think she was a little bit upset. She was here to defend her title and had the opportunity to do that. I could tell she wasn't happy. But I wanted to win gold for GB and not win it joint with Poland.\" The World Indoor Championships will be a step up, but Bleasdale believes she can handle it. As a 20-year-old, she cleared 4.87m, putting her on third on the all-time list behind Yelena Isinbayeva and Suhr. And training with her new coach, Scott Simpson, is going so well that she feels a personal best is within reach. \"I'm really pleased with my run of competitions,\" Bleasdale says. \"I've done three 4.70s back to back. I feel like I'm in 80, 85, 90 shape. The training's going awesome and I feel fitter and stronger than ever. I feel like I'm in PB shape. I need to deliver that. \"That said, I had a howler in my last competition,\" she chuckles. \"It was in a shopping mall. People were coming out of H&amp;M and stood there watching. It was an amazing atmosphere and I'd never experienced that before. I had three attempts at 4.63m and it didn't come together. It definitely isn't a reflection and hasn't knocked my confidence. I'm motivated ahead of Sopot.\" Two years ago, Bleasdale won bronze at the World Indoor Championships in Istanbul but she has flown under the radar since. She was sixth at London 2012 and, despite taking gold in Gothenburg, the rest of last year was a big disappointment as achilles and back injuries wrecked her season and forced her to miss the world championships in Moscow. \"I loved Istanbul. I took a bronze \u2013 my first senior medal,\" she says. \"And I came back a year later and won the gold in a jump-off. I loved that, the pressure. They're really fond memories. I'm excited to get to another indoor championships as missing out on the world outdoors was heartbreaking.\" With Mo Farah focusing on the London marathon, Jessica Ennis-Hill pregnant, James Dasaolu injured and Katarina Johnson-Thompson competing in the long jump rather than the heptathlon, Bleasdale is one of the British team's best medal chances. She admits to feeling the pressure, but she doesn't flinch under its weight. She believes she can step up. \"It's upsetting as we could have had a really strong team but I still think there are a lot of medallists like me, Laura Muir and Eilidh Child,\" she says. \"I feel like a little bit of pressure on me to deliver a medal but I feel capable of handling that. I have no excuses.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
