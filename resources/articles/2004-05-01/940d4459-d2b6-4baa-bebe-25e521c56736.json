I'd attended a pretty lowly comprehensive in east London and started my academic career with an HND in electronics. But I soon acquired a taste for it - I did a degree in applied physics and followed that up with an MSc in manufacturing systems - and moved pretty easily into a job as a production engineer. Although manufacturing processes can vary widely, the fundamental principles that underlie them are largely the same. Over the next eight years, I worked for firms manufacturing products as diverse as corrugated cardboard, electronic banknote counters and dispensers - even one making babies' nappies. After several years, I became restless and was asking myself all sorts of questions about how I wanted my life to be. I was looking for a new challenge, to do something that would stretch me and possibly take me in a new direction, and a PhD fitted most of the criteria. I went from earning a reasonable salary, to the lowly amount PhD students are paid in this country, but it was a fascinating two and a half years. Cranfield is an interesting place to study, partly because it is entirely made up of postgrad students and so it has a rather more industrious atmosphere. Although it typically takes three years to complete a PhD, I managed to shorten that by six months. I examined some of the softer man agement skills in and around manufacturing -looking at issues such as strategic outsourcing and the like. With six months to go, I started applying for jobs and while I'd like to say the PhD helped me get my current job, it probably didn't. I now work as a consultant for the Leicestershire-based Pera Innovation. I'm mostly working on a Department of Trade and Industry initiative advising manufacturers in the East Midlands on how to be more successful. I am focusing on helping companies set up partnerships with firms in the ten new countries in the EU. Looking back, it wasn't that hard to give up the salary for university life although I think it helped that my wife is an academic. It certainly worked for me. \u00b7miles.brignall@tiscali.fr"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
