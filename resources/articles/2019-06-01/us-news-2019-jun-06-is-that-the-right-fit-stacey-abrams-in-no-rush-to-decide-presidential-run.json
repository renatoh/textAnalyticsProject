With some two dozen Democrats officially in the race for 2020, Stacey Abrams is the only one by the starting line unsure if she\u2019ll compete. Indecision is a label most politicians will go to great lengths to avoid. George W Bush declared himself \u201cthe decider\u201d, while the former White House spokesman Sean Spicer memorably characterized his old boss as \u201cunbelievably decisive\u201d. But Abrams is leaning into her indecision, seeing it as an opportunity to more fully and intelligently explore her possible paths forward after her dramatic run for the governorship of Georgia last year ended in defeat \u2013 but catapulted her on to the national stage. \u201cWe often push ourselves to make quick choices simply for the expediency of either ourselves or whoever is asking the question,\u201d she said in a private side room of the Renaissance Hotel in downtown Washington DC, where she\u2019s just off-stage from a speech at a liberal thinktank conference. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t fully investigated, you can decide in haste and repent at leisure,\u201d she said. Whatever Abrams does next, other 2020 runners will be watching closely. \u201cI believe she would change the game,\u201d said Aimee Allison, founder of She The People, a group that works to elect women of color. \u201cShe would change the calculus for the country\u2019s strongest Democratic voting bloc: black women and other women of color.\u201d That\u2019s not an uncommon opinion. \u201cI would be absolutely terrified if I were any of the candidates running that she might jump in the race,\u201d said Democratic operative Jess McIntosh who\u2019s been excited about Abrams since 2012, long before she was a household name. Abrams\u2019 Georgia campaign didn\u2019t land her the job she wanted \u2013 indeed, she chalks up her loss to the voter suppression issues she went to war with in her campaign. But that race, along with everything she\u2019s done since as founder of two new voting-rights not-for-profits and a rising voice in Democratic politics, has now made her \u201cthe most popular progressive not in the race\u201d, as the Washington Post put it recently. In Washington, Abrams has just finished her remarks in the hotel\u2019s grand ballroom as the keynote speaker at the \u201cideas conference\u201d put on by the pre-eminent liberal thinktank Center for American Progress. And already she\u2019s been artfully demurring on 2020. \u201cThere\u2019s a solution\u201d to the current crisis in American leadership, Abrams told the audience at one point. \u201cIt is not, however, having everyone in America run for president \u2013 but that is also not an announcement.\u201d With practically every other star in the party currently running for president, Abrams has become the Democrats\u2019 de facto headliner for such speeches, delivering a State of the Union rebuttal, meeting with party leadership and top-tier presidential candidates, and pulling off major donor events for the Democratic National Committee. She\u2019s just back from a west coast tour promoting her new book Lead From The Outside \u2013 a kind of memoir-cum-empowerment guide for the less advantaged. (When it was published last year the New York Times book review compared Abrams\u2019 writing to a young Barack Obama\u2019s.) \u201cI\u2019m not sleeping a lot,\u201d Abrams admitted. For months, political media have been reporting that she\u2019s \u201cset to reveal soon whether she\u2019ll run for president\u201d, with various outlets drawing out pros and cons of her possible timelines. But Abrams herself doesn\u2019t seem overly concerned with reaching a verdict. Until recently, she says her every waking thought revolved around the Georgia governor\u2019s race; and reconsidering her options in the wake of a loss, for her, means careful deliberation. \u201cI\u2019m shifting gears in a way that is consequential for more than just me \u2013 it\u2019s consequential for anyone I ask to support me, for anyone who gives up another job to come and work with me,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s everyone\u2019s responsibility to make decisions that aren\u2019t driven by satisfying one person\u2019s notion of what you should be, but by fully understanding who you will be when you decide to move forward.\u201d What comes next is a question she\u2019s has been weighing for months, having recently realized she does not want to run for Senate, a conclusion reached through what for Abrams is a characteristically systematic process of deliberation: asking herself what she wants, why she wants it, and how to get there. Harry Reid, the former Democratic leader of the Senate has expressed disappointment that so many of his party\u2019s political powerhouses opted out of Senate bids this cycle. But Abrams rejects the idea that choosing what\u2019s best for her is somehow unpatriotic, adding it\u2019s \u201chubris\u201d to think that only she could win. \u201cMy decision had nothing to do with whether I could win or not \u2013 I think I could win,\u201d she said of not running for Senate. \u201cIt really had to do with, is that the right fit for me? As I think about whether I\u2019m going to run for president, it\u2019s a similar conversation.\u201d Though she hasn\u2019t answered the in-or-out ultimatum so many have put to her, she\u2019s still offering valuable insight into what kind of political leader she\u2019d be. It\u2019s one who arrives at big decisions only after careful consideration, and who seeks political office only when she\u2019s clear about why she wants it. As Abrams put it recently, \u201cWhen I ran for governor of Georgia, it was not for a title, it was for a job.\u201d In that sense all the hyperventilation about whether she\u2019ll be throwing her hat into the presidential race or waiting for another shot at the Georgia governorship in 2022, misses a larger point. Her vision for Democrats is powerful in its simplicity: that America will realize its progressive ideals when its electorate looks like its citizenry. In speeches traversing the country, Abrams has detailed the litany of ways voters in her state have been kept from the ballot box and flagging what she sees as other examples of voter suppression efforts under way in Texas, Arizona, and elsewhere. She\u2019s also shared hard-won solutions and strategies, detailing the \u201cthree-pronged attack\u201d she deployed in her work with the New Georgia Project, the non-partisan group she founded back in 2013 to help reach and register more than 800,000 voters in poor parts of the state. But, of course, those efforts still left her short of the votes needed to win in Georgia, and it\u2019s yet to be proven that her strategy is scalable nationally. The theory does appear to be what she\u2019s testing, however, and its appeal is powerful. Voting rights seem like something everyone should support \u2013 nobody in either party wants to be seen as being pro-disenfranchisement after all \u2013 but getting more Americans registered has a clear Democratic skew. Perhaps that helps explain why Republicans have been skeptical of voter registration projects in the past. Or even why a Republican-led statewide ethics commission has been launched into her gubernatorial campaign and allied groups that worked to expand voting access. Abrams\u2019 team has called the investigation a partisan witch-hunt, following an election in which her opponent held on to his job as secretary of state \u2013 a perch from which he was able to purge more than 1.5 million registered voters from the rolls, including 850,000 people kicked off for not voting in two consecutive election cycles, and an additional 53,000 whose registration applications imperfectly matched their driver\u2019s licenses. Abrams lost by just 54,723 votes. Now, though she may not be running for president, Abrams is keeping a presidential-campaign level schedule, lecturing at Brookings on one day, and zipping cross-country on a book tour the next. Wherever she goes the political reality is this: whether or not she runs, Stacey Abrams is already influencing the presidential race. From the airwaves, at fundraisers, and in one-on-one conversations with presidential candidates, she\u2019s making her priorities \u2013 the why of whatever form her political candidacy ultimately takes \u2013 known, and known widely. Her speech in Washington was addressed as much to the presidential field as to the policy wonks sitting there in the room. \u201cWhether we have 23, 24, 25, or 150 candidates for president we should demand from every single person \u2026 they must speak about voter suppression every day until every person who is legally entitled to vote has the right to vote in the United States of America,\u201d she told them. \u201cThey must also be willing to look every voter in the eye and say, \u2018I see you. I understand your challenges. I see the barriers you face and I\u2019m willing to tackle those obstacles, not through vague language and not through programs but through action, through policy, and through determination, because when we see our voters and we give them their voices, we will see the change we need in America and will survive for another generation,\u201d she said. A week earlier Abrams had put out a video rallying against new anti-abortion laws alongside Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar, a show of political force implicitly (if not subtly) putting Abrams on the same level as top female presidential candidates. Of course, that may be more a display of political might than any indication of actual intent. She is certainly determined to carve her own path. Media reports suggesting her name was on the lips of certain presidential candidates as a desirable running mate, including rumors she\u2019d been singled out as the prohibitive favorite of the current presidential frontrunner, Joe Biden, were not well received by Abrams. Abrams is well aware that she\u2019s on a shortlist of Democrats who can generate excitement nationally and knows better than to let the Washington whisper mill sell her abilities short by casting her as another guy\u2019s number two. And so, having received no phone call to which she might respond, Abrams took this particular piece of her mind to national airwaves, explaining to the unacquainted why \u201cyou don\u2019t run for second place.\u201d She is still angry about the story. \u201cI think it is deeply problematic that there would be a discussion of relegating any woman to the role of second when the primary has yet to fully take shape,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a reflection again of this notion of what leadership looks like.\u201d Abrams was schooled early in the soft bigotry of seemingly ordinary assumptions. As a middle school student she won a local writing contest only to learn the white woman distributing the $50 prize, upon seeing Abrams, did not believe she could be the winner \u2013 one of many regrettable stops along the way to a remarkable adulthood which taught Abrams to distrust people\u2019s artificially low expectations for her. Also, the rigid societal strictures around what women and particularly minority women can or cannot do. As a young person, she thought winning a Rhodes scholarship seemed an impossibly high achievement and she threw herself upon the challenge. She\u2019s recalled the rejection she received as deeply painful, but it also taught her something perhaps more precious than a win: that defeat isn\u2019t fatal. Before she served as leadership in the Georgia statehouse, she lived more lives than anyone but a cat, making her way as bureaucrat, businesswoman, tax attorney and \u2013 when she found herself wanting to read more fantasy about people who looked like her \u2013 as an author of romantic suspense fiction, under the nom de plume Selena Montgomery. Her life story is a powerful statement of expanding the possible and Abrams\u2019 wants to help others do the same. But in the 2020 contest, sexism is already out in force, disguised as a seemingly straightforward question: can a woman running for president really win? Abrams has heard it all too often, recalling how during her last campaign well-meaning people would praise her capability and smarts before whispering what they perceived to be a fatal political diagnosis, \u201cbut you\u2019re a black woman\u201d. In fact what\u2019s fatal are such misperceptions and Abrams thinks her attunements to such pernicious dynamics would help set her apart from the field. After Pete Buttigieg warned dismissively about the lure of \u201cidentity politics\u201d, Abrams was center stage explaining how the term had become a \u201cdog whistle\u201d for conservatives and a disappointing number of liberals who mischaracterize the real need for awareness of challenges faced across backgrounds as either a willful politics of division or, even more crudely, as the practice of simply voting for whomever looks most like you. Voters need elected officials who can not only reflect their needs but also understand their obstacles, Abrams tells me offstage. \u201cWe should not see that identification as a detraction. If you cannot see the obstacles or if you refuse to countenance them as real then how are you going to help those communities advance?\u201d As for the notion \u201cidentity politics\u201d is voting for whoever looks like you? For white men, it\u2019s called American history. \u201cMany have only ever had the choice to vote for people who don\u2019t share their identities,\u201d she tells me of minority voters. \u201cThe opportunity to expand their choices is a good thing, it is a reflection of a growing and maturing democracy where we can have the marginalized stand up and see themselves reflected not only in their voting patterns, but in their choices for election.\u201d And she adds, \u201cThe demographic inflection point that we are in as a nation is accelerating.\u201d It\u2019s a fancy way of saying that America is running out of time to get stuff right, but only she knows what role she\u2019ll seek to play in this historical moment. And, for the moment, she\u2019s not telling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
