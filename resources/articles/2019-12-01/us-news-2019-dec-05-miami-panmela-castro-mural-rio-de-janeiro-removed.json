The work, by the Brazilian artist Panmela Castro, showed a black woman being held in a headlock, with the caption: \u201cWoman who filmed abused [sic] by police officers is beaten and arrested.\u201d It was painted on in the parking lot of the Aria 21 venue on Monday as part of a week-long exhibition for Miami Art Week \u2013 but was painted over the following day after managers at the space told Castro police had complained. \u201cI did not imagine this would happen at one of the biggest art fairs in the US. I cried with revulsion,\u201d said Castro, whose works have been exhibited internationally. The mural was based on the experience of a student of Castro\u2019s, who was handcuffed and arrested after filming police officers questioning a man in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Rocinha favela, days after police killed eight people in the neighbourhood. \u201cIt talks about police abuse, so when the Miami police say it has to be removed it is also police abuse,\u201d Castro said. Killings by the notoriously violent police in Rio de Janeiro state have climbed under Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, and the state governor, Wilson Witzel, who both campaigned on an iron-fist approach to violent crime. Managers at Aria 21 said they did not want to jeopardise their good relationship with police. \u201cThe commander saw the painting, and he calls us aside and he says: \u2018If you guys really want to do good \u2026 you have to get this out,\u2019\u201d said Jerusa Noveletto, one of Aria 21\u2019s managers. \u201cWe tried to explain that she\u2019s from another country, she\u2019s just trying to show what\u2019s going on there \u2013 but they didn\u2019t want to have that.\u201d She was not sure which police station the message had come from. Alessandra Gold, who runs Aria 21, said Castro was offered the chance to change her work but declined. \u201c[The police] were unsure why we had the message on the wall when we had such an amazing relationship,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have 800 to a thousand people coming through, you have kids and families \u2013 and families of police officers, too \u2013 it is very family-orientated space. Her work was very aggressive.\u201d In an email, Wynwood\u2019s police commander, Daniel Kerr, said there was absolutely no police involvement in the decision to remove the mural, which he said he was not aware of. One Brazilian art specialist said the censorship \u2013 which came days after nine people were trampled to death when police raided a street party in a S\u00e3o Paulo favela \u2013 underlined that police violence is an issue in both countries. \u201cPanmela\u2019s graffiti is a megaphone to denounce to the world what is happening in the poorer regions of big Brazilian cities,\u201d said Ricardo Resende, an art critic from Rio."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
