There's a Scotsman, an Australian, a Dutchman and an Englishman playing darts \u2013 and it's the most popular programme on British pay-TV. Except there's no punchline. On 30 December the peak audience for the PDC world championship semi-finals \u2013 677,000 \u2013 left everything else in its tungsten-tipped slipstream. The Simpsons. Scottish football. And, yes, the 1,057th repeat of an Only Fools and Horses Christmas special. True, the Premier League was having a rare breather that day. Even so, the PDC final on New Year's Day was watched by 960,000 viewers \u2013 more than 100,000 more than saw Southampton v Chelsea on BT Sport. Over the festive period satellite TV audience figures settled into a familiar pattern: football first, darts second, the Ashes after that. The second day of the fourth Test, admittedly shown when most were asleep, peaked at 375,000. No one is suggesting that darts has crashed the mainstream but it is having a moment, as it did in the 1980s. Back then it was shunted away after Newsnight; now it is prime time. The first round of the BDO world championship \u2013 yes, it is preposterous that darts has two world championships \u2013 was shown live on BBC1. Last year's final between Scott Waites and Tony O'Shea was watched by 2.2 million people on BBC2. In Alexandra Palace and the Lakeside the sold-out boards have long been up. The irony is that while attending most sports is a viewing enhancer \u2013 in football the eye sees more off-the-ball runs than TV cameras can catch; at ringside the connection of leather on a boxer's skin becomes altogether less abstract \u2013 in darts the action is blurry even before a beverage is sunk. Yet the audiences keep coming. But while darts is increasingly fashionable, there is something reassuring in the way that its stars remain anything but. The PDC champion, Michael van Gerwen, precocious but easily distracted, wears a lime-green top popular only among early-90s ravers. And there are peacocks with less outrageous feathers than the rainbow mohican sported by Peter \"Snakebite\" Wright, who lost 7-4 to Van Gerwen in last week's final. The 43-year-old Scot also has a painted snake on his head, and wears a black shirt with luminous pink, yellow and light blue squiggles, as if trying to channel the opening credits of Top of the Pops circa 1985. Fashions change everywhere, but only in darts do they remain resolutely anti-fashion. But as the PDC has swelled in popularity and size its audiences have changed too. There are fermented chants of \"Boring, boring tables\" from those in the cheaper stands; snide retorts of \"We pay your benefits\" back. It moved from Purfleet to Alexandra Palace for the 2008 world championship but spiritually its home is laddish Essex. Meanwhile the BDO world championship is still adamantly traditional. Gone are the days when smoke would curl up and sleep on the Lakeside's ceilings but the ambience remains working men's club. Doubles on the stage are greeted with applause, not a flub of wolf-whistles and jeers. But the standard is lower: there are fewer see-sawing cries of \"Wann-hunredan'ehtee!\", and averages rarely climb into the 100s. It is the same sport played to different standards. Some, of course, say that darts is not a sport at all. That it involves no more exertion than the 7ft 9.25in walk from toe line to oche. It sounds damning that Waites, the BDO world champion, lost in the first round on Saturday after injuring his back playing dominoes. But in these flexitarian times we should perhaps cut darts some slack. After all, \"sport\" comes from the old French word desporter, meaning \"to exercise or take part in a game\". Darts is recognised by Sport England. Curling and shooting, both of which are Olympic sports, hardly require great athletic prowess either. And those who say darts doesn't make you sweat have never seen Phil \"The Power\" Taylor play a long-setter under lights. Mind you, there is some truth in the famous Not the Nine O'Clock News darts sketch in which Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones score points for sinking beers and spirits. A few years ago Colin \"Jaws\" Lloyd told me that while the players were contractually obliged to drink water on stage they had a \"couple of settlers to rid the nerves\" beforehand. \"It just stops your hand from wobbling,\" he said. \"If we didn't drink it would probably be the end of the sport. There'd be no 180s.\" Can you blame them? Few sports subject the nervous system to such unremitting scrutiny. Every 90 seconds or so a player throws for a double to win a leg or set or match. Imagine the pressure, and consider the television opportunities. Given Barry Hearn's innate feel for razzmatazz how long before players are hooked up to heart-rate monitors during play? But darts doesn't need gimmicks, or people fist-pumping towards the sky while monosyllabically chanting \"Der-der-der-der-der\". Its pleasures come from its purity. Dart and board, eye and nerve. Many still dismiss it as a pub game; a pantomime sport for pantomime season but, like many of its protagonists, it is expanding. And that is no bad thing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
