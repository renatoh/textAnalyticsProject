Mr Rose is a cool, confident operator. But he will have to give the performance of his life if he is to see off retail tycoon Philip Green, who is waving \u00a39bn at M&amp;S's shareholders. As Mr Rose outlines how he intends to restore M&amp;S to its former position as the UK's premier retailer, across the City the head of J Sainsbury will be doing much the same. Lord Levene of Portsoken, temporarily in charge of the supermarket group after the ousting of Sir Peter Davis, will be conducting a shareholder meeting that is likely to be extremely bad-tempered. If the founding family fails to support the directors it could end in the worst defeat for a British board of directors. By the end of the meeting, Lord Levene himself may be out of a job. Sainsbury's may lose a key vote over \u00a32.4m of free shares awarded to Sir Peter this year, despite falling sales and profits. The pay issue will allow shareholders to demonstrate their anger about the dismal overall performance of the grocer. Even though Sainsbury's has said it is taking back the payment to Sir Peter, City investors remain determined to send a message to corporate Britain that rewards for failure will no longer be tolerated. As both retailers endure their public trials, their new executives - Mr Rose and Justin King, the recently appointed chief executive at Sainsbury - may reflect on how different it all once was. Ten years ago, Sainsbury's was Britain's favourite grocer, while M&amp;S was tailor of choice to middle England, purveyor of sensible underwear and first stop for affordable quality. Today, Sainsbury's is down to number three and falling fast. M&amp;S has been caught in a no man's land between discount fashion and label-seeking shoppers in department stores. Even its food halls are no longer unique as chains like Waitrose steal their highest spending customers. As Mr Green, would-be buyer of M&amp;S, said yesterday, today is likely to prove \"a defining moment for the British high street\". Richard Hyman of Verdict Research believes the decline of the two retail empires has been inevitable. \"Both are victims of their own success. For decades, they were regarded by customers and professionals as the leading retailers of the market. \"Both retailers are built on [family] dynasties. That fosters huge continuity. When they are going well that is hugely advantageous. When they start to go badly that is hugely disadvantageous\". Together, they employ 185,000 people, have around 800 stores and a combined turnover of \u00a326bn. The decline of both companies became apparent five years ago, but the rot set in several years before. Both had been family-run and controlled by autocratic bosses. They brooked no dissent and failed to notice that Britain's high streets and shopping habits were changing. For M&amp;S the competition came from clothing retailers like Matalan, Mr Green's Bhs and the supermarket group Asda's George label, which offered the hitherto unachievable combination of low prices and good quality. Sainsbury's faced competition from Tesco and Asda, which upped their game to offer quality food at lower prices. The extent to which Tesco has overpowered Sainsbury's shows through in their profits. Two weeks ago Sainsbury's was forced to tell investors it was going to record \u00a3100m less profit than expected. Its bottom line would be back to \u00a3400m, its worst since 1989. This year Tesco is on course to make \u00a31.9bn. Its market share is 27% and growing, while Sainsbury's stands at little more than 15% and is going backwards. Even today, Sainsbury's insists its food is better, although all the evidence suggests that shoppers see little difference and prefer lower prices. It has missed every grocery shopping trend. While Tesco was pouring money into huge, modern, out of town stores, Sainsbury's stores became run down and shoddy. Sainsbury's scoffed at Tesco's idea for a Clubcard and is still playing catch-up with Nectar. When Sainsbury's planned an expensive internet shopping scheme which required special warehouses, Tesco has built the world's biggest online grocery business by sending staff round existing stores to fill customers' internet orders. Sainsbury's missed the move into non-food ranges like fashion and electricals and has also been left standing by Tesco's drive into corner shops and convenience stores. Dingy The story of decline is similar at M&amp;S. While rival fashion stores spent cash on trendy interiors, M&amp;S stuck resolutely to endless racks of clothes in dingy hangars reminiscent, analysts said, of Soviet Russia. Or, as Mr Green said yesterday, hospitals. \"People don't like going into hospital and they don't want to go into one for a retail experience,\" he said. Its share in the womenswear market has shrunk from 14% to 11% and its once unbeatable childrenswear ranges have lost their way. It has yet to find a way to make its stores as appealing as department stores and fashion outlets. Only recently did M&amp;S deign to accept credit cards. There is much to play for. At Sainsbury, it is down to Mr King, who learned his trade at Asda, and a new chairman, Philip Hampton. But if they cut prices to compete with the big two they will wipe out profits. At M&amp;S there is possibly more to play for. \"The M&amp;S story is one that both Rose and Green agree on,\" said Mr Hyman. \"It is that M&amp;S is worth more than its current rating. It is capable of delivering more. \"Rose is a consummate performer. Stuart has got to deliver. It's going to be fascinating to watch\". If he fails to impress, the future for M&amp;S will be Green."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
