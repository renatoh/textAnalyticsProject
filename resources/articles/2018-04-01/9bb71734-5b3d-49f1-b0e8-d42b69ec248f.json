I didn\u2019t know it would be so violently intrusive into who I am. You\u2019re sailing so close to the storm. You\u2019re playing with a breakdown.\u201d Earlier this month, two years after the award-winning poet, playwright and broadcaster made his compensation claim, and in a last-minute attempt to avoid an expensive court case, the council and its insurer finally agreed to award Sissay a six-figure sum, along with a formal apology. \u201cYou ask for redress because of your own sense of self worth. It wasn\u2019t good enough for me as an artist to go banging on about my story without getting the institution that was my parent to recognise it on its own terms.\u201d Sissay has made several documentaries about the search for his family and his 25-year battle to get hold of his files from Wigan social services. He grew up in care even though his mother, a young upper-class Ethiopian who came to Britain to study, wrote letters begging the council to return her baby once she was better able to look after him. Her requests were ignored. Instead, he was renamed Norman by a social worker called Norman and permanently fostered by a local white family of devout Christians. When Sissay hit adolescence and became a bit rebellious (staying out late, eating cake when he was forbidden to do so), his foster parents told him he had the devil inside him, returned him to Wigan social services like he was an overdue library book and stopped all contact, leaving him isolated from everyone he had ever known. He was 12 years old. Over the next five years, he lived in four different children\u2019s homes, ending up in the notorious Wood End assessment centre, where he says he was imprisoned, bullied and physically abused by staff. At 18, he left the care system, in shock, without a penny to his name or any qualifications. He would not be reunited with his birth mother until he was in his late 20s. \u201cIn the past, reading my files from social services, I\u2019ve said it made me feel like I was a rat in a laboratory experiment. Now, I feel like a lion. I feel like a warrior,\u201d he says. The council\u2019s financial settlement was based on the difference between Sissay\u2019s low earnings for almost two decades after he left care (when he worked, for example, cleaning gutters) and the wage earned by the average UK worker. \u201cThat was the only way the lawyers would calculate it, which is ridiculous,\u201d he says. \u201cHad we not settled, the council would have dragged people from my past into court and argued I was a liar. They were going to get their psychologist on my case: a man who is known for tearing people apart. \u201cThe effects of that could have broken me. I\u2019m aware they already broke me as a kid and so my life as an adult is about acknowledging that and mending. A legal case like this involves digging into the most shameful parts of your past and trying to prove what people did to you. Psychologically, it\u2019s a nightmare.\u201d At the same time, his bid for legal redress was about becoming the man he always knew he was. \u201cInstitutional shame is very powerful, because it is insidious. It works its way into you to make you believe it. A lot of kids in care think they deserve the shit they get. The best thing I ever did was go into therapy.\u201d Battling this irrational sense of shame about what happened to him was one of the reasons Sissay wanted his life story to be investigated by lawyers and shared with the public. Last year, he even decided to share, in a one-off stage performance entitled The Report, the deeply distressing psychologist\u2019s report that his own legal counsel was submitting. \u201cIt has been quite useful to feel supported by a country and I do feel strongly supported now,\u201d he says. But it was a different story when he came out of care and needed help getting on his feet. \u201cThey said: \u2018There\u2019s no dark journey that you\u2019ve been on. Just get on with your life and become a responsible adult.\u2019 Nothing was accounted for.\u201d His going public has allowed other people to bear witness to Sissay\u2019s story, and settling his case means he will finally have full access to his files without any of the redactions that kept names and other secrets hidden from him for years. \u201cMy life is full of known unknowns. When I left care I realised I didn\u2019t know anyone who had known me longer than a year. Making me relative to no one was Wigan council\u2019s biggest crime. So I became the lithograph. I had the negatives of what had happened but nobody else had the picture. I didn\u2019t have witness because witness is what happens in a family.\u201d He says he knew he had to do everything humanly possible to find redress. He had made promises to himself as a child that he had to keep. \u201cLike in Hansel and Gretel, I had laid down pebbles so I could say: \u2018This is the darkest place I\u2019ve ever been, but I\u2019m here and I am a child and here is the pebble.\u2019 I knew I\u2019d come back and shine light into that dark space, that horrible cave, and say: \u2018This is what they did to me.\u2019 The end of my court case is the echo, coming from that cave, out into the bright sunshine.\u201d He plans to use the compensation as a mortgage deposit and, at 50, buy himself a home he can call his own. He also hopes his story will be an example to others. \u201cCouncils have insurance for cases like mine, but I wanted it on their financial records. I wanted them to feel some of the tremor I felt. The child in care is the most ignored child in society.\u201d Every social worker, every psychologist, every foster carer, every cleaner in a children\u2019s home \u2026 Sissay wants them all to know that children in care need them, but equally, they need to be on their game. \u201cIf they abuse us, we are going to come back. And we are going to make them pay for it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
