In that context Discussiontofollow (3.50) is quite well named. More importantly, he is a highly progressive animal who could put the small Bedfordshire yard of Mike Murphy in the spotlight for a day. Much less exposed than most of his rivals, he gives the impression of a horse good enough for this cavalry charge without having yet blown his cover to the extent of having too much weight to carry. A run of three successes was ended at Windsor in April but that really had to count as his best effort to date, since he was a close third despite racing against a significant draw bias. Sent to The Curragh for a valuable pot, he was beaten less than a length after being twice stopped in his tracks. He made up for that when landing an even bigger prize at Ascot last month, despite crossing the entire track from the inside stall. The weights for this race were set by then, so he carries a 6lb penalty, which should leave him very well treated. He looks a Group horse in waiting. Blaine makes some each-way appeal at 25-1. He won the Gimcrack two years ago, struggled last year but now seems to have recovered his form and gives his jockey, Amy Ryan, a fair crack at a big prize. 2.05 Goodwood Charles Hills\u2019s horses have really hit form lately and he won the Molecomb here earlier this week. His Englishman is an unexposed type who may thrive over a strongly run six furlongs. He would not want the ground as fast as it was on Tuesday but it has been repeatedly watered since then. 2.20 Newmarket John Gosden\u2019s fine week may continue with Enraptured, who was keen and then blew up on her reappearance last month, also her handicap debut. She is on the same mark for this return to the course and distance over which she won her maiden last August. 2.40 Goodwood Ed Dunlop might tentatively be described as another trainer finding some sort of form after a first half to the season that was all but wiped out for him by a virus. Oasis Fantasy, who looked a shade unlucky last time, won over this course and distance last month, still looks well treated and has the assistance of Richard Hughes. 2.55 Newmarket The Hamilton maiden won by Enlace is working out and, if making the usual progress shown by Mark Johnston horses on their first outings, she should do well here. 3.15 Goodwood One more success in the Nassau for Sir Michael Stoute would take him level with the record of eight set by the late Sir Henry Cecil and he could get there with Mango Diva. She has been steadily progressive and, while it might be said that she won a weak Group Two in Ireland recently, this is a weak Group One on this occasion. A sound surface suits her well."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
