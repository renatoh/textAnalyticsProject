The potential impact of Brexit on the Square Mile is likely to be a key factor shaping the government\u2019s thinking as it seeks to renegotiate Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU in the coming months. But Vicky Redwood, UK economist at Capital Economics, said her analysis suggested the short-term costs could be outweighed by longer-term benefits. \u201cA British exit from the EU would probably hurt the City in the short term, but it would not spell disaster,\u201d she said in a research note. \u201cThe City\u2019s competitive advantage is founded on more than just unfettered access to the single market. And an EU exit would enable the UK to broker trade deals with emerging markets that could pay dividends for the financial services sector in the long run.\u201d British exports of financial services to the EU were worth \u00a319.4bn in 2013, against imports of just \u00a33.3bn. Redwood warned that up to half of those exports could be at risk in the short term as Britain surrendered the \u201cpassporting\u201d rights that enable UK-based businesses to sell to consumers throughout the EU. However, she insisted that once freed from the fetters of the EU, Britain could make bilateral trade agreements with emerging economies outside Europe, potentially creating lucrative new opportunities for financial services business. \u201cThe City possesses intrinsic advantages, including the UK\u2019s legal system, the English language, a convenient timezone, openness to immigrants, a large pool of skilled labour and a critical mass of expertise in support services such as accounting and law,\u201d she said. Protecting the City\u2019s independence has repeatedly put the chancellor, George Osborne, on a public collision course with his eurozone colleagues in recent years, most notably over the cap on bankers\u2019 bonuses, which was imposed against Britain\u2019s will. Separately, the British Chambers of Commerce published a survey of more than 2,000 business leaders, which shows that while 63% would be minded to vote to remain in the EU if a referendum was held now, as many as half might change their mind, depending on the outcome of David Cameron\u2019s negotiations with his EU partners. The prime minister hopes to win key concessions, including on restricting the freedom of movement of people, enabling him to campaign for Britain to remain in the EU in the referendum he has pledged to hold by 2017. John Longworth, the BCC\u2019s director general, said: \u201cBusinesspeople want more clarity on the prime minister\u2019s renegotiation plans before they have their say on Britain\u2019s future in the EU. With half keeping their options open before making up their mind on how to vote, business\u2019s top concerns need to be at the top of Downing Street\u2019s negotiation agenda.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
