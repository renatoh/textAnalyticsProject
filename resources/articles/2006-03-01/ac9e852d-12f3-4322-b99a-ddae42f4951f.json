The visitors to Highbury should also have departed in just as great amazement. Absurd as it seems after this showing, obscurity somehow does not await them. \"We've still got an opportunity to have our best season since I've been here,\" said the Charlton manager Alan Curbishley, who was appointed in 1991. On Thursday Middlesbrough come to The Valley for an FA Cup quarter-final. Three days later Newcastle, inhabitants of the same congested Premiership mid-table zone, arrive to battle for points Charlton must forget all about Highbury, where slackness in possession sparked Arsenal attacks before Arsenal themselves had the chance to do so. Creative play on their own account was non-existent. If Sven-Goran Eriksson worries that Spurs sometimes leave Jermain Defoe out of their line-up, what would he make of a Charlton side that left Darren Bent out of their attacking moves? When the aspiring England forward ran offside it might have been a plea for attention. Only the victors were worth watching. While they were both at the West End extravaganza Sinatra, Curbishley had told the Highbury vice-chairman David Dein that Arsenal could be the show-stoppers in the Champions League. \"They are playing the football at the moment which they were when they were winning things,\" Curbishley said after Saturday's game. It is a beguiling idea that Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's team, after a barren domestic campaign, may land the greatest trophy of all. With the FA Cup tie in mind, the veteran Chris Powell was used by Charlton for only 16 minutes as a substitute at the weekend and had plenty of breath left to claim that Arsenal, on present form, are \"the best side\" in the Premiership, even if Chelsea's effectiveness is unequalled. In common with everything else of worth on Saturday the scepticism had to come from within Highbury. \"In the second half we forgot the basics of the game,\" grumbled Thierry Henry. Wenger joked ruefully that he would have preferred it if this actually had been the midwinter fixture that the temperature suggested. It is almost spring and with only eight Premiership fixtures left, Arsenal's resurgence could go unrewarded. Powell reflected on the \"massive loss to the country\" if Henry leaves but a move to Barcelona did not seem inconceivable for a forward taking a long look at his career. All the same, there was merriment on Saturday. In the 13th minute Alexander Hleb started a move in which Emmanuel Adebayor linked with Henry before the captain ran past Luke Young to give Robert Pires an easy chance for the opener. The 33-year-old scorer is yet to agree fresh terms. \"If I was in his place,\" said Wenger, \"then I'd also like three years but he will get one. He knows that he'll be part of my plans. I think he'll sign a new contract.\" The manager pointed out that Dennis Bergkamp, almost 37, has been accepting one-season deals since he was 32. The Dutchman has chosen to leave in the summer. \"We have shown,\" argued Wenger, \"that we are loyal to all of our players because [Lee] Dixon, [Martin] Keown and [Tony] Adams all stopped at 36 or 37. There's not many clubs in the world who carry on with their players for as long as that. [Pires] has a choice to make and I hope he will make the right one.\" The midfielder's bargaining position weakens as emerging players develop. Hleb has become influential since striking up an enterprising partnership with Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9 on the right. The Belarus international volleyed the third after two efforts from Emmmanuel Adebayor were blocked. The latter had already claimed his first Highbury goal following a mistake by Hermann Hreidarsson after 32 minutes. Adebayor can be muddled and earlier, when Jon Spector lost the ball, he dithered so that he neither shot nor squared to an unmarked Henry. Nonetheless, it his rangy power that makes him the closest thing to a target man that Wenger will ever contemplate. The manager speaks as if utilising Adebayor's aerial power will be a last resort, but the appreciation from Henry was overt. \"He shields the ball really well and does the 'dirty work',\" said the captain. \"Players like Dennis [Bergkamp], Robin van Persie and myself like to get behind but he waits for others to arrive. We finally have that type of striker we have been looking for.\" On Saturday Wenger's general contentment seemed deepest of all. He virtually admitted to an approach from Real Madrid by remarking, \"It's difficult to find people who don't talk in football, and I talk too much.\" The comment was made lightly but the new project at Arsenal is so engrossing for Wenger that he could not bear to abandon it.
