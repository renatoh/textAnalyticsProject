Milly, our gap-year student is in Australia and has found a place in the middle of nowhere to stay with her boyfriend in the Blue Mountains. \"Catching the train to Katoomba, we arrived, as usual, without having booked anywhere to stay. Finding an advert for a place called Wollangambe Lodge in a backpacker magazine, we gave it a call. After a long chat with the owner Shaun, we realised this place was truly in the middle of nowhere - but we both wanted to give it a try. In fact, it's so remote we were told to bring all our groceries with us, and to request to get off at Bell station, as it is so seldom used. This gave Josh just enough time to try a kangaroo burger at the caf\u00e9 in Katoomba, which was delicious. When we arrived at Bell, Shaun himself picked us up in his van, which rattled as though it would fall apart when it went round the bends. Every hostel is always a new experience, but this one tops the lot. Set deep within the bush in a town that was a once thriving community but now has only five houses, you really couldn't get further away from it all. This hostel had no rules and no key deposit - because there was no key.\" Meanwhile Sam is in New Zealand, where he is hoping things are going to improve, and Sue is enjoying some luxury in Singapore."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
