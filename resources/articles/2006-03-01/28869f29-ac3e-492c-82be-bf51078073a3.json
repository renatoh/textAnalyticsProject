Or my favourite, 'a whirling fusion of colour, no narrative, no beginning or end, simply beautiful and captivating visions that require no specific attention, but are apparent nonetheless'. But the self-conscious trendiness that makes it spurt such guff also leads to fabulous fun. Manager J\u00e9r\u00f4me Foucaud, previously of St Tropez's it-hotel Byblos, oversaw the creation of Murano's semi sci-fi, semi-porno lounge style. Corridors are lit with brothel-red neon lights and filled with bulbous silver sculptures, padded vinyl chairs and Murano glass chandeliers, and in the bedroom, Barbarella's spaceship seems to have landed. There are hairy white curtains, pod seats and a lighting system that alters from pink to green to blue to yellow, or flicks between them like a slow-paced disco. Staying in is like going out. Doors unlock using fingerprint recognition technology, which is tricky to operate but means you don't need to worry about losing your room key. The restaurant is somewhere to be seen, and Julien Chicoisne of the Fermes de Marie in Meg\u00e8ve, and Pierre Auge, formerly of Sketch, have created a menu to complement the bonkers decor. The prawn carpaccio is like spicy snot, but hits include the scrambled egg, of whipped-cream texture and served in a giant eggshell (goose? ostrich? crocodile?), and smoked salmon steak on a slab of slate. The one design faux pas is the lift - its walls are fluffy and swirly in sickening caravan curtain colours. You feel like you've been eaten by a fairground teddy bear. And still no sign of the spa and three pools, which will elevate the hotel to 'urban resort' status. They are yet to be built. The price : doubles from \u00a3250 a night What we liked: the funky OTT decor, the food, staying in here is like going out What we didn't like: the fluff, the promotional poppycock The verdict: a lot of fun if you pack a sense of humour. \u00b7 The Murano Urban Resort, 13 Boulevard du Temple, (00 33 142 712 000; www.muranoresort.com)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
