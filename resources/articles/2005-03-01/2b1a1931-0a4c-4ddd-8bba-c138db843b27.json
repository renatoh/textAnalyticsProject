The Uruguay coach Jorge Fossati said that he would not be lured into a false sense of security by Ronaldo's recent drop in form. \"None of us are daft enough to think that he's going through a bad patch and therefore we don't have to be careful with him,\" Fossati said. If he plays, then he should wear lots of shin pads because it's going to be tough for him.\" Uruguay's captain Paolo Montero, who has played for Juventus for more than a decade, is regarded as one of the world's toughest defenders and holds the Serie A record for red cards. His partner at the centre of the defence, Brazil-based Diego Lugano, also has a reputation for tough-tackling. Uruguay, who have never lost at home to Brazil in a competitive match, are fifth in the 10-nation South American qualifying group with 15 points from 12 games. Brazil are second with 23 points. Chelsea's striker Hernan Crespo, on loan with Milan, has admitted he reached such a low with injuries last season he considered retirement. The Argentinian has been in outstanding form this term, scoring 15 goals in all competitions, but his campaign almost did not happen. \"When I was jumping from one injury to another, I thought about retirement,\" said Crespo in Argentina, where he is preparing with the national squad for today's World Cup qualifying match against Colombia. \"I wasn't able to play two games in a row and that depressed me a lot. I couldn't see any light in the tunnel; I wasn't feeling comfortable with myself. At one point, I thought this June was my deadline.\" The Juventus midfielder Pavel Nedved is likely to return for the Champions League quarter-finals after 40 days out with concussion. Nedved will play in Juve's league match at Fiorentina on Saturday, possibly as a substitute. He hopes to be fully fit for his club's Champions League meetings with Liverpool on April 5 and 13. The Czech international was injured in a collision with Real Madrid's Raul Bravo last month. Lazio averted bankruptcy yesterday by reaching a lastminute deal with Italy's tax authorities on a debt of around 140m Euros (\u00a396m). Lazio said they would pay the debt back to Italy's Tax Agency over the next 23 years. The deal, which was reached just minutes before Lazio would have been forced to file for bankruptcy, sparked immediate controversy, with government coalition party the Northern League complaining of preferential treatment for the Rome-based team."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
