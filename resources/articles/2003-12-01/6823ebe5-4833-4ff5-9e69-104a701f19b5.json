He is just a forgetful lad'", "bodyText": "Manchester United reacted with predictable fury to Rio Ferdinand's eight-month ban for failing to take a drug test. The director Maurice Watkin's condemnation of the penalty as \"savage and unprecedented\" will be mirrored in the insular world of football this weekend. But among the wider anti-doping community there was a sense of satisfaction that the FA had made an example of the most high-profile drugs case in its history. Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, who has been a vociferous critic of the FA's approach to the Ferdinand case, wasted little time in condemning the verdict. \"We knew there would have to be a penalty. But an eight-month ban and \u00a350,000 fine is, I feel, very draconian,\" he said. \"I felt there was every opportunity for the FA to give him the benefit of the doubt. There had to be a penalty, bearing in mind the world pressure, but he has not been given the benefit of the doubt, quite clearly.\" Ferdinand's former manager at West Ham, Harry Redknapp, who submitted a statement in support of Ferdinand to the hearing, said his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 had been punished for nothing more than being absent-minded. Ferdinand has maintained throughout the case that he simply forgot to provide a sample. \"I'm sure in Rio's case, having known him very well, he's not a drug-taker. He's a forgetful lad, to be honest with you,\" Redknapp said. \"I think the ban is a little harsh. If he'd been caught taking drugs I'd have said give him two years, give him three years. He'll obviously be very disappointed. He has a great love of football. He's a fantastic footballer.\" Redknapp predicted that the case would drag on for several months as Manchester United launch an appeal. He called for reform of the FA's doping control regulations, which have been exposed as thoroughly unsatisfactory by the Ferdinand case. \"They should go over and say, 'Rio Ferdinand, you're having a drugs test today and come in and get it done',\" he said. \"It's got to be done on a much more professional basis than it is at the moment.\" John Scott, UK Sports' director of international relations who has taken over responsibility for antidoping operations in the wake of Michele Verokken's departure from the organisation, supported the FA's conduct of the case. \"It's the responsibility of the FA to set the penalty, and while the recommended ban for this sort of offence is two years, they have obviously taken account of the circumstances,\" Scott said. \"Our main concern with any doping offence is that the governing body follows the rules and regulations, and we are very satisfied that the FA has gone through a proper process and a proper hearing.\" The Manchester United captain Roy Keane praised his team-mate's conduct since he missed the test. \"I think it is hard for everyone, not just footballers, to be scrutinised like that, especially when people don't know the ins and outs of the case,\" Keane said. \"But all we can talk about is the way Rio has handled himself. The way he has been playing he has been a credit to himself and to the club. We are all behind him.\" The former United goalkeeper and European Cup winner Alex Stepney said: \"The ban and fine is an absolute disgrace. I am dumbfounded. We all know that Rio has done wrong, but he is not the only one who has made a mistake in this episode. \"Rio should have been fined, but to ban him is ridiculous. For me, his England career has been thrown out of the window with this verdict. \"And what will Sven-Goran Eriksson think? He gave Rio a character reference, but that didn't do him any good.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
