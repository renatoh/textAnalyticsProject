This is Bridget Riley\u2019s signature, tucked modestly round the edge of the canvas, and about the only aspect of her work that never changes. At 88, Riley is still finding new ways to dazzle and exhilarate the eyes and mind with the slenderest of means, each canvas a sustained revelation from a mind that remains forever young. Take a recent work from her Measure for Measure series. At a distance, the coloured discs on the white substrate scintillate like sequins, even in their muted tones of purple, green and brown. Walk closer and the picture performs a new magic. Green dances against purple, which sparks against brown, until the discs seem to jump and shiver; each leaving an afterimage, moreover, where the whole surface seems alive with the glistening patter of raindrops on water. A fourth colour appears in the next version: dull turquoise \u2013 and yet the day brightens. The painting has its own weather. This is a marvel considering all you\u2019re looking at is an array of drab discs on white paint; more extraordinary still, that radiance seems to float free, transmitting its light to another work hanging alongside. Some of this is to do with the complex interplay of optics, colour and perception, of course, and with measurements of all kinds (Riley\u2019s titles are always epigrammatic). But it is an effect scarcely seen in any other artist. This is a stunning lifetime survey, the paintings speaking back and forth over more than six decades, from the coruscating early op-art to the vast, sweeping curves of Riley\u2019s latest murals. One work is even dated 2009-1970, reversing convention to make the point. And in a riveting gallery of early drawings, miniature prototypes and homages to Seurat, Riley goes all the way back to show her workings. In the great all-together-now of her work, every painting seems constantly active, shifting in some continuous present. Even a painting such as Pause doesn\u2019t really stop, but keeps right on happening before your eyes as the grid of black dots flows into a curious dip, and then continues seductively onwards. It is the visual presentiment of a time warp. The permutations of geometric forms are so openly declared, every time, you feel it ought to be possible to deduce the underlying principles. But consider Static, with its deftly punning title. This grid of tiny black ovals \u2013 21 rows of 21, to be exact \u2013 is arranged across a large white canvas. Each oval tilts in a slightly different direction, perhaps according to some fundamental algorithm. But these facts don\u2019t begin to explain the way the eye is sent ricocheting across the painting, nor the peculiar tension between still image and ever-expanding field of vision, nor the electrifying sense of crackle and hum. Parallel curves can shimmer, undulate or pool in swaying eddies. Vertical stripes come in sheaves, glades, bristling pageants. Minute irregularities produce optical flashes, slight overlaps of colour release atmospheric new tints. With a simple array of triangles, black on white, Riley can do painting fast and slow. With a handful of hues she can get mirror-bright silver, or the desert light of ancient Egypt. The intense precision of her art \u2013 its strict formal logic \u2013 seems to allow for a wild, almost synaesthetic freedom. The nap of velvet, autumn smoke, a buzz of high-pitched aggression: people claim to have all sorts of experiences in front of a Riley. No matter how poised, how meticulously calculated, her abstractions are never aloof. And they can be as evocative of nature\u2019s ever-changing effects as old-fashioned Romantic art: dawn mist, sea haar, the shimmer of heat on a summer road. Light fluctuates, as if seen through moving branches, and a dark glow comes off a work called November. The paintings have their individual seasons and climates. Progressing through small rooms to the vast open galleries of the Hayward, this show gives the clearest possible sense of Riley\u2019s abstractions as a form of expression as well as a visual philosophy. Seductive, erotic, piercing, tense, the edginess of the early works gives way to calmer, richer, more contemplative works, a blaze of red gathering speed in a multi-panel painting, the delight of the great outdoors lassoed in whiplash curves. And for anyone trying to suppress the obvious analogy with music, there is that massive canvas called Aria, its high stripes of hot and cold colours rising to a sonorous crescendo. Generally, Riley\u2019s titles stand in relation to the image like titles to a poem. Neither summation nor definition, they do not aim to pin down some elusive meaning. Since nothing in the seen world ever stays still, that would be all against the spirit of her work. And the pleasures of seeing are Riley\u2019s perpetual subject, including the very movements of the eye in all its split-second fits and starts. A painting such as Blaze, with its immaculately graded spirals running in opposing directions, eventually centring on a vanishing point, is like a human eye in itself: lucid, ever-shifting, quick with radiant vitality. Ocular sensation becomes this picture\u2019s adventure. Has any painter ever looked better in the inhospitable canyons of the Hayward Gallery? Riley\u2019s art seems to be made for these colossal spaces, unadorned and without any natural light. Small works draw the eye in sharply with uninterrupted intensity; big works such as the beautiful Late Morning have enough space to exert their full force of personality, emitting a daylight of their own. You can stand a hundred feet away from the biggest of these pictures and witness them like landscape at a distance, and then come close to relish the little local events, much as you would when walking through nature. This perfectly suits some of Riley\u2019s most complicated works, where the intersection of curves and opposing diagonals is almost impossible to follow, still less analyse, yet which seems to yield a surprising succession of familiar forms \u2013 ribbons, flags, kites, curlicues and leaping flames. These shapes appear in one of the show\u2019s final masterpieces, titled Rajasthan, which is painted directly on the wall \u2013 a startling frieze of orange, red and green that rushes upwards like fire. Like so much of late Riley, the vision is grand: a composition that is tightly controlled and yet plainly mysterious. There are hints of Hindu script, of blinding sunshine, blazing heat, perhaps even funeral pyres. The title, the swooping forms and colours: all the associations with place or emotion are there. But they are not the point, so much as the experience Bridget Riley creates for the eye. Here is this magnificent vision \u2013 a dream that appears to float in mid-air, its double reflected in the polished floor below like the Taj Mahal in its pool. The image will vanish when the exhibition ends. It is the perceptual embodiment of a mirage. \u2022 Bridget Riley is at Hayward Gallery, London, until 26 January 2020"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
