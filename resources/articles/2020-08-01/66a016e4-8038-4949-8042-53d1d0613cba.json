A statement from the club confirmed that four players had tested positive for the virus on Tuesday after a first player was identified as having contracted the disease last Friday. Training has been suspended and players, coaching staff and assistants have been quarantined. In addition, the club has decided, as a preventive measure, to stop all activity at the Wanda Alcal\u00e1 de Henares Sports Center, the training base for Atl\u00e9ti Femenino and Atl\u00e9ti\u2019s youth teams, with the entire facility being disinfected. All five positive cases are asymptomatic with the players, who have not been named, isolated in their homes and in contact with the club\u2019s medical staff. The players will undergo new tests in the coming days. Atl\u00e9ti are due to resume their Champions League campaign with a quarter-final against La Liga rivals Barcelona in Bilbao on 21 August. The UWCL is due to be played over nine days with the final scheduled to take place in San Sebasti\u00e1n on 30 August. Glasgow City face German champions Wolfsburg also on 21 August while Arsenal play Paris Saint-Germain and holders Lyon take on Bayern Munich the following evening."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
