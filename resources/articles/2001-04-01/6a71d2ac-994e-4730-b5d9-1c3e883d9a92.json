A multimillionaire American, Mr Mendelsohn failed to achieve the performance criteria of the options plan installed at the time of his appointment - which de pends on the relative performance of the company's shares during the period. Mr Mendelsohn received basic pay of \u00a3632,000 and a \u00a3413,000 payment - of which \u00a3383,000 was described as \"expatriate\" benefits to cover his relocation from the US. That took his cash pay to \u00a31.04m, up from \u00a3976,000 in 1999. He took the helm after the merger between Sun Al liance and Royal Insurance in 1996. A turbulent share price has meant executives have not been paid cash bonuses since 1997, with the exception of Mr Mendelsohn who two years ago received pay of more than \u00a32m. The company said this was to buy him out of a US performance deal. US managers are to benefit from a new stock option scheme."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
