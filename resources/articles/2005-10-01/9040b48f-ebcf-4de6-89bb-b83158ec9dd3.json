The woman, identified only as Fatemeh, was jailed 13 years ago for poisoning a man she says tried to force her to have an affair. 'I had hoped to secure her release but now her case will remain frozen or deteriorate until she shows up,' said Khorramshahi. Iran oil threat Iran may respond by holding back on oil sales if its nuclear programme is referred to the United Nations Security Council, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said. 'If Iran's case is sent to the Security Council, we will respond by many ways, for example by holding back on oil sales,' he told the UAE daily, The Khaleej Times. Yalta revisited The grandsons of Second World War leaders Joseph Stalin, Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill met on Saturday for a debate, 60 years after their grandfathers' wartime meeting at the Yalta Conference. The three grandsons, now elderly themselves, laughed often and argued in a friendly manner, but at times differed sharply about the war and what happened at Yalta, the Ukrainian resort town where the leaders met in February 1945. Yalta divided Europe into what quickly became postwar spheres of influence for Western powers and the communist bloc. Grenade deaths Two young children who found a hand grenade in a field behind their Colombian home were killed when it exploded as they played with it, local police said yesterday. The brothers, aged five and nine, died immediately from the blast in the Andean mountains near the town of Toribio, 250 miles southwest of the capital Bogota. Shrapnel also injured four of the boys' relatives, including a 14-year-old girl and three adults."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
