Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is confident he will be able to sign the Bordeaux forward Marouane Chamakh, a long-term target, under the Bosman ruling in the summer and could rely upon Bendtner to lead the line in the absence of the injured Robin van Persie in the interim. Yet, having been impressed by such players as West Ham's Carlton Cole, Andr\u00e9-Pierre Gignac of Toulouse and the Aston Villa forward Gabriel Agbonlahor, Wenger is prepared to enter the market this month if Bendtner's injury appears likely to persist. \"It depends on Bendtner and how bad [the injury] is,\" Wenger said when asked if he needed to sign a new forward. \"Bendtner is being treated now [in Denmark] and will come back on Friday for us to test him, and we will assess the situation. If he is out for two months, there is no way [Arsenal could not pursue reinforcements] \u2013 we will need someone, absolutely. So the real test will be in the next two weeks with the projection with Bendtner.\" The Denmark forward, who has scored three times this season, has been absent since hobbling from the field in the first half of Arsenal's 3-0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur in October and required a minor operation in Germany on his groin. He has been training in his homeland, gradually stepping up his rehabilitation, in the hope that he might play some part in the game at Bolton Wanderers on 17 January. Arsenal's medical staff will draw their own conclusions later this week, and their assessments will effectively determine the club's transfer policy. Wenger generated more than \u00a330m last summer with the sales of Emmanuel Adebayor and Kolo Tour\u00e9 to Manchester City, suggesting significant funds are in place for him to strengthen mid-season, yet the Frenchman will not pay over the odds. \"It's my responsibility to spend the money in the right way,\" he said. \"Why should I splash out and pay \u00a310m for a player who is worth \u00a35m? There is an abnormality of the market at the moment because one or two clubs don't need to look at the money \u2013 they just put the pressure on everybody else. But it's normal you buy the players for the right price. If [Lionel] Messi is available, maybe you would spend the money. But when you look at the financial situations of many clubs in England, it is because when the income was one, they spent two.\" Wenger, whose side can move to within a point of Chelsea at the top by defeating Bolton at the Emirates tomorrow evening, appears resigned to losing his Spain Under-21 international Fran M\u00e9rida at the end of the season, with the 19-year-old understood to have signed a pre-contract agreement with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. The midfielder has made only three substitute appearances in the league since joining from Barcelona in 2006. \"I don't know, but I fear the worst,\" Wenger said. \"I am a bit disappointed if he has [signed for Atl\u00e9tico]. We have made him an offer which was accepted at the start, but he could never finalise for different reasons. He is at the stage where he wants to play. He needs to play. He is still available to me and I will do what is good for the club until the end of the season.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
