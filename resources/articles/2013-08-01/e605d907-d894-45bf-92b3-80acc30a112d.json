Downing gave short shrift to the idea of joining West Ham when they first made an approach last month. \"It's not something I am going to consider,\" said the winger, whom Liverpool signed for \u00a320m from Aston Villa two years ago. But Liverpool are now known to be prepared to take a massive loss on Downing, who has two years remaining on an \u00a380,000-a-week contract, and that has encouraged West Ham to enter negotiations with Anfield officials. Newcastle United have also made tentative inquiries about taking the Middlesbrough-born player back to the north-east but have other transfer priorities at present. The Liverpool midfielder Jay Spearing has completed a permanent transfer to Bolton Wanderers, where he enjoyed a successful loan spell last season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
