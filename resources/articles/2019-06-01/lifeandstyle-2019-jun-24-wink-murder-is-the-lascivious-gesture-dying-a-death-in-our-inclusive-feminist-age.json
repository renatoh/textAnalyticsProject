Why? We outsiders don\u2019t know, and we are not meant to know. \u201cA wink is all about collusion, and collusion is about exclusion,\u201d says Dr Peter Collett, an Oxford psychologist with an interest in body language. Therefore, the wink, in his opinion, is anachronistic. \u201cIt\u2019s not as prevalent as it used to be because it goes against the tide of the zeitgeist, which is all about not leaving anybody out.\u201d It is true: you don\u2019t see as much winking as you used to, and so a wink today stands out as a flashback to monochrome England, such as when you see someone smoking a pipe, or hear a milkman whistling. As a mode of communication, it seems as quaint as Morse code. I am sufficiently interested in winking to have written a novel about a man who winks at people and then kills them. The novel is set in the 70s, which was a lascivious decade, therefore well stocked with that sort of winker, but the main thing was to set the novel in the past. It seems to me that winking belongs in the past partly because society is increasingly informal, and the winker needs formality in order to have something to undermine. There would be no point winking at someone in the middle of an orgy, for instance. (When I ran this idea past Collett, he said: \u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it, Andrew.\u201d) Perhaps the heyday of winking was in the risque entertainment of a century ago, when comedians tackled social strictures with a sort of constrained rebellion, via such outmoded notions as cheekiness, naughtiness and mischievousness. The ventriloquist\u2019s figure was a \u201ccheeky boy\u201d and a winking mechanism came almost as standard. To quote an Edwardian advertisement: \u201cIn addition to all the ordinary movements, the \u2018Wonderful Boy\u2019 is constructed to laugh, cry, smoke, wink and flap his ears.\u201d On the music hall stage, the wink and the double entendre were natural companions. The singer Marie Lloyd was known for her wink, and in 1895 she had a hit with a song called When You Wink the Other Eye, a title suggesting that winking had reached such epidemic proportions that everyone\u2019s first-choice winking eye had become worn out. The song gets progressively lewder, culminating in a scenario wherein a cash-strapped woman flags down a cab and makes a suggestion to the driver \u2026 \u201cHer purse, alas! Is empty, but somehow she must get there; She whispers something in his ear, then it\u2019s \u2018Drive to Leicester Square.\u2019 \u2018All right \u2013 jump in!\u2019 says cabby \u2013 oh, \u2018Cabby knows his fare,\u2019 For he winks the other eye.\u201d The American silent screen had its famous female winkers. One was Cissy Fitzgerald, who had an involuntary wink in her left eye, which she incorporated into her act. This tic apparently caused her some distress, but it has been suggested that Fitzgerald\u2019s wink also makes her a feminist icon, in that winking was seen as a male prerogative. If the music hall wink was exclusionary, it perhaps excluded the people who merited exclusion: the controlling middle and upper classes; the people not in the music hall audience. In the 70s, my dad was a master of the exclusionary wink from a similarly leftwing angle, in that the person he was excluding tended to be my uncle Peter. Uncle Peter was a Tory and a keen motorist (he owned driving gloves and a car coat), who regularly suggested to my dad \u2013 who worked for British Rail \u2013 that funding for railways should be slashed to the bone. \u201cYou make a good point, Peter,\u201d my dad would say; then he would wink at me, which I found flattering, given that I was only about 10 years old. When I mentioned my dad\u2019s winks to Marina Benjamin, author of feminist titles such as The Middlepause and Insomnia, she was well disposed: \u201cI think that\u2019s nice, as long as the third party didn\u2019t see the wink.\u201d I assured her there was no question of that. We then moved on to the lascivious wink, and she was less indulgent: \u201cThat wink \u2013 the Benny Hill wink \u2013 says to a woman: \u2018You\u2019re game, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 so it\u2019s demeaning because it bypasses all kinds of mutual communication. It is a shorthand by men \u2013 and always men you don\u2019t want to have anything to do with, by the way.\u201d I asked at what point she thought that sort of wink became insupportable. \u201cWhen feminism began,\u201d she said, laughing, which is not to say it has quite disappeared: \u201cIt happens all the time on public transport.\u201d Did Benjamin think women ever winked at men? \u201cPass,\u201d she said. \u201cCan\u2019t think of an example.\u201d Certainly, I have never been winked at by a woman unknown to me. I would have remembered, just as I would have remembered if I had been involved in an earthquake. But I can confirm that men are still winking at women they don\u2019t know because I\u2019ve seen it done. The winker does usually seem a marginal figure, like someone mentally living in the past. The last time I saw a man wink at a woman in a pub, they had been introduced immediately beforehand: that is, the man had marched over and unilaterally introduced himself to the woman, whereupon he embarked on five minutes of boasting, culminating in: \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got a nice new Range Rover for sale around the corner if you\u2019re interested,\u201d followed by the wink. Woody Allen took flak for saying he hoped the allegations against Harvey Weinstein would not lead to a \u201cwitch-hunt atmosphere\u201d in which winking at a woman in the workplace became wholly unacceptable. In response, Peter Bradshaw wrote on this website: \u201cThe only people that can get away with winking are the paradoxically supercool young people on the front of i-D magazine \u2026 Winking went out with cardboard bus tickets.\u201d The middle-aged winker seems to be using the old-media equivalent of the winking emoji or its typographical equivalent ;-). These I have received from women and my pulse rate has remained steady. India Ford is an internationally renowned body language consultant. She suggests that a wink is powerful \u201cbecause it\u2019s a physical signal, and these are more telling than verbal ones; also because it comes from the eyes, and we send more communication with the eyes than any other way. I mean, imagine the effect on you of a very severe eye roll.\u201d Here is an instance of a momentous wink. In the quarter final of the 2006 World Cup, Wayne Rooney committed a foul, and Cristiano Ronaldo urged the referee to send him off, which he did. Ronaldo then winked at the Portugal bench. When the BBC pundits watched the playback, one of them exclaimed off-camera: \u201cHang on \u2013 did he just wink?\u201d It was the wink that made Alan Shearer lose his cool: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Wayne went into the Portuguese dressing room after the game and stuck one on him.\u201d Ronaldo\u2019s wink distorted his beautiful face. A woman I know thinks a man who winks at a woman might be forgiven because he is at that moment sacrificing his good looks (if any); he is making a \u201cfunny\u201d face. In 2014, Elle magazine ran a feature about bad winking and it turns out winking doesn\u2019t suit George Clooney or Catherine Zeta-Jones, for instance. But are these bad winks amusing? It seems clear that one should never use a wink to demand a laugh. Welcoming the Queen to the US in 2007, George W Bush fluffed his lines, saying: \u201cYou helped this country celebrate its bicentennial in 17 \u2026 1976.\u201d He then turned and directed a stage wink at her, as if to say: \u201cI\u2019m a bit of a twit but you don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d Her Majesty remained expressionless. That goes down as one of the more recent examples of a famous wink. Another occurred the following year, when \u2013 to the dismay of her supporters and detractors alike \u2013 Sarah Palin winked three times at the TV camera during a vice-presidential debate. This was a strange wink, in that it was apparently not exclusionary. Palin was presuming to wink at the whole of the US, just as Julian Assange seemed to be winking at the whole of Britain (he was said to have winked at \u201cthe cameras\u201d, plural) when he arrived at court in a prison van recently. Collett says that, since a wink is \u201ca narrowcast communication between me and you\u201d, Assange\u2019s wink was \u201cmisapplied\u201d (which is the least of Assange\u2019s problems right now). But surely winkers deserve some sliver of credit for their boldness? The winker always expresses bravado, no matter how their subtler message might go astray. A wink is a reset or jump cut, and usually a leap in the dark; things will be different after the wink. When Lee Jones, the antihero of my novel, winks at a woman, she asks what it meant, to which he replies: \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see what it meant, shall we?\u201d Andrew Martin\u2019s novel The Winker is published by Corsair."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
