Pardew, 42, resigned yesterday morning because the club refused him permission to talk to West Ham about becoming successor to Glenn Roeder. Shortly after Pardew's announcement, the club chairman John Madejski revealed he had not accepted the manager's decision. Madejski, furious when Mark McGhee walked out for Leicester nine years ago, put first-team coach Kevin Dillon in charge for Saturday's game - ironically at West Ham. \"The manager, Alan Pardew, tendered his resignation, which the board has not accepted,\" said Madejski. The Royals chairman has twice denied Pardew the opportunity to hold talks with the West Ham, relegated from the Premiership in May, and it appears that Madejski's hard-line stance has contributed to Pardew's resignation. Madejski pointed to Pardew's contract which allows him to talk to Premiership clubs, but not those in the First Division: \"Alan Pardew's contract quite clearly states that, if he's approached by a Premier League club, that's fine. But if he's approached by a Division One club, he's not allowed to go as they're considered the opposition.\" But Pardew appears unrepentant and said yesterday: \"I wish to announce my resignation from Reading Football Club with immediate effect. My main issue has always been the opportunity to speak to West Ham United Football Club which has been denied to me.\" West Ham made him their number one target following Roeder's departure in August. He had already revealed he intended to stay away from Upton Park on Saturday: \"Given the fixture, I'll be taking time away with my family over the weekend to consider my future outside of Reading Football Club,\" he said. \"I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the players for all the effort they've given me. Most of all, I'd like to thank the fans for their support over the last six years.\" Pardew's success story at the Madejski Stadium has led to his name being linked with several managerial vacancies. The man who has come to be regarded as one of the brightest managerial prospects outside the Premiership stepped up from reserve manager in 1999 and guided Reading out of the Second Division in 2002. Their improvement continued last season and they reached the First Division play-offs, only to lose to Wolves, who went on to be promoted. The Ipswich manager Joe Royle has bolstered his midfield with the signing of the Charlton midfielder Chris Bart-Williams on a one-month loan deal. The 29-year-old has struggled to make an impression at The Valley and only made seven Premiership starts for Charlton last season. Fabrizio Ravanelli has been training with Coventry City and has opened discussions about a move to west midlands club. The Coventry chief executive Graham Hover confirmed negotiations over a contract have started with the 34-year-old former Italy international, although he also suggested wages could provide a stumbling block: \"We have been in talks with him but the club will not break its wage structure to bring Fabrizio to Highfield Road.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
