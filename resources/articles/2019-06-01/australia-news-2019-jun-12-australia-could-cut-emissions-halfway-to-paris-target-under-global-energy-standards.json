From new hot water heaters to better standards for appliances, a new report has found Australia is missing an opportunity to \u201ceasily\u201d meet its emissions targets and fight the looming climate crisis. The report, from the Energy Efficiency Council (EEC), found that adopting the measures used in Germany would save the average Australian household $790 a year on power bills. It would also create 70,000 extra fulltime equivalent jobs \u2013 from advanced engineering to plumbing \u2013 as houses are fitted with new boilers, draught-sealing and new lights, and factories invest in efficient equipment. A YouGov survey commissioned by the EEC found that \u201cinvesting in energy efficiency\u201d is one of the most politically popular actions the government can take on the climate crisis \u2013 with more than 85% support among both Labor and Coalition voters. However, Australia is not on track to meet its target of a 40% increase in efficiency by 2030, according to the EEC\u2019s head of policy, Rob Murray-Leach. Since 2015, Australia has only improved an average of 0.7% a year, according to the EEC\u2019s figures \u2013 well below the 2.3% rate needed. Murray-Leach said the levers of change were controlled by the states and territories \u2013 meaning Australia could still \u201ccrack on\u201d even if the federal government was inactive. The report said Australians should start thinking of energy efficiency as a form of energy generation \u2013 adding capacity to the grid and reducing power bills. \u201cEnergy efficiency is just another form of supply,\u201d Murray-Leach said. \u201cWhen I look at Germany, their bills are 30% lower\u201d. According to the report, Australia has \u201cbarely begun to tap the potential of energy efficiency\u201d, and was the worst developed country for efficiency, out of the top 25 energy-consuming countries. In comparison, China set a target of 20% improvement in only five years between 2006 and 2010, and exceeded it. And California in the 1970s generated the equivalent of two new nuclear power plants of energy, just by improving the efficiency of fridges. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I went overseas that I realised how far behind we were,\u201d Murray-Leach said. \u201cWe have fundamentally dropped the ball on what is seen as the standard way of how you do business. It\u2019s like every other country in the world did accounting, and we just didn\u2019t bother.\u201d The report found that adopting best practice from around the world would \u201ceasily deliver half of the abatement required to meet Australia\u2019s target to reduce emissions by 26-28% by 2030\u201d. And that push would create 120,000 fulltime equivalent jobs, up from the current 50,000. \u201cA lot of energy efficiency jobs are not labelled energy efficiency jobs,\u201d Murray-Leach said. \u201cIt\u2019s a builder who 20% of his time is making sure the doors and the roof are keeping the heat in \u2026 It\u2019s a lot of different jobs making things work better. \u201cIf you are upgrading the efficiency of a factory, you are getting highly skilled chemical and mechanical engineers to go in. If you are talking about draught-proofing a home, you are talking about a skilled tradesman. And if you are increasing the replacement rate of hot water, then those are plumbing jobs.\u201d The report also recommended Australia improve minimum standards for appliances, and implement an energy rating scheme for houses. Australia currently has minimum standards set for 21 kinds of appliances \u2013 much less than our biggest trading partners, the US (with 51), the EU (41) and China (also 41). Simply matching those standards would boost trade as well as energy conservation, the report said. In the US, California also updates its building codes every three years to keep new buildings energy efficient. If Australia copied the same building codes as the US or Japan, an office building in Brisbane would be 20% more energy efficient, the report found. It also recommended that houses be given energy efficiency ratings in the same way appliances are, so new buyers and new renters can see how much money they would lose by choosing an energy inefficient home \u2013 a scheme the UK has had since 2007. \u201cThe research has shown you could easily double energy productivity \u2013 so a 100% improvement by 2040, instead of a 40% increase by 2040,\u201d Murray-Leach said. Californian energy commissioner Andrew Mcallister told Guardian Australia \u201cthere is a lot of low-hanging fruit in Australia, that in California we have already harvested\u201d. \u201cEnergy efficiency advocacy is not really a radical thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is rational, it is good policy. It is not a partisan thing at all. It\u2019s just good management.\u201d Murray-Leach said much of this could be achieved without the federal government. \u201cThe levers for energy management really sit in the hands of states and territories,\u201d he said. States have the power to institute energy-efficiency schemes (which currently exist in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the ACT), can establish new building standards for homes and fund businesses to improve their own efficiency, as has recently happened in NSW. \u201cQueensland can put in an energy efficiency scheme, it can introduce one tomorrow,\u201d Murray-Leach said. \u201cBusinesses would prefer to have a national approach to these polices. But the states can coordinate with each other without the federal government. And the cost of inaction would be far worse than being uncoordinated.\u201d The report also recommends that manufacturing businesses be given incentives and grants to improve efficiency, and that the government introduce stronger fuel-efficiency standards for vehicles."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
