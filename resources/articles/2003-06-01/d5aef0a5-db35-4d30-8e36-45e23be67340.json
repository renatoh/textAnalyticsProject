FROM WESTMINSTER The Backbencher asked Patrick Wintour, the Guardian's chief political correspondent, what a reshuffle later this week might bring. \"This is the second round of reshuffle fever we've had in the past two or three months, but it looks like there is definitely going to be one this week - the prime minister's spokesman and the prime minister himself have not done a great deal to disguise the fact that it's about to occur, and the special advisers' network is humming with stories, rumours, and people ringing each other up trying to find out who they think is up or down. \"One of the many rumours circulating is that the Scottish and Welsh secretaries' posts could be merged - possibly with that of the Northern Ireland secretary too - making a single post responsible for the devolved assemblies. There are flaws in this, one of which is that the road to devolution in Northern Ireland is again stuck. But if it were possible, that would free Helen Liddell, the current Scottish secretary, and Peter Hain, the Welsh secretary, to do other things. \"The other big point of interest is whether there will be a 'ministry of justice' for the first time, which would in a sense enhance the powers of what is currently the Lord Chancellor's Department and diminish those of the Home Office. It has been a long-standing view in Downing Street - irrespective of who is home secretary - that the Home Office is a monolithic disaster. It has quite simply got too many tasks. The proposal is to change to a continental-style model where you have one department responsible for catching criminals and another responsible for prosecuting them. So criminal law would be taken away from the Home Office and given to an enhanced ministry of justice. \"Entwined with that is the question of what to do with the current lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, who has been there for the whole duration and is said to be getting tired and running out of steam. It's not clear whether he is planning to stand down as part of this reshuffle, but if he were it would give some room for manoeuvre. \"And that's something the prime minister lacks. He has had a lot of enforced reshuffles, such as the ones after the resignations of Stephen Byers and Peter Mandelson (twice), so there are a lot of cabinet ministers who have not been in their posts for long. Blair must decide whether to shift people like Patricia Hewitt, who has been at the Department of Trade and Industry for two years, as well as lower-rung figures such as Margaret Beckett, who has been a very safe pair of hands at the enhanced ministry for agriculture. \"None of these decisions are easy, and I don't think that there is anyone in the cabinet at the moment who is massively under-performing. However, there is a perception that this government lacks a strong second term theme, and a reshuffle might help give it some fresh momentum. \"Lower down, I think there is going to be quite a lot of chopping and changing among the ranks, and one thing we tend to look at each year is whether the supporters of Gordon Brown have done as well or as badly as they did previously. The big players have their entourages, and Mr Brown is no exception. \"I don't think this is going to be the most gripping reshuffle we've had, but it's one which certainly dominates thinking on the Labour backbenches - particularly after six years in government, when MPs come to realise they're going to be passed over for good. Then there is the problem of growing numbers of former ministers on the backbenches. That makes the life of the whips ever more difficult.\" PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS Matthew Tempest reports on Iain Duncan Smith's attempts to taunt Tony Blair over the euro. NEWS ROUND-UP Neither the PM nor Alastair Campbell will appear before the foreign affairs select committee inquiry into WMD, Tony Blair told the Commons. The private sector needs to adopt a new public service culture that places the customer first, the head of Capita said today. The government has announced its plans to reform UK pensions and tackle the savings crisis. ALL CHANGE Page six of Gordon's national changeover plan - and the Backbencher really can't believe you didn't get that far - introduces a very special family. Bill and Penny Sterling own a corner shop. What are they to do with their \"pound basket\" for damaged stock? \"Four months before E day, they amend the handwritten sign 'Everything in this basket for GBP' to show a euro equivalent price in brackets. They need to consider what euro price they will choose after E day ... Bill and Penny decide to use one euro. That way, their customers will receive even better value for money.\" What a marvellous example of counter-inflationary prudence! Next week in the Backbencher: what happens when their student daughter Angela, like so many university-educated women, \"begins to panic\" a week before E day. LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION Congratulations to the winner of last week's competition. John Suett correctly told us that the cost of Defra's rebranding was GBP329,000, plus an extra GBP200,000 for signage. Some readers put it at GBP137,150, but that was the price quoted back in January. Another reader, who used to work at DCMS, told the Backbencher that before the arrival of pre-printed stationery the true cost was even more oblique: \"Overall, the cost of the IT upgrades [to generate the old-style letterheads] was something like five times the answer given to parliament, although I doubt ministers were ever aware of that.\" Corrections and clarifications: \"Without wishing to be considered one of those beardy, Points of View-watching, anathema-to-Charles-Clarke-esque people, I think your emperor's name is Antoninus Pius, rather than Pius Antoninus. (Not a criminal mistake, it's true, but it's important to get the little things right.)\" THIS WEEK'S COMPETITION In the first of an occasional series, the Backbencher would like to draw readers' attention to this charming snap of Alan Duncan showing William Hague and Ffion his big gun. Readers are invited to speculate on what the MP for Rutland was telling his former leader; the best suggestion will win a beautiful copy of Anne Perkins' authorised biography of Barbara Castle, Red Queen, courtesy of Macmillan and available at Amazon.co.uk. Meanwhile, if you want to bring a particularly striking photo of an MP to the Backbencher's attention, email backbencher@guardianunlimited.co.uk. The only condition is that it must appear on an MP's website. Submissions published by devolved members and MEPs are, of course, also eligible. OUTDOOR BLOGS Reluctantly, the Backbencher dragged herself away from Tom Watson's blog this week to read the musings of the man Tom describes as \"Britain's first blogging councillor\", Stuart Bruce. Stuart, who is the lead member for customer services, has had a \"very, very busy\" few weeks. \"I'm chasing up the six new litterbins which we'd been promised would be put up in April,\" the Pepys of the south Leeds suburbs informs his readers. \"There is also a need for grass cutting, hedge trimming and a general clean up in the village.\" Stuart, you're wasted on Middleton. MORI OR LESS A candidate for 2003's Dodgiest Opinion Poll reaches the Backbencher. \"There is now 100% certainty that Labour will lose the next election if Blair remains leader,\" Paul Keyes, of the International Market Research Group predicts, adding cheekily: \"There is a strong chance of a hung parliament.\" Incendiary stuff. The Backbencher calls Paul to confirm that 91% of the respondents didn't trust Tony. How were these \"10,000 Labour voters\" from \"100 traditional Labour constituencies\" selected? \"In the street, out shopping,\" he explains. Ah. And how can you be so certain that Blair will lose the next election based on a mid-term poll? \"That's a very good question,\" Paul admitted. \"Obviously that's for an election now. You can't really strictly say that it will happen in the election, but that's what we feel is likely.\" Paul refused to be drawn on who commissioned the survey, but says the results will shortly be appearing in \"a number of major European magazines\". Interestingly, the poll also finds that 64% of the survey would vote Labour again if Gordon were in charge. Who could possibly be behind it, the Backbencher wonders? CRAZY ABOUT ARI It's not too late to send your tributes to the departing White House spokesman at the Ari Fan Club. \"Just a note to congragulate you [sic] on keeping your cool during your news briefs when I feel as if you would like to jump down on some of those reporters and rip their tongues out,\" one devotee writes. \"These reporters that ask the same unanswerable stupid questions over and over should not be allowed to waste our time and should not be allowed to return to future briefings,\" agrees another fan. Who needs a free press when you've got Ari? EXPRESS DELIVERY A brief note of congragulation to Nick Palmer (Labour, Broxtowe) who has managed to extract an apology from the Daily Express. \"After a little pushing and the involvement of the PCC, I managed to get them to publish a 'clarification' on Monday on the letters page,\" Nick writes. \"The [page one] headline 'MAD NEW LAWS TO PROTECT BURGLARS' didn't, ahem, mean that any new laws were actually being proposed ...\" RAISING THE RIGGING News reaches the Backbencher of an audacious plan to sabotage the Daily Mail's referendum on a euro referendum tomorrow. (No, not the one mentioned in the Guardian's Diary today, although Backbencher readers are also urged to ignore the temptation to vote No at DailyMail.co.uk). \"The BNP is pleased to be backing the Daily Mail's EU constitution referendum campaign,\" the party's website reveals. \"But we have to say that, as a test of public opinion, it is seriously flawed.\" The BNP has a better idea. Supporters are urged to visit the Mail's designated \"polling stations\", explain that they are \"working with the Pro-Democracy League\", and ask the owner's permission to place a separate ballot box next to the Mail's. They should then print off around a thousand copies of a special ballot paper - which makes no mention of the BNP's involvement - and post them through each letterbox in the area. It's a scheme worthy of Zanu-PF at its most ingenious, and the Backbencher is unsurprised to see the BNP adopting the kind of techniques beloved of election-riggers everywhere. WATCH OUT, GIRLS Last-minute jitters no doubt prevented Tatler magazine from putting the member for Mid-Sussex on its cover this month, and the man with Westminster's biggest wardrobe had to be content with a \"Fatty Soames - the last grandee\" coverline. Still, it was a relief to hear that the \"jolly good fellow\" has lost most of his antipathy for female MPs, describing Yvette Cooper as \"a good egg\" and praising Oona King and \"clever, sparky girl\" Bridget Prentice.
