He plans to use the next year to examine ways of controlling entry to the 1,000-acre site. Mr Eavis also faces legal action from Mendip district council over last year's Glastonbury. Mendip believes the festival organiser allowed the number of people attending the event to get out of hand, and is currently going through the process of prosecuting him for breaking the terms of his licence. Licensing the Glastonbury festival could be considered one of the least enviable tasks in local government. Every year Mendip district council has to ensure that this behemoth of a pop festival, licensed for 100,000 people last year, but attracting many more, is a safe and enjoyable experience for both fans and local people. If the council gets it wrong, it is likely to draw flak from residents, festival goers, or both. Mendip's public protection manager Colin Elstob today defended the council's decision to prosecute: \"We are in agreement with the police that Michael did not have control over the site last year, and that's a condition of the licence. We're doing this for perfectly laudable reasons - to improve public safety.\" He pointed out that if people were to die on site, the council would probably be blamed. The Glastonbury festival represents an incredible logistical challenge, and problems at the festival could mean problems for the south-west region as a whole. On hot days, said Mr Elstob, \"people drink water on the site faster than we can pump it in\". If only a small proportion of those at the festival become dehydrated, the number of casualties could inundate hospitals. The number of festivalgoers also creates the potential for injuries due to crowd crushing, and inadequate facilities mean some fans use areas on and around the festival site as impromptu toilets, creating a health hazard. Mr Eavis plans to revive the festival in 2002, but Mendip first wants to see detailed plans for the problems next year's festival might throw up. It will be working with the police to draw them up. The Glastonbury festival may once have epitomised the free spirit of the 1970s, but if it wants to survive in the 21st century, it will have to satisfy the spirit of the licensing regulations set by its local council.
