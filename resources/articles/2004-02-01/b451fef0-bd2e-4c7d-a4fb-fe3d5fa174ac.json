Its survey of voters' intentions found that Mr Kerry was leading his main rival for the nomination, Senator John Edwards, by 66% to 14%. The two senators - Mr Kerry, from Massachusetts, and Mr Edwards, from North Carolina - face what could be a decisive day of voting on March 2, when Democratic presidential primaries take place in New York and nine other states. The nomination has been a two-horse race since former Vermont governor Howard Dean on Wednesday announced that he was pulling out, having failed to win a single primary and caucus. The telephone poll of 404 likely Democratic primary voters was conducted from Tuesday to Thursday this week. The Marist College Institute claims that it has a sampling margin of error of plus or minus 5%. However, the poll found that only 50% of New York State Democratic primary voters were \"strongly committed\" to a candidate for the party's nomination to challenge for the presidency. Other findings revealed that 27% said they \"somewhat\" supported their choice, with 22% indicating they could vote differently on primary day. Just over 52% of those who said they supported Mr Kerry were firmly committed to him, according to the poll. The results showed that Mr Kerry had widened his lead since another poll of Democratic voters in New York was published by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute last week. That showed Mr Kerry leading the pack with 48% of likely Democratic primary voters supporting him, while support for Mr Edwards stood at 7%. While Mr Edwards has said that he expected to do particularly well in upstate New York, where manufacturing job losses have been heavy, the Marist poll found Mr Kerry well ahead - 70% to 14% - in that traditionally more conservative region. Super Tuesday is seen as the key date in the election calendar. Because of the number of delegates at stake in the 10 state primaries that day, it should be decisive in the selection of the Democratic party's presidential candidate. As a result, next week's caucuses in Hawaii and Idaho, and a primary in Utah, appeared to have been largely overlooked. Although local activists are urging people to get out and vote, the lack of interest shown by media and politicians in the states has led to the opening of what the New York Times refers to as \"a kind of Bermuda Triangle\" in the primary season - \"a mysterious warp into which entire states disappear\". This outlook is borne out by the fact that no candidate has run a single television or radio advertisement in any of the three states, none has visited any of them in recent months, and not one has a visit firmly scheduled. In fact, as the Times remarks, there have been two cancelled visits in the last few days. Presidential election poll John Kerry: 55% George Bush: 43% Other: 0% Neither: 1% No opinion: 1% Full results: USA Today/CNN/Gallup The latest presidential election poll shows that Mr Kerry has increased his lead over the incumbent president, George Bush, to 12%. Last week's ABC News/Washington Post poll showed that Mr Kerry was on 51% and Mr Bush on 43%. According to the USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll of 1,006 adults across the US, Mr Bush is trailing both the leading Democrat candidates by double figures. In a head-to-head with Senator Edwards, according to the survey, which was published yesterday, Mr Bush would lose 54%-44%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
