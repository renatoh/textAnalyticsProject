His warning comes as an all-party committee of MPs condemns the tax, designed to encourage people on housing benefit to move to smaller properties, as a blunt instrument that is causing severe hardship for the disabled. In a speech that will distance the Lib Dems from the controversial tax, Farron condemns what he describes as attacks on the poorer members of society. \"The onslaught of divisive rhetoric that demonises the poor can never help us to create a fairer society,\" he will tell the Centre for Social Justice. \"The bedroom tax causes huge social problems and distorts the market \u2013 we as a party cannot support this.\" In the autumn the Liberal Democrat conference agreed to review the bedroom tax, and the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, said at the weekend that he would look at giving councils greater flexibility in providing discretionary support for specific hardship cases. Farron's pledge to oppose the bedroom tax consciously goes beyond existing Liberal Democrat and coalition policy. Labour has already said it opposes the bedroom tax, the one welfare reform it has pledged to overturn in government. The Conservatives argue that the tax, a reduction in housing benefit for people with spare rooms, will free up larger properties for people living in overcrowded housing. But critics argue there is insufficient smaller accomodation available in many council areas and that tenants are being evicted as the reduced housing benefit means they can no longer afford the rent. A report by the work and pensions select committee, which includes five Tory MPs, says the bedroom tax \"is having an impact especially on those living in adapted accommodation, or who need an extra room as a result of their disability, and who are unlikely to be able to move house or enter work. There is evidence that many of these people are suffering financial hardship.\" The report published on Wednesday suggests ministers should carry out a detailed assessment of the available social housing stock in each local authority area. If there is clear evidence that there is insufficient smaller housing stock for tenants to move into, and those who are willing to move cannot do so, the government should consider allowing affected households more time before any benefit reduction is applied, it says. \"Where a household is under-occupying but there is no suitable, reasonable alternative available, the reduction in benefit should not be applied,\" the committee says. The committee is also concerned that private sector landlords are increasingly reluctant to let to tenants in receipt of housing benefit and to provide temporary accommodation, and that many of the private rental sector properties that do remain affordable to housing benefit recipients are of poor quality. \"We recommend that the government works closely with private sector landlords to address their concerns and provide greater support to landlords. However, we are concerned that, for some recipients of housing benefit, rents are becoming increasingly less affordable in the private sector,\" the committee says. Farron also makes a wider argument for politicians to do more about the housing crisis in the UK. \"Even the most cowardly and cynical of politicians ought to start to pay attention to the plight of the priced out, at least on a national level. History has turned. Generation Rent is not a twentysomething problem. They are a growing army and they are will take the side of anyone who has the backbone to stand up for them. This Generation Rent could be a key group in the 2015 election.\" He also calls on his party to be clearer about giving councils powers to build and to borrow to build. He will say: \"Let's unleash the power and ambition of councils and housing associations. The housing crisis has stirred up radical thinking and housing associations are champing at the bit to build. Councils are crying out for more powers to deliver. Let's stop shackling them and letting them stagnate, and give them the freedom to act \u2013 not least because in order to build communities, we need to trust the people who know their local communities best.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
