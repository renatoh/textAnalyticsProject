Their charity did not ended there, and Gareth Edds put the ball into his own net after 48 minutes to set Wolves on their way to a 2-0 win. \"I don't think my team lost their discipline, we just committed suicide,\" said David Platt, after Andy Johnson was sent off just before the break for punching Kevin Muscat in the face and Marlon Harewood received a second caution in the 89th minute. Preston moved above Forest in eighth after a 2-0 win at Selhurst Park which left Crystal Palace firmly back in the relegation mire. Tranmere, ahead of Sunday's FA Cup quarter-final against Liverpool, dropped back to the bottom after turning a 1-0 half-time lead into a 3-1 defeat by Crewe. \"We've got to concentrate on getting points in the league,\" said John Aldridge. \"People have asked all season why we play so well in the cups and not in the league, but I can't answer that. I've said it before but it's driving me mad.\" Reading were the big winners of the weekend in the Second Division, beating their promotion rivals Rotherham 2-0 while all the clubs above them dropped points. Wigan were particularly poor, failing to break down a limited if hard-working Swindon side in a 0-0 home draw. The visiting manager Andy King enthused: \"We were awful today but at least we battled. Last week we were just awful.\" Carlisle remain marooned on the bottom of the Third Division after Darlington inflicted their seventh home defeat of the season, 2-0. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
