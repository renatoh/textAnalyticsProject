Most of us have experienced the horror of realising that a hasty reply, sent in anger or carelessness, has gone to the wrong person or should never have left your inbox in the first place. The portable Blackberry emailer - the gadget that communicated Campbell's electronic faux pas - has become the gadget of choice for British business executives, allowing hard-pressed managers to view and respond to their emails anywhere. But the device - dubbed the \"Crackberry\" by email addicts who cannot resist checking for new emails every few seconds - multiplies the chances of sending something inappropriate to your boss, colleague or - even worse - a journalist by making email utterly inescapable and raising people's expectations of an instant reply. So how does one navigate the minefield of workplace email communication, whether by Blackberry or old-fashioned Microsoft Office? After more than a decade of using email, I have established my personal email diktat: 1. Think before you send every email: would it be quicker, more efficient, and more friendly to phone or even walk over to the person and talk to them in person? But do use email when you want to keep a record of your own or someone else's words. 2. If you're emailing Doris in accounts, don't cc your message to everyone in the company just so you can share your razor-sharp witticism about P60 forms with 200 people. It wastes bandwidth (a measure of the amount of data that can be transmitted by your email network at any time), clogs up other people's inboxes and ultimately, isn't that funny. In fact, people will hate you for it. 3. Don't let your email inbox overflow. Try to deal with every email as soon as possible by responding to the message, deleting it, flagging it for attention later or filing it away. This is where a Blackberry can be invaluable, allowing you to use idle moments on the train or bus tend to the pile of non-urgent but still important email that gathers in your inbox each day. But never, ever, check your Blackberry during a conversation or, even worse, during a meeting: you're effectively telling whoever you are talking to that whoever has just sent you a message, they're bound to be more interesting or important than they are. It's unprofessional to twiddle your scroll wheel under the table, and it's no excuse to say \"everyone else does it\". 4. Don't send email attachments unless you absolutely have to. They eat up bandwidth and often can't be opened by other people. Could you place the document on a server that everyone can access or add the text to the body of the email instead? 5. Don't forward every \"hilarious\" jpeg/virus warning/chain letter you receive from friends to everyone in your address book. If it's a virus warning it's probably a hoax, and if it's that funny, most people will already have seen it. If you must, limit your forwards to a few close friends and clearly mark your email as frivolous spam in the subject line. Ignore this rule, and people will begin ignoring every email that you send - including the important ones. 6. Always include an informative subject line in your email: this helps your colleagues to locate salient emails in their inbox and gives them an idea of how important your message is, so they can read the message marked \"your pay rise\" before the one called \"has anyone seen my X Files mouse mat?\" 7. Avoid bitching about colleagues to other members of staff via emails: the old adage that if you wouldn't write it on a postcard, don't write it in an email: this is even more salient now that the new freedom of information laws have come into force. Many firms monitor staff email usage and you never know when someone could be reading messages over your shoulder. And it is all too easy to hit the reply button rather than forward and end up sending your Campbellesque rant to the very person you are moaning about. 8. Before you fire off an angry email to someone, save the message on draft and take half an hour (or a day if you're really angry) to let yourself cool down. Then take another look at the message and decide whether to send, edit or delete it. 9. Make every email you send count: don't rush a message off in 10 seconds, even if you can send messages from your mobile or Blackberry from anywhere in the world. And if you're saying anything important or controversial, double check which names are in the subject line before hitting send. Spelling mistakes, sloppy grammar and half-formed sentences make you look slapdash and possibly slightly unhinged. Having said that, each company has its own unwritten rules about the degree of formality required in electronic communications: work out what they are and follow them. 10. And finally, be forgiving of colleagues' email faux pas. If a colleague sends you an email that you deem to be rude, just remember that tone is completely lost in electronic communications, and it may be that they were trying to be funny or simply rushed off a message in a moment of anger and instantly regretted it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
