He replied: \"Jesus Christ, because he changed my life.\" Nine years later, with the benefit of hindsight, that appears to be the most honest and revealing thing W said about himself. The answer lays bare his evangelical Christian idealism: the twin assumption that there is a direct connection between him and Jesus, and when change is sanctified by Christ it inevitably leads to good. One can see how easily such a framework could be subverted by chamelonesque political operatives (Cheney), lobbyists (oil), or the illusions of grandeur (the belief that history will ultimately judge him favorably). As long as W could be convinced that he was being guided by Jesus, who, being God, presumably only brought good to the world, everything from torture, invasion and breaking the law, could be legitimised. Not only that, but all such acts could be garbed in moral clothing: humanitarian intervention, national security and democracy promotion, for example. I bring up this connection between politics and evangelical Christianity not to raise the spectre of Christianism (that's another discussion) but because during the run to the 2008 election, Barack Obama also named his favourite philosopher, and it was also someone who comes from the evangelical Christian tradition. In Obama's case, the person is Rienhold Niebuhr, arguably the pre-eminent theologian of the 20th century. Obama's connection to Niebuhr, though, renders him worlds apart from George Bush. Rather than an unfettered idealist, Niebuhr was a Christian realist. Christian realism is a theory propounded by Niebuhr which is of considerable importance in politics because it starts from the premise that the proverbial status quo in a society is one of hypocrisy. (Think of Christian realism as a form of original sin for society: the political animal is debased and immoral to begin with so let's not give him unfettered powers). People of such lowly inclinations, Christian realism argues, couldn't be allowed to go unchecked in the political realm because they would begin playing God. Deep in the darkest days of the Bush presidency, Arthur Schlesinger Jr gave perfect articulation to Niebuhr's vision of Christian realism: Americans are never safe 'against the temptation of claiming God too simply as the sanctifier of whatever we most fervently desire'. This is vanity. To be effective in the world, we need 'a sense of modesty about the virtue, wisdom and power available to us' and 'a sense of contrition about the common human frailties and foibles which lie at the foundation of both the enemy's demonry and our vanities'. None of the insights of religious faith contradict 'our purpose and duty of preserving our civilization. They are, in fact, prerequisites for saving it'. Such a vision for America, in which the country stops rolling dice to determine everyone else's fate, both domestically and internationally, is perhaps best for the world. And it is a cause for hope that Obama ascribes to this philosophy. One intriguing thing about Obama's reference to Niebuhr is that it means that Obama's invocation of Christianity passes through an intermediary \u2013 a seminarian and thinker \u2013 and doesn't go straight to Jesus Christ (as was the case with Bush). Obama, being a church-going Christian, could have easily said that his favorite philosopher was Jesus. Yet he didn't. This demurrer suggests an act of humility on Obama's part. There is a deference to the hierarchy and authority of church wisdom. It would not be unreasonable to assume that this bodes well for his how seriously Obama might take judicial precedence, international norms and the rule of law. Niebuhr should be credited for this restraint. There is, however, a grey area, because during his life, Niebuhr went from being a pacifist to what we'd today call a muscular interventionist, perhaps even a liberal hawk. He gave up membership in socialist groups and became a loud advocate for \"just war\" and participating in the second world war. From then on Niebuhr supported Harry Truman (whom Bush looks up to because Truman's military decisions were ultimately vindicated by historians) and ended up influencing men such as senator Hubert Humphrey, whom some people link to neo-conservatism. Indeed, given the way that at times Obama tried to out-hawk McCain and Hillary (by promising strikes in Pakistan before back-peddling and then promising to double the troops in Afghanistan than what McCain recommended), there is some suggestion that Obama may hail from this side of Niebuhrism. In fact, a little research reveals that the US military has plenty of minds at work that are able to reconcile Christian realist theory with the so called war on terror (pdf). Such theoreticians read Niebuhr to mean that since all men are more or less equally capable of evil, only those who have God in their heart are entitled to use just force. (Of course, who is closer to God is not really an objective standard as history gives ample evidence that people who profess God are capable of military excess; besides its very easy for the God fearing to imagine that the people they dislike have lost sight of God). Right now it is unclear at which point on the Niebuhr line Obama will decide to put down his mark. Wherever it is, the hope is that he remembers Niebuhr's most famous dictum. It is called the Serenity Prayer and he wrote it in 1943 at a time when he was undergoing great emotional tumult after abandoning pacifism and deciding to support the war. The prayer reads: \"God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference.\" In other words, when all is said and done, when all the pundits are silent, when no one remembers who named what man as his favorite philosopher, the only thing that has the possibility of distinguishing Obama from Bush, will be the exercise of wisdom. Some things never change."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
