In my experience, nothing could be further from the truth. More than five months ago I complained to Barclays regarding the mis-selling of an endowment mortgage in 1990. Barclays upheld the complaint. However, the prolonged process of arriving at a settlement has been a catalogue of disasters. Given the sheer frustration and exasperation of my experience, I ultimately agreed, albeit reluctantly, to their offer. The problem was that although I considered the endowment element of the offer reasonable, I thought the \u00a3200 compensation for the mishandling of the case derisory. They categorically refused to let me settle the two elements separately. When I asked to forgo the \u00a3200 in order to pursue the matter with them directly, I was told that only the total package was on offer. Barclays has made this offer after: \u00b7 Consistently prevaricating and misleading me for five months; \u00b7 Attempting to deny me access to key information necessary to complete their questionnaire; \u00b7 Reneging on a verbal offer, reiterated on three occasions by telephone by one of their officers; \u00b7 Refusing to accept any responsibility for information relayed by their staff, informing me that the member of staff had been 'out of order' and should not have divulged such information; \u00b7 Trying to have a senior manager discuss my endowment details and concerns regarding the above, having lost my file; \u00b7 Dismissing any discussion about obligations to customers in favour of reminders of Barclays' duty to its shareholders; \u00b7 Forcing me to pursue the matter with the Financial Ombudsman Service; \u00b7 Refusing a request by the Financial Ombudsman to honour its most recent offer, rescinding it and then later reinstating it, less \u00a3600; \u00b7 Using subtle, intimidatory and bully-boy tactics to beat me down. So after more than 30 telephone calls, endless written communications and dealing with approximately 12 Barclays staff, keeping a detailed log of the proceedings and finally appealing to the Financial Ombudsman, I have had to settle for an offer lower than that on the table two months ago. It is little wonder that most ordinary customers give up against such odds. Ombudsman's word was final Barclays replies: 'While Barclays took the earliest opportunity to admit liability and agree to compensate Mr Black accordingly, it is regrettable that some genuine errors and misunderstandings have occurred when dealing with this complaint. We fully appreciate the delays encountered in attempting to resolve Mr Black's concerns and can only apologise for the inconvenience caused. In recognition of this matter a further \u00a3200 payment was made to Mr Black above the compensation amount in order to settle the complaint. The correct offer of redress would be to calculate the conversion of the interest-only mortgage to repayment from its inception up to the redemption date in May 2001 and to refund the premiums paid on the endowment from 5 May 2001 until October 2002, with interest. On this basis, the surrender value as at 5 May 2001 would have been \u00a324,766, plus the refund of premiums and interest of \u00a33,078, giving a total of \u00a327,844. Barclays informed Mr Black that this is what we believed the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) would offer. However, an earlier offer of \u00a328,475 had been made, which was calculated on the basis that the interest-only mortgage was still ongoing, rather than redeemed in May 2001. It was decided that we would continue to offer that higher amount of \u00a328,475 to Mr Black on the basis we reached a settlement at that stage (hence the extra \u00a3600). Mr Black was advised that if he should decide to refer the complaint to the FOS, this offer would be withdrawn and Barclays would await their adjudication. Mr Black did refer the matter to the FOS and their adjudication was to settle on \u00a327,844."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
