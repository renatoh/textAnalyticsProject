Well, anyone who's watched Standing in the Shadows of Motown, for starters, the film that looms silently over this documentary about another 60s music scene: the legendary performers and hit records that came swirling like Tennessee River water out of the town of Muscle Shoals, Alabama, pop 8,000. But if it doesn't have quite the same original impact as Standing in the Shadows, and at times looks uncomfortably like a Jack Daniels ad, what Greg Camalier's film shares is a mesmerising soundtrack. Wilson Pickett, Aretha Franklin, Percy \"When a Man Loves a Woman\" Sledge, the Allman Brothers, the Rolling Stones, Jimmy Cliff, Bob Dylan, Etta James: they all came south to the studio built by Rick Hall, an oasis of mixed skin colours and musical styles \u2013 call it hillbilly soul blues \u2013 in cotton-picking, segregationist Alabama. A stubborn charmer whose life was a magnet for tragedy, Hall is the emotional centre not only of the Muscle Shoals sound but of this film. Mick, Keef, Aretha, Pickett, Bono (for some reason), Percy, James, Cliff and that white studio band themselves, the Swampers, are the talking heads. But the true narrator is the music."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
