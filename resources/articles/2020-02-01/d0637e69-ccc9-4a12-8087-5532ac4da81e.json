Neil, whose Andrew Neil Show is aired on BBC Two and who is also a presenter on Politics Live, took to Twitter to complain about a sketch song featured in an archive selection of Horrible Histories favourites put together on CBBC iPlayer and also made available on YouTube to mark Britain\u2019s departure. The offending song, British Things, a popular comic number from 2009 starring Mathew Baynton as a footman and Sarah Hadland as Queen Victoria, shows the monarch being taught where all her \u201cBritish things\u201d really come from, including tea, sugar and cotton. Neil commented: \u201cThis is anti-British drivel of a high order. Was any of the licence fee used to produce something purely designed to demean us?\u201d The satirist Nish Kumar, host of The Mash Report on BBC Two and one of the new hosts of BBC Radio 4\u2019s News Quiz, hosted a selection of Horrible Histories sketches chosen because they featured references to French, Italian and German history. One song made fun of the Italian interest in clothes, while another showed Norman soldiers dancing together in a parody of the Gangnam Style club hit of 2012. Neil\u2019s criticism of the BBC for promoting this content was later picked up by Piers Morgan, who said: \u201cWhy is the BBC paying nasty pieces of work like Kumar to trash Britain like this? An outrageous, shameful abuse of public money.\u201d Kumar, who has previously been attacked by Neil as part of \u201cunfunny\u201d politically-correct BBC satirical output, introduces the Queen Victoria song with a quip about Britain deciding to go it alone after a long and bumpy ride to Brexit. The footage was chosen to promote the online feature. In the song\u2019s most pointed lyric, Baynton\u2019s footman emphasises that these \u201cBritish\u201d goods have come to the Queen\u2019s palace via slave labour. The comedian Emma Kennedy stepped up to defend the song on Twitter, asking: \u201cDrivel? Which bit of it is factually inaccurate?\u201d. Neil replied that he regarded the suggestion that people think tea and sugar are British was a false premise: \u201cThat anybody has ever claimed tea or sugar cane came from Britain. Doh.\u201d The squabble exposes heightened tensions about the tone set by the BBC at a time of political division and follows a week in which the corporation\u2019s future funding via the licence fee has been questioned. The Tory MP Julian Knight was elected as the new chair of parliament\u2019s culture committee and confirmed his intention to examine continuing to pay for the BBC in this way. A BBC spokesperson said: \u201cThe Horrible Histories video is light-hearted and not anti-British. We are a nation, like most others, that enjoys a patchwork of traditions and culture from other countries. Our children\u2019s audience are able to take these things as intended.\u201d Cuts to BBC news services were announced on Wednesday. The Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker, one of the BBC\u2019s most highly paid stars, also suggested last week that the licence fee should become a voluntary payment. On Monday, he told the Guardian: \u201cThe licence fee is our fundamental problem. You\u2019re forced to pay it if you want a TV, and therefore it\u2019s a tax. The public pay our salaries, so everyone is a target. I would make the licence fee voluntary. I\u2019ve always said for a long time, I would make it voluntary. I don\u2019t know the logistics of how it would work. You would lose some people but, at the same time, you\u2019d up the price a bit. It\u2019s the price of a cup of coffee a week at the moment. If you put it up, you could help older people, or those that can\u2019t afford it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
