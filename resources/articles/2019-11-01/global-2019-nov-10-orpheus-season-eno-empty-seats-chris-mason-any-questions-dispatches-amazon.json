The outcome has been decidedly mixed reviews for Offenbach\u2019s Orpheus in the Underworld, Gluck\u2019s Orpheus and Eurydice and Harrison Birtwistle\u2019s The Mask of Orpheus (with Philip Glass\u2019s Orph\u00e9e still to come), and hardly a mad rush to book seats \u2013 there have been plenty of available tickets for most nights. The very young and the over-60s can buy half-price seats on the day of the performance, provided they go to the Coliseum in person. A real bargain, considering full whack for the stalls, and most of the dress circle, is between \u00a3100 and \u00a3125. And for a couple of recent performances, some lucky people who had purchased seats in the balcony were brought down to the upper circle to \u201cfill the place up\u201d. The ENO counters that it has reached 78% of its targets in terms of both bums on seats and revenue thus far for the Orpheus season, though it will not divulge what those target figures were. It is proud, too, of its new Response programme, where a handful of wannabe critics, who are mentored, have penned their own reviews. The sceptics might say that this is a riposte to the sometimes prickly \u201cmainstream media\u201d, though the scheme was announced before the Orpheus season opened. I\u2019ve had a look, and they are, well, fairly generous notices. Anyway, I\u2019m really looking forward to Orph\u00e9e, which opens on 15 November, because I love the mesmeric 1950 Jean Cocteau film, and Glass is my favourite living composer. So far, so good for Chris Mason, who took over last month as the new chair of Radio 4\u2019s Any Questions, succeeding Jonathan Dimbleby. I\u2019d known Mason only on the TV, as one of the BBC\u2019s legion of political hacks, with his nerdy-looking specs and Yorkshire-toned blokiness. So he was a surprise choice, given that one of the summer stand-in presenters \u2013 Ritula Shah, Julian Worricker or Shaun Ley \u2013 was expected to get the nod. Mason is now confounding any naysayers with his easy manner and fair-minded control of the panel and audience. It just shows how some news broadcasters are better suited to radio than TV. Witness Evan Davis, who has come into his own on Radio 4\u2019s PM after seeming ill at ease on Newsnight. One in three of all online purchases now come through Amazon. Tomorrow, Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches puts the mega giant under the spotlight, looking at its control over shopping and some of its potentially dangerous products. Interesting, then, that over the past month, ads from Amazon have run on Channel 4 featuring employees saying how much they love working in its warehouses. Surely a PR counter to the many reports highlighting its pay and conditions. Amazon is also offering public tours in eight of its British warehouses, which they charmingly call \u201cfulfilment centres\u201d. Must go on one, if only to make a change from those National Trust traipses... Richard Brooks is an arts journalist and columnist for the Observer New Review"}, "isHosted": false}}}
