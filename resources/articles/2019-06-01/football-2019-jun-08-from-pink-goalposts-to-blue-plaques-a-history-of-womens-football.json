It was amazing. \u201cWe\u2019d gone from playing on park pitches and suddenly we were running out in front of 80,000 people inside huge stadiums and being invited to a cocktail party at the British Embassy. It was an unknown world. We didn\u2019t realise it at the time but it was a moment in history.\u201d Lockwood was part of a band of pioneers who, during an era when the Football Association barred women from playing a game they deemed \u201cquite unsuitable for females\u201d, represented a rebel England side which in 1971 participated in an unofficial World Cup in Mexico. She and her teammates helped rekindle interest in a sport which burgeoned in Britain after the first world war but, in 1921, was banned for 50 years by the FA. Phil Neville\u2019s fully professional England squad would do well to spare a thought for Lockwood, her fellow trailblazers and the man who made it all possible. The late Harry Batt, manager of both that convention-challenging, prejudice-defying, 1971 team and Chiltern Valley Ladies, was a visionary. A prophet in the wilderness, Batt battled \u2013 often forlornly \u2013 to persuade the FA to open their eyes to the immense potential of women\u2019s football. Although the ruling body did lift the ban three months after his rebels returned from Mexico City, it was done in a slightly grudging manner, with women allowed to play at FA-affiliated grounds but advised, albeit tacitly, to \u201cstay in your lane\u201d. Batt continued to be largely ostracised by Lancaster Gate\u2019s top brass. He was met with a complete lack of interest, says Jean Williams, professor of sport at Wolverhampton University, as well as \u201coutright chauvinism.\u201d Yet in Mexico City, in August 1971, his 14-strong squad were treated like royalty from the moment they walked through passport control into a brave new world of flashing cameras and cheering crowds. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter to the Mexicans that we were female, it was football,\u201d says Lockwood. \u201cBut it was thanks to Harry and his wife June, who helped run the team, that we were there. Harry had a big vision for women\u2019s football; we hope that now he\u2019ll finally be recognised.\u201d It was 20 years before Fifa staged the first official Women\u2019s World Cup but their commercial department was made to look several yards off the pace by Martini &amp; Rossi, sponsors of Mexico \u201971, who funded travel and accommodation for the six participating teams. A year earlier, the drinks company had also facilitated the first unofficial women\u2019s World Cup in Italy but 1971 elevated the game to a whole new level, with 110,000 watching Denmark beat Mexico 3-0 in the final. By way of heightening marketing appeal to a female audience, the goal frames were painted in pink and white hoops, all stadium staff wore pink outfits and pop-up hair and beauty salons appeared outside the Azteca Stadium. \u201cMexico \u201971 was a success because the organisers planned it very well and were very financially shrewd,\u201d says Williams. \u201cThey never assumed it would be a commercial or sporting failure. It was sold and promoted as a proper football tournament that just happened to feature females.\u201d Indeed it was such a hit that Williams discovered the media coverage extended to a Mexican soft porn magazine. \u201cThe match reports were the only non-smutty thing in it,\u201d she says. England lost their three games but, considering they were unable to play on proper pitches at home and their squad contained three teenagers in Lockwood, then 15, Gill Sayell, 14, and Leah Caleb, 13, Batt\u2019s side departed with heads held high. \u201cThe games were extremely physical,\u201d recalls Caleb. \u201cThe one against Argentina was brutal \u2013 two players ended up in plaster casts.\u201d Not that anyone in England seemed remotely interested. The three teenagers simply returned to school and immediate anonymity. \u201cIn Mexico we\u2019d been on television, had police escorts, done interviews, signed autographs and been welcomed by the British Embassy, but nothing was said at school,\u201d says Lockwood. \u201cNo teacher ever mentioned it. It was as if it had never happened. There was nothing \u2013 and no one \u2013 to give us a voice, so we kept our story to ourselves.\u201d It would be another 15 years before Fifa embraced the women\u2019s game and that came only after a hefty nudge from the Norwegians back in Mexico City \u2013 evidently the early de facto capital of women\u2019s football. Perhaps it had something to do with the rarefied, high altitude, air but, at the 1986 Fifa congress, the delegation from Oslo succeeded in persuading the international ruling body to take \u201cthe fillies\u201d fully under its wing. Seven years later the FA finally followed suit. An awful lot of water had passed under the bridge since 1628 and the first recorded match involving women in Europe. Documents from south Lanarkshire dating back almost 400 years detail a Scottish church minister\u2019s outraged condemnation of the men and women spied playing mixed football across Carstairs village green on the sabbath. France 2019 may be Scotland\u2019s first World Cup but, like Mexico, the country provided a significant staging post in the world\u2019s game\u2019s history. Edinburgh quite possibly witnessed the birth of international fixtures when, late in the 19th century, a team of English women crossed Hadrian\u2019s Wall to face a home side led by Helen Graham Matthews. A riot erupted among 5,000 extremely excited spectators and, shortly afterwards, women\u2019s football was outlawed across Scotland. Graham Matthews simply decamped to London where she joined forces with Nettie Honeyball in establishing the British Ladies\u2019 Football Club in 1895. Their first fixture, at the Crouch End Athletic Ground in Hornsey, north London, attracted a 12,000-strong crowd and stemmed from a newspaper advert placed by Honeyball \u2013 a pseudonym \u2013 seeking players. Thirty, mainly middle-class women responded with the sympathies of most resting firmly with the suffragette movement. Women\u2019s football has often developed along parallel lines to feminism, its periods of rapid growth invariably coinciding with waves of wider emancipation. Tellingly, Honeyball was anxious to demonstrate that, liberated from their uncomfortable and oppressively restrictive Victorian clothing, women could be athletic and physically capable. Honeyball found a soulmate in Lady Florence Dixie. A Scottish war correspondent, explorer and feminist, Lady Florence variously reported on South Africa\u2019s Boer and Anglo Zulu wars, traversed Patagonia and became president of the British Ladies. She died of diphtheria before the first world war opened the game to a much broader, more working-class constituency. With so many men suddenly spirited away to fight on foreign fields, women staffed farms and factories and it was not long before many enjoyed regular lunchtime kickabouts. Soon they were playing organised matches with spectators\u2019 admission money funnelled to the charities which fulfilled the societal functions later performed by the NHS and the welfare state. \u201cWomen who had previously been in service worked outside the home for the first time,\u201d says Williams. \u201cIt was a huge change.\u201d Perhaps the most celebrated factory team was Dick, Kerr\u2019s Ladies in Preston, which raised a collective sum equivalent to millions of pounds in today\u2019s money, but the game also blossomed among those employed by munitions factories, particularly in Northumberland and Durham. In 2018 a blue plaque was finally installed at Croft Park, home of Blyth Spartans, in honour of Bella Reay who scored 133 goals in a single season as the club\u2019s Ladies won the Munitionettes\u2019 Cup. Little did she know it but Reay was playing in an era which laid the foundations of female football\u2019s eventual globalisation and has turned some of her north-east-born successors, most notably Lucy Bronze, Steph Houghton and Jill Scott \u2013 very much the nucleus of Neville\u2019s England \u2013 into international stars. Accordingly the war\u2019s end prefaced the advent of European competition and, in 1920, a French team managed by a leading feminist named Alice Milliat crossed the channel for a tour which kicked off with the players arriving in Preston to be serenaded by a brass band and streets lined by thousands of cheering fans. Boxing Day 1920 suggested that women\u2019s football was more popular than the men\u2019s version when Dick, Kerr\u2019s Ladies v St Helens Ladies at Goodison Park attracted 53,000 supporters with a further 15,000 turned away. The famous Lyons coffee houses supported a number of teams, frequently decorating their cake boxes with pictures of women kicking balls. A 21st century equivalent would involve images of Houghton or Bronze adorning Starbucks or Costa merchandise. In 1921 the FA took fright and, after consulting \u201cmedical experts\u201d, made the reactionary decision to bar women from playing on all affiliated grounds. For several decades the female game virtually disappeared from public view \u2013 and not only in England. France banned it in 1932, West Germany in 1955, Norway in 1931 and Brazil from 1941. They were not alone. As an era of socially conservative rightwing dictatorships assumed power across South America, a sport the continent\u2019s historians had noted women first playing in the early 1900s entered hibernation became an isolated, almost underground, movement. West Germany\u2019s DFB depicted their ban as a defence of femininity. \u201cThis aggressive sport is essentially alien to the nature of woman,\u201d it decreed in 1955. \u201cIn the fight for the ball, the feminine grace vanishes, body and soul will inevitably suffer harm \u2026 The display of the woman\u2019s body offends decency and modesty.\u201d An Englishman named Percy Ashley was among those infuriated by such blatant sexism. In 1949 he enabled his football-mad daughter, Doris, to play by founding Manchester Corinthians, a side comprised mainly of typists and machinists. The Corinthians became so quietly successful that the Red Cross flew them to South America for a series of fundraising matches. Subsequent tours of Europe and North Africa helped raise a collective \u00a3275,000 for the charity and, in 1957, they won an unofficial tournament in Germany with Bert Trautmann, of Manchester City goalkeeping fame, acting as interpreter. Yet without a national framework and institutionalised support, teams like the Corinthians represented rare oases in a footballing desert. The importance of state endorsement was highlighted in the United States in 1972. No matter that North American women were late to the party and did not begin kicking balls in earnest until the 70s; a piece of federal legislation known as Title IX would not merely serve as a catalyst for radical change but alter an entire nation\u2019s sporting topography. Title IX is the reason the US remain the foremost power in women\u2019s football and head to France as World Cup holders. In enforcing gender equality in high school and college education, both academic and sporting, it created a legal imperative that female athletes be afforded equal rights to federal financial assistance. Fast-forward to a sweltering Californian afternoon in 1999 as, with a single swipe of her supposedly weak left foot, Brandi Chastain converted the final penalty of the tensest of shootouts against China to win the World Cup for the US. As she celebrated by whipping off her shirt to reveal a black sports bra, the 90,185 crowd inside Pasadena\u2019s Rose Bowl swayed to Jennifer Lopez\u2019s Let\u2019s Get Loud. Admittedly Chastain\u2019s iconic cameo would eventually be seen as a starting gun for evolution rather than revolution but, temporarily at least, the planet woke up to the potential of women\u2019s football. A defender with two reconstructed knees dubbed \u201cHollywood\u201d by teammates in homage to her love of big occasions and bright lights, Chastain tricked China\u2019s goalkeeper by deciding against taking the kick with her preferred right foot. \u201cAs I walked up I thought: \u2018Don\u2019t look at the keeper,\u2019\u201d Chastian recalls. \u201cWhen I hit it everything went into slow motion, it was like being in a car accident. It was life affirming.\u201d Eight years earlier the first official World Cup \u2013 well sort of \u2013 had taken place in China. Fifa\u2019s concerns about its brand somehow being tainted by female involvement provoked a compromise whereby the word \u201cCup\u201d was dropped from a tournament sponsored by Mars and named The First Fifa World Championship for Women\u2019s Football. Games lasted only 80 minutes. \u201cFifa was afraid our ovaries were going to fall out,\u201d deadpanned the then-US captain April Heinrichs in Gemma Clarke\u2019s excellent book Soccerwomen. Women\u2019s football had been banned in China until 1970 and the tournament was televised merely on domestic channels but, contrary to expectations, grounds were packed. Almost 65,000 filled the Guangdong Stadium to see Michelle Akers score twice as the US beat Norway 2-1 in the final. Considering the Americans suffered debilitating stomach upsets and arrived clutching toilet rolls to equip them for Guangdong\u2019s hole-in-the-ground lavatories it was quite an achievement. Other countries started taking note. Denmark, Italy, Norway and Sweden were initially the most enlightened but Germany swiftly caught up. A side propelled by the free-scoring, three-times world footballer of the year Birgit Prinz proceeded to five straight European Championships in addition to the 2003 and 2007 World Cups. After Prinz\u2019s retirement, they defended the Euros in 2013. Germany had aimed for a World Cup hat-trick in 2011, staged on home soil, but a star was rising in the east and the hosts were knocked out by the Nadeshiko in the quarter-finals. A Japan side starring midfielder Homare Sawa beat the US in the final, with those positions reversed at Canada 2015. It was a far cry from 1980 when Japan staged its first women\u2019s tournament. Played eight-a-side on mini pitches using children\u2019s footballs, halves lasted 25 minutes and handballs were permissible if they protected players\u2019 breasts. Change was eventually driven by business behemoths. During the late 1980s, at the height of Japan\u2019s economic boom, leading companies including Nissan began sponsoring teams in a new semi-professional league. Players were allocated office jobs allowing ample time off for training regimes big on technical skills. As the years passed, exceptional women footballers around the world such as Brazil\u2019s Marta \u2013 dubbed \u201cPel\u00e9 in a skirt\u201d \u2013 challenged accepted narratives about patriarchal cultures and male and female behavioural conventions. Yet as Lockwood prepares to cheer the Lionesses on in France she reflects on a wasted opportunity. \u201cMexico \u201971 was the stepping stone for women\u2019s football to move forward but the FA missed a big chance,\u201d she reflects. \u201cI feel sorry for the girls who came after us and didn\u2019t get the same opportunities but I\u2019m so pleased, so thrilled, to see today\u2019s England players finally getting everything they deserve. I\u2019ll be over the moon if they win the World Cup.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
