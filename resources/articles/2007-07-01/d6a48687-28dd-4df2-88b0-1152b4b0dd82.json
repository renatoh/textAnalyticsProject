But who can deny the central place of a takeaway meal that has survived wartime rationing, defied every change in taste for two centuries and held off the tasty challenge of Indian, Chinese and Thai rivals? It is a nourishing combination - and healthy in moderation. The church's old requirement of fish on Fridays was less theology than Jamie Oliver or the Food Standards Agency in medieval guise. But the greatest attraction has always been the extremely reasonable price; and that is now under threat. Fish stocks are vulnerable and this year's so-called summer has played havoc with crops of potatoes and made prematurely mushy peas. The country's 10,500 chippies have offered exceptional value for such a long time. That matters, especially in those areas where the meal is the only cheap and cheerful way to eat out, and the process of buying it a social ritual as strong as going to the pub. But a generally more prosperous country can afford to pay more, and will. The greater test is the need to safeguard cod and haddock and accept less familiar fish inside the batter sleeve. Huss and chips, anyone? How about skate, some mahi-mahi, next to those mushy peas? For a nation which once believed only in beef and beer, it's a modest enough challenge. Maybe, as we get used to the new tastes, even a treat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
