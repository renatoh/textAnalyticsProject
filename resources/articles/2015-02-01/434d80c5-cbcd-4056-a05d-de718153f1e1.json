What happens now is largely up to Stuart Lancaster but the fly-half has pledged to do all he possibly can to remain a part of England\u2019s plans. Cipriani already knew what he was missing, having made a return to Test rugby off the bench in New Zealand last summer, but scoring with only his second touch of the ball on Saturday has further heightened his desire to extend his international resurrection. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I want to be out of this England side ever again, for as long as I\u2019m playing,\u201d he says softly, visibly determined to make up for lost time. No one knows better than Cipriani that the selectorial odds are still piled up against him. Owen Farrell will be fit before the end of the season and it seems unlikely England will have room for more than two specialist fly-halves in their 31-man World Cup squad. All he can do is grasp whatever scraps materialise as Ford\u2019s understudy and keep displaying the application which has increasingly impressed his coaches at Sale. As far as Cipriani is concerned, however, a degree of fate is increasingly involved. He has revealed on Twitter he dedicated his try to his late uncle who, just before he passed away in November, predicted his nephew would score on his international comeback. \u201cI was with him in his last hour talking about everything and he said it would just be my luck to play and score in my first opportunity.\u201d Posting a picture of himself in mid-air over the Italian line he also described the sensation of scoring for England as \u201cthe best feeling in the world \u2013 things in life shape us, refocus us.\u201d By his own admission Cipriani is also a wiser man than he was in the distant days of 2008. While he gave one of the great fly-half displays against Ireland at Twickenham that year, injury and off-field distractions led to a decision to relocate to Australia which did nothing for his international prospects. A rather better move has been his link-up with Steve Black, Jonny Wilkinson\u2019s former mentor, which has sharpened his focus and restored his appetite to make the most of his natural talent. These days Cipriani also keeps a journal, detailing his personal goals and emotions, and comes across as a far more dedicated athlete. \u201cYou grow up and gaps in your life get filled, whatever they may be. I just feel like I\u2019m in a much wiser position and more stable in that way. Previously I probably took it all for granted a little bit \u2026 you don\u2019t really appreciate the moments as they come along. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing now. I\u2019m very focused on making the best of my ability \u2026 I\u2019m only 27, so I\u2019m still a good three or four years off my peak.\u201d Ford is going to be extremely hard to shift and Cipriani knows his best chance of staying involved is to concentrate on being a good team man first and foremost. \u201cIt\u2019s all about moving forward as a squad, it\u2019s not about the individual. I am not going to wish anyone to slip up. At some point maybe the opportunity may come. Everyone is aiming to get to that No1 spot, whatever position it is.\u201d \u201cBut if my chance comes in 20- minute spells, I need to do what is right for the team to win the game,\u201d he added. \u201cWhatever it might be I have to do it because right now we have got a special team building.\u201d Whatever else the fates have in store for him, Cipriani will never forget his Twickenham re-entry, not least the roar from the stands when he came on. \u201cYou try not to take note of the background but I was very humbled by the reaction I got from the crowd. Inside I am very excited to be here and to have scored the try. But in my head the job is not done. There is still a lot for me to work on.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
