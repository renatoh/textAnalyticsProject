The 20 cottages are built up on stilts, thatched with straw, and powered with solar energy. It's a surprisingly comfortable place to stay (even if occasionally shared with fellow \"guests\" from the jungle), but the cosiness is always accompanied by a sense of genuine adventure.

Rather than cool and impersonal, his work is tailored to the individual personality of a house. So too with what was formerly Hotel do Praca in Trancoso, which Bergamin transformed into the Quadrado in 2001. You can relax on beds made in white and red, or on cheerfully striped cushions. The easy-going style of Bahia is also in evidence in the restaurant. Chef Leticia Pimenta may have cooked in restaurants around the world, but her menus always have a local touch.

Hotel Antumalal, Araucan\u00eda, Chile In October 1938 Guillermo and Catalina Pollak, a young couple from Prague fleeing the impending second world war, arrived in Pucon with dreams of making a new life for themselves in Chile. At first, their chosen home on the other side of the world proved full of obstacles. A volcanic eruption and a fire destroyed the Pollakstet club and hotel. Ten years later, however, things were at last on the up - literally so. High on a rocky plateau above Lake Villarrica, the couple created - together with Chilean architect Jorge Elton - one of the most unusual hotels in South America: a long, flat building in the Bauhaus style. Antumalal commands views across a garden of flowers, far across the water to the volcano with its snow-capped summit.

La Pascuala Delta Lodge, Province Buenos Aires, Argentina Just a few miles out of Buenos Aires you come to the Parana delta, a landscape of small waterways and lush vegetation where life seems to move in slow motion. It's the perfect place to while away the days paddling a kayak, watching the birds or fishing from the riverbank. La Pascuala Delta Lodge is on the bank of the Arroyo Las Canas, surrounded by unspoilt marshlands. A few stray buildings are supported on stilts and connected by wooden walkways or bridges. The 15 bungalow suites are like private homes - for a few happy days, you are the owner of a humble lodging of understated luxury with a dream veranda and views of the greenery. c/o Montevideo 1938, C1021AAH, Buenos Aires (00 54 11 4728 1253/1395, lapascuala.com) Book to pack: Mascaro, The American Hunter by Haroldo Conti.

La Posada del Faro, Maldonado, Uruguay East of Montevideo and the vacation capital of Uruguay, Punta del Este, lies the peaceful town of Maldonado, with its white sandy beaches lapped by the waves of the Atlantic. The perfect retreat for a summer vacation, well away from the crowds, is the Posada del Faro, with its gleaming white walls, awnings and sun umbrellas. It's just 30m from the ocean. The pool is pure blue, and so (most days) is the sky; and if that's not enough blue for you, there are blue-painted doors and blue carpets. Otherwise, the 10 rooms are cream-coloured, with a good deal of wood; all have their own secluded terrace with recliners or hammocks. In the evenings when the barbecue is fired up for the typical asado and diners take their places at long tables, it's like eating with friends. The Posada del Faro is an excellent base for local excursions - to bathing resorts such as Punta del Este or La Paloma, to the Isla de Lobos with its colony of sea lions, or to Cerro Catedral, which at 513m is Uruguay's highest peak.

I've never understood activity holidays since we seem to have far too much activity in our daily lives as it is. Find a culture where loafing is the order of the day and where they don't understand our need to be constantly doing things. Find somewhere you can have a hammock holiday. My most recent experience of such a place is Mexico. I went on a trip there to Zihuatanejo in the south-west earlier in the year and the first thing that struck me was the sheer quantity of hammocks. Mexicans love hammocks; hammocks are a priority. Even the humblest tumbledown shack has a hammock strung up outside it. The house where we stayed had two hammocks, one in the sun and one in the shade. It takes a while to master the art of hammock-lounging. At first I could only manage five minutes or so before I thought I ought to get out and go and help a child learn how to swim or something. But after observing the Mexicans' capability for staring into space for hours on end, I decided to put in some proper practice. Soon I was able to lie there for longer stretches without feeling the need to do something useful. My finest moment was when my two-year-old daughter fell asleep on top of me while I lounged. I stayed awake and immobile, staring at the sky and the passing pelicans, for nearly two hours. Towards the end of the holiday I had succeeded in achieving two-nap days. I came home feeling very pleased with myself, and put a hammock up in our garden. It's now in the shed because it rains all the time, but you can dream. \u00b7 Tom Hodgkinson is editor of the Idler and author of How To Be Idle published by Hamish Hamilton at \u00a312.99."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
