This is unreconstructed geezer rock, booze and brawn marinated in the decades-old sweat of Slade and the Faces, and, as such, is pretty much critic-proof. But albums this single-minded really shouldn't hang around for over 50 minutes; before the party's even over, the hangover has kicked in. Like Alex Turner with a head injury, Jon Fratelli writes observational lyrics that observe nothing, and character songs with no character: witness the shameless codswallop of Mistress Mabel. There's a flash of wit on Jesus Stole My Baby (\"so maybe I should steal his\"), but a lyric from Look Out Sunshine! sums up the Fratellis' wilfully limited horizons: \"I'm a cynical cunt and I'm much too lazy to change.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
