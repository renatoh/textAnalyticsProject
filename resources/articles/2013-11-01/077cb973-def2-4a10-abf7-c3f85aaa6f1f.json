Duncan Taylor, the Saracen who makes his first start in the centre is, it seems, the fourth Taylor, but only the second back to be selected, while the combined height of the two Grays \u2013 13ft 4in \u2013 clearly makes them the tallest of the 46 pairs to have gone before. All very interesting if you are that way inclined. However, a quick look down the teamsheet for Sunday's Test \u2013 the 17th played between the sides in Edinburgh \u2013 shows perhaps a more relevant statistic; of the 126 caps shared between the five backs, 80 of them belong to one man, the wing Sean Lamont. \"I think I was worse last week,\" said Lamont looking back to Saturday's victory over Japan. \"I think there were 188 caps [throughout the side] and 80 of them belonged to me. Eighty that's a land mark \u2026 80 and counting.\" The last bit is important because Lamont, already Scotland's most-capped three quarter by a country mile, intends going on \u2013 to the World Cup at least and possibly beyond. \"I'll keep on at my rugby for as long as possible then get into conditioning or something,\" says Lamont. \"I feel stronger and as fast and as fit as I've ever been.\" The wing from Perth believes that part of that feelgood factor is down to the decision he took at the start of last season when he left the Scarlets in Llanelli and returned to play with Glasgow, a move, he admits, intended to prolong his Test career as well as reuniting him with his younger rugby-playing brother, Rory. In part it worked; Lamont has been a regular on the Scotland teamsheet ever since. In fact, apart from eight months at the end 2008, Lamont senior has been relatively injury-free, benefiting massively from the weeks off guaranteed to Scotland's Test players playing at home. \"I came back because Rory was there, but also for the player management and the international side of things it was a good move,\" he says, explaining why he had decided against a more lucrative move, possibly a stint in England or possibly France, where Rory had been playing. \"In England, if you're not in the English side, then you won't get rested as much,\" says Lamont, and while he admired the even-handedness of Nigel Davies, then coaching the Scarlets, it was the guaranteed game off every six weeks that proved the big attraction. \"That might seem to take away from some of the games, but from a player point of view you keep fresh, you are not ground into the ground, worn out. You get those little pick-me-ups and it definitely allows your to perform better throughout the season and in the long run it prolongs your career.\" Not for Rory, however. The reunion was shortlived and Rory (formerly with Sale and Toulon, with 29 Scotland caps) and Sean (Rotherham and Northampton as well as the Scarlets) were separated again, this time by injury. \"He was plagued by them; I think he took my share as well,\" says Sean, at 32 the elder by 21 months. However, while Rory does a bit of TV work and ponders a world after rugby, Sean is thinking about life under a new Scotland coach, Vern Cotter, who takes over next summer once he has completed his contract with Clermont Auvergne. Cotter, Lamont's fifth Scotland coach since making his debut under Matt Williams in the summer of 2004, was over last week, getting the measure of his new side alongside the interim head coach, Scott Johnson. \"He came over to have a look around,\" says Lamont. \"He showed his face and introduced himself which is fair enough. I hadn't actually spoken to him until last week.\" However, when Cotter begins Scotland will be well into the final stages of their World Cup preparations. What that means for Lamont is unclear, although he is more than happy to be judged on form. \"Age is not a good excuse not to pick someone,\" he says. \"But it's whatever the coach wants and with Vern coming in next summer it'll be his choice. I'm content to be judged on my Glasgow form,\" says Lamont, but it would be a shortsighted coach who overlooked experience and Lamont has plenty, Sunday being his fifth tilt against the team ranked second in the world (and who Scotland will face in the World Cup group stages). He has also won one, being part of the side which ground out victory at Murrayfield three seasons ago, and last summer came close to a second in Nelspruit when a familiar French face had a hand in Scotland's destiny. Leading after an hour, the match changed when Romain Poite sent the lock Jim Hamilton to the sin bin for a brush-off which the referee later conceded did not warrant a yellow. \"Annoyingly, it was a very mild thing,\" says Lamont. \"And it was actually the South African video ref who said Jim deserved a yellow.\" More annoyingly, this was the second time M Poite has apologised to Scotland, the first after disallowing a try against Wales a year ago. On Sunday Lamont hopes for better from another French referee, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Garc\u00e8s. It would go some way to repairing the damage caused by his fellow countryman as well as repaying Lamont's obvious efforts on the training ground. \"The older you get the harder you have to work,\" says Lamont before heading back for a second session on Murrayfield's back pitches. \"Compared to the young guys I have to put in the extra yard.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
