BAT's chairman, Jan du Plessis, said: \"Our willingness to consider closing Southampton, which has been in operation for more than eight decades and which really is part of BAT's heartland, shows management's determination to address costs aggressively.\" The plant closure is expected to generate \u00a340m in savings and will cost \u00a3160m. The chief executive, Paul Adams, said there were other factories in western Europe operating at low levels of capacity, similar to those at the Southampton plant. BAT is officially reviewing production at all 65 of its factories in 58 countries but capacity levels at 16 sites in western Europe are thought to be the focus of scrutiny. The world's second-largest cigarette manufacturer this year raised its target for overhead cost savings by 60%, to \u00a3320m - to be achieved by 2007. Analysts expect more cuts from manufacturing and distribution operations to generate further savings. Mr Adams insisted BAT was not just a cost-cutting company. \"Organic growth is the way to bet for the foreseeable future. It is a measure of our competitive strength and vitality in the market place.\" BAT yesterday posted a 2% growth in worldwide sales volumes from continuing operations for the first six months of 2005, against a market thought to be shrinking by about 0.5% a year. The volumes of the group's four leading international brands - Kent, Pall Mall, Dunhill and Lucky Strike - grew by 6%. Mr Adams conceded: \"This is slightly behind where we would like to be.\" He said he was \"pretty confident\" volume sales for the main four brands would move towards the group's long-term target of about 8% for the full-year. Total volume growth is likely to drop to between 1.5% and 2%. Among countries showing strong volume growth were Turkey, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, Romania and Bangladesh. Tougher markets included Canada, South Korea, Italy and Malaysia. Earnings per share were up 23% for the half-year but the finance director, Paul Rayner, cautioned that the figure had been distorted by new international accounting treatments. BAT's underlying pre-tax profit on continuing business was up 8% at \u00a31.25bn. Shares in BAT closed up 23p at \u00a310.96."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
