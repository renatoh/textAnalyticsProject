The Getaway 11.25pm, TCM (Sam Peckinpah, 1972) Steve McQueen's Doc, just out of jail, teams up with wife Ali MacGraw to recover the loot, pursued by cops, the mob and sadistic hitman Al Lettieri: can he blast his way to safety in Peckinpah's redemptive Mexico? Moving through a sunbaked landscape McQueen is all icy poise, the gunfights are stunning, the whole thing lean and hard as Jim Thompson's novel. Sunflower 1.20am, Film4 (Zhang Yang, 2005) Zhang's drama focuses on an awkward father-son relationship, but is as much about 30 years of socio-political change in China. It's a poignant tale, with Haiying Sun as the curmudgeonly painter who emerges from a labour camp to insist on realising his ambitions vicariously through his son (who is played at different ages by three actors). It's photographed by Jong Lin, a former collaborator of Ang Lee."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
