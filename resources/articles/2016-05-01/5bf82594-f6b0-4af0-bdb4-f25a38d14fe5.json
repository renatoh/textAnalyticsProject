The regulator said on its website on Monday evening the company would be given an opportunity to revise its plans and resubmit. The decision implies the regulator found BP\u2019s plans did not meet its regulatory requirements, although the reasons were kept secret. The company has already been given another chance to revise its plans and resubmit when Nopsema came to the same decision in November 2015. \u201cNopsema will typically provide two opportunities to modify and resubmit, but is not restricted to providing only two opportunities,\u201d the regulator said in its announcement. The application process has been criticised in a recent Senate inquiry as secretive and weak, since most of the process is not made public, where it could be scrutinised. The bight, off Australia\u2019s southern coastline, is a haven for whales, sea lions and other marine life. It supports a large fishing industry and much of it is covered by nature reserves. It is unclear what sort of modelling BP has conducted of an oil leak in the bight, which is a major concern to conservationists since BP was responsible for the world\u2019s biggest oil leak \u2013 the Deepwater Horizon spill of 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico \u2013 which occurred in calmer and more shallow waters than those in the bight. Just last week, Shell caused a large leak in the same waters. But modelling of a leak commissioned by the Wilderness Society suggested it would affect most of the southern coast of Australia, with the worst-affected areas depending on the season. \u201cBP should just give up and ditch its plans for the bight before it wastes any more of its shareholders\u2019 money on an investment that the world can\u2019t use and will become a stranded asset,\u201d said the Wilderness Society national director, Lyndon Schneiders. The director of Wilderness Society South Australia, Peter Owen, said: \u201cOne would expect BP to go to great lengths to show the regulator it had learned from the Gulf of Mexico disaster and submit an application that would far exceed the required standards. Instead it again submitted a substandard application in the hope it will be approved.\u201d The Greens senator for South Australia, Robert Simms, who established a senate inquiry into BP\u2019s plans with independent Senator Nick Xenophon, also called on BP to give up on its plans. \u201cIt\u2019s clear BP aren\u2019t respecting the precious Great Australian Bight environment as once again Nopsema determine that BP\u2019s shoddy environmental plan requires modifications,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot risk a catastrophic oil spill in the Bight, a pristine environment which is home to endangered and threatened species like the southern wright whale and Australian sea lion. Any major spill would also decimate our coastal tourism and fishing industries which contribute 9,000 sustainable jobs and almost $1.5bn to the South Australian economy,\u201d Simms said. Sea Shepherd Australia\u2019s managing director, Jeff Hansen, said in a statement: \u201cThe whales of the Great Australian Bight can breathe a slight sigh of relief today. \u201cSix years on, BP has still not cleaned up its catastrophic spill in the Gulf of Mexico, with mothers still giving birth to stillborn dolphin calves,\u201d he said. \u201cIf BP is allowed to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight, it\u2019s not a question of if there will be an oil spill but when, and the Great Australian Bight is not worth the risk.\u201d A spokeswoman for BP said although the decision meant BP\u2019s application didn\u2019t meet Nopsema\u2019s regulatory requirements for approval, it wasn\u2019t a rejection. \u201cNopsema has provided BP with a further \u2018opportunity to modify and resubmit\u2019 its environment plan, which is not a rejection but another step in the normal, iterative process with this regulator,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have allowed sufficient time in our programme schedule for this regulatory process and continue to work toward commencing exploration drilling in late 2016, subject to the acceptance of our environment plan.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
