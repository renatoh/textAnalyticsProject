George Brandis made the comments on ABC\u2019s AM program on Friday in response to claims the government had not consulted sufficiently on the terms of reference for the inquiry. He also defended the participation of the Northern Territory government and the appointment of a former Northern Territory chief justice, Brian Ross Martin, to head the commission. The royal commission, announced on Thursday, will consider the Don Dale facility and Northern Territory juvenile detention system but will not extend to other states and territories. Labor\u2019s leader in the Senate, Penny Wong, has criticised the lack of consultation and asked why an Indigenous commissioner was not appointed as well as Martin. Brandis said he had consulted the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice commissioner, Mick Gooda, and the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, had consulted his Indigenous advisory council chairman, Warren Mundine. Brandis said his office had also been approached by Indigenous justice organisations. Brandis said \u201cwe wanted to act swiftly and decisively\u201d. \u201cAnd, frankly, I\u2019m more interested in the royal commission getting to the bottom of the problem and coming up with actionable answers to the identified problems than having a debate about process,\u201d he said. The terms of reference were \u201ccomprehensive but focused\u201d. \u201cThe fact we didn\u2019t hold some endless public seminar with any number of groups to talk about what should have been in the terms of reference is hardly the point,\u201d he said. Brandis defended consulting the Northern Territory\u2019s chief minister, Adam Giles, saying Giles was \u201cthe first one to say there should be a royal commission\u201d. \u201cThis is a chief minister saying there should be a royal commission into his own government and former Labor governments,\u201d he said. Giles was cooperative and had, in fact, broadened the terms of reference. Brandis said state governments often set up royal commissions to investigate abuses in their jurisdiction. Asked about the appointment of Martin, Brandis said the NT government had not suggested him and \u201cjust because he may have sentenced juveniles does not mean he is not independent\u201d. \u201cAny suggestion that he is not independent, not suitable for a task of this kind, is very foolish,\u201d he said. Speaking on Radio National on Friday, Wong said: \u201cThere appears to have been very little consultation with the community. That is regrettable. That is disappointing. \u201cNot only were the opposition not consulted, it appears many experts and advocates and communities in the Northern Territory have not been consulted.\u201d AM\u2019s host, Ellen Fanning, said Gooda told Radio National on Thursday that he had contacted Brandis, not the other way around, and Brandis had called back, said he would \u201cthink about consultation\u201d but did not call back again. Wong said this showed Brandis had been \u201cfar too slippery\u201d. Wong said the \u201cfirst order of priority is to deal with the territory\u201d. There should then be an opportunity to extend the scope of the inquiry if that was required because incarceration of Indigenous people was a national issue, she said. The Australian Human Rights Commission president, Gillian Triggs, has recommended a two-phase inquiry to look first at the Northern Territory and then juvenile detention nationally. Wong said the federal government should have considered appointing additional commissioners because the inquiry would \u201cprobably benefit\u201d from an Indigenous commissioner. At a press conference on Friday, the acting opposition leader, Tanya Plibersek, said the government should pause and \u201creconsider the rushed job they\u2019ve done on the terms of reference\u201d. She said when she spoke to Turnbull on Thursday he had said \u201cit was possible to amend the terms of reference during the course of the royal commission should that become necessary\u201d. \u201cI am disappointed that that\u2019s the attitude. I would have thought it would be good to get this right the first time.\u201d A Coalition frontbencher, Christopher Pyne, said it was crucial the royal commission be quick and smart. \u201c[It\u2019s important] we don\u2019t have a very long, drawn-out royal commission and by the time it actually hands down its recommendations everyone has forgotten what it was about at the beginning,\u201d he said. Brandis said the royal commission could consider and recommend criminal charges, despite the fact legal changes made in 2014 by the Giles government give guards immunity after the elapse of six months after an incident."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
