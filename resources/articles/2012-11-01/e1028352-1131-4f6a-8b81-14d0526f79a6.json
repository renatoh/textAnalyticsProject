Some teams have talented individuals but lack the necessary dedication, others labour like Trojans without possessing the necessary attacking spark. England are familiar with both those scenarios but Stuart Lancaster is sounding more confident about his side's prospects than at any stage in his 11-month tenure. It would, of course, be an unusual national coach who predicts a looming shambles but Lancaster chose his words deliberately as he stressed his desire for England to take a significant leap over the next four weekends. \"I've said to the players it's production time now,\" he revealed, fresh from a sunny morning on the training ground at Bagshot. \"We've got some continuity, we've got some consistency in terms of selection and the coaching team and we've spent some time together. The foundations are strong. Now we want to deliver.\" As calm statements of intent go it could not have been much clearer. For the first few months, amid the continuing fallout from the ill-fated World Cup campaign, Lancaster was mostly firefighting. Despite some promising Six Nations results and a character-laden draw against South Africa in Port Elizabeth in June the management team has often been paddling frantically below the surface. Finally, for the first time since he succeeded Martin Johnson, Lancaster has most of his jigsaw pieces where he wants them. There are one or two frustrations, as there always will be. The hugely promising young Wasps' forward Joe Launchbury is the latest injury call-up as cover in case Tom Palmer suffers a recurrence of the calf problem which prevented him from training last week, while Jonathan Joseph is definitely out of the reckoning for Saturday's game against Fiji because of an ankle strain. Courtney Lawes of Northampton also remains at least a fortnight away from full fitness. On the plus side the Harlequins' prop Joe Marler is back in training and England's other highly rated loosehead, Alex Corbisiero, hopes to return for London Irish at the weekend. James Haskell is available, too, having received only a written warning and a retrospective yellow card for his tackle on Saracens' Alistair Hargreaves on Sunday. With Freddie Burns and Billy Twelvetrees also summoned to impress Lancaster in a 15-a-side practice session on Monday afternoon, there is no room for complacency among those set to be confirmed in the starting XV on Thursday. That team looks all but certain to include the Exeter flanker Tom Johnson and the Saracens full-back Alex Goode, neither of whom have previously started a full international at Twickenham, as Lancaster seeks a flying start against a Fiji team boosted by Gloucester's Akapusi Qera, arguably the stand-out back-row in the Premiership at present. Qera has answered an emergency call to join the injury-hit Fijian squad, as has Exeter's Sireli Naqelevuki. Anyone running into those two invariably knows about it. Lancaster, though, is conscious of the need for his own players to start finishing with the same consistent ruthlessness as New Zealand. An expected sell-out 80,000 crowd will also expect some seasonal fireworks. Ugo Monye and Charlie Sharples are poised to be the starting wings in the absence of the suspended Chris Ashton but neither can light the blue touchpaper single-handed. \"We need to get our fundamentals right otherwise it doesn't matter who you've got on the wings,\" cautioned Lancaster. \"That's been a big focus this week. We want to deliver a high-quality attacking performance in its entirety.\" The fact remains, however, that the absent Ashton has not scored a try for England since for over 13 months while Monye has crossed the line just once in 13 Tests for his country and Sharples has yet to do so. \"There aren't many world-class finishers around and, unfortunately, one of them isn't available this weekend,\" agreed Lancaster, revealing that he had spoken to Ashton about his tackling technique and discipline. \"I've had a chat with him about both areas. One of Chris's real strengths is his competitiveness but it's about tempering that to ensure we get the best out of him. He's more disappointed than anyone that he's not available.\" The head coach also dealt briskly with comments from one of his predecessors, Sir Clive Woodward, that his autumn squad selection has been overly conservative. \"I've always worked on the principle that everyone's entitled to their opinion but very few people know all the information,\" he retorted. \"It's not as simple as just picking names out of a hat.\" Lancaster's England, it is safe to say, will not be lacking for motivation.
