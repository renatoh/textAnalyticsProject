According to the study by the Resolution Foundation, around 2 million UK borrowers who took out risky loans in the years before the financial crash, or who still have high loan-to-value mortgages, may be unprepared for the financial burden of higher interest rates. The Bank is set to raise base rates gradually to 3% over the next couple of years, after keeping them at a historically low 0.5% since 2009. The report will warn that borrowers across the UK need to brace themselves for the end of this unprecedented \"holiday period\". Matthew Whittaker, chief economist at the thinktank and co-author of the study, said: \"We need to act now to ensure that all lenders seek out those customers who are just about keeping their heads above water in the current era of low interest rates in order to help them prepare for a future of higher repayments. Some lenders are already doing this, but it's crucial that the whole industry wakes up to the need to identify and engage with these at-risk customers.\" The report recommends that the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, should require lenders to undertake a financial health check of all vulnerable customers to judge how they would cope with higher repayments. Lenders should also point them to sources of independent financial advice, it will say. Household debt has fallen since the financial crash from around 175% of gross domestic product to 142%, leaving an overhang of \u00a31.5tn. This is expected to rise to \u00a32.2tn by 2018. Much of the debt repayment since the crash has been done by older, better-off borrowers, leaving families and many single people exposed to increased repayments as interest rates rise \u2013 either because they are among the near two-thirds of existing borrowers on variable-rate mortgages, or because they are on fixed-rate deals due to end within the next two to three years. Bank policymakers have voiced concern about the impact of rising interest rates on the UK's 11 million mortgage holders, though their reports are based on a stricter definition of arrears used by the industry, which limits the number of vulnerable households to nearer 400,000. Whittaker said: \"We need to prompt the most at-risk borrowers to confront the reality of what their finances might look like in a few years \u2013 even if it comes as an unwelcome shock to some of them. Many will be able to take evasive action and make plans for the return to an age of more normal interest rates. We mustn't look back at this period and wish we'd done more to prepare ourselves.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
