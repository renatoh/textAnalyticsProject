I'm not all that far into it yet, but it seems quite clear that the most boring aspect of the whole thing is the expectation that every woman finds each birthday increasingly traumatic. I can't be the only one for whom it's really just a bit of a non-issue. Slightly fatter arse and wrinkly face vs the eternal nothingness of death doesn't seem to be all that taxing (or interesting) a conundrum to me. I just wish it wasn't accompanied by all those mealy-mouthed mimsies and their emetic \"You don't look a day over 25 wink wink\" jokes. And what about all the great stuff? Your house is nicer than a nightclub. (This is the tipping point that takes you from \"young\" to \"grown-up\".) You tell people what you really think (except about their hair and boyfriends \u2013 you learned that the hard way). Your post gets so much more interesting.

Whether you're browsing or buying, crack open the HobNobs and enjoy my pick of the bunch\u2026 Me &amp; Em Comfortable luxury 24/7 is the signature of this brand, previously known as the Pajama Room. I love their gorgeous cream swing dress and cracking jacket. Wrap This London label boasts gems like strap boots and an easy-pretty songbird dress. Boden Perennial favourite of mums, Boden clothes are cute and completely life-proof (I live in my Roma trousers). Its new party-ready Limited Collection (online only) includes a beautiful gold lace top, too. Isabella Oliver Lots of women only discover Isabella Oliver when they're pregnant, which is a shame, as the brand is great for well-made wardrobe cornerstones. My black Maryna Kick Dress is a lifesaver and the essential belt really, like, is. Toast As posh as catalogues get, but quietly so (if the Bloomsbury Group were still about, they would shop at Toast). Obviously I want everything, but would settle for their oversize sweater, brogues and stunning silk necklace."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
