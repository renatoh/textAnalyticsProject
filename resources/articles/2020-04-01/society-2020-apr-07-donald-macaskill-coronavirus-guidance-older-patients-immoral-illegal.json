The crisis has rushed the issue to the fore, with growing reports of older and disabled people being earmarked automatically for palliative care only, should they contract Covid-19. To Macaskill, the emergency represents the biggest human-rights challenge since the second world war. \u201cI have never been, nor would I want to be, in a situation where I needed to make that life-or-death decision,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if I was, what I would want is very clear guidance so I knew that somebody had my back. What concerns me is that some of the guidance already beginning to appear around the country is misplaced, immoral and illegal.\u201d Advice for doctors published last week by the British Medical Association says that patient age, \u201cwhere clinically relevant\u201d, could be a factor in predicting survival in decisions about extending or withholding more intensive treatment, including access to ventilators to support breathing. \u201cAge cannot be the sole proxy [for worth], indeed it should not be the primary proxy,\u201d says Macaskill. \u201cThere are many active people in their 70s who would have more beneficial clinical outcomes than, say, somebody in their 50s living with multiple co-morbidities.\u201d The extent of any underlying chronic health conditions, as well as frailty \u201cshould have greater significance than simply age when you have that hellish decision to make\u201d, he adds. Macaskill is calling for an immediate initiative to draw up agreed national guidance, with a process involving not just acute-care doctors and ethicists but also geriatricians, gerontologists and social-care leaders. He believes it could be completed, virtually, within 48 hours. But he says the leadership of politicians would be crucial. \u201cWe should not be leaving this to the clinicians. Critically, they are the ones who are going to have to make and action the heavy choices. We need greater political intervention in the debate and politicians \u2013 with one or two glorious exceptions \u2013 have been remarkably quiet around all this.\u201d At Scottish Care, Macaskill \u2013 who has a background in further and higher education and faith studies \u2013 seeks to apply a human-rights test to all policies and practice. He says he is dismayed by those who wish to scrap the Human Rights Act and dilute the UK\u2019s commitment to the European convention on human rights. \u201cIt\u2019s a historical failure to realise where the modern system of human rights came from, which inescapably was the horrors of the second world war.\u201d Since the coronavirus crisis broke, Macaskill has attracted attention not only for his forceful stance on older people\u2019s right to life, but also for taking on the leading supermarket chains for not giving social-care workers the same access to protected shopping time that they have made available to NHS staff. \u201cWe have staff coming off 12-hour shifts, struggling to get into the local Tesco because at that very time it\u2019s the shopping hour for the NHS,\u201d he says. Smaller care homes that have always shopped locally for supplies, supporting their high street, have also found themselves unable to get what they need. \u201cThey have tried to do the right thing, rather than buy from big multinational chains, and it\u2019s come back to bite them.\u201d Does he think the health and care sector can withstand the crisis? Scotland, he believes, is slightly better placed than the rest of the UK thanks to its relatively small size, greater past investment \u2013 with social-care pay higher and vacancy rates lower than in England \u2013 and earlier planning for the emergency. But coronavirus is already in what he terms \u201ca good number\u201d of care homes, including Burlington Court in Glasgow where 16 deaths in just over a week have been linked to the disease. \u201cPeople are frightened that this virus will strike the most vulnerable and strike in the heart of their care home communities,\u201d he says. He thinks availability of personal protection equipment (PPE) has so far been better than in England, owing to a coordinated distribution model across social care and the NHS. But the picture remains far from ideal, he stresses, and following reports at the weekend of the death of a care worker in West Dumbartonshire he tweeted: \u201cThis is truly tragic. We must make sure frontline care workers have all the PPE they need.\u201d Macaskill warns that health and care will get through only if social care is treated on a par with the health service when it comes to such issues as PPE distribution. \u201cWhat I am very clear on is that if social care remains the handmaiden of the NHS, rather than being seen as an equal sister, then we will not achieve the positive outcomes we all want to see,\u201d he says. \u201cSocial care has to be valued in its own right because it is critical to us beating the virus in the community generally, but in care homes in particular.\u201d The increasingly traumatic events of the past few weeks have helped social care belatedly start to earn proper recognition in policy circles, he thinks. But he fears there remains \u201ca huge distance to travel\u201d in winning it equal status with the NHS in the public mind. \u201cThis crisis will certainly help that,\u201d Macaskill says. \u201cBut will it completely change things?
