In his first season in Italy Mourinho has helped Inter build a nine-point lead at the top of Serie A, culminating in Sunday's 2-1 derby victory over Milan. The Portuguese coach has admitted his frustration with aspects of life in Italy, and also his intention to one day rejoin his former employers. But Ibrahimovic does not expect to part with his manager any time soon. \"He has a long time to go as a trainer before he will think about going back to Chelsea,\" said the Sweden striker. \"He has a contract here and I think he will respect that. He has a lot more to achieve here before anyone can think about him leaving.\" First, reasons Ibrahimovic, Mourinho must help Inter win their fourth consecutive Scudetto. \"We are just over half way there and we are doing a bit better than we were last year. We should continue doing what we did against Milan \u2013 to play with confidence and bravery.\" Ibrahimovic did not score against Milan but he was a constant threat, imbued with confidence by a manager who recently claimed the 27-year-old was \"better than [Cristiano] Ronaldo.\" The player is hardly an overnight success \u2013 he was the world's best-paid player when Mourinho arrived at the club \u2013 but he does believe that Mourinho has lifted him and Inter to a new level. \"I think we were good when he came but he is learning more about Italian football and we are getting stronger and better from it,\" he said. \"He has changed our mentality a bit. We are stronger in the big games. We train differently now, with more intensity. We have only one pitch \u2013 can you believe that? \u2013 but the training is very good.\" Casting an eye towards Inter's city rivals, Ibrahimovic believes it would be \"the right outcome\" for Milan to sign David Beckham on a permanent deal. \"I haven't followed his story every day but big players should absolutely play in big teams and Beckham is one of those,\" he said. \"He has done well for Milan, he is a good team player and has helped them a lot since he arrived at the club. \"I think he is becoming very important for them, especially in the way he plays, because he is a great team player and they have other players with different qualities.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
