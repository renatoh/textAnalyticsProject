Over and over again,\u201d Thunberg tweeted on Sunday alongside a video showing the aftermath of a drive-by shooting targeting indigenous leaders that left two dead. \u201cIt is shameful that the world remains silent about this,\u201d the 16-year-old campaigner added. Bolsonaro \u2013 who activists accuse of green-lighting a new era of destruction and violence with his hardline anti-environment rhetoric \u2013 hit back on Tuesday. \u201cGreta\u2019s been saying Indians have died because they were defending the Amazon,\u201d a smirking Bolsonaro told reporters outside the presidential palace in Brazil\u2019s capital, Bras\u00edlia. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how much space the press gives this kind of pirralha,\u201d Bolsonaro added, using a Portuguese word that loosely translates as \u201clittle brat\u201d or \u201cpest\u201d. Bolsonaro had initially failed to remember Thunberg\u2019s name, labelling her simply \u201cthat girl\u201d. Thunberg appeared to take Bolsonaro\u2019s disparagement as a badge of honour, changing her Twitter biography to \u201cPirralha\u201d. Thunberg is far from alone in challenging Bolsonaro over the spike in rainforest destruction and attacks on indigenous communities during his first year in power. Brazil\u2019s Indigenous Missionary Council rights group reported in September that 153 indigenous territories had been invaded since the start of 2019 \u2013 more than twice last year\u2019s figure of 76 \u2013 and said Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201caggressive\u201d talk was partly responsible. Recent weeks have seen a spate of deadly attacks on indigenous activists. After Saturday\u2019s killings in the northern state of Maranh\u00e3o, Brazil\u2019s former environment minister, Marina Silva, tweeted: \u201cThis Amazon bloodbath demands a strong and swift response from Brazilian authorities.\u201d \u201cWe have been cut adrift and left unprotected by the Brazilian state,\u201d wrote S\u00f4nia Guajajara, a prominent indigenous leader. In a recent interview, the Amazon senator Randolfe Rodrigues said Brazil\u2019s native peoples stood at a historic juncture as Bolsonaro pushed ahead with plans to open their lands to commercial mining. \u201cNot since the [1964-85] dictatorship have Brazil\u2019s indigenous peoples felt as threatened as they do now,\u201d Rodrigues said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
