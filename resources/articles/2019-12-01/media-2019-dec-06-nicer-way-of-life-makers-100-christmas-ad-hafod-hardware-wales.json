People pop in to buy nails, screws, perhaps a replacement mophead, a mousetrap or a pot of paint to spruce up their homes for the festive period. But this week it has been rather busier for Thomas Lewis Jones and Pauline Lewis, the shop\u2019s grandson and grandmother team. A two-minute Christmas video advertising the traditional ironmongers on East Street starring Jones\u2019s two-year-old son, Arthur, has gone viral. More than a million people worldwide have viewed the film, which only cost \u00a3100 to make, and the phone has been ringing continuously with people keen to explain how much it touched them. \u201cI think it has struck a chord because it\u2019s such a simple message,\u201d said Jones. \u201cIt\u2019s real and it\u2019s not saying: \u2018Spend, spend, spend.\u2019 I think you can tell it\u2019s made by people who care about this business.\u201d Many have said the film captures the true spirit of Christmas more effectively than the multimillion-pound efforts that normally hit the headlines at this time of year. Jones is too polite and modest to compare his film to John Lewis\u2019s Edgar the dragon epic. \u201cBut I think it shows you don\u2019t necessarily need CGI and a huge budget,\u201d he said. The plot of the Hafod Hardware film is not complicated. Arthur wakes up, brushes his teeth, eats breakfast and heads to the shop. He serves customers, decorates a Christmas tree \u2013 and in the final shot magically turns into his 30-year-old dad. Jones and his friend, the film-maker Josh Holdaway, spent a few hours last Saturday making the advert. The \u00a3100 went on hiring a studio for a friend to record the soundtrack, a cover of Alpahville\u2019s Forever Young. At a time when UK high streets are struggling, it is heartening that a simple film featuring a family hardware store in a small mid-Wales town (population: 2,000) can cause such as stir. Hafod Hardware has been in the family for just under a century. Sepia-tinted photos of some of the ancestors hang above the office door. It is hard to know what they would have made of the fuss. Hafod is a Welsh word referring to the movement of people and livestock from lowland winter pasture to higher summer grazing. Pauline Lewis and her husband, Alan, took over 20 years ago and live above the shop. As a teenager, Jones went off to university to study art but did not take to it and 10 years ago, at the age of 20, returned to Rhayader and began to work in the shop. It was supposed to be a stopgap. Jones was in a band and thought a full-time career in music beckoned. But the band broke up and Jones found that, actually, he liked working in the shop. \u201cI like being part of the community. You know everyone in the town. People pop in and say hello even if they don\u2019t need anything. I love it here.\u201d He married Laura, whom he had known since primary school (she does the accounts for the shop), and he hasn\u2019t looked back. The few downsides are the jokes about the grocery shop sitcom Open All Hours and the number of customers who like to launch into the Two Ronnies\u2019 four candles/fork handles hardware store sketch. This year\u2019s Christmas film is Jones\u2019s third for the store. The 2017 one made a few headlines in the local media. The 2018 film did not garner much attention. They weren\u2019t planning to do a third but local people encouraged them to make another. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to let them down,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAnd then it snowballed.\u201d Jones\u2019s grandmother bursts with pride. \u201cTom has brought us into the 21st century,\u201d she said. Rather than contracting as the high street has struggled, the shop has doubled in size. As well as hardware staples, it sells fly fishing rods to tourists keen to try their luck on the River Wye, and maps and camping equipment for those on their way to the Cambrian mountains. Jones\u2019s artwork \u2013 local views in the style of 1930s Great Western Railway posters \u2013 also sell well. But the ongoing success has been to provide solid old-fashioned service. They deliver free to the town. If an older person needs a lightbulb and cannot reach to fit it, Jones will do it for them. He is not a trained locksmith but if someone is locked out of their home, he finds a way to help. His gran thinks the video may have done so well because it is a break from grim everyday life in 2019. \u201cPeople are so fed up with the news and the situation we are in. It speaks about different life values, it\u2019s nostalgic \u2013 it shows a calmer, nicer way of life.\u201d Footfall hasn\u2019t increased dramatically since the video was posted \u2013 after all, Rhayader is remote \u2013 but Jones hopes it may encourage more people to shop locally wherever they happen to be. One of the most touching messages came in a card from a Cornish couple called Bill and Sue, who said they would be visiting Wales in the summer and planned a pilgrimage to Hafod Hardware. \u201cTo Arthur and his daddy and mummy,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThank you for reminding us of the true spirit of Christmas with your beautiful film, which touched our hearts.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
