The software, called Vocaloid, is a \"singing engine\": type in lyrics and a melody and it carries out the complex mathematical operations needed to generate a voice singing the words to the right tune. The actual sound that emerges depends on which voice font, or virtual vocalist, is used with the software. The first sound fonts available for Vocaloid, a male soul voice called Leon and a female soul voice called Lola, have been produced by Cornwall-based sound library Zero-G. To create the fonts, two real singers each spent a week in the company's studio recording thousands of different singing sounds and transitions between sounds from a pre-arranged script. A further 6,000 man-hours was then required to process the sounds and turn them into what is in effect a 600MB database of voice snippets. To produce realistic vocals when words and music are typed in, Vocaloid retrieves the appropriate snippets to assemble the right words, alters their pitch according to the tune, and splices them together to produce smooth-sounding singing. \"The result is a clone of each singer's voice, with exactly the same tone, pronunciation and intonation as the real people,\" says Ed Stratton, former record producer and Zero-G's managing director. \"What you get is singing that is perfectly in tune, but totally expressionless and inhumanly flat. To add emotion you then have to adjust various parameters: add vibrato, fiddle around with the timing of each sound to make it more natural, slide up to a note rather than hitting it straightaway. For backing vocals, you can do this quite quickly and you can't tell the difference between a human and the computer. For an exposed lead vocal, where you want to hear much more expression and artistry, it's much harder.\" Since experienced backing singers charge fees of up to \u00a31,000 per day, the software, at just under \u00a3200 per font, may soon start replacing them as an inexpensive alternative. That's why the singers whose voices were used to produce the Lola and Leon sound fonts have chosen to remain anonymous. But Miriam Stockley, the identity behind Zero-G's next sound font, Miriam, has no such qualms. Stockley has sung on recordings by artists including Elton John, Tina Turner and George Michael, and believes that since voice fonts of named singers will inevitably become available, she may as well be the first. \"It took me a couple of months to make the decision to make the Miriam virtual vocalist, as I had all the normal fears that it would simply replace me in the market,\" Stockley says. \"But if I hear my virtual voice singing a song it definitely won't be me singing, as it won't have my nuances and artistry. That could only happen if the person using the software knew me very well indeed - and the only person who knows me well enough is me.\" Stockley plans to put this self-knowledge into practice by replacing her real voice with her virtual one on some of the backing tracks on her next recordings. Vocaloid may also be used in the advertising industry as an inexpensive way to experiment with different words in musical jingles. Once the necessary expression and nuance settings have been made, the jingles could then be tailored for different markets simply by switching from a male to a female voice font, or a younger to an older one, or a voice with a southern accent to a voice with a Scottish one. In the future, the software could prove a boon if you're interested in singing on your own recordings - but have a terrible singing voice. Instead of using Lola, Leon or Miriam, you could have your own voice turned into a voice font for the lead and backing vocals. \"It would sound like your voice singing, but it would be perfectly in tune, and you would be able to sing much higher and lower than you really could,\" says Stratton. \"You would have great technique with beautiful vibrato, as if you had done years of study, and your expression would be far beyond what you could really do,\" he says. For the moment, however, there are no plans to allow individuals to create their own voice fonts. When this does become possible, it may even be feasible to create voice fonts from sounds cut from recordings of singers from the past, with thetantalising possibility of bringing their voices back from the dead for contemporary recordings.
