A bill for trans people to self-identify is a good start", "bodyText": "When the Victorian Andrews Labor government introduced a bill to parliament on Tuesday that would give transgender, intersex and non-binary people the right to self-nominate the sex and gender identification on their birth certificate, I greeted this news with equal parts excitement and caution. As a transgender Victorian, our community have been here before: in 2016 a bill to reform legislation around gender identity on birth certificates was introduced by Labor but denied by the Liberal National Coalition. If this new bill is passed, the proposed legislation presents a major leap forward in life chances for gender diverse Victorians. It brings Victoria up to speed with Western Australia, the Australian Capital Territory, South Australia, the Northern Territory and Tasmania, all of which have removed the prerequisite for gender affirmation surgery to change the sex indicator on birth certificates progressively since 2011. In 2013 the Gillard government changed the federal guidelines on recognition of sex and gender to allow people to change gender markers on passports and Medicare by providing medical and psychologist statements. As much as the rights of trans and gender diverse people didn\u2019t start with marriage equality in 2018, they will not end with self-identification on birth certificates. There is more to do. Changing the legislation presents a critical step in ensuring the life chances of trans and gender diverse people are realised to their full potential. It also removes gender affirming surgery as inextricably linked politically and lawfully to birth certificates. This often forces people into considerations about their bodies they might otherwise not have to make. Not all transgender, intersex and non-binary people require surgery. Let\u2019s relieve trans people of that burden and that cost. In real terms, getting top and/or bottom surgery comes at a huge price, and gender affirmation surgeries are inaccessible for many trans and gender diverse people. In Australia, costs for surgeries that qualify as a prerequisite for birth certificate changes vary from $15,000 tomore than $100,000. For many trans and gender diverse people, these procedures are lifesaving medical treatments \u2013 most or all of which is not covered by Medicare rebates. They are financed out of the pockets of individuals, families and community fundraising. For others, it\u2019s the cost of a first car, rent for a year, a deposit on a house or a superannuation investment. That kind of money is a start in life or a retirement fund. Don\u2019t get me started on the non-refundable fee of $74.90 to get the registrar of births, deaths and marriages to fix their admin. While trans and gender diverse people in the eastern mainland states wait for the democratic process to recognise their basic human right to self-identify, they are subjected to discrimination through existing birth certificates that indicate incorrect sex or gender. At the core of systemic transphobia is administrative violence. \u201cThe categorisation of people works as a key method on control,\u201d writes Dean Spade in his 2015 book Normal Life, meaning sex or gender indicators on our birth certificates adversely affect basic rights to education, employment, social security, health insurance, public amenity, international travel and incarceration. While the local football league or community radio station probably don\u2019t need to know the detail of one\u2019s trans status, being outed at Centrelink or to an employer through a superannuation provider shouldn\u2019t happen to anyone. It is a breach of our rights to privacy. Personal histories of gender change should not be recorded as they risk disclosing the status of individuals who would otherwise retain that knowledge. Surveillance methods for international travel through border security checkpoints are most concerning here: where recorded changes in gender expose trans and gender diverse people to interrogation, risking deportation. A 2019 paper Hacking the Cis-tem, by Marie Hicks from Illinois Institute of Technology, found administrative violence extends to transphobic algorithmic biases in new technologies used in computerised methods for identification, definitions and surveillance of UK citizens through government-issued ID cards. This week a Melbourne priest, Fr Tony Kerin, said on ABC radio that the Catholic church did not \u201capprove or appreciate\u201d the proposed reform: \u201cWhen it comes to gender, we stick with the science; we count chromosomes.\u201d I always face-palm when some religious types selectively drop science, usually when it comes to shitting on trans people. I hate to break it to you Father, but there is no such thing as biological gender. I\u2019m proof of that. As the American writer and activist Julia Serano said in her 2013 book Excluded: \u201cTo shatter the glass ceiling, we must first learn to move beyond biology and give ourselves permission to become anything we want to be.\u201d Sex identification is forced upon us as we are all coercively assigned gender at birth without consent. Perhaps instead of parents throwing gender-reveal parties, starting fires in national parks or getting alligators to pop pink or blue powdered balloons with their teeth, we should give people space to reveal their own gender. As musician Evelyn Ida Morris tweeted: \u201cThere will still be cake.\u201d Ultimately legislating for trans and gender diverse people to self-identify breeds self-esteem: a good start at best. Our gender \u2013 at birth or throughout life \u2013 is not for others to decide. I\u2019m glad I live in a state that is proactive in equality reform that benefits the life chances of transgender, non-binary and intersex people. If the bill becomes law, we can\u2019t just sit in our own privilege while other gender diverse people live under regimes that seek to wind back protections or eliminate them from the record altogether. Victoria\u2019s politicians have a chance to do a solid for gender diverse Victorians this time. I\u2019m hopeful we get the numbers across the line. It will change our lives for the better. \u2022 Simona Castricum is a musician, a PhD candidate in architecture at the University of Melbourne, a broadcaster on Melbourne\u2019s 3PBS FM, and a member of Music Victoria\u2019s women\u2019s advisory panel \u2022 Comments on this article have been pre-moderated to ensure the discussion is on the topics that have been written about in the article"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
