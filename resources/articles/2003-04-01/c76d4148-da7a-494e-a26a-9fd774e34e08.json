UKBlogs aggregates lots of bloggers - Black Belt Jones and bowblog are really good ones. Journalism.co.uk and TheiSociety.net from the Work Foundation. NowEurope.com which talks about the European web scene makes a change. Babycentre.co.uk, since my wife is due in July and I can read about prams. Last online purchase? Software for my Handspring treo 270 - a palm pilot and a phone in one which is very useful. Domaindirect.com for when I buy domain names. Ever been in a chat room? Only teenagers and contributors to BBC Online go into chat rooms - they are pretty messy, dull places. The best conversations arise from instant messaging with friends. Most recent technological faux pas? Recently I had a Sex and the City moment. I have the same laptop as Carrie and it died on me. As in the episode, everyone was saying \"didn't you back it up?\", and I said I had, which was a white lie since I last backed it up about a year ago. Main news source on the web? Google news, NewsNow. For breaking news, the Guardian does a great job. Specialist stuff such as the Register and NetImperative. Most useful website? Google, and spin-offs like Googlism.com are fun. Least useful website? Any sites that don't give you contact information, a phone number or even a physical address, are frustrating. Do you use a screensaver? No, they are pretty useless. People just surf the net instead. There are some developments such as the ability to crunch numbers to fight diseases like cancer and smallpox. When your computer is in downtime, your screensaver can switch on, connect to the net and crunch numbers - it's called grid computing. Most irritating thing about the internet? Some sites insist on cramming their sites with images and junk. Also, the internet is everywhere and you can't escape it. What type of online business is least likely to succeed? A large bloated one formed around April 2000... People got confused about online businesses - the internet is not a big business it's a small one. It's a way of reaching a lot of people with small, clever, fast-moving ideas. Do you still bother with old media? I love the look and feel of magazines. I get FHM, GQ, New Statesman. The pace of the war means the rolling TV news, especially Sky, has scooped the internet.
