City's manager faces an anxious wait to discover the seriousness of Bellamy's problem after the striker came off complaining of discomfort in his knee. Whereas the rest of the squad returned to Manchester, Bellamy remained in the capital for tomorrow's check-up and looks likely to miss Wednesday's game against Aston Villa at the very least. So do Robinho, who hurt an ankle, and Micah Richards, who was substituted with a hamstring problem. Hughes needs a strong end to the season to ensure he continues at City and fears that Robinho, his top scorer, will be out for several matches. \"He got tackled on the edge of the box late on in the match and he thinks he has got a similar injury to when we played Arsenal a while back and which forced him to miss a number of games,\" Hughes said. \"The likelihood is that he will miss Wednesday.\" \"We just hope [Bellamy] will be fit and well for Wednesday as he's been outstanding for us so far,\" said the manager, whose team have won just one of their past five league matches. Hughes admitted today the club's away form is a \"real concern\" and it cannot help that their next league trip is to Chelsea on 15 March. By then, City could be just three points above the relegation zone should they lose to Villa."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
