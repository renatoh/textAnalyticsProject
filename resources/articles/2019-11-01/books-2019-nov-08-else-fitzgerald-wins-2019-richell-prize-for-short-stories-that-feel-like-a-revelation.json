They owned a nursery in regional Victoria. \u201cWe lived our lives by the weather,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cSo I have this fascination with how people deal with the challenges of climate change.\u201d Now, the 33-year-old has won this year\u2019s $10,000 Richell prize for emerging writers for Nearly Curtains, a collection of stories drawing on that fascination. Nearly Curtains explores a future ravaged by climate crisis and the divergent responses to it \u2013 from couples questioning whether or not they ought to have children, to the roles technologies such as genetic manipulation may play in how humanity adapts to the changing world. The Richell prize, supported by Hachette Australia, Guardian Australia and the Emerging Writers\u2019 festival, was established in 2015 and is open to emerging writers of both fiction and narrative non-fiction. The judging panel \u2013 including Robert Watkins, the head of literary at Hachette Australia; authors Hannah Richell and Sarah Schmidt; and Steve Sines, bookseller at Potts Point Bookshop \u2013 hailed Nearly Curtains as \u201ca firework show of bursting ideas\u201d. \u201cThe strength of Nearly Curtains is more than its beautiful prose, characterisation and concept: here is an emerging writer who has captured the heart of humanity in crisis with such insight that it feels like a revelation,\u201d the judges\u2019 report said. \u201cAt the moment I don\u2019t know how I could be writing about anything else,\u201d Fitzgerald told Guardian Australia. \u201c[Climate crisis] feels really big and urgent and you can\u2019t ignore it.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Fitzgerald said working through her own emotional responses to the climate crisis \u2013 from \u201csheer terror\u201d at worst, to trying to think through how to cope \u2013 was a constant preoccupation. The question about whether or not to have children is \u201cone of those things I\u2019ve certainly had to wrestle with\u201d, she said \u2013 a question the characters in one of her stories, Fertile Ground, also grapple with. \u201cFor our generation there is a particular set of challenges. I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s necessarily unique to us. Our parents and the generations before them have had their own things to surmount, whether that\u2019s nuclear crisis or the second world war.\u201d Fitzgerald\u2019s manuscript was chosen from 704 entries, whittled down to a shortlist of six. Hachette has published six books by winning or shortlisted writers since the prize first opened in 2015. \u201cThe timing is amazing for me because I\u2019ve just come off the back of 18 months of working all of these different jobs, sometimes five or six at a time,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve had such an erratic schedule, it\u2019s been challenging to find time to really get into the writing project. Winning something like the Richell prize just means that I will have a bit of time to focus on finishing off this manuscript.\u201d Along with the money, the prize also includes a 12-month mentorship with publishing house Hachette Australia. Fitzgerald, who previously worked for the Emerging Writers festival, was effusive about the difference opportunities like the prize made for emerging writers. \u201cThe money is one thing but the guidance and support that you get for a year \u2013 I can\u2019t even begin to explain how valuable and special that is,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
