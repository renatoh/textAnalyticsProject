Former players including Cyrille Regis and John Barnes were furious recently after claims that they were backing a breakaway union for black players. However, there is growing support for a lobby group to raise issues such as the lack of black coaches and managers and the near-complete absence of Asian professional footballers in Britain. The lobbying group would liaise with the Professional Footballers' Association, and the FA, and also raise issues with politicians in an attempt to get the game to respond to areas of concern. It also hopes to work in an advisory capacity with organisations such as PriceWaterhouse Coopers and Kick It Out who draw up regular reports into the state of football."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
