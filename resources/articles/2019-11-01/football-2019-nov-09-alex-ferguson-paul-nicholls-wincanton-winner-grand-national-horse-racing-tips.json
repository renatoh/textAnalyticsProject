The chestnut held on by a rapidly diminishing neck and is now considered a live contender for the Grand National in April. Sir Alex admitted this was his first visit to Wincanton, a surprising oversight for a racing fan who has been retired for six years, but perhaps he was waiting for the right horse to bring him to south Somerset\u2019s finest racecourse. \u201cTo get a win like this and the excitement at the end, you can\u2019t beat it,\u201d he said, which is surely one in the eye for anyone who thinks football cannot be matched for thrills. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it, to be honest,\u201d he added and that much was clear from the jubilant celebrations as Give Me A Copper passed the post. Sir Alex\u2019s shoulders were pounded by the winning trainer, Paul Nicholls, and he was then hoisted in the air by his co-owner, Ged Mason. Drinks were sent tumbling. \u201cI was covered in coffee and then Paul\u2019s tryin\u2019 to strangle me \u2026\u201d The outcome was a double relief for Nicholls, who has long cherished hopes for the horse but was beginning to wonder if he would always be held back by the effects of an injury two years ago. Until Give Me A Copper came good, this had been a long day at his local track, with five fancied runners all failing to score. \u201cLittle things niggled him last year, we never had him right,\u201d Nicholls said. \u201cHe\u2019s always had loads of ability, he\u2019s just had a few little problems. He\u2019s had the odd bleed, he\u2019s had a bit of everything. I said to Alex, he\u2019s like one of your players who\u2019s a nightmare to train. He said [that] all the good ones are problems.\u201d Nicholls had wanted to get a racecourse gallop into Give Me A Copper here a fortnight ago but the ground was too quick at the time, and he fretted that the horse\u2019s fitness might let him down. In the circumstances, Harry Cobden did well to get occasional breathers into his mount during the three-mile contest. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely one I\u2019d be aiming for the National,\u201d Nicholls added. He outlined a tentative plan to run the horse in the Becher or the Grand Sefton next month and possibly go straight to the National thereafter. The Ditcheat trainer has now won the Badger Beers 10 times. His other runner, Present Man, might have been a more popular winner, having landed the race for the past two years and being the mount of Bryony Frost, but 11mm of morning rain made the ground too testing for him and he was pulled up. Soupy Soups finished powerfully to be second for the Neil Mulholland yard. that won and then lost this race five years ago, when The Young Master was disqualified. The fancied White Moon charted a wide course, jumped poorly and was tailed off by the home turn. Fusil Raffles did not quite live up to his reputation with a battling success in the Elite Hurdle but Nicky Henderson said the young hurdler would benefit greatly for the run."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
