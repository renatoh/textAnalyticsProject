Pierce was beaten by Venus Williams and Mauresmo beat Anastasia Myskina. Heads of government will discuss the final wording of the G8 communique or communiques in Gleneagles, not heads of state, as we had it in yesterday's front-page report headlined Blair may snub US on climate. In a review of a performance by John Dankworth and Cleo Laine, page 18, early edition, June 21, we suggested that Dame Cleo Laine was \"now in her 80s\". According to Who's Who (and the Guardian Birthdays database) she was born on October 28 1927, making her 77. We misspelled the surname of Salim Mitha, director of Yahoo Search UK and Ireland, as Meta in an Online feature headlined Scratching the surface, Life, page 16, June 30. The dates given in yesterday's Friday Review for the BBC World Service broadcasts of Gary Barker's World of Music were wrong. The programmes are on July 3, 10, 17 and 24 (Travels with my horn, page 11). The readers' editor writes on page 22 on plans for reader's responses in the forthcoming new format Guardian.
