She has to be. She's a fashion designer who lives in and works from Auckland, New Zealand, which is about as far away from the centre of the fashion world as it is possible to be. 'We're looking at building a global business,' she says. 'Wherever you're based, it doesn't make a difference. As a designer, you don't need to be there because your clothes are there on your behalf.' And her clothes do her proud, each one her personal ambassador, hanging on the rails at Barneys in New York and LA, Colette in Paris, Joyce in Hong Kong, and b store and Euphoria in London, as well as in 60 stores in Japan. Walker also has her own shops - three in New Zealand and another on the way in Sydney, Australia. Her collections have quirky, oddball titles, like Daddy's Gone Strange, the first collection she showed on the runway in Hong Kong in 1998, and the collection coming into stores now called Holly Hobbie Wraps Up Warm. It's not often that you see a collection of clothes that makes you want to own them all. But when Walker, 32, and her husband and business partner, Mikhail, came to London last spring to show off the new collection, I have to confess that I did something I very rarely do. I put in an order for a coat. Summer had barely begun, but I found myself wishing for winter, or autumn at least, just so I could wear it. There was something quite irresistible about it - the feelgood factor, as Walker describes it. 'It's comfort dressing. I wanted to feel loved, cosy, comfy_ happy memories of childhood, innocence and naivety,' she says. The Holly Hobbie element comes from childhood memories of her dressing table full of Holly knick-knacks like talcum powder, girly things. She was also inspired by the 1985 movie The Breakfast Club : 'Ally Sheedy plays the weirdo who sits at the back of class, hiding behind her fringe.' The new collection is everything the class weirdo could wish for. These are not flashy clothes. They are in shades of mossy green, washed-out blues, khaki and sludgy brown. The fabrics all look worn-in and loved; bobbly wool boucl\u00e9s, textured wooden buttons and beads, and homely stripy knits. And with their hand-carved wooden accessories - a moon-shaped brooch and star earrings all carved by Dennis, a colourful character who only works at night and teaches Maori tribesmen how to carve from the native rimu tree - they fit perfectly with the new mood in fashion. 'In Europe and America, partly because of September 11 and the state of the economy, there's a move towards dressing down, which is what we're about,' explains Walker. 'We're a high casual brand.' It is perhaps the sense that Walker's clothes are not a product of the slick and glossy fashion machine that makes them so right for now. 'Fashion is still an awakening thing in New Zealand,' she says. 'There wasn't much for me to look at as a role model when I was growing up.' There was just Holly Hobbie and a steady diet of TV from the UK and the US. Fashion did not exist. As a six-year-old, Walker began making clothes on her mother's old Bernina sewing machine - circular skirts by the hundred for her Barbie doll. By the age of 10 she had moved on to making clothes for herself. Her first success was a pair of khaki knickerbockers with gold piping. 'From a very early age, I had definite ideas of what I would and wouldn't wear,' Walker says. But as a fledgling fashion designer, she had no one to look to. There was, however, a fashion college in Auckland, and when she graduated in 1990 she was already selling clothes to stores throughout New Zealand. By 1995, she was selling in Australia too, and had already opened two shops. Now the country even has its own fashion week - in October - although Walker's attitude towards catwalk shows is as unconventional as her Auckland headquarters. She has shown in London for several seasons, as part of the New Zealand Four along with World, Zambesi and Nom D. But she is just as happy to let the collections sell themselves, away from they hyper-tense world of the runways. 'Why do you have to do a show? Why do you have to work in Paris?' she asks. Walker herself is her own best advert. She is dark-haired, striking and always dresses in her own clothes simply because they are what she wants to wear. A perk of her job is wearing the collections a season early. And hearing her talk, it makes you wonder why the fashion weeks of Milan, Paris and London are so overcrowded. 'I've got 12 acres of forest, live three minutes from the city, I'm near one of the most beautiful beaches in the world and my family too. Maybe Auckland is not the traditional centre of the fashion world, but it seems to be working fine so far.' She lives in a 1932 Art Deco wedding cake of a house on top of a hill, with a little orchard, a paddock, a small swimming pool in the forest, and four wild ducks who have moved into the back yard. Walker admits that she gets cabin fever if she stays there too long, but travels for three to four months each year. If the fashion world won't go to her (and she doesn't really want it to), she can easily go to it. 'We never want the collections to look like they've come from fashion,' she says, 'but from somewhere altogether more innocent.' And it's not hard to see where that place is."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
