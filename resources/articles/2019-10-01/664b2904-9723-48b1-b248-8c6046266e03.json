At that stage Quadrilateral was only mid-division and apparently struggling to bridge the gap as the leaders started to kick for home. \u201cI thought, we\u2019re not going well, we\u2019re coming off the bridle and it\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Roger Charlton, the winner\u2019s trainer, said. Jason Watson, Quadrilateral\u2019s 19-year-old jockey, kept pushing, his partner kept finding more and though Powerful Breeze still had a useful lead going into the final furlong, the favourite caught her with a few strides to spare. \u201cShe kept responding and I thought she did really well to get there,\u201d Charlton said. \u201cShe fought like a good\u2019un and handled the track, it was a great effort really. It took us a bit by surprise that she won so easily [at Newbury] last time but that was a proper test and she did it 100%.\u201d Quadrilateral, a daughter of Frankel, is top-priced at 7-1 favourite [from 14-1] for next May\u2019s 1,000 -Guineas. Her win was both a first Group One for Charlton with a filly and Watson\u2019s first Group One success in Britain at the end of a very successful debut season as Charlton\u2019s stable jockey. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad ending to the year when we\u2019ve had two Group Twos, two Group Ones,\u201d Charlton said. \u201cDon\u2019t forget he hasn\u2019t yet been riding in races for two years. It\u2019s a big ask to expect someone as young as that to deliver and also it\u2019s a lot of pressure. If you finish third or fourth, there will be lots of people saying: \u2018Ryan Moore wouldn\u2019t have done that\u2019 or whatever. \u201cIt\u2019s a big ask, we\u2019ve had faith in him and tried to give him confidence and the relationship is very good.\u201d Love, already a Group One winner in the Moyglare Stud Stakes, finished third, while Cayenne Pepper was only fourth after getting outpaced a quarter of a mile out. She finished strongly and should not be written off yet as a potential Classic filly next year, quite possibly at further than a mile. Robbie Downey, a 24-year-old jockey who had two rides at York yesterday, has insisted independent tests on samples of his hair in recent months prove he has never taken cocaine, despite a urine sample from the rider taken in France on 19 June testing positive for a metabolite of the Class A drug. Downey is planning an appeal against a six-month ban for the positive test imposed by a France Galop disciplinary panel on 3 October. Details of the hearing and penalty, which is due to begin on 24 October, emerged yesterday, when Downey also published the results of tests on a 4cm sample of his hair at two laboratories in Britain and France. In a statement, Downey said he is \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d to have been found in breach of the rules and France Galop \u201chas ignored the medical evidence I have presented which shows I have not taken cocaine\u201d. Paul Struthers, the chief executive of the Professional Jockeys\u2019 -Association, said yesterday that the PJA would support Downey\u2019s appeal and may also ask the British -Horseracing Authority not to reciprocate the ban in Britain, which is normally automatic. \u201cAs soon as Robbie was informed his A sample had returned a positive result, he immediately paid for a hair sample at an accredited British laboratory in order to prove his innocence,\u201d Struthers said. \u201cHe also paid for a second hair sample at an accredited French laboratory and both of these tests returned negative. \u201cRobbie will be lodging an appeal against the decision and if that appeal fails he will then apply to the BHA, who have been kept appraised of the situation throughout this process, for the suspension not to be reciprocated.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
