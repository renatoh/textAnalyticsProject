The chairman of Enron, Kenneth Lay, faced fresh allegations that he deliberately urged employees to buy doomed stock in his company, knowing that its books had become 'an accounting hoax', and after selling off his own shares. Democrats Henry Waxman and John Dingell are proposing civil litigation to break Cheney's silence on six meetings he held with Lay and other Enron executives to discuss America's emergency energy plan. The plan, they say, contained 17 detailed points, all 'virtually identical to positions Enron advocated' - mostly concerned with deregulation and increased capacity, rather than conservation. Cheney has refused to disclose the contents of the meetings, citing executive privilege. There is furious debate in the White House over whether the Vice-President should remain silent or obey the normal rule of wise scandal management in Washington: full and fast disclosure. Cheney took office amid concern that he was too close to the energy industry. He left the government of Bush's father to become chairman of Halliburton, the world's biggest oil drilling equipment manufacturer, and later returned to politics declaring a personal fortune worth tens of millions. On Friday, it was revealed that Cheney stepped in to try to help Enron collect a $64 million debt from a giant energy project in Dabhol, near Bombay, owned primarily by Enron. The highest level contact was at a meeting between Cheney and the leader of India's opposition, Sonia Gandhi, on 27 June. Emails obtained by investigators show that Lay was expected in Washington about that time, but they do not specify whether the visit coincided with one of his meetings with Cheney. The White House counters that it is not unusual for Presidents to make such representations, citing contacts between the company and Bill Clinton's trade secretary, Ron Brown. But documents and emails show that Cheney's meetings not only wentwell beyond trade department duty, but also were co-ordinated with the President's National Security Council. An incriminating email of 28 June, written by an aide to the NSC, reads: 'Good News is that the Veep [Vice-President] mentioned Enron in his meeting with Sonia Gandhi yesterday.' As late as November, President Bush was ready to urge the cause of Enron at a meeting with the Indian Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. But, suddenly, the plan was scrapped. 'President Bush cannot talk about Enron,' reads an email, the sender and recipient of which have been blacked out. On the same day, 8 November, Enron filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission revising its financial statements to account for $586m in losses. It was also the day the company decided it could no longer hide the dirty secret that it had been slushing millions of dollars to tax havens offshore, and Lay called Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill to plead for help."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
