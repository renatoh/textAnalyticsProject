National Museum Cardiff has put on display a painting of a Madonna and child that had for decades been dismissed as a crude copy of Botticelli\u2019s style. Ironically, it had been thought a Botticelli by the collector, Gwendoline Davies, who bequeathed it in 1952. Experts soon began to doubt that and downgraded it to the status of copy. The story of the rediscovery has been documented in an episode from the BBC Four series Britain\u2019s Lost Masterpieces, which features a team of art detectives led by the art historian Bendor Grosvenor. He recalled seeing the painting in the museum store and being struck by the \u201cextraordinary beauty\u201d of the Madonna\u2019s face. \u201cDespite all the overpaint, parts of it reminded me of Botticelli\u2019s most famous painting, The Birth of Venus. I\u2019m now convinced that Botticelli played an important part in its production, and am delighted it has once more gone on public display.\u201d It was cleaning and analysis by the conservator Simon Gillespie that revealed the remarkable quality of the painting. Infra-red photographs showed under-drawing typical of Botticelli\u2019s studio, together with numerous changes in areas like the hands, proving that the painting was not a simple copy. Also revealed was a doodle almost certainly by Botticelli \u2013 a profile drawing of a man\u2019s head made before the painting was finished. Gillespie discovered that the arched background was the work of a forger, added in the early 20th century, probably to hide the fact that the painting had been significantly reduced in size from a larger work. It has been decided to keep the added background to reflect the painting\u2019s history. Gillespie said the work had been both nerve-racking and thrilling. \u201cWe had to proceed millimetre by millimetre, given the fragility of the panel and the original paint layers. Removing the dirt and old varnish to reveal the true beauty of the Madonna\u2019s features felt like witnessing the rebirth of a masterpiece.\u201d The museum has also been involved in the research and conservation. Adam Webster, chief conservator at National Museum Wales, said the project showed the crucial role conservation plays in the proper understanding or our heritage. \u201cWe are delighted with and grateful for the results. The painting now sits beautifully in our galleries and I hope fans of the series will come and enjoy this masterpiece.\u201d Laurence Kanter, chief curator of Yale University Art Gallery and an expert in Botticelli\u2019s works, said: \u201cClearly this beautiful painting came from Botticelli\u2019s studio. Probably Botticelli himself is responsible for more than a bit of it. A great deal more study is needed to solve the riddles of \u2018how much\u2019, \u2018what parts\u2019, \u2018why\u2019, \u2018when\u2019, and hopefully the painting can now be studied further by scholars and the public alike.\u201d \u2022 BBC Four\u2019s Britain\u2019s Lost Masterpieces can be viewed on the iPlayer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
