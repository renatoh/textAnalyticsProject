This is a colourful and imaginative title, with six themed tables (including Medieval, Aquatic and Dino) and a good supply of secret bonuses and combos. But as with the original, what really kills this is poor physics. The flippers don't respond in a logical fashion and the ball mechanics feel unrealistic despite the user having six to choose from. The 3D camera angles also hinder more than they reveal. With so much potential for Wiimote flipping and a more physical approach to the genre, Dream Pinball feels like a rushed and somewhat lazy conversion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
