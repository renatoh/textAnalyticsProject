Hip Portland and Oregon US If you loved San Francisco and Seattle, Portland may be your ideal next destination. It combines the alternative spirit of the former with the hip microbreweries, coffee shops and live music scene of the latter. The city is a laid-back but fast-growing place, tucked into the north-west corner of Oregon at the junction of the Willamette and Columbia Rivers. The busily rejuvenating downtown is where it all happens at night. People-watching with a beer or coffee is a popular pastime here. Don't miss the McMenamins Kennedy School. Once a real school, it is now a local hangout, with bars, a hotel and a cinema. Its Detention Bar is one of the town's most happening places to spend an evening. The cinema was the school auditorium. Hire a car and explore the rest of the state. Oregon has a huge diversity of natural attractions. The Columbia River Highway runs through mountain and forest before reaching a deep gorge that's one of the American North-West's great sights. Mount Hood is the base for winter and summer outdoor pursuits in the shadow of this dormant volcano. Crater Lake National Park is named after the deepest lake in the United States and Silver Falls National park is home to hiking trails looping round a series of impressive cascades. Getting to Portland is easy. It's a major air hub and is served by Amtrak trains, which head up and down the West coast and inland. Flights from the UK start at around \u00a3350. Contact America Coast-to-Coast (01732 592105) for reservations. Travel Oregon is a good starting point for planning. 17. Nuts for wildlife? The Pantanal, Brazil When people think of wildlife spotting in Brazil, they tend to think of the Amazon, but in fact the dense foliage makes it difficult to see much. Far better to head further south to the Pantanal, a vast alluvial plain half the size of France that is probably the continent's best ecotourism destination. The world's largest inland wetland is home to jaguars, pumas, anteaters, iguana, anaconda, jabiru stork and tens of millions of alligators. Conducted tours can be arranged on arrival. These are essential as there's little infrastructure in this huge swampy wilderness. When in the area, don't miss Bonito, home to a paradise of crystal clear springs and streams where snorkellers can float along through lush forest with hundreds of tropical fish for company. If wildlife isn't your thing, there's a big contrast further east, in Minas Gerais. This state, once rich in gold from the mines that gave the area its name, is packed with well-preserved towns with brilliantly painted churches and colonial buildings. Sabara, Ouro Petro, Diamantina and Sao Joao del Rei are close enough to be explored in a few days. Few have any buildings dating from later than the turn of the nineteenth century. The history and beautiful scenery make Minas Gerais a great alternative to the coastal hot spots of Rio and Salvador. A variety of tours are available from Audley Latin America (01869 276210). 18. Paralympic Games Athens The proud Greeks will have Athens spick and span for the thousands of visitors expected to attend the Olympic Games in August, but finding a place to bed down then will be a Herculean task. Schedule your visit for the Paralympics instead on 17-28 September, when it will be easier to see events, cooler and probably a lot more enjoyable. The Parthenon, atop the Acropolis, is the city's crowning glory, and is best appreciated in the evening with a stroll along the new walkway from Monastiraki to Thissio. The marble path is lined with hip bars and restaurants, but carnivores should wait until they reach To Steki tou Ilia for sublime charcoal-grilled lamb chops, Greek salad and tzatziki. To get a feel for just how old Athens is, check out the strata and archaeological gems along the walls of the Athens metro. Take a dip in the Saronic Gulf, have an ice cream with the locals in upmarket seaside suburb Glyfada, take day trips to Cape Sounio or the picture perfect island of Hydra. For inner city luxury chic stay at the St George Lycabettus Hotel. For more information on the Paralympics visit www.Athens2004.com or the Greek National Tourist Office (020 7495 9300). 19. Embrace the new The European Union From 1 May 2004 the European Union welcomes a host of new member countries, giving them a much bigger profile and promising easier travel to some exciting areas of Europe. The Mediterranean destinations of Malta and Cyprus will be well known but there's much more to explore. Dozens of small towns in the Czech Republic and Hungary rival the charms of Prague and Budapest, offering better value and fewer crowds. Poland's history is as remarkable as the mountains it shares with Slovakia. Slovenia has been growing in popularity as a hiking, skiing and city-break destination for some time. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania form a compact and fascinating cultural and natural region that's perfect for city breaks or longer wanderings. New routes are already opening up, with low-cost flights to Bratislava and Budapest with Sky Europe (020 7365 0365) and Warsaw with Air Polonia (00 48 22 575 00 00). Expect these to be the first of many. 20. Beyond the goalposts Portugal Football fans will be descending on Portugal from 12 June to 4 July for the Euro 2004 championships to see if Thierry Henry and his French teammates can retain their title. Lisbon, Faro, Leiria, Coimbra, Aveiro, Porto, Guimares and Braga are hosting matches, and each city will be polished and looking at its finest. England play all but one of their matches in the capital. Portugal is an ideal country to host a tournament like this. It's small enough to make getting around easy by train, bus or car, and the weather should be warm sunshine at this time of year. Most three to five-star hotel accommodation and many campsites, hostels, and guesthouses in the host cities have been block-reserved by the official accommodation agency (www.aa.euro2004.com) which you can book through to secure a room. Portugal is a beautiful country so make time to get away from the championships and see some more of it. Contact the Portuguese Tourist Office (020 7494 5720). 21. In search of the bizarre Britain Look again if you think you've really seen everything that makes Britain such a fun place to explore. Seeking out the slightly different and bizarre celebrations and festivals in Britain is fast becoming a popular pastime and part of our colourful hidden heritage. The International Toe Wrestling Championships in Wetton, Staffordshire, pull in big crowds and, no doubt, big toes. If attending or competing in the World Bog Snorkelling Championships at Llanwrtyd, Powys, on 30 August seems a bit too last-year, why not enter the World Mountain Bike Bog Snorkelling Championships at the same venue on Saturday 10 July? Contestants in both events must complete two lengths of a murky 55 metre trench, swimming with snorkel and flippers or by bike. A more ancient festival, but no less bizarre, is the Baal Fire, a procession through Allendale, Northumberland, of flaming tar barrels carried by 'guisers', local people who blacken their faces for the occasion on New Year's Eve. No one is sure whether its history lies in Viking or pagan times, but it's fascinating to watch. So whether you fancy chasing cheese down hills, racing sheep or hens, or competing to be the world's best gurner - a puller of odd faces - there's a fresh and barmy festival that's the perfect excuse to behave strangely. Visit Britain (020 8846 9000) has more information on these and other simple, eccentric pleasures. 22. Will Egypt slip to second place? Jordan Record numbers of tourists went to Egypt last year, completing its recovery from the slump of previous years. In 2004 it could be the turn of Jordan as those in search of smaller crowds and better deals look elsewhere. It isn't hard to see why. Petra is Jordan's amazing must-see attraction, but there's thousands of years of history to explore from the Roman remains at Jerash and the citadel in the capital, Amman, to crusader castles such as Karak and the traditional stone village of Dana. Jordan also has many natural attractions. The breathtaking desert landscapes of Wadi Rum compare with the world's best, Wadi Mujib's canyons are great for hiking and, whether you like your sea Red or Dead, there's somewhere to cool off. Aqaba is the picturesque gateway to excellent diving and snorkel-ling. If you add into this cocktail the warm welcome of the Jordanian people, the chance to eat some of the world's best hummus and falafel and the opportunity to see Jordan when it's quiet, this could be one of the best ever times to visit. Arabian Odyssey (01242 224482) offers eight day trips to the highlights of Jordan for \u00a3829 a head. 23. The wheel deal Britain More UK cycling paths than ever will be open in 2004 so now's the time to get out on two wheels. Leaving the car behind involves seeking out paths that take you away from cities and out into countryside where you're never far from a convenient pub or B&amp;B. Designed for this purpose, the National Cycle Network now covers 7,000 miles on quiet or traffic-free routes. Whether you're having a day out or a cycling holiday there's a route that matches your needs. High-profile rides include the Sea to Sea route from Workington in Cumbria to Newcastle upon Tyne and the Cornish Way from Land's End to Bude. Popular trails can get crowded especially at weekends or during holidays, but there are plenty of routes to choose from. There are many other ways to get involved. Sustrans, the sustainable transport charity behind the National Cycle Network, periodically requires volunteers to help clear paths for new cycleways such as the Ancient Stones Cycle Route, which is due to open in 2005. As well as the exercise, cycling is a cheap, sociable holiday for individuals and families. You can make up your itinerary as you go along, and pedalling will always show you a new side to familiar territory. 24. St Petersburg by sea Russia Beautiful St Petersburg becomes more accessible in 2004 with the opening of a new ferry service from Germany to the Russian city. The Silja Line will be operating a three-times weekly ferry service from Rostock in Germany. The journey takes nearly 40 hours and includes a short stop in Tallinn, Estonia. This route makes Russia more accessible for drivers as well as making the trip to St Petersburg as easy as a hop over the North Sea, a skip through northern Germany and a jump across the Baltic. See www.ctic.spb.ru for more details of the city. 25. Bouncing back after Sars Hong Kong China has recovered from any after-effects of Sars and looks set to become one of the most popular long-haul destinations of 2004. Hong Kong is well established as a stopover or gateway to the People's Republic. It's also a fun destination in its own right, particularly if you can time your visit to coincide with one of the many festivals and special events that occur throughout the year. The joys of the Rugby Sevens are well known, but for local pride and colour you can't beat the June Dragon Boat Festival, where duelling longboats race to the beat of heavy drums at various locations. Though you can watch the action from the riverside for free, all that exertion may make you want to get on the water yourself. Hong Kong has opportunities for sailing, windsurfing and kayaking as well as several good swimming beaches. At night, head for the bars of Central Hong Kong Island to hang out with the hip crowd. If you still haven't seen enough of modern Hong Kong, splash out on somewhere fashionable to stay. Try the tasteful, trendy rooms at the Ice House which start at around \u00a370 per night. The Hong Kong Tourism Board in London (020 7533 7100) can provide further information. 26. Return journey Bali The 2002 Bali bombings, in which more than 200 people died, have had a profound effect on the Indonesian island's tourism industry. The Foreign Office is still advising Britons against all non-essential travel to the region. Yet Bali is calm now and if it stays that way a wave of British visitors may be tempted to join the trickle of foreign tourists who have returned there this year. This depends on a number of factors including any alteration in the FO advice but the promise of value-for-money flight and accommodation packages means Bali still has the potential to be one of the hot destinations of 2004. If you want something more than scenery and sunshine, the island rewards any effort to go beyond the tourist experience. A few kilometres from the commercialised haunts are villages where people live in traditional houses and continue a timeless round of religious rituals and rice cultivation. Consider less traditional activities which will take you into the heart of the island. Surfing, diving and snorkelling are incredibly popular, and walking is a great way to explore the quiet side of Bali. You can walk from village to village along small tracks and between rice paddies: Amlapura in eastern Bali features a winding road which passes pretty villages, tall bamboos and beautiful distant sea views. The Bali Indonesia Travel Portal is the best source for travel information on Bali, and you can keep up to date with the latest advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (0870 606 0290). 27. French beach with a difference La Rochelle Whisking your loved one to Paris is a lovely, romantic gesture. Of late it's become increasingly good value so you may have to work a little harder to impress that special someone. If a little Gallic romance is in order, think about going a little further and making a weekend of it. Students of French may laugh at the mention of La Rochelle, immortalised as the holiday destination of choice in Tricolore textbooks, but the town is one of France's most attractive seaside destinations. Take the Friday afternoon Ryanair flight from Stansted and you can be exploring the Vieux Port in time for dinner. The town is lively and fashionable and has hundreds of places to eat. As you might expect, fish is on the menu most often. Try Le Comptoire des Voyages (00 33 5 46 50 62 60) which has a set menu for around \u00a325. It mixes global inspiration with local ingredients in a swish setting. Alternatively, take a stroll round the old town and ask at your hotel to get a flavour for where's hot to dine.Visit in summer to take advantage of the excellent beaches on the nearby Ile de R\u00e9. Stay in the historic Hotel Henri IV (00 33 5 46 41 25 79) in the pedestrianised old city from around \u00a350. Practise that French at www.larochelle-tourisme.com. 28. The new Glastonbury? Denmark The UK pop festival season is famous for great music, not so great toilets and either baking sun or mud baths. It's been getting harder to get tickets for Glastonbury, the jewel in the crown of the season. This year, rather than battle with always-busy phone lines or hours of angst on eBay trying to score a ticket, head abroad for some other dates on the festival calendar. The Roskilde festival in Denmark is one of the Continent's great music events, with an anarchic spirit, some of the world's best bands and hordes of music fans from all over Europe. It will be held on 1-4 July and tickets start at \u00a3100. Roskilde is near Copenhagen, and budget flights mean you'll probably get home a lot quicker than if you went to Glastonbury. 29. Lush, green Galicia Spain Galicia, in north-western Spain, is again welcoming visitors after the oil spill of November 2002. Its coast is dotted with traditional fishing villages, beaches and coves. The inlets on the west-facing coast, of which Rias Bajas is the most impressive, are home to such towns as Cambados and Pontevedra that have atmospheric old centres to explore. In summer, the Islas Cies offer the best natural scenery. The regional capital, the port of La Coru\u00c0a is vibrant and easy on the eye. It is home to the Torre de Hercules, a lighthouse built by the Romans. If you wander inland you will find classic rural scenery, green rolling hills and isolated farmhouses. The nearby provinces of Asturias and Cantabria offer more of the same, plus the Picos de Europa, which has some of Spain's most stunning mountain scenery. Go in spring to see the country at its blooming best. The Spanish Tourist Office (020 7486 8077) has plenty more on Espana Verde. 30. Paradise Sri Lanka After decades of civil war, peace has returned to this teardrop-shaped island in the Indian Ocean. Since a ceasefire between the government and the Tamil Tigers was agreed in February 2002 only limited areas in the north and east are out of bounds to tourists. The highlights? Drinking coconut milk from the shell on a palm-fringed beach, a night climb to Adam's Peak to see the sunrise, jungle safaris to spot elephant, monkeys and birds of paradise, snorkelling with sea turtles in the ocean, fresh papaya juice, Buddhist temples, ruined cities, curries which make your eyes water and the friendliest people anywhere, all wrapped in a small, perfectly formed package.
