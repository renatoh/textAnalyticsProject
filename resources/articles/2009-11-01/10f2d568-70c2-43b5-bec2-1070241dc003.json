South Africa's second team were taken apart by what was pretty much the Leicester academy last week and now their first team, having rocked up from the republic only two days earlier, were rocked back on their behinds by a fired-up France in this rugby hotbed. It was not until the 78th minute that France opened up a seven-point lead, when another annihilated South Africa scrum coughed up a simple penalty, but in truth they could have had at least a couple more tries before then with a little more composure and less excitement. But it is hard to contain oneself at the smell of Springbok blood. There is nothing they like more down here than a juicy plate of world champion and France were suitably ravenous against a listless Springbok team. They could have stamped their authority on things a lot earlier than they did but in the midst of a wild, swirling wind there was the usual mixture of Gallic brilliance and madness. Indeed, the madness seemed to be winning out to begin with. South Africa opened up a 10-point lead in the first half by, as usual, not doing very much at all. A penalty and a drop-goal from Morne Steyn in reply to Julien Dupuy's early penalty had them in the lead, before John Smit scored the game's first try after half an hour. William Servat threw long at a defensive line-out \u2013 five metres from his line in this wind, utter madness \u2013 and Smit could not believe his luck as he collected and scored virtually without obstacle. Then came the brilliance or the latest instalment of it. Fabien Barcella went charging through a hole and a sweeping French move was continued until Vincent Clerc finished in the corner to bring the score back to 13-8. Dupuy then slotted his second penalty to get France to within two points at half-time, with Steyn trooping off to the sin-bin for a trip on Clerc. France had the edge in the scrum in the first half but they really started to make Springbok eyes water in the second. Dupuy kicked his third penalty from the carnage of a scrum and France had a lead they would not relinquish. It became increasingly the France show. There was brilliance at times, multi-passing, omni-directional brilliance, but more satisfying still was the out-and-out ferocity throughout the French ranks, their every flourish, wallop and blunder roared on by the superb crowd. The blunders, though, denied them the second-half try that would have killed the game. South Africa, however, were most hurt by the way their national anthem was butchered before the game by what sounded like a bad pub singer. Pieter de Villiers, their coach, considered it an insult. \"I would just like to convey how annoyed we are that the French did not respect our national anthem,\" he said. Of more immediate concern was that his side could not summon a score in the second half at all. Already the world champions have a reputation to attend to. .
