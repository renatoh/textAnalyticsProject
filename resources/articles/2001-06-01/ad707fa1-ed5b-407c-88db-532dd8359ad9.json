The foundation created by his family endows a prestigious annual award for American singers and puts on gala-style concerts such as this one, the foundation's first such event in the UK. The format requires expensive artists, each trying graciously to upstage everyone else, performing a conveyor belt of arias. But here a film projection of Tucker himself singing Vesti la giubba ensured they all risked being thoroughly upstaged by a performer who's been dead for more than a quarter of a century. You can tell a lot about a singer from the way they walk on to a concert platform. Cecilia Bartoli tried hard to look as though she didn't know she was the big draw, glancing around delightedly as if surprised so many of us had turned up. She sang in only one number, the finale from Rossini's La Cenerentola. Her voice may have sounded a little small in comparison with the titans who preceded her, but she drips charm, and her semiquavers poured forth with pinpoint precision. She could probably have earned her ovation with far less effort. The evening opened with a rousing chorus from Aida, the trumpet tune now more often heard on the football terraces than in the opera house, before Russell Braun nearly brought the house down with his mischievous performance of Figaro's first aria from The Barber of Seville. David Daniels's Handel aria brought some of the evening's most beautiful singing, while Aprile Millo sang Giordano's La mamma morta with a voice of throbbing steel. Julius Rudel and the Philharmonia accompanied responsively. There were plenty of other highlights: Maureen O'Flynn's sweet-voiced Caro nome; Ferruccio Furlanetto sounding suitably Russian as Tchaikovsky's Gremin; Grace Bumbry, a diva of the old school, singing Massenet with composed passion; Alexandru Agache as Giordano's Andrea Ch\u00e9nier; Daniel Sumegi as Verdi's Attila. The most persuasive evidence of Tucker's legacy, though, came in the two Mozart numbers performed by this year's prizewinner, Christine Goerke. She has presence and intelligence, and we'll certainly be hearing more of her full-bodied, focused soprano."}, "isHosted": false}}}
