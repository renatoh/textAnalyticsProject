A disconsolate Strachan addressed the media late last year after back-to-back, heavy defeats in Trnava and London while clearly grasping for incentive to remain as Scotland\u2019s manager. Ten months on, after a run which Strachan himself probably did not see coming, Scotland will not care about having the hard part to come. The fact there is a part at all \u2013 the Scots will almost certainly earn a World Cup play-off spot with victories over Slovakia and Slovenia \u2013 is testimony to stark improvement. Just do not ask Strachan about his level of personal satisfaction. \u201cYou have to remember the worst thing in football is talking about yourself,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI can spend all night here talking about anyone else but not me. I find it difficult and I don\u2019t want to go into what my thoughts are, my thought process.\u201d Strachan\u2019s men have returned 10 points from a possible 12, a scenario that would have been better but for Harry Kane\u2019s late, late intervention in the 2-2 draw at Hampden in June. \u201cI would never have said this was impossible, but it was going to be hard,\u201d the manager said. \u201cBut they have shown they can deal with hard. That they can deal with pressure. It\u2019s not anything you do differently. You walk in there and you make sure you are the leader with your coaching staff. You make them feel comfortable about themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s not one talk \u2013 it\u2019s the whole thing. It\u2019s hard when you are losing games, trust me, it\u2019s hard. That\u2019s the time you are tested as a football player and as a manager and coach. I didn\u2019t call for a sports psychologist. We didn\u2019t start drinking more water. We were all right, we did the same things. Believe me. \u201cIt\u2019s pleasing now when you are looking at guys in the dressing room after and everyone is clapping and looking forward to the next game with each other. They are talking and giving each other a round of applause, so that\u2019s good. I\u2019m pleased watching them and the staff enjoying themselves.\u201d Strachan refused to discuss how close he came to resignation, particularly after the 3-0 defeat at Wembley last November. He held talks with the Scottish FA\u2019s board after that one. There were widespread calls for Strachan to be removed, which to his credit he didn\u2019t and doesn\u2019t object to. \u201cI can understand that, I don\u2019t have a problem with that,\u201d Strachan added. \u201cA lot of it I don\u2019t take any offence, as long as it\u2019s done in the right manner. I\u2019ve no problem with people questioning things \u2013 as long as it\u2019s in the right manner and not personal, that\u2019s fine. \u201cI like working with the players and I like my job. I also think: \u2018Right, where do we go? What\u2019s coming up? Who is progressing?\u2019 The young players give us real hope. \u201cI still count the England game as a good performance. I just think it was with a freak three headers that they won. I\u2019ve not seen England doing that ever since. Three free headers and them going in. If you take the game as a whole, you analyse it and think: \u2018That\u2019s what we wanted to do.\u2019 But we couldn\u2019t help these headers looping at the back post. \u201cSlovakia away was a strange game. We got to positions where we wanted to get and the final pass wasn\u2019t good enough. Nobody else will understand that. We get there, that\u2019s the plan, can we deliver it? No. The first hit at goal actually goes in the back of the net for them. \u201cI have to step back from that. Once you walk away from games, if there is nothing there, if there is no hope that\u2019s the time you go: \u2018Wow, that\u2019s it.\u2019\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
