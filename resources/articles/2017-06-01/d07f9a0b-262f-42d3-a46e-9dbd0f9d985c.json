In a case of life imitating art imitating life, films from Some Kind of Monster (which sat in on Metallica\u2019s group therapy sessions) to End of the Century (which chronicled the tragically bitter life and death of the Ramones) play like a reprise of the intra-band bickering so perfectly satirised in This Is Spinal Tap. As the credits roll on Spinal Tap, Marty DiBergi, played by the director, Rob Reiner, asks bass player Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer) whether playing rock\u2019n\u2019roll keeps you a child. I was reminded of this watching Descent into the Maelstrom, the story of Radio Birdman, as this brilliant, influential and notoriously volatile band squabble over their history and their legacy. For the uninitiated, a brief snapshot: formed in 1974, Sydney\u2019s Radio Birdman were, alongside Brisbane\u2019s Saints, Australia\u2019s first and most lasting contribution to the punk movement. Like the Saints, they had a brief and extremely turbulent existence, breaking up in in the UK in 1978 while making just their second album. Their massive influence saw them reform for the first time in 1996, only to almost immediately break up again. But, like Spinal Tap\u2019s David St Hubbins and Nigel Tufnel, guitarist Deniz Tek and singer Rob Younger keep getting back together, because there will always be a baying audience somewhere for them to play to. Both are intense, serious men and aside from stalwart keyboard player Pip Hoyle, few have been able to stick with them. But that volatility was key to the original six-piece band\u2019s combustible chemistry. If you are already a Radio Birdman tragic \u2013 and tragics will be the first in line to see Descent into the Maelstrom, directed by Jonathan Sequeira \u2013 you\u2019re unlikely to find out anything new here. There\u2019s no pre-1978 live footage you won\u2019t have seen already, and the story is familiar. It\u2019s held together over one hour and 50 minutes by interviews with the band and close associates; thankfully, no bigger stars are lined up to obediently sing their praises. Don\u2019t let this lack of new information put you off, though. What makes Descent into the Maelstrom work is the brutal honesty of the band members as the wheels fall off their so-called \u201cvan of hate\u201d, as the Kombi driving them around that ill-fated 1978 UK tour was dubbed. It wasn\u2019t the usual combination of drugs and booze that did them in: it was poverty, depression and poisonous internal dynamics. Visually, the lack of new footage is compensated for by hundreds of stills and delightful storyboard artwork by bass player Warwick Gilbert (of whom a gonzo reviewer once wrote \u201ca Warwick is something you light if you want to start a war\u201d). Given that Gilbert was the first to leave the band \u2013 twice! \u2013 his heavy involvement indicates that Birdman\u2019s music remains bigger than the egos that made it. Which brings us to the music itself. Deniz Tek was a native of Ann Arbor, Michigan, and he brought his first-hand experience of the Stooges and MC5 to Australia in 1972 (there\u2019s a photo of him as a teenager in aviator shades, right in front of the Five\u2019s Rob Tyner). Radio Birdman were combative, confrontational, hated by the musical establishment, and changed the lives of thousands who saw them perform. In their slipstream came hundreds of bands, dozens of whom became embedded in the Australian rock landscape: Midnight Oil, the Sunnyboys, the Hoodoo Gurus, the Lime Spiders, the Hard-Ons, Died Pretty, the Celibate Rifles, and on and on. Hoyle gets the last word, and it\u2019s a killer: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s an Australian sound to Radio Birdman. I think there\u2019s a Radio Birdman sound to Australia.\u201d He\u2019s right. And few of those bands, even on their best nights, could summon the heart-attack inducing excitement of Radio Birdman in full flight. (For proof, track down the double live album of the band at Paddington Town Hall in December 1977, their last performance in Australia before departing for England: it is, in this writer\u2019s opinion, the best live recording released by an Australian band.) As such, what started as a cult phenomenon has continued to attract generations of converts to the cause. Descent into the Maelstrom won\u2019t exactly be an eye-opener to the Birdman faithful but, along with the band\u2019s reissued box set of recordings, it\u2019s a documentary that will ensure their legacy remains: hewn in the living rock, as Nigel Tufnel once observed. \u2022 Descent into the Maelstrom is showing in select cinemas from 19 June. Radio Birdman are performing with Died Pretty for a double headline tour around Australia from 16 June"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
