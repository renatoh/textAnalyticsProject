So far it's been delicious. Already this afternoon we've seen Robert Griffin III make a sensational debut, opening his account with an 88-yard touchdown pass to Pierre Garcon and outperforming Drew Brees to put the Washington Redskins \u2013 at time of writing \u2013 on course for an incredible upset of the New Orleans Saints. Mark Sanchez and the New York Jets, meanwhile, have been making a statement of their own in dominating the much fancied Buffalo Bills. Now we move on to a match-up NFL fans have been waiting for ever since January. Green Bay and San Francisco were supposed to meet in the NFC Championship game eight months ago \u2013 the best two teams in the conference during the regular season. Instead the New York Giants awoke from a season-long slumber to knock off both teams in their own back yards before defeating New England at Super Bowl XLVI. If the stage here is not quite so grand, it will nevertheless be fascinating to see how each team begins the new season. Can Randy Moss, among the most athletically gifted wide receivers ever to play the game but coming off a one-year retirement, elevate a San Francisco offence whose main task last year was simply not to lose games that the defence could win on their own? Will an influx of youth provide a much-needed shot in the arm for Green Bay's defensive line? But just as was the case in January, the greatest intrigue will surround the match-up between one of the league's greatest offences and a similarly dominant D. Can San Francisco ends Justin and Aldon Smith bully Green Bay's offensive line as they have so many others? Will Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers find places to go that others couldn't against a defence that gave up just 14.3 points per game last year? It should be fun finding out. Daring to dream Such is the parity that exists in the NFL that all fans should feel entitled to dream at this time of year. Every season, without fail, we see teams who massively surpass expectations and others who fail to live up to them. With that in mind I ask the fans out there, what would be your most optimistic prediction for your team in the season ahead? And what about your realistic one? Meant to say in that last entry: You can email your predictions to me at pbliveblog@gmail.com, or tweet them over to @Paolo_Bandini. Update from the early games All of the following scorelines are now confirmed as final: St Louis Rams 23 Detroit Lions 27 Miami Dolphins 10 Houston Texans 30 Atlanta Falcons 40 Kansas City Chiefs 24 Jacksonville Jaguars 23 Minnesota Vikings 26 (after OT) New England Patriots 34 Tennessee Titans 13 Still playing, meanwhile, are: Indianapolis Colts 21 Chicago Bears 41 Philadelphia Eagles 10 Cleveland Browns 16 Washington Redskins 33 New Orleans Saints 25 Buffalo Bills 28 New York Jets 47 Oh dear That was an inauspicious start. I'm afraid tech issues locked me out of the system there for a few minutes just at the point where the game was kicking off. Anyway, back now and the good news is that you haven't missed any scoring. 49ers 0 Packers 0, 10:41 remaining in 1st quarter So here's where we're up to: Packers on offence after the Niners opened with a three-and-out. First and 10 at the San Francisco 42. 49ers 0 Packers 0, 9:11 remaining in 1st quarter The Packers' drive comes to an end with Aaron Rodgers getting clobbered by his nearly namesake Carlos Rogers at the halfway line - Green Bay leaving the defensive back unblocked on what was supposed to be a quick release play on third and 11. Kyle Williams steps up to allow the punt to go out for a touchback. Meantime, the season predictions are flooding in. 49ers fan @PRDH tweets: \"Optimistic Superbowl win, realistic Championship game.\" That's a pretty high low bar you just set ... 49ers 0 Packers 0, 6:00 remaining in 1st quarter San Francisco are moving now and guess who that is streaking down the left sideline for a 20-yard grab to the Packers' 28-yard line. Randy Moss didn't have to do anything special to reel that one in, but I am fascinated to see how he goes this year. There might never have been a player with quite the same combination of size, speed and body control as Moss had in his younger years. Field goal! 49ers 3 Packers 0, 4:53 remaining in 1st quarter The drive concludes with the Niners getting themselves on the board, courtesy of a 40-yard David Akers field goal. Charles Woodson had jarred the ball loose from Mario Manningham's hands on the play after the Moss reception, but it bobbled out of bounds. San Francisco did not manage another first down from there. 49ers 3 Packers 0, 4:53 remaining in 1st quarter The kick-off goes for another touchback. Meantime, Darren Brimer is still fuming about an incident during our tech freeze, when Aldon Smith was penalised for taking his helmet off following a sack of Rogers. \"That's it. I haven't got a mortgage, but I'm going to take one out and put it on the Packers coming out on top this season,\" he thunders by email. \"They really are the luckiest team. Fifteen yards for taking your helmet off, which was half off anyway 'cause Rodgers kicked it. And now a wasted challenge by SF, which they WILL wish hadn't used later in the half.\" 49ers 3 Packers 0, 2:57 remaining in 1st quarter Green Bay waste no time getting back up to midfield, Rodgers completing three quick passes in succession out of the no huddle before rolling out on a bootleg and running out of bounds for a first down at the 47. \"Oakland Raiders fan here,\" tweets @nomisknarf. \"Optimistic: 3rd place in the AFC West. Pessimistic: 4th place in the AFC West.\" 49ers 3 Packers 0, 1:57 remaining in 1st quarter Wow - what a play that was by Tarell Brown, the 49ers DB launching himself with immaculate timing to stretch out a hand and bat away a Rodgers bomb that seemed sure to finish up in the hands of James Jones just a few yards outside the endzone on the left. The ball was slightly underthrown and Jones was falling, so it likely wouldn't have gone for a score but Green Bay certainly wouldn't have been far out. Instead, two plays later, they send out Masthay to punt from the San Francisco 45. Kyle Williams makes the fair catch at the eight. End of 1st quarter: 49ers 3 Packers 0 Early days it may be, but so far defence&gt;offence. Meantime, @crashdavis2008 raises the pessimistic predictions bar further on Twitter: \"Vikings fan here - Optimism: 4th place in the NFC North. Realism: 4th place in the NFC North.\" And they won today, too. 49ers 3 Packers 0, 14:12 remaining in 2nd quarter Green Bay's turn to get angry with these replacement officials, as Clay Matthews is handed a 15-yard roughing the passer penalty. The official position would be that he left his feet after Smith had made his throw. \"McCarthy is pissed,\" tweets @PackerReport. \"Not mad. pissed\". First and 10 for San Francisco at their own 40. TOUCHDOWN! 49ers 10 Packers 0, 11:10 remaining in 2nd quarter It had to be, didn't it? Randy Moss comes up with his first touchdown reception as a 49er less than four minutes into the second quarter of his first game for the team. A simple case of blown coverage in the Green Bay secondary, the receiver left to take up position unchecked right in the middle of the endzone. Smith had no trouble delivering the ball right to him. 49ers 10 Packers 0, 11:10 remaining in 2nd quarter Another touchback from the kick-off. \"Browns fan here. My optimistic prediction is 4th place in the AFC North,\" writes Mark Elliott by email. \"Pessimistic: in a surprise move relegation from NFL introduced, Browns play in Lingerie League next season.\" In fairness, it would probably make for a more entertaining spectacle in Cleveland. 49ers 10 Packers 0, 10:34 remaining in 2nd quarter A statement throw from Rodgers to start the drive, looking Jordy Nelson's way for the first time all game and connecting with him on a 28-yard strike. Packers straight up to their own 48. 49ers 10 Packers 0, 9:02 remaining in 2nd quarter Rodgers takes a shot after San Francisco jump offside on first down at the Niners' 38-yard line, but misses on the long bomb to James Jones. First and five at the 33 now. 49ers 10 Packers 0, 7:33 remaining in 2nd quarter What looks like a big-time catch from James Jones running a fade down the right sideline is wiped off by an offensive pass interference penalty. Perfect call by the officials, too, Jones giving Culliver a very visible shove just as the ball was about to arrive. The fans at Lambeau Field disagree. 49ers 10 Packers 0, 5:21 remaining in 2nd quarter In spite of the penalty, the Packers keep rolling - Rodgers hitting Jermichael Finley for a fresh set of downs on third and 12, then two plays later flipping a short pass to Randall Cobb, who turns it up-field for another 12 yards down to the San Francisco nine. \"For my Browns, the Number 1 pick next year,\" tweets @CiaranMcMonagle, wading into the predictions conversation. \"Optimistic and realistic.\" 49ers 10 Packers 0, 4:47 remaining in 2nd quarter Very naughty from Perrish Cox, who treads on the ankle of Finley as the tight end lies in the endzone at the conclusion of a play. A brief kerfuffle ensues, but the more important news is that a pass interference call on the play will give Green Bay a fresh set of downs on the one. TOUCHDOWN! 49ers 10 Packers 7, 4:40 remaining in 2nd quarter Revenge for Finley, who has the ball delivered to him in the endzone by Rodgers on a short buttonhook. Somewhere in amongst the five penalties on that drive, Green Bay actually seem to have got into a groove. Rodgers so far is 14 of 17 for 124 yards. San Francisco need to generate more pressure up front. 49ers 10 Packers 7, 4:40 remaining in 2nd quarter We're four for four on kick-offs going for touchbacks so far. \"Not fuming at all,\" writes Darren Brimer in response to my comments on his earlier email. \"Packers fan here. Just recognise that the Pack can occasionally get 'home' decisions, even on the road, with the same regularity as, say, a restart is awarded to a GB Olympic rower or cyclist.\" Naughty. 49ers 10 Packers 7, 3:41 remaining in 2nd quarter I've noted Rodgers's numbers, so here's a nod to Smith too. Another completion to Moss at the San Francisco 42 means he's now 10 of 11 for 112 yards and, of course, that TD. Could Moss be the man to finally help Smith start to become the player San Francisco had in mind when they took him with the first overall pick in 2005? Or is this Green Bay secondary just rather bad. Hmm. Two minute warning: 49ers 10 Packers 7 We reach the TV time-out with San Francisco driving, looking at a second and seven on the Green Bay 45 when we return. In the meantime, if you'd like to see Randy Moss's first touchdown catch as a 49er, now you can. 49ers 10 Packers 7, 1:05 remaining in 2nd quarter San Francisco use their second time-out as they contemplate third and one at the Green Bay 25. \"What you think of all the bad calls/flags so far in the 49ers game?\" asks @AbdallaTaryam on Twitter. Rather than answer that question myself, I may as well hand you over to the league's former vice-president of officiating, and present Fox Sports analyst Mike Pereira (@MikePereira). \"Here's what I think of the officiating in Green Bay/San Francisco for first half,\" he tweets. \"Not too strong... at this point.\" Field goal! 49ers 13 Packers 7, 0:55 remaining in 2nd quarter San Francisco are unable to move the ball any further, but after another time-out David Akers belts a 43-yard kick through the posts. Time yet for Green Bay to respond? 49ers 13 Packers 7, 0:55 remaining in 2nd quarter Kick-off. Touchback. I can probably stop telling you about these, right? 49ers 13 Packers 7, 0:18 remaining in 2nd quarter There's that pressure I was talking about! Green Bay go three and out with Rodgers twice feeling obliged to throw the ball away after being flushed out of the pocket. Masthay's huge punt is returned 20 yards by Williams to the San Francisco 38, and suddenly it's the 49ers looking to add to their score before the half. WHAT A KICK THAT IS! 49ers 16 Packers 7, 0:00 remaining in 2nd quarter Blimey. A 63-yard field goal (yup) from David Akers - tying the NFL record for the longest in league history - gives San Francisco a nine-point advantage going into the half. Colin Kaepernick had picked up 17 yards for the Niners on the first play of the new drive, but Smith threw incomplete on each of the next two plays, and with two seconds left on the clock Jim Harbaugh decided to let Akers have a shot at it. He got a perfect connection, but the ball still clanged off the crossbar before hopping over. Half-time: 49ers 16 Packers 7 To confirm, that's the half. A pretty darn one it was too for San Francisco - who went three and out to open the game but scored on every subsequent drive. The Packers have been undermined by penalties, but their failure to add more than seven points so far is also a reflection on a San Francisco defence which just does not give up points easily. We all know Green Bay can put up points in bunches, but this is not where they wanted to be at this stage of the game. Kicking conundrum \"Which kick was the more impressive in your opinion, Akers 63-yard record equalling effort, or rookie Blair Walsh's 55-yarder to force overtime in Minnesota?\" asks Liam Offord by email. A good question - and both were certainly remarkable. Walsh's had an added element of pressure, with the game on the line, but 63 yards is 63 yards. There's a reason it's a record. 49ers 16 Packers 7, 14:54 remaining in 3rd quarter Off we go again and - hey, look - a kick-off return! Cobb takes it out of his endzone all the way to the ... erm ... Green Bay 21. Oh well. 49ers 16 Packers 7, 13:41 remaining in 3rd quarter Poor clock management obliges Green Bay to burn an early time-out as they prepare for a third-and-one at their 30-yard-line, Jordy Nelson having been pushed out of bounds there after a quick reception on the play before. Meanwhile, @crashdavis2008 notes that Akers was not the second ever to make a 63-yard field goal, as I mistakenly claimed before. \"3 x 63yd FGs in NFL history before today. Tom Dempsey, Jason Elam and Sebastian Janokowski,\" he tweets. 49ers 16 Packers 7, 13:25 remaining in 3rd quarter Rodgers overthrows Nelson as he goes looking for a home run on third-and-one, and the Packers have to punt. Masthay does a good job with that, at least, booming it down to the San Francisco 16 with plenty of hang-time, leaving Williams to make the fair catch. \"Harbaugh knows how!\" writes an enthusiastic Timothy Talbot by email. \"How to motivate, how to delegate, how to un-complicate! He has instilled a culture of responsibility and achievement in the 9ers, who have very quickly become one of the most efficient, disciplined, and consistently excellent teams in the entire league. Some coaches come from the College ranks and have a rough go of it,but not Jimmy Harbaugh! In only his 2nd year, he already has established himself as one of the best Head Coaches in the league. Just a wonderful tactician and superlative motivator, also possesses a very keen eye for new talent, as well as getting the most out of what he's already got on hand. Could not be happier w/ what he's done with the long time sad sack 9ers, now the (once again) mighty 9ers!\" 49ers 16 Packers 7, 10:48 remaining in 3rd quarter The 49ers are flying again here, requiring just three plays to cross halfway after Smith is sacked on the first play of the new series. After a short completion to Hunter, Smith hits Michael Crabtree for a 20-yard gain, then hands off to Frank Gore, who tears around the right side of the line for 21. Having previously questioned whether the Niners were generating enough push up front, I'd now have to turn that question to the Pack. Clay Matthews is getting no change out of left tackle Joe Staley, and nobody else seems to be picking up the slack. Touchdown? 49ers 16 Packers 7, 9:17 remaining in 3rd quarter The call on the field is a score for San Francisco, as Kendall Hunter bundles over the left-hand corner of the goal-line from nine yards out but this one is surely coming back. Replays suggest the running back had both stepped out of bounds at the two and then been down by contact before crossing into the endzone. We await the verdict from the replay booth. Call overturned. 49ers 16 Packers 7, 9:17 remaining in 3rd quarter The chief official rules that Hunter did indeed step out at the two. It will be second and goal from there for San Francisco. TOUCHDOWN! 49ers 23 Packers 7, 8:15 remaining in 3rd quarter This one will count, Smith zipping the ball into the hands of Vernon Davis from four yards out on third down after San Francisco had been pushed back by a false start. Davis, hilariously enough, attempts to spike the ball through the posts but fails to get enough clearance on his leap and winds up being rejected by the crossbar. The crowd jeer. This time, though, it may be that those who laugh last do not laugh loudest. 49ers 23 Packers 7, 8:10 remaining in 3rd quarter Cobb takes the ball out of his endzone again from the kick-off, and this time gets out to the 28. \"As a 'Skins fan I'd have taken a 8-8 season this yr given past yrs rubbish,\" tweets @markc999, joining in our predictions thread. \"Now... RGIII's taking us to the Superbowl!!!\" 49ers 23 Packers 7, 4:20 remaining in 3rd quarter The Packers just cannot get into a rhythm today - and though that is in great part a reflection on San Francisco's defensive performance, it is a straightforward mistake that kills this latest drive, with Finley dropping a ball he really should have caught just inside the 49ers half on third down. If San Francisco can score again on this next drive - and they have on the past five - it's going to be a long way back for Green Bay. 49ers 23 Packers 7, 2:43 remaining in 3rd quarter Oh dear. The crowd at Lambeau Field finally get something to cheer about as Smith is sacked by Woodson and Matthews to leave his team looking at second and 15 from their own 10-yard line, but on the very next play Frank Gore is allowed to turn the corner on the left and dash up the sideline for a 16-yard gain. Matthews had got great penetration once again, throwing Staley back into Gore's intended path, but despite taking such a detour he still found nobody waiting for him as he got to the outside. 49ers 23 Packers 7, 0:46 remaining in 3rd quarter At last Green Bay get their stop, Michael Crabtree wrapped up two yards short of the marker on third and five. For the first time since the Niners' first possession, Andy Lee comes on to punt - booting the ball down to the Green Bay 19, where Cobb calls for a fair catch. End of third quarter: 49ers 23 Packers 7 Rodgers finishes the half with completions to Cobb and James Jones, each good for a first down. His team will pick up at their own 48 when play resumes. 49ers 23 Packers 7, 14:08 remaining in 4th quarter Still nothing doing for Green Bay, Greg Jennings juggling and almost pulling in a low pass from Rodgers on third down before losing it just before Dashon Goldshon arrived with a brutal hit. Masthay's punt is fair caught at the 10 by Williams. Time is running out for last year's No1 seeds in the NFC. Touchdown? 49ers 23 Packers 7, 11:16 remaining in 4th quarter Could this be the jump-start Green Bay needed? Randall Cobb returns Lee's punt 62 yards for a score after the Niners go three and out. Initially it appears as though the play will be wiped off by a penalty flag, but the block in the back call is overturned Now, though, the play is under review - with the head official set to check that Cobb didn't step out of bounds on his way to the endzone. TOUCHDOWN! 49ers 23 Packers 15, 11:16 remaining in 4th quarter The ruling stands, and Green Bay cap it by making the two-point conversion. Suddenly, this is a one-score ballgame. While replays confirm that Cobb did not step out of bounds, the decision to wave off the flag was a questionable one. There were actually two incidents during the return that looked dubious, and Mike Pereira on Fox confirms that one of them - a block in the back by Terrell Manning - should have been penalised. 49ers 23 Packers 15, 11:16 remaining in 4th quarter Harbaugh is furious about the waving off of that flag, and with good reason - since it happened right in front of him. Throughout this game, these replacement officials have not covered themselves in glory. The kick-off goes for a touchback. \"This is a HELLA disheartening start to the Packers' season,\" tweets @maeve666 - possibly just before the Cobb touchdown. \"Are Rodgers' passes overthrown, or do his receivers underrun? Or maybe Rodgers and Cobb are going to wake up the Pack in the final quarter? Here's hoping.\" Rodgers has definitely overthrown a few today ... but Cobb has been everywhere. 49ers 23 Packers 15, 8:59 remaining in 4th quarter Harbaugh is getting no happier as he loses his second challenge of the game (the first was during our tech blackout), disputing the decision that Frank Gore was tackled short of the first-down marker on third and two from the 28. Lee's punt is downed by Cobb at the Green Bay 25. Interception! 49ers 23 Packers 15, 8:50 remaining in 4th quarter Oh. Just when it looked like the Packers were gaining some momentum, Rodgers throws his first interception of the season - firing the ball straight into the hands of Navarro Bowman, who he simply must not have seen. A terrible pass, and Bowman returns it to the Green Bay 23. TOUCHDOWN! 49ers 30 Packers 15, 8:41 remaining in 4th quarter All too easy for Frank Gore, who sprints around the right end of the line and into the endzone on the first play of the new series. San Francisco restore a 15 point advantage, and frankly that's a fair reflection of the gap between these two teams today. 49ers 30 Packers 15, 7:00 remaining in 4th quarter Another penalty - this time for holding - threatens to derail Green Bay's latest drive, but at last Rodgers manages to make something happen deep - leading James Jones away down the right sideline. The receiver is eventually pushed out of bounds by Bowman - but only after a 49-yard gain. Just like that, the Packers are in the red zone. TOUCHDOWN! 49ers 30 Packers 22, 6:03 remaining in 4th quarter Where did that come from? Rodgers hits Jones again on each of the next two plays, picking up nine and then 10 yards en route to the endzone. The quarterback was five for five on that drive. We know he's more than capable of these sorts of drives, but we really hadn't seen any evidence of it tonight until now. 49ers 30 Packers 22, 5:58 remaining in 4th quarter Kendall Hunter takes it out of his endzone to the 49ers' 26. 49ers 30 Packers 22, 3:45 remaining in 4th quarter The 49ers make quick progress to near midfield, Smith hitting Miller for a 15-yard gain up to their 46. But two plays later he is sacked for a big loss by Clay Matthews, and on third and long the quarterback opts to tuck the ball in and scramble for a short gain, rather than risk a shot downfield. Green Bay use up their last time-out to stop the clock. 49ers 30 Packers 22, 3:37 remaining in 4th quarter Cobb makes all of a yard back on the ensuing punt return, taking it out to the Green Bay 16. With no time-outs left, it's all or nothing time for the Packers. Two minute warning: 49ers 30 Packers 22 A slow start to the drive as Rodgers throws incomplete on first down then finds himself scrambling for a single yard on second. But on third he gets the ball to Cobb over the middle and just past the first-down marker. And that takes us to the two minute warning. Turnover on downs! 49ers 30 Packers 22, 0:49 remaining in 4th quarter Just as they have for most of the afternoon, San Francisco come up with the stop when they need it. Faced with fourth and 10 after one incompletion, a sack and then a quick hit over the middle to Cobb, Rodgers wound up for a big heave down the sideline to Nelson, but Culliver had perfect position on the receiver in man coverage and twisted in the air to knock the ball down. Alex Smith will kneel on the ball, and San Francisco are going to open the season with a win over the Packers at Lambeau Field. Final score: San Francisco 49ers 30 Green Bay Packers 22 Well, well, well - a fantastic start to the season for San Francisco, defeating the team who posted the best record in the NFC last season on their own field. The Niners appear improved on offence - with Smith far more than just a game manager as he and Randy Moss attacked this Green Bay defence in the first half - and on defence as stout as ever. The Packers, though, will have much soul-searching to do after beginning this season as they finished the last: with a defeat at Lambeau. Anyway, that's all from me for now.
