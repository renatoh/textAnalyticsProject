The family of Johana Medina Le\u00f3n, a 25-year-old asylum seeker from El Salvador who died this month, filed a civil rights claim against the US government this week, alleging that officials ignored her numerous requests for treatment as her health \u201crapidly deteriorated\u201d. Medina Le\u00f3n, who worked as a nurse in El Salvador, recognized that she needed IV fluids, but was denied. When she asked for water, sugar and salt so she could make her own IV, Ice also refused, the claim said. The treatment in Ice custody was so bad that Medina Le\u00f3n, who was fleeing violence in her home country, requested to be deported so she could get medical attention, lawyers said. That request was also denied. \u201cShe came to the US because she thought it was a great country and that she would be safe there,\u201d her 22-year-old sister, Gabriela Le\u00f3n, said in an email to the Guardian, sent by her lawyer. \u201cShe did everything right but was treated as a criminal \u2026 She shouldn\u2019t have died. She went to the US seeking protection and now she is coming home to us dead.\u201d Christopher Dolan, an attorney who filed the claim, added: \u201cShe was desperate, because the government would not provide her with assistance of any kind for her medical needs.\u201d The death of Medina Le\u00f3n, who was detained for more than a month despite following official procedures for seeking asylum and passing her first interview, comes at a time of escalating concerns about human rights violations in US immigration facilities. Queer and trans migrants are particularly vulnerable, suffering disproportionate rates of physical and sexual abuse behind bars and often being forced into solitary confinement. The legal claim of Medina Le\u00f3n\u2019s family, the first step in a formal lawsuit, was filed one year after Roxsana Hern\u00e1ndez, a trans Honduran woman, died in Ice custody due to dehydration and complications related to HIV. At least 24 immigrants have died in Ice detention during the Trump administration, and six migrant children have died in federal custody since September, most becoming ill in the US border patrol\u2019s crowded temporary holding areas. Medina Le\u00f3n was threatened with physical violence because she is a trans woman and fled El Salvador in December 2018, lawyers said. She was granted a humanitarian visa in Mexico and then presented herself to US authorities to request asylum. \u201cIn El Salvador, as a transgender person, she was unable to live her life in peace and without fear of violence,\u201d her sister said, adding that she had hoped in the US \u201cshe would be treated with dignity and respect living her life as her true self, a female\u201d. The only place she had family outside of El Salvador was the US. She was subsequently detained in El Paso, Texas, in April and transferred to the Otero county processing center in New Mexico. Like other trans women at the privately run detention center, she was housed with men. On 18 May, authorities determined she had \u201ccredible fear\u201d of persecution if forced to return to El Salvador, but Ice continued to detain her. She eventually became unconscious and was taken to a Texas hospital, her attorneys said. That same day, she was released on parole. Dolan, a San Francisco-based lawyer, accused Ice of finally releasing her when she became seriously ill in an effort to \u201cabsolve themselves of responsibility\u201d. Leticia Zamarripa, an Ice spokeswoman, declined to comment on the legal claim on Wednesday, but last week issued a statement saying Medina Le\u00f3n had been hospitalized due to chest pain and that her case was \u201creviewed\u201d that day, leading to her release from custody. The family had communicated with her regularly while she was in Otero, said Gabriela Le\u00f3n, saying her sister had gotten \u201csicker and sicker\u201d but had received no help: \u201cShe said she wanted to give up trying to get asylum and just be deported so she could get help \u2026 She just wanted to go home where she knew she might be attacked but she felt it would be better than dying in jail.\u201d On 1 June, they learned she had died of pneumonia. Ola Osaze, a national organizer with the Black LGBTQIA+ Migrant Project, said trans migrants were often denied asylum despite overwhelming evidence of the conditions they are fleeing: \u201cIt is cruel and unusual to detain us when we are seeking help. This is something that no government can justify \u2026 It is a form of torture and it needs to stop.\u201d At Otero, where Medina Le\u00f3n was held, trans detainees have complained of a range of challenges, including difficulties seeing a doctor, troubles accessing attorneys, guards who don\u2019t respect their gender, inadequate food and threats of solitary confinement, said Lynly Egyes, the litigation director of the Transgender Law Center. \u201cTrans people cannot be held safely in detention,\u201d she added. Last week, Ice claimed that detainees received \u201ccomprehensive medical care\u201d and had a \u201cfull health assessment\u201d within two weeks of entering Ice custody. Emilio Vicente, the communications manager with Familia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement, said Medina Le\u00f3n\u2019s request for deportation signaled just how horrific her treatment must have been: \u201cShe was in such a dire situation that she felt the only way for her to survive was going back \u2026 and even then, Ice didn\u2019t take any action to honor her request.\u201d Gabriela said she wanted people to remember her sister as \u201ca very good person, a kind person, a caring person who had dedicated her life to helping others as a nurse\u201d, adding: \u201cShe didn\u2019t need to die.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
