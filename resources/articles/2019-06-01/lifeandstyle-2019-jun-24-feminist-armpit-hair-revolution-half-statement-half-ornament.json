While watching the HBO show High Maintenance, I noticed that Lee, the protagonist\u2019s hip and beautiful love interest, was sporting hairy armpits. \u201cLook!\u201d I cried to my husband, as though I\u2019d unexpectedly spotted a T-shirt emblazoned with the name of my favorite obscure band. For the past couple of decades, I have seldom shaved my armpits. Now, all of a sudden, I was on-trend. Among both celebrities and the masses, female body hair is sprouting all over. Ilana of Broad City has exposed her underarm growth; so have Jemima Kirke and Zazie Beetz. In January of this year, Laura Jackson, a British college student, ran a campaign called \u201cJanuhairy,\u201d urging women to grow out their body hair and post selfies on Instagram. In some ways, this phenomenon harks back to the second wave movement of the 1960s and 1970s, when feminists began to challenge restrictive beauty standards. At a famous march outside the 1968 Miss America pageant in Atlantic City, protesters ceremoniously discarded their bras and stiletto heels; many feminists of that era also ditched their razors and tweezers. But today\u2019s renewed enthusiasm for female hirsuteness comes with a distinctly 21st-century twist. Unshaven women in 2019 often meet other criteria for traditional feminine beauty \u2013they have sculpted eyebrows, wear lipstick or sexy lingerie \u2013 while proudly displaying their armpit hair. If the ethos of the 70s was a refusal to spend time and effort on cosmetics, the more common approach today is for women to curate different elements of their appearance, remaining conventionally attractive while deploying body hair as a feminist fuck-you: half-statement, half-ornament. Enter Billie, a New York-based subscription service that sells \u201crazors built for womankind\u201d. In January, the company announced a $25m investment from Goldman Sachs and other backers. Since its launch in November 2017, Billie has positioned itself as explicitly feminist. It denounces the so-called \u201cpink tax\u201d (the documented premium women pay for personal care products) and offers a \u201cpink tax rebate\u201d (a coupon toward a purchase). The company also says it donates 1% of all revenue to \u201cwomen\u2019s causes around the world\u201d, including Every Mother Counts, a not-for-profit dedicated to global maternal health. Billie\u2019s most radical feminist move is to show, in its various promotional materials, women removing actual hair from their bodies: models dragging razors up shaggy, moistened legs. As the company\u2019s web copy notes, \u201cCommercials show women \u2018shaving\u2019 perfectly smooth, airbrushed legs. Strange, huh?\u201d In a move that is either generously self-undermining or shrewdly opportunistic (or both), Billie also runs Project Body Hair, an image library of hair in all sorts of places it\u2019s not supposed to be. One of Billie\u2019s models is Hale, a 19-year-old musician and student at Bard College. On Billie\u2019s website, Hale sits on the floor against a bed, wearing a frilled white tank top. She is smoothing the hair on her head back with arms raised, revealing undisturbed axillary fuzz. Hale hit puberty early, she told me, and her body hair was dark and noticeable. At one point, \u201cI shaved literally everything,\u201d she said. \u201cI shaved my whole stomach when I was in elementary school, because I didn\u2019t like my happy trail.\u201d But in high school, she began to question the hairlessness ideal, and realized that \u201chaving autonomy over my body didn\u2019t make me less attractive or less valuable\u201d. Now, she sometimes, but not always, removes hair from her legs and other body parts, but never from her armpits. Until recently she waxed her unibrow, but as it grows back, she\u2019s started to think it\u2019s \u201creally cute\u201d. Billie\u2019s branding strategy may come across as fishy \u2013 they do sell razors, after all. But it seems to fit right in with the emerging ethos around body hair: celebrating women\u2019s choices as a hodgepodge of individual decisions about how to adhere to or violate cultural norms. As Georgina Gooley, Billie\u2019s 33-year-old Australian-born co-founder, told me, \u201cIf you choose to shave, we have a great product for you. If you don\u2019t, we have other products as well.\u201d (The company also sells lotion and body wash.) With Project Body Hair, she says, \u201cWe weren\u2019t sending the message that shaving is an expectation. We were saying shaving is a choice.\u201d Two camps Back in the 1970s, the conversation sounded quite different. As Rebecca Herzig writes in her 2015 book Plucked: A History of Hair Removal, two camps emerged in the second wave movement. The very first full issue of Ms. Magazine, in July of 1972, featured an article titled Body Hair: The Last Frontier. It criticized the shaving norm as an \u201cembodiment of our culture\u2019s preoccupation with keeping women in a kind of state of innocence, and denying their visceral selves\u201d. The time, money and psychological energy required for depilation were oppressive. Hairlessness was also infantilizing \u2013 it made women look like prepubescent girls. The social norm suggested, not very subtly, that there was something inherently wrong, gross and dirty about women\u2019s bodies as they naturally were. But another faction of feminists, led by Betty Friedan, had a different take. Friedan believed the preoccupation with body hair was counterproductive. She considered these concerns a trivial distraction from more important issues, such as professional opportunities and subsidized childcare. She also thought they harmed the cause of feminism by casting feminists as hairy, ugly, man-hating weirdos. I came of age in the 1990s, a midway point of sorts. My two best friends and I stopped shaving in high school. For me, this decision was not explicitly about feminism, but about an allegiance to my idea of authenticity (not to mention my allegiance to laziness). It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t care how I looked; I wanted to look like I didn\u2019t care how I looked. I wanted to be attractive, but I did not want to invest effort or enlist artifice into making myself so. Any such measures, to my 16-year-old mind, would have been cheating. At the same time, I usually felt self-conscious about my body hair, and often wore pants or long skirts. Displaying smooth, bald legs would have felt like selling out, but I felt a different sort of discomfort displaying hairy ones. I envied one of my friends whose leg hair was fine and wispy. Mine was not. (Later I resumed shaving my legs.) Back then, in my recollection, body hair did not register much in the cultural conversation. The founders of Instagram were in middle school. Feminism was in something of a lull, with a few exceptions such as the Riot Grrrl scene. My favorite magazine, Sassy, did embrace feminism, but not in a way that involved challenging beauty norms very aggressively. As far as I recall, nary a patch of stubble could be found on the waifish bodies of their models. It\u2019s hard to say exactly when what Hale refers to as the new \u201cbody-hair movement\u201d emerged \u2013 she describes it as \u201cnon-boys taking up space and deciding that they\u2019re not going to adjust to the norms\u201d. But she remembers thinking something was afoot when dyed armpit hair became fashionable a few years ago. One of the pioneers of that micro-trend was Roxie Jane Hunt, a hairstylist in Seattle. Hunt, 35, shaved as a teenager, but, she says, \u201cI always hated the action of doing it. It felt like a big chore but also a little bit of violence against my own body.\u201d When her daughter was about two, she saw Hunt shaving and asked her why. \u201cI realized I didn\u2019t have a good enough answer,\u201d Hunt says. She grew out her armpit hair, and found it \u201cmuch more sexy and natural\u201d. In 2014, on a lark, she and a friend dyed their underarm hair \u201cethereal blue\u201d, and Hunt posted photos of the colorful pits on her blog. \u201cThe blogpost kind of went viral from there,\u201d she says. She described the attitude with which they approached the exercise as \u201csort of joy. It opened up a little more imagination.\u201d Many people have since posted pictures of their \u201cunicorn pits\u201d, dyed in all the colors of the rainbow. If body hair has historically been invisible \u2013 too shameful to even show in razor commercials \u2013 this aesthetic makes it ultra-visible. In that sense, it takes the pro-hair ethos to its extreme. But in another sense, this practice is the opposite of the \u201clet it all hang out\u201d approach: it is, after all, hard to think of a grooming choice less natural, less laissez-faire, than polychromatic armpit hair. The look is also highly social-mediagenic, destined for virality. And social media, for both dyed and virgin body hair, is obviously a key part of what makes this round of hair affirmation different from previous eras. Women are not only refusing to conceal their body hair; they\u2019re flaunting it. Reluctance to judge A long-running debate within feminism has been whether we should respect women\u2019s choices \u2013 even if they seem to result from oppression \u2013 or whether only certain \u201cliberated\u201d choices merit approval. The new body-hair acceptance advocates land squarely in the former territory. When I was growing up, a common catchphrase was \u201cI\u2019m not a feminist, but \u2026\u201d followed by some statement of support for feminist principles, such as equal pay. Now, much more common is something like the reverse: claiming the mantle of feminism no matter how un-feminist the position may seem. A theme that came through loudly in my conversations with young women was that we should judge nothing \u2013 except perhaps judgment itself. \u201cI think the 70s wave of feminism was outright rejecting femininity. We don\u2019t need makeup, we don\u2019t want to be housewives,\u201d said Ashley Armitage, a 25-year-old photographer who shot one of the Billie marketing campaigns. \u201cNow it\u2019s like, wait a second, you can be a feminist and a housewife. You can shave.\u201d Surveying this new world of body hair, I wondered: are women making these choices because they think body hair is feminine, or despite the fact that they don\u2019t think it\u2019s feminine? Is there ever tension between their aesthetic preferences and their values? Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the prevalent reluctance to judge, no one wanted to say that they didn\u2019t like any particular aesthetic choice. According to Gooley, the Billie co-founder, she found a range of attitudes in her focus groups and market research. Some women think \u201cit\u2019s a patriarchal view to force women to shave. Other women are like, \u2018I just think it\u2019s really cute. I like my underarm hair.\u2019\u201d Just as there\u2019s a mix of motives, there\u2019s also a series of decisions \u2013 not a one-time resolution to always shave everything or never shave anything. \u201cSo many people, maybe sometimes they\u2019ll shave, sometimes they\u2019ll grow their hair out,\u201d says Armitage. \u201cSometimes they\u2019ll shave their legs, sometimes they\u2019ll grow their armpit hair.\u201d Considering this reality, Billie\u2019s pitch starts to make a little more sense. So far, this is all sounding very kumbaya: the shaven and the waxed and the hairy and the semi-hairy all getting along famously, showering each other with love and likes in a judgment-free festival. There is some truth to that: this discourse is refreshingly peaceable. But of course, it\u2019s not all rainbows and unicorns. For all the love that the photos of body hair have generated, they have also, inevitably, attracted trolls. MaryV Benoit, another Billie model, told me about the comments on the campaign: \u201cSeventy percent of them would be, \u2018Oh, that is awesome.\u2019 Thirty percent would be these weird men that would be like, \u2018You girls need to shave.\u2019\u201d Some of the comments were nastier. And some came from women. Posting a picture of your hairy self online takes guts. You know that not everyone will approve, and some will let you know it. Merely going out in public with female body hair takes a different sort of courage. You\u2019re less likely to hear direct insults, but more likely to get funny looks, unmediated by a screen. Female hairiness is still far from mainstream. But the more people who brave the all-caps comments and the whispers and stares, the less shocking it becomes. This is how norms change. And one of the few real upsides of social media, in my view, is its power to accelerate that process of dismantling dubious norms \u2013 not, in this case, in order to replace the old one with a new, equally unforgiving one, but to challenge the need for any norm at all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
