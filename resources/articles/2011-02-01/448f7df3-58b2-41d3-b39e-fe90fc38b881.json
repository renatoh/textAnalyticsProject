On their UK tour, however, they have played safe with Beethoven and Brahms as main fare. As yet, neither their principal conductor, Columbian Andr\u00e9s Orozco-Estrada, nor their soloist, pianist Natasha Paremski, is very familiar. This injection of new blood created the interest at their Colston Hall performance. Initially, it was a frisson of disbelief at the opening bars of the overture that stirred the audience: not the expected Marriage of Figaro, but Weber's Oberon \u2013 though the dancing lilt and generous sweep of the phrasing augured well. Orozco-Estrada is Vienna-trained, and his handling of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony demonstrated those credentials: a rhythmic and disciplined approach, with a sure shaping that made the fast and furious finale the logical culmination of all that came before. By way of amends, the Mozart reappeared as an encore, now with an irrepressible energy \u2013 and getting a laugh, too. It is rare for women to tackle Brahms's titanic First Piano Concerto; this alone sets Paremski apart. Russian-born but a US resident since the age of eight, the 23-year-old's softly expressive tone gave no inkling of the forces she would unleash, embracing fearlessly the extremes of tenderness and fierce passion. She proved capable of powerful sounds in Brahms's massive chords and octaves, bringing a gripping force to the tumultuous coda of the first movement. Orozco-Estrada may have been too indulgent of her slow adagio, but her clear vision of the final rondo again underlined a real artist in the making."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
