But brand experts say the airline has made things even worse for itself with poor public relations. Its press office tonight admitted mistakes were made and that the BA brand took a blow from T5's descent into chaos. The new hub's opening got off to a smooth enough start in the early hours of Thursday and BA's media relations team focussed on setting up press interviews with its first woman captain flying in from Hong Kong as well as passengers who had been desperate to be the first arrivals at T5. Press officers shepherding around reporters were pleased with how the \"human interest\" angle was going as camera crews chatted to people like the man who flew in from Hong Kong and then jumped on the first flight out of T5 to Paris. An ebullient chief executive Willie Walsh also came out to greet customers at his shiny new terminal and he was in front of cameras in time for breakfast shows. \"Early on it was a success story,\" says BA head of corporate communications Julia Simpson, a former advisor to Tony Blair and the Home Office. It seemed the T5 trials were paying off and BA would cope with the 40,000 passengers expected that first day. Then the problems started. Staff were struggling to cross massive security queues to their posts, the car park was jamming up and passengers started complaining of baggage reclaim delays. BA had to cancel flights and bin baggage check-ins. The \u00a34.3bn terminal descended into chaos in the full glare of the world's media. But BA waited to issue any clear guidance to customers or the media. \"There were lots of small problems that individually would not have sunk the operation, but cumulatively they were beginning to cause a problem,\" admits Simpson. So why not react with a statement from Walsh? Simpson argues it was about not misleading the media on a fast-moving story. \"When you are in the eye of an operational strom, speedy and up-to-date facts are hard to come by,\" she says. Finally in the early evening, BA put its head of operations, not Walsh, in front of a camera crew to read out a prepared statement. Instead of taking questions, he ran off once the statement was complete. Another mistake, admits Simpson, but again down to the fact he had little up-to-date information to impart. The gap between disarray descending and a statement was \"inevitable\" but \"with hindsight he probably should have taken a couple of questions,\" she concedes. So after the happy start of smiley customers and crew with carefully prepared backstories enthusing to journalists about their joy at such a \"momentous occasion\", the BA press office today woke up to universally damning headlines. \"The brand has been damaged by this,\" says Simpson. But she believes today's mea culpa moment from Walsh was the best way to mitigate the damage. BA stayed away from the blame game and brand experts say that was indeed the best way to play it. John Holton at brand consultancy Figtree says in an age when consumers reward transparency over spin every time, Walsh's \"the buck stops with me\" comments were exactly the right thing to do. But up until then, BA handled the T5 launch \"appallingly\". \"What was amazing was how the promise was so divorced from the reality. I can't understand how they could think it would go so swimmingly,\" he says. \"Expectations could have been managed so much better.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
