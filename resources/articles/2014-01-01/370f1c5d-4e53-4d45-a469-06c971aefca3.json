The album has been unavailable for a decade, but is now rereleased on Williams' own label, along with 20 live tracks, 14 of them previously unreleased, from a concert in Holland in 1989. And it deserves to be heard again. It includes the rousing country rocker Passionate Kisses, later a hit for Mary Chapin Carpenter, the epic narrative The Night's Too Long, which echoes Springsteen at his best, the gently charming Like a Rose, and some impressive blues tracks, including Howlin' Wolf's I asked for Water (He Gave Me Gasoline). An Americana classic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
