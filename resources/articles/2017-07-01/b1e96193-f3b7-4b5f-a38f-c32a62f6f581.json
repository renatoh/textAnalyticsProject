If a foreign government, in this case Saudi Arabia\u2019s royal family, doesn\u2019t like the rules in London, the UK is happy to be flexible. For some, the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s proposed rewrite of the listing rules to woo state-backed companies is a fuss about nothing. Aramco is an enormous beast that will shower fees on bankers and lawyers, and maybe also burnish London\u2019s standing. It could easily float here under a so-called \u201cstandard\u201d listing if it wished. But, if the price of keeping it away from New York is a tweak to the definition of a prestige \u201cpremium\u201d listing, so be it. After all, it will be argued, nobody will be compelled to buy shares in this $1tn, or possibly $2tn, monster. If only 5% of Aramco\u2019s shares are made available to outsiders, the company won\u2019t qualify for inclusion in FTSE indices and tracker funds will have to stay away. The problem with this relaxed view is that the FCA\u2019s proposed change makes London look ridiculous. The definition of a \u201cpremium\u201d listing is well understood and was established by hard experience of how outside investors can be abused by a single controlling shareholder. Two conditions of a \u201cpremium\u201d listing are seen as fundamental protections. First, tight controls must apply when the company and the controlling shareholder are conducting deals with each other. Second, outside shareholders should get a say on the appointment of independent directors. The FCA\u2019s proposal, in essence, is that sovereign-controlled companies can ignore both conditions but still qualify for a premium listing. They\u2019ll have to follow the other premium rules, just not those two. The FCA\u2019s thin justification is that \u201csovereign owners tend to be different from private sector individuals or entities in both their motivations and their nature\u201d. Is that really true, though? Some will be different, some won\u2019t, and it\u2019s hard to know in advance. That is the point of applying rules across the board. The current set-up works perfectly well and is popular. Whatever the FCA says about adapting and updating markets, this exercise seems to be driven by short-term considerations: get Aramco through the door, and worry later about the long-term hit to London\u2019s status as a high-class financial centre. Politicians, obsessed by Brexit, will cheer if the Saudis do indeed choose London. The rest of us should deplore a grubby little arrangement. AstraZeneca \u2013 a Soriot state of affairs Come on, Pascal Soriot, don\u2019t be shy. Are you staying or going as chief executive of AstraZeneca? It is astonishing that Soriot and his employer left this question hanging in the air all day on Thursday. Israeli newspaper Calcalist reported on Wednesday that Soriot is about to quit to join Israeli outfit Teva Pharmaceuticals and seemed confident about the details of his new remuneration package, down to the signing-on fee of $20m. The stock market thought, or feared, there\u2019s something in the tale. AstraZeneca\u2019s share price fell 3.5%, a mighty move for a firm worth \u00a365bn. Soriot\u2019s silence didn\u2019t help. If the tale is rubbish, it would be easy for the company to knock it down without breaching its pedantic policy of never commenting on rumours. At this stage, all that can reasonably be said is that Soriot\u2019s departure would be extraordinary. At AstraZenca, he\u2019s running one of the world\u2019s finest pharmaceutical companies with a multibillion-pound budget to pursue pioneering research and development. Teva is half the size and most of its business is concentrated in copycat generic medicines, which are surely less interesting for a rounded individual such as Soriot who is genuinely in love with science. AstraZeneca has also showered him with riches. Last year his package was worth \u00a313m, which ought to be enough to secure his loyalty. Then there\u2019s the fact that 2017 is supposed to be the pivotal year for AstraZeneca. The results of a critical trial on a potential blockbuster lung cancer treatment are due soon, setting the stage for the company to prove it was right to reject Pfizer\u2019s takeover bid in 2014 and back its long-term standalone prospects. For all those reasons, Soriot is probably staying put. But the shareholders \u2013 and, more importantly, his colleagues \u2013 deserve to be told. This is not a sensitive takeover situation. You are allowed to apply common sense and speak. The odd value in RBS Good news: the National Audit Office says the Treasury\u2019s sale of \u00a32.1bn worth of shares in Royal Bank of Scotland in 2015 was \u201cwell planned and organised and represented value for money\u201d. The last virtue is almost unarguable, since the Treasury bagged 330p a share versus RBS\u2019 current share price of 257p. With the benefit of hindsight, one wishes the chancellor had flogged a few more. There\u2019s one oddity in the report, however. It is how UKFI and its advisers, Goldman Sachs and Rothschild, established the \u201cfair value\u201d range for RBS shares. The process would not have been straightforward, since the bank faced so many litigation, conduct and regulatory issues. A view had to be taken on all, and a conservative bias then applied. Even against that confusing backdrop, however, the valuation range was remarkably wide \u2013 between 177p and 488p per share. That\u2019s not useful advice. It sounds more like well-paid advisers covering their backs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
