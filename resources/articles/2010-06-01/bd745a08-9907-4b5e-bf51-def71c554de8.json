A running theme of the Lib-Con coalition has been that, in the historic round of spending cuts and tax rises to come, the pain will be shared fairly. Tomorrow's budget gives the government a chance to show what that promise is worth. But how should we judge the fairness of the budget? Two big points must be made at the outset, on the timing and the broad outline of any fiscal restraint. First, it is obviously bad economics and unfair to slash spending or jack up taxes at a time when the UK and the world economy still has one foot in recession. There is a real danger of a repeat of 1937, the year that policymakers decided the slump was over and began tightening the screws \u2013 only to send the economy back into depression. Barack Obama was spot on in his warning to international leaders last Friday that \"we must ... learn from the consequential mistakes of the past when stimulus was too quickly withdrawn\". This debate is not about airy economic concepts; it involves the loss of jobs and the destruction of businesses. On its first swing of the axe \u2013 the \u00a36bn of cuts announced in May \u2013 the new government shredded the Future Jobs Fund, an excellent Labour initiative to help young people into work. The result of that and other moves, estimates eminent labour economist Danny [David] Blanchflower, will be to sling another quarter of a million young people on the dole queue by this time next year. The private sector is far too beleaguered to hire them. Timing aside, a chancellor committed to reducing borrowing as fairly as possible would consider all the options available: extending the period over which the deficit is to be cut (whatever Mr Osborne says, the Treasury won't turn into a pumpkin if it works to an eight-year timeframe, rather than five), cutting spending, raising tax, stimulating growth and a smidgen of inflation. Most governments only get out of a hole this large by pulling all these levers; yet the Conservatives \u2013 out of a dogmatic insistence that the state is too big (without providing a means by which \"too big\" might be measured) \u2013 harp on about spending cuts. The Tories campaigned in this election to bring down borrowing by \u00a34 of cuts for every \u00a31 of higher taxes, while the fairer Lib Dem austerity plan involved \u00a32.50 of cuts for \u00a31 of tax rises. The Lib Dem promise has been a casualty of the coalition, but the party was on the right side of the argument: cuts in public services hurt those at the bottom of the pile first and most. If \"progressive austerity\" is to amount to anything more than a hollow phrase, tax rises on those best able to bear them must take precedence over slashing the welfare state. We could begin by lifting income tax. As the Progressive Economics Panel reminds us in a paper today, a 3p rise on basic and higher rate taxpayers would bring in \u00a315bn a year. That would go a long way to plugging the deficit \u2013 and Mr Osborne could promise it is only temporary. But this lot are not likely to go in for such fair measures. Instead, prepare yourself for yet another raid on benefit payments (as if New Labour had not done enough of that already) \u2013 and for VAT to go up to 20%, starting in the January sales. Both measures will hurt the poorest most, and Mr Osborne should compensate them for the VAT rise with increased benefits. The other big test will be whether he brings capital gains tax up from 18% to 40%. A levy paid by the richest and used by many to dodge the higher income taxes, the new chancellor must close this loophole \u2013 no ifs, no buts, no fudge. Finally, he should bring in a meaningful levy on the banks, and commit to work with other European governments on an international tax on financial transactions. Mr Osborne can show tomorrow that he is more than a public-spending axeman. The big question is whether he will take that chance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
