Ri Thae Song, the deputy foreign minister, said in a statement translated on the state news agency that the \u201cyear-end time limit\u201d set for the US was \u201cdrawing nearer\u201d and accused the Trump administration of playing for time in discussions with Pyongyang, in the hope of avoiding a standoff before US presidential elections in November. \u201cThe dialogue touted by the US is, in essence, nothing but a foolish trick hatched to keep the DPRK [North Korea] bound to dialogue and use it in favour of the political situation and election in the US,\u201d Ri said. Joshua Pollack, the editor of the Nonproliferation Review, pointed out that Pyongyang has used the threat of a \u201cgift\u201d before, to refer to its first test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in 2017. He said that Pyongyang also warned the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, that he could face \u201ca real ballistic missile in the not distant future and under his nose\u201d. \u201cThey might not necessarily wait until the end of the year to show their displeasure on how the diplomacy with the United States has gone,\u201d Pollack, a senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see an ICBM go over Japan on Christmas Day itself.\u201d Donald Trump is touting his summit diplomacy with Kim Jong-un as one of his signature foreign policy achievements. He points in particular to North Korea\u2019s moratorium on testing nuclear warheads and ICBMs. An ICBM test over the holiday season would represent a significant blow as his re-election campaign moves into higher gear. Speaking in London, where he is attending a Nato meeting, Trump played down the security concerns over the North Korean nuclear and missile programmes. When a journalist put it to him that Kim continued to developed both programmes, the president replied \u201cYou don\u2019t know that\u201d, even though it reflects the US intelligence consensus. However, Trump did acknowledge that Kim had staged a series of short- and medium-range missile tests. \u201cHe definitely likes sending rockets up, doesn\u2019t he? That\u2019s why I call him Rocket Man,\u201d Trump said. He added: \u201cNow we have the most powerful military we\u2019ve ever had and we\u2019re by far the most powerful country in the world. And, hopefully, we don\u2019t have to use it, but if we do, we\u2019ll use it.\u201d Trump said that at their first summit meeting in Singapore in June 2017, Kim had promised to \u201cdenuclearize\u201d. \u201cI hope he lives up to the agreement, but we\u2019re going to find out,\u201d the president said. In fact the Singapore agreement said \u201cthe DPRK commits to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\u201d. To North Korea, the denuclearization of the peninsula, signifies a gradual process of mutual disarmament that also involves the withdrawal of US strategic weapons from the region. The difference in interpretations was papered over until the second summit in Hanoi in February 2018. The talks fell apart when Trump presented a plan requiring the wholesale dismantling of the North Korean nuclear and missile programmes in return for comprehensive sanctions relief. Kim wanted a step-by-step process. Since the collapse of the Hanoi talks, Kim and his regime have issued repeated threats that North Korea could resume nuclear or ICBM testing if the US did not make more concessions or demand less of Pyongyang. In his remarks in London, Trump hinted at possible concessions over its military deployment in South Korea, saying \u201cit can be debated\u201d whether the troop presence there was in US national security interests. \u201cI can go either way,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
