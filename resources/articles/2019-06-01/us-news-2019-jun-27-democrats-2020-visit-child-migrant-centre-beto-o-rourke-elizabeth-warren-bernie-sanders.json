No fewer than 12 of the 20 candidates who are appearing at the NBC News debates in Miami this week are making their way to the same spot that has become the current must-do photo op for the presidential hopefuls. The setting is an immigration detention center for child migrants in Homestead, 30 miles south of Miami. Here, in a scrubby bit of wasteland, a city of white tents houses up to 3,000 child migrants in conditions that protesters say are far from humane. And it is here that the Democratic presidential candidates have been landing like bees to the hive. On Monday it was Eric Swalwell, the congressman from California. On Wednesday, it was Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, US senators for Massachusetts and Minnesota, respectively. On Thursday, New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, snuck in before many of the local and national media had assembled. His luck or loss, depending. The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders pitched up at the entrance to the facility shortly after 10am. The moment he stepped out of his SUV he was entirely engulfed in a tight ball of microphone booms and TV cameras. Being Sanders, none of the kerfuffle distracted him from blasting out his talking points. Enemy No 1: the private for-profit company Caliburn, on whose board of advisers sits Donald Trump\u2019s former chief of staff John Kelly. The corporation \u201ccares for\u201d the migrant children at a reputed $750 each a day \u2013 giving it a cool turnover for just this one facility of close to $1bn a year. \u201cCorporations should not be making money by imprisoning children,\u201d Sanders thundered, his white hair glistening at the center of his media ball. Sanders spoke, looked over the chain-link perimeter fence as orange-hatted child detainees were led in single file between the tents, requested entry to the facility, was denied and then left. It was precisely the same routine repeated by all the presidential candidates who came before and after him. Next up, arriving 23 minutes after Sanders had departed was Beto O\u2019Rourke, fresh from his performance at the first bout of Democratic debates on Wednesday night. O\u2019Rourke repeated one of the most memorable aspects of his debate appearance \u2013 he broke into spontaneous Spanish. Standing atop a ladder better to view the child detainees on the other side of the fence, he began calling out to them. \u201c\u00a1Los vemos! \u00a1Los queremos! \u00a1Estamos aqu\u00ed con ustedes!\u201d he shouted, the veins on his neck distending with an effort to project. \u201cWe see you! We love you! We are here with you!\u201d O\u2019Rourke invoked Robert Kennedy, a heroic figure with whom O\u2019Rourke was once frequently compared until his polls tanked and his star waned. Kennedy said, O\u2019Rourke reminded us, that to be an American was to be a stranger, an outcast, and to be given a home in an exile\u2019s land. That America, O\u2019Rourke said, was in grave danger under Donald Trump. \u201cIf we allow this to continue,\u201d he said, gazing over the fence at the line of children, \u201cwe will change America forever. Every day this persists, I know that it\u2019s fundamentally changing.\u201d Some of the candidates have turned up at Homestead with at the head of mini-delegations. Warren arrived at the facility on Wednesday with two busloads of Miami-based supporters as her entourage. She too followed the routine, mounting a ladder as local protesters held letters aloft spelling \u201cShut it down\u201d and waved banners saying \u201cClose the camps\u201d. One activist managed to switch the faded baseball cap that Warren had been wearing with an orange cap like those of the detainees. It bore the logo \u201cHome Instead\u201d. \u201cThe character of our nation is not the character of the president,\u201d she said. By the end of this week Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana; Juli\u00e1n Castro, former federal housing secretary; the New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand; the California senator Kamala Harris; John Hickenlooper, former governor of Colorado; and bestselling author and spiritual healer Marianne Williamson will all have done the exact same routine, posed for the same photo ops and said many of the same things."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
