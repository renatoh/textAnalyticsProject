Pint-sized vocalist Eamon Hamilton was once in British Sea Power. Guitarist Tom White and his brother Alex, the drummer, moonlight in Electric Soft Parade. Bassist Marc Beatty has a separate life in Tenderfoot. So it comes as no surprise that they rifle through musical styles like a drunk ordering in a curry house. They start off with a pop-punk rumble, the Clash-meets-Modern-Lovers track Hold Me in the River. Last year's All Night Disco Party - which features sirens and is warmly dedicated by Hamilton to \"Saturday night in Leeds\" - is a disco stomper with echoes of the Rapture. Songs can last several minutes or, literally, several seconds. A similar half-demented duality informs their lyrics. This is a band who are not afraid to lay into the Iraq war or, mystifyingly, hurl a pineapple into the audience. You can't help but wonder who the typical Brakes fan is, and whether he or she should seek medical attention. However, Brakes' followers are nothing if not observant. When one shouts, \"Play Shiny Happy People\", he suddenly draws attention to the dome-headed Hamilton's resemblance to REM's Michael Stipe. This may explain why Brakes avoid the songs in their canon that sound even remotely like REM - which is a shame, because a similar Byrdsy jangle is by far the band's strongest suit. Unfortunately, this means there is no place for the sublime Mobile Communication, from their new album, Beatific Visions. But at some point, a bullet will have to be bitten. If Hamilton really is that sensitive to comparisons with his doppelganger, he could always stick that pineapple on his head. \u00b7 At King's College, London WC2 (0870 380 0017), tonight. Then touring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
