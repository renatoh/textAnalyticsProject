The veteran Tory, who has served in five cabinet roles including home secretary and chancellor, made disobliging comments about each of the candidates in turn after giving a television interview to Sky. He was recorded as he had a conversation with Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the former foreign secretary, apparently unaware that the camera was rolling. In the clip, Clarke was encouraged to share his views by Rifkind, who said: \u201cI don\u2019t mind who wins as long as Gove comes third. As long as Gove doesn\u2019t come in the final two I don\u2019t mind what happens.\u201d Clarke replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think the membership will vote for Gove. I remember being in a discussion about something to do with somewhere like Syria or Iraq and he was so wild that I remember exchanging looks with Liam Fox, who is much more rightwing than me. \u201cWe were exchanging views and Liam was raising eyebrows. I think with Michael as prime minister we\u2019d go to war with at least three countries at once.\u201d He added: \u201cHe did us all a favour by getting rid of Boris. The idea of Boris as prime minister is ridiculous.\u201d Clarke went on to claim that neither Andrea Leadsom nor Boris Johnson really wanted to leave the European Union. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think they even cared very much either way,\u201d Rifkind replied. Clarke continued: \u201cShe is not one of the tiny band of lunatics who think we can have a sort of glorious economic future outside the single market ... So long as she understands that she\u2019s not to deliver on some of the extremely stupid things she\u2019s been saying.\u201d He revealed that he might vote for Stephen Crabb tactically in the first round before backing May but said she was not an easy person to have as a colleague. \u201cTheresa is a bloody difficult woman, but you and I worked with Margaret Thatcher,\u201d he said, as both men burst out laughing. \u201cI get on all right with her and she is good. She\u2019s too narrow on her department ... She\u2019s been at the Home Office far too long, so I only know in detail what her views are on the Home Office. She doesn\u2019t know much about foreign affairs.\u201d Friends of Clarke later revealed he had been strongly encouraged by staff in his office to complain about Sky News broadcasting his comments. But the former chancellor resisted, saying he had only said what he really thought. Rifkind, who was also heard speaking about Gove, later told PA: \u201cMy comments speak for themselves, and they appear to be shared by quite a high proportion of the human race.\u201d David Cameron\u2019s spokeswoman was later asked whether the prime minister also finds May a \u201cbloody difficult woman\u201d. \u201cNo, she\u2019s done a very good job as home secretary,\u201d the official said. Clarke\u2019s remarks about May caused a storm on social media, with many people tweeting positively about the label under the hashtag of #BloodyDifficultWoman. Guy Opperman, a Tory MP supporting her leadership bid, said: \u201cI worked for Theresa May for 3 yrs in Home Office. Tough, kind, hardworking + yes sometimes a #BloodyDifficultWoman but would be a top PM.\u201d Many female Twitter users expressed pride at being \u201cbloody difficult women\u201d themselves, suggesting it is unlikely to have done May\u2019s campaign to be Conservative leader and prime minister much harm. Clarke\u2019s remarks were made public by Sky News as Conservative MPs took part in a secret ballot for the first round of voting in their leadership contest, which saw May take a commanding lead among MPs, with Fox eliminated and Crabb withdrawing. Clarke has already announced that he will step down at the next election. The 75-year-old is one of Westminster\u2019s three longest-serving MPs, having entered parliament with the Labour MPs Sir Gerald Kaufman and Dennis Skinner in the 1970 election. He has a reputation for plain-speaking and has frequently clashed with Eurosceptic colleagues because of his strongly pro-EU views. Clarke unsuccessfully ran to be Conservative leader himself on three occasions \u2013 in 1997, 2001 and 2005 \u2013 and has served in the cabinets of the past three Conservative prime ministers: Cameron, Sir John Major and Margaret Thatcher."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
