Downer EDI, a major infrastructure and integrated services company, gave the Ed Sheeran tickets to the director general of Department of Transport and Main Roads (TMS), Neil Scales, in March last year. There is no suggestion that the gifts influenced the department\u2019s procurement decisions in any way, or that they actually affected Scales\u2019s impartiality. TMS said in a statement that the director general was not the person who signed the Downer contracts. \u201cContract decisions, including those listed, are made by authorised TMR officers,\u201d the department said. The company is frequently contracted for work by the Queensland government. Later in 2018, Downer was awarded more than $10m in road resurfacing contracts from TMS, including in three limited tenders, and tens of millions of dollars worth of train upgrade contracts with Queensland Rail, a separate agency. It was also later awarded the $335.7m contract to fix the hugely controversial faults in Queensland\u2019s new train fleet, known as the new generation rollingstock (NGR), though the company had earlier been earmarked for the work in the state election campaign 2017. The tickets for an Ed Sheeran concert in Brisbane in March were declared on the department\u2019s gift register, as required. The justification for accepting the tickets was listed as \u201cto maintain relationship with external stakeholder and discuss the Inland Rail and NGR\u201d. \u201cStrong controls and checks are built into these processes to ensure procurement decisions are accountable, transparent and fair.\u201d Strict rules oversee public servants\u2019 acceptance of gifts across federal and state governments. Public servants are generally told not to accept gifts and benefits that could affect, or could be seen to affect, their impartiality. In Queensland, procurement guidelines warn \u201cpublic officials involved in any aspect of a procurement process are strongly advised not to accept gifts or benefits, as they can or may be seen to be, a means of influence\u201d. A 2010 directive from Queensland\u2019s public service commission states that public servants must be seen to act with integrity and impartiality, making the acceptance of some gifts inappropriate. \u201cConsequently, it is not appropriate for public service employees to be offered, to accept or to give gifts and benefits that affect, may be likely to affect or could reasonably be perceived to affect, the independent and impartial performance of their official duties.\u201d TMR said the acceptance of the tickets complied with the rules, and that its gifts management process met the requirements of the 2009 public service commission directive. \u201cTMR maintains robust processes in line with the Queensland procurement policy,\u201d the department said. \u201cIn relation to the Downer EDI gift, the declaration by the director general has satisfied the requirements of both the PSC directive and the TMR gifts and benefits policy.\u201d Downer EDI has also donated significant amounts to Queensland Labor. Last week, it made a donation of $17,080 to the state branch of the party, according to the donation disclosure system. In 2018, it donated $11,000 and $5,500 in June and January respectively. Downer EDI declined to comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
