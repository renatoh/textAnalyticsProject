So when it comes down to plastics in the workplace, your attitude should be as trenchant. Annually, the UK produces around 25m tonnes of commercial waste, a significant proportion of which is plastics, says Envirowise, a government-funded programme that advises businesses on sustainability. To reduce your office's polymer footprint, start with two easy targets: the pen and the cup. For the former, ask the gatekeeper of the stationery cupboard how many disposable plastic ballpoint pens you and your greedy colleagues get through. You'll be surprised. It's not just because everyone takes them home by mistake - most end up in company dustbins. That established, the first thing is to stop all new orders. Then seek out suppliers of pens made from recycled plastic or pens that can be sent back to the manufacturers to be recycled once the ink has run out, or both. Go further and opt for refillables - just make sure the ink cartridges are recyclable too. Go even further and stop ordering in pens altogether for the next few months. Cutting off the supply will lead to pen monogamy in the office. On to the next plastic target. Good news: the cups at the watercooler are recyclable. Bad news: few of us stick to one cup all day, let alone all week. Think it might be difficult to re-educate people into reusing their cup? Ban the plastic version, and people will start using their own glasses. What about polystyrene foam cups? Though made from same polymer as the water cups, they are more difficult to recycle. One of the reasons is that the blowing agents used to expand the polystyrene vary from one manufacturer to another and are not compatible when being reprocessed, says the recycling firm Save A Cup. The only option is outlawing such cups. How hard is it to bring your own mug into work anyway? Use it every time the tea trolley comes. Take it with you to the canteen or to whatever coffee joint you frequent on your way to work. You'll be glad to hear that your boss will welcome these moves . This is because an EU directive came into force last Tuesday requiring that all UK businesses treat their non-hazardous waste before it can be landfilled. That means paying a contractor to sort out the rubbish - or doing it yourself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
