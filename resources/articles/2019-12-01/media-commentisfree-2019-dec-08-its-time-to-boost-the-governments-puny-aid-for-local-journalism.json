Rightly, the industry\u2019s trade body, the News Media Association, told them to stop it. In airing its outrage at this unseemly example of fake news, the NMA\u2019s statement referred to it as a \u201cdamaging practice which harms and undermines our democratic society\u201d. It called on politicians to consider the \u201cenormous challenges\u201d faced by regional and local news brands because the digital revolution has wrecked their business model and turned generations of print-readers into screen addicts. The NMA reminded our political class of the Cairncross review released earlier this year, which urged the government to provide direct financial support to public service news providers. It also called for the creation of a regulator in order to ensure fair play between the tech titans and news publishers. Regardless of who gets into No 10, I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath that these demands will be met. My hunch is that the incoming government, of whatever persuasion, will prefer to put its faith in an expansion of the Local News Partnerships, the joint initiative pioneered by the NMA and BBC, which was created prior to Cairncross. It has sprinkled ailing newspapers and websites across Britain with local democracy reporters (LDRs) to cover local councils and other public bodies, such as NHS trusts and police commissioners. The jobs are funded by the BBC but they are managed and employed by local news outlets. At present, there are 150 LDRs, many of whom are hugely enthusiastic about their work. Over the past year, I\u2019ve noted how several of these reporters have written hymns of praise about their contributions. No wonder. The scale of their coverage is breathtaking. In one week alone in September, some 1,300 of their stories were shared with the scheme\u2019s 900 partners, which were then transformed into 3,200 separate items published in print, online and on air. Town halls are being held to account. Everyone involved in this project views it as a success, but many more LDRs are required to widen the coverage. This is a major reason why both the BBC and the NMA are hoping for an expansion of the partnership. The plan is to create a not-for-profit company, which will enable it to accept external funding. \u201cI want businesses and other institutions to join with us,\u201d said the BBC\u2019s director general, Tony Hall, earlier this year. Additional external funding is necessary because the BBC\u2019s finances are already stretched. Despite the government\u2019s apparent wish to make it so, our public service broadcaster is not a branch of the social services. It is, however, committed to the support of local journalism. Note that. Not the support of local news brand owners, but the support of the activity of journalism itself. On face value, that sounds fine. I know it was the original intent. But isn\u2019t the reality rather different and troubling? In effect, the BBC is subsidising media organisations which have spent years reducing their editorial staffs to such low levels that they are unable carry out the basic journalistic task of reporting on local politics on their own. It means that the payers of the BBC\u2019s \u00a3154.50 licence fee are bankrolling profit-seeking companies that, in order to maintain unrealistic profit margins, have cynically fired the very people who provide news. Now, those businesses are able to draw on the work of journalists whose salaries they are no longer obliged to pay. No surprise then that, to quote Ken MacQuarrie, director of BBC Nations and Regions, it \u201chas been warmly welcomed by the news industry\u201d. You bet. In fairness, and this is a big point in the partnership\u2019s favour, the LDRs\u2019 content is shared. Aside from the BBC, all those signed up to the partnership \u2013 newspaper publishers large and small, independent websites, commercial broadcasters, community radio outlets \u2013 can receive the reporters\u2019 work, regardless of their location. LDRs are also only one of the partnership\u2019s three legs. There is also a shared data unit and a news hub. The data unit, with both BBC staff and journalists drawn from the 900 partner news outlets, produce data-led stories. The hub, meanwhile, provides local news websites with access to BBC video news content. However, the government should not be allowed to sit back and expect the BBC to make all the running and supply most of the funding in this important process. Henry Faure Walker, chief executive of Newsquest, the regional news chain ultimately owned by the US company, Gannett, has called on the government to provide \u201cproper\u201d financial help to support local journalism. He pointed out that Canada has set up a \u00a370m annual fund while Denmark is providing \u00a344m over six years for similar purposes. He didn\u2019t mention, but could have, that France hands out \u00a31bn a year to its press industry. Walker is underwhelmed with the single government initiative since Cairncross: the creation of a \u201cfuture news pilot fund\u201d which is offering grants of up to \u00a3100,000 to assist projects aimed at helping the regional press explore \u201cinnovative ways\u201d to provide local public interest journalism. Its overall \u00a32m budget looks anything but generous. As Walker says: \u201cIt certainly looks light compared to the \u00a31bn tax credits that go to other creative industries\u201d. If that sounds unimpressive, then the two initiatives by Silicon Valley\u2019s behemoths look pathetic when set against their enormous profits. Google\u2019s \u201cdigital news innovation fund\u201d has spent all of \u20ac115m (\u00a397m) on 550 projects in 30 European countries to fund new technologies which support good journalism. Then there is Facebook\u2019s \u00a34.5m \u201ccommunity news project\u201d, aimed at creating 80 reporters in under-served areas of Britain. All of this, although welcome, seems too little too late. The hollowing out of newsrooms across Britain amounts to a crisis for our democracy. Unless politicians take it seriously by finding a way to help the news industry without, of course, controlling its output, journalism will go to the wall."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
