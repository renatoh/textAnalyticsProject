In that event he beat the man who has made a habit of winning majors, Tiger Woods, for only the second time since the American turned professional in 1996. One might think then that Els enters the US PGA Championship, which begins at Hazeltine here tomorrow, in a confident frame of mind. After all the South African ended the possibility of a grand slam for Woods and then, when the occasion ultimately demanded it, produced one of the greatest bunker shots golf has seen to dispatch Thomas Levet on the fifth extra hole. Unfortunately Els, an amiable man in every respect, does not deal in certainties. He will not say that, yes, he is confident, only that, yes, maybe come Thursday he will be confident but that depends on how things go between now and then. For those who consider Els the most talented golfer in the world outside Woods, his diffident approach can be infuriating. If only he believed in himself to the extent that those around him do, maybe Woods would not be the favourite for everything he enters, or at least not such a short-priced favourite. But the South African, not the first player to underestimate himself, needs constant reassurance, which he gets from Jos Vanstiphout, a sports psychologist, and from David Leadbetter, his coach. Both know how good their man is; both struggle to impart that knowledge to the man himself. Els revealed yesterday, unwit tingly and frequently, the extent to which Woods has got into his head. After the four rounds of regular play in the Open, for instance, he had said he would be a different golfer whether he won or lost the play-off. Reminded of that yesterday, and asked if he was indeed different, he said: \"It's a little early to tell. Winning the Open I didn't play perfect golf and Tiger has won by big margins at times. He can blow people out of the water. \"I have got to keep working on my game although I think that, if you look at the whole picture of my career, it is turning in the right direction. I have to keep reaching for the next level. \"If I get there and really compete and challenge in majors, then maybe I can get to my ultimate goal, which is to win all four of them at least once.\" Els did not always hedge his conversation with qualifications. There used to be a quiet confidence about the man, a confidence that came from being as long as anyone in the game and, in his early days, possessing a winning record that surpassed almost everyone else. But Woods has destroyed that. Yesterday Els made reference to the majors of 2000, saying he had finished runner-up in three of them to Tiger. It may have felt like that, given that Woods's margins of victory in the US Open and Open were 15 and eight shots respectively, but it was Vijay Singh who beat him in the Masters. He was asked yesterday if by winning the Open and beating Woods in the process he had \"chipped away at the Tiger mystique\". His reply was depressing. \"If Tiger is on his game he is still going to beat me, probably. Of course, I might hole a couple of putts or I might chip in, you know, get lucky.\" These did not seem like words spoken to deflect attention, more that Els thought them an honest appraisal. But honest appraisals are not the stuff of top sport, where only a burning belief that you can get to the top actually takes you there. Els was asked, finally, if he agreed with the many people who saw him as the natural rival for Woods. Did he see himself in the same light? \"No, not really,\" he said. \"It's kind of a week-to-week thing, isn't it? I just want to play as good as I can. Let's see in a couple of years. I don't even want to think about that.\" Woods, despite going into the tournament in fine form after his win in the Buick Open last weekend, was not exactly upbeat himself. \"It's a weird phenomenon,\" he said. \"I've won tournaments in the past back to back. I've won two tournaments in a row and hopefully I can do it here.\" History gave him a reason for diffidence. The victory was Woods's first in an event preceding a major and in the past 33 years only two players have won a major the week after claiming another PGA Tour event. Woods, chasing Jack Nicklaus's record of 18 major titles, currently has eight to his name including two of the past three US PGA Championships and the Masters and US Open this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
