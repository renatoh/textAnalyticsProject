It was a dig at the lawyers who dominate New Labour, including his predecessor in the job, Jack Straw, and at the Prime Minister. But he also intended to show that a David Blunkett Home Office would have the common touch. Since then, he has been frank about his frustrations with the legal profession, particularly judges. The relationship reached a new low this weekend after Mr Blunkett described as 'bonkers' a decision by Mr Justice Collins, chair of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, to release on bail an Algerian Islamist held without charge under anti-terrorist legislation. The man, known as 'G', was released from Belmarsh high security prison because of his deteriorating mental health. He will be kept under strict house arrest with no access to mobile phones or the internet. With lawyerly precision in his choice of language, former Master of the Rolls Lord Donaldson yesterday entered the fray, suggesting the Home Secretary should have kept his thoughts to himself. Mr Blunkett's attitude was like being 'rude to the referee' in a football match, he suggested. Lord Donaldson was right. The Home Secretary's blunt speaking and refusal to be deferential towards the judiciary has often been refreshing but this is a situation that called for humanity and tact. The man involved, already disabled by polio, has been described as psychotic by doctors and any danger to the public has been contained by the harsh conditions of house arrest. Furthermore, Mr Blunkett needs to make it clear that, like all good citizens, he respects the rule of law even when decisions go against him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
