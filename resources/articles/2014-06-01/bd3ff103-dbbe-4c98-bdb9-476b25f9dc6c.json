So said Steve Hansen, the All Blacks head coach, after his side\u2019s loss to England at Twickenham 18 months ago, a defeat he predicted would niggle him for months. It will be much the same for Stuart Lancaster should New Zealand complete a 3-0 series \u201cblackwash\u201d. Another home win would also ensure a fourth straight defeat to the All Blacks this season, with a further psychologically-important meeting to come in London in November. As the England wing Chris Ashton succinctly put it on the eve of the third Test: \u201cWe\u2019d all be pretty upset to lose 3-0.\u201d Lancaster\u2019s touring team desperately want to fly home having reinforced their competitive credentials 15 months out from the 2015 Rugby World Cup. Watching England\u2019s footballers in Brazil has only served to highlight the areas Lancaster and his coaches still have to address. Had Luis Su\u00e1rez been playing for England they would surely have won, so irresistibly sharp were the Uruguayan\u2019s finishing instincts. A shortage of world-class anticipation and a reliable cutting edge have also been among English rugby\u2019s recurring issues; they will not lift their own World Cup either until such qualities have been instilled. Andy Farrell, England\u2019s assistant coach, conceded as much after England\u2019s final training session of the tour. Hailing New Zealand as \u201cthe best side in the world at getting over the line\u201d in tight games, he is demanding greater attacking accuracy from his own players. \u201cThe All Blacks are composed when it really matters and we can learn a big lesson from that. It\u2019s about recognising the opportunity, not over-playing, being one step ahead and striking while the iron\u2019s hot.\u201d Quite so. It makes the return of the try-poaching Ashton on England\u2019s wing doubly intriguing. Until the last three months, self-doubt had begun to cloak his talent. Would he have run in the long-range try that Manu Tuilagi could not score in Dunedin? Recent evidence strongly suggests so. But can he become as prolific a figure at the highest level as Julian Savea? The latter is currently the standard by which all English wings need to be measured. Ashton has already scored one try in this series despite having only been on the field for a few minutes and believes the dark days of midwinter, when he lost his Test place, are behind him. \u201cI\u2019ve just enjoyed it again: You sometimes forget that but it\u2019s the main reason why I\u2019m here. \u201cConfidence is a funny thing sometimes. When things aren\u2019t going your way it is hard.\u201d Lancaster, in turn, has been suitably reassured by the efforts the 27-year-old has made to improve his defence and produce the calmer decisions Farrell is seeking. The head coach also reminded the Saracens wing it was \u201cbetter to be the hunter than the hunted\u201d, precisely the kind of reassuring yet proactive message Ashton needed to hear. It has also helped ensure that, unlike his fellow Wiganer Joel Tomkins, Ashton is happy to stay in union and take his chances. He prefers to trust his on-field instincts, too, reckoning he plays best when he avoids overthinking. That may just be true as well of England\u2019s other league import, Kyle Eastmond. Not for the first time English rugby has turned to the 13-man code for something different and Ashton reckons union supporters have yet to fully appreciate the Bath centre. \u201cHe has an unbelievable skill set that has yet to be shown in union,\u201d suggested Ashton. \u201cThe more experience he gets he\u2019ll be one hell of a threat.\u201d Ashton also reckons the Bath-bound Sam Burgess will have a thunderbolt\u2019s impact when he arrives from South Sydney, regardless of what union purists think: \u201cHe won\u2019t take much bedding-in time ... his size and the threat he poses make him a completely different kettle of fish.\u201d But power and speed are all very well; England need to think more clearly to outwit an All Blacks side who have not been ahead at half-time in four of their last five games and still won the lot. As England\u2019s captain, Chris Robshaw, has reiterated to his players, rocket science is not involved. \u201cA lot of times it\u2019s just doing the basics well,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the 50th minute when the ball has been in play for a couple of minutes ... who still has that mental capacity to do the right thing at the right time? That\u2019s what it comes down to.\u201d England, adds Robshaw, also feel they have \u201cnothing to lose\u201d this weekend. Geoff Parling\u2019s late withdrawal with a hamstring strain may encourage the All Black lineout but the visiting pack, with Joe Launchbury now starting and Dave Attwood on the bench, insist they still have one final push left in them. \u201cA lot of us probably won\u2019t get the opportunity to come to New Zealand again as a touring party so it is kind of now or never,\u201d suggested Robshaw. \u201cThat\u2019s the mentality we are taking into this game. We can still finish the season on a high.\u201d Either way, insists Farrell, England\u2019s rivals will be \u201ca little bit nervous\u201d by the time the World Cup comes around. \u201cWe\u2019ll be on fire by the World Cup, there\u2019ll be no doubt about that.\u201d The increasing respect England have gained around New Zealand for their courtesy and behaviour on this tour will, even so, be of only limited consolation should they lose again now. \u201cThey might say nice things about us but deep down they\u2019d love a 3-0,\u201d suggested Ashton. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve pushed them so close we\u2019d like to get a win. They\u2019ll know it\u2019s not been done by England here since 2003 which turned out to be an unbelievable year for that team. I don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t do the same.\u201d If the All Blacks win again, on the other hand, there will be a lot of rocks beneath English beach towels this summer. This is a big game for ... Ben Youngs Scrum-half has been a problematic area for England on this trip. Danny Care\u2019s unfortunate training ground tumble effectively ruled him out of two Tests and he did not look himself in Dunedin either. Youngs was equally fallible in Auckland and can ill afford another poor performance now. Freddie Burns Burns does not suffer massively from nerves, which is just as well. If he can replicate the assurance he showed at Eden Park, he will join Leicester this summer with his confidence fully restored. Take a step backwards and Danny Cipriani is coming up fast on the rails. Owen Farrell\u2019s knee injury has made this another massive opportunity for both men. Kyle Eastmond In, out, shake it all about. The English midfield hokey-cokey continues, with Eastmond and Manu Tuilagi reunited in the centres and both Billy Twelvetrees and Luther Burrell jettisoned. If Eastmond, in particular, causes more problems on the gainline, Stuart Lancaster will find it hard to drop him this autumn. Chris Ashton With the Tuilagi wing project failing to take flight in Dunedin, this is Ashton\u2019s chance to show what he can do. He already has 19 Test tries in 38 Tests for England but lost his place in the Six Nations. Jack Nowell, Jonny May, Christian Wade and Anthony Watson will all be looking on with interest. Dylan Hartley Hartley has been waiting for this opportunity for years: a Test match up the road from his native Rotorua, a chance to show Kiwis what they missed when he left for England as a teenager. With Rob Webber having enhanced his reputation on this trip and Tom Youngs still part of the hooking equation, it is a big game for Hartley all round.
