If part of the intention was to dampen wage increases, it is doubtful a rate rise will have the desired effect. The economy is already expected to slow over the course of the year.\" He added that unless wage settlements picked up significantly in the coming months that inflation would fall back towards the Bank's target of 2% during the second half of 2007. David Kern, economic adviser to the British Chambers of Commerce, also warned that slowing growth in the US may impact the UK economy and the Bank of England should have waited longer. \"We appreciate the MPC must make difficult choices, and we accept that inflationary pressures have edged up. But we believe that the clear risks that growth may slow sharply in both the US and eurozone should have been taken more fully into account by the MPC before tightening policy. \"The MPC could have afforded to wait until trends in the labour market became clearer. If firm evidence emerges that there is no acceleration in wage settlements, the MPC should consider an early reversal of today's increase in interest rates.\" TUC head of economics Adam Lent said: \"Today's decision smacks of panic rather than considered judgement. The MPC itself has said that it expects inflation to fall in 2007 as the effects of higher energy prices fade. There is not enough evidence to justify an increase in rates, which will be damaging for industry.\" The Engineering Employers' Federation strong criticised today's increase as well, believing it would risk slowing the economy more sharply than necessary. They added it was wrong to increase rates without firmer evidence of the Christmas trading pattern and January pay round. EEF Director General, Martin Temple, said: \"We are surprised and disappointed by today's decision which is premature and risks bringing the economy to a sharper halt than is necessary. The Bank is in danger of damaging its hard won reputation for stability should this rise have to be quickly reversed.\" But Graeme Leach at the Institute of Directors agreed with the Bank's actions. \"This was a tough but wise decision. The MPC needed to stamp down on inflation given the upside risk at present. Inflation is well above target, spare capacity is low, money supply growth is high and the housing market looks perky. Throw in on top the risk of accelerating wage settlements and the Bank of England's pre-emptive strike looks sensible.\" Capital Economics said: \"The hike in UK interest rates from 5.0% to 5.25% is a pretty major shock and puts another dent in the MPC's claims that it likes to make policy 'boring'.\" While Capital agreed there were many dangers facing the economy, they added that it did not explain why the Bank chose to take markets by surprise today rather than hiking in February as a growing number of people had expected. \"One reason may have been to ensure that wage pressures remain subdued in the pay round which kicks off this month, but there must also be a strong suspicion that December's CPI figures - which the Committee would have had today - played a part.\" Capital said the figures were likely to show inflation rising further, possibly above 3%, which would mean the Bank would have to write a letter of explanation to the Treasury. \"The MPC may have felt that a hike today will make a letter easier to write. Whatever the reason, the MPC's urgency, coupled with the emphasis on factors such as money growth which look set to remain strong in the foreseeable future, suggest that another hike is perfectly possible over the coming months.\" Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight: \"This is a real surprise. Although we had expected interest rates to rise again, we thought the Bank of England would delay acting until at least February when it had a clearer idea of what was happening in the 2007 pay rounds and just how strong consumer spending was over the Christmas and New Year period.\" \"While we are surprised by the timing of this move, we still believe that 5.25% will prove the peak in interest rates this year. Indeed, by acting firmly now, the Bank of England may well have reduced the chances of interest rates eventually having to rise further.\" Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management said: \"By raising rates ahead of expectations, the MPC have achieved more bang for their buck and ensured that the current high level of inflation does not feed into a shift in expectations. However, as the economy slows in reaction to three rate rises and inflation falls back later in the year, thanks in part to falling energy costs, sentiment on UK rates will shift and I expect the next move will be down.\" \u00b7 Email business.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
