One of the handful that's getting attention is the The Mile Wall, which is selling space horizontally, an inch at a time. It could become the longest page in Internet history. So far it's up to 8ft. \"At $1 per square inch for an entire lifetime online it's a real bargain, especially if you're used to paying $1 for a single pixel!\" writes Travis Smith, the 19 year old college student beind The Wall. The site opened on January 1 and has just been featured by TechWeb News. A more Web 2.0-style idea is 1000tags.com. According to TechCrunch: \"1000Tags is different enough from MillionDollarHomePage that I think it will have a lot of sucess, too. They call it \"the first commercial tag cloud\". And that's exactly what it it. You can purchase a tag, pay by the character and font size, and hope that a lot of traffic to your site is the result.\" Shared tags cost $5 per character, with a minimum of $25."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
