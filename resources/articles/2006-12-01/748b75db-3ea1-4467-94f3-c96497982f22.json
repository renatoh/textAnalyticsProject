Viewing the created environment as a series of theatrical set-ups against which our dramas are acted out can be as unnerving as it can be instructive, as Shakespeare himself observed. So, in our urban- and media- dominated world, just who are the playwrights and the directors? Work here ranges from a sense of willing enchantment by the aesthetic charms of industrialisation through to attempts to deface institutional facades. Emily Richardson's videos reveal oil rigs to be veritable temples of illumination. Stephen Turner pictures a second world war coastal fortress to be imbued with a more oppressive charm, while Rory Macbeth documents his ironic act of spray painting the 44,000 word text of Thomas More's Utopia over a hotel prior to its demolition. RC \u00b7 Northern Gallery For Contemporary Art, to Feb 3 Arthur Bispo Do Ros\u00e1rio Llandudno On Christmas Eve 1938 Arthur Bispo Do Ros\u00e1rio was incarcerated in the Rio de Janeiro psychiatric hospital where he was to spend the next 50 years of his life. So began the creative life of one of the most fascinating so-called \"outsider artists\". Whether one categorises him as visionary or paranoid schizophrenic, it is undeniably possible to mention Do Ros\u00e1rio in the same breath as the likes of Duchamp, Beuys and Bourgeois. This selection of his wonderful concoctions of discarded objects, all meticulously cross-referenced according to a highly personal system of visual puns, is quite a coup for Oriel Mostyn. RC \u00b7 Oriel Mostyn, to Jan 27 Melanie Jackson Bristol Road Angel is an extraordinary film in which artist Melanie Jackson diligently aspires to trace every component of a global positioning system back to its original source. Her pedantry takes her to the rubber trees of Sri Lanka, the tin mines of the Congo and the production lines of China. As a study of the free market economy, it's quite mind boggling and also nicely compliments her rambling installation, Some Things You Are Not Allowed To Send Around The World. Including a list of items that are forbidden to be received according to post office guidelines, such as funeral urns in Algeria and goods originating from Cuba in the USA, it's a perceptive survey of different countries' political and social agendas. JL \u00b7 Arnolfini, Sat 9 to Jan 28 Art Now Live Work London A one-day event at Tate Britain featuring performances by Sue Tompkins, Rory MacBeth, Joanne Tatham and Tom O'Sullivan kicks off with MacBeth at 12noon today. An ex-street painter, MacBeth is a canny critic of social history. Likewise Tompkins, a poet performer recently nominated for the Beck's Futures Prize, whose disconcerting happenings - one-liners, disjointed sentences and gaping pauses - are spartan verses for the dispossessed. Joanne Tatham and Tom O'Sullivan bring their brand of slapstick and irreverent allegorical folk plays to the gallery, creating an engaging collection of dramatic theatrics. JL \u00b7 Tate Britain, SW1, Sat 9 Melik Ohanian London Melik Ohanian's epic video installation Seven Minutes Before is a thrilling, dream-like narrative offering seven different perspectives of a cataclysmic event. Set in southern France, the audience are pitched into a world of biblical proportions in which a nomadic preacher, a caged wolf and a speeding car are united as symbols of the tragedy to come. Born in Lyon in 1969, Ohanian is of Armenian descent, and this 21-minute film, part of his first UK solo exhibition, reveals an artist who can weave complex ideas into an engaging narrative. JL \u00b7 South London Gallery, SE5, to Dec 22 Chelpa Ferro And juneau/projects Liverpool Two collaborative groups, from Brazil and the UK, respectively, Chelpa Ferro and juneau/projects present irreverent but engaging audio-visual crossover projects. The Wood Street area of Liverpool has become a hotbed of gentrified development, as the city prepares for its 2008 city of culture jamboree. As the racket of drills mixes with the rhythmical emissions of wine bars, Chelpa Ferro aim to infiltrate the gallery with something of the area's ambience in an installation wielding, among other devices, motors and plastic bags. The title of the juneau/projects/ computer game, Beneath The Floorboards Of The Forest, Empty Space, gives away a little of their mix of mock romanticism and self-mocking popularism. RC \u00b7 FACT, to Jan 21 John Armleder Liverpool It's impossible to predict what the Swiss artist, curator, critic, painter, sculptor and cultural provocateur John Armleder will come up with next. Emerging from the anti-traditionalist Fluxus group in the 1960s, it is part of Armleder's ongoing creative agenda that he constantly shifts and changes, working in just about all available media. His art amounts to a series of architectural interventions through which the predictable cultural or practical usages of a space are undermined in a spirit of enigmatic wonderment. What he'll make of the Tate's ground floor gallery is, enticingly, anyone's guess. RC \u00b7 Tate Liverpool, Thu 14 to Feb 25 Happy Birthday Miffy London The reopening of the popular Museum Of Childhood - a 130 year-old building in Bethnal Green - after a \u00a34.7m facelift will be accompanied by an exhibition of another much-loved character, Miffy. Created by Dick Bruna, the mild-mannered graphic illustrator and author from the Netherlands, the mute little rabbit has delighted children and adults alike for half a century, becoming a global phenomenon that has gained cult status in Japan. Her deadpan expression and lucid observations on life are endearingly charming, combining a dry wit with a sensitive pathos. In particular, there are few stories more poignant than Dear Grandma Bunny, which features the death of Miffy's beloved granny. This retrospective features original artwork including drawings, silkscreen prints, books and photographs charting the changing face of Miffy through the decades.
