What they really want, as was made volubly clear during this stroll for Liverpool, is for time to be called on Avram Grant's reign. There may not be long to wait, on this evidence. There is a vast difference between defeat and humiliation, and Liverpool capitalised on a truly woeful first-half display from the visitors to inflict the latter here. David Sullivan and David Gold, the West Ham owners who will ultimately determine Grant's fate, had to listen to repeated chants of \"Paolo Di Canio\" from the away section, as their club remain adrift with Wolves at the bottom of the Premier League. Problems must run deep when a man with no managerial experience is being touted as your saviour. \"The moment I think I cannot do my job, I will not be here,\" said the former Chelsea and Portsmouth manager. \"But I am sure I can do a good job and that I can take the club forward.\" His employers currently share the same view, at least in public, but outright antagonism towards a manager and abject performances on the pitch usually create only one answer. \"We missed a lot of players but we still should have performed better,\" added Grant. \"But at least the second half was good and we showed it's not easy to break us even in a bad situation.\" The tone was set in the opening seconds. Liverpool began with an energy and purpose the visitors never matched, and went close through Glen Johnson, David Ngog, Maxi Rodr\u00edguez and Fernando Torres inside the first 10 minutes. At no point did it seem Liverpool would rue those misses and, on 18 minutes, three West Ham players challenged three opponents for a Raul Meireles corner. Johnson not only beat Herita Ilunga in the air to take the ball on his chest, he then had acres of space to drive the second ball low under Robert Green. Eight minutes later, Torres twisted his way into the West Ham area only for Danny Gabbidon to flick the ball away with his hand. There was no dispute from the visitors (minus Scott Parker they are not a team with an ounce of fight in them), and Dirk Kuyt, who spread the play from midfield unopposed all game, drilled the penalty straight down the middle as Green dived to his left. That was as much as even West Ham's stoical travelling support could take. \"You're getting sacked in the morning\" and chants for their former Italian idol soon reverberated from one corner of the Anfield Road. Davids Gold and Sullivan shifted uncomfortably in the directors' box, and Kevin Keen, the first-team coach, looked to the heavens. There was no salvation to be found up there. As Roy Hodgson would no doubt confirm following his own turbulent start at Liverpool, judgement is passed rapidly in the Premier League these days. But it is also unavoidable following performances such as this from West Ham. They were appalling, lacking in movement, adventure and, as Victor Obinna showed when he allowed Johnson to race past him inside the West Ham penalty area in the opening minute, any passion whatsoever. A butterfly possesses stronger wings than West Ham's left flank of Obinna and Ilunga, and more heart, although Liverpool's third arrived from the equally porous right. The industrious Rodr\u00edguez released Torres inside the area and though Green denied the Spaniard with his legs, former West Ham man Paul Konchesky returned the loose ball with an exquisite cross for the Argentinean to apply an equally polished header into the far corner. Obinna produced West Ham's first shot of note in first-half stoppage time. The only net it found was that hanging off the stand. Neither the ball nor the Nigerian would be seen again. West Ham at least showed some professional pride and defensive resilience after the interval, with Green saving superbly from Torres and Christian Poulsen in quick succession, but that did not stem the tide of vitriol towards the former Chelsea and Portsmouth manager. THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT IAN BOLLAND, Observer reader West Ham were poor, to be blunt. They didn't have many ideas but we looked pretty balanced for once, which was down to Meireles in the middle. I might be sticking my neck out but we looked a lot more balanced without Gerrard \u2013 it wasn't a case of give it to the one man all the time; we played as a team. It was Meireles's best performance for us because he was played in his right position in the middle from where he practically bossed the game. Dirk Kuyt and Maxi both had decent games, which gave the wing-backs space to go forward. Glen Johnson looked a lot more assured than usual. The fan's player ratings Reina 6; Johnson 7, Carragher 6, Skrtel 6, Konchesky 6; Kuyt 7, Meireles 8 (Shelvey 83 6), Poulsen 6, Rodr\u00edguez 7; Torres 6 (Babel 84 n/a) Ngog 6 (Aur\u00e9lio 73 6) HAMISH MACKAY, Over Land And Sea This was the most shocking, gutless and incompetent display I have ever witnessed from a West Ham team. All the talk before the game was about Steven Gerrard being missing, but the man most sorely missed today was Scott Parker. When he plays West Ham are a poor team, but when he doesn't play they are a very, very poor team. On this performance they are absolute dead certs for the drop . Liverpool could have had five, six or seven. If it hadn't been for Green they would definitely have had five. At the end the fans showed how disappointed they were. There was no game plan, and even worse, no fight. The fan's player ratings Green 8; Jacobsen 5, Gabbidon 5, Upson 6, Ilunga 3 (Tomkins 76 4); Kovac 4; Piquionne 5, Noble 6; Boa Morte 4, Obinna 2 (Barrera 46 4); Cole 5 (McCarthy 69 3) To take part in the Fans' Verdict, email sport@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
