The company said it was legally obliged to pay traders $165m (\u00a3118m) in \"guaranteed\" bonuses, despite the near collapse of the insurer last September and its subsequent $173bn bailout by US taxpayers. Staff at the company's offices in London \u2013 many of them in the financial products division identified as the root cause of its downfall \u2013 are included in the payout. In an effort to quell a mounting furore, the Treasury Department said late last night that it would require AIG to repay the government more than $165 million in bonuses doled out last week. In a letter to congressional leaders, Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner said the money would be deducted from the government's latest $30 billion infusion of bailout funds to the insurance giant at the centre of the nation's deepening financial crisis. Geithner also said future bonuses would be subject to tough new limits now being developed for crippled companies getting rescued with taxpayers' money. Meanwhile, New York's top legal officer, attorney general Andrew Cuomo, said he would issue subpoenas against AIG after the company missed an 8pm deadline tonight to release details of the bonuses. Cuomo said he was looking into whether the AIG payments were contractually required or could be voided under New York law. \"We need this information immediately in order to investigate and determine whether any of the individuals receiving such payments were involved in the conduct that led to AIG's demise and subsequent bailout,\" Cuomo wrote in a letter to Edward Liddy, AIG's chairman and chief executive. In addition to the list of people set to receive bonuses, Cuomo demanded details about who developed the bonus plans and a status report on whether payments have been made. \"Covering up the details of these payments breeds further cynicism and distrust in our already shaken financial system,\" Cuomo wrote. Liddy had previously said in a letter to Geithner, that lawyers had advised the company that \"retention benefits\" were enforceable in the courts and could not be withdrawn without causing a breach of contract. Liddy said he feared the best-qualified staff would leave if they faced \"continued and arbitrary adjustment\" of their pay by the US treasury. Stung by increasing criticism of Wall Street bonuses, Obama said AIG had failed to address the reasonable concerns of ordinary Americans, many of whom were losing their jobs. \"This is a corporation that finds itself in financial distress due to recklessness and greed,\" he said. \"Under these circumstances, it's hard to understand how derivative traders at AIG warranted any bonuses, much less $165m in extra pay,\" he told a group of small-business owners at the White House. \"How do they justify this outrage to the taxpayers who are keeping the company afloat?\" Obama said he had asked Geithner to use the government's majority ownership of the company and White House lawyers to pursue \"every legal avenue\" to push back against the bonus payments. \"I know he's working to resolve this matter with the new chief executive, Edward Liddy, who came on board after the contracts that led to these bonuses were agreed to last year,\" Obama said. The president said the bonus situation underscored the need for financial regulatory reform and the government needed \"some form of resolution mechanism in dealing with troubled financial institutions, so we have greater authority to protect the American taxpayer and our financial system in cases such as this. We will work with Congress to that end.\" White House officials are concerned at the US public's growing resistance to further bailouts of the banks and insurers while large bonuses continue to be paid to traders and senior executives. AIG was rescued by the Bush administration after it became concerned that the company had underwritten many of the \"toxic\" derivatives sold by banks and its collapse could undermine the entire financial system. Obama is due to meet other G20 leaders in London next month with a view to agreeing a package of measures to underpin the finances of the banks and stabilise the financial system. The issue of bonuses payments at AIG and other financial firms is likely to generate further difficult headlines for the Obama regime and increased resistance in Congress to the use of more federal funds. This month the insurer announced a $61.7bn fourth-quarter loss \u2013 the largest quarterly loss reported by a US company. Liddy, who is expected to face a criticism on Wednesday when he appears before a congressional subcommittee investigating the insurer's bailout, said: \"I do not like these arrangements and find it distasteful and difficult to recommend to you that we must proceed with them. \"I would have designed these differently and at significantly lower levels. \"I am committed, however, to working within the existing arrangements to get the most out of them for AIG's constituencies. \u2026 Honouring contractual commitments is at the heart of what we do in the insurance business.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
