It is understood that some senior Tory backbenchers plan to oppose the idea if it comes to the floor of the Commons, saying it will be the government's first defeat. Two former Labour home secretaries, Jack Straw and David Blunkett, also condemned the plan yesterday, saying it was entirely unprecedented and undemocratic in parliamentary procedure. However, one of the idea's creators, former Lib Dem MP and law professor David Howarth, defended the plan. Howarth, who stood down at the election, stressed that under his proposal the 55% majority would only be required for a fixed-term parliament to be dissolved, but not for a vote of confidence in a government. Any confidence motion would still require only a simple majority to be passed, or for the government to fall. He argued that if a government lost a confidence vote then it would be dissolved, but parliament would continue until a new government capable of commanding a Commons majority was found. The House of Commons library said there are no occasions when anything more than a simple majority or a majority of one is required. The Tories opposed the idea outright only two years ago, with one backbencher, Christopher Chope, saying a fixed-term parliament \"would give the incumbent party an even greater unfair advantage\". Blunkett said: \"This is a profoundly anti-democratic move by the proponents of what is supposed to be the 'new politics'. The numbers mean that it would be impossible, even if every opposition MP united against this coalition, for the house to express its lack of confidence in it. \"This is nothing less than a stitch-up by the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats to overturn historic precedents for their own advantage. If Labour had attempted something like this in government, the Lib Dems in particular would have been incandescent.\" Jack Straw, another former home secretary, said the idea was unworkable, anti-democratic, and a fix. \"What if 51 % of the Commons was against any confidence in the government and it was not possible to pass legislation: you would be in the extraordinary position where parliament cannot be dissolved because Liberal Democrats were scared of losing their seats, but parliament was unable to work.\" Former Labour lord chancellor Lord Falconer said he backed the idea of fixed-term parliaments, but warned the present proposals risked leaving an impotent \"zombie\" government in power. \"Assume 53% of parliament vote against the Conservatives \u2013 that's what all the other parties equal excluding the Conservatives \u2013 they can't be removed,\" he told BBC2's Newsnight. \"So if that were to happen a year before the last date for a general election we would have a \u2026 zombie government.\" The Lib Dem peer Lord Rennard defended the plan. \"We think in the national interest and wanted to know the Conservatives could not cut and run any time they thought they could win a general election. But the Conservatives also said they wanted the surety of knowing the Liberal Democrats couldn't do the same thing either: cut and run and try to force an early general election.\" In 2007, Howarth proposed a fixed-term parliament bill, arguing that a prime ministers' right to call an election at a time of their choosing was \"rather like having a 100-metre race in which one of the runners has the starting pistol and can occasionally use it to shoot one of the other runners\". The Tories opposed it then and a pressure group at the time released a poll of MPs showing that the move was supported by only 25% of Conservative MPs at the time, 41% of Labour MPs and 88% of Liberal Democrat MPs. In a briefing paper for the political website Left Foot Forward, Robert Hazell said the move \"is intended to strengthen the hand of the Lib Dems: Cameron could not call an early election without the consent of his coalition partners, because the Conservatives command only 47% of the votes in the Commons\". Opposition to the current plan was yesterday also growing outside parliament, with a website, \"No to 55%\", campaigning against the measure. A similar Facebook group had more than 2,500 members by yesterday afternoon. Lawyers said the proposals would not bind future parliaments or change the constitution because a motion introducing the change could be amended or repealed by a simple majority. Jeffrey Jowell QC, professor of constitutional law at UCL, said: \"There is nothing wrong with this provision constitutionally. Parliament can legislate as it wishes. But a statute providing for a 55% majority could be amended next year with a simple majority.\" \"How would this bind?\" asked Vernon Bogdanor, professor of government at Oxford University. \"It seems no more to me than a commitment of honour. Parliament can do what it likes. If political exigencies dictate a breaking-up of the coalition, this legislation could be repealed by a simple majority.\" There were calls, however, for the measures to be abandoned as undemocratic. \"This is tinkering,\" said Richard Gordon QC at Brick Court Chambers, author of a recent book on the constitution, Repairing British Politics. \"Fifty-five percent locks you into something that's in danger of being undemocratic. It props up a government that doesn't ordinarily command an overall majority. In truth, this is short-term expediency to keep the coalition going for five years and sets a dangerous precedent for other constitutional changes.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
