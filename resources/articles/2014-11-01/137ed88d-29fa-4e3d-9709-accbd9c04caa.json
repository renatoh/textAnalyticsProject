Putting an extra \u00a372m a year into family doctors and practice nurses could save the NHS up to \u00a31.9bn by 2020 by reducing pressure on overstretched services, the report says. The study, by management consultants Deloitte, says that increasing the budget for GP practices would save the NHS \u00a35 for every additional pound put in. It estimates that the \u00a372m boost to the \u00a39.55bn that general practice already receives across the UK would save at least \u00a3133.9m a year by diverting up to 1.7 million patients from A&amp;E. That would reduce the bill for A&amp;E services from \u00a31.58bn to \u00a31.44bn. The extra spending would also cut by 545,000 the number of times patients call an ambulance unnecessarily, reducing the cost involved from \u00a31.66bn to \u00a31.52bn. Freeing family doctors to spend more time caring for those aged 65 and over at home would reduce the length of time they need to spend in hospital, saving another \u00a3170.1m, calculates Deloitte\u2019s report, which was commissioned by the Royal College of GPs (RCGP). By spending a total of \u00a3360m \u2013 \u00a372m in each of the next five years \u2013 the NHS could expect to have saved as much as \u00a31.9bn by then, the report found. Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, signalled his backing for the RCGP\u2019s campaign for general practice to be given more of the NHS\u2019s budget. He backed a \u201cnew deal for GPs\u201d, which would see them expand the roles they perform. \u201cThe NHS\u2019s Five Year Forward View forcefully argues for more prevention, integration and innovation, supported by new investment and a new deal for GPs. So the RCGP are right to push for expanded primary care, which is better for patients and can help offset pressures on hospitals\u201d, Stevens said. Dr Maureen Baker, the chair of the RCGP, urged NHS leaders and ministers to act on Deloitte\u2019s findings. \u201cIt would be economically illiterate to ignore the savings that would come from increased investment in general practice,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are constantly hearing about the pressures that A&amp;E departments are under. Yet these figures demonstrate that by spending more on general practice, we could prevent 8.5m unnecessary A&amp;E attendances, more than 2.7m unnecessary ambulance callouts and generate a massive \u00a31.9bn in savings to the NHS over the course of the next parliament.\u201d The RCGP believes that the number of GP appointments, which has risen sharply in recent years, will hit a record 441m by 2017/18 because of the demands posed by an ageing population and rise in lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes. This year is likely to see 388 million patients having a consultation at their GP surgery. The extra investment could also help in the long term to reduce smoking and the health impact of excess drinking by letting GPs help patients to adopt healthier lifestyles. More and more GP surgeries are opening in the evenings and at weekends as part of the drive by David Cameron to extend their hours, which is helping to relieve the strain on hospital emergency departments, the college said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
