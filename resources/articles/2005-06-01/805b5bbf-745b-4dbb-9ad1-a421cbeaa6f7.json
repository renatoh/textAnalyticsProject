Just as there has never been a stronger Maori side than the one assembled by the outgoing coach Matt Te Pou, who has picked nine All Blacks in a team so laden with talent that Carlos Spencer is only on the bench, so the Lions have never been represented by a meatier front-line unit than the English trio of Andrew Sheridan, Steve Thompson and Julian White. Between them the powerful threesome weigh 348kg, which equates to almost 55 stone. Prior to this tour the record was set in 1955 by the all-Welsh front row of Billy Williams (Swansea), Bryn Meredith (Newport) and Courtney Meredith (Neath), who weighed in at a combined weight of 278kg (43st 11lb) against Rhodesia and the fourth Test against the Springboks. Even by modern standards, however, there has never been anything quite like the red juggernaut which Woodward is preparing to unleash. Sheridan alone is 6ft 5in tall, weighs 19st and is capable of bench-pressing 215kg. He may have won only one cap for England - as a replacement against Canada last season - but the 26-year-old Sale loose-head is clearly seen by the Lions management as a potentially destructive menace. If he goes well tomorrow - his last outing at home saw him squeeze the fight out of Pau in the European Challenge Cup final - he stands every chance of being in the 22-man squad for the first Test against New Zealand in Christchurch on June 25 and, at his current rate of progress, may yet start the game. None of the other loose-heads in the party has, as yet, made an unanswerable case for Test selection. The Maori will also have to contend with the massive second-row presence of Simon Shaw, who slots in beside the Irish vice-captain Paul O'Connell to complete a front five which, on paper, looks formidable even in the absence of Lawrence Dallaglio behind them. The possibilities are so exciting that the Lions coach Andy Robinson found himself attempting to dampen down the expectation, suggesting that New Zealand tight-forward play was stronger than many had recently insisted. \"We have a lot of respect for the Maori front row,\" he said. \"Everybody has been saying that New Zealand forward play in general has not been as it was, but I don't think that's been the case. I think they have put a lot of attention into their set plays, and as we saw in the Taranaki game these guys are very good scrummagers.\" The Maori can boast the similarly massive Carl Hayman, who is all but certain to be the All Black tight-head against the Lions. The Maori have never beaten the tourists in seven attempts, though, and will be facing opponents who, after victories in their first two games in New Zealand, are determined to impress in a game being billed as an unofficial \"fourth Test\". It is still too early to state precisely what Woodward's first-Test line-up will be but several of those involved tomorrow will have every chance of being in it if they can thrive in the most demanding fixture of the tour so far. Wales's Stephen Jones, in particular, could make the contest for the No10 jersey even more interesting - England's Jonny Wilkinson is not even on the bench and is now set to start his first match in New Zealand next Wednesday in Wellington - and Scotland's No8 Simon Taylor has his first run-out since recovering from hamstring trouble. \"Simon is raring to go,\" confirmed Robinson. \"Having seen the good performances of the back row over the past two games, we want Simon to perform to that level and put pressure on everybody in fighting for that Test spot.\" Opportunity also knocks for Gordon D'Arcy at No12 and the Welsh wings Shane Williams and Tom Shanklin, both of whom will be doing well if they outperform their opposite numbers, Rico Gear and Caleb Ralph. \"This will be the strongest team on paper that I've ever had,\" insisted Te Pou when he named his squad. \"I've been involved with the team since 1994 and we've never had all our All Blacks available.\" If the Lions pack do flex their considerable muscles, it should be some game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
