When One Off landed the odds under Jamie Mackay yesterday at Wolverhampton the Newmarket trainer had sent out 10 winners from 31 runners in the past fortnight and three of them - No Refuge, Coat Of Honour and Analogy - look set to strike again today. No Refuge (2.15) can start the Prescott treble at Hamilton in the opening George Wimpey Handicap. The three-year-old, who carries a 6lb penalty, returns to turf after two wins on the all-weather tracks at Wolverhampton and last Saturday at Lingfield where he romped in by seven lengths from Foretold. His one defeat this season was on firm ground at Newbury where he was third. Today's underfoot conditions should be perfect at the Scottish venue for this colt who looks to have plenty of room for improvement. Coat Of Honour (3.30) also carries a 6lb penalty, in the 10-furlong handicap at Brighton, but the handicapper will soon reassess him much higher after his six-length romp to beat Midnight Song at Pontefract. Analogy (4.30) , also at Brighton, is getting the idea of things now and he can follow up his head victory at Ayr."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
