Delicious to eat and quick to cook, it\u2019s easy to see why pad thai has been so successful at bringing a country together. Prep 15 min, plus soaking Cook 5 min Serves 2 120g rice noodles, ideally 2-3mm wide flat rice sticks, but any will do really 60ml fish sauce, or light soy sauce mixed with a little lime juice or rice vinegar 60ml tamarind water (or tamarind concentrate thinned with a little water) 60g palm sugar, or maple sugar, maple syrup reduced until caramelised, or dark brown sugar 1 pinch chilli powder, to taste 2 garlic cloves, peeled 100g extra-firm tofu, drained 8 large prawns 2 large eggs 25g preserved salted radish (optional) 4 stalks Chinese chives, or spring onions 50g roasted peanuts 80ml groundnut or vegetable oil 1 tbsp small dried shrimp (optional) 100g beansprouts Lime wedges, chilli flakes, fish sauce and sugar, to garnish 1 Soak the noodles Pad thai cooks in minutes, so it\u2019s essential to have all the ingredients prepped and ready before you so much as look at the wok. Begin by soaking the rice sticks in cold water for about half an hour, until pliable but still al dente, rather than soft. Drain well and set aside by the hob alongside a small glass of cold water. 2 Make the sauce While the noodles are soaking, make the pad thai sauce. Put the fish sauce, tamarind and palm sugar in a small pan and heat gently, stirring to dissolve the sugar, then turn off the heat. Season with chilli, then taste and adjust the balance to suit your palate. 3 Prep the rest Prepare the remaining ingredients and set them out near the hob in the order they go into the pan (as below). Finely chop the garlic and cut the tofu into bite-sized cubes. Devein the prawns, if necessary (I like to leave them unshelled, but it\u2019s up to you), and crack the eggs into a small bowl. Roughly chop the radish (if using), chives and peanuts. 4 Start cooking Before you turn on the hob, get ready your serving dishes, cutlery, accompaniments and any dining companions, because the cooking process is very fast. Put a wok on a high heat and, once hot, add half the oil, followed by the garlic, and stir-fry for a few seconds, until aromatic. 5 Cook the noodles Add the drained noodles to the wok, along with a splash of the water from the glass, tossing to break up any clumps. Fry until they start to dry out, then add the sauce and cook, tossing continuously, until the noodles are almost done (they should still be slightly chewy, ideally, but it\u2019s a matter of taste; just bear in mind that they\u2019ll be cooked a little more before you\u2019re finished). 6 Fry the protein Push the noodles to the side of the wok, so they\u2019re no longer over a direct heat, then pour the remaining oil into the pan. Add the tofu and prawns, and cook, stirring, until the prawns are pink and the tofu starts to colour, then push these to the side of the pan along with the noodles. 7 Add the eggs Pour the eggs into the wok, then break the yolks with your spatula, or whatever implement you\u2019re using to stir-fry. Once the eggs are beginning to set on the bottom of the pan, scramble them roughly and cook until they separate into dry curds. 8 Bring together and serve Push the noodles, tofu and prawns back into the middle of the wok and add the radish (if using), dried shrimp, beansprouts, chives and peanuts. Toss together, until everything is well combined, then serve up either in individual portions or on one big platter, along with the garnishes for diners to add as they wish. 9 And to veganise\u2026 This is an easy dish to make vegan, if that\u2019s your preference: fish sauce substitutes are fairly widely available these days (as are gluten-free ones, incidentally), and you can add extra tofu to make up for the animal products (scrambled soft tofu can stand in for the eggs), or add a vegetable of your choice instead, cooking or blanching it first, if need be."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
