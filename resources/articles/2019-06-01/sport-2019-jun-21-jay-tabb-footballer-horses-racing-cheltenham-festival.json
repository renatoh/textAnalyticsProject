His day began more than four hours ago, as it does every morning here during a 12-week foundation course, which he has nearly completed, by getting up to go for a half-hour run in a sweat suit to ensure he meets the 11st weight limit \u2013 inclusive of skullcap, body protector and boots. Tabb, a professional footballer in his previous life, jumps on the scales in the offices to double-check. \u201cI don\u2019t want to not ride basically,\u201d he says. On a sunny day in South Yorkshire, in the grounds of Rossington Hall and where peacocks roam, the 5ft 4in former Reading midfielder, who retired from football three years ago, explains swapping shin pads for saddle pads with a smile. The chipper instructors, former jockeys Philip Varley and Lee Swift, chivvy the students, including Tabb \u2013 whose hands are weathered and blistered from mucking out and \u201cbeing keen as mustard\u201d to sweep the yard during his first days on the programme \u2013 as he wraps tendon boots around the horse\u2019s legs, having applied the bridle, girth and stirrups. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy how quickly you progress,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew nothing. I couldn\u2019t pick a horse\u2019s feet; I couldn\u2019t put a head collar on or anything like that. I did a bit of research online, came up here for an open day, an interview, and it went from there. I get stuff right and I get stuff wrong every day but the main thing is I\u2019m learning. It sounds a bit soppy but when you first stroke a horse, it\u2019s just a really nice feeling.\u201d For Tabb this is not about becoming a jockey \u2013 \u201cthe reality is I\u2019m 35 and coming into it very late\u201d \u2013 but he is serious about working in racing and trading life in west London for the Somerset countryside. Tabb, who graduates from the college this week, has been accepted to work at the trainer Philip Hobbs\u2019s yard in Minehead, where he will begin his level two apprenticeship and, down the line, he hopes to ride in a charity race. \u201cWhen you watch racing, you think: \u2018How has he not won there? How has he fallen there?\u2019 But, until you sit on a racehorse yourself, you are never going to respect a jockey like you should do because they are putting their lives on the line and they have to be a lot fitter than you think. People look at jockeys and see them as being small and skinny, and think \u2018Oh, anyone can do it\u2019 but it is really hard to give a horse a good ride. My respect levels for jockeys have gone through the roof.\u201d Since Ben Turner, a former roommate at Coventry City, piqued Tabb\u2019s interest by putting racing on TV after training, his love for the sport has snowballed. They co-own Mister Miyagi, a 10-year-old trained by Stuart Edmunds that has twice won at Cheltenham, giving Tabb a taste of the winners\u2019 enclosure. \u201cI\u2019ve been there and soaked up the buzz so that\u2019s why the dream would be to ride in one of the amateur races at the Festival. It\u2019s unreal; it\u2019s such an amazing place. There are hundreds, thousands of amateur jockeys across the country and if you said: \u2018What would you like to do?\u2019 I bet they would all say the same thing. It is not just something you go and do. I am right at the bottom of the pecking order at the moment in terms of who deserves it as well, but you never know.\u201d Between retiring and racing college Tabb played rugby with his brother, Harry, and worked as a labourer with his father, Tony, fitting bathrooms and renovating houses, as well as caddying for Lauren Horsford on the Ladies European Tour. But all along he was keen to pursue his passion for racing and when his mother, Sharon, died, he became more reluctant to let the grass grow under his feet. \u201cI\u2019m glad that I have come to learn how to ride a horse, because you can put things off. I just thought: \u2018Life\u2019s too short, I\u2019m not enjoying football, I do have other interests,\u2019 so it was the right time to do it. My mum would have been exactly the same as my auntie, crying her eyes out if she had seen me on a horse. Even when she came and watched me play football, if someone hit me too hard she would be really annoyed and be like: \u2018What are they doing to my baby?\u2019\u201d Eight years ago last month Tabb was preparing for a Championship play-off final and although he loved his career, especially when Coventry beat Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s Manchester United at Old Trafford, his appetite for the game faded. \u201cI always kind of thought once I finished, that that was one sort of life and now this is a different one,\u201d he says. Does he miss football? \u201cNo, in a word. I do check the results \u2013 I know who\u2019s struggling and who\u2019s not \u2013 but not every Saturday.\u201d After hours on a simulator and in the indoor school, Tabb is leading the string out on the gallops, gliding through the gears \u2013 from a walk to a trot and a controlled canter, between 15-20mph. Instructors have been impressed with Tabb\u2019s horsemanship and his discipline on Daaweitza, his next ride. \u201cThe set-off is going to have to be spot-on, the contact is going to have be right,\u201d he says with a zip in his voice, brushing down a horse that earned almost \u00a3100,000 in its heyday. \u201cHe likes having a fight \u2013 but there\u2019s only one winner. He\u2019s the boss, he\u2019s in charge and it\u2019s a testing ride, but it\u2019s nice they put a bit of trust in me to ride him. It does feel a bit surreal. It\u2019s like: \u2018Is this actually me doing this?\u2019\u201d After bringing Damien, a half-brother to Daaweitza and his final lot, back into the yard, it is time for a brisk salad before round two of grooming, mucking out, washing down and feeding the horses. What do his former teammates and managers make of it? \u201cWally Downes, who gave me my debut at Brentford [in 2001] messaged me saying \u2018well done\u2019. I think most people didn\u2019t think I would actually do it so they just say \u2018fair play\u2019. \u201cIn a way, you have to just pretend to be confident, or pretend to think: \u2018This isn\u2019t a racehorse that could just take off at any minute and I wouldn\u2019t be able to stop it.\u2019 As soon as I got here, I said to myself: \u2018I\u2019m going to do this, I\u2019m going to learn how to ride a horse, how to muck out.\u2019 I\u2019ve just faked it a bit,\u201d he adds with a broad smile."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
