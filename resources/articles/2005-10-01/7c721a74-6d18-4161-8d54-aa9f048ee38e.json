Jared Borgetti scored his second goal for the club following his summer move from Mexico, cancelling out the opener from Ailton. \"I'm delighted with the performance overall,\" said Allardyce, who made seven changes to the side beaten 5-1 by Chelsea at the weekend. \"We gave away a stupid goal but I thought we did extremely well after that. In the second half we smothered them in terms of attacking flair.\" Kleberson worked the first opening for the Turks in the fourth minute, sending in a cross which was headed over by Ailton but the same player found the target soon after, when Tal Ben Haim played a bad ball, Tumer Metin released Ailton and he thumped a shot beyond Ian Walker. Bolton came right back into the game, Khalilou Fadiga almost pulling them level with a 20-yard effort which the goalkeeper did well to tip over. They equalised a few minutes later, when Borgetti got on the end of a fine cross from El Hadji Diouf. Hidetoshi Nakata then found himself clear, only for his effort to be blocked, and Besiktas looked rattled as Diouf sent a shot narrowly wide. The small number of visiting fans became more vocal while the home crowd's frustration grew but the Turkish team began the second half in positive mood and Ibrahim Akin fired in a 20-yard shot which cleared the bar before Fadiga got in the way of the same player's effort to divert it to safety. Kevin Nolan came on before the hour, Bolton kept up the momentum and Fadiga delivered a free-kick that Abdoulaye Faye might have made more of. Diouf did find the net in the 70th minute but it was rightly disallowed for offside."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
