If so, Scots of whatever generation will wince as poor Haffey's butterfingered \"ignominy\" 40 Aprils ago is recalled. England won 9-3. Saunders had continued: \"As Haynes was borne in triumph off the Wembley pitch by jubilant colleagues, Haffey set out, head bowed, alone, on the long journey to the welcome darkness of the tunnel.\" It was understandable poetic licence from the press-box eyrie. The truth seems to be that Haffey put his afternoon's experience down solely to the commanding resplendence of Haynes and his artful lieutenant Jimmy Greaves, who scored a hat-trick. Those closer to the action reported the unfazed goalkeeper in his canary yellow jersey to be whistling unconcernedly as he made his way from that sunlit field. Once in the communal post-match bath, by all accounts, the strapping Celtic fellow began to serenade his mortified colleagues with some traditional Harry Lauder numbers - until young Denis Law angrily demanded he pipe down: \"Don't you realise you've just been responsible for Scottish football's most appalling catastrophe?\" As their coach took them from the stadium, negotiating its path through jeering tartan-clad supporters along Wembley Way, the rest of the Scotland team ducked below the window level in shame - all except the still uncomprehending Haffey, curly brown hair accentuating the grin on his square, friendly face. When the team boarded the train at King's Cross, Haffey was happy to enter into the spirit of things when Fleet Street photographers invited him to pose, arms outstretched, under a large sign that read platform \"NINE\". By the time the night sleeper reached Glasgow, the Sunday newspaper billboards told the big engaging goalkeeper where blame was being apportioned. SLAP HAFFEY said one, HAPLESS HAFFEY another - and in spite of such legendary predecessors in the lore as Harry Rennie, John Thomson and Jimmy Cowan, Scotland's reputation for insecure goalkeeping took root there and then. The deprecating national joke, which one can still hear sometimes today among football folk, was minted for posterity: \"What's the time?\" \"Almost 10-past Haffey.\" At Wembley Celtic's popular \"Big Frank\" had been fourth choice anyway, an eleventh-hour international summons following injuries to Bill Brown (Tottenham Hotspur), Lawrie Leslie (Airdrieonians) and Ronnie Simpson (Hibernian). Thereafter Haffey concentrated on a professional singing career before emigrating, with it, to Australia. Last week I repeatedly tried to reach him by telephone at his Adelaide home, but with no success. Perhaps he was shrewdly aware of the only anniversary reason a stranger might be calling from an English newspaper. A Glasgow acquaintance did, however, speak to him a few months ago and reported him full of the joys and still in bonny good voice. Hindsight has also shifted the blame for that perceived Scottish debacle. For instance, it was too easy to forget that the England team of 1960-61 was one of the finest ever, its forward line genuine vintage. At Wembley England fielded: Springett; Armfield, McNeil; Robson, Swan, Flowers; Douglas, Greaves, Smith, Haynes, Charlton. In that period, ending with a defeat in Vienna, England's record was P8, W7, D1, with an astonishing 44 goals for and 11 against. In the 1960-61 Home Championship they scored a record 19 goals. The right-back Jimmy Armfield, now a BBC radio sage, says: \"It must have been one of England's all-time best, certainly going forward. The runners and strikers were inspired by the endless stream of wonderful passes from Haynes and Bobby Robson. After running riot that day at Wembley, we beat Mexico by 8-0 but then injuries weighed in and the selectors began tinkering; else I seriously think we'd have won the World Cup in Chile the following year.\" Armfield absolves Haffey for Scotland's failure. \"He might have made a couple of mistakes but not half as many as the defenders around him. It is always too easy to blame your keeper.\" Haynes, England's maestro that day, now lives happily in, of all places, Edinburgh. He agrees: \"The goalie might have stopped a couple but we'd have run amok whoever was in goal. These things happen, it all comes together and a team suddenly starts purring; we hit five in about 10 minutes and, with Jimmy [Greaves] in that groove, we'd have beaten any team anywhere. \"In fact, it was very competitive till we hit that purple patch. Then even the best keeper in the world wouldn't have denied us, not even if Banks and Schmeichel had been in there together.\" Forty years on that's exoneration enough for the \"hapless\" troubadour Haffey. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
