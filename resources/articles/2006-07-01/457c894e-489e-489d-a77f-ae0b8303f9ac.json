The daft French thriller District 13, from a script by Luc Besson, could well have been entitled The Running, Jumping &amp; Blowing Things Up Film. David Belle, originator of the urban leaping craze 'le parkour', is best known to British audiences as the high-flying star of those rooftop-jumping BBC ads. Here, he flips, flops and flies through the dystopian near-future landscape of the titular Parisian ghetto. The premise, wantonly ripped off from John Carpenter's Escape From New York, sets a cop and a convict battling their way through the walled-off banlieue in search of a stolen weapon of mass destruction. Besson throws some glib political subtextuality into the mix (the government has abandoned the ghettos), capitalising upon the real-life unrest which recently made international news. But it's the punching, shooting and bouncing off walls which provide the only real point of interest, with a pay-off lecture about violence not solving anything (after 85 minutes of bullet-spraying fun) provoking hollow laughter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
