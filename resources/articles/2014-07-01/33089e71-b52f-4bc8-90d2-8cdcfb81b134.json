We simply cannot overstate his importance to the side, nor the psychological effects his absence will have on his team-mates. Before this World Cup I obviously expected him to play a huge part and to be one of the players that could finish the tournament as one of the most improved players. You could see Neymar had a great World Cup in his sights by the way he used his first club season in Europe to watch and learn. It gave me great hope that this would be a great tournament. That all changed with Juan Camilo Z\u00fa\u00f1iga\u2019s cowardly challenge. I am not accusing the Colombian player of deliberately taking Neymar out of the tournament or causing such a serious injury. But he went knee-high with that tackle. His intention was to whack Neymar. It happened right in front of the referee and I was livid that there was no reaction. I believe Fifa should act strongly and punish Z\u00fa\u00f1iga in the same heavy way that it treated Luis Su\u00e1rez. This kind of tackle has no place in the game. I am absolutely saddened by the news and I sent Neymar and his family my commiserations on his injury. He will bounce back and is young enough to play in more World Cups but to miss the chance of playing a semi-final at home against Germany must be heartbreaking for him. But Fifa is also to blame for deciding to turn a blind eye to a lot of fouling in this tournament. I have observed in many matches that professional fouls are being ignored by referees and that there\u2019s a lot of grabbing going on. I had the chance to meet the Fifa referee commission\u2019s director, Massimo Busacca, and he told me the aim was to avoid being too harsh in punishments in order to not spoil the spectacle. Players, however, have seized the opportunity and they are getting away with it. Before anybody accuses me of being partial, let me say I was angry at the way Brazil players were taking turns to foul James Rodr\u00edguez in Friday\u2019s game. A more rigorous referee could have sent Fernandinho off in the first half. What now for Brazil, though? They will have to gather energy and strength from somewhere to stay in this competition. Brazil had become too dependent on Neymar\u2019s individual moments and that became quite clear in the group stages. None of the collective organisation that was so important for the team in the Confederations Cup last year was present in the World Cup and Neymar bailed them out big time against Croatia and Cameroon. But the funny thing is that he was quiet in the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o\u2019s two knockout games, especially the one against Colombia, in which he didn\u2019t really have an impact and only one shot on goal. That must be the lesson for Brazil to take to the Germany game on Tuesday. Brazil showed against the Colombians that they could also play when Neymar wasn\u2019t really there. Colombia did a great job of cutting off his space but Brazil managed to compensate for that with a great team performance in the first half, their best 45 minutes in the competition so far. The team marked well and created chances. If Hulk had been a bit more accurate with his finishing Brazil could have gone in at half-time with at least three goals. In the second half things got trickier but we must give Colombia some credit. They increased the pace and caused Brazil some problems and the fact they made it to the quarter-finals should be a positive for them. For Brazil, they should remember it is a team that wins a World Cup and rarely have individuals been able to carry a team to a title. Brazil can draw lessons from 1962, when Pel\u00e9 got injured quite early in the competition and they still became the last nation to defend the title successfully. Some people will immediately point out they had Garrincha and Didi in that side, experienced World Cup players who could step in \u2013 and it was the youngster Amarildo who stole the show scoring vital goals. But nobody in the country was really sure they could do it. Now the current Sele\u00e7\u00e3o must prepare for a semi-final against Germany. They need to regroup and get organised for what was always going to be a tough match, even if Neymar were still available. There are weapons at hand. Against Germany the main battle will be in midfield and I think Brazil should deploy three more combative midfielders that could disrupt the German passing. Fred remains a problem and, after having five games to show what he is made of, it\u2019s time to think of alternatives. Oscar has been disappointing and he needs to step up and help. In my mind, fast players like Willian and Bernard need to be considered and I am inclined to think the Chelsea midfielder looks a better alternative for the job on Tuesday in Belo Horizonte. Most of all, the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o have to remember they are playing a World Cup semi-final at home and that they will have to pull together. I am in no doubt that the crowd will be willing to push them and the fact that Germany haven\u2019t really set the competition alight either will be a good reminder that Brazil have a chance. This is Brazil \u2013 and they are unlike any other team. I don\u2019t think for a minute that Germany will be relishing this game. Above all, the Brazilian players have a chance to draw energy from Neymar\u2019s sacrifice. He has been tremendous for them in the last four years and they owe him a performance full of heart and fight on Tuesday. They need to leave their souls on the pitch as a tribute for this kid whose dreams have been shattered because of one horrific tackle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
