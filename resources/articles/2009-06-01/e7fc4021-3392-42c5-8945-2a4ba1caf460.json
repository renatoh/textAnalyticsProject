The average price of a home in England and Wales stayed at \u00a3155,600, researchers at Hometrack said, citing rising sales volumes and a higher number of buyer registrations along with a dwindling supply of housing. Price falls were recorded in just 3% of postcodes, down from 32% in April and about 60% at the start of the year, while the annual rate of decline eased to 8.7% in June from 9.6% in May. The survey said that demand for housing in London and the south-east had been particularly strong, rising 52% and 46% respectively over the first half of the year. The increase in Wales over the same period was just 19%, with 20% recorded in the north-east. Recent data about the housing market has painted an uncertain picture, with tentative signs of a recovery from the heavy falls of the past two years. Nationwide and Halifax both recorded an increase in prices for May, but last week the property website Rightmove reported a dip in June after four months of gradual improvement. Meanwhile, separate figures out today showed that the average price of a house sold at auction has plunged by more than 35% from its peak in mid-2007. The Essential Information Group, property auction specialists, revealed that the average price of a house sold at auction fell 18.8% from March to May compared with the same period a year earlier. The average price now stands at \u00a3143,032. Prices in the north fell by 21% in this period as did prices in the Midlands and Wales. London is faring far better with prices slipping just 5% in this period."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
