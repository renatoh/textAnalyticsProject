Under Takeover Panel rules, Pfizer has four weeks from first tabling a takeover proposal to \"put up or shut up\" \u2013 make a firm bid or walk away for six months. The four-week deadline expires on Monday. Leif Johansson, AstraZeneca's Swedish chairman, started hammering the nails into the deal's coffin last week when he released a statement to make it \"absolutely clear\" that it was legally impossible for Pfizer to increase its \"final\" \u00a355-a-share offer, which AstraZeneca's board has categorically rejected. But despite Johansson's statement, Pfizer has continued to try to provoke revolt among AstraZeneca shareholders \u2013 with some success. Most prominently, Axa Investment Managers has called on the company to put the \u00a355-a-share offer to investors. \"Many shareholders \u2013 but not necessarily all \u2013 will find this an attractive offer,\" said Jim Stride, the head of UK equities at Axa Investment Managers. Stride is right: some investors \u2013 include Schroders and Jupiter Fund Management \u2013 do regard \u00a355 as a good deal, but a much greater proportion of shareholders want more money. These investors are split into two camps. The first \u2013 which includes Fidelity, Sweden's Investor AB, M&amp;G, Threadneedle and well-known fund manager Neil Woodford \u2013 have publicly backed AstraZeneca's management in rejecting the bid. Woodford, who controls a \u00a3350m stake in AstraZeneca on behalf of wealth managers St James's Place, applauded the board for its \"resolute resistance\" to Pfizer's overtures. \"I remain convinced that an independent AstraZeneca will achieve far better returns for its shareholders than the combination of cash and Pfizer paper would have delivered,\" he said. \"The long-term future for AstraZeneca looks very bright indeed.\" The second camp is perhaps more interesting. While it hasn't spoken out publicly, this group, which includes AstraZeneca's biggest investor, BlackRock, has been lobbying hard behind the scenes for a third option. These shareholders agree with AstraZeneca's management that \u00a355 isn't enough, but they are angry at the company for failing to get around the table and extract a higher price. They want AstraZeneca to start fresh talks with Pfizer: and if they get their way fresh negotiations could start in three months, rather than the minimum six-month period Pfizer must leave if not invited to re-approach. A source close to Pfizer said it was optimistic there was enough disquiet among shareholders to force AstraZeneca to restart talks. \"We're not able to re-approach for six months, but with sufficient shareholder pressure, AstraZeneca could re-initiate,\" the source said. BlackRock is important because as well as being AstraZeneca's biggest investor, with an 8% stake, it is also one of the biggest shareholders in Pfizer. The US pharma company, which discovered Viagra at its now-scaled-down laboratories in Kent, appears willing to raise its bid despite declaring the \u00a355-a-share approach was final. It has already increased its offer four times since it first went to AstraZeneca in January, lifting the price from \u00a346.61. Johansson has said the board would consider an offer at \u00a358.85 a share. The bookmaker Ladbrokes is offering odds of 3/1 for the takeover to be completed before Monday, and 5/4 for a deal to happen in a future offer period. Restarting talks would prove embarrassing to Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca's chief executive, who has ferociously defended the company from a takeover that could have seen him collect a personal windfall of up to \u00a331m. Soriot's defence extended to an emotive warning to MPs that disruption caused by what would be the biggest-ever foreign takeover of a British firm could end up costing the lives of cancer patients. \"Any distractions on work we are doing now could run the risk of delaying our drugs pipeline,\" he said. \"From the lab to the patient takes many years. \"What will we tell the person whose father died from lung cancer because one of our medicines was delayed \u2013 and essentially was delayed because in the meantime our two companies were involved in saving tax and saving costs? \"It is logical to assume that a merger like this could mean substantial cost savings, and cost savings could mean job losses.\" The company's latest drugs, including the cancer immunology drug MEDI4736, which could be a \u00a33.9bn moneyspinner, will be unveiled at the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in Chicago next weekend. The development of the drug \u2013 a human monoclonal antibody which helps the body's own defences target cancer cells \u2013 is so important to AstraZeneca that Soriot will fly to Chicago to oversee the presentation. However, sources close to him say the French-Australian expects to spend as much time at the conference fending off shareholders keen to talk about the deal as he will talking to doctors."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
