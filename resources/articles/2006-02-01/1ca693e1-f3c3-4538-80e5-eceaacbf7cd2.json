Their second meeting in three days with Crystal Palace ended 2-0. Preston consequently swapped places with Palace, moving up from sixth to fifth. Brett Ormerod, their debutant, and Brian O'Neil scored the goals. Preston are now five points clear of seventh-placed Cardiff who drew 1-1 with struggling Millwall. The two teams directly above Millwall increased the Londoners' worries by pulling further clear of them: Brighton secured a useful point at home to Burnley, drawing 0-0, and Leicester won 3-2 at QPR In League One, Swansea's automatic promotion hopes took a blow when they lost 2-1 at home against lowly Gillingham. Swindon's relegation worries were eased as they extended their unbeaten home run to five, winning 1-0 win against Walsall. League Two's relegation six-pointer between Stockport and Torquay ended 1-1 while leaders Wycombe failed to overcome Northampton, drawing 0-0."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
