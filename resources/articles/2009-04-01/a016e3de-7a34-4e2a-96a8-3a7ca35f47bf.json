Keyhole surgery is scheduled for next week, but elsewhere the knives will already be out. All those who questioned the sanity of Flintoff's IPL jaunt so close to a packed England summer, including the Twenty20 World Cup and an Ashes series, will feel vindicated in saying: \"I told you so\". Flintoff will be accused of putting cash ahead of country \u2013 politely so because he remains a national icon \u2013 and the England and Wales Cricket Board will be pilloried for not intervening to stop him. There could be such a public outcry that the bankers might even get the weekend off. \"It could have happened crossing the road,\" was the defiant response from the ECB yesterday. That might be true at Lord's, where anyone leaving by the North Gate is faced by one of the most dangerous zebra crossings in London, but such fatalism will not resonate elsewhere. Flintoff is injured again, England are wearing that vulnerable look, and resentment is sure to follow. The fact is, though, that this injury could have happened on any cricket field at anytime, especially to Flintoff. The biggest surprise yesterday was to discover that there is still cartilage to repair. He has had so many operations one could assume he would have had them all whipped out years ago. Getting him on the field has long been like reassembling an Ikea wardrobe with half the bolts missing. \"He has been injured playing cricket \u2013 that's what we do, play cricket,\" a senior England player said yesterday. His fatalism was understandable. Considering Flintoff's fitness record, it would have been irresponsible if he had been injured on a dry ski slope, or leaving a nightclub, or even running for a bus, but all he was doing was his job. To argue that he should have been prevented from doing that job, especially when Chennai were willing to pay a record \u00a31.1m for his services, is to expect the impossible. The ECB came to understand, reluctantly in some cases, that they were powerless to prevent England's players from sampling the IPL. They might hold Flintoff's contract, but central contracts, as rewritten after months of negotiations, do not give them an unchallengeable right to run his life when England are not playing. He is 31, a professional cricketer at the height of his powers, and wanted the same rights to play in the IPL as the world's other leading players. His agent, the Professional Cricketers' Association and as many legal representatives as might prove necessary, were bent upon protecting such rights for as long as it took. What the ECB could insist upon was medical safeguards for all England's players in the IPL and in Flintoff's case those safeguards have worked remarkably well; the speed of the response perhaps unprecedented. Flintoff complained of soreness in his right knee on Thursday after Chennai's defeat against Delhi, Chennai contacted the ECB and arranged an immediate scan, the England selectors were alerted that evening, the ECB's chief medical officer, Nick Peirce, ruled that he must return home for an operation, and return he has. All in a matter of hours. In football, clubs have long held sway. Players \u2013 especially foreign players \u2013 do not have to be injured for Premier League managers to rail about their international commitments, merely to be tired after a long-haul flight is sin enough. In cricket, central contracts were intended to give England complete power, but the IPL has tipped the balance back towards the clubs. The fact that clubs are Indian franchises is just how it is. It might even work out rather well. Flintoff is spared a Test and one-day series against West Indies, where the risk of injury would have been just as high. An estimated recovery period of four to five weeks takes England to late May, leaving him just enough time for a couple of exploratory T20 matches for Lancashire, a Twenty20 World Cup warm-up against Scotland at Trent Bridge on 2 June and what should be a comfortable opening match against the Netherlands at Lord's on 5 June. The overriding response towards this IPL misadventure should not be resentment, but compassion. If you drew up a medical chart of his injuries there would not be enough room for all the arrows; there is barely a part of his body that has not been battered into submission. Flintoff batters his frame into the turf, the consequences are potentially crippling. Compensating for one injury only brings another. He has become a cricketer without shock absorbers. This is just another shock, a shock that English cricket has no choice but to absorb with him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
