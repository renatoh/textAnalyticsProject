They proposed nothing less than \u201crevolution, girl-style, now\u201d. They stared down misogyny with playground taunts and believed in creating an alternative to mainstream culture (and \u201calternative\u201d music, for that matter) by foregrounding participation, not virtuosity. But Bikini Kill rocked, too, making for a tight four-piece, reminiscent of Washington DC hardcore legends Minor Threat fronted by Poly Styrene of X-Ray Spex: loud and fast, sarcastic and confrontational, equal parts burning sincerity and goofy charm. The first of two nights in this large south London venue, bigger than any they ever played in their first incarnation, retains all those hallmarks. Hanging like a miasma over the simple stage \u2013 there are lights, and that\u2019s it \u2013 is the weight of expectation of a generation of fans too young to have seen their heroes the first time. Kathleen Hanna \u2013 Bikini Kill\u2019s singer \u2013 does ironic calisthenics to warm up. Her voice is the clincher: there is nothing missing tonight from the singer\u2019s repertoire of thuggish cheerleader chants and snarled hollers, sung sections and punk gabble. If the term \u201chairdryer treatment\u201d were not already in use for football managers, it would be a suitably female-adjacent description of what it\u2019s like to stand in front of Hanna in full flow. Feels Blind, an early song about alienation, and how women\u2019s perceptions are routinely gaslit, begins with melody and prettiness. It swiftly rises to a holler. \u201cHow does it feel? It feels blind!\u201d she bellows, magnified by effects on her vocals and Brixton\u2019s notoriously echoey sound system. Bikini Kill are actually louder tonight than in the 90s, but they remain, resolutely, themselves. Drummer, sometime vocalist and ideological hub Tobi Vail sings Hamster Baby and Tell Me So, just like she did on their Pussy Whipped album (1993). She later explains one of the band\u2019s learn-by-doing strategies with reference to Bertolt Brecht. Kathi Wilcox (mostly bass) wields her instrument while wearing a chic vintage-looking cocktail dress and an expression of amusement. Missing is original guitarist Billy Karren, who doesn\u2019t do reunions, replaced by long-time punk activist Erica Dawn Lyle. Bikini Kill are well rehearsed, and 20 years more comfortable with their instruments than they were in their 90s heyday. But their outpourings of frustration, pain and challenge have not mellowed. It is an anguished truism to say that they have returned to a political climate heading backwards, with abortion rights curtailed in red states and the pussy-grabber-in-chief in the White House eyeing a second term. #MeToo happened, prompting the kind of female solidarity that used to happen in riot grrrl fanzines before the internet. Songs from Bikini Kill\u2019s two albums, one EP and one demo tape whip by in a blur of juddering righteousness. Opener New Radio begins with typical defiance: \u201cI\u2019m the little girl at the picnic who won\u2019t stop pulling her dress up,\u201d yells Hanna. In The Punk Singer, a revealing 2013 documentary about her life, Hanna recalls being promised ice-cream by her father after a childhood performance, then shamed for being a show-off. His other abusive behaviours provided much of the fuel for Hanna\u2019s awakening into women\u2019s advocacy. \u201cDaddy comes into her room at night,\u201d goes Suck My Left One, a rallying cry from Bikini Kill\u2019s first EP, delivered near the end. But crucially Hanna\u2019s \u2013 and Bikini Kill\u2019s, and riot grrrl\u2019s \u2013 feminism was rooted in female freeness: in the joy of prancing about, the lack of shame at stripping for money. And Hanna\u2019s watchability \u2013 her karate chops, and 60s dances, how she points to her breasts (\u201cthere are my tits!\u201d) and bends over to show her behind (\u201cthis is my ass!\u201d) for Lil\u2019 Red, a rewriting of the Red Riding Hood story \u2013 thrills twice over. Seeing freeness enacted is intoxicating and enabling once again, and it finds Hanna physically fit after nearly a decade battling a condition eventually diagnosed as Lyme disease. Later on in the gig, Hanna recalls how one women-only show in a pub was interrupted by women wanting to ask a question \u2013 how could Hanna be a feminist if she had been a stripper? Hanna remembers Vail answering on her behalf, because she was too upset. Tonight, Hanna is clear: \u201cIt\u2019s not a flaw not to be a perfect feminist,\u201d she says after Reject All American, the title track of their second album (1996), and before Alien She, \u201cStop judging other people\u2019s feminism!\u201d If anything, this second coming of Bikini Kill feels slightly odd because everyone is so happy. The band were sometimes attacked, verbally and physically, not just by angry women, but by angry men \u2013 punks who did not take well to being told to stand at the back of the room (\u201cWomen to the front\u201d was a rallying cry). When Bikini Kill broke up in 1997, they were exhausted from all this, and \u2013 ironically, given their message of solidarity \u2013 not the best of friends. Living on next to nothing, coping with running an unconventional band, even for punk, without management, took a toll. They scattered; Wilcox moved to Washington, walked dogs and eventually worked for the Washington Post, played in the Frumpies. Vail remained in Olympia, Washington, the band\u2019s birthplace, to continue with punk activism. It was Vail who precipitated this reunion. Due to perform solo at a 2017 book launch in New York, Vail aired the idea of collaborating with Wilcox and, eventually, Hanna, who had had an afterlife of her own, with the Julie Ruin and Le Tigre. The three shared a small stage for a run-through of For Tammy Rae \u2013 the song they play in tonight\u2019s final encore \u2013 galvanising speculation that a more meaningful reunion might be on the cards. That this reunion is meaningful is in no doubt. Two nights in London have followed sell-out runs in Los Angeles and New York; there are festivals to play. A kind of revolutionary girl-style punk protest was attempted in Russia by Pussy Riot, direct ideological descendants of Bikini Kill. When it comes, Rebel Girl \u2013 Bikini Kill\u2019s anthem \u2013 is met with a huge outpouring of happiness at the \u201cqueens of the neighbourhood\u201d being back in action. But it is a sign of the times that phones spring up where once there would have been crowd-surfers. A blistering Double Dare Ya, in the encore, is their other cri de coeur: \u201cDare you to be who you want,\u201d Hanna bellows; advice I took her up on at a tender age. Glory and yachts were not on the list of demands on the riot grrl manifesto, but the price the band paid for their fearlessness was considerable. After the breakup, Hanna went to North Carolina and worked in data entry. Six years in one of the most exciting and visceral punk bands ever had left her with only $400 to her name. Even if Bikini Kill had only got back together for the money \u2013 and they clearly haven\u2019t \u2013 it would have been worth it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
