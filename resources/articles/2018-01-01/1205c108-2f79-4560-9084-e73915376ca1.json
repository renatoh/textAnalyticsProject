New forensic DNA evidence has proved that Joanne Hayes was not the mother of a child known as \u201cBaby John\u201d, whose remains were found at a beauty spot on the southwest Irish coastline in 1984. The acting head of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, D\u00f3nall \u00d3 Cual\u00e1in, telephoned and wrote to Hayes to apologise for the error. Supt Flor Murphy said that the force was reopening the investigation into the child\u2019s death, who was found with stab wounds by a jogger on the beach. Speaking at Caherciveen Garda station, close to the spot where the baby\u2019s body was discovered, Murphy said that, following the new DNA evidence, a murder inquiry would \u201cstart from scratch\u201d. He said: \u201cIt is a matter of significant regret for An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na that it has taken such a long time for it to be confirmed that Ms Hayes is not the mother of Baby John. \u201cOn behalf of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, I would like to sincerely apologise to Ms Hayes for that, as well as the awful stress and pain she has been put through as a result of the original investigation into this matter, which fell well short of the required standards.\u201d The treatment of Hayes as a suspect by the Garda\u00ed angered local people as well as women\u2019s rights groups across Ireland at the time. At one stage, investigating detectives wrongly assumed that Hayes had given birth to twins, one of whom had died and was buried on the family\u2019s farm. The other, they wrongly concluded, was Baby John, whom they believed she had killed. The DNA evidence released on Tuesday has proved that Hayes was not the mother of Baby John. The baby\u2019s remains are interred at Holy Cross cemetery in Caherciveen. Murphy said that a \u201csample has been examined and compared, and as a result of this analysis, we can conclusively state that Joanne Hayes is not the mother of Baby John\u201d. The Hayes family alleged in the 1980s that they had been coerced into originally making what turned out to be false admissions over involvement in the death of Baby John. Hayes and her family have yet to comment on the confirmation that she was not the mother of the murdered baby."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
