Now, as you know, men are traditionally not given to overt displays of mutual affection, especially in public, probably for fear of looking too wet, vulnerable, sentimental and hence weak. I personally learnt hugging was OK from my dad, himself a 'real' man among men - who used to get hold of me and give me a full-on, breath-stalling bear hug every day when he came home from work and continued to do so whenever we met until he died last year. So for me, it has never been a problem to greet another man I feel love for with a hug. In fact, I tend to give all my close friends, family members and even some business associates with whom I'm close a warm hug and a kiss on the cheek, sometimes both. Occasionally I weaken and through a moment of shyness or fear of being seen too familiar might punctuate the hug with a bit of back-slapping - mostly to allay any discomfort the other might feel about such intimacy - sometimes I go as far to play out an entertaining, almost entrancing, short rhythmic pattern of some complexity, such as a paradiddle or accented roll with my palms on their upper back. There are times I even go for the new-fangled, fist-to-fist, left front shoulder to left front shoulder, with brief, light slap-on-the-back move favoured in certain hip-hop circles. But it's the full chest-to-chest affair that hits the spot for me, without the added distracting manly slap on the back, because there's nothing that transmits human warmth quite as effectively. Because touch - other than for shaking hands, having sex, medical examinations, helping someone cross the road, ballroom dancing or officially giving a massage or healing - tends to be anathematic here, I wonder if this increase in hugging is a result of watching American movies and TV series such as Sex and the City, as hugging in its new incarnation is essentially an American import, its origins dating back to the Californian encounter groups of the Sixties, where two guys with ponytails on meeting would hug and say earnestly, 'I love you, man.' I had a new-age style friend when I lived in New Mexico in the late Seventies, who would engage me in an overly long hug whenever we met, and end it by holding me away a few inches, looking into my eyes, taking a deep breath and going, 'Mmm' in acknowledgement of the divine in me meeting the divine in him - after a while it got so spiritually gloopy saying hello, I actually started avoiding him. But I do believe if more of us got into hugging people we liked, it would make the world a warmer place for all of us, and so am here today to proselytise the cause of the hug and humbly offer instructions should you be out of practice and wish to experiment with it. The perfect hug is best instigated by taking the initiative and opening your arms in a wide-open embrace on reaching approximately 5ft distance from the person you're greeting. This signals your intent and gives them the option to duck out by offering you their right hand to shake instead. Providing they go with the invite, however, you'll notice them open their arms in response. Closing the distance, it becomes a simple matter to negotiate the placement of arms. Next, position your chest so that the centre of both your breastbones meet. This is where the warmth is transmitted. Put your hips into it as well, otherwise you look a bit daft with both your bums pulling away from each other. As soon as sufficient warmth has been transmitted, pull away gently - don't linger like my new age friend - and without embarrassment, carry on as you were. \u00b7 Manifesto: The Internal Revolution by Barefoot Doctor is published by Thorsons at \u00a312.To order a copy for \u00a310 plus p&amp;p, call the Observer Book Service on 0870 836 0885"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
