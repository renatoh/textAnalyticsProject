I can't bear to look", "bodyText": "How I remember the day when I bounded up to my desk at another newspaper and, after some beginning-of-the-day chitchat, I turned to my colleague Mike and said: \"Oh yes and I've found a really good new search engine.\" Mike looked interested and grabbed a pen and a Post-it note. If you've subsequently mislaid it, Mike, allow me to pass on that name again: it's a little website you may have heard of called Google. I thought of that moment last week and my Google epiphany, my first encounter with all that clean, white space and instant results and the first rush of having what seemed like access to everything (think Renton on the heroin in Trainspotting). Because there's a new Google epiphany waiting to happen, but one that I'm not sure I want: Google Glass. Google's 1,000 hand-picked \"explorers\" have been sending back reports from this brave new world and last week came the first proper shots and video of what the world looks like through the lens. Amazing, but a bit scary. Like Blade Runner but without the possibility of having sex with a replicant. Or at least not yet. Basically, it's the world, with added instant information right there, in front of you, hovering overhead. Want to know what that building is? Or when it was built? Or who by? Want to talk to your chum on Skype while walking down the street? Want to bring up the lyrics of the Welsh national anthem while simultaneously checking your emails and reading about Gwyneth Paltrow's abdominal crunches? No, OK, that's just me then. Because I am not strong enough for Google Glass. I am weak-willed. I am distractible. I wander off. It used to be called daydreaming, but with added technology it's more like paranoia. I can get lost in the thicket of a Google trail, leapfrogging from some snippet of information to a YouTube video, to Mail Online, to a Google map, to some random Twitter feed, to Mail Online. Have I mentioned Mail Online? For those of us who grew up in a world where there wasn't much information, you had to glean small nuggets of it from a whole selection of unlikely and not very good sources. These ranged from Nationwide (like The One Show, young folk, but with better sweaters) to the backs of cereal packets (it took me and my friend Nicky several years and some crack detective work finally to figure out the meaning of the word \"period\") and encountering Google was like suddenly seeing the world in Technicolor. Google is my drug and the only respite I have \u2013 even when I'm away from my desk, there's always the phone \u2013 is that information can't actually be beamed into my eyeballs every waking second of every living day. Until now. Google Glass is only currently available if you're some sort of Silicon Valley dude (see the hilarious Tumblr site White Men Wearing Google Glass for details). But as of next year, the device will be for everybody. And it scares me. Not because of what it's capable of, but because of what I am. It's not the technology that's the problem, it's me. I am the weakest link. Already there's been the steady erosion of my concentration. The way that if I don't get an instant answer, I may well just give up. And that I can't even remember my home phone number. I have to look it up on my mobile every time. It is a bit Blade Runner, this world we live in. Technology is woven into every aspect of our lives. It informs our thoughts, our memories, our relationships, every thing that makes us human and alive and who we are. And who we are is messy, and complicated, and not like the corporate PR that people churn out on their Facebook feeds. It's not all ice creams and holidays. People get ill, they die. But even then they text (well, not the dead... at least not yet). Last week's Observer carried an interview with Sherry Turkle, an American academic, who studies people and technology and has found people texting at funerals, surreptitiously under the order of service. They only do it, they tell her, during \"the boring bits\". But it's during the boring bits of life that everything happens. That your mind creatively idles. That you think. Though fiddling with your phone is probably quite a good substitute for contemplating a cold, indifferent universe that will only end in death (yours). Which brings me, finally, to Twitter. Because I am officially The Last Journalist in Britain Not on Twitter. It's not that I don't understand its utility and admire its uber-users. But writing for newspapers can already sometimes feel like a form of out-of-control narcissism, and it's not a part of my character I've actively wanted to encourage. There's a media personage I know who uses the phrase \"my followers\" out loud, though, as far as I'm aware, she's not the actual Messiah. And although I know it's theoretically about connecting with the world, whenever I look up well-known media personalities on Twitter they appear to be connecting with other well-known media personalities; tweets that sometimes form the basis of media stories written by other media folk. And most people aren't on Twitter. It's still an elitist club, a technological divide that separates those inside the echo chamber from those outside it. And I've never been sure I want to be an insider. Waitressing at the Groucho club years ago cured me of that. But it's not a sustainable stance. And after the full seven stages of grief (anger, denial, etc), I've finally reached acceptance and cracked\u2026 sorry, decided to get with the programme. And anyway, I noticed George Monbiot had a pop at me last week on it, so I might go in for a ruck. Please feel free to come and say hello (@carolecadwalla). Or, you know, don't. I once interviewed a very wise man, the writer and actor Sam Shepard, who told me he doesn't use the internet. \"But Sam!\" I said, \"everything you want to know is on Google!\" \"I can assure you,\" he replied, \"that nothing I want to know is on Google.\" He may be right. I probably don't need to add that he's not on Twitter either."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
