But the area now lays claim to a new title: the UK\u2019s witch capital. On Saturday, about 4,000 pagans and witches will descend on Croydon to delve further into the occult. While many are simply drawn to the aesthetics of being a witch, there are a growing number of radicals in the country who believe witchcraft and magic are natural extensions of their feminist and environmental activism. Witchfest, organised by Children of Artemis, a membership organisation open to witches and pagans, will include workshops on finding the new forest coven, moon magic, and wands. Organisers claim it is the largest witchcraft festival in the world. The event comes as witches emerge from broom closets across the UK to take over the popular imagination. As well as the reboot of cult TV shows such as Sabrina, the Teenage Witch (remade as the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina for Netflix) and Charmed, there are witches making podcasts and sharing tips under the hashtag #witchesofinstagram, which boasts more than 3m posts. And so many books have been written that Publishers Weekly has declared a \u201cseason of the witch\u201d. Activists have marched with placards that call on people to \u201chex the patriarchy\u201d; there is a subgroup of Extinction Rebellion for druids, witches and pagans; and self-defence classes are offered to help witches protect their minds, bodies and souls. Ayesha Tan-Jones, 26, who cofounded Shadow Sistxrs Fight Club as a self-defence class for female, non-binary, and queer witches, said there is something inherently political in describing yourself as a witch. \u201cIt\u2019s about taking control of your power and taking control of owning your destiny, and owning your magic. We live in a society that is constantly bombarding us with thoughts that we are not good enough or that we need a material thing. \u201cIn a way, we\u2019ve lost our magic and this new awakening is about us waking up to our power. And it\u2019s an urgent time to wake up.\u201d Combining Brazilian jujitsu with magical and medicinal herbalism, past classes have made herbal pepper spray, protection amulets and keyrings. Tan-Jones admits this might appear strange to the uninitiated. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know that there was someone doing counselling in the building we were having a class in and he kept coming round and staring at us. He must have been thinking \u2018what are you doing\u2019?\u2019\u201d Christina Oakley Harrington, proprietor of Treadwell\u2019s, a bookshop in London that specialises in the occult, said: \u201cPeople who get interested in witchcraft are not the most insecure and anxious people, their desire to learn magic is very much tied up with their feeling that the world is in need of a desperate change.\u201d For these activists, the identity of the witch is \u201can empowering cloak\u201d that gives them the power and strength to take a stand, Harrington added. Merlyn Hern, a spokesman for Children of Artemis, said people were drawn to Wicca and witchcraft because it is more personal than what is offered by mainstream religion. \u201cIt is more about the individual than, say, a prayer, which is very hands-off. You pray to a higher authority to make something happen, whereas a spell is totally personal and down to the individual to make sure it\u2019s right.\u201d Hern said there was also a greater diversity of people embracing witchcraft. Back in the 2000s, Witchfest was largely attended by white Europeans, but the demographic has shifted in recent years. \u201cIt\u2019s people who are more second or third or fourth generation who are breaking away,\u201d Hern said. Grace Gottardello, who describes herself as a \u201ccommunity witch,\u201d said for people of colour, witchcraft was just as much about reconnecting with their ancestral roots and building a community as it was about reclaiming power. Gottardello, who moved to the UK when she was 18, likens her childhood in northern Italy as a bit like Sabrina, the Teenage Witch. She learned about herbalism, new moon ceremonies and tarot reading from her aunts. But apart from these familial rituals, Gottardello describes growing up in her village as a black woman as largely an isolating and painful experience. The town was incredibly racist, she said, and the word witch was not ever really spoken aloud. It was only when she lived in the UK that she was able to build a community and reconnect with herself. \u201cI was recovering my identity, recovering my connection to my mum\u2019s tradition and recovering my blackness. \u201cWitchcraft is much more than tarot challenges and astrology memes. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love astrology memes, but witchcraft is also a tool for a community to protect ourselves.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
