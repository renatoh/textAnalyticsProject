So one way to take the pain away is for a corporation to outsource redundancies to someone like Ryan Bingham, the main character in this film, played by George Clooney. Bingham is a \"corporate downsizer\", a hired gun who flies around the US making people redundant. It's not something we really do in the UK, but it does happen in America, where employment law is much more in favour of the employer. Bingham is very good at what he does. He never says \"you're fired\"; instead he does his homework, reading up on the employee's background, and then giving them a motivational speech about what a good opportunity this redundancy is. I haven't used that technique on anyone myself, but it is a good lesson in the importance of preparation. When a hotshot young graduate, Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), joins Bingham's company, she sees redundancies in far less emotional terms: for her, employees are just widgets or production units. She advocates using video-conferencing to fire people, which is just horrific and inhumane. And you can't always know how someone's going to take it: one woman Keener fires later throws herself off a bridge. I haven't heard of that happening in the UK, but there was a spate of employee suicides when France Telecom was downsizing. The film is really about the old guard in human resources versus the new guard. The older generation is usually more caring in the workplace: they understand how difficult it can be for someone to be made redundant after 30 years' service. But young graduates don't always understand that. They just think: \"Fine, sack 'em, it's a cut-throat world.\" I really hope that's not the shape of things to come.
