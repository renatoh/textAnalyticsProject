Leroy Junior Medford \u2013 known to family and friends as \u201cJunior\u201d \u2013 was 43 when he died on 2 April, more than 15 hours after being arrested by Thames Valley police on suspicion of assault. An inquest heard officers were called to a house and arrested Medford on 1 April at about 1.45pm. Police were told he had \u201cpacked drugs\u201d \u2013 meaning he had put them into his anus to conceal them \u2013 and they decided he needed constant observation in case the package split or he ingested it. Giving evidence, PC Tim Forrest said officers took Medford to Loddon Valley police station, where they conducted a strip-search and concluded he might be carrying drugs between his buttocks. He was then taken to Royal Berkshire hospital, where a scan did not reveal any package in his anus. Forrest confirmed Medford had been getting \u201cgradually sleepier\u201d since being arrested. He said a nurse observed his snoring was \u201cslightly unusual\u201d, though they did not seem worried. Forrest said he could not recall any specific training he had been given on how to deal with detainees suspected of swallowing or concealing drugs before that day. Asked by Claire Palmer, representing Thames Valley police, how he would have done things differently, Forrest said: \u201cOn reflection, if I was able to go back to the incident, my actions would have been: as soon as I received that information [that he was concealing drugs], I would have not taken Junior to the police station. I would have asked for transportation to take Junior straight to hospital.\u201d Opening the inquest into Medford\u2019s death, the senior coroner for Berkshire, Heidi Connor, told the jury they would hear evidence about the actions of the police in the hours during which Medford was in their care. She said they would have to answer the question of how and in what circumstances he died. The inquest is set to last three weeks. In a statement read to the court by the coroner, Medford\u2019s older sister, Marilyn Medford-Hawkins, said her brother had been a quiet, happy child, \u201cwith an almost permanent cheeky grin on his face that followed him into adulthood\u201d. She said Medford \u2013 a father of eight and brother to seven \u2013 had been very close to his mother and had learned from her how to be a good cook. She described how his life changed after a series of family deaths. His mother died aged 54 in 1999, as did his son Carlos, aged three months. In 2009, his niece died aged 15, and in 2011, his great nephew died aged five. \u201cI noticed the deaths seemed to have a particularly bad impact on Junior and it was from around this time that we noticed he started to disappear for periods of time. I do not know if that was his way of coping or whether he stayed away from the family when he was at his worse,\u201d Medford-Hawkins said. \u201cWe had our suspicions that Junior was using drugs, but we never saw him use them or witnessed him in the state where he had just taken drugs. \u201cJunior was no angel, but he was a valued and much-loved member of our family, and we all miss him hugely, especially his presence at family events and celebrations. It is really hard to acknowledge that Junior is no longer involved in our family.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
