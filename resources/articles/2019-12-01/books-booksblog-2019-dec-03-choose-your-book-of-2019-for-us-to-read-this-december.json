And hey! It hasn\u2019t all been bad. We\u2019re still here, after all. We\u2019re still just about in the EU, even. And, in spite of the political weather, not to mention the worsening climate crisis, plenty of people have continued to do fine things, including publishing some great books. And this is a good time and place to celebrate them. So let us know \u2013 what were your favourite books in 2019? Please tell us what you\u2019ve loved reading, what\u2019s mattered to you and what\u2019s impressed you. Also, which books do you feel you missed out on reading? And what have we missed at the Guardian? Do you know of that precious gem that\u2019s just waiting to be discovered? We\u2019re open to suggestions from fiction, non-fiction and any other kind of book, so long as it was published in English in the last 12 months and it matters to you. That includes the best literature that\u2019s arrived in translation this year. As usual, we ask only that the book is widely available. It would also be splendid if you could give us a few words about why you think this is the book we should be reading. I\u2019m hoping for another fantastic list. When we did a similar survey for the first time in 2017, we ended up reading Attrib by Eley Williams. Highlighting a book that so many people had meant to read all year and tackling it together was a wonderful experience. And when we did it again in 2018, our readers recommended some truly superb books. We ended up reading The Overstory by Richard Powers \u2013 which was a divisive choice, but also made for a fascinating discussion. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what you suggest for this year. As is traditional, your suggestions and recommendations will go into the hat and I\u2019ll pull out one of them in a few days\u2019 time. That will be our book for the rest of the month \u2013 and indeed, the one that guides us through until the end of the decade. Let\u2019s make it special."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
