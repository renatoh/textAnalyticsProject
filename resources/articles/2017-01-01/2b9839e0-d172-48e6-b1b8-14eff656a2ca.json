Liverpool are four places and five points above Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s team, although recent form favours the hosts. United have won nine consecutive matches in all competitions while Chelsea\u2019s closest challengers at the Premier League summit have not won in three, the brief sequence featuring a goalless draw at home to League Two Plymouth Argyle in the FA Cup and defeat in the first leg of the EFL Cup semi-final at St Mary\u2019s Stadium in midweek. However, Klopp insists there is no reason to head to Old Trafford in trepidation. The Liverpool manager could start Philippe Coutinho for the first time since November and recall the captain, Jordan Henderson, from a heel injury. \u201cThere is nothing to fear,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cWhat could I fear? At this moment, anything is possible. It could be that United are not at their best level on Sunday, just nobody knows about it yet. \u201cI don\u2019t fear things like this. I\u2019ve had enough time in the game to realise what happens. At this moment I\u2019m 100% positive, absolutely looking forward to the game. \u201cI\u2019ve had so many defeats in my life, especially as a player \u2013 as a manager, too \u2013 that I really know defeat is not the problem. Your reaction to it is the problem. We\u2019ve now had four days to react from a really bad game on our side by playing in a very important game. I love it. That\u2019s how football should be: you can react immediately. So let\u2019s think about this and not what could happen if we can\u2019t do it.\u201d Liverpool will open a comfortable eight-point lead over their old adversaries with victory at Old Trafford but Klopp denied that would also represent a decisive step in a genuine title challenge from his team. \u201cI don\u2019t care, actually,\u201d he claimed. \u201cThe last thing I think about is if United can come back and overhaul us. It would be a huge gap, of course, but they were already a few points behind a few teams at the top of the table. \u201cThe season is too long, this game decides not a lot actually. At the moment everyone thinks Chelsea will win all their games and I don\u2019t know what they think of Tottenham. The international games come again in February and then it is difficult again. \u201cThe whole of December and January for us is outstandingly intense, which we knew already, but if these two months decide the whole season what were you doing the rest of the season? There is still a lot to be done and a lot of things to fix. So it is always better you win and all the rest draw but you cannot wish. You have to do the work.\u201d Coutinho\u2019s availability, and substitute\u2019s display at Southampton, is a timely fillip for the Liverpool manager with Sadio Man\u00e9 on Africa Cup of Nations\u2019 duty with Senegal. Klopp has not been able to select Coutinho, Man\u00e9, Roberto Firmino and Adam Lallana in the same lineup since the 6-1 rout of Watford on 6 November but, with his team only five points behind Chelsea, he insists there is no reason to rush into the transfer market this month. The Liverpool manager explained: \u201cThe right player for us, if he\u2019s available and if the club he plays for wants to sell him, that\u2019s pretty difficult at this moment because who wants to sell high-quality players? All the other players we don\u2019t need, that\u2019s how it is. You don\u2019t buy a player for one or two games, that makes no sense. \u201cWe have to go through this now. Of course it is not too cool that Sadio is not here. Of course it\u2019s not cool that Phil was injured but is now on the way back. Whether he is at exactly the same level as before the injury is another question because they are all human beings. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they can just perform like this [clicks fingers]. Of course, Daniel [Sturridge] was injured and has come in and needs some rhythm. Jo\u00ebl Matip: in best shape, then he\u2019s out. That\u2019s not cool either. \u201cBut as a squad and as a team you have to go through these situations. You have to take the benefit of being a strong group. You can imagine and believe, we always think about how we can strengthen the squad. There\u2019s absolutely no issue from the owner side. They do not think: winter \u2013 too much money. We only think about the right players. Not any player.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
