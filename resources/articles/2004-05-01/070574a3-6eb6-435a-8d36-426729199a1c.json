A campaign that began with the heartbreak of losing a Champions League qualifier will end in disappointment, without a place in Europe's top club competition for next season. A late equaliser from Darren Ambrose saved a point for Newcastle after poor defending, the woodwork and two fine saves by Southampton's Alan Blayney did much to deny them the win they needed, and so fourth place goes to Liverpool. There is no guarantee the misery for Sir Bobby Robson's team will not deepen. Newcastle may not even have the consolation of the Uefa Cup this time. They will have to win at Liverpool on Saturday - and hope Aston Villa do not manage to do so at home to Manchester United, or draw if Villa lose - to get fifth spot. Whatever happens, questions will be asked about whether Robson will see out the final year of his contract. Twice his team led but their vulnerable defence allowed Southampton to equalise, and it caved in again at the end of a second half they had dominated. The Champion League game was up when Leandre Griffit ran through to give Saints a 3-2 lead. If ever a game had been there for Newcastle to win, this was it. Their opponents not only had nothing to play for, but they were without nine members of the first-team squad. Among the absentees were three of the likely first-choice back four and the goalkeeper Antti Niemi, who was sent home with a virus. That meant a Premiership debut for Blayney and the 22-year-old goalkeeper's first touch was to pick the ball out of his net. Only seven minutes had elapsed when Shola Ameobi beat him after outwitting Claus Lundekvam. But by half-time Newcastle's vulnerability at the back, allied to enterprising Southampton attacking, meant that Robson's team had thrown away the lead twice and were level at 2-2. Only a handful of saves from Shay Given saved further damage and Southampton had looked the tidier, more dangerous side. Newcastle had early chances of their own because Southampton were also liable to creak under pressure, Kieron Dyer missing the best of them to make it 2-0 when he volleyed wide. But there was only sporadic flow to Newcastle and it was neither surprising nor unmerited when Southampton claimed a first equaliser. Paul Sturrock's team had shown signs of threat and nobody would have guessed that one of the teams had everything at stake and the other nothing. If Southampton were short on numbers, they were not low on effort or energy. They closed down quickly. Fabrice Fernandes looked capable of causing problems from the right, with his runs and crosses, while Newcastle could not cope with James Beattie in the air. Given had already saved from Anders Svensson and Yoann Folly when the home team equalised. Given's saves could not mask a mixed personal display and he looked to be at fault. Fernandes' cross had culminated in a shot by Svensson which the keeper could not hold and Beattie had only to poke the ball over the line. Not that the goalkeeper was alone in being guilty, with neither Ambrose nor Aaron Hughes managing to clear Fernandes's centre. Southampton looked little more comfortable at the back. Ameobi had found the net after outjumping Lundekvam and then holding off the defender to turn and score. The lively striker also set up Newcastle's second, getting past Lundekvam and crossing for Lee Bowyer to fire in low. Newcastle then failed to deal with another Fernandes cross, however, and Titus Bramble continued an uncertain performance by deflecting into his own net under no pressure. There was a distinct urgency to Newcastle's play early in the second half and three times in as many minutes they came close to regaining the lead. Twice the bar denied them. First Steven Caldwell's header hit woodwork from a Darren Ambrose free-kick, then Ambrose's shot found the same barrier before Blayney made an instinctive stop from Alan Shearer's downward header. A second save, from Ameobi, maintained Blayney's good work but Newcastle's dominance slipped. Soon this was end-to-end stuff, with Southampton always a danger and Given saving well from Paul Telfer. More than a few among the large contingent of Newcastle fans must have feared the Champions League was going to elude them, and so it did."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
