Jim remodels him into a standard bust-a-gut soul singer who purveys tunes so unrepentantly commercial that the album has been greeted with shock by the faithful. But it's not unappealing. Lidell sounds as though he's having fun on the bouncy Another Day and Little Bit of Feelgood, and his broiling intensity on Hurricane (to which Peaches adds backing vocals) is the vocal equivalent of a tropical storm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
