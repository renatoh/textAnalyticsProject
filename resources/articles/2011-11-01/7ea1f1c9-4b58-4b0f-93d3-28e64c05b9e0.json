Legal threats mean nothing to them. Damaging and planted headlines in the papers? They laugh them off. For the point is to flush out entrenched exploitative bankers and capitalists and to that end, they will not flinch. But one can't say the same for the hangers-on, especially those of the celebrity variety. And so the next time they get to touch the oh-so-creatively-designed hem of Vivienne Westwood's garment, they might ask her whether she shouldn't be spending a bit more time making sure that her own outfit isn't quite fairly bracketed with all of the other capitalist exploiters. Campaigners Graduate Fog wonder whether it would really kill Dame Vivienne to play the game and pay all her interns. Last month, when a \"visual merchandising assistant\" internship was advertised, the post was clearly marked \"unpaid\". Graduate Fog pursued her company but the most Dame Viv's people would say is we're a private company so we're not telling. If she returns to St Paul's, let's hope she is straight with them. \u2022 So welcome to the party, Nick Clegg: Lib Dem leader, deputy prime minister, now a warrior for race equality. Bashing the banks for discriminating against the black customers. Bemoaning the disproportionate number of young black men in prisons. Questioning the lack of black football managers in the Premier League. All welcome. But there is a long road to travel and in admitting that his party is still too \"male and pale\", he had to concede that the Lib Dems have travelled little further down it than the banks. The Lib Dems have no black MPs. Indeed they have only ever had two: Dadabhai Naoroji in 1892, and Parmjit Singh Gill, who won Leicester South 112 years later in 2004. He lost the seat in 2005. Clegg has a leadership candidate programme to increase the number of minority candidates. Still, one can understand why Bob Diamond of Barclays might balk at a lecture from him. \u2022 We all have that road to travel, and they know that at the pub chain JD Wetherspoon. That's why it has been pondering events prompted by the entry policies adopted by one of its pubs in north London. The pub sits close to the offices of the Irish Traveller Movement in Britain. And as that organisation held its annual conference, someone briefed pub security staff to ensure the ambiance was not unduly affected by an invading horde. Travellers get that a lot. And so when a thirsty party left the conference, they indeed discovered that there was no room for \"large groups\" at the inn. But now that seems a strategic mistake. For among those barred was a police inspector who acts as the head of diversity at Cheshire constabulary, a solicitor and a member of the Law Society. Legal action will follow, we are told. Might have been easier to let them have that drink. \u2022 And it's true. We really are all in this together. The cold winds of the downturn are being felt in Westminster as much as anywhere else. For one consequence of the public sector strike on 30 November is that the House of Commons banqueting service just feels it cannot guarantee the normal levels of service, thus events it might have catered for are having to be cancelled. We can all eat cake, but we'll have to fetch it for ourselves. \u2022 Finally, there was a phrase much loved by headline writers referring to famous celebrities. \"The demons that drive \u2026\" was the template; usually a cruel father, or a professional rivalry. Sometimes it was just money. In a new book, Fings Ain't Wot They Used T'Be: The Lionel Bart Story, the composer's friend Jack Grossman recalls that Bart's motivation became clear early in his career as they made their way home from visiting a prosperous actor friend who owned some Dresden china. \"On the way back Lionel said, 'Did you go to the toilet?' I said I had. 'Did you see those ornaments lined up on the shelves? They were Dresden. That's what I'm going to go for, Jack. Dresden in the toilet.' \" We all chase the Dresden in our own way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
