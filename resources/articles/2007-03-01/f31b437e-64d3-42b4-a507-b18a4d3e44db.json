Location, say estate agents: location, location, location. But what do people want around that location? According to ononemap.com, an enterprising property search site, two things that they don't want are neighbours with antisocial behaviour orders (Asbos) and a mobile phone mast in the area - singled out by 86% and 72% of those responding to a survey on the site. Those used to be difficult to ascertain: there are no maps of Asbos, and until recently working out whether there was a phone mast near a prospective purchase would involve tedious back-and-forth checking with Ofcom's Sitefinder system (sitefinder.ofcom.org.uk) on one web page against the property's details. But now ononemap's team has acquired the data for the 60,000 mast sites - including standard mobile and the emergency services' Tetra masts - and integrated them on to its own site. There is no definitive evidence that living near a phone mast has any effect on health, though some people simply find them unsightly. But it could become a bargaining point in a house negotiation. House purchase decisions are not made only on negatives, though. Philip Sheldrake, one of the site's co-founders, says: \"A friend of mine said that what matters to parents is 'location of schools, location of schools, location of schools'. So we added the locations of secondary schools in England, taken from the Department for Education and Science's site.\" Ononemap also increasingly shows the locations of supermarkets. For the future, Sheldrake hopes to add the locations of primary schools, preschools, cash machines and post offices. Ononemap launched in 2005 after Google created its Google Maps application, with a system that lets users create mashups locating objects of interest on the map at various scales. \"The attraction of using Google Maps rather than the Ordnance Survey's online maps is that Google Maps is free,\" Sheldrake says. Instead, the cost of running the site - which is free to use - is covered by payments from Google adverts appearing on it. But the provision of such data - particularly on phone masts - outside government sites creates the condition for a test of Guardian Technology's Free Our Data campaign, which calls for impersonal data collected by government agencies to be made available without charge. Will making data about phone masts available to everyone encourage economic activity? Ononemap is not a commercial site; instead, it acts as a portal to estate agents' own sites. There are already 700 companies uploading house details. So how could Sheldrake prove the commercial value of free data, and make the site into a moneyspinner? \"We have said that we won't charge to show property on the site,\" he says. \"But Google has sponsored links - maybe we'll have sponsored houses advertised on it.\" \u00b7 Join the debate at the Free Our Data blog \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
