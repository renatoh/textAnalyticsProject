While Australia have booked a semi-final berth by moving to 12 points with a sixth win, England must beat India and New Zealand in their final group games to ensure the chasing pack of Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan are truly kept at bay. This high-pressure scenario for the world\u2019s No 1 side comes after an initially fruitless morning with the ball allowed Australia to post 285 for seven \u2013 Aaron Finch top-scored with 100 \u2013 before limping to 221 all out from 44.4 overs in the chase. \u201cConfidence isn\u2019t where it was at the start of the tournament,\u201d said Morgan, whose side have now lost three games in the World Cup while chasing \u2013 previously their strong suit in ODI cricket. \u201cI think both this game and the defeat to Sri Lanka, we struggled with the basics of our batting mantra: strong intent, building partnerships and doing it in our own way. Everything is within our control. We are in charge of how we go from here on in. We win two games, we definitely go through.\u201d Morgan was himself caught on the hook for four off Mitchell Starc during a top-order collapse of 54 for four, with Kevin Pietersen suggesting the England captain had backed away when facing the left-armer\u2019s first delivery. The former England batsman wrote on Twitter: \u201cOh no, Eoin Morgan looked scared! That Is A Horror Sign.\u201d He then added: \u201cThe England captain stepping to square leg when Starc bowled his first delivery to him made me think England could have a little problem over the next week or so. I hope not, but I\u2019ve not seen a captain show such a weakness for a while.\u201d When this assessment was put to Morgan, the England captain replied: \u201cReally? Excellent. It didn\u2019t feel like that at all.\u201d After Morgan\u2019s dismissal, Ben Stokes fought hard, defying tightness in both calf muscles to top score with 89. But when a memorable inswinging Starc yorker crashed into his stumps to leave England 177 for six, the game was in effect up. Jason Behrendorff, who kickstarted the English rot by bowling James Vince for a duck second ball, finished with the standout figures of five for 44 and a place on the Lord\u2019s honours boards. Speaking afterwards, Behrendorff revealed that watching England\u2019s bowlers fail to make inroads with the new ball \u2013 Finch and David Warner put on 123 for the first wicket \u2013 informed Australia\u2019s lengths when it came to defending the total. The left-armer said: \u201cThat\u2019s something we were assessing when they were bowling \u2013 not many balls were hitting the stumps and we made a conscious effort to get the ball up there and try and swing it.\u201d As with Pietersen\u2019s assertion, Morgan was having none of it, replying: \u201cWe made Australia play and miss a lot. But that\u2019s his opinion and he\u2019s entitled to it.\u201d The form of Stokes, who also top-scored in the defeat to Sri Lanka, was England\u2019s chief positive with the bat. And in typically bullish fashion the all-rounder outlined this England team\u2019s sense of destiny, despite now entering must-win territory. Stokes said: \u201cThis is our World Cup. We\u2019ve had great support over the last four years and we know how much a World Cup means to fans. We know that as players as well. We\u2019re not going to take a backward step. This is our World Cup.\u201d Jason Roy, who has missed England\u2019s last three games with a torn hamstring, netted on the Nursery Ground between innings; the chances of his return to face India on Sunday have surely increased despite the obvious risk of a recurrence. Morgan added: \u201cWith four days of rehabilitation he is hopeful of being fit. If it is a big risk, we will play it as it is.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
