In an interview broadcast on Monday, Bolsonaro said he hoped Congress would approve his controversial plans to expand the so-called excludente de ilicitude \u2013 an article in Brazil\u2019s criminal code that makes some normally illegal acts permissible. Activists fear that could cause a bloodbath, but Bolsonaro claimed it would provide much-needed \u201clegal cover\u201d to police officers who used lethal force in the line of duty and bring a \u201cdramatic\u201d drop in violence. \u201cThese guys [criminals] are going to die in the streets like cockroaches [if such protections are approved] \u2013 and that\u2019s how it should be,\u201d he said. Bolsonaro argued Brazilian police were fighting an \u201cunequal\u201d battle against crime and should be decorated for using their guns, not taken to court. \u201cUpstanding citizens\u201d also deserved protection if they needed to use lethal force to protect their lives or properties. The remarks, inflammatory even by Bolsonarian standards, were applauded by supporters but sparked outrage among campaigners and the opposition. \u201cThese are abhorrent comments,\u201d said Ariel de Castro Alves, a veteran human rights activist and lawyer in S\u00e3o Paulo. Alves claimed Bolsonaro\u2019s truculent and dehumanising discourse had already caused a spike in deadly police violence \u2013 largely against poor, young, black men \u2013 and feared the planned legislation would make things even worse. \u201cWe\u2019ve had 414 killings committed by military police in S\u00e3o Paulo [in the first half of 2019] \u2013 that is the highest number since 2003 \u2026 He is encouraging police violence and ends up serving as a kind of instigator of brutality,\u201d Alves said. Robert Muggah, the head of a Brazilian thinktank the Igarap\u00e9 Institute, said there had been a similar spike in slayings in Rio de Janeiro where police gunned down 434 people in the first three months of 2019. \u201cThis is the highest number recorded in over two decades,\u201d Muggah said. In the first six months of this year Rio police reportedly killed 881 people \u2013 or one person every five hours. \u201cOur concern is that this kind of rhetoric can encourage police to deploy more excessive force and could result, in fact, in more police violence than is currently the case,\u201d Muggah added. \u201cThis is clearly a concern in a country that already registers the highest absolute amount of lethal violence and some of the highest levels of police killings in the world.\u201d Last year Brazilian police killed nearly 6,200 people compared to 5,225 in 2017, official figures show."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
