Lots of it. \"What the government was doing with the Children Act and with Every Child Matters, and what I was now doing as the person putting these policies into effect in Dudley, was changing the whole way children were viewed and catered for, not just by local authorities, but by a lot of other bodies too,\" he says. \"It's a huge cultural shift. It's about the way we view children and young people; how we listen to them; how we reflect back what we've heard, and how we see their place in our society.\" As an education chief, Freeman had spent a lot of his time musing on how to improve individual schools and on how to ratchet up results across the borough. Suddenly, as director of children's services, his remit was wide open: every aspect of life for 50,000 children across a busy borough had become his responsibility. \"Compared with the relatively simple demands of being a director of education, this new role is immensely complex,\" he says. \"And it weighs extremely heavily: it's one thing to know, intellectually, that you have a role as corporate parent to children in care, quite another to find yourself being asked to sign a form taking a child's liberty away because they've engaged in antisocial behaviour. Equally, you're constantly asking yourself how things could be done better, and, if there's a tragedy, could they have been done better. Last week a child in Dudley was raped, and I have to ask myself: 'Is there anything we could have done to have prevented that?' \" Dudley has around 450 looked-after children, and Freeman is unapologetic that around half his time is spent on their needs. \"There are very important policy changes going through with the green paper on children in care, which partly accounts for why it's taking up so much time,\" he says. \"But equally, I have to signal by my actions what I think important. In the past, for example, if a child in care was excluded from school, the child's social worker would be informed and would be in touch with the school. Today, in Dudley, if a looked-after child is excluded from school, I personally will talk to the headteacher the same day; because it really is that important, and I really do have to be involved at that level in order to do everything we can to give that child the best possible chance of succeeding in the long term.\" Integrating social workers and teachers is another item high on Freeman's agenda. \"In the past you'd get teachers saying 'if only social workers could get it right', and vice versa. But the new thinking is that we're all in the same business: 'they' have become 'us'. That's a huge shift in thinking, but I think we are getting there.\" Freeman admits he does come across headteachers who are resistant to the changes that new policies are bringing. \"But the resistance is almost always practical, not philosophical. They understand the need for these changes, even where there are difficulties in finding the resources.\" The ex-social worker Liz Railton is director of children's services in Essex Liz Railton was appointed in 2003, ahead of the legislation reorganising children's services; and, given that the post was entirely new, not yet backed by statute, and that it made her responsible for almost 600 schools despite the fact that she had a social work background, hers was - not surprisingly - a rather controversial appointment. \"There was great suspicion - a palpable lack of confidence in me, from schools in particular,\" she remembers. \"Teachers didn't know whether I could talk turkey to heads about education issues, others felt I'd be solely motivated by a concern for the most vulnerable children, and that I'd be unable to lead a universal system that was about all children. Yes, it was a scary thing to take up this post ...\" Even the language of education, she admits, was sometimes beyond her. Three years on, she likes to think hardly anyone remembers she had no education hinterland. \"So much has changed; the legislation has come in, and, most importantly, there's been a real acceptance of the agenda. Everyone knew, in their hearts, it made no sense for education to sit in one box and social care issues in another. It's much better for all this to be combined. \"It's been interesting because I think it has been slower for the people in central government. They're removed from the situation on the ground, for one thing. For a couple of years they did seem to be struggling to get the narrative straight. But now, I think, they have and they're moving forward more quickly.\" Railton admits there is still scepticism among some headteachers. \"What they fear is they're being drawn into an agenda that's a distraction from their main job - that they've got enough to do without, for example, moving on extended schools. But that's a minority point of view. What I find, on the whole, is enthusiasm to take on the challenge of how to reach children who have lots of problems in their lives, and who come to school in no fit state to learn. We all want to do something.\" Railton's authority is more heavily populated than Freeman's: Essex has around 322,000 children, of whom around 1,200 are in care. And, while these looked-after children's interests lie close to her heart, as his do to Freeman's, Railton admits her background makes her perhaps more used to the responsibility that goes with being a corporate parent. \"I don't want to give the impression that I take it for granted,\" she says. \"John is right to say it's a fundamental part of our role, and it's something I'm used to because of my past: as a social worker for 10 years I had lots of looked-after children on my caseload.\" In a way, she says, her social work background helps her deal with the difficulties her job throws at her. \"When you hear a school has been put in special measures by Ofsted, you know it's important,\" she says. \"But you're also aware that this is nothing like how it feels to hear one of your looked-after children has been in some terrible tragedy. For me, that thought puts everything into perspective.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
