England take on South Africa in Durban and the FA is working closely with the British Council and Kick it Out, Britain's leading football anti-racism group, on sending the fans to emphasise its commitment to anti-racist initiatives. Soho Square officials are deeply embarrassed by the racism charges and believe that next month's match will be an ideal opportunity to start changing the racist image of some England fans. The black and Asian group will address South African supporters and hold a number of workshops on combating racism within the game. Nelson Mandela is likely to attend next month's match, which will also mark the launch of South Africa's campaign to host the 2010 World Cup."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
