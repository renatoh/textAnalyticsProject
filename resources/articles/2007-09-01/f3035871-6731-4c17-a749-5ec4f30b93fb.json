In 1981, with a team centred on Nicolai Ceaucescu's ever-so-popular army and police, they nearly beat the All Blacks. Qualified ahead of Georgia and Spain and beat Namibia in June. How they see it Record 134-0 defeat, by England in 2001, could come under threat against New Zealand, but they'll fancy their chances against Portugal, a team they pipped 92-0 in 1996. Also won their most recent meeting with Italy, in 2004. The coach Daniel Santamans' reign began inauspiciously but the French pack specialist has instilled much-needed discipline since then, working on a shoestring. The captain Sorin Socol has led the side since 2003. The 29-year-old Pau lock, one of a number of highly rated and French-based forwards, has relatively fast feet for a very big man indeed. The linchpin Romeo Gontineac attends his fourth World Cup. The centre, who plays for Aurillac in France, has scored 17 tries for his country. How they'll play With extremely big forwards and not much else. Following one tradition that the collapse of the country's Communist dictatorship did not sweep away, this side has an average pack weight of around 18 stone, thanks to the likes of monster prop Petru Balan. That's up there with the biggest teams. Key fact Florica Murariu, the team's captain in the heady days of the 1980s, was shot dead at a roadblock during the 1989 revolution. Omen A double celebration is in store for Razvan Mavrodin on September 29 - his 34th birthday and victory over the All Blacks.
