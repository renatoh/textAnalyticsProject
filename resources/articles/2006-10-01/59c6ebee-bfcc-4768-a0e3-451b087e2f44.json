I didn't like it much - it seemed to me to be a filmed play, probably because it is, and I'm not sure what you'd get from it that you wouldn't get from seeing it on stage. Theatrical acting close-up, perhaps (like stage makeup in bright sunshine - not good). And a real motorbike. The ideas in the film about the past are interesting, though - that it's crucial to our understanding of the present. And that learning about it needn't be a bore. I'm getting a lot of that from Suez: A Very British Crisis (BBC2), too. All the ingredients are there in this brilliant three-part documentary - plus a few extra ones (if it was a fruitcake recipe by, say, Mrs Beeton, then we're talking a fruitcake with icing). So as well as all the facts, and all the old footage, and the blotchy old boys trying to unfuddle the past, there's the odd treat. Such as Omar Sharif remembering that King Farouk used to cheat at poker. He would actually count himself as a card - so when he had three kings, he'd say he had four, and no one dared ask him to show. No wonder they had a revolution and sent him packing (though in the nicest possible way - in the royal yacht with all of his money, most of which was probably won by cheating at poker). It wasn't so good for the novelist Marina Warner's dad, whose beloved bookshop was burned to the ground. And even worse for the other Brits being butchered down at the Turf Club, just for being British. I think Hector, one of the teachers from Alan Bennett's play, would approve, not of the butchered Brits, but of the way we're being taught about them - with wit and analysis, as well as facts and dates. There are probably parallels between Churchill and Eden (played by James Fox) and Blair and Brown, too, but I'm buggered if I know what they are. Fascinating all the same. In a dark corner of my mum's kitchen a strange and sorry creature lurks. She's very old - so old that no one remembers when she arrived, or who let her in. She's just always been there. Her spine is broken in so many places that she can't sit up properly, but instead lies in a heap, crumpled and dishevelled. And, like so many old ladies, she's covered in food - dried Yorkshire pudding batter, fruitcake mixture, icing too, probably. Her name is Mrs Beeton. The Secret Life of Mrs Beeton (BBC4) did something extraordinary - it not only breathed life into the old bird, but rejuvenated her. And what a life it was - not what you'd expect at all. She wasn't matronly and apronly, but young and saucy, entrepreneurial, too. If she'd been born 150 years later, she'd probably be a dotcom billionaire (there's that history thing again, see). But along with all the recipes and household management tips, there was so much sadness, too - children dying again and again (not the same one but a whole string of them, all hers), bankruptcy, syphilis, and her own death at 28. No wonder she looks so clapped out now, in my mum's kitchen. Ah, another new channel from Five, the second in two days, by my calculations. Stephen King's Nightmares and Dreamscapes (Five US) are fun, in a macabre sort of way. Sixty-minute dramatisations of short stories by the head honcho of horror; this opener, called Battleground, told the story of a man (played by William Hurt) who assassinates the owner of a toyshop. He later receives a package in the post - a set of toy soldiers hellbent on revenge. Hurt gets hurt, hurt bad. The toy soldiers launch rockets and mortars at him, and fly helicopters around his apartment, which soon starts to look like an abattoir. Hurt goes from satisfied, icy assassin to a wreck of a man, crawling around in his own entrails. And all without a single line of dialogue. Perhaps an hour was too long, but it certainly left me feeling quite bashed about too. And my advice to you, if you get a parcel from Hamleys through the post, is to return it straight to sender without opening it, particularly if you've recently murdered the boss. Conviction (Five US) seems to be This Life taken into the 21st century and across the Atlantic. Ludicrously attractive, young New York lawyers, alphas of both sexes, go at each other like pit bull terriers by day. And like rabbits by night. Quite promising, I think."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
