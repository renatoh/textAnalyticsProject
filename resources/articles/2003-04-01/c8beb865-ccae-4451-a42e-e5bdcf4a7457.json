Any fashionista worth her sea salt will be carrying a board - preferably with a designer logo on it: Chanel, Gucci, Prada and French Connection have come up with designs on boards this season. What's more, board babes can pick up a few pointers from Blue Crush - the bikini-clad surf-chick flick that has just come out. While surfing in the UK may not be as glamorous as the sun-drenched scenes from Blue Crush - anything less than a wetsuit isn't an option here - the current fashion scene reflects an emerging trend. For the first time, more women than men are taking up surfing; 60 per cent of new boarders are female. 'There are a lot more girls giving it a go, and new surfers are also getting older - we're seeing more people in their thirties and even forties taking up surfing,' says Glenn Harris of Surfed Out, Europe's largest surf school. And if the number of enquiries and pre-bookings are anything to go by, this summer looks set to be their busiest yet. The surfing bug is easy to catch. Katy, a typically blonde, toned and tanned 'surf chick' - looking like a model from French Connection's Fcukiki Beach spring collection - tells me: 'When my new boyfriend offered to take me away for the weekend I didn't expect to be camping on the beach, squeezed into an unflattering rubber suit and then dropped in the freezing sea!' But six months on she's caught the bug and drives down from London most weekends to catch the waves. 'I love, love, love it - you get such a buzz from surfing, a real high.' And surfing in style has just become easier: last weekend the Little Beach Hotel, which claims to be Britain's first surf hotel, opened in Woolacombe, Devon, and there are more on the way - another in Woolacombe by the end of the year and one in Newquay, possibly by next summer. Run by Surfed Out, the Little Beach Hotel promises to take the hassle out of surfing with little luxuries like a drying room for damp wetsuits. I arrive to the sound of the Red Hot Chilli Peppers' By the Way (it's compulsory to like this band if you want to get into surfing) to find a bright and breezy, budget boutique number - lots of bleached wooden floors, natural-toned walls and fantastic views over the beach. 'It's a one-stop surfing paradise,' says the hotel's Alex Liddle, referring to the packages which include half-board accommodation, board and wetsuit hire, tuition and sports massages to help ease the muscle ache (and they will ache) after a day riding the waves. There are added extras, such as board storage, a board repair workshop and flexible meal times for surf junkies who want to be out in the waves at dawn. And you can check the surf from your bedroom window. 'Our aim is to welcome anyone with a passion for the beach and the waves who is looking for a holiday with a difference_ and a good nightlife,' says Liddle. Luckily, everyone I meet confirms that surfing is the best hangover cure you'll find. Until now British surfers had little choice when it came to accommodation; rough and ready dormitory-style surf lodges, chintzy B&amp;Bs or a campervan. Housed in a converted beachfront B&amp;B, Little Beach Hotel is aimed at the untapped market of older, wealthier and more discerning surfers who don't fancy roughing it - girls, for instance, will appreciate hair-dryers and large mirrors in the bathrooms. The meals - by Bert the Belgian chef - help you stay healthy without feeling hungry, and the laidback atmosphere is conducive to the surfing lifestyle. Before hitting the water I get the lowdown from a few buff (that's 'very fit') surfers at the local surf shack and bar, The Red Barn. As more Chilli Peppers blasts through the speakers, Chris Griffiths, professional surfer and European longboarding champion, tells me: 'Surfing is as close as I get to religion. Everything in my life comes second to surfing - if the surf's good and I have a friend's wedding or a job to go to, I'll always choose surfing.' So what do the guys make of girls surfing? One bronzed boarder tells me: 'I think it's great that more girls are giving it a go. Perhaps it's the fashion side that's made it more accessible, and while I hate trendy surfers - the ones who turn up with all the gear and try it just to be cool - if that brings more women into the sport long-term, then that's cool.' No need to ask any of these honey-skinned, dishevelled blond blokes whether they'll be riding a Chanel surfboard this summer... no self-respecting surfer would be seen dead on one. In springtime the water is icy, and my surfing sisters do nothing to comfort me: 'When a five-foot wave drops on you it feels like knives driving into your head,' says one. 'Piss in your wetsuit,' suggests fellow surfer Lucy. 'When the water's freezing and you've just wiped out under a huge wave, you'll understand.' And you thought surfing was the last word in cool this season? Once I've squeezed and squirmed and pulled my way into a wetsuit - which feels like the best pair of support tights ever, but all over my body - I head nervously towards the white water... and guess what? It really isn't that cold. Kieran and Justin, our excellent instructors, are on hand to shout 'paddle!' at all the right moments and are full of confidence-boosting comments when things get tough. After being beaten by waves, slapped by surf and having swallowed far more than my recommended daily allowance of salt, I finally wobble to my feet for all of five glorious seconds... but it feels like much, much longer. So this is what it's all about... I begin to understand the hype. At the end of an exhilarating and at times annihilating day, I crawl back to the hotel feeling the gain was worth the total-body pain. That night I proudly party to the Red Hot Chilli Peppers soundtrack, wondering whether tomorrow will wash in another day of clean rideable waves or a flat, mirror-like sea.
