Although Garde, a former Lyon manager and Arsenal defensive midfielder, is believed to be keen on filling Newcastle\u2019s vacancy for a head coach, other candidates have not been discounted. Garde hopes to visit Tyneside to inspect Newcastle\u2019s training facilities in the coming days but discussions are also planned with at least one rival. Newcastle\u2019s caution in ensuring they make the right appointment means John Carver is likely to still be in caretaker charge when Southampton visit St James\u2019 Park on Saturday. With shortlisted names such as St Etienne\u2019s Christophe Galtier, the former Mainz coach Thomas Tuchel and Derby County\u2019s Steve McClaren potentially being available in the summer \u2013 although in McClaren\u2019s case that is a remote possibility \u2013 the option of Carver continuing until May remains on the table. Carver, though, is still to preside over a win and may need a victory against Southampton to convince Mike Ashley, Newcastle\u2019s owner, he is a sufficiently safe pair of hands to prevent the team being drawn into a relegation fight. Garde possesses persuasive advocates in Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and G\u00e9rard Houllier but he has limited experience as a No1 and resigned from Lyon last May for a combination of family reasons and exhaustion. Accordingly Lee Charnley and Graham Carr \u2013 Newcastle\u2019s managing director and chief scout and the men spearheading the search on Ashley\u2019s behalf \u2013 the club are believed to be assessing the 48-year-old\u2019s case and he is expected to be invited for further talks before any final decision is reached. A potential sticking point is Garde\u2019s apparent desire to bring his old coaching staff from Lyon, some of whom are still under contract at the French club. Frank de Boer, the Ajax manager and another name thought to feature on the Newcastle shortlist, has already said that he is not interested in succeeding Pardew. Unfortunately for Newcastle fans, Moussa Sissoko has made it plain he is extremely interested in joining Arsenal, moreover. On Friday the team\u2019s best midfielder learned that Paris Saint-Germain would not, after all, be trying to sign him this month when Laurent Blanc, the coach, said he does \u201cnot fit our profile\u201d. Undeterred, Sissoko has told the French television programme T\u00e9l\u00e9foot: \u201cArsenal have always been the club of my heart \u2026 I hope to sign for a big club one day.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
