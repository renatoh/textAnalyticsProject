Kardashian West, 38, drew accusations of cultural appropriation after she detailed plans for the brand last week. Critics said the name \u201ckimono\u201d disrespected Japanese culture and disregarded the significance behind the traditional outfit. On Monday Kardashian West announced on Twitter she was changing the name. She she would \u201cbe in touch soon\u201d with a new brand name \u2013 but did not say what that would be. She wrote: \u201cMy brands and products are built with inclusivity and diversity at their core and after careful thought and consideration, I will be launching my Solutionwear brand under a new name. I will be in touch soon.\u201d Yuka Ohishi, a San Francisco-based videographer who helped spread the hashtag #KimOhNo, decrying the brand\u2019s name, told the Guardian she had not expected Kardashian West to cave in to the pressure. Ohishi said: \u201cGiven her and her family\u2019s past of appropriating cultures, I had little hope that she would reconsider the brand name. I am annoyed that there was no apology, but I think this is still one of the best outcomes possible from the horrible situation. [Kardashian West] says she has respect for the Japanese culture, but this was just simply not the right way to express that and make \u2018a nod\u2019 to it.\u201d Ohishi said she hoped celebrities and brands would think twice and \u201cdo their research to understand what cultural significance items or concepts have\u201d. She said: \u201cDiversity and representation is very different from cultural appropriation, and it\u2019s going to be an ongoing conversation for all of us.\u201d Daisaku Kadokawa, the mayor of Kyoto, wrote a letter to Kardashian West last week, asking her to reconsider the trademark on Kimono. His staff is working to register \u201cKimono culture\u201d on Unesco intangible cultural heritage list, he said. He wrote: \u201cKimono is a traditional ethnic dress fostered in our rich nature and history with our predecessors\u2019 tireless endeavours and studies, and it is a culture that has been cherished and passed down with care in our living. We think that the names for \u2018kimono\u2019 are the asset shared with all humanity who love kimono and its culture therefore they should not be monopolized.\u201d Kardashian West\u2019s new line is a collection of skin-tone colored shapewear akin to Spanx that she claimed to have been working on for a year. Kardashian West provided no explanation for the use of the word \u201ckimono\u201d, but it appeared to be a play on her first name."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
