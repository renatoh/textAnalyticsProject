The NSW treasurer, Dominic Perrottet, called the financial relations between the commonwealth and the states \u201ca mess\u201d in his budget speech, while announcing an expert panel to review the arrangements. That comes on top of the establishment of the Board of Treasurers group by the states and territories in 2017, largely out of frustrations with how the commonwealth was negotiating and administrating funding arrangements. Perrottet said the NSW review would examine funding arrangements from the state perspective. \u201cWe need to refresh the national conversation on how we can leverage our federation to deliver sustainable funding arrangements for our state,\u201d he said. The Victorian treasurer, Tim Pallas, said the Andrews government would be \u201cwatching the NSW review carefully\u201d and he would speak to Perrottet about it. \u201cWe have an unprecedented pipeline of infrastructure projects and service upgrades we just want to get on with delivering it,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cTo do that, we need the commonwealth to be working with us.\u201d Victoria has previously expressed frustration with the federal government\u2019s control over funding negotiations, and was a key player in establishing the board of treasurers, which sits without the federal treasurer, in order for the states to present a stronger negotiating position. Queensland\u2019s treasurer, Jackie Trad, who oversees Australia\u2019s third-largest economy after NSW and Victoria, said she too would like to see further details on the NSW review. \u201cWhether it\u2019s fighting for a fair deal on the GST, infrastructure funding, the NDIS, remote Indigenous housing, or on early childhood education, the Palaszczuk government is on the record that the current system isn\u2019t working for Queenslanders,\u201d she said. The Western Australian treasurer, Ben Wyatt, agreed there was more work to be done to simplify and streamline the state-federal funding arrangements, which sit as a foundation of the federation agreement. \u201cI am interested in the proposals raised by my NSW counterpart and look forward to discussing them further at the next board of treasurers meeting,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, I would note, that the success or failure of these proposals will be determined by the level of engagement of the federal government.\u201d A spokesman for the federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, referred to the last negotiations on the GST distribution, which were legislated in the last parliament, setting out a minimum funding floor no state or territory would fall below. \u201cThe Coalition government fixed the GST so it is fairer and more sustainable so that no state or territory is worse off,\u201d he said. \u201cNSW as a sovereign state is entitled to conduct its own reviews to inform its view that it brings to commonwealth state treasurer\u2019s meetings.\u201d But while the GST negotiations, which ended with NSW, Victoria and Queensland successfully winning a concession no state would be worse off, were settled, the future of scores of funding arrangements continue to be a source of frustration. The complex web of national partnership agreements, which lay out future spending in health, education, and social programs, limit how far into the future states and territories can plan, and are based on estimate of population growth and demand. The former prime minister Tony Abbott ordered a review into federation reform in 2014, noting the right to be \u201csovereign in their own sphere\u201d, but the reforms were abandoned under Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s tenure as prime minister in 2017. Turnbull had briefly flirted with the idea of handing back a portion of income tax to the state\u2019s to spend as they wished, but landed instead on a Productivity Commission review into GST allocation, which eventually led to the legislation which was passed in late 2018. The nation\u2019s treasurers, with the exception of Frydenberg, will meet again in August, where the future of financial regulations will be on the agenda, ahead of the next Coag meeting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
