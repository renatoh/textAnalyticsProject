Wally, now 83, does a very good line in self-promotion. You could hear the more modest Carrington doing his best to rein Bygraves in. \"I've done 19 [royal command performances] actually,\" boasted Bygraves. \"There's nobody to even come near it. I've done more command performances than the Queen!\" Carrington tactfully and speedily changed the subject. There were some warm moments between the two vintage entertainers. Asked why he had moved to Australia, Bygraves replied, \"I like the people - they make me sound educated,\" and this clearly tickled Carrington. But mostly Carrington acted as if he was dealing with a boisterous puppy. \"I've got my own hair, my own teeth,\" said Bygraves. \"You've got your own personality, Max,\" added Carrington. There was the unmissable whiff of the backhanded compliment about that last observation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
