So it's no surprise that when I went to spend a gap year teaching English there in 1974, I stayed for four. What is more astonishing is that 30 years have gone by since. Flares and ponchos have been and gone - and, somewhat depressingly, come back again. Back then, Franco was still in power and people warned me not to talk about politics in bars because of the secret police. Not that I had much intention of doing anything as serious as that. Being young, the last time I was in Seville I eschewed culture in favour of bars and discos (as they were called then, children). So I decided it was about time I returned to be a proper grown-up tourist. Winter is a great time to visit Seville as the temperature is perfect for walking - a very rewarding occupation in this architecturally interesting city with its atmospheric back streets. It's warm enough to sit outside in the middle of the day and feel the sun on your face while you have a coffee or a beer and watch the passers-by, with the palm trees arcing attractively against the blue sky. In summer, the daytime temperatures can reach well into the 40s, which makes life miserable for commuting locals and uncomfortable for sightseeing. In the winter the crowds are much smaller than at Easter and during the May horse fair. This makes wandering around an area such as the Barrio Santa Cruz, with its narrow, enchanting alleyways and lovely plazas, a joy. I was met at the airport by a teaching companion from the old days, Ursula, who is still giving classes at 68. She took me straight off for a cold beer and we agreed that neither of us looked the least bit different. I retraced my old daily route to work up the pedestrianised and bustling Calle Sierpes with its caf\u00e9s, bars, bakeries and shops, past the cathedral to the Calle Santander where the Academia Assimil, where I spent those years, used to be. It closed down some time ago, but I was more saddened to see the bar/restaurant Bodeg\u00f3n Torre del Oro, almost exactly opposite, had also recently shut down. We probably spent more hours there than we did teaching. In the absence of the Bodeg\u00f3n, Ursula and I had lunch at the Casa de la Moneda at the opposite end of the street from the Guadalquivir. Roasted peppers, grilled baby squid, fried anchovies and chickpeas with ham set us up for the walk over the bridge and down to the old quarter of Triana with its potteries. I would have cut my hand off rather than buy souvenirs in the old days - but no such snobbish qualms now. Not to be missed on a short trip to Seville is the magnificent cathedral, the largest in the world and built in the 15th century on the site of a mosque. The minaret was retained as the bell tower and the views are terrific from the top - once you've trudged up the 35 ramps, put there instead of stairs so that horsemen could ride up. Though what they would do once up there remains unclear to me. I had managed to drag myself here for a swift look around in the Seventies, but I had never made it to the Alc\u00e1zar across the square. More fool me. This Moorish palace is breathtaking in the beauty of its interiors and their exquisitely and intricately carved stone fretwork and endless arches. Its gardens are lovely with their fountains, pools, orange trees and blossoms. Before leaving the city I went to the chapel of the Virgin of the Macarena, perhaps the most popular of Seville's madonnas (though everyone has their favourite). She attracts huge, adoring crowds when she is paraded through the streets in Holy Week and I had only ever been able to catch glimpses of her in the crush as people surged to call out compliments and devotions to her. (Not everyone was completely spiritual in their surging. A Spanish friend's mother told me before my first Holy Week excursion: 'Take a hat pin, dear.' 'Why?' 'You'll find out.' And I did.) La Macarena turned out to be extraordinary at closer quarters, splendidly arrayed, topped with an enormous gold halo, and crystal tears sliding down her beautiful face, perpetually in mourning as locals pop in to pay their daily respects. I took the short train journey to Jerez de la Frontera, where I met another old friend, Mercedes, who was my pupil when she was 10 and I was 18. Thirty years on, Jerezanos still indulge their curious penchant for dressing in tweed, brogues and corduroy, which must be something to do with the English legacy in the sherry business. Anyone who goes to Jerez must visit the Royal Andalucian School of Equestrian Art. Either book to see a show or, as I did, go to a training session which also includes a tour of the stables. The horses are glorious (so are most of the riders) and the balletic routines stunning. It only remained to take a nostalgic drive down to Chipiona and Sanlucar de Barrameda, where I spent many summer weekends and which have grown, but remained unspoilt. I sat and marvelled that so many busy years had slipped by without my returning to this wonderful place. Well, I won't let that happen again.
