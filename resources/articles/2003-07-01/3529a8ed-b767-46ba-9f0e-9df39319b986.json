But beneath the surface of the 6-2, 6-2 scoreline lay material that the defending champion's future opponents might care to study, along with the videotape from Williams' defeat at the hands of Justine Henin-Hardenne in Paris last month, as an indication of how to turn her attributes against her. In the days when Britain's top women played the world's best on a regular basis, Ann Jones often came up against Billie Jean King, who had a formula for dealing with Jones's assets. When you're playing a large-chested woman, the American champion said, make her hit a lot of high backhand volleys. So few points are played at the net these days that, taken literally, King's advice would be worthless. But the principle still holds, and Dementieva tried a variation against Williams in their fourth-round match. They were meeting for the first time, and the Russian knew that there was no point in going on to the court without a game plan. What she tried to do was turn Williams' strength into a liability. According to Martina Navratilova, the younger Williams sister has the best legs in tennis. The best, that is, for playing tennis. Like a heavyweight boxer's legs, they are the source of her phenomenal power, providing a platform for those pummelling baseline drives with which the heavily built Williams tends to pulverise her opponents. But they are not a sprinter's legs, and that was what Demen tieva tried to exploit. In a match between two 21-year-olds, the gulf between the No1 and No15 seeds was so vast that Dementieva hurried from the court at the end without observing the etiquette of waiting for her conqueror. Yet though she could find no comfort in the experience, Jennifer Capriati, who will face Williams in today's quarter-final, might profit from the Russian's efforts. The champion was 4-0 up inside 10 minutes, and it looked as though the Centre Court might be in for the sort of one-sided embarrassment that the women's singles usually reserves for the final. When the Russian's serve was broken for the second time, the words \"Game to Miss Williams\" were out of the umpire's mouth almost before the winning forehand return had touched the grass. In the fifth game Dementieva finally held her serve, unveiling her impressive forehand for the first time in the match. She finished the game off with a subtle change of pace on her second serve, from slow to very slow, prompting a miscalculation from Williams. Encouraged, she used her forehand to take Williams' serve in the next game, moving her opponent from wing to wing with shots so firmly guided and precisely weighted to the corners that she was able to close the game with Serena totally wrong-footed, doing the splits on the baseline while trying to shift her weight against her direction of travel. Williams took her revenge in the next two games, hammering away at Dementieva's weak second serve and then profiting from the Russian's unreliable backhand to take the first set in 23 minutes. But in holding her serve in the first game of the second set, after fighting off four break points, Dementieva showed that her strategy had not been without merit. Again she forced Williams to race from one end of the baseline to another, cleverly break ing the rhythm and fending off one of the break points by driving the ball twice in succession where, by this time, her opponent least expected it: plumb down the middle. Although Dementieva's plan was too limited to give her a chance of winning the match against a vastly more resourceful player, she enjoyed enough success to provide encouragement for others. But four backhand errors against Williams' serve in the final game demonstrated that it is not enough to expose your opponent's principal weakness without finding a way of camouflaging your own. Now Williams goes on to meet Capriati, the last woman to beat her at Wimbledon. A thigh strain hampered her in that defeat, by 6-7, 7-5, 6-3, at the hands of a woman who had just won the Australian and French Opens and was, in Williams' words, \"on a roll\". Since then Williams has emerged the winner in seven further meetings, none of them on grass. And for the record, and since somebody asked her, Serena's vote for the best legs in tennis goes to Steffi Graf."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
