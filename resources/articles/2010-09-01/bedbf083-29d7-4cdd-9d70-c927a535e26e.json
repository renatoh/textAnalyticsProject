Back in 1969 promoters used rudimentary film technology to stage a bout in which Rocky Marciano defeated Muhammad Ali. Nowadays promoters seem hellbent on arranging similar cross-generational contests, only using real fighters, rudimentary or otherwise. Haye says that Harrison doesn't merit his crack at the title. Maybe he's right. Rumour has it A-Force (what kind of nickname is that? It sounds like a laxative) only got this shot because Larry Holmes had a coach trip to Ventnor booked that weekend. The fact is, the heavyweight division has become its own Youtube. It is almost guaranteed with the big men of pugilism that no sooner have you interrupted an important rummage through the tool box to find the right allen key (even though you know it is futile, for as it was written by the ancients: \"It is easier for a camel to pass through an automated airline check-in system, than it is for a man to accumulate enough allen keys to raise the seat on a child's bicycle\") to scratch your pate and murmur, \"I wonder whatever happened to Norfolk's Herbie Hide?\" than you will read that the Dancing Destroyer has taken time out from accumulating more driving offences than Ferrari to fight at York Hall, Bethnal Green one year short of entering his fifth decade. It is not helped by the proliferation of former champions. What was once routinely labelled \"The biggest prize in sport\" has in recent years come to resemble winning a tenner on a lotto scratchcard. This has created the sporting equivalent of celebrity-inflation in the heavyweight division. Many world title bouts now elicit a similar response to Celebrity Come Dine With Me \u2013 people pointing at the screen and saying: \"I've no idea who the bloke in the white trunks is, but the other one is the Russian who got knocked out by that fat guy who lost to Michael Bentt and then went into rehab after he spent all his money on a diamond-encrusted amphibious car. Or maybe it's his brother\u2026\" Still, at least nowadays you know what you are going to get with the heavyweights. It's like listening to Radio Two: there's no chance of anyone you've never heard of popping up and making you drop your jaffa cake. It's good to have Harrison back, too. The man has the verbal boldness that is solely the province of the poet or the halfwit. When the question of his advancing years came up on Tuesday, A-Force was quick to prove that time has not withered his dauntless bullshit. He declared: \"Age ain't nothing but a number and time ain't nothing.\" Fighting talk around the Stephen Hawking household, I'm sure, though most observers will feel that at just 68 the theoretical physicist is a little immature to mix with this sort of company. It should also be noted that nobody in sport talks about his or herself in the third person with quite such magisterial conviction as Harrison. There was a time when the fighter managed and promoted himself, which allowed him to talk about Audley Harrison from a whole variety of different angles. At times Audley Harrison even referred to himself as \"we\" suggesting that Audley Harrison, \"Audley Harrison\" and possibly even Audley Harrison were some sort of team. Indeed, so distinctly separate did Audley Harrison and \"Audley Harrison\" appear that some even talked about a \"dream fight\" in which Audley Harrison took on \"Audley Harrison\" in a 12-round contest under the promotional tagline It's Id v Ego. \"They say that a man's toughest foe is himself and now we will find out if that's true,\" Audley Harrison (or even \"Audley Harrison\") might have said before such a bout. \"Obviously it is a step up in class for me, but the same is true for my opponent. We are both unbeaten but at the end of the night that will no longer be the case for one of us, or neither of us, or both of us \u2026 Can somebody hold my arm? I feel dizzy.\" Alas it seems that watching a man beat himself up just isn't box office in the US and so Audley Harrison (and \"Audley Harrison\") had instead to step into the ring with people like Danny Williams and spar with people like Derek \"One Man Riot\" Bryant, many of whom insisted on hitting them. Despite such setbacks Harrison has remained remarkably true to himselves. When the fight with Haye was announced on Tuesday, A-Force declared that it was \"his destiny\" to dominate the division. If so, the chance has come earlier than many had anticipated, the 2000 Olympic gold medallist having plotted such a convoluted and laborious course to the top it has often felt like his scheme was to establish his hegemony sometime in 2042, possibly by defeating an octogenarian Evander Holyfield after an eliminator against the ashes of George Foreman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
