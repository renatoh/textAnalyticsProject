It was at the start of his career that he had loan spells from Coventry City at Kettering and Tamworth in the Conference and, as the 27-year-old looks forward to playing his part for England in the Euro 2020 qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Bulgaria, it is easy to reflect on how far he has come. Wilson does not see it quite this way. Yes, non-league toughened him, preparing him for his rise up the divisions, and he can tell the stories of rollickings he received from managers, of how people\u2019s livelihoods were riding on win bonuses. But to him, playing for England was always going to happen. It was his destiny and it has not mattered that he has needed to take a circuitous route to the top. \u201cWhen I was on loan at Kettering and Tamworth, I said I will play for England one day. Everyone calls me self-confident. If you don\u2019t believe you can get somewhere you will never get there and it was always the aim to play for the national team and to play in the Premier League. When I got there, I felt I had been there before because in my head I had been there.\u201d Wilson was smart enough not to tell his non-league teammates of what he was about to do. \u201cThey would think: \u2018Young, little whippersnapper \u2013 coming in and saying he\u2019s going to play for England \u2013 get out of here,\u2019\u201d Wilson says. \u201cBut I told family, friends and they all said: \u2018Yes, go for it.\u2019 Some games, you would be playing terribly and I\u2019d think: \u2018No, it\u2019s never going to happen.\u2019 But you have to keep that belief there and here I am.\u201d Wilson has endured dark times, specifically those imposed by serious injury. In 2015\u201116, having started his first Premier League season at Bournemouth with five goals in six games, he ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee and was out for six months. Then, in February 2017, he ruptured the ACL in his other knee. This time he missed nine months of football. But it does not take long in Wilson\u2019s company to realise he is made of stern stuff; that the setbacks have only hardened his motivation and conviction, and now he faces his latest obstacle, a peculiar challenge that adds up to a test of his mindset. England play with one centre-forward and everybody knows who that is. So, if Harry Kane is certain to monopolise the minutes \u2013 when fit \u2013 how does Wilson approach international duty? The answer is with patience and focus. If Wilson were to come on even for one minute, he knows he could make the difference. \u201cHarry is a great player, I\u2019m not saying I want to kick him out of the team,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cBut with injuries and things that happen along the way, you have to be ready to grasp the opportunity \u2013 whether it is one minute, 20 minutes or from the opening whistle. It\u2019s not just thinking: \u2018Harry is going to play.\u2019 \u201cI like to think I can make an impact. In cup games, I tend to come on for Bournemouth as a sub and you get quite a few goals from that. Defences get a bit tired, you run in behind and that\u2019s the last thing they want to be up against. It has its pros and cons. No professional footballer will say they want to be on the bench. I keep working hard at club level to try to eventually get a starting place.\u201d Wilson has won three England caps, the first as a starter in the 3-0 friendly win against USA last November, when he scored the third goal. He came on for Kane in the other two \u2013 against Montenegro in Euro 2020 qualifying and Switzerland in the Nations League third-place play-off. \u201cYou watch how clinical Harry is in training, in the finishing sessions and there is no laughing and joking, just pure concentration,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cSometimes in club football \u2013 and I\u2019ve been guilty of this myself \u2013 you\u2019ll be doing a finishing session but having a bit of banter with the lads; having competition, laughing and joking at people missing but in a game, that is not what happens. \u201cYou have to be focused. Harry is in that frame of mind and I have taken that into my own training at Bournemouth. When I\u2019m working on my finishing there is no need to be laughing and joking. You can have banter in the changing room.\u201d Wilson has scored five goals in his last five league matches and his growing maturity is evident in his assessment of the season. \u201cI am still missing a few chances. It\u2019s about being consistent. I always like to score in the first few games and I didn\u2019t do that but I didn\u2019t get too agitated. \u201cNow, after a few goals back to back, I am in a good place. I\u2019m confident and I feel I will score all the time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
