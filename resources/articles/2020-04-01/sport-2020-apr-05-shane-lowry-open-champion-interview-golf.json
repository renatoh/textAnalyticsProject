They are mad or don\u2019t know what they are talking about. It\u2019s the most unenjoyable weekend of your life. You realise the magnitude of the whole thing.\u201d As uncertainty surrounds the next and 149th playing of the Open, Lowry\u2019s runaway success at Royal Portrush last July is worthy of further reflection. The wave of support and emotion as the man from County Offaly marched down the 72nd fairway emphasised what this meant to Northern Ireland and Irish golf. It was monumental for Lowry too, a maiden major triumph four years after he conceded a four-stroke lead after 54 holes in the US Open at Oakmont. \u201cI\u2019m not bigging myself up but in this game you are only ever one week away from greatness,\u201d Lowry says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I took Oakmont so badly; when you are in that position and you let it slip, it\u2019s so hard to take. If I hadn\u2019t won at Portrush from that [starting] position on Sunday, I still wouldn\u2019t be over it. \u201cOakmont took longer than I realised, my form went really bad after what had been a good 12-18 months. I will probably always look back and think I should have won \u2026 but everyone has one of those.\u201d Lowry was to have the last laugh, including on the United States Golf Association executive who thought it smart to draw him as part of a \u201cheavyweight\u201d three ball \u2013 Kevin Stadler and Brendon de Jonge the others \u2013 at an earlier US Open. \u201cI remember I wasn\u2019t too happy about it at all,\u201d says Lowry. \u201cWhoever came up with that idea, it wasn\u2019t a very nice thing to do.\u201d Lowry can dismiss that incident. When golf resumes, it will be fascinating to see if he can become a multiple major champion. On talent grounds, there is no reason why not. \u201cI\u2019m not happy to live off the Open,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d love to win more. I feel very lucky and privileged to have done what I did, in that manner and where I did it. Genuinely, if it all ended today it would be decent but I\u2019m a very driven and competitive person. I want to keep pushing on.\u201d Lowry\u2019s endearing post-Open celebrations, in Dublin bars and in front of 15,000 people at a homecoming in Clara, became the stuff of legend. \u201cI knew it would be a big deal but when you are living it, it\u2019s incredible,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWe are a great country when our sportspeople are doing well. Now, we have no problem kicking sportspeople when they are down as well. \u201cI used to curse the other Irish lads. All that people in Ireland asked me was: \u2018When are you going to win a major?\u2019 They don\u2019t think you\u2019ve made it unless you win a major.\u201d Lowry\u2019s smile masks a serious point about not allowing the winning of the Claret Jug to go to his head. \u201cIf I was to arrive in my hometown in a flash car, I\u2019d be dragged back down to earth fairly quickly.\u201d In early 2020 Lowry appeared to be toiling with the expectation of being the Open champion, and afforded a bunker some unwanted excavation work when about to miss the cut in Abu Dhabi. Lowry has always set himself high standards; had his mindset been adversely affected by Portrush? \u201cAbu Dhabi was very difficult to take,\u201d he says. \u201cI was defending champion in a Rolex Series event and I knew I wasn\u2019t going to play on the European Tour for a while. Before I knew it I had missed the cut and I was taken aback by it. I was hard on myself, I\u2019d be pissed off sitting in the locker room changing my shoes but by the time I\u2019m back at the hotel I\u2019m fine. \u201cIt probably looks like I take it a lot harder than I do, I show my emotions. I think I\u2019ve got really good at going out, giving 100% on that day, taking whatever comes on the chin and moving on. \u201cThe one thing I struggled with is that everywhere I went people expected me to have the burden of being Open champion. In my head I was like: \u2018Why is this a burden? This is the greatest thing to happen in my career.\u2019 I\u2019ve not set the world alight since I won but you can get very result-orientated when you do something big. \u2018Oh my God, I need to perform to the best of my ability every week.\u2019 \u201cI am mature enough to know golf isn\u2019t like that. Golf is a funny game, we are not all Rory McIlroy where we top-five every week. I\u2019ve put pressure on myself for the majority of my career anyway and if anything, I\u2019d put too much on. I don\u2019t feel anything extra now.\u201d Golf\u2019s indefinite shutdown means Lowry may well set a non-wartime record as the reigning Open champion. Yet this break will cause inevitable frustration; Lowry has dreams of a Ryder Cup debut at Whistling Straits this year when another of Ireland\u2019s famous sons, Padraig Harrington, will lead Europe\u2019s team. \u201cI\u2019ve never done it so it wouldn\u2019t matter who was captain but it would be extra special with Padraig,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to make the team and think I would be good in that environment. And it\u2019s not just making the team; I want to help win the Ryder Cup.\u201d Now 33, Lowry has spent a golfing lifetime in the company of McIlroy. The pair were amateur teammates long before majors were conquered. Lowry scoffs at the notion of one as talented as the world No 1 being a source of jealousy. \u201cI\u2019m open about the fact he is the best player in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen he has his A-game, I\u2019ve said it for years, there\u2019s nobody better. \u201cHe was always the superstar. When you get to hang around and play with the best, you learn a lot. They almost drag you towards \u2013 not to \u2013 their level. When I was playing amateur golf there were big crowds because Rory was playing. Things like that really helped me. \u201cI\u2019m a very ambitious golfer but I\u2019m not stupid. I know I\u2019m not going to win eight or 10 majors like Rory wants to win. I\u2019m probably never going to be world No 1. But I am going to go out every day and give it the best I can. \u201cIf you put me on the back nine on a Sunday against Rory or Brooks [Koepka] I\u2019d be confident of beating them but that doesn\u2019t mean I think I\u2019m better than them. I know I\u2019m probably a level below those guys but I\u2019m happy being me. I\u2019m very comfortable in my own skin.\u201d Golf\u2019s last major championship demonstrated that much."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
