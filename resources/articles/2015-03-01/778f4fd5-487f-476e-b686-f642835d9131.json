They reacquaint us with the beauty and fragility of life", "bodyText": "\u201cDoes everyone read the newspaper like that?\u201d my daughter mused recently. It was then I realised that all her life she has known her father to greet the morning with the sports section while I head straight to the obituaries. The front page usually lies unclaimed. I used to be a methodical reader. I read local news and international opinion, as well as sports and tried to keep up with the latest fashion trends and food fads. Then I became an oncologist and started losing patients at a rate faster than I had ever done in emergency, surgery or psychiatry. The phrase \u201clife and death\u201d is synonymous with medicine but nowhere does it assume a more formidable form than in the oncology clinic. Sometimes, the flourish of an oncologist\u2019s pen can salvage life or prolong suffering \u2013 you set out with the intention of doing one and end up achieving the other. My first few deaths felt deeply personal. I grappled with what I could have done to change the outcome while I waited for the bereaved family to contest my judgement or lay blame. But it never happened that way. I discovered, once the patient died, the vast majority of families never called at all. Like a bad break-up, the parting was abrupt and final. Hospitals, especially large academic centres, are anonymous places that strip patients of name and dignity. Sick patients arrive constantly and are admitted to any available bed. Tended by a virtual procession of doctors, they die without the knowledge or involvement of their primary physician. This is especially true of the public hospital system spread across multiple campuses. Doctors assume that a discharge summary or the family will notify the oncologist. The family finds it unthinkable that the calamity in their life could go unregistered by the oncologist. We may have sequenced the human genome but it\u2019s still no easier finding out which patient died when. \u201cHe died in the ambulance. Didn\u2019t they tell you?\u201d a wife explained when we ran into each other months after the event. \u201cI had no idea,\u201d I said, aware how excruciatingly inadequate I sounded. \u201cYou can\u2019t know everything,\u201d she offered graciously, but behind her gracious response I could almost touch her outrage. I took to reading obituaries to avoid being blindsided again and to make phone calls and write condolence notes when it mattered. It\u2019s endlessly gratifying to see how much stock families put in this tiny act, struck that behind the anonymous face of the hospital are real people, moved by a loss. \u201cI never thought you\u2019d know her by anything other than her record number,\u201d a tearful father once said. It was a heart-wrenching commentary on the public perception of doctors and I was glad to change it. What started as a pragmatic tool has turned into an instructive glimpse into the lives of others. George used to cry whenever he was in hospital but we never quite understood the depth of his anguish. It all made sense when he left his modest will to the local dogs\u2019 shelter where his beloved Labrador went. Gloria\u2019s obituary was published on the same day as her nephew\u2019s birth notice. As bad news started accumulating, she would tell me with a glint of steel in her eyes that she was determined to welcome the family\u2019s first grandchild. We celebrated her final victory even as we mourned her loss. Occasionally, an obituary singles out a doctor or nurse for praise. The mere notion that someone would think to pay this tribute in a time of intense grief is not only humbling but is also the spark that reignites one\u2019s commitment to a vocation. After years of reading obituaries, my turn came to write one when a dear friend died suddenly on his way to hospital rounds. I battled to encapsulate his finest attributes. But it was the practicalities that made me sympathetic to the plight of others experiencing loss. I learnt that friends can only publish a condolence after the family\u2019s announcement, which seemed sensible but it did make me wonder if this circumvented hoax. Placing a death notice is expensive. Where cost is surmountable, there is the tangle with an outsourced agency: it took an hour to patiently spell every word to a pleasant woman in an overseas office who prefaced several errors with a polite, \u201cSorry but I don\u2019t understand that word.\u201d Email was not an option. I remember feeling nervous that an awkward obituary might end up causing distress to the family but its safe publication triggered an avalanche of memories from around the world providing his grieving family immeasurable consolation. Sometimes, an obituary can magically restore friendships. Catching sight of a widowed colleague who had drifted away, I said the first thing that came to mind. \u201cI had no idea how impressive Lucy was, the whole world seems cut up about her death.\u201d His eyes moistened at the acknowledgement and thus our friendship was renewed. There is no space for \u201cdied of a broken heart\u201d on the death certificate. And yet, how else to explain the passing within hours of a couple married for 70 years? My obstetrician friend teases that while I read the obituaries he has the pleasure of reading birth notices, which typically applaud his work. Sometimes my eyes fall on these too. Both reacquaint us with the beauty and fragility of life. These days, we are principally concerned with our own selves. Ideas like success, happiness, power and influence are narrowly defined. So whether they are my patients or strangers it\u2019s instructive to identify a common theme that runs through death notices. Universally celebrated are the values of kindness, love, laughter and friendship. Humility is keenly remembered; wealth and social status come a distant second. Letters earned, papers authored, degrees conferred, no matter how prolific, rarely score a mention. This last seems particularly poignant to doctors whose days are steeped in anxiety about what to achieve next. Many people think of it as depressing but in an age where we are constantly seeking to calibrate our lives, reading obituaries seems to me an apt levelling experience. Try imagining what yours might say. I recently lost one of my favourite long-term patients. His wife had stayed in touch through his days in the hospice and called to express her gratitude to my team. That day, I bumped into a nurse who knew him. \u201cBy the way, Joe died,\u201d I said. \u201cI know, I checked the obituaries this morning.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
