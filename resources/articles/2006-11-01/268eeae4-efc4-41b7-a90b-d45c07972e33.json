Low-cost airlines and the International Air Transport Association (Iata) say that while they have their part to play in reducing emissions, plans to force holidaymakers to fly less often (either by introducing green taxes or allocating a 'carbon allowance' for each person) are not the only solution. 'The EU environment agency has confirmed that aviation accounts for just two per cent of CO2 emissions, far behind energy industries [26 per cent] and road transport [18 per cent],' said a spokeswoman for Ryanair. 'Further taxing air travel will not have any effect on reducing this minuscule contribution.' A spokeswoman from Easyjet argued that airlines were being demonised in the climate change debate: 'Low-cost airlines are an easy target; it's harder to campaign against power plants that people don't see every day or cars that they use on a daily basis.' Easyjet, Ryanair and Thomsonfly argue a green tax would only fill government coffers, and although most of them would accept a global emissions trading scheme, they say improving fuel efficiency and air traffic management would be just as effective. Iata even argues that airport expansion could reduce emissions, as extra runways would cut the amount of time planes spend waiting to land, and contends that improving air traffic control could cut carbon emissions by 12 per cent. But environmental campaigners are unconvinced. 'If the industry had read and understood the science, they'd be grounding planes, not arguing for expansion,' said Dave Howarth, campaigner for the environmental group Plane Stupid. 'The scientists say that by 2050, even if you decarbonised the entire rest of the economy, Britain would miss its conservative target of a 60 per cent cut in emissions just because of the contribution made by flying alone.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
