So will 2016 be the last \u2018white\u2019 Academy Awards?", "bodyText": "Few comedians \u2013 and none as adept at exposing prejudices \u2013 have been given a stage as politically primed as the one Chris Rock will command as host of Sunday\u2019s Academy Awards. Hollywood, a company town that loves the sound of political correctness if not the reality of equality, has for six weeks been turned upside down by accusations of institutional racism after the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences failed to nominate a single minority actor for the second year in a row. Even if this is \u2013 as some have argued \u2013 an accident of bad timing, the tradition-bound institution has sleep-walked into the diversity issue in the midst of a neurotic, election-year referendum on the nation\u2019s first black president. The Academy has reacted. Since the #OscarsSoWhite dispute over diversity and racial representation broke out in January, it has taken steps to even out representation at the body. New rules, announced at the end of January, include a commitment to double the number of women and ethnic minority members of the Academy by 2020. But will this be enough to reform the Oscars and could tonight\u2019s ceremony be the last \u201cwhite\u201d version of the famous awards ceremony? The problems may be more deep-rooted than that, in an entire industry where decision-makers are overwhelmingly male and white. Rock, who first hosted the Oscars a decade ago and who called Hollywood \u201ca white industry\u201d in a 2014 essay, has been practising his lines in a local comedy club. Pay inequality, the glut of superhero films, the Kardashians \u2013 the business is hardly short on comedic material. But nothing comes close to race \u2013 and no one is talking about anything else. Entertainment trade magazine Variety reported that Rock\u2019s routine included a joke about the celebrity couple boycotting the awards \u2013 Will Smith, denied a nomination for Concussion, and wife Jada Pinkett Smith, who have cited systemic racism in the industry as their reason for their non-attendance. Sadly, that joke may never be heard; its punchline is considered \u201ctoo lewd\u201d to get past the Oscar censors. What could be most telling, says Dr Darnell Hunt, professor of sociology and director of the Ralph J Bunche Center for African American Studies, who co-authored UCLA\u2019s recently released 2016 Hollywood Diversity Report, is what happens after Rock skewers Hollywood on race and gender discrimination and the applause dies down. Will minority viewers \u2013 38% of the population but responsible for 46% of movie tickets sold in the US in 2014 \u2013 tune out when it comes to awards and speeches by a parade of white nominees? Will they tune in to see Rock, then tune out? \u201cIt\u2019s a distinct possibility,\u201d says Hunt. If that happens it will serve to underscore his findings that minority audiences are the most important segment of the entertainment market and their under-representation is a \u201cmulti-dimensional\u201d problem that will require interventions on every stage of the business. \u201cMinorities are making little or no progress yet Latinos go to more movies than any other group, and African Americans watch more TV. Yet most movies and TV shows are less than 10% diverse,\u201d says Hunt. Oscar winner Morgan Freeman has said that while he can understand why there has been such a furore over the awards, to him it is \u201cjust noise\u201d. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to talk about diversity in the film industry, we don\u2019t need to start with the Academy Awards,\u201d he told Variety last week. \u201cWe need to start somewhere way back \u2013 with the producers, the directors, the casting agents, the writers. It should be an open field. I think in today\u2019s world, if you look out there, that\u2019s what would reflect today\u2019s America.\u201d The UCLA report found that films do better at the box office if two or three of the top eight billed actors are non-white \u2013 yet minorities are under-represented by a factor of nearly three to one among lead roles. That statistic will increase, says Hunt, as racial minorities reach majority status. \u201cThese aren\u2019t momentary glitches,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the handwriting on the wall.\u201d As it stands, he says, \u201cit\u2019s a bunch of white men making the thing they know how to make, that\u2019s consistent with their base, but does not align with where the market is now and certainly not where the market is going.\u201d African-American audiences can be more difficult to track. Straight Outta Compton, the biopic of the gangsta rap group NWA, was predicted to take $40m over its opening weekend; it took $60m and has now grossed $300m. That kind of misreading revealed a fundamental failure to understand the market and served as a wake-up call to studio executives. Even if the diversity issue is fundamentally a moral one, says Hunt, \u201cthe industry prefers to focus on the economic argument because that, in the end, is the one people will look to\u201d. That same argument is true for the Academy Awards. While the viewing public may see it as an entertainment show, it is in fact Hollywood\u2019s annual industry convention, an event surrounded by dozens of lunches and parties \u2013 the business of who you know, not what you know. \u201cThe Oscars are about making money,\u201d says Allison Hope Weiner, host of Media Mayhem, the weekly media show for TheLip.TV. \u201cIt\u2019s an advertising show. If you\u2019re nominated, you make money. Everyone at the top is trying to hold on to the power and the money. Nobody at the top is angling for stories about minorities or women. It\u2019s a question of power. You really have to look at who is green-lighting this stuff.\u201d While that may not be racist per se, the importance of the event is underscored by the fact that only two people \u2013 Mr and Mrs Smith \u2013 are staying home. Actor Jamie Foxx joked about the couple\u2019s decision last week at the American Black Film Festival awards when he called out \u2018#WhatsTheBigDeal?\u2019 and \u2018#ActBetter\u2019 \u2013 with the audience reportedly roaring with laughter. \u201cIt\u2019s not a risk for them [the Smiths] anyway,\u201d says Weiner. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll end up going to a party. If the studios want either for a role, they\u2019ll come to their house.\u201d The prevailing attitude to discrimination in Hollywood was illustrated by comments made recently by Steven Spielberg, an elder statesman of the film industry and one of its moral compasses. He said that while he was surprised the Academy did not nominate Straight Outta Compton for best picture or Idris Elba for best supporting actor in Beasts of No Nation, he dismissed the idea that racism was behind the omissions. He pointed to 2013, when Lupita Nyong\u2019o was recognised for 12 Years a Slave and the same film won Best Picture. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that there is inherent or dormant racism because of the amount of white Academy members,\u201d he said. But how to explain the disparities and how to correct them? Several studios and talent unions sponsor mentoring programmes for minority writers and directors. \u201cPeople can only get nominated if they get the work but if they don\u2019t get the work, there\u2019s no chance,\u201d says Weiner. \u201cYou have to look at the product, and you have to look at the power structure of Hollywood.\u201d There are other forces at work, however. Films are increasingly cast according to online media profiles of the actors. An actor with a significant Twitter or Instagram following, particularly among well-off segments of the audience, has a clear advantage. \u201cYour Instagram following has to be wealthy, not just a bunch of kids that don\u2019t buy anything,\u201d Weiner points out. The same issue came up when Elba was said to be in the running to replace Daniel Craig as James Bond. Follow that logic and it is not hard to see why the controversy and the #OscarsSoWhite tag has stuck to the business. The awards show is a lens on the industry: and that, in large ways or small, is a reflection on America."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
