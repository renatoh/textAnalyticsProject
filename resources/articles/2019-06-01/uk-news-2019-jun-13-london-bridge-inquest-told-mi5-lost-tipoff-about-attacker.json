Youssef Zaghba, one of three attackers who together killed eight people in June 2017, told Italian authorities when travelling through an airport in 2016 that he wanted to be a terrorist. An MI5 senior official told the inquest into the eight deaths that the error in handling the tipoff may have deprived investigators of a chance to link Zaghba to the attack\u2019s ringleader, Khuram Butt, before the atrocity. A security service investigation into Butt that began in 2015 over fears he was planning an attack did not uncover his regular meetings and contacts with Zaghba and the third attacker, Rachid Redouane, until it was too late. The families of the bereaved have accused MI5 of missing \u201copportunities galore\u201d to stop the attack. The inquest heard that Italian authorities contacted British intelligence on 15 April 2016 asking if they had any further information on Zaghba. The lost message from the Italians recounted what Zaghba had said a month earlier when trying to fly via Turkey to join Isis. He was waiting at Bologna airport to board a flight to Istanbul on 15 March 2016 and was asked by a border officer: \u201cWhat are you going to do in Istanbul?\u201d Zaghba replied: \u201cBe a terrorist.\u201d He quickly corrected himself to say: \u201cBe a tourist.\u201d The message told the British the Italians believed that Zaghba had travelled to the UK or was believed to have links to the UK. It was not until 9 June that it was translated and passed to MI6, the foreign intelligence service, and copied to MI5, the domestic intelligence service. A senior MI5 official, known only as witness L, told the inquest that the message went to the wrong person who did not realise the need to file it. Furthermore, MI5 never responded, and at that time had no knowledge of Zaghba\u2019s existence or presence in the UK, let alone any potential connection to terrorism. Jonathan Hough QC, the counsel to the inquests, asked: \u201cIt is possible the administrative errors that occurred in connection with the Italian authorities request deprived MI5 of the opportunity linking Zaghba to Butt?\u201d L, giving evidence from behind a green curtain, replied: \u201cYes it is possible.\u201d The MI5 witness said if the information about Zaghba had been appreciated then the British would have asked the Italians for more details and possibly put him on a terrorism watchlist, flagging when he entered and exited the UK. L was also questioned by Gareth Patterson QC, representing six of the victims\u2019 families, about Butt\u2019s use of the Ummah fitness centre in east London. Zaghba and Redouane also used the gym and it has been suggested \u2013 although it was disputed by L \u2013 that it may have been used to train for the atrocity. Patterson said: \u201cTo put it bluntly, if he\u2019s [Butt] going to a gym every night and you\u2019re not aware of it for many months, there\u2019s a whole range of activity that is happening without your knowledge?\u201d L said: \u201cYes, that may be so.\u201d L offered the \u201cprofound sympathies\u201d of MI5 and himself to the victims and said: \u201cEvery member of MI5, and particularly every member of my branch, comes to work every day to stop attacks like this. We know that we cannot stop them all, as we failed to stop this one, but it\u2019s our job to try to squeeze the maximum learning out of it.\u201d Those killed by Butt and his accomplices were Chrissy Archibald, 30, from Canada; S\u00e9bastien B\u00e9langer, 36, a chef; Kirsty Boden, 28, a nurse from Australia; Ignacio Echeverr\u00eda Miralles De Imperial, 39; James McMullan, 32,who was from Brent, north-west London; Alexandre Pigeard, 26, a French restaurant worker; Xavier Thomas, 45, a French national; and Sara Zelenak, 21, an Australian national. The London Bridge attack was one of four terrorist atrocities in the UK between March and June 2017. The inquest continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
