What we said: \u201cFull of subtle charm, it\u2019s an album of deceptive depths in which to immerse yourself.\u201d Read the full review Cass McCombs \u2013 Tip of the Sphere The Californian troubadour, who has steadily wound his way through the fringes of Americana and indie for over 15 years, delivers another romantic, faintly psychedelic masterpiece. What we said: \u201cMcCombs rewards deep listening. Tip of the Sphere is his ninth studio album of ever-expansive Americana, one where his myth properly matures.\u201d Read the full review The Comet Is Coming \u2013 Trust in the Life Force of the Deep Mystery With as much an affinity with hip-hop and progressive rock as jazz, the trio of reeds player Shabaka Hutchings, synth player Dan Leavers and drummer Max Hallett make one of the most cosmic statements of the current British jazz revival. What we said: \u201cThis is hardcore music for a generation weaned on rave and grime, jazz\u2019s cutting edge. The comet isn\u2019t coming, it\u2019s arrived.\u201d Read the full review Dave \u2013 Psychodrama Socially engaged and emotionally complex, Streatham\u2019s finest frets on black history and family strife with his clearly enunciated flow \u2013 but there\u2019s still a faint summery heat to tracks such as Location, Disaster and Voices. What we said: \u201cThe album lasts for the best part of an hour, and not a minute of its running time seems wasted or padded out. The end result is certainly the boldest album to emerge from UK hip-hop\u2019s renaissance. It may also be the best.\u201d Read the full review Angel Bat Dawid \u2013 The Oracle Spiritual jazz is reborn in Dawid\u2019s beguiling songs, layered from recordings made on her phone: dizzyingly beautiful runs on her clarinet are paired with keening harmonised vocals. What we said: \u201cThis is an intriguing album, futuristic in tone but hardwired to an ancient and deeply spiritual vision of what music can achieve.\u201d Read the full review Dawn \u2013 New Breed Simpler than the futuristic trio of albums that preceded it, New Breed welds musical reflections from Dawn\u2019s home town of New Orleans with spacey psychedelia as indebted to krautrock as southern screw, coupled with forthright lyrical assertions of the effort it has taken to forge her musical identity. What we said: \u201cThe music on New Breed is often hugely inventive but it also functions as pop: you get the feeling she spends as much time bulletproofing her choruses as she does tinkering with the futuristic sound design.\u201d Read the full review Deerhunter \u2013 Why Hasn\u2019t Everything Already Disappeared? Bradford Cox\u2019s outfit continue to be the best indie rock band in the US, considering everything from Jo Cox\u2019s death to environmental collapse over Kinks-y psychedelia with wit and wonderment intact. What we said: \u201cThere\u2019s a confidence about its stylistic leaps that means it feels like the expression of an authentically idiosyncratic imagination rather than someone being weird and eclectic for the sake of it.\u201d Read the full review Durand Jones &amp; the Indications \u2013 American Love Call An overlooked masterpiece of modern soul, the Indiana quintet are shamelessly retro in their style: all pert brass and crooning close harmonies. But when the songwriting is this perfect, who cares about originality? What we said: \u201cThere simply isn\u2019t a weak or even middling track, and the strongest can go toe to toe with the best of Al Green or Bobby Womack.\u201d Read the full review Billie Eilish \u2013 When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? The gothic teen queen came through with some characteristically unsettling productions on her debut album, but equally showed an unexpected love of show tunes that posited her as a Gen-Z Fiona Apple. What we said: \u201cLike a horror auteur, Eilish uses intimacy to amplify scares. She sings in a discomfitingly close gasp, like an ASMR actor having a panic attack.\u201d Read the full review Fontaines DC \u2013 Dogrel The most exciting new Irish band in a generation, Fontaines DC\u2019s songs, populated by a vivid cast of characters from yuppies to nationalists, are full of vim and vigour \u2013 but also tenderness. What we said: \u201cThis is the kind of songwriting quality that bands can take years to reach, or never reach at all: brilliant, top to bottom.\u201d Read the full review Rhiannon Giddens with Francesco Turrisi \u2013 There Is No Other The purposeful folk star Rhiannon Giddens teams with the Italian multi-instrumentalist for an album that explores how sounds and rhythms from Africa and the Arabic world connect with traditional music from Europe and America. What we said: \u201cThe project could have got suffocated in impossible worthiness, but fear not \u2013 it\u2019s wonderful.\u201d Read the full review Ariana Grande \u2013 Thank U, Next Released just six months after Sweetener, an album that channelled Grande\u2019s resilience in the wake of the Manchester Arena bombing, Thank U, Next was a looser, more experimental creative burst that delved deeper into Grande\u2019s psyche following the death of former fiance Mac Miller, and let her swaggering id run free on tracks such as 7 Rings and Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I\u2019m Bored. What we said: \u201cAs with Rihanna\u2019s Anti, this feels like the work of a pop star previously happy to act as conduit for other people, finally working out who they are and what they want to say.\u201d Read the full review Aldous Harding \u2013 Designer The finely turned folk-pop on Harding\u2019s third album was as beautiful as her lyrics were cryptic \u2013 you can join her in puzzling over what she was doing in Dubai (indeed, were she ever there) while swooning to her finger-picked nylon guitar. What we said: \u201cIt occasionally sounds like a lost Laurel Canyon singer-songwriter album from the immediately post-psychedelic era.\u201d Read the full review Holly Herndon \u2013 Proto For Proto, Herndon processed human voices through an \u201cAI baby\u201d she named Spawn, though the results remained pleasingly human: choirs spliced into fractal wonders, and on Eternal, a towering pop song to tickle the synapses. What we said: \u201cHerndon counters the hysteria around AI with an album that presents it as a quizzical, cute pet on the leash of a human master: a sensitive, responsive part of the family.\u201d Read the full review Jayda G \u2013 Significant Changes Born out of Jayda G\u2019s research as an environmental toxicologist and her clubbing life as a resident of Berlin, Significant Changes is a funky delight that shifts nimbly from exhilarating highs (Leave Room 2 Breathe) to orca-aided ambience. What we said: \u201cJayda G\u2019s own grooves are as captivating as her DJ sets, whether they\u2019re freely bathing beneath Chi-town sun or dipping into more sombre waters.\u201d Read the full review Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo \u2013 Celia Last year, the Beninese artist released an inspired full-album cover of Talking Heads\u2019 Remain in Light; this year, she turned her hand to songs by Celia Cruz, queen of salsa, highlighting the Cuban star\u2019s African roots with assistance from Tony Allen, the west African Gangb\u00e9 Brass Band, Britain\u2019s Sons of Kemet and American Meshell Ndegeocello on bass. What we said: \u201cThis is not just an album of covers but an inventive reinterpretation.\u201d Read the full review Kelsey Lu \u2013 Blood The New York-based cellist transcended her status as a collaborator with artists including Solange and Blood Orange on her stirring debut: disco reverie Poor Fake is a particular highlight. What we said: \u201cBlood is an enticingly restrained debut, showing a consistency of tone without compromising on Lu\u2019s inventiveness.\u201d Read the full review Rustin Man \u2013 Drift Code His naive, trembling voice may be a little like Robert Wyatt\u2019s, but is still a uniquely arresting instrument, haunting a series of wonderfully meandering folk-rock backings. What we said: \u201cEach instrument\u2019s contribution to the album was recorded in turn, rather than track by track, yet it sounds like an organic whole. In fact, it sounds magnificent.\u201d Read the full review Our Native Daughters \u2013 Songs of Our Native Daughters A supergroup comprising North American roots musicians Rhiannon Giddens, Leyla McCalla, Allison Russell and Amythyst Kiah: together, these banjo-wielding heroines confronted the historic and continued abuse of African American women with authority and intimacy. What we said: \u201cBut what Giddens and her cohorts have managed to create is a record of great importance and exceptional beauty, its darker moments countered by points of bright wonder.\u201d Read the full review Maja SK Ratkje \u2013 Sult One of the most plainly beautiful releases from the experimental Norwegian vocalist \u2013 using a retrofitted pump organ, plaintive ballads sit alongside whimsical flights of fancy. What we said: \u201cRatkje can write strong, vocal-led songs, such as Sayago and \u00d8ine Som R\u00e5silke, that transform this collection from background music into something that stands alone.\u201d Read the full review Lucy Rose \u2013 No Words Left Made in the throes of an identity crisis and a floundering sense of purpose, Rose\u2019s fourth record paradoxically found her at her most artistically assured, possessed of a new lyrical profundity and melodic weightiness. What we said: \u201cHer fourth album is her starkest, filled with lyrics about uncertainty and isolation, and yet her most striking, conveying the strongest sense of her artistic identity yet.\u201d Read the full review Sleaford Mods \u2013 Eton Alive The one saving grace of Brexit Britain being so utterly toxic is that Sleaford Mods still have something to write about: they remain the great contemporary poets of a nation that is much worse than it thinks it is. What we said: \u201cDespite its title, Eton Alive isn\u2019t a grand statement on the health of the nation or the ever-powerful English ruling class. It prefers to critique this troubled isle through the minutiae of daily life, which is perhaps even more effective and damning.\u201d Read the full review Slowthai \u2013 Nothing Great About Britain Another wretched yet amused state-of-the-nation address delivered in a broad, leering Midlands accent, Slowthai draws on sounds that have long chimed with the disaffected in the UK: grime, garage, punk and trip-hop. What we said: \u201cClever, bleak, funny, bracing, aware of a broad musical heritage but never in thrall to it.\u201d Read the full review Sharon Van Etten \u2013 Remind Me Tomorrow An ambitious and richly produced album, with buzzing industrial electronics newly folded into Van Etten\u2019s torrid indie-rock songcraft: here are big emotions splashed across an even bigger canvas. What we said: \u201cThis ambitious, arresting album feels like the work of an artist wielding her considerable talents with newfound confidence and conviction.\u201d Read the full review Aki Takase/Japanic \u2013 Thema Prima At 71, jazz pianist Aki Takase is more sprightly and inventive than people half her age: Thema Prima bursts with energy, with blurts of sassy big band, screwball improv and classy balladeering. What we said: \u201cIt\u2019s a wilfully intoxicating jazz brew that only Takase could have stirred in quite this way.\u201d Read the full review Vampire Weekend \u2013 Father of the Bride Returning after a six-year break, Vampire Weekend \u2013 now Ezra Koenig and a heap of collaborators \u2013 remain smart but never smart-arse. Addressing the environment, Jewishness and love, this is classic American songwriting reaches back to classic country and Paul Simon while facing forward. What we said: \u201cIt deals with many topics that have exercised songwriters of late, from the noise of social media and its bubbles to the rise of populist politics, and does so with an elegant turn of phrase: \u2018Why\u2019s it felt like Halloween since Christmas 2017?\u2019\u201d Read the full review WH Lung \u2013 Incidental Music Every other year seems to throw up its own nervy motorik combo \u2013 and this year\u2019s contenders are the Manchester group WH Lung, whose debut adds to the equation exhilarating psychedelia and compellingly obscure lyricism. What we said: \u201cIncidental Music is like a rollercoaster ride you want to get straight back on and do all over again.\u201d Read the full review Jamila Woods \u2013 Legacy! Legacy! With each track title named after a significant black cultural figure \u2013 Zora, Eartha, Basquiat, and so on \u2013 this beautiful record also draws from across the black musical spectrum: rap, R&amp;B, soul and gospel. What we said: \u201cHer contemplative, modern style of soul is built both for marching, and for recuperation, when you need to recover from the fight.\u201d Read the full review Nil\u00fcfer Yanya \u2013 Miss Universe The London guitarist hardly needed the between-song skits about contemporary anxieties to make her point on her rapturous and compellingly uneasy debut, laced with rare, bona fide indie anthems (In Your Head) and ripcord yelp shocks (Heavyweight Champion of the Year). What we said: \u201cA ragged miscellany of styles \u2013 rackety alt-rock, radio-ready pop, saxophones that appear to have escaped from a Sade album, jagged left-field guitars, primitive drum machines and what sounds like an attempt to make the kind of 80s AOR ballad that\u2019s popular with Magic Radio on a lo-fi, bedroom-bound budget.\u201d Read the full review"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
