Writing in the Telegraph in his first analysis of the public finances since Labour lost the election, Balls says \"the time for cautious silence is over,\" and calls on Labour to oppose any attempt to increase VAT from 17.5% to 20% in next week's emergency budget. His intervention is likely to play in this week's hustings for the Labour party leadership, with other candidates challenged on whether they agree with Balls and if so why they disagreed with him before the election. Balls will know that even if his rival David Miliband is sympathetic, his candidacy is supported by Darling, and Miliband could find it difficult to agree out of loyalty to the former chancellor. Before the election, Balls, as Brown's ally and long-term economic adviser, argued repeatedly that the Tories would move to increase VAT within weeks of forming a government and urged the prime minister to make clear early on that Labour would not increase a tax that hits the poor harder than the better off. Today Balls writes that he believes had his advice been acted on, Labour would have fared better. He says: \"I was one of those who privately urged Gordon Brown to make our stance on VAT explicit in the Labour election manifesto. I believed that if we made a principled case for ruling out a VAT rise, as well as against premature cuts in public spending, it would change the course of the election. \"On the doorstep, Labour candidates could have made the choice for voters come alive in a way we have often struggled to do. David Cameron's refusal to answer straight questions in the leaders' debates would have been more openly exposed. But others disagreed \u2013 and ultimately we made no hard commitment on VAT. I believe increasing VAT is plain wrong and during the election we should have said that loud and clear.\" Balls may be bringing the disagreement with Darling into the open in order to bounce him into this time agreeing with his analysis and accepting that Labour should oppose a VAT increase. He may also have been irritated with the shadow chancellor after it emerged last week that Darling had hidden better-than-expected borrowing figures from Brown, fearing the prime minister would use the windfall to fund a pre-election giveaway. While Balls was close to Brown, his relationship with Darling was troubled by the knowledge that Balls coveted Darling's job. Explaining his argument against the VAT rise today, Balls writes: \"It would be economic madness to raise VAT on top of the spending cuts the Tory-Liberal government has announced. Raising VAT will either depress spending or stifle growth, increase prices or stoke inflation, or be absorbed by the struggling retail sector. And it would be immoral to make millions of poor people, pensioners and families bear the brunt of that deficit reduction. Such a deflationary 'unemployment budget' would withdraw billions of pounds from the economy while the recovery is still so fragile, push up unemployment and put thousands of jobs at risk.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
