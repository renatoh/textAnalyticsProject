There is the intrigue of \"previous\", though, between Levein and Steven Fletcher. The Wolverhampton Wanderers forward has been left out of the Scotland party for Tuesday's friendly match against the Faroe Islands weeks after using a newspaper interview to aim one of his more accurate volleys, at Levein. Fletcher harboured a grievance over not featuring at all in Scotland's Euro 2012 qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Spain. The former Hibernian player claimed to be even more irked at not receiving an explanation for that snub from his international manager. Anyone who knows Levein will understand why such comments would not be met with merely a shrug of the shoulders. Privately, the Scotland manager has been disappointed that Fletcher dragged Charlie Adam into the row by claiming the Blackpool midfielder was \"disappointed\" not to play against the Czechs. Levein will also, and legitimately, wonder why a relatively inexperienced player chose to publicly bemoan Scotland's tactical approach. Fletcher's one appearance of Levein's tenure \u2013 in the 3-0 friendly defeat by Sweden when he was hauled off after 65 minutes \u2013 could hardly be considered a success. Yet international football management is in part a game of politics. To the outside world Levein does a pretty good job of insisting Fletcher's absence has no deeper meaning than form and a will to experiment against the lowly Faroes. \"I wouldn't read too much into it at all,\" says Levein. \"Steven isn't starting games for Wolves just now. I'm looking at a list of players I can get in, get to know what their strengths and weaknesses are and I kind of know that with Steven. I have seen a lot of him.\" Levein points out that other members of his squad, Kenny Miller and James Morrison, have aired their Scotland gripes in the recent past without any signal of retribution being sought. Fletcher, the manager insists, still has an international future. \"Everybody works in their own way,\" Levein explains. \"If someone goes on the field, works really hard and plays well then, for me, a relationship is starting to develop. If someone has played particularly well and, for whatever reason, I want to leave them out of the next match then I will speak to them. \"At this minute in time, Steven Fletcher hasn't put in a performance which makes me think I can hang my hat on him. I've been doing a managers' job for 15 years now and I've always had players, every Saturday, left out the team who are unhappy. Steven and I haven't really developed a relationship. It's probably easier for him to have a go at me because of that. \"If you are going down those lines, there are others who have criticised me. That won't have a bearing on Steven Fletcher being involved in the squad or not. Steven Fletcher is not playing for Wolves and hasn't done for a while. \"He won't be left out of any squad because he has had a go. If I didn't play all the guys who are pissed off at me for not selecting them in the past, I'd have been lucky to put a team together at times. Trust me, it isn't festering.\" Levein plans to start with another Wolves player, Christophe Berra, at centre-half alongside Gary Caldwell for the Faroes' visit to Pittodrie. To the manager's credit, this is an encounter from which at first glance he has nothing to gain but plenty to lose. \"That's always the case in matches like this,\" Levein adds. \"But I want the opportunity to work with the players again and I want to get to know them. \"I want to give people a reward for playing well at their clubs. This is an A game, it gives them a Scotland cap in recognition of what they are doing at their clubs. And if we find another one or two that can be part of the group then it has been successful.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
