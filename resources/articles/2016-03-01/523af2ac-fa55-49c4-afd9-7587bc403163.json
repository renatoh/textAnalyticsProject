His third solo record is a sprawling, expansive thing \u2013 78 minutes long \u2013 that\u2019s almost like a psychedelic journey through the day. From a gentle beginning, it slowly builds up momentum, concluding with a trio of sombre instrumentals and a Velvet Undergroundish ballad, Dreams of Sandy, that takes its vocal melody from Big Star\u2019s Kanga-Roo. (The Velvets have clearly had a profound influence on Baird: their deep, rich organ sound crops up throughout.) That might make it sound a bit po-faced, but it\u2019s not. Not only is the music consistently lovely \u2013 a warm bath of sound, where tape hiss is preferred to digital cleanliness \u2013 but Baird has a sense of humour, too. The album\u2019s most obvious standout, the lovely garage rocker Your Dark Sunglasses Won\u2019t Make You Lou Reed, warns its subject that not only will he fail to resemble Reed, but also, \u201cJohn Cale, Sterling Morrison, or even Doug Yule.\u201d Terrific stuff."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
