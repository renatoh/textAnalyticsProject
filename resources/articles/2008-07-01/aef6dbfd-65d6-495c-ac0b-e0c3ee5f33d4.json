The title refers to the exotic mixture in the film and apparently to a group of photographers with which he was associated. In as much as the film has a purpose, it is to induct into Weber's celebrity world the handsome young wrestler Peter Johnson, an innocent lad from Wisconsin whom he's photographing clothed, semi-clothed and naked for a book. Weber flicks through his collection of photographs ranging from Weston and Stieglitz to his contemporaries, shows enticing clips from his still uncompleted documentary on Robert Mitchum and shares his great admiration for the independent-minded jazz singer Frances Faye, a gay icon and cousin of Danny Kaye. The footage of her performing in film, in clubs and on TV is riveting and would alone justify a visit to the film."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
