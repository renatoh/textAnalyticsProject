Burnley's experience of embarrassment and now its sequel is such that it could galvanise Hull City but the likelihood is that Saturday's 4-1 defeat ensured a reunion in the Championship next season. Hull, according to Iain Dowie, need to win three of their remaining five fixtures, a scenario that seems as implausible as a Burnley side with one point from 16 away games and a humiliating 6-1 defeat at home in their last match winning emphatically at the KC Stadium. Besides being a role model for Hull, they can also empathise. \"I have had a few horrible weeks in my career but the most recent is the sorest,\" said Burnley's player-coach, Graham Alexander. \"It has been a nightmare week. You get hammered 6-1 at home [by Manchester City], everyone is talking pot-shots at you and you have to take it. You can't go out and defend yourselves.\" His side, however, mustered an eloquent response. A sharp strike by Martin Paterson and an added-time free-kick from Wade Elliott sandwiched Alexander's brace of perfectly precise penalties that consolidated his reputation as the division's supreme specialist from 12 yards. \"I might look cool on the outside but it's a good job you can't see my insides,\" the player-coach, stand-in captain, professional penalty taker and advertisement for multi-tasking said. The grizzled \"Grezza\", nearer his 39th birthday than his 38th, remains an admirably improbable figure, his age making his tale more remarkable. The victory came with a flurry of facts: Burnley's first away win in the top flight since April 1976; Brian Laws's second in 24 matches, including Sheffield Wednesday; Alexander's 16th and 17th successful penalties for the Clarets from 17 attempts. Yet the consequences may be greater for Hull. Despite leading through Kevin Kilbane, their capitulation left Dowie musing about the challenge. \"We know it is a massive task given the number of wins all season [six] but it can be done,\" he said. \"You turn it round by training at intensity, pressing people, working hard, getting the ball players on the ball, getting defenders to defend stoutly; all the things that make up your game, you want to do well.\" All were areas in which Hull were found wanting. Brought in to oversee a transformation in fortunes, Dowie accomplished that: this was the club's most humiliating afternoon of the campaign. The temporary football management consultant has an unwieldy job title and an unusual fondness for mixing metaphors. \"I'm not going to dress it up and tread on eggshells. We deserve to be criticised,\" he added. \"You have to put your body on the line, be brave and take it on the chin. What I want is a display with cojones.\" His side visit Birmingham, unbeaten at St Andrew's since September, on Saturday; secure their first away win and Dowie mayyetbe able to rebrand himself simplyas \"manager\" in the summer; lose and Hull could go down in a blaze of gobbledegook. ends HULL (4-4-2): Myhill 5; McShane 4 (Geovanni, 67), Sonko 4, Mouyokolo 5, Dawson 5 (Barmby, 51); Mendy 4, Boateng 7, Bullard 6, Kilbane 5; Fagan 5 (Vennegoor of Hesselink, 74), Altidore 7 Substitutes not used: Duke, Marney, Cairney, Folan Booked: Altidore, Mendy, Fagan, Barmby, Boateng Sent off: BURNLEY (4-1-2-2-1): Jensen 7; Mears 6, Duff 7 (Caldwell, 85), Cort 6, Fox 7; Alexander 8; Elliott 7, Cork 6; Paterson 7, Fletcher 7 (Bikey, 86), Nugent 8 (Thompson, 90) Substitutes not used: Weaver, Carlisle, Eagles, Blake Booked: Mears Sent off: Referee: M Atkinson 7 Attendance: 24,369 Hull Selection: Defenders Dawson and Sonko returned. Kilbane moved into midfield. Tactics: Direct but uninspired. Could have done with more flair, but created little on either flank. Game-changing: Tinkered with positive intent but a negative outcome. Burnley Selection: Retained the defence breached six times by Manchester City. Tactics: Incorporated a third central midfielder to give the defence more protection. Game-changing: Both wingers became more adventurous to increase the threat. The player (downward arrow): Bernard Mendy \u00f1 Ineffectual as an attacking force and, after being moved back into defence, unable to cope with David Nugent. The player (upward arrow): Martin Paterson \u00f1 A striker by trade, Paterson's pace and determination made him an effective auxiliary right winger. Deserved his goal. Man of the Match: David Nugent \u00f1 Arguably Burnley's best player in the humbling by Manchester City, he repeated that feat in this emphatic win. A terrific solo run resulted in the second penalty. Key Moment: 30 \u00f1 Brian Jensen blocked a shot from Jozy Altidore with his chin. Had it gone in, Hull would have been 2-0 ahead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
