The new plan was circulated to all formula one teams in a letter from Max Mosley, the FIA president, during the run-up to Sunday's Monaco grand prix. They would enable car makers effectively to nominate a second team to whom they could supply engines and that team could also score points in the new manufacturers' championship table. Such a rule could see Sauber, who use Ferrari engines, scoring manufacturers' points for Ferrari and Arrows scoring points for Jaguar with whom they currently share supplies of Cosworth V10 engines. With new regulations limiting the number of engines used over a grand prix weekend to one per car from the start of 2004, the FIA claims that car makers could afford to supply two teams for less than it costs to supply one under the current regime in which there is no limit to the number of engines that can be used. The FIA is also proposing changes to encourage teams to reduce the amount of costly testing they currently carry out. They have suggested that between 28 February and 15 November each year teams should have the option of forgoing testing in exchange for an additional two hours of free practice on Fridays at each grand prix. Those who did so would also be permitted to change engines in their cars for the start of Saturday qualifying, a luxury not available to those who continue testing independently. \u00b7 The Renault formula one test driver Fernando Alonso will try out Jaguar's R3 car at Silverstone on Thursday, prompting speculation that Eddie Irvine will be leaving the team when his contract expires at the end of the season. Irvine is 37 while Alonso is 20 and seen as one of the rising stars in the sport."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
