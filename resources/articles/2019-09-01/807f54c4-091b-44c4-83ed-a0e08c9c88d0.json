Nineteenth century solid oak doors from Antwerp City Hall lie on one shelf, while floor tiles from a postwar office block are piled up nearby, next to row upon row of ceramic toilets. \u201cForestry in the city\u201d is how Belgian architect Maarten Gielen describes the work of his practice, Rotor Deconstruction, where the wood isn\u2019t from living trees, but harvested from condemned buildings. \u201cEvery year, each Brussels resident creates over half a tonne of construction waste, while we import about the same amount of new material,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to connect the two streams.\u201d Architectural salvage may have been around for centuries, but Gielen\u2019s firm is trying to kickstart a radical shift in the way architects and builders think about construction, designing for reuse from the beginning, and changing people\u2019s perceptions of the value of secondhand materials. With global construction waste estimated to double to 2.2bn tonnes a year by 2025, most of which ends up as landfill, they are calling for an urgent change in attitudes to the lifespan of building components, and a move away from recycling towards reusing. Rather than crushing expensive paving slabs for rubble in foundations, as usually happens, why not keep the value of the material in its original form? Founded as an architectural collective in 2005, Rotor have built an international reputation for their provocative research projects and exhibitions, which often expose the hidden forces that shape our material environment. They curated a warts-and-all monographic show on the work of Rem Koolhaas\u2019s firm, OMA, at the Barbican, which included models scavenged from the bins alongside walls of client correspondence. For the Venice Biennale, they displayed worn carpets and chipped handrails from various Belgian municipal buildings as if they were precious relics. Their unlikely decision to set up a demolition company came in 2016, after years of frustration with what they saw as the architecture world\u2019s lazy approach to \u201csustainability\u201d. Operating as policy wonks as much as architects, Rotor approached the Brussels regional government and convinced the politicians to commission them to produce a new waste management plan for the region, which they crucially reframed as the \u201cmaterial\u201d management plan. The response was enthusiastic, but change was slow to come. \u201cIt takes a long time to make legislation,\u201d says Gielen, \u201cso we decided to get on with it ourselves.\u201d The first building they tackled was the former headquarters of Levi\u2019s jeans, full of partition walls framed in pale tropical hardwood, which they sold quickly and cheaply from the site, not realising their true value at the time. Now, their warehouse inventory ranges from steel keyholes for 50 cents to a pair of solid bronze doorhandles from a noted bank interior for \u20ac1,750. The work began as an incredibly labour intensive process, but, as time has gone on, the team have perfected their methods. For ceramic tiles, they now have a series of baths of biological acid that eats away at the mortar, leaving them looking as good as new and ready to lay. They recently dismantled a 1930s nursery school in Leuven, where each room had its own beautifully tiled floors, which the developer is now planning to incorporate in the new building, while other projects range from the vast World Trade Centre towers in Brussels, from which they\u2019ve prised out Carrara marble tiles and slick 1970s light fittings, to relocating the entire structure of a former horse-riding arena to be reincarnated as a waste sorting plant. It might sound like novelty \u201cupcycling\u201d, but Rotor are adamant that such repurposing must move from being a fringe pursuit to mainstream practice. As the planet hurtles ever further towards climate catastrophe and a future of depleted resources, the forgotten art of careful deconstruction is more important to relearn than ever before. Revealing the things humans can\u2019t see: The Unseen When Lauren Bowker broke her back as a teenager it left her looking for ways to articulate the pain she was living with. That set her on an extraordinary path, working with new materials to show what can\u2019t be seen. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to tap into my curiosity and to see the world through a new lens,\u201d she says. Bowker followed her chemistry degree with a master\u2019s in textiles. But what makes her approach truly unorthodox is that she combines rigorous scientific research with a personal interest in magic and the occult. \u201cFor me that just means banishing rigid thinking and fusing many different approaches \u2013 science, the natural world and artistic expression \u2013 to make seemingly impossible, fantastical things a reality,\u201d she says. Five years ago, Bowker founded The Unseen, a materials innovation company which develops molecules that change colour, whether in response to heat, light, pollution, pH level, friction or pressure. \u201cI\u2019m revealing to the world what the eye cannot see,\u201d she says. She and her team then apply these molecules in a range of fields, from purely artistic endeavours to fashion and beauty \u2013 with diverse collaborators including Est\u00e9e Lauder, Formula 1, Virgin Galactic and Swarovski, for whom she created a headpiece of lab-grown gems that changed colour according to brain activity. In the Unseen\u2019s London lab-studio, her team experiment with new concepts \u2013 \u201c95% of which never see the light of day\u201d. In 2017, they uploaded a video of Fire, an experimental colour-changing hair dye, which attracted 78m hits. Bowker is working with a global beauty brand to get it on sale. The other products in their collection include a serum that reacts to the sun to bring out temporary sun-kissed \u201cfreckles\u201d and a blusher that blushes along with the wearer. \u201cSkin is the barrier between the outer and inner person, it\u2019s alive and changing all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in using beauty as a mask but as a way to express ourselves. Mining materials for fascinating data: Institute of Making Co-director Zoe Laughlin\u2019s role at University College London\u2019s Institute of Making is, she explains, to oversee a hands-on symposium celebrating all aspects of materials and processes. \u201cMaking for me is defined as the relationship between those two,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are material enthusiasts, who love what you can do with stuff.\u201d At the heart of the Institute is the Materials Library, where samples of powders, beads and lumps are stacked. Adjacent is the workshop of lathes, potters\u2019 wheels, 3D printers. \u201cThe materials and tools are inextricably linked,\u201d says Laughlin. She describes the remit as one of inter-disciplinary, practical learning, where anyone enrolled at UCL can come in and play \u2013 \u201cbut play seriously \u2013 and trust that interesting things will happen.\u201d The idea is that knowledge can come from anywhere. \u201cWithin a university the ultimate is the peer-reviewed paper or book \u2013 written knowledge,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut there is knowledge that comes through the experience of doing.\u201d She cites how surgeons back up teaching with hands-on practice, literally asking medical students to \u201chold this, squeeze this, see how it feels\u201d. She encourages interaction between departments and allows anyone to drop in and experiment. \u201cYou could work part-time in the library or be a professor of nautical engineering \u2013 you\u2019re all welcome. You never know who\u2019s going to walk in.\u201d Laughlin explains how she might approach the subject of \u201csharpness\u201d, by bringing together a physicist with a butcher and a hairdresser \u2013 \u201cAnd I guarantee the hairdresser will say something the physicist has not thought about.\u201d She encourages visitors to push tools to the limit. \u201cWe try to make people feel at ease with breaking things because then you\u2019ve done something interesting with it.\u201d There\u2019s one firm rule though: \u201cNo weapons and no assholes.\u201d Her latest project is the Plastic Waste Innovation Hub which, she says, is about \u201cbringing together the right people and saying, we\u2019re not going to have all the answers, but this problem isn\u2019t going to be solved without working as a team.\u201d Laughlin comes from a farming family which has given her a grounded way of viewing the world. \u201cI remember having conversations where my grandpa would say, \u2018Now Zoe, when you\u2019re 50 you need to chop these trees down \u2026 \u2019 When I\u2019m seven. It\u2019s a different perception of material responsibility. I\u2019m trying to push for engineers, product designers \u2013 people responsible for making \u2013 to think of themselves as materials farmers. You come at it with a sense that there\u2019s a 50-year responsibility around this object, and you have to pass that on.\u201d Inventing clothes that will outlast their owner: Vollebak Nick and Steve Tidball abide by something they call the 99% rule. \u201cIt\u2019s that 99% of your ideas will die,\u201d says Steve. \u201cAnd we\u2019re OK with that, it\u2019s how we\u2019ve been trained.\u201d Given their success rate you can only conclude: they must have a lot of ideas. The founders of Vollebak, a startup that aims to design \u201cthe future of clothes\u201d, have already invented the Graphene Jacket, made from the only material to win a Nobel prize, the Planet Earth shirt, built for every jungle, mountain, ocean and city, and 100 Year Shorts, which won\u2019t burn, tear or get wet and are designed to outlive you. The twins combine backgrounds in adventure sports (where they ran ultramarathons across arctic and Amazon) and advertising (where they ran award-winning accounts for Adidas and Airbnb), to make high-tech sportswear that draws on neuroscience, psychology and storytelling, and is as popular with extreme athletes as it is with Silicon Valley. Their Solar Charged Jacket \u2013 whose phosphorescent membrane can absorb light from an iPhone, or any source \u2013 was named one of Time magazine\u2019s Best Inventions of 2018. With no advertising or wholesale \u2013 their shop is their website \u2013 Vollebak\u2019s biggest problem is keeping things in stock. Their 2015 decision to quit lucrative jobs has paid off. \u201cWe like risky things and we like having fun,\u201d says Steve. Last month they launched the Plant and Algae T-shirt (it\u2019s made from both, bury it in the ground and it\u2019ll vanish within eight weeks) and the Black Squid Jacket (it mimics the adaptive camouflage of its namesake). The Indestructible Puffer (15 times stronger than steel) follows in November, with the Deep Sleep Cocoon (designed to help you switch off in the most inhospitable places known to man) arriving just in time for Christmas. \u201cI think guys are open to stories. If someone says \u2018You can buy a normal hoodie, or one that can\u2019t be set on fire because it\u2019s made out of Kevlar\u2019,\u201d says Nick. \u201cThey respond to that. Developing a new leather\u2026 Are you ready for this jelly? Ma-tt-er At her studio in Hackney, east London, material designer Seetal Solanki sifts through her library. One of the materials she singles out is called malai, a substance made from bacteria in coconut water. Sourced from farmers in southern India it\u2019s a byproduct of the white flesh harvested from coconuts. The water ferments in vats for two weeks, during which time a sheet of cellulose jelly forms. Mixed with natural fibres and resins, this jelly can be manufactured into small \u201cleather\u201d goods. \u201cSome of these materials are happy accidents,\u201d says Solanki. \u201cBut mostly, each is the result of rigorous research and development. There is no point making a material just for the sake of it.\u201d Solanki studied textile design at Central Saint Martins before working across fashion, architecture, lighting and automotive design for over a decade. \u201cI always questioned my role. There was so much waste produced because material designers simply weren\u2019t fully integrated in the process. I wanted to create a place for material designers to feel understood.\u201d Solanki set up Ma-tt-er \u2013 a materials research design studio, consultancy and school \u2013 in 2015. \u201cIt begins with teaching,\u201d she stresses. The workshops, talks and courses run by the studio aren\u2019t just for designers: Solanki has helped a doctor develop a biodegradable material for tissue engineering; and a chef recently turned up with a enzyme that occurs in meat. (\u201cWe inflated it, and expanded it. It was spongy: a bit like cake.\u201d) In the workshop, different processes are applied to create new materials. \u201cSeaweed is a good example,\u201d Solanki explains. \u201cDepending on how you process it, seaweed can be a fuel, a dye, a textile, food, furniture, beauty products \u2026 We are championing this whole-systems approach to responsible materials.\u201d Solanki is also championing the next generation of material designers. Earlier this year, in association with MaDe (a European project which promotes circular economies), Ma-tt-er launched an open-call competition for designers. Of the entrants, 120 have been chosen to attend workshops throughout the year. (In the UK, these are taking place at the London Design Festival this month.) Those who make it to the next round will develop and exhibit their materials at Milan Design Week, Barcelona Design Week and London Design Festival in 2020. Three finalists will win a paid industry placement. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity I wish I\u2019d had,\u201d admits Solanki."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
