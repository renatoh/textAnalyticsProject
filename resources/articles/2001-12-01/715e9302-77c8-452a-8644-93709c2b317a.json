They would be most welcome at Selhurst Park this afternoon, where Wimbledon take on Nottingham Forest, to celebrate 'Fans United' day. In fact supporters of any club are invited, to show solidarity with Wimbledon's plight: homeless, put-upon, and desperate to fend off potential relocation to Milton Keynes, they need all the help they can get. But of all clubs, Brighton's support would be particularly meaningful, for Fans United was their brainchild, a brilliantly effective weapon during their own inspirational struggle for survival. Theirs is a heart-warming tale of a club that refused to die. Four years ago they were on the verge of extinction. Bankrupt, on the brink of falling out of the football league (having spent 203 days of the 1996-97 season marooned at the bottom of Division Three they were spared on the last day of the season), and bereft of a home to call their own after the previous owner, DIY tycoon Bill Archer, coldly sold the Goldstone Ground without making any provisions for where they would go next. The club's resurrection is a brilliant testimony to the irresistible willpower of the fans. They stood eyeball to eyeball against adversity and chased it out of town. Drawing strength from their backing, the club have risen from the depths to the summit of Division Two and sufficient stability to knock back a \u00a33 million bid from a Premiership club for their prized asset, Bobby Zamora. Brighton's miraculous recovery, based as much on imagination as determination, has become a blueprint for how beleaguered clubs can rise up to save themselves. As chairman Dick Knight points out: 'Our supporters are virtually advisers to the Nationwide League. The travails of Brighton and Hove Albion have become a parable of what can go wrong in football. But it also serves as a beacon, to show how you can fight back against the money men and the manipulators, and survive. Everything that is happening to this club is all the sweeter because of where we were four years ago.' Comparing their darkest hours to their current cheerfulness is like looking at before-and-after pictures in adverts for cosmetic surgery. To complete the makeover, though, Brighton have one crucial issue on the agenda: the stadium. It has not gone unnoticed that Archer is considering floating his business for about \u00a3300million. Perhaps, the Albion faithful wonder, he might care to redress some of the distress he caused them by donating a few million towards a new ground. They won't be holding their breath. Instead, the task of finding a permanent residence rests with Knight. He borrows a phrase penned by Brighton's most famous fan, Fatboy Slim, to describe exactly where they are now - halfway between the gutter and the stars. To continue the ascent, a new home of their own is the catalyst. 'A team going places needs a place to go' is the slogan fronting the plans for a 23,000-capacity, \u00a340m arena at Falmer, on the north-east edge of Brighton. Since being unceremoniously put out of their ancestral address four years ago, they have had no choice but to unfurl their blue and white striped sleeping bag on entirely inappropriate sofas. Two miserable years were spent lodging in far-away digs at Gillingham, and they have subsequently hired a cramped bedsit at Withdean - an improvement, but no place for the kind of more-the-merrier parties that up-and-coming Albion dream of throwing. Given their status as durable leaders of Division Two as Christmas approaches, it is not unreasonable to predict that they have a decent chance of promotion. The prospect of First Division football at Withdean is a bitter-sweet one, all the delight of ascending to football on a higher plane constantly dogged by the frustration that they could - and should - be playing in front of far bigger crowds. Even now they estimate 7,000 - 8,000 potetnial fans are being turned away every game, a figure that would rise in conjunction with the standard of football. 'If we were promoted we would try to add another couple of thousand seats but that wouldn't solve the long-term problem. There is no way Brighton and Hove Albion wants to be at Withdean in the future,' assesses Knight. Withdean, a converted athletics stadium, is not built for football. When the club moved in they spent almost \u00a33m increasing the capacity from just over 1,000 to 7,000 and upgrading the facilities to league standards. But the limitations are there for all to see. There is no accommodation for fans behind either goal, the dressing rooms are pitchside Portakabins, and the temporary main stand is removed for the summer. A proper ground is not a matter of life and death, just the difference between being fighting fit and having a permanent limp. Two months ago the club submitted a planning application for what would be an extraordinary new home. On the edge of the South Downs, it has been designed to blend into the natural environment: 'It is moulded into the hills, sculpted into the landscape, as smoothly curved as a Henry Moore. In fact the only square lines are the pitch,' enthuses Knight. 'I want to call it the Beautiful Stadium!' Unfortunately, it is not beautiful to the eye of certain beholders. Although there is considerable support for the new ground, it also has its detractors with environmentalists wanting their countryside left to its natural devices. Knight bites back: 'The Ramblers Association believe 260,000 acres of the South Downs is not enough. We only want 10 acres to build a stadium. And by the way, everyone, sport is a greenfield activity! Brighton has just become the first city of the new millennium, and whoever heard of a city without a modern stadium? There is no such arena here and my mission is to provide one for both club and community. I'm riding this rollercoaster and I'm going to stick to my principles. I'm not in this for the money. If I was I could have invested a hundred times more safely.' Persuading the political powers that be that their aspirations are as worthy as the arts festivals so keenly backed in Brighton and Hove will be another battle for the club. At least they are well practised - and the Withdean experience is yet another demonstration that the fans will do whatever it takes to help the club to be good neighbours. In the middle of an affluent suburb, they placated fearful residents by causing minimal upheaval on matchdays. They have responded to pleas to take public transport so as not to clog up the roads, and a band of volunteers go on litter patrol to tidy up once the crowds have dispersed. Friday night's postponement against Reading means Brighton need to make another concession to playing in their temporary home - splashing out on covers to keep the Withdean pitch frost-free over the winter. A club on the move deserves better."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
