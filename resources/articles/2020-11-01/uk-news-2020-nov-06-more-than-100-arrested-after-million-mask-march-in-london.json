Protesters gathered as part of the Million Mask March, an annual anti-authoritarian demonstration that this year attracted a significant number of people angry about the latest wave of Covid restrictions. Police initially struggled to control the fluid, fast-paced protest, with officers ordering those taking part to return home, and snatching some protesters from the crowd, wrestling them to the floor and arresting them. One arrested protester said she had joined the demonstration \u201cbecause it\u2019s clear the government is lying to us and it\u2019s not fair\u201d. The protester, in her 30s and from south London, who preferred not to be named, said: \u201cMy business has closed again and it was closed for six months. I managed to get nine weeks [of trading]. Last Thursday was the first day that I felt it was getting back to how it used to be, and then Saturday we got the lockdown news. \u201cI\u2019m protesting for all the people who can\u2019t see what\u2019s going on; I\u2019m protesting for all the people who can but feel that they can\u2019t go to protests because of the way that they are portrayed; I\u2019m protesting for all the people in the care homes; I\u2019m protesting for my nan, who I haven\u2019t seen for I don\u2019t know how long; I\u2019m protesting for my children; I\u2019m protesting for humanity.\u201d Pursued by police, the protesters played music and chanted \u201cfreedom\u201d as they marched and sometimes ran through the Strand, Trafalgar Square, Oxford Circus and Soho, before a large group was finally contained by officers on Oxford Street and kept there for several hours. Other groups were tackled by the police wherever they tried to congregate, particularly in Leicester Square. On Friday afternoon, the Metropolitan police said its officers had made 190 arrests for breaching coronavirus legislation. Of those arrested, 189 of were being investigated for a fixed-penalty notice and one was being investigated for a \u00a310,000 fine. \u201cAs soon as we got out of the train station it was hostile,\u201d the arrested protester said. \u201cWe were waiting to find other people and all we saw was just police chasing people.\u201d She said she ran on about six occasions in an attempt to avoid arrest, but kept losing her companions and having to stop to find them. Finally she was wrestled to the ground, pinned down and arrested. Also among those arrested was Piers Corbyn, who has emerged as a figurehead of the anti-lockdown movement and has been arrested at least four times at protests this year. A statement on his Facebook group said he was being held at Lewisham police station. DAC Matt Twist, said there was no excuse for breaching coronavirus regulations. He said a post-incident plan was in place to investigate those arrested. \u201cA significant policing plan was in place last night and officers moved swiftly to speak with those who were intending to gather,\u201d Twist said. \u201cOfficers explained very clearly the regulations and unfortunately a number of people took deliberate steps to ignore the direction. Because of this, firm action was taken and a large number of arrests were made. We will not tolerate these dangerous breaches of the regulations.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
