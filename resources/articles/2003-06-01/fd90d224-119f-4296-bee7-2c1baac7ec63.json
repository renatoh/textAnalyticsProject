That exhalation of air the moment racket hits ball is being promoted as the must-hear attraction of the game. \"Grunt if you like women's tennis\" is the strapline on one of a series of billboard posters appearing round London to coincide with Wimbledon, items which encourage fans to \"get in touch with your feminine side\". It must have been the grunt possibilities, then, that had filled the press seats in advance of Maria Sharapova's first appearance at the All England Club, rather than the fact she is the owner of legs almost as long as those of Ivo Karlovic, the enormous Croatian vanquisher of Lleyton Hewitt. At barely 16, the young Russian has already been deemed the queen of the grunt. And rightly so. Jimmy Connors, Monica Seles, Serena Williams: compared to her, they are mere mutes. Although the aural analysis conducted by those who heard it proposes that the term grunt does little justice to the full orchestral range of her vocalisations. \"It's not a grunt it's a whistle,\" reckoned one reporter. \"No, no, no,\" said another. \"It's more a sonic scream. You know, like Concorde.\" Actually, as she goes through her hugely impressive game, most of the time Sharapova sounds as if she has swallowed a swozzle, those devices puppeteers use when essaying the voice of Mr Punch; except her swozzle appears to be connected to Motorhead's old amplification system. On court No2, Sharapova was matched against Ashley Harkleroad, the 17-year-old American who herself has a collection of barks and squeaks loud enough to fell the walls of Jericho. Throw into the mix the shouts from the stand emanating from Sharapova's over-excited father and this was as noisy a game of tennis as can have taken place at the All England Club since John McEnroe decided to get serious and head for the commentary box. \"Na-yah hah-eee,\" yelped Sharapova, firing in a serve at well over 100mph. \"Grung nah,\" retorted Harkleroad, stretching across court to reach it. \"Nurg hur-weeee,\" squealed Sharapova, giving the extra push from her larynx to send back an unstoppable forehand. \"Buena, baby, buena, buena,\" bawled her father, on his feet as the ball hurtled past Harkleroad into the tarpaulin at the back of court. Try as Harkleroad might to keep pace with her, grunt for grunt, squeal for gargle, Sharapova was the mistress of the wah-hurg and the nee-hah. And it could not have escaped anyone's notice that, at the critical juncture of the second set, as she eased her way to a match-winning break of serve, the volume was turned up to 11. \"Nyareeeeg,\" she bellowed as she smashed the winner. It was a clear piece of gamesmanship, audible down Wimbledon High Street. Harkleroad was reduced to standing on the baseline, palms skywards, sarcastically shouting \"louder\". Afterwards, though, Harkleroad claimed she wasn't driven to distraction by the noise. \"She grunts loud, everybody knows that,\" she said after her straight-sets defeat. \"I was trying to make it a more relaxed atmosphere because I was getting my clock cleaned out there. A lot of girls were saying her grunt is ridiculous, and this and this and this. She does it, I dunno why. I actually grunt pretty loud too, especially when I play her. But I think she won that battle too.\" Sharapova also tried to play down the significance of the vocal tic which has already got her into trouble on her first visit to England, when she was told by an umpire during the Wimbledon warm-up tournament at Edgbaston to put a sock in it. \"I try not to make a noise,\" she said, in her perfect, Florida-accented and surprisingly quietly delivered English. \"But my mouth doesn't control the way I play. It's just a mouth.\" The question, though, is whether the grunt is a marketing tool, encouraged by those behind the posters promoting the women's game. \"I've been doing it all my life since I was four when I first picked up a tennis racket,\" said Sharapova. \"Nobody coached me like that.\" That said, like most of the women here at Wimbledon, Sharapova loves the campaign, with its lines like \"serves that travel faster than gossip\" or \"some things need a woman's touch\". \"I think it's wonderful,\" she said. \"It's a message to the world: you think men are tough and powerful and girls are sweet and pinkish, well they're strong, trying to fight every point. It's not about going out there and being pretty.\" An eloquent endorsement from a player we will be hearing a lot more of. But some people clearly are not taking on board the campaign's drive for empowerment as wholeheartedly as the Russian. Even as Sharparova spoke, all five female representatives of the host nation fell in the first round."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
