Four months after a car crash outside his Florida home set off a wave of revelations about his private life, and three weeks after hinting his absence could be prolonged, Woods said Augusta on 8 April, the opening day of the 2010 Masters, was \"where I need to be\". The world No1 has not played competitively since 15 November, when he won the Australian Masters in Melbourne. \"The major championships have always been a special focus in my career and, as a professional, I think Augusta is where I need to be, even though it's been a while since I last played,\" he said in a statement. \"I have undergone almost two months of in-patient therapy and I am continuing my treatment. Although I'm returning to competition, I still have a lot of work to do in my personal life.\" Since his car crash and the ensuing scandal, Woods has seen his much-vaunted \"brand\" severely damaged, with several companies, including Accenture and Gillette, ending their sponsorship deals with him. Estimates suggest he may have lost as much as US$30m a year as a result. Such is the public's fascination for Woods, and such is the interest in his return, it is safe to assume the 2010 Masters will be one of the most watched sporting events in history. Sean McManus, head of news for CBS, network in the US, said at the weekend: \"My only prediction is when he [Woods] comes back it will be, other than the Obama inauguration, one of if not the biggest media spectacle in recent memory.\" Billy Payne, the chairman of Augusta National, offered the club's backing for Woods's decision to make his return there, adding: \"We support and encourage his stated commitment to continue the significant work required to rebuild his personal and professional life.\" Yet if Woods, a four-time Masters champion, will receive a warm welcome from the club members, sceptics will point out that his choice of Augusta owes much to his desire to keep his interaction with the press and public to a minimum. Traditionally, the Masters limits media access more than any other tournament, and the galleries are more polite than elsewhere. Some of his fellow competitors may not appreciate having the run\u2011up to the first major championship of the year dominated by questions about Woods. Publicly, most have been supportive over the last four months but in recent weeks there has been growing irritation at the uncertainty over his plans, with Ernie Els being among those describing Woods's behaviour as \"selfish\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
