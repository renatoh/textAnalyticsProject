It is almost unbearably painful but, oh!, the flush of pride after such a feat of endurance and the sweet relief when it stops. In the final episode of Jonathan Meades on France (BBC4, 9pm), he delivered a treatise on the country's obsession with America. Or as he put it: \"This captivation with the colossus of cultural imperialism \u2026 from the y\u00e9-y\u00e9s' teenage earnestness to the gerontocratic frivolity of governance.\" I know. I know. But you just have to go with it. According to Meades, Charles de Gaulle gave up Algeria because decolonisation was fashionable in America. Undesirables were moved from city centres to outlying the suburbs, which are now left to rot by the bourgeoisie (who do not admit they are bourgeois, incidentally, because they have never forgotten their \"cobble-loving soixante-huitard youth\") because the French secretly long for their own Detroit, their own Los Angeles, their own South Bronx. And the Gauls borrow from America in general so they can avoid succumbing to the organised social lie they tell themselves and the outside world, that the nation is still the implacable, slow, civilised, beautiful place it used to be. According to Meades, I said. You may agree wholeheartedly or violently disagree. I doubt he cares a jot. The whole thing \u2013 which is just Meades talking in his trademark monotone to camera in different cafes, by different roadsides or outside places of architectural interest \u2013 is mesmerising. At times he comes across as a lettered, affectless Jeremy Clarkson (France's car dependency gives the lie to \"that universally preached, seldom practised, utterly trite and entirely unrealistic doctrine of sustainability,\" says Meades, with as much feeling as if he were reading out a recipe for cr\u00eapes suzette. \"If France voted as it speaks it would be governed by a coalition of green Maoists and Khmer Rouge provisionals.\") At other times he is like a man trying to poo a dictionary, but in the main it works brilliantly. It is distinctly different and distinctly thrilling to be addressed by someone who isn't afraid of words, abstract thought or of yoking the two together and setting himself up as the last working homme serieux in the west. It is impossible to tell if his shtick is needless belligerence, playful contrarianism, powder-dry wit or heavy flippancy, if he was endlessly bullied at school or not bullied nearly enough. As I say, you just have to go with it. Whatever he is doing and however he is doing it, he will make you think. And by the end you feel as bruised and exhilarated as if you had been battered by a rough sea but washed up safely on a slightly different shore from the one on which you started out. Bouncers (Channel 4, 10pm) was an easier proposition \u2013 a documentary following the lives of a group of men with the unenviable task of policing the portals to the nightclubs of Newport, south Wales. They scan, with a look of weary contempt, the unsteady, unrestrained Jager-bombed gaggles of girls and boys seeking permission of the gatekeepers to pass from Sodom to Gomorrah. It is up to Joe, Jamie and Geraint to decide who is likely to be more trouble than they're worth and who still has sufficient spending and drinking capacity to be let in. Only the trained eye can tell. Sometimes they have to throw people out. \"She said to me: 'Am I barred?'\" recalled Joe mistily. \"I said: 'I've just found you in the men's toilets taking a shit while you suck your bloke off. Of course you're barred.'\" It is a measure of \u2013 well, quite a lot of things \u2013 that until Joe had finished, you really weren't sure what his reply was going to be. Via such bleak yet vivid anecdotage did the film manage to paint a detailed, compelling and sympathetic portrait of a town ground down by poverty and a populace clearly drinking to forget. To make ends meet, Joe \u2013 formerly a high-earning insurance underwriter until the credit crisis took his job and everything else from him \u2013 worked in a pawnbrokers. \"It's a right kick in the teeth, of course,\" he said. \"But there's always someone worse off.\" And he met most of them \u2013 hocking their jewellery by day and drinking the proceeds by night. When he left school, with 11 GCSEs and his A-levels, the jobcentre told him they could only put him on a training course if he had a criminal record. He didn't. \"I'm angry at how the system has failed, to be honest with you,\" he said. At least the documentary did him proud."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
