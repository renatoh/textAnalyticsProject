While oil prices yesterday broke new records and reached $47.96 (\u00a326.19) a barrel in New York, the World Gold Council reported an 11% rise in volumes - 25% in dollar terms - during the second quarter, compared with the same period last year. Demand for gold in Britain fell 5% as consumers cut spending in anticipation of harsher interest rate rises, but it leaped 12% in Saudi Arabia, while the UAE and other Gulf states saw an 11% rise. China and Vietnam showed 30% and 50% rises respectively, but these figures seemed better because the Sars virus depressed demand in 2003. Other factors helping the overall global demand rise in tonnage terms was stronger global economic growth, the relative absence of price volatility and continuing concerns about the long-term commercial and political outlook. However, there have also been big promotional pushes in markets such as China, where a television advertising blitz has been launched. \"We believe our promotional activities have clearly helped to boost demand in major markets such as Turkey, China and India,\" said James Burton, the chief executive of the WGC. The price of gold rose in New York by more than $3 per ounce to reach $410 yesterday, with traders saying it was being boosted by a combination of the faltering dollar and booming oil prices. The $47.96 a barrel for US light crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange was up about 70 cents on the closing price the night before, and came despite reassuring developments in the Middle East. Iraqi oil minister Thamer al-Ghadhban said his country was prepared to resume pumping its capacity of 1.7m barrels a day soon from its level of 1m barrels as southern production came back on stream. The latest rally in the price of crude started with Wednesday's report from the US energy department confirming falling gasoline stocks while supply disruption concerns remain in Russia and Venezuela. The soaring price of crude has worried economists, who feel it will damage world economic recovery. While many have predicted that prices will soon breach the $50 per barrel level, some analysts believe the supply fears are being exaggerated by speculators."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
