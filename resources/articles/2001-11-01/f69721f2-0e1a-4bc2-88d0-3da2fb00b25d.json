The Springboks, lacklustre in their defeat by France last weekend, fielded a largely experimental side and fell behind 9-0 early on through the boot of Diego Dominguez. But South Africa soon started to dominate with tries from Joost van der Westhuizen and Dean Hall and by the time the centre Trevor Halstead scored his first try for South Africa in first-half injury-time Italy's resistance had crumbled. The Springboks scored five more after the break through John Smit, Victor Matfield, Willie Meyer, Bobby Skinstad and Halstead. Dominguez, who scored 19 points, and Marco Bortolami, following a charge-down from Louis Koen's attempted clearance in injury-time, scored consolation tries for the Italians who are still struggling to keep up with the world's elite. \u00b7 Newport's scrum-half Dale Burn scored three of their nine tries as Uruguay, starting the game with 11 internationals in their line-up, opened their tour of Wales with a comprehensive 59-5 defeat at Rodney Parade yesterday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
