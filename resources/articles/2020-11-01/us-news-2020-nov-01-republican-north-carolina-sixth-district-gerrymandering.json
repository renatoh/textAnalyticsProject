In 2016, Republican state legislators had drawn a line down Laurel Street, which runs through the middle of campus, effectively dividing the nation\u2019s largest historically black university into separate congressional districts. Walking from the library to the dining hall, Cobb would frequently cross from the state\u2019s sixth district over into the 13th, both represented by white Republicans: Mark Walker and Ted Budd. Cobb, now a sophomore, remembers first learning about the distinct districts from student groups that were organizing calls, protests and even a visit to Walker and Budd\u2019s offices in Washington DC. However, after a court decision late last year, for the first time since 2012, the university\u2019s students will be voting in a general election under the umbrella of a single district. The newly minted sixth district, which includes all of A&amp;T as well as the largely Black cities of Winston-Salem and Greensboro, is one of two North Carolina congressional seats likely to flip in favor of Democrats in the election. In the other \u2013 the state\u2019s second district \u2013 Republican incumbent representative George Holding announced after the 2019 redistricting that he would not be seeking reelection. Cobb, who is 19 and studying political science, cast her vote on the first day of early voting at a polling station on campus. The station itself was another fight \u2013 last fall, dozens of A&amp;T students packed the county\u2019s board of elections meetings to lobby for a voting site at the university, a request that was eventually granted. These forms of suppression, intentional or not, made voting feel even more important, Cobb said. \u201cAs African Americans we pride ourselves in voting, because that\u2019s what our ancestors fought for,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I will never forget.\u201d More than 37,000 people aged 18-29 have already voted in the sixth district, nearly twice the tally recorded in 2016. Statewide, of the 3.3m votes cast, 12% have come from Cobb\u2019s age group, up more than a point over 2016. Rachel Weber, the North Carolina press secretary for voting advocacy group NextGen America, said she believes the uptick can be explained by young people feeling the effects of the political world on their day-to-day lives more than ever. \u201cWe have lived through four years of an administration that has attacked the issues near and dear to our hearts, whether it be racial justice or affordable healthcare,\u201d Weber said. \u201cPolitics are closer to young people right now.\u201d Students at A&amp;T rallying against racially biased districting and maps \u201cthat don\u2019t represent us and where we live\u201d is a prime example of the youth activism and political engagement endemic in the current election, she added. A&amp;T has a long history of organizing around politics and racial justice: the Greensboro Four \u2013 the group of Black activists whose sit-ins in 1960 at a local department store helped further the civil rights movement \u2013 were all students at the university. But in the past year, gerrymandering has been added to the list of seemingly evergreen conversation topics on campus that include economic inequality, criminal justice reform and systemic racism, said Derick Smith, a political science lecturer at the university. \u201c[Students] became personally aware and highly agitated that they were being targeted by this particular suppression method,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThey felt like diluting their voice and their vote was criminal.\u201d The 2016 move to split the campus came after Republican legislators were forced to remake North Carolina\u2019s congressional maps after a US supreme court ruling deemed the previous ones unconstitutionally gerrymandered. Legislators freely admitted, however, that they would draw the new maps intending to consolidate and water down certain voting blocs, including the state\u2019s roughly 1.5 million Black registered voters. \u201cWe want to make clear that we, to the extent, are going to use political data in drawing this map, it is to gain partisan advantage on the map,\u201d the Republican legislator David Lewis said at the time. \u201cI want that criteria to be clearly stated and understood.\u201d Those maps were likely \u201cextreme partisan gerrymanders\u201d a panel of North Carolina judges found last year, forcing legislators again back to the drawing board. The current maps were finally approved by judges in December. Smith said he\u2019s already seen impacts from the redistricting. Congressional candidates have been spotted around campus and in the community, something that rarely happened when the area was a surefire Republican stronghold. But there is still work to do, he added. Following the 2020 census, the state will have to once again come up with new congressional and legislative districts. To avoid racism and partisan bias, Smith said, the state should look to models such as California and Colorado, which have shifted the responsibility for district line-drawing from politicians to citizens or independent bodies. \u201cThe citizens should have a greater role in drawing these maps as they affect their lives,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a spoils system for the party that wins an election \u2013 in a Democracy, they shouldn\u2019t be picking their voters.\u201d Without any sort of protections in place, A&amp;T is just one of many communities across the US that will continue to not receive fair and equal political representation, he added. \u201cThere\u2019s no way the fate of Black voters should be left up to partisan design, because we\u2019re going to lose every time,\u201d Smith said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
