After weeks of market rumours, Rio confirmed yesterday it had recently received an all-share indicative offer, which had been swiftly rejected. BHP said it was continuing to push for a meeting to discuss its proposals. The spurned takeover approach marks a breathtaking first move for 45-year-old Marius Kloppers, who was promoted to the post of BHP chief executive only last month after the retirement of his mentor Chip Goodyear. Mr Goodyear had run the company since 2003, when his predecessor, Brian Gilbertson, resigned after failing to persuade BHP chairman Don Argus to back a planned bid for Rio. Mr Argus is firmly behind the latest approach. Both companies have major listings on the London Stock Exchange but also have strong roots in Australia where many of their mines are located and where they form a central pillar of the economy. A combination would underscore Australia's vital role in supplying iron ore to China's insatiable steelmakers. While Brazilian firm CVRD is currently the world's largest iron ore supplier, with about 36% of the global market, Rio and BHP's Australian operations are the number one and two suppliers to China, benefiting from comparatively low shipping costs. A merger would give them a global share similar to that of CVRD. China accounts for about 40% of world iron ore consumption. Some City analysts believe it will produce more than 480m tonnes of steel this year, double the production levels of 2003. BHP wants to offer three shares for every Rio share, valuing Rio at a premium of about 20% to Wednesday night's closing share price. At that price it would be the biggest takeover since Vodafone bought the German mobile phone group Mannesmann in 2000. But Rio rejected the indicative offer saying it \"significantly undervalues Rio Tinto and its prospects\". BHP nevertheless said yesterday it \"intends to continue to seek an opportunity to meet and discuss its proposals with Rio Tinto\". Last night Rio shares closed up 946p, or almost 22%, in London at \u00a352.96. The prospect of the merger of the world's number one and number three mining groups by market capitalisation sent a wave of speculative buying through other mining stocks. Among the risers were Anglo American, up 474p, or 15%, to \u00a336.45 and Xstrata, up 348p or almost 11% to \u00a335.73. BHP closed down 100p at \u00a316.56. A union of BHP and Rio would be unlikely to please Chinese steelmakers, led by Baosteel. They are already in tense annual negotiations with the two Anglo-Australian firms and others to set the price for iron ore next year. Mining groups are pushing for rises of up to 50% and believe they have a strong negotiating hand. While there may be little that the Chinese competition regulators can do to block the possible union, analysts believe disgruntled customers may be appeased by the offer of minority stakes in certain assets, if a deal eventually materialises. Other competition issues could be satisfied by selling off assets. Analysts' conservative estimates suggest cost savings from a takeover of Rio would come to more than $500m, with much of that coming from the two groups' operations in Pilbara, Western Australia, where they operate neighbouring iron ore mines with parallel rail and port facilities. The values of iron ore mines, and potential synergies from them, are likely to prove central to any takeover discussions should they materialise, but BHP and Rio also have overlapping operations in copper, coal and aluminium. Nevertheless, BHP said: \"In preparing its proposal, BHP Billiton has examined in detail the regulatory issues and other practicalities of a combination.\" Rio, meanwhile, made no mention of regulatory obstacles to a merger in its rejection statement. The dealmaker Marius Kloppers, BHP Billiton's chief executive, might only be 45 years old and have been in the top job for less than 40 days before launching one of the biggest potential mega-mergers in corporate history, but he knows all about takeovers. He played a key role in the merger of BHP of Australia with South Africa's Billiton six years ago and was responsible for integrating the two companies. But he is not well known outside the London-listed group. BHP Billiton's public profile has, in the past, been dominated by Mr Kloppers' smoothly efficient American predecessor, Chip Goodyear. The South African might not seem to have the immediate charm of Mr Goodyear, but he is considered tough and straightforward, as might be expected from someone who spent two years in the army and was always a keen rugby player. The BHP boss certainly has the brain power to run what would be the world's biggest mining house. He has an impressive international academic record. He studied chemical engineering at the University of Pretoria before a Masters degree at Mintek, the mining research institute in South Africa. He has a PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an MBA from Insead, the elite business school at Fontainebleau, outside Paris. One of his first jobs was with McKinsey, the management consultancy, but he left to get his hands dirty with real mining operations at South African group Gencor, which morphed into Billiton, where he became marketing director in 1997. As a former rugby player, he is a man who knows how to sell a good dummy. At BHP's annual meeting two weeks ago he said there would be no overall change in company strategy. There was not a hint of a mega-merger in sight. \u00b7 Terry Macalister"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
