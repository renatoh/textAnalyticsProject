The Chelsea manager has witnessed a lot during a decade in the dugout but watching his misfiring team succumb so meekly to a side who had recorded just one away victory last season surely must have been a new experience. After a strange summer that has seen his employers spend the best part of \u00a3130m on new players yet go into the title defence looking considerably weaker than the outfit who swept all before them just a few months ago, the Italian then found himself fielding questions that suggested he had deliberately sabotaged his starting lineup in a bid to send a message to the club\u2019s owner. Conte bristled visibly at that accusation, staring down his inquisitor before insisting \u201cyou don\u2019t know me very well\u201d, although quite what Roman Abramovich would have made of it all is anyone\u2019s guess. \u201cNo I\u2019m not worried, because it\u2019s normal,\u201d Conte said later. \u201cIt\u2019s important for me not to close my eyes, but to focus on our mistakes and to try to work to improve.\u201d Almost two years to the day before, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho had stood in the same dugout and watched his reigning champions begin their title defence by having a player sent off and subsequently failing to see off a visiting team expected to struggle. Save for Mourinho\u2019s outburst at team doctor Eva Carneiro that proved to be the beginning of the end of the Special One\u2019s second coming, that 2-2 draw with Swansea had many parallels to Saturday\u2019s shock defeat, with Gary Cahill this time playing the part of Thibaut Courtois in being dismissed early on another sunny afternoon in west London. But while Mourinho\u2019s ire had only increased after the final whistle on that occasion, a second-half comeback that almost rescued a point seemed to help his successor find his focus once more, even if the manner in which Chelsea had imploded after the England defender was sent off in the 14th minute for his studs-up challenge on Defour will be of great concern for Conte. He did reveal some frustration by suggesting they would need to work on a new formation \u201cwith nine players\u201d after Cesc F\u00e0bregas was also dismissed late on. The latter\u2019s suspension for the trip to Wembley to face last season\u2019s runners-up, Tottenham, on Sunday, coupled with the continued absence of injured \u00a340m signing Ti\u00e9mou\u00e9 Bakayoko, leaves a gaping hole in midfield that even a master tactician such as the former Juventus and Italy manager will find difficult to fill. Having loaned out 26 players so far and having sold Nemanja Matic and Nathaniel Chalobah, there is no real excuse and even with Chelsea expected to make a renewed attempt to sign Leicester\u2019s Danny Drinkwater and their interest in Barcelona\u2019s Sergi Roberto, Conte put the ball firmly in his employers\u2019 court before a match that, even at this early stage, could help to define their season. \u201cThe club is trying to do their best in the transfer market,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a coach and now the season has started so my focus is just on the pitch and working with my players. This is my squad and this is my team and I want to fight with these players. The club is doing the work.\u201d On Spurs, Conte said: \u201cWe have one week to try to find the right solution. For sure, this game will be really tough but we must be ready. We must be ready. We must have the same will, the same desire to fight as the second half. I think we have to restart from there.\u201d By contrast, his counterpart Sean Dyche rightly revelled in his side\u2019s achievement \u2013 which continues their remarkable record of having defeated the champions in each of their four seasons in the Premier League. The sales of Michael Keane and Andre Gray for a combined \u00a343m would have knocked the stuffing out of most teams in the lower reaches of the division but it is a credit to their manager that they were deserved winners against Chelsea. Reinforcements in the form of the French defender Nicolas Isimat-Mirin from PSV Eindhoven and Chris Wood of Leeds could be on their way, although Dyche \u2013 who was a candidate to replace Sam Allardyce at Crystal Palace before they opted for Frank de Boer \u2013 would happily settle for what he already has. \u201cWe\u2019ve had it happen many times since I\u2019ve been at the club. Almost every year, every other year, arguably some of the best players go out of the building,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not ideal, of course. Nobody wants to lose their best players. It\u2019s a reality of this club and some of the challenges it faces. It\u2019s not something I want to happen, but it happens. But it\u2019s more about focusing on what you\u2019re then going to do next. I\u2019m not really one for crying at anything. I tend not to cry too much.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
