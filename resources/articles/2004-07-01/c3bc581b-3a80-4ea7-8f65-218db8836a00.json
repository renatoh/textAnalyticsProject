The Jockey Club has launched an inquiry into the disclosure, which has come as an immense embarrassment to the leading owner Prince Khalid Abdullah, who bred and owned Endless Summer. Although Prince Khalid was unaware of the deception, Philip Mitchell, the manager of his Juddmonte Farms stud, has admitted that while he registered Endless Summer as having been foaled on January 2 in 1998, the colt was in fact born a week earlier. Since the racing industries in the northern hemisphere operate a strict rule that a horse's official birthday is January 1, this meant that Endless Summer became a yearling less than a week after he was foaled, and was technically a three-year-old when he ran in some of the season's top events for juveniles. \"It would be totally impractical for us to do anything other than simply record foaling information provided to us,\" Paul Greeves, of Weatherbys, said yesterday. \"Short of having closed circuit television in every foaling box in the country, there is no practical way that we can monitor the exact date when a horse is foaled.\" It seems inevitable that Endless Summer - who was a failure at stud and is still racing in Britain - will be retrospectively stripped of his success in the Group Two Richmond Stakes. His subsequent second places in the Middle Park Stakes and the Prix Morny, both Group One events, may also be forfeit. It is almost unprecedented for a case of late registration to be brought to the attention of the authorities, but there is little doubt that dozens of thoroughbreds every year are foaled in December, only to be registered with the Stud Book in January. \"The trouble is that the 11-month gestation period of the horse means that in order to get your horses born as soon as possible after, but not before, January 1, the official covering season for thoroughbreds starts on February 15,\" Dr Twink Allen, the director of the Equine Fertility Unit in Newmarket, said yesterday. \"That is appreciably before the natural physiological breeding season of the mare, and a major function of our research group and other around the world has been to develop treatment regimes to overcome that. \"We have been remarkably successful, in that by using artificial lighting and a combination of hormones, we can now ensure that the vast majority of non-pregnant thoroughbred mares can ovulate between February 15 and February 28.\" Since the thoroughbred has a normal gestation period of between 315 and 360 days, a mare covered on February 15 might be expected to deliver her foal at any time from December 27 onwards. \"To have an arbitrary hard-and-fast rule that debars a horse simply because it's born two days early is an obvious farce,\" Allan said, \"but you have to draw the line somewhere.\" One filly who will be much sought after as a broodmare in due course is Attraction, the dual Guineas and Coronation Stakes winner, who was one of nine entries yesterday for the Falmouth Stakes at Newmarket on Tuesday. She is 4-9 with Ladbrokes while Soviet Song, a neck second to Refuse To Bend at Royal Ascot, is 5-1 and Favourable Terms 7-1."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
