Jim Benvie, spokesman for the Guardian Patriots, a militia that has been camped at the border near Sunland Park, New Mexico, was arrested on Friday in Oklahoma after a warrant was issued on Wednesday in southern New Mexico. The US Department of Justice filed two federal charges, alleging that Benvie, 44, passed himself off as a border patrol agent in mid-April. It was the second arrest to target members of armed groups that have been patrolling the border near Sunland Park since February. In recent years, there have been growing reports of paramilitary groups and xenophobic activists surveilling the US border with Mexico, working to intercept undocumented people trying to cross into the United States. The groups in New Mexico have previously presented themselves as \u201cvolunteers\u201d aiding border patrol andsupporting Donald Trump. News photographs taken in March showed Jim Benvie wearing a camouflage jacket with a badge reading \u201cFugitive Recovery Agent\u201d and a patch with an eagle-head insignia. Several livestream videos posted by Benvie to Facebook in April documented some of the actions of the Guardian Patriots in New Mexico. One video appeared to show the militia ordering around a large group of migrants, including many children, and telling them to sit on the ground. As he filmed the migrants kneeling in the dirt, Benvie narrated: \u201cThere\u2019s no border patrol here. This is us.\u201d A second video appeared to show Benvie stopping a group of migrants, including several children, saying \u201cborder patrol\u201d to them as he approached, before calling for another member of the Guardian Patriots to join. A second man who arrived wearing camouflage pants then ordered the migrants to sit on the ground. The men subsequently appeared to call border patrol, with one saying, \u201cHello, I\u2019ve got seven over here.\u201d The militia members advocated for Trump\u2019s proposed border wall on the video streams and echoed the president\u2019s anti-migrant rhetoric, warning of an \u201cinvasion\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s very dangerous people here. That\u2019s the reason we carry guns,\u201d Benvie narrated on the second video just before encountering the group. \u201cThis is why we\u2019re here, guys. \u2019Cause there\u2019s no border patrol.\u201d In a letter to state officials following the incidents, the ACLU said the militia had targeted nearly 300 migrants in Sunland Park. Stephanie Corte, an immigrant rights campaign strategist with the ACLU in New Mexico, told the Guardian on Monday that the video evidence was clear and she was glad officials finally responded: \u201cI feel relieved for any of the migrants who might be coming through right now \u2026 These vigilante groups are very, very dangerous. They don\u2019t care for the constitutional rights and basic human rights of migrants.\u201d In Reuters interviews earlier this year, Benvie denied his group posed as border patrol agents and said he was a citizen journalist documenting proof of the need for the border wall promised by Trump. William Early, an Oklahoma public defender representing Benvie, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Benvie remains in federal custody pending a detention hearing scheduled for Tuesday in Oklahoma before his full trial begins in Las Cruces, New Mexico. He also faces a fraud charge in Oklahoma for allegedly running a child-cancer charity scam. In May, the Guardian Patriots split from another armed group on the border, the United Constitutional Patriots (UCP). Larry Hopkins, the leader of the UCP, was arrested in April on charges of being a felon in possession of firearms. \u201cToday\u2019s arrest by the FBI indicates clearly that the rule of law should be in the hands of trained law enforcement officials, not armed vigilantes,\u201d the New Mexico attorney general, Hector Balderas, said in a statement at the time. The ACLU in New Mexico described the group as \u201can armed fascist militia organization\u201d made up of \u201cvigilantes\u201d, saying they were working to \u201ckidnap and detain people seeking asylum\u201d and had directly made illegal arrests and held migrants at gunpoint. Corte said she feared the arrest would not stop other armed vigilantes from traveling to the border, especially as Trump intensifies his anti-immigrant rhetoric on the campaign trail. \u201cThey are saying, \u2018I responded to a call by my president, and I came down to fight this invasion,\u2019\u201d she said, adding that border patrol agents have to \u201cactually do their jobs and stop this\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
