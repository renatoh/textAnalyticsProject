And yet he still says nothing. Given that he has been held hostage by his minders for the past few months, it was only fair that Boris Johnson was given the chance to answer the first question on the BBC\u2019s Tory leadership debate. \u201cPiffle, paffle, wiffle, waffle,\u201d said the pasty-faced, priapic Mr Blobby. His time in captivity has played havoc with his complexion. And with his thought processes. Asked to explain if he would leave the EU on 31 October, Johnson managed to both say he would and he wouldn\u2019t. Much the same as he has been telling both his remainer and leaver supporters. Only the public are less gullible than some Tory MPs. \u201cPoliticians need to act seriously and soberly,\u201d he concluded, trying to remember not to smirk. Thereby in effect ruling himself out as the UK\u2019s next prime minister. Only for Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove and Sajid Javid to do much the same. Rory Stewart sounded a little less deranged, but his Brexit plans don\u2019t stand much scrutiny either. It was all downhill from there. The five men were all sitting on stools, as if they were an ageing boyband performing a one-off reunion gig. Take Twat. Ten minutes in, Stewart began to undress by taking off his tie and that\u2019s when the old artistic differences really kicked. \u201cYour ideas are really shit,\u201d said one. \u201cNo they\u2019re not,\u201d said another. \u201cIt\u2019s your ideas that are shit.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s my turn to be on lead vocals.\u201d \u201cWell stop singing out of tune.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re back on the coke.\u201d The entire audience, which was already rapidly thinning out as more and more people switched over to repeats of Chernobyl for light relief, wished they were back on barbiturates. At one point, the presenter, Emily Maitlis, looked as if she too had had enough and wanted to walk off the set. But her professionalism kicked in as Take Twat continued to talk over one another and squabble among themselves. \u201cHas that answered your question?\u201d Maitlis asked James from Belfast after Mr Blobby and the Blobbettes had argued over GATT 24, sheep farming and other things about which they clearly knew nothing. \u201cNot really,\u201d said James, committing hara-kiri. He spoke for an entire nation. Having given up any hope of getting a straight answer on Brexit, other questions came in on tax cuts, Islamophobia and public services. Bizarrely, one man even thought Hunt had given a satisfactory reply. Ken Doll lookalike Hunt appeared amazed by this. It wasn\u2019t his style at all. \u201cCould you just tell me whether my husband will be OK?\u201d pleaded Carmela from Southampton. \u201cYour husband is toast,\u201d snapped Gove. \u201cHe can piss off and die. Now stop talking while I\u2019m interrupting.\u201d It was a relief when it all ended. Not even a near-naked, straight-talking Stewart could chalk this one up as a success. All the country had learned was that it wished they would all shut the fuck up and it didn\u2019t want any of them as prime minister. The only winner on the night was Jeremy Corbyn. The final line up for Take Twat had been decided at the second round of voting earlier in the day. Yet again Stewart had been the first candidate to show his face and remained in the corridor throughout the two hours. Pacing, pacing, always on the move. Walking is what he does. Was he feeling confident? If he told you, he\u2019d have to kill you. Wet jobs R\u2019Us. \u201cAh,\u201d he said. \u201cThere goes Damian Green. Just the sort of person who would vote for Boris unless I look him in the eye.\u201d Too late. Green had already voted for a return to cabinet. Dominic Raab came and went without saying a word. As did Boris Johnson. \u201cCan\u2019t you even smile?\u201d someone asked. He couldn\u2019t. It was more than the job he wanted was worth. He\u2019d almost certainly screw up at some point, but not just yet. Ken Doll forced a grin. Gavin Williamson had promised to loan him some of Boris\u2019s votes to make sure he was safe. The Team Boris camp had banged the table enthusiastically when Matt Hancock turned up. Quite how the health secretary sleeps at night is anyone\u2019s guess. He must have been promised one hell of a promotion. Rumours are that he wants to be chancellor. Which could be a problem as Boris has already promised that to several other of his supporters. It looks like a Johnson government is going to involve a lot of family-friendly job sharing. Then came the result. Hunt and Michael Gove had stalled, Sajid Javid\u2019s dog had just scraped over the line. Raab was out and the police were out in force in case he went on a killing spree in Westminster. So much pent up anger surely had to be released. The only one to have outperformed expectations had been Stewart. The pacing had paid off. The outsider 007 would live to die another day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
