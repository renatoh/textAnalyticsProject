Hatton comes across as a smart guy and I hope that, as well as achieving his goals, he'll recognise when to hang up his gloves before the sport he clearly loves starts to do him long-term damage. Andrew Buckingham London E8 Roughly 50 years ago, when I was about three, my mother and I took refuge in a red phone box while an escaped bullock stamped and snorted outside (Magic Box, November 17). We'd gone to Huddersfield's market when the beast escaped from the nearby slaughterhouse. Everybody disappeared, but with me in tow my mother could not run, so we were left alone with it - and it was angry! We stayed in the box for some minutes until the animal was recaptured. Richard Fowler By email It was interesting to see the photograph of Peter Higgs' fellow scientists, Englert and Brout, with King Baudouin (The God Of Small Things, November 17), but who was the woman? Part of the invisible field, perhaps. John Bailey St Albans, Herts Simon Weston's Photofit doesn't look like anyone he knows (Fit For Purpose, November 17). Did he miss Jim McDonald on Coronation Street? Ian Williams Mold, Flintshire I very much enjoyed Jane Thomson's response to the modern-day fairy stories (Letters, November 17). Like Princess Jane, I am a princess who has been similarly bewitched; my tale includes an arm that \"doesn't-do-as-it's-told\" thanks to a mischievous lymph Nymph. I think this calls for an up-to-date Princess Treasury. Princess Amazona from the Planet Zoladex Aka Karen Strang, Stirling So, Neil Gallagher is a die-hard Quo fan, is he (Letters, November 17)? Could this be a thinly disguised pseudonym? Stefan Goose Leeds Since 1968 Hunter Davies has been troubled by John Lennon's postcard comment: \"its gear wack\" (Confessions Of A Collector, November 17). The meaning's in the missing punctuation: \"it's gear, wack\" as in \"it's great, mate\". As the opening - Dear Hunters' - suggests, John's punctuation was hit and miss but, as Davies would know, he used \"gear\" regularly - in both senses of the word. Phil Scraton Belfast The \"funny-looking Indian general\" on Lennon's postcard is Subhas Chandra Bose. Not a real general, he was leader of the Indian National Army, the turncoat outfit that fought for the Japanese in Burma. He is revered as a hero of the Indian independence movement - far more than Gandhi - and there are statues of him all over the place, so his name is not on the card because it would be superfluous. In fact, he was merely a dupe, and Japanese victory would not have favoured the cause. But I imagine Lennon liked the Sgt Pepper uniform and those Lennonish granny glasses. Hugo Barnacle London NW5 Children's guitar (Gift Guide, November 17)? Big mistake - they'll just muck around with it, get frustrated and chuck it into the pile of toys. Better for any child aged seven and over is a ukulele. Only four strings for their little fingers, and with help from YouTube they'll be strumming the magic three chords in 10 minutes. Danny Staples London SE21 Guardian Weekend obviously thinks that within its readership are people who will spend \u00a345 on a stocking filler. Are these the same readers at whom Brainteaser is aimed? Pat Riley Chard, Somerset It took me some time to get Josh Hartnett's joke (Q&amp;A, November 10). Imagine my disappointment when (a perhaps too pedantic) friend pointed out that the flies would have been unable to screw \"in\" a lightbulb - they would have imploded due to the vacuum inside it.
