Self-discipline and focus might be exactly what someone needs while they're working from their bedroom, but that has nothing to do with the sort of people management skills a more substantial concern is going to need. In short, you need training, whether on leadership or on some other specific skill you feel you require. And this is where it gets difficult. For every excellent trainer who knows precisely what he or she is doing, there are several who are pretty hopeless. And although there is no barrier to prevent time-wasters setting up in business, there are questions you can ask to help determine whether a training organisation is the real deal (see below). Initially, however, the onus is on the potential trainee. Essentially you need to identify why you need training and what your objectives will be. David Harman, a trainer with LDL, has put together bespoke courses for business leaders and agrees that a lot of entrepreneurs will start off with mostly instinctive skills. \"One big challenge as they grow a business is how much they hang on to it and stay hands-on and how much they hand on to others,\" he says. \"In terms of skills they need, often one fundamental thing is the ability to let go, and another is to share their vision of where the business is heading. \"What you get with a lot of entrepreneurs is this amazing passion - they know what they want to achieve. They then bring in executive directors sometimes to challenge their preconceptions.\" Any training or mentoring Harman offers starts with the client's objectives. \"It may be they want to increase turnover, profitability of market share, or they may want to increase the motivation of people around them,\" he says. Sometimes people want a 360-degree evaluation of themselves and sometimes they simply want to feel supported in what can be a lonely role at the top of a company. Personal development Trainer Rachael Garside, director of Tall Spaghetti Ltd, chooses to base her business around personal development. \"Personal development makes all the difference to outcomes,\" she says. \"We have all encountered people who are highly qualified and have strong vocational skills, but are ineffective in their role for reasons such as poor people skills, lack of self-esteem or a negative attitude. Personal development allows you to address these areas and many more.\" The difficulty can often be that personal development inevitably involves taking some sort of criticism on board, and not everyone can handle that. Harman agrees that this can be the case and adds that when someone opts for a company like his to perform a full 360-degree evaluation as a starting point, they need to be ready for anything they might hear. \"Basically they're asking, 'what do people think of me as a leader?' They have to make sure they know why they're asking and what they're going to do with the information.\" If an evaluation concludes that someone isn't a very good leader, for example, but they choose to ignore it, the result is likely to be a highly unmotivated workforce. When it works, however, the results can be spectacular. Victor Tettmar is now managing partner with law firm Bond Pearce, which he joined as a trainee lawyer. The firm brought in Kaisen Consulting when it identified a gap four years ago. \"We started to look at succession planning,\" he says. \"Essentially we needed to think about who was going to be looking after the firm in a few years' time.\" Kaisen began by using psychometric testing to identify where in the organisation the next likely leaders would come from. The next task was to find out which essential skills potential new leaders already possessed and which needed to be identified as areas for training. Meanwhile, Tettmar and some colleagues were attending a course at Harvard Business School to acquire business rather than purely legal skills. Tettmar explains that one of the major gaps Kaisen identified in his case was people management. \"My training was as a lawyer. People management isn't something you naturally learn,\" he says. \"[I needed to learn] how to motivate my colleagues, how to get the best out of them.\" Kaisen soon put that right - and taking this approach with the whole company offered a threefold benefit: pointing Tettmar towards what was to become an entirely new career as a manager, putting succession management in place and revitalising the structure of the business so it could see where it would be in five years' time. The cost of these services varies dramatically, of course. Harman offers a one-to-one intensive day for several hundred pounds, or a much more intensive approach that begins with a full evaluation of a business and moves on from there for several thousands. \"The question is how much they want to invest and what they can save by doing it,\" says Harman. It can be more like a non-executive director role and can really push up profitability.\" Top tips - What to look out for in a trainer Kim Parish, chief executive of the Institute of Leadership and Management, identifies 10 things to look out for in a good management trainer: 1. Quality Be sure that the training company is approved by an awarding body such as the Institute of Leadership and Management 2. Business focus Can the trainer demonstrate how they would deliver improvements in individual and business performance? Look for evidence of a training team who have recent industry experience and can \"talk the language of business\" 3. Flexible learning design Have it your way. There are many different ways to deliver training. Bite-size learning and learning based on real business problems are both good methods 4. Experienced and competent Are they able to demonstrate familiarity with Management and Leadership Standards and trends in management development? Can they talk fluently about some of the drivers for change in management and leadership behaviour? 5. Credible Does the trainer listen to you and inspire confidence that they can deliver? 6. Cost effective Look at courses that provide creative ways of doing what you want: ways of spreading the cost, using computer-based learning to reduce time out of work etc 7. Challenging Does the trainer really make you work hard to nail down your objectives? And do they sometimes admit that training won't solve all your problems? The great ones will give you free management consultancy as well as training 8. Client references Make sure references are recent, specific and from your sector 9. Qualifications Is the trainer able to offer qualifications, so you and your colleagues gain external recognition for the course? 10. Resources Make sure the trainer has adequate staff, systems support, learning material, access to quality speakers etc"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
