This admission could uncover a rich seam of new material about middle age for the 50-year-old comic, known for his rambling style. However, it seems to serve only as carte blanche to punch down further and further, during an erratic, often excruciating hour. Hunter\u2019s show revolves around the tired idea that \u201ceverything is offensive\u201d nowadays, with the occasional joke centred on his family, his genitals or his troubles holding down a relationship to punctuate some fairly uncharitable observations. This is the Ricky Gervais model, only less funny, as proved when he wheels out a thoroughly played out \u201cWell, I could have identified as a submarine\u201d joke when talking about a seven-year-old\u2019s gender identity. At a time when both UK and US politics are in such intense flux \u2013 and his home state of Georgia faces widespread criticism for its restrictive new abortion law \u2013 Hunter delivers a routine that situates him as a victim of female hysteria. He gets his girlfriends at the \u201ccrazy bitch store\u201d and tells the audience that \u201cyou don\u2019t just want a woman who can fuck \u2026 she needs other skills, like being able to type\u201d. He is blase towards the #MeToo movement, citing the example of three women who he said made false accusations of inappropriate conduct against him \u2013 one of whom he was previously in a relationship with \u2013 and focusing on the potential for such allegations to \u201cend careers\u201d. Elsewhere, meatier topics such as mental health, grief, and reconnecting with his teenage offspring are glossed over in favour of forced \u201cedge\u201d. By the time he\u2019s gleefully segueing from Michael Jackson to Brokeback Mountain \u2013 seemingly conflating, or at least linking, the feelings of the singer\u2019s accusers with a film about a consensual same-sex relationship \u2013 it\u2019s clear that Hunter isn\u2019t genuinely feeling flummoxed by the current moment, but, ironically, revels in taking umbrage. \u201cComedy has got boring and safe,\u201d he proclaims, briefly dipping a toe into the Danny Baker debacle. But, really, it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s the one lagging behind. At Nottingham Playhouse, 22 May. Then touring until 29 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
