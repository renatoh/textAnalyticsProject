An inquiry by the conciliation service Acas into the wildcat strikes that followed British workers losing out to European nationals at an oil refinery at Lindsey, North Lincolnshire, has cleared the firms involved of breaking any laws. They are Total, the French oil giant which runs the refinery, US engineering contractor Jacobs Engineering, and Irem, the Italian subcontractor at the centre of the dispute. Irem was one of seven companies bidding for the work, five of which were based in Britain. The report reveals how unions complained that Irem's proposed shift pattern for the contract did not include paid tea breaks, even though all the British firms bidding for the work were required to include them in the contract. The report found: \"The time of a tea break may seem small but when multiplied by several hundred workers over the period of a contract for several months it can mount up to a considerable saving of time and, therefore, money ... Given that the contract was being awarded on a lump-sum basis of a fixed number of hours in which to complete the job, the above was felt by the unions to give Irem an unfair competitive advantage.\" Irem's management said it had offered a longer lunch break instead of the tea break, a move permitted under the terms and conditions set down in a national agreement for the engineering construction industry. Irem's workers were also required to change into work clothing during their own time, another money-saver. The dispute led to walk-outs from the nuclear site at Sellafield to refineries across England and Scotland. Acas's findings led today to Lord Mandelson, the business secretary, announcing an inquiry into productivity, to the anger of unions. The inquiry will be led by Mark Gibson, who is leaving a senior post within Mandelson's department this month. Mandelson said: \"Acas confirms that neither UK nor European law was broken at Lindsey and that European workers were covered by the industry's collective agreement, including the going rates of pay. Such an approach across the industry should avoid disputes in the future ... but my central concern is that British workers should have the skills and productivity to do jobs both at home and across Europe.\" Unions yesterday expressed \"extreme concern\" about the lack of wage transparency and the employment status of the Irem workers. Paul Kenny, the GMB general secretary, said: \"As things now stand, the UK business department, EU commission and European court of justice are a powerful and malevolent political machine, working with employers to cut terms and conditions of the UK construction engineering workforce. They are now meeting serious resistence.\" Unite's joint general secretary, Derek Simpson, said: \"The law wasn't broken - the law was wrong. Unless European governments start to put working people first with protective legislation that applies across the whole of the EU, then protests like the ones we have seen in the construction industry will go on until they do.\" Brendan Barber, the general secretary of the TUC, said: \"It is hardly surprising that the Acas inquiry has found that no laws have been broken, as the major union complaint is that the law does not properly protect UK-based workers \u2013 wherever they were born.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
