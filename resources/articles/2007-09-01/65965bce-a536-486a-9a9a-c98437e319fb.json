Families described how they woke to see trees being uprooted and roof tiles and chimney pots flying through the air as winds of 70mph hit the region. Up to 10 separate tornadoes were reported in towns from Hampshire to Cambridgeshire as a cold front moved north-east across England. Frank Mikos told how he woke in Farnborough, Hampshire, to find his home \"rocking from side to side\". He said: \"The entire flat just felt as if it was about to take off - just like in that scene in the Wizard of Oz. The noise was absolutely tremendous. I thought that the windows were about to come crashing in.\" Emergency services said 10 of the 20 homes affected in Mr Mikos's street had suffered serious structural damage. Mr Mikos added: \"The devastation is unbelievable. Slates, bus shelters, all just blown everywhere.\" Several garages in the area also had their roofs torn off, with debris crashing on to the cars inside. Terry Parrott described how he saw the tornado approaching as he was getting ready for work. \"I looked out of my bedroom window and could see this huge whirling thing come through between the two houses and it lifted the garage roofs up,\" he said. \"It just picked everything up, even stuff that was nailed down. It was incredible, and then after 90 seconds it was all gone, it was all over.\" Tony Bing, who also lives in Farnborough, said he heard a loud bang, adding that a bus shelter had been destroyed and a caravan overturned by the wind. Martin Bradshaw, 18, told how he watched as his back garden was \"obliterated\" by the force of the wind. \"I was just getting ready for work when it suddenly went dark outside and started lashing down with rain. Then the wind ripped a big tree out of the ground and threw it across the garden, in front of my eyes. Our garden is completely obliterated - furniture everywhere and the fencing is completely destroyed.\" Ruth Spaull of Limbury, Luton described how she looked out of her window to see a tornado bearing down on her home. Fences came down and roof tiles clattered into gardens below after a tornado struck around 7.30am. Ms Spaull, 38, said that on hearing the wind she ran to window. \"That's when I saw it and couldn't believe my eyes. It was a tornado. It came round a tree and it must have been around four metres across. It was full of leaves and branches and seemed to be grey in colour,\" she said. \"It reached my back garden and then I saw my daughter's trampoline lifted into the air. It flipped over into the garden next door, smashed through a fence panel and ended up in the road. We are talking about a trampoline, 10ft wide and really heavy, but it was just lifted like a feather.\" In Nuneaton, Warwickshire, residents said a tornado hit at around 6.20am. Marilyn Davis said: \"It was terrifying. There was a great big gust of wind and the next thing I knew the roof was being blown off. We have got no roof so we are completely exposed to the elements - I can see the sky from my landing.\" Residents said several homes on Haunchwood Farm estate in the town had been seriously damaged. Shopkeeper John Maydwell, who runs the local supermarket, said he heard a series of loud bangs like bombs exploding. \"The wind literally whooshed past the front of the shop and it hit all the houses in the street,\" he said. \"There's a row of about 10 or 15 homes and most have had their roofs ripped off. To make matters worse, the tiles have gone through all the car windows. It's absolute bedlam.\" In Eye, Cambridgeshire, police said a motorist reported seeing a car blown across a road by a tornado. In Northampton another tornado hit just before 7am, uprooting several trees, one of which hit an empty school bus. Last night Terrence Meaden, deputy head of Torro, a group which researches tornadoes, said four reports were \"looking certain\" to be confirmed as tornadoes. They came from Farnborough, Luton, Nuneaton, and Eye. Dr Meaden said further research may confirm that tornadoes hit in Northampton; Nottingham; Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire; Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire; Long Eaton, Derbyshire; and Ollerton, Nottinghamshire."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
