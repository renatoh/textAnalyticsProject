He was 86. A pioneer in his field, Post\u2019s assessments of leaders such as Saddam Hussein, Muammar Gaddafi and Kim Jong-il helped guide presidents and other US officials. He brought his work closer to home in his final years, assessing Trump\u2019s rise to power and his relationship with his followers, thoughts he published in book form in late 2019. In an interview at the time, Post accurately predicted the aftermath of Trump\u2019s election defeat. \u201cI think we can be assured that he will not concede early,\u201d Post told Salon. \u201cTrump may not even recognize the legitimacy of the election.\u201d Post died on 22 November, after a storied career which included founding the CIA Center for the Analysis of Personality and Political Behavior. In 2002, a year after the 9/11 attacks but a year before the US invasion of Iraq, Post told the Guardian that Osama bin Laden had a \u201cmalignantly narcissistic personality\u201d and Saddam Hussein had a \u201cwounded self\u201d, from a traumatic upbringing. \u201cTypically, after such traumatic experiences, people can sink into despair and hopelessness,\u201d Post said. \u201cBut it can also produce compensatory dreams of glory.\u201d Post\u2019s \u201cgreatest coup\u201d, the Guardian said then, came in 1979, when he \u201ctipped off the Carter administration that Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat\u2019s deeply contrasting personalities left an opening for an intermediary \u2013 an observation that helped pave the way to Camp David\u201d and peace between Israel and Egypt. In addition to his work for the US government, Post wrote 14 books. His last work was Dangerous Charisma: The Political Psychology of Donald Trump and His Followers, co-authored with Stephanie Doucette. The book, and Post\u2019s preceding assessments about Trump\u2019s personality, drew criticism for violating the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Goldwater rule, which prohibits psychiatrists assessing public figures without examination and consent. \u201cThe Goldwater rule is really a masterpiece in contradictions,\u201d Post said at an APA meeting in 2017. Between writing and working for the CIA, Post also saw patients. His family told the Washington Post his professional success \u201cwas a reflection of an insatiable, roving curiosity and a probing empathy for his fellow humans \u2013 qualities that also made him a highly engaging friend and a nurturing husband, father and doctor\u201d. His daughter, Cindy Post, told the newspaper: \u201cHe always wanted to know, what are the people about and what is their world?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
