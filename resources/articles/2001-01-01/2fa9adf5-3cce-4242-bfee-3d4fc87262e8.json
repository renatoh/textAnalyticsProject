Jim Smith, with eight of his regulars ill, suspended or on international call, cobbled together a side featuring one or two untried players and they did him proud. Although Rovers made all the running and their keeper Brad Friedel scarcely laid a hand on the ball, it was County who caught the eye with resolved defence and non-stop commitment. Smith managed Rovers for a spell in the Seventies and, although not given to hyperbole, was delighted: 'We're happy with that. We played well defensively particularly since six of the boys were up all night with sickness and diarrhoea. And that was Carbonari's best game ever for us'. The Argentine was outstanding, making a succession of saving tackles and distributing raking, 50-yard passes to front runners Malcolm Christie and Rory Delap. Carbonari's example fired up his younger team-mates to sustain a non-stop intensity. And for all Rovers' superiority on the ball, Derby's team work merited the draw. Graeme Souness, Blackburn's pragmatic boss, knew it had been a missed opportunity. 'If you don't score at home in a cup tie it is a failure but I've got no complaints about our performance. We'll go to Pride Park and be positive and try to win. It should be a good game.' But the manager whose team are on a winning run in the Nationwide knows that Rovers' inability to beat a side like Derby at Ewood Park may be a significant pointer to life in the Premiership should they make it. Ironically, of course, it could be Derby who make way for them. For the record, Matt Jansen missed the best of several chances when he headed across goal rather than into it as he stood unmarked five yards out on the end of Duff's accurate centre. Craig Short, restored to the side after an eight week lay-off, went up against his old team for a free kick and just failed to get enough head on the ball from close range. Marc Keller hit a fierce shot on the turn, which Poom did well to palm away diving to his right. And an audacious lob from 35 yards by David Dunn was on target but not good enough to deceive the Derby keeper. There was loud clamour for a penalty when Alan Mahon went tumbling in the Derby area but Mr Pearson would have none of it and subsequent replays proved him right. So this tie must go back to Derby where presumably the home side will be in more attacking mode. But by then they may have the squad available to play that way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
