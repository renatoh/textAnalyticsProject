Angered about Sven Goran Eriksson's claims that \"someone could be killed\" if England fans ignored the pleas to stay at home, the head of the Turkish Football Federation Haluk Ulusoy hit back by saying: \"I think Mr Eriksson must have forgotten what happened in the Heysel disaster.\" Ulusoy declared that Eriksson had alternative reasons for not wanting England fans to travel. \"Of course he does not want to see England supporters in Turkey when all there is to see is a defeat.\" He then went on to declare Turkey would beat England so heavily that Eriksson would be sacked. \"He will be sent away from the England job because he will have no credibility left and will be fit only to train Patagonia.\" The FA will be appalled, to say the least, by the inflammatory nature of the comments, and Ulusoy is becoming an |increasingly irritating presence to senior figures at Soho Square. At the weekend quotes were attributed to him saying that he was happy to sell tickets to England fans, something he subsequently denied."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
