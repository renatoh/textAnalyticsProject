But it seems that certain parts of Britain's inner cities have become no-go areas for the company's delivery drivers. The German-owned company has revealed that some neighbourhoods of big cities, including London, Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow, have been blacklisted because of the risk of couriers being attacked. Residents in the Canning Town and Custom House areas of London, for example, were told recently they would have to pick up their packages from a depot amid fears for the safety of DHL staff. A DHL spokesman, Matthew Zamoyski, said: \"Mostly, it has been a case of threatening behaviour, or people surrounding the vehicle and making life difficult.\" He said decisions not to deliver to some areas were taken by local managers, but insisted there was no \"blanket list\" of problem areas. \"Where there is an area we have had problems with, the local manager would make a decision that they won't deliver for a while until it has settled down,\" he said. \"It's a case of the manager talking to his driver and saying, 'How do you feel about this?' He might say, 'It's getting a bit hairy out there,' and a decision might be made that it's not safe.\" There are thought to be about two dozen postal areas in Britain on the company's blacklist at any time, but DHL refused to say where they were. Many are thought to be council estates and tower blocks in inner-city areas. The list is not permanent, and areas can be taken off the list if the situation improves. Mr Zamoyski said he was not aware of any surge in attacks. DHL was one of the first companies to open in Baghdad after the fall of Saddam Hussein, and also operates in Afghanistan and North Korea. The company opened in Baghdad only days after the Iraq war ended. One of its transport planes was hit by a shoulder-launched rocket as it left Baghdad airport in November 2003, but managed to land safely. The spokesman said DHL was able to deliver there because of local arrangements. He said: \"[Iraq and Britain] are very different cases. There are local security arrangements applicable in every country, and they differ.\" DHL employs more than 170,000 people across the world and can deliver to 220 countries and territories. The company, which began couriering in 1969, takes its name from the initials of the three men who founded it, Adrian Dalsey, Larry Hillblom and Robert Lynn. DHL started by shipping papers by plane from San Francisco to Honolulu, but soon expanded across the rest of the world."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
