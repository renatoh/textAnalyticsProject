Here is this guy, swimming about in a big goldfish bowl for a week in New York. (Was his memory reduced to seven seconds? He must have thought he'd been in there for ever.) The locals are whooping and high-fiving him through the glass, while celebrities drop by to say how totally cool and awesome he is. It takes me back to when he was in that box in London. We threw eggs at him, flashed and mooned, zapped him with lasers and buzzed him with hamburgers dangling from model helicopters. Even Paul McCartney came along to have a pop at him. Who says we're not great any more? This show is really about Blaine's attempt on the how-long-can-you-hold-your-breath record, which he did at the end of his goldfish-bowl stint. Surely this is the stupidest thing he's done so far. What's next? How long can he go without blinking? Standing on one leg? The holding-your-breath record stands at eight minutes, 59 seconds, which you have to admit is pretty impressive. Blaine fails miserably to beat it, and has to be rescued after just seven minutes, eight seconds, and carted off to hospital in the back of an ambulance. Clearly, seven minutes, eight seconds of breath-holding doesn't fill an hour of TV, so some padding is required. We get a lot of Blaine walking around underwater, among startled-looking conger eels and rays. We see him training. And we get a few choice Blaine-isms. \"I don't think anything forward or back means anything,\" he says. \"Right now is all you have.\" (See, he has turned into a goldfish.) And: \"Pain is nothing but a cancer. Cut it out of your mind, there is no pain, there's just you.\" (Good news for all cancer sufferers - stop moaning, it's all in the mind.) Still on the subject of incurable diseases, Blaine visits Evel Knievel, who is dying of a lung condition called Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. So what does Blaine do in front of him? Only goes and holds his breath for five minutes, his body shaking and turning blue as it runs out of oxygen. Now that's not very sensitive, David, in front of a man whose body is actually undergoing exactly that, but over a longer period of time. I guess you probably think it's all in his mind. (By this stage I've started to moon and hurl eggs at my own television set.) There's still some time to fill, so Blaine does a bit of street magic. He eats a wine glass, makes a woman's teeth disappear, gets people's phones to text the card they just picked, ties his own shoelaces just by shaking his foot around. And guess what? It's absolutely wonderful. This is what he used to do - stop people in the street, stun them with magic. Please go back to small, David, it's so much more beautiful than your silly big stunts, and you're better at it. You might even get away with street magic in London. Ah, Summer of ... Love, 1967 (BBC2, Saturday) - a bunch of boring old hippies telling us how cool they used to be, how much pot they smoked and sex they had. Is there anything more tedious? I'd much rather listen to proper old people talking about the time before, when the world was in black and white and you were allowed only one egg a week (that's when David Blaine should have visited). And what about the stuff they smoked back then? Kids these days would probably stab anyone who sold them that. It's like saying you used to go out and get totally pissed on half a pint of shandy. You and your silly daisy chains (they've changed, too, by the way - you don't put them in your hair any more, you have them with your mates, after school ... I think). And your silly songs: We skipped the light fandango Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor It's all nonsense, and so are you. Be quiet. World Cup Stories (BBC2, Sunday) are portraits of one country's football set in context of everything that's going on there. And they have been brilliant. This one is on Argentina so it's obviously quite painful viewing to anyone English. It's about brutal thuggery, cheating, very very bad hair and ... oh, alright then, some pretty special football too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
