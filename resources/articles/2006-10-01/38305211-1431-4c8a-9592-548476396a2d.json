The circular says because \"all pupils in KS1-4 should benefit from personalised learn ing\", it will be spread around all types of institutions, except nurseries and sixth forms, \"because they already offer a highly personalised service\". Finally, it states that more funding will be targeted at secondary schools because \"of evidence of a decrease in the number of pupils fully engaged in their learning during KS3, resulting in fewer pupils meeting national expectations than in Sats at KS1 and KS2\". So, personalised learning, in government terms, is about targeting resources to achieve Sats targets, using funding previously earmarked under other head ings. But hidden away is the real message: the basis of personalised learning is smaller class sizes. Why didn't they say that in the first place? Bill Anderson Birmingham Mish-mash in the market-state At the time of their launch in 1986, city technology colleges (What goes around ..., October 3) represented an appropriation by education from the department of employment of a way to run all schools independently of LEAs, Pupils at Kingshurst, the first city technology college in the country borrowed from the way the Manpower Services Commission ran Youth Training Schemes. CTCs and city academies also illustrate the contracted funding from the centre that replaced the former national system locally administered. A state-subsidised private sector is mingled indiscriminately with a semi privatised state sector. Francis Beckett's book promises plenty of juicy detail on the corruption endemic to this new mixed economy in the new market-state. Patrick Ainley School of Education and Training, University of Greenwich Don't try to make employers pay It is encouraging to read the eminently sensible suggestions made in the report from the National Institute for Adult Continuing Education about English for speakers of other languages (Esol) provision (Comment, Further, October 3). Peter Lavender suggests that free learning for everyone without level 2 qualifications cannot be sustained in the long-term. Perhaps this is because the DfES set the target for Skills for Life as anyone without an A*-C in English and maths - some 82% of all adults, most of whom do not have real basic skills dif ficulties - a ridiculous aim for what is supposed to be a literacy and num eracy improvement strategy. There is now an awkward bind facing policy-makers. To give free provision to four in five adults for a few years, then withdraw it for those who have not yet taken it up, might be difficult to justify. Where I part company with Lavender is on the suggestion that employers should pay the costs of their staff acquiring level 1 skills. Many speakers of other languages work for small employers. Trying to get them to pay will only discriminate against those seeking to learn. Helping adults acquire basic language skills is the responsibility of the state. Only with sustained state funding will learning opportunities match the demand for learning. Alan Wells, former director, Basic Skills Agency London E11 Bonjour, hola, guten Tag May I correct the statement (Taking French leave, October 3) that the end of French at Keele would leave no language degrees in Staffordshire and Cheshire? There is a thriving, long-established and well-resourced languages department, offering degrees in French, German and Spanish, at the University of Chester.
