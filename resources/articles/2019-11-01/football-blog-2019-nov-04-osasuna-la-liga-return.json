They did not have much money \u2013 only three teams have a smaller budget \u2013 and they did not have success to sell, either: the second division title is the only thing they have won and they had just done that for the first time in 58 years. But they could offer something different. When the tapes went out, sales pitches carefully edited in-house, they were not filled with 101 great goals, superb saves or glorious games. Instead they were packed with people. The footage was not of footballers; it was of fans. It was who they are. Osasuna sold El Sadar \u2013 the place that can feel like the one, last old ground left even though, opened in 1967, it is not that old. It is a ground where the main stand is so steep, so tight that you feel as if you will tumble on to the pitch below. Punk is played at half-time and fans reach out and touch you, legs dangling over the barriers, banging the drum, flags waving, noise never letting up, team never letting up either. It is the kind of place you would want to play \u2013 if, that is, you are the kind of player they would want playing for them. And Ezequiel \u201cChimy\u201d \u00c1vila was exactly the kind of player they wanted playing for them: the striker with big thighs and an even bigger heart whom the sporting director, Braulio V\u00e1zquez, introduced as \u201cborn to play for Osasuna\u201d. First, though, he had to convince Chimy of that. Chimy was not the only footballer sent footage \u2013 Pervis Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n and Facundo Roncaglia were also among the seven players signed \u2013 but he is the new signing who best represents Osasuna\u2019s plans, the identity they were celebrating and reinforcing. \u201cOur fans are our greatest asset. We don\u2019t have much money or the talent other teams have but we have them. You have to make players see it\u2019s a special place,\u201d Braulio says. \u201cWe wanted them to know where they were coming. Here in Pamplona players are God. We sent videos of the fans, how they\u2019re on top of everyone, how they react, how they celebrate. And they really liked them. \u201cWe had to conquer his heart; there\u2019s an emotional element to it. I said to Chimy: \u2018Imagine the whole of El Sadar chanting: Chimy! Chimy!\u2019 He laughed at that: \u2018I can see it already!\u2019 He had other offers but this was the place for him. I told him maybe at Betis, say, the fans like a nutmeg more but here, if you sprint back 50 metres, kill yourself to defend, you\u2019re an idol. At some clubs you might get whistled but, when he missed a sitter against Villarreal, they were all: \u2018Chimy! Chimy!\u2019 And then he scores a brilliant goal.\u201d By then Chimy knew. At his presentation he already knew. The tapes did the trick. \u201cThis is a club where I feel people will love me,\u201d he said back then and he was right. Now an idol in the city and in a team that have played even better than anyone imagined, he says: \u201cWhen Braulio sent me the video of them celebrating promotion, it was emotional seeing the fans. That really got me. And being able to experience it for myself is lovely. That\u2019s why I took the decision to come and I\u2019m happy I did.\u201d At his presentation Chimy promised: \u201cTheir style\u2019s mine: run, crash into people, never give up,\u201d and that starts in the stands. There is a reason that Osasuna won 17 home games in a row on their way to the second division title last year and did not lose at El Sadar all season. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s an exaggeration to say there were eight games we won because of the fans,\u201d says the striker Brandon Thomas. \u201cThat\u2019s what this club is.\u201d As the captain, Roberto Torres, told El Pa\u00eds: \u201cIn that sense I think Osasuna genuinely is a bit different. Here, unlike other places, fans support Osasuna, not Madrid or Barcelona. Tradition has been lost a bit, the essence of football. Few care about the fans, when they are what really matters. El Sadar\u2019s always been a slightly more \u2018English\u2019 ground. They used to say big teams feared coming.\u201d Now they do again. Barcelona drew 2-2 there and Valencia were hammered 3- 1, but this is more than just a couple of games and more than fans making a lot of noise or a team being good at home. It is that \u2013 as the manager, Jagoba Arrasate, put it on Sunday night after their 4-2 victory against Alav\u00e9s \u2013 they are \u201cbinomial\u201d. Fans and footballers go \u201chand in hand\u201d. Game and ground are inseparable. This team belong in this place; it is this place. Arrasate understands that best. The idea was there but he is the one who fully re\u2011established that relationship when he took over before last season . . . play constructed around the people, their personality. \u201cFrom the start he wanted to recover that traditional identity, to go for it,\u201d says the winger Rub\u00e9n Garc\u00cca, superb last season and this campaign. \u201cHe told everyone there has to be a communion. With every run, every tackle, the fans lift you; they are the adrenaline you need.\u201d Osasuna play as if someone has cut their brake cables and it is much better that way. At home, at least, they go, go, go and then, when they have their breath back or even if they have not, they go again. They isolate opponents and chase them down, terrified. When they get the ball, it is much the same. It is relentless; every pass played with intent, going for the throat, every move played as if it was the last, time running out. On Sunday night a wild game finished 4-2 and the fact there were three penalties and endless stoppages for VAR \u2013 El Sadar is one of the few places to make them fun, drum rolls building to the decision \u2013 took nothing from a match one paper called \u201cblessed madness\u201d. Rub\u00e9n Garc\u00eda scored the first, Chimy swept in an exceptional second, first time on the bounce, and V\u00edctor Laguardia got one back for Alav\u00e9s a minute later with a finish almost as good: another half-volley, hit superbly. Torres made it 3-1 six minutes into additional time at the end of the first half and Lucas P\u00e9rez brought it back to 3-2 with another penalty, before a third from Juan Villar made it 4-2. They had been playing 55 minutes and there had been six goals but, though there were no more, it was not over. In fact, it was getting better. The afternoon had started with Garc\u00eda forcing a save from Fernando Pacheco after 20 seconds and ended with Inigo P\u00e9rez smashing off the post in added time, just as Nacho Vidal had hammered off the bar. In the meantime Alav\u00e9s had 12 shots and Osasuna racked up 19 to go with the 30 against Valencia. \u201cOur games are anything but dull,\u201d Braulio says. \u201cYou\u2019re winning 4-2 but at the end, you\u2019ve got one full-back crossing for the other.\u201d Osasuna are, he says, like Liverpool; Arrasate is the Spanish J\u00fcrgen Klopp. \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference, eh,\u201d he adds swiftly, laughing, but there is something in it. \u201cPeople have fun watching us. It\u2019s the rhythm, the speed, the intensity. We\u2019re very vertical. It\u2019s all very back and forth. But it\u2019s not just that we run and put a foot in. We play, too. Rub\u00e9n Garc\u00eda, Roberto Torres, Chimy, Fran M\u00e9rida: they can all play. The full-backs are like airplanes.\u201d The fans, meanwhile, are like players. \u201cThis is a team that\u2019s brave, that takes the initiative but, bloody hell, behind it are the fans,\u201d Arrasate says. \u201cThey make you feel almost invincible.\u201d They almost are. There is a slight cheat, an asterisk \u2013 among their victories is last season\u2019s forfeited match against Reus \u2013 but Arrasate has never been beaten at home as Osasuna manager and this was their 31st game in a row without defeat there: four in 2017-18, 21 last season, and six this. Eibar, Barcelona, Betis, Villarreal, Valencia and Alav\u00e9s have all been now; none won. The run goes back 582 days, to April 2018, and it brought Osasuna up, put them three points off a Champions League place and secured 18 primera points, almost halfway to survival already: 31 is a record, beating the previous best set 61 years ago. The following morning at Tajonar, the club\u2019s training ground, a man set off rockets. \u201cHistoric,\u201d cheered the cover of El Diario de Navarra. \u201cO\u00e9 o\u00e9 o\u00e9 o\u00e9 o\u00e9 o\u00e9,\u201d ran the headline inside. El Sadar had become a \u201cplace of legend\u201d, it said. At the end that place rose to applaud, their work here almost done. Players stood and applauded the supporters back. \u201cIn this record the players will appear but so will they because, without the fans, it would be impossible,\u201d Arrasate said and it was no empty platitude. It was their third game in a week and fatigue had crept in but they had emerged from those with seven points, two more wins at home and nine goals. \u201cThe manager said to us before the game: \u2018Today being tired is no excuse.\u2019 As soon as the fans raise their voice you feel yourself lift; the tiredness goes,\u201d Garc\u00eda said afterwards. Outside some kids waited for a photo. \u201cThe record is down to them, too,\u201d Garc\u00eda said before heading out to join them, pulling the same silly faces as they did. \u201cThis should be the essence of football, something that could be recovered at 99.9% of clubs. And, if we\u2019re an example here at Osasuna, it\u2019s a good one. \u201cNow we\u2019ll always be able to say we\u2019re part of this club\u2019s history. We\u2019ve been talking about that in the dressing room, about how we\u2019re all part of this, the fans especially. When they get home, they\u2019ll talk about this too. In 20 years they\u2019ll be able to say: \u2018I was there the day of the record, I lived those 31 games.\u2019 It\u2019s not chance and that union means we enjoy it more. What we\u2019ve done together is great.\u201d It is \u2013 so good someone should make a video of it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
