You don\u2019t get a choice. It\u2019s kind of a privilege to want to be involved in politics. Someone who is Indigenous has for so long kind of been, I guess, controlled by it.\u201d Brown was one of four high school students on the Q&amp;A panel on Monday night. The Williamstown high student joined Parade College student Pinidu Chandrasekera, an aspiring journalist from Melbourne; Kaniva college student Jock Maddern, representing a small Victorian farming community of 1,000 people; and MacRobertson girls\u2019 high school student Jacinta Speer, an alumni of the Yale University Young Global Scholars program and past intern for Labor MPs Bill Shorten and Anna Burke. All four had won their place in a video audition against 250 other applicants, Jones said, to take part in the program\u2019s first high school special. All the audience members were high school students, many decked out in their uniforms at 9.35pm in order to appear on live television. Their questions ranged from the ability of old white guys Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn to secure the youth vote, to intergenerational poverty, the government\u2019s oft-criticised PaTH program, terrorism, the proposed Adani coalmine, suicide and equal rights. Also on the panel, though without the rigorous audition process, were the environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, and the shadow health minister, Catherine King. The often unfair linking of government, identity and politics was a common theme. In an echo of the vilification and eventual emigration of Yassmin Abdel-Magied, Sondus Sammak, a young Muslim woman in a white hijab, asked if she and other muslims would be more monitored and \u201cviewed through the prism of terrorism\u201d if they posted political opinions on social media. \u201cDo I have freedom of speech like anyone else?\u201d she asked. Frydenberg\u2019s assurance that social media and other activity would only be monitored with a warrant under the new super-ministry of home affairs, and comments about the Muslim community being a partner in national security, did not change the reality of life as a Muslim person in Australia, Sammak said. \u201cI feel like the government puts all of these measures to protects us but at the same time it is marginalising the Muslim community and we can feel that in everywhere that we go,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy do I on the street have to feel like I\u2019m a subject for Islamophobia, even though my government is telling me I\u2019m safe to go out? Just because I\u2019m wearing my headscarf, I can easily be targeted. \u201cI have the right to feel as safe as everyone else in this country, and I ... I don\u2019t feel as safe as everyone else in this country.\u201d Jasmine Kinderis, a student from regional Victoria, told the panel she was also made to feel unsafe because of a prejudice she felt was reinforced by government policy: the insistence that marriage equality could only be achieved through a plebiscite. It was not an abstract question, Kinderis said. Being \u201copenly abused for holding hands\u201d would increase, she suggested. The young panel was united in its support for marriage equality but divided in its approach: Chandrasekera and Maddern supported a plebiscite on marriage equality, while Speer and Stewart-Brown said it would be damaging to LGBTIQ people, particularly LGBTIQ young people. \u201cYou do everything as you can to be a good person, it shouldn\u2019t matter who you love,\u201d Maddern said, broadening from his small-government stance, which in previous responses had made him appear conservative enough to attract the attention of Cory Bernardi. \u201cNo one should be able to say you cannot marry [the person you love],\u201d he said. \u201cFor someone else to say that\u2019s not acceptable is criminally unfair, really.\u201d Stewart-Brown said she was \u201cleft kind of broken\u201d at the fact that she could not ever plan to get married in Australia, while her straight peers could. King agreed, and dismissed Frydenberg\u2019s comment that the Coalition would stand by its policy of only supporting marriage equality through a plebiscite, not a free vote in parliament. \u201cYou have changed policies all the time, I don\u2019t know why you won\u2019t change your policy on this,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should just get this done.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
