They're outright evil from this anti-comedian", "bodyText": "\u2018What disease did legendary ice-cream makers Ben &amp; Jerry give to all the prostitutes in their home town of Waterbury, Vermont?\u201d \u201cAt what point at a Julio Iglesias concert do most people throw up?\u201d Say what you like about anti-comedian Neil Hamburger, but his set-ups alone are works of art. Gregg Turkington has been playing the character for more than 25 years, ploughing a distinctive furrow of anti-comedy, where the jokes aren\u2019t just bad \u2013 by conventional standards \u2013 but often outright evil. This Soho theatre gig was the first time I\u2019d watched the act in a few years, certainly since we embarked on our new cultural moment of (supposedly) hair-trigger sensitivity to offence \u2013 in which atmosphere, you might think Turkington\u2019s shtick would curdle. It doesn\u2019t \u2013 for a variety of reasons. It\u2019s interesting watching the show within days of seeing Jimmy Carr and Ricky Gervais in action. Those latter acts are frequently unpleasant, while insisting they don\u2019t mean to be. By contrast Hamburger, who was created to be repugnant, is \u2013 on this form \u2013 almost lovable. Carr and Gervais style themselves as PC refuseniks, fearlessly telling all those jokes against lesbians, fat people and the trans community that the rest of us are too oppressed to tell. I don\u2019t know the first thing about Turkington\u2019s personality or politics, but that\u2019s clearly not what he\u2019s up to with Neil Hamburger. Whether or not it\u2019s a deliberate response to changing mores, who knows, but homophobia is absent from No One Loves a Hater. That\u2019s not always been the case with Hamburger, a tuxedo-clad old-school entertainer, hair greased across his pate, clutching his vodkas like a lifeline, whimpering in self-hate after every poison punchline. He bows to no one \u2013 not Frankie Boyle, not Jerry Sadowitz \u2013 in terms of the rococo horrors his imagination can conjure. Sexual deviance, diseases \u2013 it\u2019s all here, and revelled in. But as background, usually, not as the butt of the joke. That role falls to the more or less obscure celebrities that get Hamburger\u2019s goat. The character is a failure, a sad-sack; his life is pathetic. His act is about hating on people whose success rubs his nose in it \u2013 particularly, those whom a 1950s relic such as Hamburger might consider counter-cultural. The Grateful Dead, Johnny Depp, the lead singer of Blind Melon: \u201cperverts\u201d. Limp Bizkit: \u201cjerks\u201d. ET and Domino\u2019s Pizza: signs of the end times. A long central section breaks up the one-liner rhythm with a dark-fantasy tirade against Kiss frontman Gene Simmonds\u2019 new restaurant in Terminal 1 of LAX airport. So the joke\u2019s not on the abused minorities in Carr and Gervais\u2019s firing lines. It\u2019s on an arbitrary selection of B-list celebs. And \u2013 rebounding back off them \u2013 it\u2019s on Hamburger himself. As Sadowitz and, to a lesser extent, acts like Doug Stanhope demonstrate, hateful comedy flies when we can see what hate does to the hater. (We\u2019re laughing less at the ostensible butt of their jokes than at the loser, the broken man, who\u2019s telling them.) It\u2019s an uglier proposition when the comic is high status, when we\u2019re encouraged to see viciousness and meanness of spirit as cool attributes, as something to admire \u2013 as a ticket, indeed, to fame, fortune and adulation. That\u2019s not to say Hamburger\u2019s current show is an offence-free zone. Some may well find his zingers \u2013 glancing at rape, eating disorders, drug abuse and so on \u2013 hard to take. The brand of resentful inadequacy he\u2019s sending up feels pretty male \u2013 and he attracts a mainly male crowd, among them fans who bark and whine in sync with Hamburger, to show how much they get the joke. I\u2019d guess that behaviour is more likely to offend than anything Turkington says, in a show proving that \u2013 even in our brave new safe-space world \u2013 there\u2019s life in this loathsome character act yet. \u2022 Neil Hamburger: No One Loves a Hater is at Soho theatre, London, to 29 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
