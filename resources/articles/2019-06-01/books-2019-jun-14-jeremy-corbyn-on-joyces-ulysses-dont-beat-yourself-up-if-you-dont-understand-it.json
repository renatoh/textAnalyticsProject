In the US, former vice president Joe Biden has been joined by his fellow 2020 Democrat presidential hopefuls Pete Buttigieg and Beto O\u2019Rourke in praising the book. In the UK, Jeremy Corbyn revealed in a 2016 Mumsnet Q&amp;A that it has long been his favourite novel too. When I spoke to Corbyn in advance of this year\u2019s Bloomsday \u2013 16 June, the day in 1904 on which the events of Joyce\u2019s Dublin mock epic are set \u2013 he recalled first reading it in the early 80s while travelling round Europe and north Africa by train. \u201cA very great Irish friend of mine told me 15 years or so before the journey that I had to read Ulysses. It was the perfect company on the train journey, which was endless.\u201d He says, like many people, at first he found the book \u201cincomprehensible\u201d. But then \u201cyou stop trying to focus on the narrative and start just enjoying the vignettes\u201d. Back then he didn\u2019t tackle it from start to finish, and that is not the way he has read it since, instead regularly just dipping into passages. It is an approach he recommends to first time readers today: \u201cRead a little bit at a time and think about it and then move on, but don\u2019t beat yourself up if you don\u2019t understand it.\u201d As much as its literary achievements, Corbyn is attracted by the politics in the book, around its creation and its reception. As for its being banned for sexual content, he points out: \u201cI\u2019m sure the upper classes wrote in private to each other about these matters. You almost feel sorry for the censors who had to read and try and understand it, until they found something they deemed offensive.\u201d Ulysses is set during the year Joyce left Dublin, and Corbyn believes being away sharpened his vision: \u201cThe mirror of exile can be very powerful and very intense. When you\u2019re in exile you remember with almost photographic detail what you went through.\u201d In his political career he has had a long association with refugees around the world, as well as with the large Irish community in his Islington constituency. He remembers meeting older Irish men who had come over to London as builders. They talked in minute detail about the villages they were from and where they intended to return. \u201cAnd they never went back. They kept saying, \u2018When I go home\u2019,\u201d he recalls, \u201cboth of us knowing full well they\u2019re never going to go home.\u201d After he left Ireland, Joyce retained a keen interest in the politics of his homeland. Ulysses is set at a time when political tension was rising in Dublin. It was first published as a single volume in 1922, the year civil war broke out and not long after the Easter Rising of 1916. Joyce was an active socialist during the first decade of the 20th century. Corbyn notes that many of those who fought in the Easter Rising were first and foremost socialists rather than nationalists: \u201cJames Connolly represented that socialist tradition in Ireland.\u201d Corbyn\u2019s love of the novel is part of his broader interest in Irish literature and history. As far back as school he was influenced by Cecil Woodham-Smith\u2019s classic account of the famine, The Great Hunger. Later he read James Plunkett\u2019s Strumpet City, centred around the Dublin lock-out of 1913-14 and the horrifying poverty of the times. \u201cIreland has had a huge impact on British political life for a very long time,\u201d Corbyn reflects. He draws a line from the Irish uprisings in the 17th century to the defeat of Gladstone\u2019s second home rule bill in 1893, which set the scene for the uneasy stasis Joyce threaded into Ulysses. And then that line moves on from the civil war and through the strife of the 20th century to reach, finally, what he hails as \u201cthe great achievement of the peace process.\u201d After Ulysses, Corbyn says Chinua Achebe\u2019s Things Fall Apart is the book he returns to most. Ben Okri\u2019s The Famished Road is another favourite. But as Bloomsday approaches he urges more people to read the novel that, among many other things, captures a society going about its business in uneasy times. \u201cJoyce references and richly describes what\u2019s happening in the street,\u201d he says. \u201cSo somebody is holding forth about a big political issue and then the refuse cart goes by. Whenever there is a big political issue on, I walk around the streets in my area. We might be totally obsessed with Brexit or some other issue but many people are not. Their daily lives are more important. Politicians should never forget that people have lives to lead and they often have dreams they don\u2019t talk about.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
