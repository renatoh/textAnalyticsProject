Written and read by Daljit Nagra Faber 60min \u00a312.99 In startlingly newly minted language, with cracking vigour and wicked humour, this collection (which won the 2007 Forward Prize) explores the experience of a second-generation British Punjabi. The contradictory feelings of dislocation, assimilation and alienation in this 'flighty mix-up country' are emphasised by the shifts of language from Punjabi English - 'She effing at my mum / in all di colours of Punjabi' - to regional and formal English. Nagra's licence with language is invigorating - how could you better describe the first flush of married life than 'Darling is so pirouetty with us / for whirlwind married month'? The poet's reading, like his words, is energetic and as alive as quicksilver. Wahay Guru!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
