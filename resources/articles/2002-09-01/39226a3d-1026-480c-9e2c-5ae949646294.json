The Financial Services Authority, the regulator, would declare that the insurer had become insolvent. But this could be a protracted and messy process. 'It would depend what assumptions are used,' says solicitor Robin Ellison of Pinsent Curtis Biddle. 2. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) would take on the process of evaluating the remaining assets, sharing them out between policyholders, seeing if any other solution were possible and - as a last resort - paying compensation. The FSCS took on this role only last December and has not yet handled any collapses. And its predecessor, the Policyholders Protection Board, had no experience of dealing with a with-profits fund in a collapse. 'We haven't dealt with that kind of failure; it's untested,' says spokeswoman Heather Tiltson. 3.The FSCS would explore the possibility of other insurers taking on the manage ment of the fund. It could provide short-term financial assistance to the insurer to enable this to happen. 4. If other options failed, it would look into compensation. In theory, this would be payable at 100 per cent of the first \u00a32,000 owed and 90 per cent above that. But - and there are many ifs and buts here - members could end up being very disappointed. The fund would have to be valued by the liquidator and probably also by an independent actuary. 'There might be some questions on the value, the guaranteed bonuses and benefits,' says Tiltson. 'There aren't any guarantees that we could guarantee the guarantees made by the insurer. The independent actuary could say that these benefits were excessive.' This means that annual bonuses which had been guaranteed to policyholders might not be honoured by the FSCS. In the case of Equitable, the use of the word 'guarantee' is, in any case, being restricted - so that annual bonuses are not necessarily going to be paid. 5. The process could take months or longer to sort out. 'People would have to recognise that it would be a complicated situation,' says Tiltson. 'It would take as long as it takes.' But special arrangements would almost undoubtedly be made to help tide over people facing financial hardship while waiting for their payments."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
