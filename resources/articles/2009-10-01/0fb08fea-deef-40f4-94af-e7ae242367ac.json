It has ever been thus. The passing of the years has done nothing to dilute Wenger's obsessive streak and you get the feeling that even if his birthday were to fall in the middle of July, he would still find games of some description on some obscure satellite channel to sate his appetite. \"Thursday will be very quiet,\" he said. \"I have nothing to celebrate.\" To Wenger, age is merely a state of mind. \"People at 40 can be young physically but old mentally and, in this job, it helps that you never have any certainty,\" he said. \"You always question and you always have to question yourself. I believe that's the basis of staying young in your head.\" Wenger refused to say how young he did feel, although he joked that \"as you get older, everybody will tell you there is a massive contrast between how you look and how you feel\". Suffice to say that he has not entertained the notion of retirement \u2013 \"I would want to work as long as I lived, but adapted to my potential,\" he said \u2013 and the vim and vigour of his current squad has helped to keep those fires burning. \"I am very excited about the future,\" he said ahead of tonight's Champions League Group H tie here in the Netherlands against Ronald Koeman's AZ Alkmaar. \"I am in a job where you always look in front of you. Unfortunately, the older you get, the less distance there is in front of you but football is exciting because when you have a team like I have now, it is absolutely exciting, because you know that we have potential and it's down to me to get it out.\" Wenger believes he has done a good job in that respect so far this season; that he has begun to answer in a convincing fashion the nay-sayers within the club's own fanbase. Arsenal's AGM last year was a tranquil affair but, in May, Wenger was put on the spot at a heated Q&amp;A session by shareholders who worried about the club's direction. They felt that Wenger was putting too much faith in young players and, amid an edgy atmosphere, they also questioned the commitment of certain members of the squad. For Wenger, it was a low ebb. Arsenal's exciting start to the new season then, in which they have scored 27 goals in eight Premier League games, not to mention another 10 in four Champions League ties, including the qualifiers against Celtic, has brought a timely injection of belief. It ought to be pointed out that Arsenal are only two points better off in the league than they were at the corresponding point of last season, yet the defeats that they suffered against Fulham and Hull City were a portent of their disastrous November to come. \"I'm convinced that the fans believe we have a chance this season and that was not the case at the beginning of last season,\" Wenger said. To him, the thrill of the chase is everything; substance is nothing without style and he believes that with Robin van Persie, Andrey Arshavin and Cesc F\u00e1bregas in blistering form, his current team has the makings of his most exciting yet. \"In terms of goal potential, certainly,\" he said. \"We've shown that up to now and there are some offensive players who have not yet contributed, players like [Samir] Nasri, [Tomas] Rosicky and [Theo] Walcott. Eduardo [da Silva] and [Carlos] Vela have not played many games either.\" Van Persie, with five goals in his past six Arsenal appearances, was singled out for lavish praise. \"I think Robin is a [Marco] van Basten type,\" said Wenger, with a nod towards the Dutch legend, \"and by that I mean he's a technical centre-forward. He has that classy first touch, sharp movement and a short back-lift. I always thought he was more a first than a second striker.\" An Arsenal victory over Alkmaar would all but ensure their progress into the knock-out rounds of the Champions League. Wenger has thoughts only for this landmark."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
