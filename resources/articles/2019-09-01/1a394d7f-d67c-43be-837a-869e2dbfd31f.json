The clip has had more than 1.2m views on Twitter. While some viewers knew it was an actor pretending to crash her car, others seemed to miss the fairly obvious signs it was fictional, and some even sympathised. It wasn\u2019t her fault because \u201csomebody t-boned the shit out of her\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m glad she\u2019s OK because that was hilarious\u201d, were just some of the responses. The seven-part narrative series, Content, premiered on Wednesday on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and iView and has been given a major publicity boost after it was shared thousands of times on social media sites Twitter, Reddit and Facebook. The comedy features a young Brisbane woman called Lucy who wants to become an online influencer so she keeps the camera running no matter what happens to her \u2013 even a car crash. The slapstick comedy is pretty hard to miss though so it\u2019s surprising some people were fooled. The actor who plays Lucy, Charlotte Nicdao, was just as amazed by the clip\u2019s fame as everyone else, sharing it with the words \u201cDAISY IM VIRAL\u201d, a quote from the show. The show has been dubbed a \u201cvertical video series\u201d because it was filmed in a portrait ratio designed for a smartphone. Co-directed by Daley Pearson, the executive producer of the smash-hit animated kids show Bluey, it was inspired by how much time Pearson spends on his phone. \u201cIf I was to die and whatever god there was gave me stats on my life, I\u2019m pretty sure I would be shocked to find out how much of the relationships with people I love the most were lived through phones,\u201d he told Guardian Australia\u2019s Luke Buckmaster."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
