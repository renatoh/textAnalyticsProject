Mr Trimble warned that republicans needed to make \"hard decisions\" to break the deadlock over policing, demilitarisation and IRA disarmament. Speaking after a meeting with the prime minister, Tony Blair, Mr Trimble added: \"If there is failure to deal with these issues then obviously we have to take stock and a review is an obvious way of taking stock.\" Mr Trimble spent an hour in talks with Mr Blair but declined to say whether the meeting had left him more optimistic about the possibility of a breakthrough. Mr Blair also met today with nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party member Seamus Mallon, who urged the prime minister to call a round table meeting of all pro-agreement parties in a bid to end deadlocked discussions. Mr Trimble said: \"I very much hope there is a progress as a result of these meetings but we are as yet uncertain.\" He appealed to republican leaders to show the \"moral courage\" displayed by unionists. Mr Trimble added: \"It is time for people to shoulder their obligations and I think that is true of republicans as well as nationalists.\" Mr Mallon told the prime minister that with talks on decommissioning, policing and demilitarisation still deadlocked, there was about a week left to get an agreement. The meeting came as Sinn Fein considered legal action to stop chief constable Sir Ronnie Flanagan from starting a recruitment campaign for the new policing service. In Belfast, Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness warned that without the establishment of a policing board, the decision to go ahead would be illegal. Ahead of the today's meeting at Number 10, the Democratic Unionist party leader, the Reverend Ian Paisley, claimed the Northern Ireland peace process was now \"shattered\". Mr Paisley, a staunch critic of the Good Friday agreement, said Mr Trimble's recent warnings that the peace process could be heading for a review have dealt the process a critical blow. He said: \"It has been shattered by what Mr Trimble has said - that they now need to devise new workable democratic structures for the agreement.\" However, the Northern Ireland minister, John Reid, insisted he had been encouraged by the constructive tone of today's discussions. \"I think the positive nature of this morning's meetings means we will be able to carry through the process,\" he said. He said all the suggestions put forward would be discussed with the Irish government on his trip to Dublin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
