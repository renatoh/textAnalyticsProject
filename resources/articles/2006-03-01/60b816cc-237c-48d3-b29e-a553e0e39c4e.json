He will star in a new \"I Am What I Am\" ad campaign But Reebok's television ad starring US rapper 50 Cent that hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons. It was banned in the UK by the Advertising Standards Authority for glorifying gun violence. The furore over the ad prompted the industry watchdog to tell companies aiming at young people that they should choose the celebrities who endorse their products very carefully. Olympic silver medal winner Khan said: \"This is an amazing thing for me - I used to look up to sports stars such as Imran Khan and now it's going to be me on the billboard. \"I'm giving Asian kids out there a path to follow. This has given me a real boost in my quest to be world champion and I look forward to promoting boxing with Reebok in the UK and beyond.\" Reebok's first venture into boxing has seen the sportswear firm working alongside Khan to design and produce signature RbK gloves, kit and boots for all of his fights - starting with his next professional bout in Glasgow on March 25. Michael Price, the Reebok UK marketing director said: \"This is a really exciting partnership for Reebok and Amir Khan. It's great to be able to sign someone from Reebok's hometown ... he's a consummate professional and a real role model for modern British youth.\" As an amateur boxer Khan burst in to the public consciousness when he won a silver medal in the lightweight boxing category at the 2004 Athens Olympics. After beating Cuban Mario Kindelan at the Reebok Stadium - home of Amir's beloved Bolton Wanderers - to avenge his Olympic defeat, Khan turned professional and now has six professional wins under his belt. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
