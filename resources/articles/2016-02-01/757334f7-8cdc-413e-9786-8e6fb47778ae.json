It comes dusted with magic, glee and a sense that we can dream a better world. There are two lovely moments towards the end: in one, the tension between Ayesha Dharker\u2019s sexy Titania and Chu Omambala\u2019s brooding, regretful Oberon dissipates and they are reconciled with tenderness; in the other, the fairy children \u2013 dressed like returning second world war evacuees \u2013 stare across the auditorium as if glimpsing their own futures. Omambala\u2019s Oberon has real depth \u2013 he is an apparently cool cat in a sleek white suit but with melancholic undertones, and his relationship with Puck has an erotic undertow. The production will tour the country, at each location featuring actors from a local amateur group to play Shakespeare\u2019s rude mechanicals \u2013 the artisan performers who are rehearsing the entirely inappropriate tragedy of Pyramus and Thisbe to celebrate the nuptials of Theseus and Hippolyta. At the performance I saw they were played by members of Wyre Forest\u2019s Nonentities Society, who set about disproving their company\u2019s name with distinctiveness, gusto and real craft. The play within a play is blissfully funny, which isn\u2019t always the case. Chris Clarke\u2019s excellent Bottom dies with all the ridiculous flourish of the amateur actor enjoying his moment in the limelight. The tour and the community element earn this revival its add-on subtitle \u201ca play for the nation\u201d. But other meanings are delivered via Tom Piper\u2019s design that offers a bombed-out theatre and 1940s costumes, and a production that in its portrayal of women hints that the attitudes of the past are being swept away by a new order, leaving masculinity in crisis. Theseus is made uncomfortable by Hippolyta, Helena\u2019s RAF hero father finds himself out of step with new thinking, and Quince, played by Sue Downing, is a woman trying to take control as a director. The dust left by bombs is replaced by the vivid colours of the Hindu festival Holi, the sound of destruction by the jazzy beat of a new era as spring arrives in a shower of rose petals. Around it all skips Lucy Ellinson\u2019s delicious, androgynous Puck \u2013 part overenthusiastic artful dodger, part cross-dressing music-hall male impersonator \u2013 an impish ghost whose eyes pop with sheer wonder at this new world. \u2022 At Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 5 March, then 17 May to 16 July. To buy tickets, go to Guardian box office. On tour 16 March to 4 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
