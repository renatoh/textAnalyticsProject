The former chancellor Ken Clarke said second referendum campaigners had scuppered the chances of his motion on a customs union, which lost by just three votes. Clarke rejected the suggestion from the Green party\u2019s Caroline Lucas that a compromise motion of a customs union and a referendum would win support. \u201cIf you add the people\u2019s vote to a motion like mine, you lose votes all over the place \u2026 vote for something you have no objection to as a fallback position,\u201d he said. Referendum supporters immediately hit back at the criticism, pointing out that the vast majority of MPs had compromised and that at least four were absent for personal reasons. \u201cCooperation is needed, not competition, at this stage \u2013 and all of us fighting against a no-deal Brexit made that clear before these crucial votes,\u201d one senior Labour MP said. \u201cParliament has come closer to a solution in seven hours than the PM has in two years.\u201d Key backers of a second referendum, including the Independent Group (TIG), Liberal Democrats, and Labour referendum supporters such as Jo Stevens and Owen Smith, voted against Clarke\u2019s motion, which was also opposed by Labour leave supporters. The SNP instructed its 35 MPs to abstain. The Lib Dem Norman Lamb, who had urged his party to back a compromise, said he was furious with the result. \u201cI am so deeply distressed. I am ashamed to be a member of this parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have failed in our responsibility today. There has been far too much posturing and intransigence, including from my own party.\u201d Lamb said he believed the lack of compromise had pushed the UK closer to a no-deal exit. \u201cIt may now be too late,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t hold out much hope now. There is a very real chance we will crash out. We have failed twice now and failed because of people who broadly support a customs union not being willing to back it.\u201d Stephen Kinnock, one of the key campaigners with Nick Boles for the common market 2.0 plan, or Norway-style Brexit, said he had been prepared to compromise by voting for the second referendum option. \u201cIt was therefore very disappointing to see that 33 colleagues who are campaigning for a referendum chose not to reciprocate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt appears that some of us were acting in good faith and in a spirit of compromise whilst others were not.\u201d TIG\u2019s Anna Soubry said backers of a referendum had also tried to forge a compromise with soft Brexiters, but any efforts to draft a composite motion had been rejected. Soubry said she still hoped that a compromise to pair a soft Brexit with a referendum could be reached. \u201cThere is a way of getting this together. If you look at the figures, there is every chance on Wednesday we can find a compromise,\u201d she said. Days of intensive horse-trading in parliament convinced the Labour front bench and the Scottish National party to back common market 2.0. Yet the motion still failed to reach a majority by 21 votes, coming behind a second referendum and a customs union, a motion that fell by just three votes. After the result, Boles resigned on the floor of the House of Commons, blaming his failure to convince his own party to compromise. Supporters of a soft Brexit or a second referendum acknowledged during the course of the day that they had not managed to convince anything like sufficient numbers of Conservatives to back a compromise option, with insufficient support for a stable majority to pass legislation for any compromise. One significant intervention came on Monday afternoon. The Tory MP Huw Merriman, a parliamentary aide to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, wrote a letter to all MPs on Monday urging them to back the Peter Kyle motion for a referendum, saying he had got to the point where he believed it was preferable to a customs union. \u201cIf, like me, you are not a supporter of this option, then I am appealing to you to consider the confirmatory vote option,\u201d he wrote, though he said he sympathised with a constituent who compared the choice to \u201casking which leg he would like amputated\u201d. Fifteen Tory MPs backed the motion for a second referendum. However, some MPs fear that Tories sympathetic to a second referendum have been spooked by the treatment of Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general who backed a fresh public vote and lost a vote of no confidence at an angry local association meeting last week. \u201cTories saw the video of that meeting and are now thinking, \u2018I don\u2019t want any of that,\u2019\u201d one People\u2019s Vote source said. MPs still believe Clarke\u2019s motion for a customs union has a high chance of success should MPs bring back another round of indicative votes on Wednesday. However, the Labour MP Clive Lewis, a backer of a second referendum, said the cross-party coalition in favour of a softer Brexit would not hold for binding votes. \u201cAlthough a customs union and common market 2.0 did well, they did so with the votes of MPs like me who would only support them in binding votes if they were then put to the people,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
