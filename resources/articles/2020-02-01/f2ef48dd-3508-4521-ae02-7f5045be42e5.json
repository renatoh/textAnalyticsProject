While Chelsea\u2019s manager said greater focus was key to his inconsistent side\u2019s 2-1 home win over Spurs on Saturday, he knows they are likely to come under severe pressure in the first leg of their last-16 Champions League tie against Bayern. Lampard believes it will take a performance of immense tactical discipline to progress against the German champions, who reached the knockout stages by winning all six of their group games. He also spoke about the importance of making sure the tie is still alive before the second leg in Munich on 18 March. Bayern have far more experience at this level than a youthful Chelsea side and they enjoyed their last trip to London, smashing Spurs 7-2. Spurs chased the game after falling behind and Lampard does not want his defence to become exposed against a finisher of Robert Lewandowski\u2019s class. \u201cWe\u2019ve got players with Champions League experience in this group, as well as younger players in the early stages of their careers, particularly in the Champions League,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cThey have to understand why I keep talking about the levels going up, and what the mindset levels are. A big part of my job is to explain to the players that over two legs we need to be at our maximum. \u201cGoing into the game we must make sure every box is ticked in both games. We can\u2019t get caught up in game moments. After the game, we will probably suffer. Bayern Munich are an incredible side with the ball. They\u2019ve got some really talented players who keep the ball and use the ball well. If we have to suffer, we have to suffer. That\u2019s our job over the next two games.\u201d Chelsea had gone four league games without a win before facing Spurs and Lampard, who could bring Willian and Tammy Abraham in for Ross Barkley and Olivier Giroud respectively, spoke to his players about developing a more ruthless mindset before they faced their London rivals. \u201cI felt if you look at our recent form in the league, we were playing well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to keep saying that. A lot of parts of our game are good but the important parts of the game, which is in the final third, scoring goals, finishing off what you\u2019ve created and then making sure we don\u2019t concede with absolute focus, were slightly short. It was clear we were slightly short. \u201cIf you have 20 shots in a game and don\u2019t score, and the other team have two and score, and that\u2019s recurring, then that\u2019s an issue. When I wrote that down, it felt like a mindset thing. If you\u2019re not scoring, it can be a mixture of many things. It can be confidence. It could also maybe be something that\u2019s slack, slightly, or how you prepare through the week. \u201cIt was just about being honest. The beauty of the meeting was everyone felt the same. I\u2019ve been in meetings where people can\u2019t find the reason \u2013 even if the managers says what it is and players disagree. But I\u2019ve got a really good group. The reaction to the meeting, and the reaction against Tottenham, was spot on. What we can\u2019t do now is forget what made us beat Spurs. That was a start for us on Saturday. We need to keep going.\u201d Lampard captained the side when Chelsea upset the odds by beating Bayern on penalties in the 2012 Champions League final. He is not concerned if they are the underdogs again. \u201cMy job is just to prepare for the game and look at the opponent, see their strengths, see our strengths and ask can we find weaknesses there?\u201d he said. \u201cI understand if people do call us the underdogs because Bayern Munich are so strong. Maybe we don\u2019t have that experience but these things are there to change. It\u2019s there to turn to turn it around, to overcome being the underdog. Those are the best stories in sport.\u201d Lampard is expected to play three at the back again and he said his team were up in front when C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, Chelsea\u2019s captain, caught him with a heavy challenge during a keep-ball session in training. \u201cThank God it was Azpi, because he\u2019s in the team regularly,\u201d the manager joked. \u201cI\u2019d be worried if it was someone who wasn\u2019t playing a lot, going in with two feet.\u201d Bayern top the Bundesliga by a point and have improved since replacing Niko Kovac with Hans-Dieter Flick in November. Flick noted that Chelsea make mistakes at the back and said Lewandowski, who has scored 40 goals in all competitions this season, is in the form of his life. Joshua Kimmich explained how Bayern have become more dangerous in attack since Flick was placed in caretaker charge. \u201cThe way we play football has changed a bit,\u201d the midfielder said. \u201cWe try to attack higher up the pitch and try to force mistakes and take more risks when we attack. I\u2019d be very happy with the result we got against Tottenham.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
