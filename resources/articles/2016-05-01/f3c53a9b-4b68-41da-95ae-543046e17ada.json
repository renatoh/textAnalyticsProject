The first lady has been a crusader against childhood obesity through her Let\u2019s Move initiative and vowed to continue the fight in her political afterlife. \u201cThe truth is, is that it actually doesn\u2019t matter where I\u2019m sitting eight months from now,\u201d she told delegates at the Partnership for a Healthier America meeting. \u201cWhat matters is that we all keep standing together on behalf of our kids.\u201d Obama added to applause: \u201cAnd while next year I will no longer be first lady, I just want you to know that I will always be here as a partner in this effort \u2013 always. So I\u2019m not here today to give a victory speech, and these certainly aren\u2019t my closing remarks on this issue \u2013 just the opposite. I was passionate about this issue long before I became first lady, and I plan to work on it long after I leave the White House.\u201d She praised the work of Partnership for a Healthier America and announced that, for first time in 20 years, the FDA has produced a new nutrition facts label that will be on nearly 800,000 food products nationwide. The calorie count is bigger, the serving sizes more accurate and the quantity of sugar added in processing will be shown. \u201cSo very soon you will no longer need a microscope, a calculator, or a degree in nutrition to figure out whether the food you\u2019re buying is actually good for our kids.\u201d It is clearly an issue Obama takes personally. With her passion evident, she added: \u201cIf six years ago someone had told you that Fenway Park would have a 5,000 square foot farm on their rooftop to provide fresh produce for their fans, or that 50 million Americans would visit a government website called MyPlate to learn about healthy eating, or that sales of kale would jump 50 percent in just four years, or that the first unanimously chosen NBA MVP, Steph Curry, would choose fruits, vegetables, and water as his primary product endorsements ... \u201cIf someone had told you all that six years ago, you would have thought they had were out of their minds. But that\u2019s the kind of meaningful, tangible change that we\u2019re seeing throughout the country.\u201d The National Rifle Association endorsed Donald Trump for president at its national convention in Louisville, Kentucky, which Trump called \u201ca fantastic honor.\u201d Speaking at the NRA convention, Trump said if elected president, Hillary Clinton will try to end the right to bear arms by appointing progressive Supreme Court justices. \u201cIf she gets to appoint her judges, she will as, part of it abolish the second amendment. In my opinion that\u2019s what she\u2019s going for,\u201d said Trump, who called on Clinton to release a list of potential SCOTUS justices. Clinton has never said she wants to abolish the second amendment. Clinton immediately rebutted Trump\u2019s claim, tweeting: \u201cWe can uphold Second Amendment rights while preventing senseless gun violence.\u201d Trump may head to London to meet with UK prime minister David Cameron, after a week of tense insults from both sides. The Guardian understands that no formal invite was sent, despite Trump\u2019s claim, however a Downing St spokesperson said: \u201cThere is a long history of PMs seeing nominees if they visit the UK and the PM will be happy to do so once the nominees have been chosen.\u201d And as we go to the weekend, many on the Democrats side are looking to see what Bernie Sanders will do next - with pundits today noting that the longer the stays in the race, the more it helps Donald Trump, although thousands are still turning out at his rallies across the country. Ed Pilkington profiles Megyn Kelly, the Fox News reporter who regularly cops abuse from Donald Trump - but sat down to interview the presumptive Republican nominee earlier this week. Will the real Megyn Kelly please stand up? Is she the fearless moderator who made America gasp and Donald Trump splutter when she fired the opening question of the first Republican presidential TV debate last August, reminding the billionaire that he had described various women as \u201cfat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals\u201d? Or is she the Megyn Kelly who turned up for work this week, marking her truce with Trump after nine months of sustained vitriol on his part, with a soft-soap interview on Fox that was as sharp and memorable as blancmange? This week\u2019s interview was a rare opportunity to hold the presumptive Republican nominee to account over his extremist platform on Hispanic immigrants, Muslims and women. Instead, she chose to ask him to describe the context in which he tweets: \u201cI\u2019m picturing, like, a crushed velvet smoking jacket, chaise lounge, slippers,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe not as fancy as that,\u201d Trump replied, squirming in his seat along with 4.8 million television viewers. \u201cIt was a lovefest,\u201d said Mark Feldstein, who reported for ABC News and CNN for 20 years before becoming a professor of journalism at the University of Maryland. \u201cShe achieved something very difficult with her gentle questioning: she made Donald Trump seem boring.\u201d The strange metamorphosis of Megyn Kelly, 45, from her jaw-dropping performance at the first TV debate to the fawning publicist we saw on our small screens this week is revealing. It tells us something about Kelly herself and the scope of her ambition; it tells us quite a lot more about the parlous state of American television; and it also offers clues to how the implausible candidacy of Trump has come to be. Read the rest of the article here. Clinton is responding to Trump\u2019s claim to the NRA convention today that she wants to abolish the second amendment. Clinton campaign spokesman John Podesta called Donald Trump\u2019s latest interviews on foreign policy \u201cunhinged at times,\u201d in a recently released statement. He [Trump] once again claimed that he can\u2019t share his great foreign policy ideas because he wants unpredictability. He aggressively defended his Muslim ban. He lied about his own record, claiming he opposed the Libya intervention and Iraq War -- both of which he supported at the outset. And he demonstrated once again his dangerous penchant for going ballistic on anyone who disapproves of his proposals. Rather than taking seriously criticism from former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates -- one of America\u2019s most well-respected foreign policy minds -- Trump responded with a long tirade attacking Gates. This is the same petulance that was on display when he recently cast doubt on our special relationship with the UK simply because David Cameron and London Mayor Sadiq Khan criticized his proposed Muslim ban, challenging the latter to an IQ test. This morning on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, Trump said Gates had \u201cno idea,\u201d after he criticized Trump\u2019s foreign policies yesterday. \u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of his,\u201d said Trump. MSNBC is reporting that a suspect with a weapon approached a White House guard near the fence of the White House, and was shot by the guard when they didn\u2019t drop the weapon. Seems it\u2019s already Summer Fridays in the White House, according to the AP: \u201cThe president was not on premises. He\u2019d left two hours earlier for an afternoon round of golf.\u201d Just away from the campaign trail for a second, but the White House is on lockdown after a shooting. A man was shot outside the White House on Friday afternoon, police told The Washington Post. The victim has been taken to hospital in a critical condition. The identity of the shooter is currently unknown. MSNBC reports that Barack Obama was not at the White House when the shooting occurred. The Clinton campaign retweeted an interview with a former Miss Universe contestant, the beauty pageant that Donald Trump used to own, speaking about how the presumptive Republican nominee called her \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d and publicly shamed her to lose weight. Lois Beckett is in Louisville for the NRA convention. The NRA refused to issue Guardian US with accreditation for its convention, so she is covering the event from outside. Speaking to NRA members at the group\u2019s annual meeting, Trump warned that Hillary Clinton would get to appoint \u201cthree to five\u201d Supreme Court justices. Trump, who released a list of his potential Supreme Court nominees earlier this week, called on Clinton to release her own list of Supreme Court picks. \u201cIt\u2019s day and night, it\u2019s day and night and it will not be good for the people in this room,\u201d he said. \u201cI do want to run against her, I have to be honest with you,\u201d he said. So, Trump told the NRA convention that Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the second amendment, by choosing Supreme Court justices who are anti-guns. But what evidence is there that Clinton wants to ban the right to bear and keep arms? None, says Politifact, a Pulitzer Prize-winning site which evaluates the accurateness of candidate comments. They examined Trump\u2019s claim in recent weeks: We found no evidence of Clinton ever saying verbatim or suggesting explicitly that she wants to abolish the Second Amendment, and the bulk of Clinton\u2019s comments suggest the opposite. She has repeatedly said she wants to protect the right to bear arms while enacting measures to prevent gun violence. Gun advocates say Trump\u2019s claim is backed up by Clinton\u2019s openness to a gun buyback program and her disagreement with a Supreme Court decision on the Second Amendment. But whether or not these two cherry-picked comments actually reveal Clinton\u2019s intentions is a matter of interpretation. For this claim to hold water, the support for Second Amendment abolition needs to be more direct. So we rate it False. Trump talked about his women problem at the NRA convention, as he called for more women to abandon Hillary Clinton and support him: My poll numbers with men are through the roof. I like women more than men, come on women! Donald Trump called on Bernie Sanders to run as an independent, since Hillary Clinton is the likely Democratic nominee. \u201cI think Bernie should run as an independent,\u201d said Trump. \u201cI want him to run as an independent. Then it would be the three of us on stage, I would love that.\u201d Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton would attempt to abolish the right to keep and bear arms, if elected, by appointing anti-gun justices to the Supreme Court. \u201cIf she gets to appoint her judges, she will as, part of it abolish the second amendment. In my opinion that\u2019s what she\u2019s going for,\u201d Trump told the NRA convention. He called on Clinton to release a list of possible Supreme Court nominees, as he did earlier this week. \u201cI\u2019d like to call for Hillary Clinton to put together a list,\u201d said Trump, who said the difference between his and Clintons list of nominees would be \u201cnight and day.\u201d Earlier today Trump tweeted an audio clip where Clinton is speaking about gun reform. \u201cShe\u2019s putting the most vulnerable Americans in jeopardy,\u201d said Trump, who even tried to turn it into a gender issue by saying that Clinton wanted to take guns away from women who use them to protect themselves. \u201cThat is so unfair. And that is so egregious,\u201d said Trump. \u201cHillary wants to disarm vulnerable Americans in high crime neighborhoods... Hillary wants them to be defenseless, wants them to take away any chance of survival,\u201d he said. \u201cHeartless hypocrites, like the Clintons, want to get rid of guns, but they have bodyguards who have guns,\u201d said Trump, who called for all of the Clintons bodyguards to be disarmed. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re going to call her Heartless Hillary... somehow I like Crooked Hillary better,\u201d said Trump. As the NRA endorses Donald Trump for president, let\u2019s remember this tweet from Trump back in 2012 after the Newtown massacre, where 20 children aged between six and seven were killed, along with six adults. Chris Cox, the executive director of the NRA\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action just formally announced the NRA\u2019s endorsement of Donald Trump for president. \u201cI did not know that. I knew I was doing well, but I did not know that,\u201d Donald Trump said. He called the endorsement \u201ca fantastic honor.\u201d \u201cI will not let you down,\u201d he promised. \u201cRemember that, I will not let you down.\u201d He also said his sons were better shooters than he is. Just before Trump took to the stage at the NRA convention, other gun enthusiasts spoke about the role of guns in the election. If Clinton gets to appoint a Supreme Court justice to replace gun rights champion Antonin Scalia, who died earlier this year, \u201cyou can kiss your guns goodbye,\u201d Wayne LaPierre told an audience of thousands of National Rifle Association members. \u201cThe Second Amendment is on the Ballot this November,\u201d Chris Cox, the director of the National Rifle Association\u2019 Institute of Legislative Action, said. The National Rifle Association has just endorsed Donald Trump for president at its convention. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be so proud of our country again,\u201d said Trump, as he addressed the convention, speaking about how he believes guns make the country safer. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching what\u2019s going on, I\u2019ve been looking at airplanes being blown up in the air,\u201d said Trump. \u201c[more guns will mean]we don\u2019t have to be so frightened, we don\u2019t have to be so afraid.\u201d \u201cParis, is probably, in the world, the toughest place to have guns,\u201d said Trump, referring to the terror attacks in Paris last November. \u201cIf you would have had guns on the other side... I promise, there wouldn\u2019t have been 130 people killed... it might not have happened... believe me, the carnage would not have been the same.\u201d As Obama\u2019s former chief speech writer Jon Favreau, has a way with words and he\u2019s not mincing them when it comes to Donald Trump, declaring him \u201ca dick.\u201d In the tweet, Favreau lists several criticisms of Trump, including that Trump hoped that for a housing crash to help his investments and had multiple lawsuits tied to his company\u2019s taxes. He then follow it up with a list of links to stories about each statement, apart from the \u201cdick\u201d one, which he simply credited as \u201cduh.\u201d He later called his tweets a \u201cmedia experiment.\u201d It was also announced today that Favreau has a gig working for Bill Simmon\u2019s soon-to-be-launched publication The Ringer, writing about the 2016 campaign, so some nice timing for a media experiment. Donald Trump may be heading to London to meet the prime minister, despite David Cameron calling his plan to ban Muslims from entering the US \u201cdivisive, stupid and wrong\u201d. \u201cHe would like me now to visit 10 Downing Street. They put out that invitation about two days ago,\u201d Trump told MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe on Friday morning. Downing Street acknowledged the invitation to the Guardian, which came after a week that saw a strained relationship with the the presumptive Republican nominee for the presidency of the UK\u2019s closest ally. \u201cIt\u2019s long-standing practice for the PM to meet with the Republican and Democrat presidential nominees if they visit the UK,\u201d said a Downing Street spokesperson in a statement. \u201cGiven the parties have yet to choose their nominees, there are no confirmed dates for this,\u201d the spokesperson added. That marks a change from December, when Cameron said of Trump: \u201cIf he came to visit our country, I think he would unite us all against him.\u201d Earlier this week the prime minister refused to back down from his criticisms of Trump. \u201cHe continues to believe that preventing Muslims from entering the US is divisive, stupid and wrong. He stands by his comments,\u201d said a Downing Street spokesperson. The billionaire businessman appeared in a sit-down interview with Piers Morgan, aired on Britain\u2019s ITV on Monday, questioning whether Cameron - whose behavior towards him Trump called \u201cinappropriate\u201d - was damaging the countries\u2019 relationship. \u201cIt looks like we\u2019re not going to have a very good relationship, who knows?\u201d said Trump. But today Trump seemed more conciliatory as he spoke of a possible visit to London. \u201cSo I will do just fine with David Cameron. I think he\u2019s a nice guy ... They have asked me to visit 10 Downing Street - and I might do it,\u201d he told Morning Joe. Last time Donald Trump made his tax returns public, he\u2019d paid $0 in income taxes to the federal government. As the Washington Post reports today: The disclosure, in a 1981 report by New Jersey gambling regulators, revealed that the wealthy Manhattan investor had for at least two years in the late 1970s taken advantage of a tax-code provision popular with developers that allowed him to report negative income. Today, as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Trump regularly denounces corporate executives for using loopholes and \u201cfalse deductions to \u201cget away with murder\u201d when it comes to avoiding taxes. \u201cThey make a fortune. They pay no tax,\u201d Trump said last year on CBS. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous, okay?\u201d Earlier this week Trump released a \u201cfinancial statement,\u201d but not his full tax returns, which he says he won\u2019t release until after the IRS complete its audit on his finances. Today there\u2019s a lot of discussion over whether Bernie Sanders needs to drop out ASAP to create party unity against Donald Trump, or if Hillary Clinton is being hypocritical for wanting him to withdraw, since she didn\u2019t back in 2008 when it was clear she was losing but had some momentum behind her. After Clinton\u2019s chat with CNN yesterday, where she declared she will be the Democratic nominee, the conversation has become even more focused on what should Sanders do now. MSNBC political correspondent Steve Kornacki just tweeted his take on the Sanders v Clinton battle: And it\u2019s true that looking back in 08 shows a lot of criticism of Clinton\u2019s \u201cscorched-earth\u201d policy from the time: Over at Slate, Jamelle Bouie criticized Sanders for focusing on the rules around elections rather than what happens if Trump wins. ..Sanders is attacking the coalition that elected Barack Obama\u2014the coalition that arguably made his progressive movement possible \u2014 whether he realizes it or not. This coalition is predominantly nonwhite, centered in black and Latino communities, and it\u2019s the reason Clinton stands as the likely nominee. These voters have enabled liberals to, for the first time, craft a national coalition that doesn\u2019t have to shy from questions of racial justice and gender equality, or \u2014 like the Democratic Party of Bill Clinton \u2014 acquiesce in the face of white backlash, subsuming nonwhite concerns to the anxieties of white voters. And critically, these voters are among those Americans with the most to lose if Sanders decides that his shot at the nomination \u2014 or at changing debate and primary rules \u2014 is more important than keeping Donald Trump from the White House. And all of this is counterproductive to his stated goal of pulling the Democratic Party to the left. Eugene Robinson at the Washington Post says that he backs Sanders political philosophies, but if he stays in the race it just helps Trump: Instead of accepting this obvious fact, the Sanders campaign is behaving like a 2-year-old who can\u2019t have ice cream for breakfast. All along, Sanders and his aides have claimed that the party establishment was unfairly tipping the scales in favor of Clinton. Now the Sanders people have gone further and are deliberately stoking anger and a sense of grievance \u2014 less against Clinton than the party itself. This is reckless in the extreme, and it could put Trump in the White House. What do you think of the position Sanders is in? Should he keep battling it out to the convention? Let us know in the comments. Chris Christie\u2019s pained facial expressions standing behind Donald Trump during the presumptive nominee\u2019s Super Tuesday victory speech made the New Jersey governor a national laughing stock. On Thursday Christie got reimbursed up to $400,000 for his dignity. In a campaign fundraiser at a National Guard armory in a bucolic Trenton suburb, Trump gave a speech to a crowd of hundreds, many of whom had paid up to $200 to attend. Trump stuck to familiar themes about immigration and trade, adding a new wrinkle by saying: \u201cWho the hell cares if there\u2019s a trade war [with China]?\u201d The event, accompanied by a high-dollar fundraiser for the New Jersey Republican party, represented a Trump rally in miniature. The same blaring soundtrack, the same ardent shouts of \u201cbuild the wall,\u201d but all for the first time to a paying crowd, in an attempt to clear outstanding campaign debt from Christie\u2019s unsuccessful presidential bid. The presumptive nominee boasted as he took the stage: \u201cChris paid off his entire debt tonight. The whole debt!\u201d Read the rest here Hello, and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House. Yesterday Hillary Clinton declared herself the next Democratic nominee, calling her lead against Bernie Sanders \u201cinsurmountable\u201d. \u201cI will be the nominee for my party \u2026 That is already done, in effect. There is no way that I won\u2019t be,\u201d she told Chris Cuomo from CNN. But Sanders isn\u2019t hanging up his trademark glasses yet, hosting a rally in Sante Fe, New Mexico, at 1pm, followed by another in Albuquerque at 4pm. The fact that Sanders is still fighting for the nomination is angering many on Team Clinton, with a former Clinton aide telling The Hill: \u201cThis is the worst case scenario and the one people feared the most.\u201d Now with rallies planned all weekend for Sanders, pundits are looking to see what the Vermont senator does next. Meanwhile, presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump \u2013 who was in New Jersey yesterday for an event with Chris Christie, which raised $400,000 to pay off the debts of his campaign foe turned surrogate \u2013 went on a tweeting rampage early this morning, starting at around 5.30am, using his favorite new nickname for Clinton, after she called him \u201cnot qualified\u201d to be president yesterday. \u201cI get up nice and early,\u201d Trump said on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe this morning. \u201cYou know, Hillary said some things and I said some things and now I go and I go back to work and I have a lot of fun.\u201d As one reporter pointed out:"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
