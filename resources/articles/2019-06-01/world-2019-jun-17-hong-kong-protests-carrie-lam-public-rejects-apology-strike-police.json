The police commissioner, Stephen Lo Wai-Chung, said officers had followed procedure when he was asked about reports that police used medical records to search hospitals for protesters. \u201cWhenever there are people delivered to the emergency ward, there is a responsibility for police to check whether it is an accident, natural sickness, or [if they were] involved in certain crimes,\u201d he said.\u201cThe allegation that we are going to hospitals, chasing people to disturb their treatment, I disagree.\u201d As the city\u2019s crisis entered its second week, protesters kept up pressure on Chief Executive Carrie Lam by re-occupying streets outside the shuttered legislature building and welcoming the city\u2019s most prominent political activist, Joshua Wong, on his release from jail. Hong Kong was electrified by a record march on Sunday, the third major demonstration in a week. Organisers claimed that nearly 2 million people turned out to oppose an extradition law pushed by Lam, called for her resignation, condemned police brutality against protesters and demanded they drop any rioting charges. The police commissioner, Stephen Lo Wai-Chung, refused to apologise for police use of teargas, rubber bullets and truncheons, saying their hand was forced when \u201ca minority\u201d turned to violence on Wednesday. He claimed police use of riot charges for some of those arrested over the showdown, had been misunderstood, however. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying that the public gathering on that day was a riot,\u201d Lo told a late night press conference. \u201cSome protesters used violence, that\u2019s why the situation was a riot. As for other peaceful protesters \u2026 they need not worry about the riot crime.\u201d Of 32 people arrested over the demonstrations so far, only five have been charged with rioting offences, he said. The legal designation of \u201criot\u201d has been a focus of concerns because it means protesters face heavier sentences. The response was unlikely to satisfy protesters who marched under slogans including \u201cthey are kids, not rioters\u201d and have been emboldened by the government\u2019s unexpected climbdown over the extradition bill. The crowds on Monday were tiny by comparison to Sunday, but participants remained committed. \u201cThis is Hong Kong\u2019s future at stake, it\u2019s really important,\u201d said one 29-year-old protester, who had skipped work to attend. He said his boss knew where he was, but asked not to be named because he feared arrest after roundups including hospital detentions. The timing of Wong\u2019s release on Monday after serving half of a two-month sentence on a contempt charge was coincidental. He rose to prominence during the 2014 pro-democracy \u201cumbrella movement\u201d, and had been finishing a sentence for his role in those protests when Hong Kongers took to the streets again. He wasted no time adding his name to the cause. When he arrived at the protest site in the early afternoon, he told reporters he was in the same clothes he wore when he was jailed, not even taking time to return home and wash or change. \u201c[The protests] showed the spirit and dignity of the Hong Kong people,\u201d Wong said. He urged her to withdraw the controversial law and step down. Sunday was the largest demonstration in Hong Kong\u2019s history and the potent display of public anger pushed Lam to apologise for her handling of the crisis in a statement, but she did not respond to demonstrators\u2019 key demands. Many have sworn they will not rest until she goes. \u201cI know this is going to be a serious fight, but I think it is somehow necessary,\u201d said a 22-year-old student who gave his name as Draven. \u201cWe all know that just one protest is not going to have any long-term impact; we have to go further to let the government know what we need.\u201d That includes bringing an end to Lam\u2019s leadership, he said. China, which handpicked Lam for the job, has stood by her publicly. The foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Monday she had the government\u2019s support. But analysts and opposition politicians said her campaign to force through a much-criticised bill, and her repeated misreading of the public mood as Hong Kong\u2019s people rose up against it, had fatally undermined her authority. \u201cHer government cannot be an effective government, and will have much, much, much difficulties to carry on,\u201d the Democratic party legislator James To told the government-funded broadcaster RTHK. The extradition law at the heart of the crisis would allow both residents and visitors to be sent to China for trial in opaque, communist-controlled courts, which many in Hong Kong fear would prove a devastating blow to their economy and society. The city functions as a regional business and trade hub, protected from China by its judicial \u201cfirewall\u201d. Without that protection everyone from dissidents to business tycoons could be at risk; some of the city\u2019s wealthy have reportedly already started moving assets abroad over fears about the new law\u2019s impact.
