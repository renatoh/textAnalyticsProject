The grumbles on the way home will have been more straightforward. Going a goal down in the second half after missing a bundle of chances and Dean Ashton's failure to convert a penalty awarded to the home side in the 89th minute. The penalty itself was confusing enough. Norwich's Calum Davenport was initially shown a yellow card after going down following a tackle from Bobby Convey. The referee then ran to the linesman following complaints from the Norwich players and pointed to the spot. Reading's fans reacted with disbelief and their manager, Steve Coppell, was not happy. 'When the referee started brandishing the yellow card I thought the decision was made,' he said. 'The referee's power was diminished out there - he was closer then the linesman. The decision-making process was completely wrong.' But Reading were reprieved. And the penalty miss aside, what really let Norwich down was their inability to profit from their possession and attacks in the first half. Ashton, Andy Hughes and Kevin Lisbie all put pressure on the Reading defence. Coming on the back of a promising run in the league - their first two wins coming in the last three weeks - Norwich could have been forgiven their optimism. But the Reading defenders held firm and their tally of clean sheets - the highest in the league at six this season - remains undisturbed. And it was midfielder James Harper who eventually broke the deadlock - testimony again to Coppell's range of goalscoring options - firing in on the rebound from an initial shot blocked by Gary Docherty. Questions were asked about Ashton's fitness. He had suffered concussion in the first half after a collision in front of goal, but manager Nigel Worthington insisted he had been fine to continue: 'He had wanted to stay on and he wanted to take the penalty, it's just unfortunate for us that he missed it. Over the course of 90 minutes our performance was very good. On another day we'd have put a couple away.' Man of the match Harper - showed goalscorer's instinct."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
