The media regulator, Ofcom, approved the change provisionally, saying it would \u201cincrease choice and availability of public-service broadcast content, and help ensure the BBC remains relevant in the face of changing viewing habits\u201d. The BBC had said it feared for the corporation\u2019s future unless it were allowed to make the change. It said younger audiences, who were used to watching programmes on Netflix, struggled to understand why shows would disappear from iPlayer after just a few weeks, potentially undermining their willingness to pay the \u00a3154.50 annual licence fee. BBC iPlayer pioneered video streaming in the UK, but is now a relatively minor player. It had a 40% share of the market five years ago, but this has slumped to 15% following the explosive growth of Netflix and other streaming services. Under the current system, the first episode of a popular series often vanishes from iPlayer before the final programme has been shown, meaning there is no option to watch an entire series as a box set. The availability of individual programmes on iPlayer may rely on negotiations with the independent production companies that make shows for the BBC. Many BBC programmes are likely to transfer to the forthcoming paid-for BritBox service after 12 months, which will require an additional subscription on top of the licence fee. The BBC also won approval for children\u2019s programmes to remain on iPlayer for up to five years, creating an archive of material designed to appeal to parents and younger viewers. Ofcom said the change would hit some other catch-up services supported by advertising such as ITV Hub and All 4, but that it was justified to promote British public service broadcasting in the face of challenges from US-based companies. Competitors such as Sky, which owns the Now TV streaming service, had raised concern about the impact on commercial services, and had suggested the change could ultimately make it harder for Sky customers to access catch-up BBC content. The BBC will have to provide regular assessments on the impact iPlayer is having on its rivals as part of the approval process. Final approval is expected in August, but it could take some time before viewers are able to enjoy the benefit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
