Buy shares in the Royal Mail, one of the oldest long-distance communication enterprises in the world \u2013 or take a punt on Twitter, one of the newest. The internet has created plenty of work for postmen delivering parcels despatched by online shops, but written messages more often travel in bits and bytes than envelopes these days. The Royal Mail delivers to 29m addresses in the UK \u2013 and sends more mail on its way overseas. But Twitter claims 215 million active monthly users, and is growing fast, with its following up from 150 million a year ago. Comparisons are less flattering when it comes to hard cash. Royal Mail Group has an annual turnover of \u00a39bn, while Twitter tapped advertisers for a mere $316m (\u00a3197m) in 2012 and despite being seven years old has never turned a profit. Which means that, while Royal Mail generates \u00a3310 in revenue per address, Twitter's active addresses produce just $1.47 of revenue each \u2013 around 92p per year. The 500-year-old postal service will float at about \u00a33.3bn \u2013 a shadow of the $12.8bn (\u00a38bn) Twitter is likely to raise. But the Royal Mail is considered a sure bet. Analysts say its value could soon rise to as much as \u00a34.5bn, thanks to changes in the law that will allow it to set higher delivery prices. Twitter's digital precursors suggest room for growth is potentially stratospheric. Facebook made $5bn in revenues last year, Google $31bn. But the Twitter feed does not lend itself as easily to advertising as a search engine. Unlike Facebook, it is not the internet version of a telephone directory. Twitter is a soapbox for those with something to say, and if its users do not like the way advertising is introduced, they will say something."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
