There are many communisms, he argues, but roughly the same Marxist-Leninist model has been employed, with variations, around the globe. Marx argued that under communism, the state would cease to exist. But as Service shows, the exact opposite happened, the state becoming a bloated monster, squashing indigenous cultures and religions and intruding into private lives. The first communist state was a genuine innovation, he admits, although the Bolsheviks were never very popular. Winning over working people has always been a problem for communist leaders, the solution usually being a dictatorship in their name. While Service examines the bloody legacy of communism, he does not overlook capitalism's failings: corrupt elites and brutal security forces are not the sole preserve of communists. China is now practising capitalist communism, says Service, although via the country's media, its rulers are continuing a long tradition of isolating the people from reality. Ian Pindar William Wilberforce: The Life of the Great Anti-Slave Campaigner, by William Hague (Harper Perennial, \u00a39.99) In this enjoyable biography the shadow foreign secretary is keen to point out that slavery was opposed by the right as well as the left, albeit for economic rather than humanitarian reasons. Hague also reveals how Wilberforce's religious convictions drove him on, despite a relentless self-criticism that might have felled a lesser man. There are few surprises here, but Hague makes us appreciate anew the sheer scale of the parliamentary task facing Wilberforce, taking us back to a time when there were no fixed parties, only loose coalitions of men. Eventually, Wilberforce managed to convince even the House of Lords, leaving only the future William IV bleating against abolition. On the domestic front, Wilberforce was of a distinctly \"conservative disposition\", opposing an inquiry into the Peterloo massacre and supporting the Six Acts intended to reduce radical activism. Hazlitt's complaint that Wilberforce \"preaches vital Christianity to untutored savages, and tolerates its worst abuses in civilised states\" is difficult to rebut. This edition also includes Hague's 2007 speech on human trafficking, given on the bicentenary of the abolition of slavery. IP The Queen of Whale Cay, by Kate Summerscale (Harper Perennial, \u00a37.99) While working as an obituarist in 1993, Kate Summerscale stumbled upon the remarkable story of Marion Barbara Carstairs, a notorious 1920s eccentric who later fell into obscurity. Born in 1900, Marion soon realised she was not like other little girls and determined to reinvent herself as Joe. A cross-dresser for the rest of her days, she went on to race power boats for Britain, establishing herself as the fastest woman on water, and also became a leading light of the glamorous lesbian demi-monde. Tiring of celebrity, she left England in 1934 and bought the island of Whale Cay in the West Indies, where she ruled over 500 imported Bahamians and entertained an unusual array of actresses, duchesses and priests. Tallulah Bankhead and Marlene Dietrich featured among her many conquests, but her greatest love was reserved for a 12-inch doll named Lord Tod Wadley, who was her constant companion throughout her life. Her biography has all the ingredients for a delightfully subversive read, yet oddly it somehow fails to fully engage. As Carstairs once put it, \"I never felt anything about myself\", and sadly it's hard not to feel the same way. Aimee Shalan Fusiliers: How the British Army Lost America But Learned to Fight, by Mark Urban (Faber, \u00a39.99) Dedicated to \"those who serve honourably in unpopular wars\", this compelling military history retells the story of the battle for America which gave birth to the most powerful nation on earth. Plotting a route to circumvent the national mythologising of American authors, Urban also avoids the distortions of British histories of this period, which tend to portray its officers as nothing more than \"useless upper-class twits\". Drawing on unpublished sources, he gets under the skin of a single group of men, who were involved in the first fight at Lexington in 1775 and campaigned right through to Yorktown in 1781, when the British venture finally came to grief. Their first-hand accounts bring to life the subtle workings of the 18th-century army, and Urban has a lively flair for finding the right balance between personal detail and the broader effect of their long, painful fight on the army's development. Most striking, though, is how very small-scale it all was, despite bringing about one of the great seismic shifts of global history. In fact, more men deserted due to romances with American women than were actually killed in action. AS Scotland: The Autobiography, edited by Rosemary Goring (Penguin, \u00a310.99) Covering 2,000 years of history as seen by eyewitnesses, this marvellous anthology features all the personalities and decisive events you'd expect to find, but also encompasses \"what the commoner was experiencing\" in particular epochs. So alongside pieces by or on William Wallace, Mary Queen of Scots, James VI and I, Adam Smith, David Livingstone, Bannockburn, Flodden and Culloden are extracts covering such themes as industry, inventions, food, manners, entertainment, sport and social problems. The line-up of writers is strikingly stellar, including Tacitus, Daniel Defoe, James Boswell, David Hume and Walter Scott as chroniclers, plus Robert Louis Stevenson, Arthur Conan Doyle and Muriel Spark on the origins of their most famous creations. Seriousness and humour are perfectly balanced: wrenching accounts of the Glencoe massacre are offset by Jane Carlyle's droll account of presenting her husband Thomas's tax return to inspectors, or Max Beerbohm's wicked review of Peter Pan. It will be surprising if this superbly edited collection does not become the model for other countries' autobiographies.
