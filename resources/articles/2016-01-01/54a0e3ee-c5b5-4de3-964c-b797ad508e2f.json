That\u2019s us, The People, signing off from Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Massachusetts in these United States of America. It\u2019s been a resounding victory for the visitors who silenced a massive crowd with some excellent ... play. Only it\u2019s not a game one seems to actually \u201cplay\u201d so much as contest like one would a ... well, a fight. A fight with big sticks, at speed, on ice. Some stats: Shots on goal: Montreal 30 Boston 28 Hits: Montreal 18 Boston 29 Goals on Power Player: Montreal (0-4) Boston (0-3) Stars: 3rd Matt Beleskey 2nd Mike Condon 1st Brendan Gallagher Right. Thanks for your viewership, readership, however you consume these missives on this interesting little piece of modern media. I\u2019m Matt Cleary. It\u2019s been a pleasure. Good luck, good night and happy new year to you. Minute to go, 5 goals to one, they\u2019re still going at each other, these teams, Original Six from 1924. Ten seconds to go. Now five. Now one... and ... THEY\u2019RE FIGHTING! THEY\u2019RE FIGHTING TO FINISH THE GAME, THERE\u2019S NO SHAKING HANDS RATHER THEY\u2019RE THROWING PUNCHES AND WRESTLING, AND THAT\u2019S THE BALL GAME, THE PUCK GAME, stick a fork in this baby, it\u2019s done and done. GOOOALLL... etc. Poor Tuukka Rask parries one hot shot then sees the puck whacked home by a Canadien, Paul Byron, his second goal, assist by PK Subban the Generous. Canadiens, now, sluicing about, sharing the puck between themselves ... Max Patch the captain hurls up rink but is gathered by several Bruins. Boston attack. Montreal defend. And then attack. They\u2019re good, these Canadiens, hot skill with the stick in the face of committed D-men with .... and there\u2019s some fighting! Headlocks ... and Jimmy Hayes and Lars Eller, they go at it ... some punches thrown, none that knock the top off a cream puff ... but they both make the long walk of shame off the rink and into the warm bowels of this fine stadium. Makes sense. Vision now of PK Subban, he lobbed at the stadium early in a purple suit that screamed ballroom-dancing gangster. Word is he gave $10 million to charity, what a nice man. Okay - Tuukka Rask, with 5 minutes to go, he\u2019s been in this game, he\u2019s saved goals twice in this movement, as they all pile in and the goals themselves are dislocated. You can\u2019t pin this probable loss, in the 910th meeting of these teams, on Tuukka Rask. You could. But you would be wrong. Bruins, doing their best, big Chara has a shot, the tallest man ever in the National Hockey League, 7 foot in skates, there\u2019s a lot of him. Bruins bombing away. Shots on goal heading towards parity now, 29-29 to the Canadiens who have also been more effective. And their goal-keeper Micky Condon\u2019s done well also. Joe Morrow shoots! And Condon saves, reflexes of a lynx from Canada. Big men, skating about, either side of the goal, flicking the puck to each other at speed. Gallagher cops another hit in the face with a stick, an occupational hazard for the man, so often is he in the ruck doing his best. And: ad time. Okay. And they\u2019ve hurt Tuukka Rask, the puck has whacked into his throat... yowza! That is not good for the oesophagus, and no argument. Vision also of Max the captain of the Canadiens, he hurt his arm on a camera that was sticking out of a little hole in the plexi-glass, and was cranky at the shooter man. So many things can hurt you in this game, you\u2019d struggle to get health insurance. Okay - we\u2019re back, our man Rask is back in goal, puck still embedded in his throat, he plays on, for he knows no other way. And while all this was going on a slapshot whacks directly into a camera man\u2019s nose. It\u2019s like Cirque De Soleil on ice with violence. Okay, desperate times for the Bruins and the crowd are enervated by their endeavour. 11:31 in the match, technically plenty, physically not as easy given the hardness of these Canadiens. GOAL! CANADIENS ARE IN AGAIN, THEY HAD A BREAKAWAY, A TWO ON ONE, GALLAGHER SHOT A LITTLE SAUCER PASS FOR HIS CAPTAIN TO SLOT THE GOAL AWAY, MAX PACIORETTY, GETS THE GOAL AND THIS PUPPY IS OVER. THE BRUINS COMEBACK IS DONE AND DUSTED AND THE HUGE CROWD SIT DOWN AGAIN, STUNNED LIKE SO MANY MULLETS. HA! HUGE PILE UP IN THE CANADIENS GOAL THERE\u2019S JUST ABOUT EVERYONE ALL WHACKING AWAY AND SCRAPPING FOR THE PILL IT WAS LIKE THE BOXING DAY SALES GIVING AWAY FREE TELEVISIONS, AN ALL-IN AND ... after all that ... a man emerges with a sore face, and it\u2019s a puck down and restart. And onwards we roll, in this all-action big-whackin\u2019 puck action. TV showing a replay of Beleskey\u2019s many \u201chits\u201d, the times when he has whacked Canadiens into boards, etc, he\u2019s been a physical presence, and deserves that score. The shot-gap is now 25-20 and one wonders have the Canadiens shut up shop to protect a lead. Certainly the Bruins are coming hard and desperate, trying to reel in this two-goal deficit. Here come the Canadiens, with Rask making another tough save look easy, the puck is shot at him at 900 miles per hour, thereabouts, and the man with the reflexes of a puma, say, or a Canada lynx, has kept his team in this fixture yet again. Snowing! It\u2019s snowing in Boston! Hurrah, and kaloo-kalay, and all that, it\u2019s nudging 90F here in Sydney at 7:50am on January 2 on this dark side of the moon. GOOOALLL! THEY\u2019RE ON THE BOARD, THE BRUINS, THE PUCK SHOT IN HARD AND CONDON DID WELL BUT MATT BELESKEY GOT ON THE END OF THE SCRAPPY ICE-PILL, AND TIPPED IT IN AND WE HAVE A GAME, THE HUGE CROWD IS BUBBLING ABOUT LIKE SO MANY BEES, WITH BEERS. Okay - Dale Weiss will not be back, his hand is bung, the vulcanised rubber puck is an unforgiving frozen rock. Bruins attack early in a power play, still, but not for long. Indeed there\u2019s one more rush ... 7 seconds left ... shot.... nearly. Condon makes another save, he\u2019s had a solid game including one spectacular effort in the final second of Period Two. Five on five again, Bruins attack, Canadiens repel. Penalty, little Brendan Gallagher, he holds back not at all, a feisty man. Tom Brady signed one goal-keeper\u2019s mask and there\u2019s a picture of him on the other one. So there you go. Bruins, doing their best, but Canadiens, their defence is chunky. Desperate times for Boston. Okay - we\u2019re nearly back, The People, and the Boston Bruins, playing host to Montreal Canadiens in front of a sell-out crowd here at Gillette Stadium, Foxboro, Massachusetts, this brave new year\u2019s Winter Classic, have 20 minutes of playing time to somehow reel in a 3-goal deficit. They showed good signs in the latter half of the second period but ... you\u2019d suggest they need the reincarnation of Gretzky and/or the Hanson Brothers from Slapshot, because their busiest player has been goal-tender Tuukka Rask. No worries here: Over the glass goes the puck and out into the crowd where it hopefully hasn\u2019t hurt anyone. And old mate who did the whacking into the crowd is penalised because he did it, whacked it on purpose into the crowd. You can\u2019t put heads on statues, as they say. Right - power play, Bruins, seconds left in the period - SHOT! WITH 0.1 SECONDS LEFT IN THE PERIOD MIKE CONDON RIPS OFF A BRILLIANT SAVE TO KEEP HIS TEAM IN THE LEAD BY THREE TO NOTHING. IT\u2019S TIME FOR THE 2ND INTERMISSION and I\u2019ll stop yelling now. And we\u2019ll be back after these important messages. GOOOAAALLLLLLL, it\u2019s the feisty bantam slugger Brendan Gallagher who\u2019s backhanded the puck out of the air and into the net, and with two minutes to go in the second period, the massive crowd at Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Massachusetts, these United States of America are close to stunned mullets. Bit over four minutes left in the 2nd period, sports fans, and it\u2019s Canadiens 2 leading Bruins 0. The home team from Boston are coming hard, however. Brendan Gallagher a standout here, skin of Cupid, feisty like the shaggiest little bantam slugger, he\u2019s having a red hot go with a giant man, Zdeno Ch\u00e1ra. Five on five again as the Canadiens return to their full complement. And here they come, Montreal Canadiens, like cricket\u2019s Mumbai Indians except quite a lot not like that. BREAKAWAY! BUT TUUKKA RASK SAVES, he\u2019s a ripper, Tuukka Rask. Morrow shoots again for Boston, just misses. men scrap on the boards, against the glass. Boston is back in this, at least in terms of having a go at the goal. There\u2019s Raymond Gallagher, missing a tooth, he wouldn\u2019t be Robinson Crusoe in this man\u2019s National Hockey League, I will give you the tip. Slapshot! And Canadiens Condon is forced to make a fast-twitching one-handed save. OH! OFF THE POST, and the Bruins are attacking like black and yellow killer beers, I mean bees, bees with beers, these Bruins, they\u2019re down 2-nil they need some goal action. Hot shot by Joe Morrow and Condon makes an easy save. Right. Canadiens still owning this fixture, they\u2019ve had 21 shots on goal to the Bruins 9, which is many more less. Players coming on, coming off, there are four \u201clines\u201d of players who play in \u201cshifts\u201d. Ads on the box for snow-blowers and tyres that don\u2019t skid on the ice, incongruous in this Hemisphere given I type wearing my preference for jimmy-jams - a pair of sauce-stained footy shorts - at 6:56am on January 2nd. The world is an increasingly rich tapestry, people. And we\u2019re back from another break, as Weisse heads off because he copped a puck in the hand which would have hurt quite a lot given it\u2019s made of snap-frozen vulcanised rubber, effectively a rubber bullet or mortar grenade. Good times. Okay - Bruins on the attack in the Power Play, but Canadiens desperately clear the hot little black piece of pre-frozen vulcanised rubber. Slapshot! Great save by Condon the Canadien. Bruins come again, sluicing up the rink, all action in their black kit with yellow trim. What is a Bruin, anyway? Some sort of bear? We may never know. We do know because the internet says that since 1924 these two teams have played each other 909 times, more than any other two teams. No wonder they hate each other, they\u2019ve been whacking each other with sticks for 90 years. Bruins ice the puck. Men being banged into the boards. There\u2019s a hook ... which you\u2019re not allowed to do. And the Bruins have a power play because a Canadien must spend a short period in the naughty chair, where \u201cYou feel shame\u201d, according to one of the many crackerjack quotes from the best film of its generation, Slapshot. Haven\u2019t seen it? Do yourself a favour and check it out. Top film. Okay - Canadiens bombing away again, there\u2019s a huge ruck in the Bruins goal and a Bruins man has to go off for being bad. Bruins scrapping hard, four men on five ... Rask, busy. And there\u2019s a breakout by the Bruins, two-on-two ... nothign doing, but it\u2019s now 5-on-5 again ... and you sense these home town Boston Boomtown rats need to conjure the next goal, lest the Canadiens run off with this Winter Classic. No argument: Tuukka Rask! Is the man\u2019s name, he\u2019s only my favourite player ever. And we\u2019re back and zipping about. OH! GOOALLL! AND IT\u2019S THE CANADIENS IN AGAIN, IT\u2019S BEEN BOMBS AWAY ALL GAME AND NO.41 PAUL BYRON HAS THE GOAL, HE WHACKED IT IN AFTER THE PUCK WAS AGAIN HOOKED HIGH TOWARDS THE GOAL, AND EVEN THE GREAT TUUKKA RASK can\u2019t stop it. Two-blot Montreal, they\u2019re owning these Bruins, owning them like Donny Trump owns stuff made of gold. Okay, we\u2019re back for the second period, and it\u2019s puck down ... and we\u2019re away. Super physical immediately, and competitive, the sticks chop at the puck like Benny Hana on a cucumber ... Slapshot! Canadiens taking up where they left off, attacking like many ninja. But Rask holds firm, the Bruins\u2019 best. Doug Tilly asks perhaps the person least qualified in the entire world, \u201cBy any chance did you catch which player\u2019s stick was the 1st broken one of the game? We have a bet riding on this one.\u201d Anyone? Bueller? Anyone? In the meantime, local meteorologist Sarah Wroblewski says: Slapshot! No - a fake one. Slapshot! Yes - and Tuuku Rask makes another save. Fighting? Sort of wrestling. Power play\u2019s over. Vision from the net cam filled up with Tuuku\u2019s heavily-padded backside. And there\u2019s the first period done and dusted. And it\u2019s without question been the Canadiens on top, they\u2019ve shot the puck at the net many more times, and are skating with greater alacrity. Okay - we\u2019ll take a very short break here in the Manly Vale man-cave, Sydney, Australia, entirely other Hemisphere. Don Cherry\u2019s on the telly. Back with you in good time. Canadiens owning this fixture, they\u2019ve had 12 shots on goal to two. The puck - made of galvanised rubber, they\u2019re frozen before the game so they don\u2019t bounce too much - is shooting about, and the players are going at it. And ... well, there\u2019s the odd call for icing, which is shooting the puck too far up the rink. Shot! Bruins attack, and make the Canadiens goal-tender make a couple of saves. Fans in the crowd, dressed in winter ski-ware, many beanies. And the Canadiens come again, and Tuuku Rask makes another save, he\u2019s been busy, our Tuuku. And the Canadiens have a power player because Bruins No.54 got hit in the chest with a flying puck. Seems you can\u2019t do that. Okay, great puffs of white ice fluffing into the air. Men scrap for the puck with the intensity of seagulls fighting for a French Fry, armed with giant whacking sticks. There\u2019s some pushing and suchforth. Men skate off, men skate on. Puck is shooting around at very high speeds, even warp speeds, you wouldn\u2019t want to wear it in the teeth, this much is certain. Good times: Righto, still the Canadiens cometh and Tuuku Rask is \u201cswimming\u201d out to get the puck. He does the splits then gets out on his belly to get the puck. Desperate action. Sticks whacking away like people fighting over a french fry with huge chopsticks. Two men in naughty chairs, off for fighting. High speed and physical action. The puck isn\u2019t even a blur, it\u2019s invisible. Naughty boys back on the ice. Players swapping off and on. Some huge men out here, like bouncers on ice, wearing boots with little guillotines on the sole, you would not mess with them. Canadiens, nominally on top ... well, they\u2019re leading 1-nil so they\u2019re actually on top too but they appear to have had the best of this fixture thus far. Certainly Bruins custodian Tuuku Rask, part-jungle cat, part man, has been the busier goal-tender. Ha! Vison on the TV, THE REFEREE IS BLEEDING FROM THE FACE, oh my. Old fights on vintage footage. Tremendous. Okay - we\u2019re back in the thick of it. Puck down and Daniel Carr takes on Tuuku Rask who makes another fast-flinching save, the man has the reflexes of a jaguar, perhaps, or a snow leopard. Okay - beautiful day here in Foxboro, Massachusetts. We\u2019re having a break for ... something. A TV timeout. Players gots to be paid. And the puck is down, and we\u2019re away again. AND THERE\u2019S SOME FIGHTING ... two men, the goal scorer Desharnais ... a pair of bantam weights. No47 Krug was into him, shoving him quite roughly ... and they\u2019re both off the field, in respective naughty chairs. Ha. Don\u2019t go changin, National Hockey League. Here cometh the Canadiens. Power play. But Bruins attack! Crowd gets jiggy. Penalty? No. Tuuku Rask keeping his team in this. Plenty action on the boards. Maxy Talbot\u2019s back from his two-minute break. And with 12 minutes left in the first period one thing is clear: it\u2019s quite hard to call a game of ice hockey by typing it. Okay, puck skidding around. Physical action. Puck shoots over the glass. There\u2019s a penalty. No.25 Talbot is off to the naughty box for a couple of minutes. It\u2019s Canadiens with five men playing Bruins with four. Plus the goal-keeper. Not many men. David Desharnais is credited with the goal. Here come the Bruins. Sliding around. There\u2019s a broken stick. Another call for icing. These teams have been playing for 90 years. GOOOOOAL! IT\u2019S MONTREAL CANADIENS 1-NIL AFTER NO.51 SLOTS ONE HOME, HE HOOKED IT IN THERE IN THE AIR AND THE PUCK SORT OF SCRAPPILY FELL OVER THE LINE AFTER DESHARNAIS REEFED IT IN. Okay, mass sticking, skating ... the puck is skidding about, invisible, the players doing their thing. There\u2019s a call for \u201cicing\u201d which is when you shoot the puck from end to end, you can\u2019t do that. Bruins working their way up. Ice looks perfect. TO ON ONE! HE SHOOTS, HE MISSES, because our man Tuuku Rask, my favourite ever hockey player, rips off a cracking one-glove save. Top stuff. Okay. Minutes, seconds even until face-off, drop the puck ... Mike Condon in goal for the Canadiens in place of Harry Price, last year\u2019s MVP ... and we are ... YES! WE ARE GO. And here\u2019s Jordan Smith, who won American Idol, or something, and ... oh? Big voice, Oh say can you see by the dawn\u2019s early light? You can, and it\u2019s Jordan Smith, filling the screen. Huge flag. Tuuku Rask, a goal-keeper and wearer of a cracking helmet. When he\u2019s hot he can win you games single-handedly, apparently. A huge fighter jet roars over the top just as Jordan reaches the zenith of the cracking anthem of these United States of America, and it\u2019s true: The joint is ready to rumble. Okay - here come the players. Heralded by men with giant trombones. Other men in patriot kit, and muskets. Here come the Bruins. Men shoot muskets. Conductor man leading the Boston Pop, the music people. It\u2019s the latest Star Wars theme music. Players walk between them. Great gussets of flame shoot out geyser things, like in Texas oil fields. And here\u2019s the military, carrying many flags. And all rise for the Canadian national anthem, sung by a poor man\u2019s Marky Mark. Cool rendition, like Green Day ripping it out. Guitars, drums. It\u2019s quite cool. Oh Canada? You betcha. This is good: Okay, Don Cherry, a Legend, having a chat on the television. Vision of players turning up in suits, quite natty. There\u2019s a man in a purple suit and cowboy hat. Another looks like he\u2019s about to get on a fancy big boat. And here comes the pre-match pageantry. Musical types. Hipsters in those skinny jeans normal people can\u2019t get above their calves. They\u2019re called American Authors and they\u2019ve got an Enya sort of African thing going on, lot of I-yi-yiiis, possibly a banjo-mandolin. Pony tails. Johnny Depp beards. Hopefully when they\u2019re done both teams scream out of the tunnel and clean them up, en masse. Righto. Welcome back to Foxboro, Massachusetts, The People, we\u2019re moments away from the start of Winter Classic 2016, live and frozen-sweaty here at Gillette Stadium. I\u2019m Matt Cleary in a man cave in Manly Vale, Sydney, Australia, with an actual Canadian, my man Tronty (Canucks fans) who\u2019ll be flinging me random tidbits given my Hockey Knowledge extends to several viewings of the crackerjack film Slapshot which starred Paul Newman, Strother Martin and Jerry Houser as \u201cDave \u2018Killer\u2019 Carson\u201d. It also featured \u201cThe Hanson Brothers\u201d who were long-haired homicidal madmen who\u2019d wear foil in their gloves the better to punch people with. One of the great films of our time. But it\u2019s about the extent of my knowledge of ice hockey. I did see a game once, live, in 1991, in Washington DC and remember one man didn\u2019t wear a helmet because he was a veteran and there was respect for him, he was not to be roughed up, a nicety which did not extend to another man who was knocked out cold when he was rammed into a wall, an act which instigated a mighty all-in brawl which featured all the players, and reserve players, and coaches, and gear stewards, just about everybody, fighting on ice, whacking away at each other with giant sticks. It was tremendous entertainment. Then a man in the crowd hopped up on a bollard or something and began dancing so he could get on Sportscenter or whatever, the silly moo, and security kicked him out. There\u2019ll be none of that frippery here, fellow. Fighting good, dancing bad, it says so on your ticket. Okay! Not long now until anthems and puck off and, presumably, quite a lot of fighting and quick-stick whack-action. So settle in over your digital device and zap us anything that comes to mind via Twitter @journomatcleary (#BackOutdoors #WinterClassic) or email: matt.cleary@theguardian.com. Foxboro, Massachusetts, is ready to rumble. How good\u2019s this from Tim Thompson @b0undless: Greetings, The People, and welcome to Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Massachusetts, for the Big One: The 2016 Winter Classic of ice hockey in this man\u2019s National Hockey League. It\u2019s Boston Bruins versus Montreal Canadiens, traditional arch-rivals, a high-speed monster mash of whack-action on ice. And it should be really quite good. Looks a chilly enough day here in Foxboro, Massachusetts, about 41F, which is important given the town - 22 miles south of downtown Boston - is hosting a game played upon frozen water. When it\u2019s not stage for huge men in Freddy Kruger fright-masks wearing boots packing razor-sharp daggers tearing about a frozen pond waving giant whacking sticks at one another, Gillette Stadium is home of the New England Patriots (NFL), the New England Revolution (Major League Soccer), the UMass Minutemen (could be anything, Wikipedia says athletics) and the Boston Cannons which is not a crack squad of competitive Civil War re-enactors but rather a lacrosse team, the sport which is Canada\u2019s national sport, you\u2019d think it was ice hockey but it\u2019s not it\u2019s lacrosse). So there you go. Okay! I\u2019m Matt Cleary calling the fixture from deep within a mate\u2019s man cave in Manly Vale in Sydney in Australia which is deep within the Southern Hemisphere and a long way from Foxboro, Massachusetts I can give you the tip. Indeed if you ran a skewer through a globe from Sydney it\u2019d pop out the other side in waters due north of Puerto Rico. Consequently it\u2019s stupid-early here (4:30am) on this dark side of the moon. It\u2019s also January 2nd. Good times. Okay, we\u2019re T-minus not-long-now until start, and would love to hear your thoughts on this fixture, particularly given my own knowledge of ice hockey extends not far past watching the crackerjack film Slapshot. So do zap us anything that comes to mind on the Twitter @journomatcleary (#BackOutdoors #WinterClassic) or email: matt.cleary@theguardian.com. We\u2019re thirty minutes from puck off, puck down, whatever quick-stick\u2019n hot puck action begins these high-paced, big-whacking affairs of the ice. And we will talk again soon. Matt will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s what Bruins goaltender Tuuka Rask will be wearing today:"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
