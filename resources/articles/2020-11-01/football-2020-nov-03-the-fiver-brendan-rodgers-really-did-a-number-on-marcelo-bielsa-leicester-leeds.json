Our wispy-bearded try-hard cousin is in a catatonic state right now. He\u2019s had one hell of a shock to the system, you see, his entire worldview unravelling completely and spectacularly on Monday night as Brendan Rodgers took Marcelo Bielsa to school. Brendan Rodgers! Hipster Fiver hasn\u2019t been this distressed since discovering the B-side of his 672g vinyl copy of A Love Supreme is a mispress, with Baby Shark where Part 3: Pursuance should be, and Part 4: Psalm replaced by Agadoo (Version). Hipster Fiver feels like crying. He\u2019s already been pee pee. Eleven times. Brenny really did a number on Bielsa, though, going on Sky Sports before kick-off and explaining exactly what he was planning, laying out his intentions in plain sight, effectively asking Leeds what they were going to do about it. \u201cTeams normally press in a zone, theirs is very much man to man \u2026 so there will be lots of space on the field. I would say we have the best counterattacking player in the league in Jamie Vardy, so I hope that\u2019s something we can exploit. But it will be a tough game.\u201d Only the last sentence proved woefully wrong, as Leicester swanned to a 4-1 victory, and could quite feasibly have scored twice as many. Let\u2019s face it, if Bielsa had pulled off such a brassy stunt, we\u2019d never hear the end of it from the hipsterati. Thank you, Brendan. Thank you. At least we know Rodgers won\u2019t totally lose the run of himself. \u201cI thought we were tactically brilliant,\u201d he told Sky in the immediate aftermath, that pronoun doing an awful lot of work there. \u201cI thought we were amazing \u2026 I\u2019m really pleased with our flexibility \u2026 we\u2019ve had brilliant performances \u2026 I\u2019m delighted.\u201d To be fair, having added the sainted Bielsa to a list of early-season conquests that also includes Pep Guardiola and Mikel Arteta, Rodgers should be allowed to bask in his own managerial genius and contemplate a genuine title tilt. Even if his team did get beat three at home by a David Moyes side, a fate that\u2019s never fallen Bielsa yet. We\u2019re glad that Hipster Fiver, currently trying to unpack spiritual guidance from \u201cpush pineapple grind coffee\u201d, still has one or two of the old certainties left to cling on to.

FIVER LETTER \u201cIn a recent article on another website, talking about the recent incidents of players \u2018diving\u2019 to win penalties, Tony Cascarino says that he doesn\u2019t want to be seen as a dinosaur or a \u2018Cascasaurus\u2019 and it wouldn\u2019t have happened in his day, etc. Which got me thinking about other footballer/dinosaur combinations and, while I\u2019m sure other readers can come up with some good ones, I\u2019ll start with the obvious Gunnersaurus and the fact that Raheem Sterling self-admittedly runs like a T rex\u201d \u2013 Mark Jones.
