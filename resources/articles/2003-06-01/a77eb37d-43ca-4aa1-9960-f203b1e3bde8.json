Although the chancellor today ruled out joining the euro for at least another year, detailed plans on the changeover have been drafted as part of the government's \"prepare and decide\" policy. In the national changeover plan, published today, the Treasury said \"E-day\" would be on April 6 of whichever year the UK decided to join. Under the plan, the pound could be phased out within three years of the decision being made. After observing the performance of the other 12 nations that joined European Monetary Union on January 1 2002, it was decided that there should be only a two-month dual currency period in the UK. The Treasury has also revised the number of coins it would have to mint from between 13-14.5 billion - as estimated in the last changeover plan of March 2002 - to 10 billion. Two billion notes would be printed. The latest document said: \"The government has developed, and progressively refined, an outline timetable and the logistics which would be necessary for a changeover in the UK. \"The UK has had the opportunity to learn from the euro area countries and has built these lessons to its planning. One of the key lessons was that a phased approach to a changeover would help minimise costs, operational risks and the overall length of a changeover.\" Four months after a government decision that conditions were right, a referendum would be held and 20 months later euro financial services would be available electronically. Ten months after that would come E-day, and two months from then the pound would cease to be legal tender. The report went on: \"Maintaining consumer confidence would be an essential part of a successful changeover. The government's objectives would be to provide the necessary help to consumers while avoiding unnecessary burdens on business.\" This help would include consumer codes of practice, with businesses pledging to display accurate conversion rates, dual pricing and to train staff. Bank accounts would gradually be converted from sterling to euros, with the process beginning at the point when electronic euros were introduced to the UK. \"Citizens or businesses whose accounts had been converted would receive relevant information in both sterling and euro on their statements,\" the report said. The UK's 3.8 million businesses would have to change their computer systems and working practices to accommodate the new currency. They would have to assess any impact on contracts, banking, accounting rules, tax and electronic payments. The changeover would pose a \"significant challenge\" to the financial services sector, although the fact that the euro is already used in electronic form on wholesale financial markets could offset some of the problems. The report suggested that if the UK were to join EMU at the same time as Sweden and Denmark \"there might need to be a co-ordination on timing of some key milestones\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
