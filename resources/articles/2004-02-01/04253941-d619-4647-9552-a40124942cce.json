Flying Bed, in a room with distorted floor and wonky walls, would have been too disorientating. Padded Cell, all opulent green leather, seemed just a bit too near the bone to spend the night in. The joke in Freedom - with bunk bed, a broken hole in one wall, bricks and a pick lying nearby - might wear thin. So we chose Grandma's: from its appearance on the website, it seemed more manageable somehow, with bed on the floor and traditional antique furniture. Its only oddity was \"a bathroom in the wardrobe\". The sign over the entrance to Propeller Island City Lodge, in a grey-fronted apartment block off the lower end of Kurfurstendamm, says \"Living in a Work of Art\". It becomes quickly apparent when you enter the fantasy world of your choice, that it is more than a gimmick. Behind this enterprise is an artist fiercely protective of his creation. On the exit to the staircase - fashioned out of a beautiful, golden-brown reclaimed door - is an anguished exhortation: \"Handle this handmade work of art with wariness and respect.\" On the table in our room is a laminated notice from the artist/director: \"Please! It was an immense amount of work to create this little island\", followed by a request to be clean and careful of the artwork: \"The City Lodge is a small private odyssey without the financial power for extensive repairs.\" Each room has a user's manual, a fat compendium of instructions on the care of that particular room, a map and history of the hotel - and a catalogue of music. For one of the first things you notice, when you get over the quirkiness of the surroundings, is that though there is no television or mini-bar, there is a six-channel sound system, all carrying \"sonic sculptures\" by Lars Stroschen, owner of the hotel. (Propeller Island is the name of his studio.) \"Commercial radio stations, news announcers and the latest chart listings are strictly off limits here,\" says the user's guide. Instead, \"music and tone collages\" have been created, from synthesiser music. But the piece de resistance is channel five, l'abstracte expressioniste : \"Feeds very well with hotel's main idea. Needs concentration. Unusual and for open minds only.\" Now there's a challenge. But Grandma's, as promised, was \"toasty-cozy\". Two cushioned wicker chairs were set by the circular table. The fine wooden bed was comfortable and endowed with fluffy towels, each bearing a chocolate. The matching three-door wardrobe was huge - it needed to be, as one door led into the shower (a delightfully powerful one emerging from a striking array of copper pipes), the other into the toilet. The walls were (news)papered with the classified ads sections of Zweite Hand, January 2000. Overlooking all was a portrait of a fine grey-haired woman with white-collared black dress and quizzical expression. It turned out that she was Stroschen's grandmother, and it was her furniture in the room. Stroschen opened three rooms for guests in 1997. The first was Castle Room, where the bed is in a toy fortress with fantastical landscapes on the walls. When he got the chance to extend, taking over the rather basic hotel that was already there, he went on to design Two Lions, with huge cages for sleeping in; Upside-down Room, where the comfy-looking bed along with table and chairs and standard lamp are attached stalactite-style to the red-and-black-tiled ceiling: trapdoors in the floor reveal the real beds and seats with individual reading lights; and Mirror Room, a small diamond-shaped room with angled mirrors set over a bed with black satin sheets and purple towels. There are 31 rooms now (the half being the tiny Dwarves' Room). \"Some rooms are not suitable for everyone,\" says Stroschen, with masterly understatement. Valentina, one of Lars' morning helpers, served us a vast breakfast, including assorted meats and cheese on a great white platter, in the breakfast room with its wall-length panels of tropical flowers and appropriate soundtrack. Idiosyncratic though this hotel is, it is not unusual in its emphasis on art. Berlin has several hotels that display the work of artists from Art'otel in Mitte, which is filled with the work of leading contemporary painter Georg Baselitz, and Kunstlerheim Luise in Luisenstrasse whose 33 rooms are each individually designed and decorated by different artists, to the six-room Pension mitArt, associated with an art gallery and full of artworks. This fits in totally with the new atmosphere of Berlin which, we remembered from our long-ago visits, had a solidity and solemnity about it that has been cast off in the frenetic splurge of architectural rearrangement engaged in during the last decade. There is a light-heartedness about the new art in public places, such as the characteristic comic-style red and blue interconnected figures of Keith Harings and the metallic blue Balloon Flower of Jeff Koons. They are part of a sculpture trail in the new Daimler Chrysler quarter, its giant glass buildings soaring neck-crickingly to the sky, and where - more than anywhere else in Berlin - one gets the impression of internationally famous architects strutting their stuff. Here is a pattern book of different eye-opening styles, such as the giant three-storey mall of Richard Rogers' Arkaden and the exotic tent-like canopy of the Sony Centre, lights and colours continually changing and reflecting in the glass buildings around, long tablets of blue light set into the paving, transporting one into a film set. But the architects are at it all over Berlin, from Norman Foster's magnificent glass and mirrored dome atop the Reichstag, to the hugely imaginative spaces of the Jewish museum, a piece of the Holloway Road in Berlin (Daniel Liebeskind also built the recently completed extension to the London Metropolitan University). But in other nooks there are less flashy tributes. On a grassy lawn across the bridge from Museum Island (where we had hoped to see the Pergamon Altar - splendid in its bare isolation when we last saw it in 1978, but now swathed with scaffolding, as was the Market Gate of Miletus: a symbol of the continuing evolution of Berlin's renovation) was a deceptive row of red spades and a bucket or two. It looked, in the dusk, as though it might be there for a fire-fighting purpose, but its intent was aesthetic. Another artistic highlight was tea at the reconstructed Hotel Adlon (anywhere that has a different picture in each loo surely deserves inclusion). And just as artistic in its edible way was the food hall in KaDeWe, the largest in Europe: a labyrinth of carefully displayed goods, myriad (400) different breads, a mosaic of fruit, a mountain of exotic teas - and a dozen or more eating counters and wine bars. There was, early on a Saturday evening, a terrific sense of animation, perhaps because KaDeWe has recently thrown off the shackles of restrictive opening hours and is now open until 8pm. It was obviously the place to be on a Saturday night. Our chosen meal in the fish section counted as entertainment, too, as we watched the theatre of chefs at work. On our last evening, we stopped for hot chocolate at the hectic Cafe Schaubahne, part of the experimental theatre round the corner from our hotel, its facade festooned with a banner: \"I think human beings and fish can co-exist peacefully\" (George Bush). Returning to Propeller Island afterwards was like a retreat to a - rather odd - womb. On the floor of the reception area was a pattern of thin metal rods, with an admonitory sign not to touch. It was Lars Stroschen's last piece of design - a three-dimensional version of the Propeller Island symbol to be displayed in a showcase. \"But that is the last thing I do. I need to get back to my music.\" On March 4, he is holding an official opening party and then, his hotel in the care of a manager, he will become a musician again.
