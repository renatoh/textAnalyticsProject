Don't worry: it's only for three days, broadcasting from the Abbey Road studios, and overseen by savvy production company Somethin' Else. You can listen via showstudio.com or at 87.7FM in London, and it's really rather good. Yesterday's launch programmes, kicking off with 6Music's Queens of Noize, were a bit boomy, and interviews with bands sounded as if they were being conducted down a very deep well. But the Queens were eclectic in their music choices, and likably lively. Naomi Campbell was due on at 1pm. It will come a massive shock to hear that she was an hour late, even though the item was pre-recorded. This segment was unintentionally hilarious, with Campbell listing her favourite tunes in a late-night, breathy voice. Somebody had plucked up the nerve to ask what she likes to hear when travelling (\"depends on my mood\"), and also what she'd like played at her funeral. She wants Aretha Franklin's Natural Woman, with \"everyone up in their seats dancing\" and also, she added, \"22 doves\". Bless. Tomorrow's lineup includes Bella Freud, Lily Cole, Stella McCartney and, um, Miss Piggy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
