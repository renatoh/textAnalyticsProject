That obviously didn\u2019t work out. Her opener tonight, I\u2019ve Got to Use My Imagination, refers to \u201creasons to keep on keepin\u2019 on\u201d. A superb cover of Luther Vandross\u2019s Never Too Much allows her to yell: \u201cI just don\u2019t want to stop.\u201d And why should she? At 75, she may be less nimble on her feet than she used to be, but she looks fantastic and her voice still justifies her nickname: the empress of soul. An astonishing 58 years after Every Beat of My Heart hit the US charts (the singer performing as part of Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips with her brother and cousins, who have all retired), she is still clearly having fun, telling her euphoric audience: \u201cWe\u2019ve been hanging out for, errrr \u2026 many, many years\u201d to ripples of laughter. Moments later, she quips, \u201cI feel it coming on. Be careful not to hurt yourself.\u201d Come on it does, with 70s soul hits (Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me, Baby Don\u2019t Change Your Mind) piling into contemporary dips (Sam Smith\u2019s Stay With Me) and songs from her disco and Motown eras. She reminds people that the Pips were the first to record I Heard It Through the Grapevine, in 1967 \u2013 \u201cand then Marvin Gaye stole it the following year\u201d. It\u2019s banter, not bitterness. Gaye was \u201can amazing man\u201d. By now, the tales are coming too, of her shy friend Curtis Mayfield (who called her \u201cGlads\u201d) and the losses of her friends and peers, Aretha Franklin and Whitney Houston. In a touching aside, she reveals that performing enables her to relive an amazing life. The 1989 Bond theme Licence to Kill shows off her incredible lower register, and she seems teary when an emotional, particularly nostalgic The Way We Were receives a singalong and standing ovation. \u201cI could stay here all night, but I\u2019ve got to get to the train station,\u201d she quips, introducing her signature smash, Midnight Train to Georgia. After 90 minutes, she\u2019s still note perfect and pointedly declares: \u201cUntil we meet again \u2026\u201d At First Direct Arena, Leeds, on Sunday. Then touring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
