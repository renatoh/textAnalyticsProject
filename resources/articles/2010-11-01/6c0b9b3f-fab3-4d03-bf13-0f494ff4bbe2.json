A phrase first coined in the jazz age, used by F Scott Fitzgerald in This Side of Paradise, it was suggestive of limitless possibility, of adversity being merely a bump in the road towards glory. Today, it's fair to say, the word is more readily associated with the announcement of a 12-date university tour by Blancmange. Let it not be said though, that comebacks have never brought us great music. Actually, there were a fair few on the RR thread who said precisely that. I hope this week's playlist might counter such accusations, but if the music does not, then maybe the biographical back story will. There's that guy Elvis, for example. The outmoded greaser and star of Clambake almost delivered a 90-minute performance of carols for his 1968 Christmas special. The format, mercifully, was changed and \"Elvis\" became known as \"The 68 Comeback Special\". If I Can Dream was written especially to close the show. As a late-60s plea for world peace it rivals All You Need is Love. As inspirational comeback stories go, that of the octogenarian Cuban musicians, the Buena Vista Social Club, reunited after generations of enforced purdah, is so good they made a movie out of it. The film and the soundtrack enjoyed global success. That can't all be ascribed to anti-Castro sentiment, I suspect, and Chan Chan is their anthem. Tina Turner's album Private Dancer not only saw her return to prominence after a period of obscurity, it made her one of the biggest stars in the world. What's Love Got to Do With It was the biggest hit, and presaged the later revelation of her abusive relationship with former husband, Ike. Little Richard's Bama Lama Bama Loo was a return to rock'n'roll after a (brief) period of abstinence in favour of devotional music. This year, Losing Sleep is Edwyn Collins's first recording since his rehabilitation from a brain haemorrhage. In tone it's typical of his output \u2013 driving and upbeat \u2013 but the lyrics speak of debilitation and loss, and the vocals bear the scars of Collins's trauma. So we have returns to prominence, but also returns to form. The Walker Brothers had been away for a decade when they released No Regrets in 1975. It flopped. As did their next album, and the one after that. But that third album did herald a marked change in direction, from harmonies to disharmony. It was a new mood that would inspire Scott Walker's later, sonically ambitious solo albums, and The Electrician is a perfectly disquieting example of this. With its pummelling, industrial beat, Machine Gun both announced Portishead's return and shot apart the band's unfortunate reputation as purveyors of dinner-party trip hop. Roxy Music's Manifesto signalled the band's renewed appetite after four years apart in the late 70s, but it too showcased a different sound: low slung rhythms, dub undertones and multifarious sonic effects. LL Cool J, finally, coined the definitive phrase about comebacks by declaring that his comeback should not be called a comeback. To make sure the phrase stuck, he uttered it over a vocal sample of what sounds like satanic monks. This week's playlist: 1. If I Can Dream - Elvis Presley 2. Chan Chan - Buena Vista Social Club 3.
