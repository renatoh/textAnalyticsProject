Bruce has strengthened his forward line with the signing of Dwight Yorke from Blackburn Rovers. The reality for Morrison is that with \u00a36.25m England international Emile Heskey, Mikael Forssell and now Yorke in the Birmingham squad, he has effectively dropped down the pecking order to fourth choice. A loan deal would mean that the 25-year-old Morrison would have to drop into the Coca-Cola Championship because with the transfer window closed, he is not allowed to join another Premiership club until it re-opens in January. Morrison said: \"All I can keep doing is playing well for my country when selected and give Steve a problem. But I know between now and France next month [October 9] I need to get some matches under my belt because that is going to be a big game.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
