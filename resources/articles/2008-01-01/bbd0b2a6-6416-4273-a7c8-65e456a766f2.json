It was launched in June to confront some of the challenges we are facing in inner cities by applying critical lessons learned by Archbishop Desmond Tutu through the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in South Africa. What is the aim of the foundation? To tackle violent gang culture by transforming gang leaders and their existing and potential followers into agents for positive change. We believe that the voice of disaffected youth must be heard and that this is the first step in a process whereby youth leadership can be redirected and young lives can be reclaimed. Where did the inspiration for the foundation come from? From Tutu's role in helping to prevent bloodshed on a vast scale when the South African apartheid regime ended. This showed that the principles of truth and reconciliation can achieve real change. What is your role in the foundation? As the director, I focus on making the foundation strategic. We work in partnership with groups that are already known to be having an impact at the grassroots level. Who is getting involved? The Community Foundation Network, the Prince's Trust, VSO and the YMCA are just a few of the organisations we are teaming up with. We also work with the police, prison officers and community officers who come into contact with gang members on a regular basis, to promote the approaches and interventions that work. How does the foundation \"transform\" gang leaders? We help young people to recognise the unique value of every human being, whatever their race, religion, culture or orientation. Young people will only find the hope of transformation when our whole society stops demonising those who have little sense of being part of that family, and who consequently go looking for it elsewhere and find it in a gang. Are there particular management challenges to meeting your goals? As a small and new foundation, the greatest challenge is ensuring our contribution to the debate is as far reaching as possible while at the same time not growing to duplicate existing work. What is the best advice you have been given that will help you in this role? Keep the vision of what you want to achieve before you at all times. Give an example of a management no-no. Disrespecting or losing sight of the unique value of each member of staff and/ or volunteer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
