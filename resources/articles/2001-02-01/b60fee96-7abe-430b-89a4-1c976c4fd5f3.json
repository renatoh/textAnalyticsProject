Cartier-Bresson has objected to a book of photographs of him by the American David Douglas Duncan, entitled Faceless. They are mediocre, \"snapshots\" rather than true portraits, he protests. But it can't be just the quality of the pictures that has upset him. Duncan too is a famous photographer, whose images of the Korean war are classics. He was able to photograph Cartier-Bresson casually, over drinks at the Musee Picasso in Paris, because Cartier-Bres son was on assignment to photograph him. The fact is, the world's most revered photographer hates having his picture taken. He's not alone. Who doesn't have a fear of the camera's power to tell us what we are? From posing for our first school photo, we learn the oppressiveness of the camera, its power to define us. Think of poor Marilyn Monroe, going through the contact sheets of her photo sessions, crossing out shots she didn't like. Artists, who understand the authority of visual experience, are not less but more mystical about the power of the image. Cartier-Bresson at least allows some images of himself to circulate. Stanley Kubrick, who began as a photojournalist, be came such a stranger to snappers that an impersonator was able to pass himself off as the director despite looking nothing like him. And who can say what part was played in the disintegration of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's marriage by their decision to play a married couple to Kubrick's searching camera in Eyes Wide Shut? The camera seemed to capture a lack of physical passion in their scenes together, and a falseness in the marriage that has now collapsed. Yet Kubrick did allow one person to portray him - his wife. Christiane Kubrick, an artist, painted Kubrick and showed his portrait in exhibitions in St Albans. Kubrick clearly only trusted images that were made with love. The same is true of Cartier-Bresson. He is happy with the photographs taken of him by his wife, Martine Franck. Similarly, it's hard to imagine the American painter Georgia O'Keeffe posing semi-nude in a series of portraits had the photographer, Alfred Stieglitz, not also been her lover. Other artists have had a more troubled relationship with the one-eyed intruder. Jackson Pollock's fame was established by Arnold Newman and Hans Namuth's photos of him brooding in front of his canvases or throwing paint. But when Namuth persuaded him also to be filmed at work, Pollock felt exposed. He ended the session by falling spectacularly off the wagon (he'd been dry for a few highly productive years), turning over the dinner table and shouting: \"I'm not the phony, you're the phony.\" Artists seem to divide, just like the rest of us, into clumsy introverts, terrified of the camera, and people who love - and are loved by - the lens. I doubt whether Salvador Dali ever objected to having his picture taken. He even let Helmut Newton photograph him with a tube in his nose in his last days, a miserable figure of futile wealth and sterile fame. Picasso was a happy subject and adept media performer: Cartier-Bresson caught him in a fearful moment in wartime, Duncan shot the artist in the bath. But other kinds of portrayal caused Picasso pain he was horrified when Francoise Gilot published an account of their relationship. Images didn't bother him words did. Duncan points out in his defence of Cartier-Bresson that he is celebrated for snatching \"the decisive moment\", photographing people unawares. But I don't think that's adequate. Cartier-Bresson is not a pitiless snapper. If he has a personal fear of the lens, he has tried to soften its assault on others. His pictures of artists in particular - Matisse, Bonnard, Picasso - are richly artful celebrations \"portraits\", he would say, rather than \"snapshots\". His portrait of Matisse, taken in 1944, catches the artist sketching in a room full of pet birds, one of which he holds Matisse has been photographed spontaneously, yet the image Cartier-Bresson has selected from the many he took that day is an allegory of Matisse as creator, his imagination soaring. None of the birds is in a cage. Cartier-Bresson complains that, rather than choose one significant portrait, Duncan has published an entire reel of film. He sees an opposition between the use of the camera to make a sensitive work of art and the routine photography that dominates our lives: arbitrary, crude in its definition of who we are and - in his eyes - violent. \u00b7 Faceless by David Duncan is published by Assouline."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
