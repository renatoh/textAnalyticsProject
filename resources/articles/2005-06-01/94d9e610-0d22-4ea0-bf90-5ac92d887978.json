Mars has them too. On March 7 2004, the cameras on Spirit, the Mars Rover exploration vehicle, captured a curious bright streak in the Martian sky. But Franck Selsis, from the Centre de Recherche Astronomique de Lyon, and colleagues disclose in this week's Nature that this was likely to be a shooting star caused by a meteorite burning up as it entered Mars's atmosphere. Further calculations show that this was probably part of a regular display. \"The timing and orientation of this streak, and the shape of its light curve, are consistent with the existence of a regular meteor shower associated with the comet Wiseman-Skiff,\" says Selsis. They believe that Wiseman-Skiff could produce a meteor shower every March on Mars, like the autumn Leonids which flash thought the night sky on Earth every November. Mars has a carbon dioxide rich atmosphere, thought to be similar to the early Earth's atmosphere. Now the scientists are hoping to learn more about the evolution of Earth's atmosphere by watching more Martian shooting stars."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
