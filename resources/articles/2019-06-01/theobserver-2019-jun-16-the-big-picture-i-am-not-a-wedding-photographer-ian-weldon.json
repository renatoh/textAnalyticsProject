His documentary approach, in contrast to the highly staged and unnatural style of traditional wedding photography, shows the real character of the big day, with humour and honesty. \u201cI\u2019m going there with absolutely no preconceived idea of what I think I should be photographing,\u201d he says. From last-minute dress ironing to dad dancing, every image is born of genuine spontaneity and his photographs are never calculated: \u201cThat\u2019s what comes out at the end of the process; it\u2019s somewhat expressionist,\u201d he says. Weldon, who was born in Durham and now lives in Newcastle, has been a photographer for 15 years. About seven years ago, he started photographing weddings to earn extra money to work on personal projects. Influenced by the ideas of Martin Parr, Bruce Gilden, and William Eggleston, he now photographs weddings all over the world, from backyards in County Durham to Hollywood mansions; now his work is to go on show in a Bristol gallery. This photograph was taken about two years ago. Weldon was getting ready to take a traditional group picture, something he rarely does, at the request of the bride and groom. The group was setting up and waiting for an elderly relative. They had been on their feet all day and had not had a chance to eat anything. So when a waiter walked past with a tray of canapes, the whole party went for it. \u201cIt\u2019s the epitome of what I am trying to do with all my photographs,\u2019\u2019 says Weldon. \u201cIt\u2019s that serious situation that is juxtaposed with a ridiculous aspect at the same time.\u201d I Am Not a Wedding Photographer by Ian Weldon is at the Martin Parr Foundation, Bristol, from 26 June to 10 August. The book is out later this month (RRB Photobooks,\u00a324)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
