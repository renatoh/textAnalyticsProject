One guy said: \u2018All respect to Australia, but a decent club side would beat them.\u2019 So I don\u2019t think there is too much for them to worry about. We will prepare every day like we are going to play our best game on Saturday and go from there.\u201d Naturally, when Australia and England meet these days, thoughts turn to the battle of wits between Cheika and Eddie Jones, his old mate from Randwick. Cheika did his best to insist, as ever, that there was nothing in it. \u201cIt is irrelevant. It is Australia versus England, that\u2019s all that counts. It is not about \u2018fun\u2019 with Eddie. We will have fun on our own in camp, and then we will prepare ourselves each day the best we can.\u201d For Wales, the misery of that 13th defeat in a row to opponents they must face again in the pool stages of the World Cup in two years\u2019 time was compounded by the likelihood Jonathan Davies\u2019s autumn is over. \u201cIt looks like an ankle injury,\u201d Warren Gatland said. \u201cHe\u2019s just being strapped up and is on crutches. It doesn\u2019t look brilliant, but we\u2019ll know more in the next 24 hours.\u201d To lose a player of such experience from Wales\u2019s new-look midfield would be a terrible blow but Gatland was pleased with how the three players making their home debuts played, as well as the blooding of three new caps from the bench. He rued the controversial try with which Australia took their lead out to 13 at the start of the final quarter while Wales were pressing to retake the lead. Nevertheless, he was not of a mind to make anything of it. \u201cIf Kurtley Beale hadn\u2019t scored that freakish try, there was a good chance we could have won the game. I haven\u2019t had a look at [the knock-on]. Sometimes those decisions go for you. It\u2019s one of those things. I\u2019m not going to dwell on that.\u201d A run of 13 like that might be enough to disturb some. Wales, though, are adamant there is no mental block for them when it comes to playing Australia. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d said their captain, Alun Wyn Jones. \u201cWe showed our attacking approach in spades out there. We need to work on the balance of how, when and where we do that. We don\u2019t want to be doing it in our own 22, because if you give teams like that too much time in your 22 they\u2019ll take those gifts and keep the pressure on. I definitely wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a mental block, because we\u2019ve come too close for it to be that. \u201cWe probably should have [won]. We\u2019ve got to stay confident and keep playing this way.\u201d On Saturday, a win against Georgia is non-negotiable, before attention turns to the All Blacks. Their record against them, of course, is even worse."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
