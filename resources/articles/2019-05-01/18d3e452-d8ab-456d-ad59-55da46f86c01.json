Liverpool\u2019s 3-2 win at Newcastle United on Saturday evening put J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team two points ahead of City with Wolves left to visit Anfield on Sunday. If City beat Leicester they will take a one-point advantage to Brighton for their final match. If Pep Guardiola\u2019s men fail to win on Monday the hope of becoming the first team since Manchester United a decade ago to retain the title would be thwarted if Liverpool take three points on Sunday. Guardiola may be without Fernandinho for the visit of Brendan Rodgers\u2019 side. The midfielder will undergo a fitness test on a knee injury, while Kevin De Bruyne is definitely unavailable because of a hamstring problem. Even if City were to falter and miss out on the title, Guardiola counts the 192 points his team have so far taken since the start of last season as his proudest achievement, saying the Premier League is the \u201ctoughest\u201d competition he has managed in. When in charge of Barcelona, Guardiola won an unprecedented treble of La Liga, Champions League and Copa del Rey in the 2008-09 season. He then retained the league title for the following two years and claimed a second European Cup in 2011. At Bayern Munich he again won three Bundesliga titles in a row, between 2013 and 2016. Yet asked if his points tally in England gives him the most satisfaction, Guardiola said: \u201cYeah, it\u2019s the toughest league I\u2019ve ever played as a manager, for the quality of the rivals \u2013 no doubts. That\u2019s why being there [in contention] is incredible. But of course only one will take the prize and the other one will be at home sad.\u201d Reflecting on the season-long tussle between his team and Liverpool, Guardiola said City\u2019s current position is \u201cone of the biggest achievements\u201d. He added: \u201cWe have to win to give more credit to it, of course. I would not say that 100 points [of last year] was bad and that we are not satisfied. But at the same time, we were seven points behind [in late December this season]. Then, you can say: \u2018It\u2019s done \u2013 we did it last season.\u2019 But we did the opposite of that. We were like [chipping away at] a stone.\u201d Guardiola outlined how he gauges his team\u2019s achievements. \u201cYou give credit for the titles and how huge our rival is. In my career as a manager, I played against incredible sides,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are two that were \u2018wow\u2019. One is the Barcelona of Luis Enrique\u2019s [who won the treble in 2014-15], with Neymar, [Lionel] Messi and [Luis] Su\u00e1rez in front. \u201cThe other is this Liverpool. I think they\u2019re the best two sides I\u2019ve faced. That\u2019s why being there, with the title in our hands, fighting against them until the end [is so impressive].\u201d He pointed to the leadership and character throughout his squad, citing how City responded to being knocked out of the Champions League by Tottenham Hotspur on away goals by beating them in the league in their next match. \u201cIt\u2019s much better to have a lot of leaders than just one. They have to have it in their heads and feet,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they showed me against Tottenham was incredible, two and a half days later, 12.30 on Saturday, the sunshine, humidity. Then, in the next two matches, winning at Old Trafford [against Manchester United] and Burnley, where everyone thought we\u2019d drop points.\u201d City, having already won the League Cup, could claim an unprecedented domestic treble should they retain the title this coming week and beat Watford in the FA Cup final on 18 May. Guardiola has guided his team this far despite injuries to key players, including De Bruyne and Benjamin Mendy, both of whom have been unavailable for the majority of this campaign. \u201cLast season was incredible,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this season we have fought against an incredible team that has everything.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
