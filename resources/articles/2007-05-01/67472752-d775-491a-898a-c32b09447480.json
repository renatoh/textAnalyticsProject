We are having trouble because the prices are being pushed up to a ridiculous level, sometimes \u00a330,000 more than the asking price, and are snapped up extremely quickly. We are both in our 40s and working, and have two houses to sell in the region of \u00a3190,000, yet it seems almost as difficult for us to find somewhere as it is for a first-time buyer, unless we are willing to take out a mortgage that will be financially punishing on a house we may resent paying such an inflated price for. Would it make financial sense to rent for a year or are there any other options for us? We are tied to the Cambridge area. EB A If you are looking to buy in an area of Cambridge where other buyers are prepared to pay what you consider to be silly money, it seems to me you either have to swallow your resentment and accept that that is the price you have to pay, or lower your sights regarding the size or location of your Cambridge home. But whichever way you choose to deal with the price issue I think renting for a while might be a good idea. Assuming you need to sell your current properties in order to raise the cash to put towards a new property, selling them first before finding a new place to buy will enable you to move more quickly and so make you more attractive to sellers. Not being part of a chain also gives you more negotiating power and you may find that having cash to put down immediately has a beneficial effect on the price you'll have to pay."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
