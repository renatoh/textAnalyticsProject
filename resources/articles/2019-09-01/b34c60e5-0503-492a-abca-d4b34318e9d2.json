Twenty years ago, his dad, Fe\u2019ao, and his brother, Elisi, were part of the Tonga side who played England at Twickenham and two decades on Billy picks up the torch. Vunipola junior was a spectator that day, making his first trip to Twickenham aged six, hand in hand with his brother Mako. Tonga also played against Leicester at Welford Road on that tour, as well as the All Blacks \u2013 including Jonah Lomu \u2013 in Bristol. It was England\u2019s home ground, however, that resonated most. \u201cIt was such a surreal time for me and my brother as we had just got off the plane straight into a World Cup, we were just taking it in our stride, following my dad around to Twickenham,\u201d said Vunipola, who was due to be named overnight in England\u2019s starting XV. \u201cI remember Twickenham being like a spaceship, it was so big compared to anything we had ever seen coming from Tonga.\u201d Suffice to say they are expecting quite the crowd at the Vunipola household in the Tongan village of Longolongo. There may be split loyalties around the country but not at the house where Vunipola\u2019s grandmother and aunt live. \u201c[Their] house is a point where they go to watch the games together as a celebration,\u201d Vunipola said. \u201cWhenever we are playing, whether that is at home for England or for my club, they will all be watching and supporting and messaging me or my wife, so I will know about it if they are watching because they think it is all down to them that we are winning. I am excited to see what type of support we can garner this weekend.\u201d Vunipola is forthright when he says he is Tongan but equally so when he explains how much he wants England to win on Sunday. Unsurprisingly he expects Sunday to be different to anything he has experienced in an England shirt. \u201cI am Tongan, my parents are and my grandparents are so it will be very emotional just as much as anything else. I have to get my head right and my body right, be the best prepared I can be.\u201d Vunipola also agrees with England\u2019s attack coach, Scott Wisemantel, who urged the Rugby Football Union this week to consider touring the Pacific Islands. \u201cI would love for that to happen,\u201d Vunipola said. \u201cJust from my point of view as us, as England, it would probably be the most unique experience we would ever get to experience because everything in Tonga is probably the same as it was in 1888. That is the way we love it and it is amazing. I would love for us to go there as it would encourage more people to take up the game and give people more opportunities like it has given me.\u201d Twenty years ago Tonga did not enjoy the best of afternoons, going down to a 101-10 defeat. Vunipola does not intend to ask for his dad\u2019s advice but not so much because of the scoreline that day. \u201cI know because I have had the same mentality,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have a lot of pride, they are prideful people. You can just go back through the history \u2013 Tonga has never been colonised and that is probably drip-fed down through to my dad and me. I know that my dad thinks they could have beaten England. \u201cThat is just the way they are and that helps me a lot to prepare for games because I put myself in position that I am second best and I am always trying to be the best. They will say all week that we don\u2019t respect them, but we do. We respect them a lot, but that gets them going \u2013 hopefully we show them more than enough respect in terms of how we play.\u201d Meanwhile, England\u2019s defence coach, John Mitchell, has urged Vunipola and co to fight fire with fire on Sunday. Tonga are expected to provide a physical challenge but Mitchell believes that can be England\u2019s strength with Joe Cokanasiga and Manu Tuilagi also set to be named in the starting XV. \u201cIt is something we embrace and we really enjoy,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to our players as Englishmen, playing in that white jersey, to have that presence. It really is important to us. We have to realise that we need to be smart with it as well. \u201cI think the game will have huge intensity at the start as you\u2019d expect. Then there will come a point when the game opens up. \u201cWe like to be physical but we can also move around pretty quickly as well, but we have to earn that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
