Some migrant workers \u2013 many from Bangladesh, Nepal and Indonesia \u2013 said recruiters had promised wages twice what the Malaysian factories paid them. Some complained their companies had them sleep 28 to a single bedbug-infested room while sharing one toilet. But in an unusual twist, when the investigators for Transparentem, a New York-based non-profit that investigates labor and environmental abuses, uncovered these problems, it didn\u2019t rush to publicize them and shame those factories\u2019 western customers, which included Target, Nike and Fruit of the Loom. Instead, Transparentem\u2019s founder, Benjamin Skinner, adopted an unorthodox strategy: reaching out privately at first. Transparentem\u2019s leaders had seen in the past that when investigators uncovered horrible conditions in Asia, the embarrassed western customers often hurried to terminate their relationship with the suppliers and then did little to fix the abuses. So when Transparentum uncovers serious problems, instead of rushing to publicize them and spotlight those factories\u2019 western customers, the group quietly informs those companies and asks them to work with the factories to fix the problems. Behind this is the knowledge that Transparentem will disclose its investigative findings and how companies responded \u2013 and western companies know they will look bad if they don\u2019t act. Transparentem presented its findings on the Malaysian apparel factories to 23 western companies, and 15 of them agreed to help remediate the five factories: Honsin Apparel, Whitex Garments, Perindustrian Shunhon, SP Garments and Knit Textile Manufacturing. The western companies got four of the factories to stop using recruiters who demanded illegal fees. They also got them to repay nearly $1.8m in recruitment fees to more than 2,500 workers. Transparentem said SP Garments didn\u2019t respond to its findings. In an important victory for Transparentem, soon after it sent its Malaysia report to companies last October, the American Apparel and Footwear Association \u2013 which includes Nike, Gap, Ralph Lauren and 120 other companies \u2013 announced a new policy on \u201cresponsible recruitment\u201d that requires \u201csupply chain partners\u201d to make sure no workers pay recruitment fees and \u201cworkers retain control of their travel documents and have full freedom of movement\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s the traditional name-and-shame model \u2013 the tradition that you expose as soon as you have the evidence,\u201d said Skinner, who used to work as a journalist whose focus was investigating human trafficking. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to take a blowtorch to the apparel industry. We\u2019re trying to say to brands you have a real responsibility here. You have real power here. We want to give you a real opportunity to use that power when you\u2019re under intense pressure to stop doing business with a supplier that has problems. We want to give brands a grace period that gives them an opportunity to do the right thing.\u201d The International Labor Organization says that Malaysia has up to 4 million migrant workers, representing 20% to 30% of the nation\u2019s workforce. In 2017, Malaysia exported $3.6bn in textiles and apparel, with the United States Department of Labor placing Malaysia-made garments on its list of goods produced with forced labor. Skinner said Transparentem decided to investigate Malaysia\u2019s apparel industry because other investigations had already uncovered forced labor in its electronics industry and its palm oil industry. Transparentem found the recruitment fees for the Malaysian factories ranged from $745 to $4,356. Many migrants said they borrowed from banks or relatives, mortgaged land or sold their homes or livestock to pay the fees. Transparentem wrote: \u201cSome workers said it took years for them to repay loans, placing them at risk of debt bondage.\u201d Some factories gave passports back to workers only if workers first put down a deposit of three months\u2019 pay. \u201cThe company fears that we will run away if we get to keep our passports,\u201d one worker said. Sixty percent of the workers Transparentem interviewed said recruiters had deceived them about their future pay and the nature of the work promised. Transparentem praised two athletic wear companies, Brooks Sports and Tracksmith, for their role at Perindustrian, where some workers said recruitment fees were so high it took two years to pay off any loans. Brooks paid a portion of the costs to reimburse Perindustrian\u2019s workers even though it had stopped buying from those companies. Tracksmith, a customer of Perindustrian at the time of Transparentem\u2019s investigation, also contributed to the reimbursements. Transparentem\u2019s report said: \u201cDespite having no authorized sourcing relationship with Perindustrian Shuhan, Brooks Sports took a leadership role in organizing buyers\u201d to fix the factory\u2019s problems and reimburse workers. Dan Sheridan, Brooks\u2019 chief operating officer, said: \u201cAfter Transparentem\u2019s work revealed unacceptable findings in a factory which was not authorized to produce our product, we took action to improve conditions for workers there.\u201d Sheridan added. \u201cIt is our hope that this investigation can be a catalyst for change, not only in Malaysia, but for any country that receives foreign migrant labor.\u201d Transparentem also praised Primark and Target, noting that even though they had stopped sourcing from the Whitex factory, those two companies took leadership roles in assuring improvements there, including illegal recruitment fees and retaining passports. Primark commissioned an audit of the factory, and both helped make sure Whitex ended recruitment fees and stopped withholding passports. Transparentem wrote that Nike had helped address recruitment fees and other problems at the Honsin factory, but it faulted Nike for not doing more at SP Garments and its Hing Yiap factory, which a Nike sublicensee had used. Nike insisted that it didn\u2019t even use any of SP\u2019s factories and that the sublicensee used the Hing Yiap without its authorization or knowledge. Nonetheless Nike said it had approached SP\u2019s owner about making improvements. Cimarron Nix, Nike\u2019s director of labor, sustainable manufacturing and sourcing, said Nike had identified the problems at the Honsin factory months before Transparentem did. Nix said: \u201cWe have no relations with SP Garments\u201d and \u201cwe are not in a position to have legal or other leverage.\u201d \u201cWe are deeply engaged in respecting human rights across our supply chain,\u201d Nix continued. \u201cIt is a journey of continuous improvement.\u201d But Skinner asked why Nike was still using Malaysian factories, like Honsin \u2013 where workers had to pay recruitment fees and where passports were confiscated \u2013 a decade after a 2008 expos\u00e9 found that Nike was using a Malaysian factory that withheld passports, had illegal recruiting fees and had horrid housing conditions. Transparentem\u2019s report also criticized Variety Wholesalers \u2013 the retailing chain is headed by Art Pope the North Carolina multimillionaire and politician \u2013 for doing little to fix problems at Whitex, from which it had ordered garments through a middleman. Templeton Blackburn, Variety Wholesalers\u2019 general counsel, said Variety has never purchased goods from Whitex, but did buy \u201ca very limited amount of goods from a New York vendor\u201d. Variety said it didn\u2019t \u201cdecline\u201d to participate in remediation efforts, but had worked with its vendor and Transparentem to correct problems. Transparentem also criticized Wolverine Worldwide, a footwear manufacturing based in Rockford, Michigan, saying that company should discuss with Perindustrian how it could do more to support reimbursement and that Wolverine \u201cshould assess whether its auditing\u201d procedures \u201care thorough enough to detect suppliers\u2019 risks of using forced labor\u201d. Wolverine responded that it takes \u201callegations of human rights violations\u201d very seriously and said the factory has passed a \u201crigorous third-party audit\u201d that didn\u2019t find forced labor or other violations \u201cclaimed by Transparentem\u201d. Wolverine says it was waiting for Transparentem to report back on audits before it took additional action."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
