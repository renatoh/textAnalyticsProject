Yeah, yeah, I know, security holes. Yeah, yeah, web keeps changing. Who needs new features? Everyone said, \"You have to get Firefox 2.0.\" I said, \"Why?\" And they said ... well, I'm not exactly sure what they said. But one day after it seemed everyone else was using it I downloaded and installed Firefox 2. And something like three weeks later I uninstalled it again in a fit of frustration. I could do this because I am a pack rat and unable to throw anything away, which means that safely stowed in my download directory was my old copy of Firefox 1.5.07, which has otherwise vanished from the official Mozilla site. I don't know what happens on other people's machines, but on my machine every time I tried to download anything with Firefox 2 it would freeze until the download was finished. If someone wants to tell me the problem was a recently downloaded extension or something, I have only one extension installed (Tab Mix Plus). Nor do I want to hear about my browsing habits. (\"You are about to close 98 tabs,\" it warned me the other day. \"Are you sure you want to continue?\") The older version of Firefox doesn't have this problem, and looking around the Net I see I'm not the only one whining about version 2. Is software bloat an inevitable consequence of increasing age and success? Is there no software developer who can ever say, \"You know, it's good the way it is?\" I do have software that doesn't suffer from this problem. And to a program they are all things that were last \"improved\" in 1995. People think programming has made progress, but the telnet client (for logging in to remote machines), FTP client (for file transfers), Usenet reader (for newsgroups), and personal information manager (hey, it syncs with a Palm) all still do what they said on the tin. If I didn't have editors screaming at me because I couldn't track the changes in their fancy-schmancy post-2000 versions of Word correctly, I'd still be word processing back in 1995, too. I mean, what's changed? I put words in a row. I could do that in SuperScripsit on the TRS-80 Model III in 1981. To be fair, Firefox is overall some improvement over its precedessor, in that routinely, once a day, that either crashed or had to be restarted, and my installation of Firefox only needs that sort of bullying once every few weeks. But compared to the error-free days of 1993, when I used the lovely pre-Netscape browser Cello, life is not better. And it is true that some problems are due to memory leaks in Firefox extensions - in fact, you can download a Firefox extension to keep track of which extensions are leaking memory.
