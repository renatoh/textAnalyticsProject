No matter that the thumb on his right hand - his throwing hand - is fractured and started the week black and swollen. No matter that the announcement of the Wales team to play Scotland on Sunday was put back 24 hours so he could prove his fitness. For the first time in 10 months Mefin is happy. He has survived \"full-on\" scrummaging and lineout sessions and the medics have pronounced. Davies is about to win his 28th cap. More importantly he has a new contract in his pocket and by the time Wales line up for what is expected to be the grand slam decider against Ireland in eight days, he could be a father. Angharad, his wife, is due to give birth on the Thursday before the match. \"If I think of how things are now and how they were last summer there can't be a better situation,\" says Davies. It was then that he thought he might have to give up rugby. The Welsh Rugby Union had pulled the plug on the Celtic Warriors and Davies was the biggest loser: he heard the news the day after his stag night in Galway. He was the first-choice Wales hooker but suddenly he did not have a club. \"We were going for European qualification and the last match was Connacht away, which we won. They were exciting times, then when we came back we were told. I was about to get married and all of a sudden I had no job. What made it worse was that we were about to go on tour and I knew that if I played and got injured I wasn't worth nothing to nobody.\" The 32-year-old who started with Carmarthen Quins before moving to Dunvant, Neath and Pontypridd, spent most of the summer training on his own - \"but training for what? I didn't know. I didn't have a team, I didn't have a club.\" Stade Fran\u00e7ais wanted him \"but the crunch question was whether I would give up international rugby. I could understand the club's perspective but that wasn't for me. However, every other club was sorted and it was upsetting.\" He went back to working part time as an electrical engineer, playing for Neath in the Welsh Premiership. The top hooker in the land was earning \u00a39,000 a year from rugby because even though the Ospreys added him to their squad for the Heineken Cup and the Celtic League there was still no contract, just plenty of playing. \"There was one weekend I remember really well. I was involved against the Scottish Borders [for the Ospreys] on Friday night - I got on for the second half - and then travelled back on Saturday morning and played for Neath against Pontypridd.\" However, he has no beef with Neath. \"They were as good to me as they could be; I think we were good for each other. But I couldn't rely on it for the rest of my rugby life. It could have gone either way, I could have gone right down. It was hard but I had to be strong. I never gave up.\" Not even when he was dropped for the first of Wales's autumn internationals, against South Africa, and told he had not played enough quality rugby. Davies returned for the Tests against Romania, New Zealand and Japan, playing alongside men earning 10 times as much as him. However, the absurdity of his situation had not gone unnoticed. Gloucester, who had suffered bad injuries to two hookers, offered a short-term contract and, despite late overtures from the Ospreys, Davies accepted. This week, despite another offer from the Ospreys, Kingsholm extended his contract for a further two years. \"I'm just amazed we got him,\" says Dean Ryan, the Gloucester coach. \"He's a complete footballer. Mef is an old fashioned hooker - very good at his job - but once he's done his stuff in the tight or the lineout he doubles up as an extra flanker. \"He was hugely responsible for the win over England, has played for Wales right through the Six Nations and, on top of that, he's a great bloke. Everyone likes him. I don't understand how he slipped through [the WRU's] fingers.\" Davies, who still lives in Pontypridd but intends moving further east - \"but not out of Wales, oh no\", prefers not to talk about the WRU and wants to concentrate instead on playing in front of Gloucester's fanatical fans. \"I wasn't sure after the summer how I felt about rugby. But I'm over the moon with it, something that has come very late in my rugby career. \"For the first time I've got faith. You only have to walk around the club, see the support, see how strong it is. It's like an international every week so if you can't get inspired or motivated there are questions to be asked. \"Gloucester realise players are important. It's given me a fresh start. I play games with new guys with new ideas and different values. And it's got to be good for Wales. I'm playing a higher standard of rugby and they're not paying for it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
