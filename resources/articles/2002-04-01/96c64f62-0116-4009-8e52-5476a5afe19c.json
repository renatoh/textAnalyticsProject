Although a deal is far from guaranteed, the administrators, Deloitte &amp; Touche, are expected to be in talks with the league this weekend. A new, and probably final, offer could be presented. Harris met with Carlton's chief executive, Gerry Murphy, and Granada's chairman, Charles Allen, at the central London offices of the administrators yesterday morning. Although sources close to the talks insist the meeting was not called to try to thrash out a deal, the fact that the two sides were prepared to sit down and talk together points to a softening of the belligerent stance both have taken since the television companies warned that they would pull the plug on ITV Digital unless its contract with the league was torn up. The administrator, Nick Dargan, told both sides that unless a new broadcasting deal was reached by early next week he would be forced to try to sell the business. If no buyer could then be found, ITV Digital would be closed, he said. Sources say the meeting was positive in several ways. They believe that the league is now prepared to negotiate directly with the administrator, making a deal more likely. Harris had previously insisted on direct talks with Carlton and Granada. The attendance of Allen and Murphy, although under the guise that they were merely two potential creditors if ITV Digital does go bust, suggests that the television firms are keen to resolve the issue. \"This was not a negotiating meeting but it shows the people involved are taking a slightly more mature approach to a dispute on which thousands of people's livelihoods depend,\" said the source. If the league fails to agree a deal and ITV Digital reneges on its contract, the broadcasting rights would revert back to the clubs. The BBC and Channel 5 are seen as front runners to ensure this season's play-offs are aired but the money they might offer the league is likely to be far less than it receives at the moment. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
