The inference that it was Apple's only sizeable software project is not true. Apple's software roster is more extensive than Microsoft's. Let's start with Quicktime, a constantly upgraded cross-platform multimedia application. There are the movie industry standards such as the huge and complex Shake. There's also Final Cut Pro &amp; Express, Motion, Logic Pro, Aperture, Soundtrack Pro, DVD Studio Pro and FileMaker Pro. Phew! Then there is iTunes, GarageBand, iPhoto, Mail, iMovie, iDVD, Pages, Keynote, iWeb, AddressBook, iCal, Safari, FontBook, iChatAV and OS X Server. With the exception of the standout Microsoft Office - which was written for the Mac platform - I cannot bring to mind any other industry-leading applications that Microsoft produces. Microsoft's days of hegemony are coming to an end. Good riddance to bad software, I say. Charlie Fellowes Brooklyn, NY Stick to what you do best I remember being astounded at mycokemusic.com's poor usability and excessive use of Flash. Simple is always better - hence iTunes's growing success. I also had to laugh at the draconian platform restrictions applied to the site. No Firefox or Mac user will ever be able to access it. Maybe Coke should stick to what it does best: fizzy drinks. Ijaz Akram London It's good not to talk I thought I was the only one who hated voicemail (Technobile, June 22). Well said! Shakif Hussain London \u00b7 There have been several attempts to make access to content more efficient but almost none ended up in the marketplace. I spent more than three years working on speech-to-text for voicemail and on automatic summarisation of the text generated automatically. A summary and review of the state of the art is at http://tinyurl.com/qmmsf. Costis Koumpis Twickenham \u00b7 Charles Arthur asked about a speech to text convertor. Spinvox, a British startup, has an excellent one. Chris Huggett (and others)\u00b7Gerrards Cross When in roam Kate Bulkley (Revolutionary calling, June 22) has little understanding of mobile roaming, or of the Rebtel service. Roaming charges arise from taking a mobile outside the range of its own operator, thereby relying on a different company's network. Despite Bulkley's claims of Rebtel eliminating roaming fees, it has nothing to do with roaming but is concerned with international calls made from within, not without, the \"home country\". John Walters Bexhill [Kate Bulkley writes: You can avoid roaming using Rebtel now if you get a local Sim card in the country you are roaming to. But it's true this isn't avoiding roaming per se; just becoming a \"local\" mobile user. Avoiding roaming charges using Rebtel will only work once Wi-Fi-enabled handsets become common - Rebtel's plan for next year.] Album art lives on I noticed on the MC Lars website that album cover art of a sort still lives on in digital form - Aim buddy icons and wallpaper for mobiles. Not quite the same perhaps, but signs that art for the musical masses will live on. http://style.nmylife.com/blog Cheaper way to charge There is a cheaper version of the SynCh device (Gadgets, June 22) - multi-mains plug and only drives a USB socket - from Proporta, which I believed would charge my third-generation iPod. I found out the hard way that only fourth-generation iPods charge via USB. The same will be true of the SynCh device, and, unlike Proporta, they tell you this on the site.
