Research shows that nanoparticles, the ultrafine powders produced by the nanotechnology industry, can build up in the brain if they are inhaled. The study, which was carried out on rats, was designed to investigate what might happen if nanoparticles were released into the atmosphere, either as a slow trickle of industrial pollution, or as a catastrophic leak from a nanotechnology production plant. Because the particles are so fine, they could remain in the atmosphere for some time. The researchers found that once tiny carbon nanoparticles were inhaled, they accumulated not only in the lungs, but found their way to parts of the brain. Although the rats appeared to be unaffected by the particles, scientists believe they could ultimately lead to brain damage. \"We should certainly care about this,\" said Professor Gunter Oberdorster at the University of Rochester in New York, who led the study. \"It's too early to be alarmed, because we don't yet know what the particles might do in humans. We shouldn't stop working with them, we should just look for what adverse effects these particles might cause,\" he said. The report is due to appear in the journal Inhalation Toxicology. Nanotechnology deals with material on the scale of a few billionths of a metre, or 80,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair. Nanoparticles are among the most common materials to come out of the new science, being used in anything from sun block to car bumpers. Only small quantities of nanoparticles are currently produced in Britain. The first production plant dedicated to making nanoparticles, owned by the defence research company Qinetiq in Farnborough, Hampshire was switched on last summer and is capable of producing a few kilos of material an hour. But it is a growing industry which is expected to be worth billions within a decade. Scientists fear that the more companies start producing nanoparticles, the greater the risk they may get into the atmosphere where they could be inhaled. Some nanoparticles are already widespread in the air we breathe, largely due to the burning of fossil fuels and vehicle exhaust fumes. In a busy street, each breath we take contains around 25m nanoparticles. Scientists already suspect that nanoparticles from diesel fumes exacerbate heart disease, asthma and other respiratory diseases. What concerns them now is that new types of nanoparticles could cause unexpected health problems. \"This is the first documented evidence that an innocent particle like carbon, if it's small enough, can find its way into the brain,\" said Professor Ken Donaldson, a toxicologist at Edinburgh University. \"The worry would be if the nanotechnology business designs nanoparticles which are fundamentally different from the ones which we are already exposed to, and seem to cope with reasonably well. If very different nanoparticles are manufactured, there's a concern that they might have a different effect in the body.\" Another unpublished study by Prof Oberdorster's team has found that the nanoparticles travel into the brain after getting stuck in the nasal cavity. Preliminary tests on rats have also shown that the areas of the brain where the nanoparticles get lodged become inflamed. While Prof Oberdorster says it is too early to confirm how much damage, if any, the inflammation causes, at least some damage is likely. \"Your sense of smell could be affected, or more seriously, if these particles travel further into the brain and get to more sensitive regions, they could cause damage,\" he said. Scientists cautioned that the finding did not warrant a moratorium on nanotechnology. Next week scientists are due to gather in Daresbury, Cheshire, to discuss the health implications of nanoparticles at a conference by the Institute of Physics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
