They now dominate their respective markets but analysts, burned first time round by unwarranted faith in dotcoms, are still wary. They worry that eBay shares are trading at 70 times earnings, suggesting that they're still heavily over-valued, and that Amazon still isn't making a profit, despite hundreds of millions of pounds of investment. But as senior executives of the companies pointed out last week, both businesses are still in their relative infancy. Given the hold they've already exerted over web users on both sides of the Atlantic, their current good tidings should be only the start. \u00b7 Buried among the latest results for 4 Ventures, the commercial arm of Channel 4, was the encouraging news that its interactive division is doing rather well. Although the division as a whole, home of E4 and Film Four, lost \u00a328m, interactive quadrupled its revenues to \u00a37m in 2002. Much, no doubt, was due to the voting frenzy that surrounded Big Brother. But with the umpteenth series of the show on the way and text messaging voting having been added to the paid-for website and interactive TV service last year, Diary wonders if there are any fresh innovations left to introduce. \u00b7 In the less than fascinating, but highly lucrative, world of pay for placement search engines, rumours continue to abound that E-Spotting, one of the most successful examples, is up for sale. The Brick Lane-based success story, which allows advertisers to bid on key words with affiliated search engines, has expanded rapidly in the space of the past three years and recently launched a renewed foray into Europe. But insiders say that with the industry becoming ever more lucrative, bigger suitors for the company are queuing up but waiting to see whether it retains its contract with portal giant Yahoo! before making a bid. \u00b7 The latest charts from the big search sites always make for interesting reading and again prove that folks are using the web for much more than porn and gambling (but not much more). Unsurprisingly, war-based search terms feature heavily. Refreshingly, news-based searches seem to be diluting our seemingly never-ending obsession with celebrity. According to MSN's latest monthly chart of the most searched-for terms, Sars, the WHO, the Foreign Office and Saddam Hussein have pushed out the likes of David Beckham, Kylie, J-Lo and Eminem. \"While in more normal times soaps and stars are search staples, they're quickly replaced by hard news issues and serious concerns in difficult times,\" reckons MSN marketing chief Tracy Blacher. A likely story, says Diary. \u00b7 Owen Gibson is new media editor of media-theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
