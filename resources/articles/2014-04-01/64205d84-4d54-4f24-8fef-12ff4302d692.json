Since then, if not earlier (for the Roar moved seven points clear back in round 13), Mike Mulvey\u2019s men have had the luxury of playing with a safety net they built themselves; that generous points gap that allowed them to climb up to the trapeze and captivate the arena with their death-defying somersaults, leaps and assorted tricks, knowing all the while that a slip or a miscalculation wouldn\u2019t end up with someone shovelling up their remains and hosing down the stains as the punters filed out, hands over their childrens\u2019 eyes. But it\u2019s semi-final time now and the safety net is gone. How will the Roar respond to sudden-death football, especially knowing a loss will significantly undermine their excellent season (for in Australia, champions take precedence over premiers)? And what about the question that always pops up at this time of year (a question almost as old as the oldest question in human history: \u201cHave you seen my keys?\u201d)? That is, \u201cWill the week off be a help or a hindrance?\u201d. No doubt the Roar will come into this game fresh, with all their stars on board, but Melbourne Victory have been playing on the edge for weeks now, both at home and in the Asian Champions League, and at the same time they\u2019ve risen to the challenge, earning important results. Melbourne will hope their tough run home has given them enough momentum to get past the deserved favourites. Champions League hangovers Speaking of the ACL, Melbourne Victory, the Western Sydney Wanderers, and the Central Coast Mariners all played Champions League games midweek, with Victory and the Mariners doing so in Korea and Japan respectively. All three have been squeezing in these games - with their significant road trips - since late February. Despite the physical strain this has created on individual players and their respective squads, all three teams have coped admirably. While it\u2019s impossible to say how these teams would have fared in the A-League without these supplementary jaunts, in A-League matches immediately following ACL games, the Victory have won two, drawn one and lost two, the Wanderers have won one, drawn two, and lost one, while the Mariners, as enigmatic as a badger in pince-nez and a jauntily-worn fedora, have won four, losing just once. But will the extra workload finally catch up with any of these teams - especially the Mariners who only touched down in Sydney on Friday morning - once the blowtorch of semi-final football starts to lick at their undercarriage, especially if extra-time is called for, as is often the case in finals? Can the Mariners be party poopers again? The story of the 2012-13 season was the remarkable rise of the Wanderers, the team that tapped the zeitgeist, whipped up chest-baring passion from the suburban, red-roofed tundra of western Sydney, and rode a wave all the way to the premiers\u2019 plate and the grand final. But instead of their fairytale ending in \u2018happily ever after\u2019, the always unfashionable, but ever confounding, Mariners rewrote the script and, underpinned by a solid defence and a better game plan, went and won the cherished toilet seat. (That they created their own fairytale - three-time bridesmaids finally getting hitched - was an equally good narrative somewhat overshadowed at the time.) This year the two teams meet a week earlier and again the Wanderers (who have 10 players from last year\u2019s grand final starting XI playing on Saturday night, to the Mariners\u2019 three) will be favourites, not least because the match will be played at Parramatta Stadium and their fans will, as ever, roar the house down and create a heaving spectacle. But never write off the Mariners. In last year\u2019s grand final, just as in last week\u2019s elimination final against Adelaide, the Mariners shepherded and contained their opponents\u2019 attacking threat while having the wherewithal to grab the goal/s needed. And for all their understandable fatigue from having to play in Japan on Wednesday night, five of their leading players were either unused subs (Nick Fitzgerald and Bernie Ibini), played minimal minutes (Mitchell Duke) or didn\u2019t make the journey at all (Nick Montgomery and Matt Simon). Tony Popovich\u2019s Wanderers will surely need to be at their best, and it might just be that the outgoing Shinji Ono, Aaron Mooy and Youssef Hersi get them over the line. But if their customarily direct style of play fails to bear fruit, they\u2019ll need a plan B. Muscat\u2019s redemption It\u2019s not that long ago there were calls for Kevin Muscat\u2019s head on a platter - and not just from opposition fans who have never forgiven him for being, well, Kevin Muscat. In particular there was that six-match sequence from late December through to late January when Victory failed to win a game, and in consecutive weeks were hammered 5-0 (away to Wellington, and home to Sydney). Muscat seemed at a loss to explain it and we wondered if he\u2019d lost the dressing room, such was the lack of fight in Victory\u2019s efforts. But since then, Victory have lost only twice in 11 A-League games including last week\u2019s elimination final, and while they seem to lack the slick synchronicity they had under Ange Postecoglou (Mitch Nichols\u2019s departure has surely played a part in that, as has the so far underwhelming impact of Tom Rogic) they are not far off it. And their hunger has returned. Win or lose on Sunday, Muscat has silenced his doubters and earned himself time. Who\u2019ll get the important goals? It\u2019s hardly been a golden year for strikers in the A-League, although some cracking goals have been scored. Consistency, or a lack of it, has been the main problem. No-one - even Adam \u2018Golden Boot\u2019 Taggart, or runner-up James Troisi, both of whose goals have come in clumps - has found the kind of irresistible form that scares defenders into wearing an extra pair of underpants into a game. But it\u2019s not too late for the strikers to make the most telling of contributions. The Roar\u2019s Besart Berisha is an obvious danger man. In a season interrupted by suspensions, he\u2019s scored 11 goals in 18 games, many of them by squirming through defences like a cornered rat towards daylight. After his many enforced breaks he\u2019ll be desperate to make amends. Troisi is another who\u2019s scored a good number of goals, and while he was most prolific early in the season, he looks like he\u2019s finishing well (pun intended), with four goals in his past six matches (if only Kosta Barbarouses could manage a better conversion rate given the chances he gets). The Mariners\u2019 Ibini is another who\u2019s come on well lately, scoring six goals in his last 11 A-League appearances. But other promising sharp-shooters, like Tomi Juric and Duke, have disappointed this year, but all that will be forgotten if they can fire their teams to victory when it counts.
