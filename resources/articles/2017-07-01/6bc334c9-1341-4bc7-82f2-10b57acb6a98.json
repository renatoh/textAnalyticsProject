It is inspired by John Tenniel\u2019s original illustrations for Alice in Wonderland, and Campbell is on set in a photographic studio in north London, surrounded by a twisted fairytale scene of mouldy jam tarts and scorched doll houses. She plays the Royal Beheader \u2013 of course she does \u2013 and is joined by Lupita Nyong\u2019o as a dormouse, Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs as Campbell\u2019s fellow beheader, South Sudanese-Australian model Duckie Thot as Alice, Whoopi Goldberg as the Royal Duchess and Sasha Lane as the March Hare. Fashion\u2019s woke poster-woman and feminist activist Adwoa Aboah has been shot as Tweedledee. And RuPaul will also appear, as the Queen of Hearts. This is a staggeringly talented and eclectic cast. It is also all black, with the calendar styled by Edward Enninful, the newly appointed editor of British Vogue, the first person of colour to have held the post. That said, the concept is the work of a white photographer, Tim Walker, who explains his motivation by saying \u201cit\u2019s never been done before. Alice has never been told like this.\u201d This is not the first time Pirelli has featured an all-black lineup \u2013 in 1987, a 16-year-old Campbell posed topless for an edition that featured only black models. This time, however, the tone is wildly different. And it feels precision-engineered to strike a chord in an era in which fashion finally seems to be addressing its diversity problem, with Enninful\u2019s appointment, the autumn/winter 2017 runway collections in just about every city featuring their most racially diverse cast ever, as well as Gucci\u2019s recent campaign that featured only black models all being presented as green shoots of change. But reflecting, even leading, cultural conversations is what the Pirelli calendar does these days, which may seem bizarre given that it is essentially a promotional exercise for tyres. This was not always the way. For much of its history the calendar, launched in 1964, was most famous as a place where supermodels took off their kit \u2013 sometimes artily \u2013 for photographers ranging from Terry Richardson to Herb Ritts. But in 2016 Pirelli commissioned Annie Leibovitz to shoot women known for their \u201cprofessional, social, cultural, sporting and artistic accomplishment\u201d, including Yoko Ono, Patti Smith, Serena Williams and Amy Schumer, without the male gaze in mind. Earlier this year, Peter Lindbergh\u2019s instalment continued in the same vein, presenting portraits of women with their clothes largely on: Uma Thurman was snapped in a rib-knit roll-neck. Both calendars inspired thinkpieces aplenty. The cynical might question Pirelli\u2019s motivations for using an all-black cast, and whether its nod to fashion\u2019s vogue for diversity is a little too on the nose. With that box ticked, will Pirelli forget about diversity for its 2019 edition? Will the rest of the fashion industry, for that matter? None of these concerns are at the fore on set, however, where models wearing vinyl skirts and platform shoes mill around to a soundtrack of Aretha Franklin\u2019s Respect and Otis Redding\u2019s (Your Love Has Lifted Me) Higher &amp; Higher. The dark detritus of fairytale is strewn about \u2013 cakes with plastic hands erupting out of them, burnt toast and a looming, giant stuffed hare that refuses to stay upright. South African Thando Hopa plays the Princess of Hearts. She is a law graduate who worked as a prosecutor specialising in sexual offence cases, and only got into modelling because she \u201cwanted to have a greater level of representation for someone who looks so different\u201d (she has albinism). Invested in the power of images \u2013 \u201cyou see someone portrayed in a particular way and it gives you inspiration and motivation\u201d \u2013 Hopa describes, laughing, her reaction to finding out that Walker planned to make this all-black Pirelli: \u201cI actually phoned him up and I was like: \u2018Let\u2019s sit down and talk.\u2019\u201d Walker laid bare his thinking: \u201cHe said \u2026 any person with a different colour should be able to see themselves in any way. So any girl, whether she is black or Chinese or Indian, they should be able to have their own fairytale. \u201cThis is an important step in culture development \u2013 to push images that aren\u2019t generic, that don\u2019t conform to stereotypes,\u201d she says. Hopa has considered the response the calendar might get, given that the fashion industry is still far from fully representative. \u201cI hope that people see the intention of this. Personally I don\u2019t find it controversial \u2026 I think people really should see the end goal and not obsess in the myopia \u2026 this is a unifying effort because now you have Alice looking differently from the way she does. Alice can be anyone.\u201d Let\u2019s hope that this year\u2019s buzzword \u2013 \u201cdiversity\u201d \u2013 keeps sounding loudly into 2018 and beyond."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
