In this big-hearted, good-natured movie treatment of \u201cthe 33\u201d and their ordeal, the media are not the villains. Neither are the politicians, not really. The bad guys would appear to be the mine\u2019s owners who neglected safety, but their iniquities are not dwelt on. This is a feelgood disaster movie. Antonio Banderas plays Mario Sep\u00falveda, the guy who becomes the trapped miners\u2019 unofficial leader in their subterranean hellhole. Clean-cut Rodrigo Santoro plays presidential aide Laurence Golborne, Juliette Binoche is borderline preposterous in the role of a miner\u2019s downtrodden sister, and Gabriel Byrne plays a mining engineer who has to get them out and does everything except say: \u201cLooks like I picked the wrong week to quit smoking!\u201d It\u2019s pretty hokey but likable, and the fantasy \u201clast supper\u201d scene is tear-jerking stuff."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
