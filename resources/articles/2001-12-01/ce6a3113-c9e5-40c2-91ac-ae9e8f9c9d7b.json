He came under immense pressure to take a politically acceptable line to resolve the tax implications of the Lloyd's insurance market crisis of the 90s. He told me and other friends at the time that he found this pressure - on a person of strong religious conviction and an upholder of civil service ethics - almost intolerable. I believe this, quite as much as his HIV diagnosis, led to his early retirement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
