Wang, 43, was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison in January for \u201csubverting state power\u201d after a closed-door trial. The prominent lawyer, who defended political activists and victims of land seizures, vanished in a sweep aimed at courtroom critics of Communist authorities known as the \u201c709\u201d clampdown because the arrests started on 9 July 2015. Wang was held incommunicado for more than 1,000 days without access to his family or a lawyer prior to his trial and authorities have repeatedly denied requests by his wife, Li Wenzu, to visit him in jail. \u201cHe is a totally changed man \u2026 he was so agitated and anxious that I couldn\u2019t even talk to him just then,\u201d Li told the South China Morning Press. \u201cMy husband\u2019s health has deteriorated during the long incarceration, he had lost so much weight,\u201d Li told AFP. \u201cWhen I asked him what he had for breakfast, he kept scratching his head. But he couldn\u2019t remember,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was really emotional. This was the first time my son and I got a chance to see him after being separated for four years.\u201d The couple\u2019s six-year-old son, Wang Guangwei, was a toddler when his father disappeared. Li saw her husband at the Linyi jail in the eastern province of Shandong, where he was transferred in May after years spent at a detention centre in Tianjin. \u201cI felt like he was not the earlier Wang Quanzhang,\u201d said his sister Wang Quanxiu, who was also at the meeting. \u201cHe was very agitated when he spoke to us. He had made a draft about what to discuss and had to constantly keep looking at his notes to remind himself of what to say,\u201d she said. Wang Quanzhang was the last of more than 200 lawyers and activists swept up in the 2015 crackdown to be tried or released. Li, who has actively protested against her husband\u2019s detention and sentencing, has repeatedly demanded proof of life from the authorities. She was placed under de facto house arrest the day before Wang\u2019s 26 December trial to prevent her from attending. Earlier that month, before Wang\u2019s court date was announced, Li and three supporters shaved their heads and tried to submit a petition to a Beijing court, protesting against his detention. In April last year, she attempted to march 60 miles to the Tianjin detention centre where Wang was previously held. This week, a video was posted on Twitter showing Li shouting over the prison wall asking whether Wang Quanzhang was alive. It was only on Thursday morning that she received a call from Shandong provincial authorities saying she would be allowed a 30-minute visit. \u201cI\u2019ve never really known if he was alive all these years, and finally there was a clear message I can meet him,\u201d Li tweeted Thursday. Authorities had also called Wang Quanxiu on Thursday at about 11 am and told her she could meet her brother at 2pm that day. \u201cI rushed to the Linyi jail as soon as I received the call, but when I got there it was already 5 pm so I missed the chance to see him that day,\u201d Wang Quanxiu said. \u201cWe have been calling the prison authorities all week to no avail, and then suddenly they changed their mind.\u201d The timing of the meeting, which coincides with the G20 summit in Japan, has led to speculation that the Chinese Communist party \u201cmight be offering a compromise\u201d to embellish China\u2019s chequered human rights record, said Chan Yue, an activist from the Human Rights Concern Group in Hong Kong. Beijing has stepped up its crackdown on civil society since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012, tightening restrictions on freedom of speech and detaining hundreds of activists and lawyers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
