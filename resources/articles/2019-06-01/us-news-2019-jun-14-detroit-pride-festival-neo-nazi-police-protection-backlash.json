Chief James Craig told reporters at a press conference this week that \u201cboth sides were wrong\u201d and repeated a similar claim to the Detroit city council, which outraged some members of the public and counter-protesters, many of whom are black. Craig told reporters: \u201cBoth groups were taunting our officers with racial epithets\u201d and counter-protesters were \u201cmasked-up and referring to our African American officers inappropriately\u201d. However, Meeko Williams, a black counter-protester, said Craig\u2019s claims were untrue. \u201cWe don\u2019t tolerate racism, and we told [officers]: \u2018You\u2019re black. The Nazis will kill you, too. They don\u2019t have any respect for African American police officers,\u2019\u201d Williams said. \u201cThey were threatening to shoot cops, calling [officers] monkeys and N-words, and my comrades were trying to get officers to break rank and turn them back against the Nazis.\u201d Craig\u2019s comments appeared to echo Donald Trump\u2019s remarks after the 2017 Charlottesville Unite the Right rally in which a far-right protester was convicted of murdering a counter-protester and injuring eight others by driving a car into a crowd. Trump said there were \u201cvery fine people\u201d on both sides. The Motor City Pride festival took place in downtown Detroit\u2019s Hart Plaza last weekend. About 15 members of the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement marched at the event. They openly carried three rifles, two handguns and other weapons, according to police. The group tore up a rainbow Pride flag and shouted racist and homophobic abuse. The neo-Nazis also made chimpanzee noises toward black people and police officers, according to multiple witnesses, while photos show one member of the group appearing to urinate on an Israeli flag. About 15 Detroit police officers formed a human barrier around the neo-Nazis and escorted them as they marched. Video shows police, some of whom were wearing rainbow Pride pins, pushing counter-protesters. In one video of the incident, a counter-protester appears to be asking officers: \u201cHow come they get protected, but we\u2019re not?\u201d The police strategy prompted accusations that they were protecting neo-Nazis instead of those attending the event and the public. When asked by reporters on Monday about the department\u2019s strategy, Craig replied: \u201cEveryone has a right to freedom of speech, but you don\u2019t have a right to engage in unlawful conduct.\u201d He later added: \u201cWe kept the distance between both groups, and there was no violence \u2026 It could have been a bad situation had it erupted into violence. It did not.\u201d Craig also told the Detroit city council at its regular Tuesday meeting that officers surrounded the marching neo-Nazis and created a \u201cbuffer\u201d to avoid a confrontation between the two sides, adding: \u201cOur strategy worked.\u201d However, bodycam footage that appears to have come from one of the neo-Nazis shows one of them assaulting a woman. The woman, Jessica Prozinski, posted the video to social media. It shows the neo-Nazi knocking her to the ground as she walks in front of them. She said police witnessed the encounter but took no action. \u201cThey saw what happened, but they weren\u2019t protecting us. They did nothing,\u201d Prozinski said. \u201cIt was disgraceful. They provided Nazis with an armed escort up to the gate of Pride where people were in line. I have bruises on my arms, but they\u2019re from the police.\u201d Police also received criticism for not informing the public that the neo-Nazis would be protesting at the festival. Craig said his department was aware of the plans a week ahead of time, but didn\u2019t inform the public or city council in an effort to prevent large clashes. \u201cThey didn\u2019t just want to do what they did in Charlottesville; they wanted an enhanced version of Charlottesville,\u201d Craig told city council. Though there\u2019s currently no evidence that Detroit police worked with the neo-Nazis, police in California, Oregon and other states have coordinated or maintained friendly relationships with far-right groups ahead of similar protests. Police at Michigan State University in early 2018 took a much more passive approach when hundreds of protesters blocked neo-Nazis from entering a Richard Spencer event. That broke out in violence that resulted in injured neo-Nazis fleeing campus. Williams said Detroit police should have been \u201cescorting the Nazis out of downtown, up I-75 \u2026 and out of the city. \u201cThe image of black police officers protecting white Nazis in a majority African American city is a bad image,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is horrible for Detroit.\u201d A police spokesperson said Craig was not immediately available for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
