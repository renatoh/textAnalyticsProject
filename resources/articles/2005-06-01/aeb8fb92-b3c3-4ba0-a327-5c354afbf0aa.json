Each has its own distinctive cry, which its own lambs recognise and answer to. Now the cumulative effect is of a deep, knowing baa with a slightly desperate edge - and the high bleating answers are missing. It could be the lambs have been taken away and the ewes are calling for them. Their constant cries drift across the fields into the thick silence of summer trees. Do sheep hope? Hope may be a bit thin in the skies. Those hopeful symbols of summer, the swifts, swallows and house martins, cannot be described as flocks this year. Although a good number of swifts are screaming around the evening rooftops, swallows are far fewer than in previous years and house martins are pitifully few. Up on Windmill Hill, as the pinky-purple flowering pulse of summer rises through the turf, there is a hopeful signal of the wild. You can't call a gathering of moths a flock, but that's what they're like. Hundreds of six-spot burnet moths skitter through the sward and alight on flowers, alone and in groups. These small but spectacular scarlet and black day-flying moths are a silent flock, browsing on nectar everywhere on the hill. I counted 20 on one clump of wild thyme. They visit all the wild flowers, but are particularly attracted to thyme and orchids, of which there are many common-spotted and pyramidal. Trying to imagine how the moths see the huge pink orbs of pyramidal orchids, I think of the moon rising above the Wrekin on the night of the summer solstice: the biggest, pinkest full moon we've seen. It was an illusion, so we're told, a trick of light and orbit angles. Perhaps I'm as gullible as the sheep, but to me it appeared a hopeful sign."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
