As I progressed within the company, I was particularly bad at projecting my increased authority and therefore struggled to get the necessary respect from suppliers. \"Being a team player is essential. Keep your options open, you never know where a new opportunity may arise. Always be on the look-out for something new, whether a venue, a supplier or just an idea. \"There is a very fine line between working to live and living to work. But the hours do mean that sometimes you have to give up some social activities. I have always got the most satisfaction out of doing something that I didn't think I could achieve initially. Don't be afraid to stretch yourself. \"You need presentation skills, both written and personal. You are always on show and people will buy events based on this.\" Jenny's day-to-day work involves taking calls, venue searching, compiling proposals, following up, meeting clients and planning small events. \"This is my second year of a four-year degree course. Most importantly I want to enjoy what I do. Being a team player is very important and I have come to realise this since working with Fortesqueue's. The hours don't bother me. I'm prepared to do what it takes to deliver the perfect event. It's comforting to hear that you still get nervous and that it can be used to your advantage. By the end of July I want to have managed an event in the structure, done a presentation for new business and successfully made some contacts of my own.\" Interviews by Eileen Sheridan sheri@dircon.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
