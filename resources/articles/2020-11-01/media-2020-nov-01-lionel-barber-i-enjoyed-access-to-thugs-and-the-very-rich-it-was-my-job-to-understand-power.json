It was my job to understand power'", "bodyText": "On the day he was appointed editor of the Financial Times in 2005, Lionel Barber called Ben Bradlee, the man who turned the Washington Post from, as he puts it, \u201ca provincial also-ran into a national must-read\u201d (Bradlee was the paper\u2019s editor at the time of the Watergate scandal). Did his mentor, he wondered, have any advice for him? Pleasingly, he did. Even more pleasingly, this advice sounded as if it had come straight from a movie script. First, Bradlee said, Barber should be sure to \u201cwalk the floor\u201d, in other words, to remain visible to the troops. Second, he should remember that nothing lasts for ever. \u201cThe day you finish as editor, that\u2019s when you find out who your real friends are,\u201d he told Barber, sounding not unlike Jason Robards, who played Bradlee in All the President\u2019s Men. Was he right about this? Fifteen years on, Barber is at last in a position to know, having stood down as editor in January following what he describes in his about-to-be-published diaries as \u201cthree terms\u201d in the job (by his own admission, Barber is obsessed by power and its processes and at moments he starts to sound weirdly presidential himself). He smiles. \u201cHe was partly right,\u201d he says. \u201cMostly, people do call back. But just not as quickly.\u201d And has he, in the months since, been through a grieving process? Such a job, glamorous and important, must have been hard to give up. \u201cNo, no, absolutely not. I had done what I needed to do. The succession had been managed. I\u2019d turned 65. You want to go out on a home run, not with dodgy knees and a bad back.\u201d A banker of his acquaintance once told him that running the FT sounded like being the manager of a rock band, a description that a possibly somewhat flattered Barber thought quite accurate. Now, though, the touring years are over. We meet at his home in suburban south London, a realm of bird tables and Ocado deliveries. No more jetlag. No more starry encounters with the rich and famous. No more creative differences with the editor of How to Spend It. Freedom, in other words. Don\u2019t imagine for a minute, though, that Barber is about to break the cardinal rule of the road (ie what goes on tour stays on tour). Yes, a lot of big names strut and dive across his book\u2019s pages; among those he interviewed during his time at the FT (he was always, as he reminds me more than once, an editor-reporter) are Martin Amis, Barack Obama and Ai Weiwei. But there\u2019s also something peculiarly discreet about it (either that or he\u2019s the least nosy hack who ever lived). Sure, he doesn\u2019t mind dishing on the idiotic Prince Andrew, who tells him that the FT\u2019s \u201cman in Dubai\u201d is causing a lot of trouble (HRH, having got the reporter\u2019s name wrong, then admits to never having read a word he has written). But when, for instance, he goes to the Camerons\u2019 London home for dinner in 2008, he tells us nothing at all about it, not even the colour of Sam\u2019s curtains, perhaps because he\u2019s too busy \u201cpouting\u201d at having been told that Dave would rather not discuss British politics. Two years later, he mentions that he has lunched at San Lorenzo in Knightsbridge with the \u201cflame-haired\u201d Rebekah Brooks, then the editor of the Sun and now the woman who runs Rupert Murdoch\u2019s British operation. But he does not care to reveal what they might have discussed, nor even what impression she made on him. If Sasha Swire, the former Tory MP\u2019s wife who recently published her diaries, was an unstoppable fountain of gossip, splashing the scandal all over, Barber is more of a dripping tap: a drop will come your way in the end, but in the meantime you\u2019ll just have to listen patiently to his thoughts on such things as Davos (where \u201ceven newspaper editors are assigned rooms\u2026 with what appear to be moulded plastic showers\u201d) and M&amp;S underwear (\u201cin my experience, always reliable\u201d). What makes this all the stranger is that his model while working on The Powerful and the Damned was Piers Morgan, whose diaries, wildly more juicy than his own, he considers \u201cjust fantastic\u201d. But then, Barber is a different beast to the former editor of the Daily Mirror: more corporate, more establishment. In his book, for instance, he calls Ed Balls \u201can FT man\u201d, as if the newspaper, which once employed the former chancellor, was a public school or an Oxbridge college. When we come to talk about the Daily Mail, he vigorously defends free speech while simultaneously insisting that he\u2019s not willing to discuss what he thinks of its former editor, Paul Dacre. (Excessive, especially when you consider that the Mail once described Barber as a \u201cweapons-grade social climber\u201d.) Even more amazingly, he tells me rather proudly \u2013 \u201cthis is important\u201d \u2013 that had Nikkei, the Japanese owner of the FT, not agreed to the publication of his diaries \u201csight unseen\u201d, he would not have gone ahead with the project. Crikey. Is he serious? \u201cYes. I have a personal relationship with the proprietor. I would never do anything that wasn\u2019t approved by him.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine Andrew Neil or Harry Evans having taken this line, even if they hadn\u2019t fallen out with Rupert Murdoch. Still, there are fascinating things in his book, if by fascinating we mean uncomfortable. How close should an editor get to certain players? What happens when journalism and social life become blurred? What do his diaries tell us about the ways in which Britain still works, behind the scenes? I was struck by Barber\u2019s attendance in 2018 at a dinner hosted by Evgeny Lebedev, the owner of the Evening Standard, for Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. It\u2019s interesting to learn, especially in the light of the reported security concerns surrounding Lebedev\u2019s recent elevation to the peerage (his father is an ex-KGB agent), that the Russian ambassador, Alexander Yakovenko, was there, too, furiously denying any Russian involvement in the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. But it\u2019s also important to remember that only seven months after this, the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a man with whom Barber once lunched, was murdered in Turkey, allegedly by agents of the Saudi government. Do newspaper editors, like politicians (Tony Blair was another guest), need to think more carefully about their presence at such events? Are they in danger, sometimes, of providing a kind of endorsement? \u201cIt\u2019s a totally legitimate question to debate the balance between access and distance,\u201d Barber says, graciously. \u201cI am very aware that I enjoyed unique access to thugs and to very rich people. But it was my job to understand power, and how power is exercised, and I\u2019m not easily seduced, believe me. Why wouldn\u2019t you go to a dinner with 30 people, where you will bump into the Russian ambassador, and he will talk about Skripal, and you will also see the crown prince talk about his vision? That\u2019s valuable.\u201d He thinks the reader will find such scenes enlightening. \u201cI don\u2019t think the reader will be saying, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m not sure he should have gone to that dinner party\u2019. I think they\u2019ll be saying, \u2018Oh, this is the way it is \u2013 I\u2019ve penetrated the bubble\u2019.\u201d But they won\u2019t admire it, will they? (His tone implies that they will.) \u201cI don\u2019t need to be admired.\u201d What did he make of the fact that Boris Johnson made Lebedev a peer? \u201cTotally neutral,\u201d he says. How can he be neutral about it? He must have a view. \u201cI think there are too many peers, but that\u2019s a separate issue from [talking about] individuals.\u201d Would he like a seat in the House of Lords? (Veronica Wadley, the former editor of the Evening Standard, also got one last time around.) He splutters. \u201cNo one is going to make me a peer. Do you think I\u2019m that chummy with the people in this government?\u201d Maybe not. In his diaries, he reveals that shortly after the EU referendum in 2016, Johnson sent him a text in which he asked when the FT was going to accept that it had lost the argument (the paper was for Remain). \u201cI have never seen such a load of weedy liberal confirmation bias,\u201d Johnson wrote. Barber told him the FT was happy to discuss the road ahead but, as he points out, Johnson did not want to think about that. \u201cYou have to understand the character of the PM,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who has never been prone to following the rules, who\u2019s a cheerleader by temperament and who has now [thanks to the pandemic] been pitched into the biggest public policy crisis in 50 years. Plus, he\u2019s having to manage an exit from the European Union, the difficulty of which I\u2019m quite sure he underestimated.\u201d Is he anxious about what lies ahead? \u201cCatastrophe doesn\u2019t meet it quite yet. But we\u2019re in a hole.\u201d Will there be a deal with the EU? \u201cYe-es\u2026 it\u2019s 65% [certain]. But it will be a skinny deal. The skinniest of all deals.\u201d What role does he think journalism played in getting us to where we are now? \u201cThe original sin is the referendum,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s Cameron\u2019s fault. He was casual beyond belief.\u201d But were we, the media, too complacent? Did we miss the story? In his diaries, after all, he writes that he went to bed \u201cwith a bourbon on the rocks\u201d feeling \u201crelatively relaxed\u201d about the result. He also describes the mood at the FT the next morning as one of \u201cshock\u201d, his colleagues \u201cstunned and slightly embarrassed\u201d (the following day, Barber and his shattered wife, Victoria, sought \u201crefuge\u201d from it all in the \u201cmud and rain\u201d of the Glastonbury festival, where they were, um, the \u201chouse guests\u201d of another former FT man, Roland Rudd, the wealthy PR man who raised millions for Remain, who is the brother of Amber Rudd, the former home secretary, and also, like Barber, a trustee of the Tate). \u201cI acknowledge that,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were too rational. The majority, we thought, won\u2019t vote Leave because it doesn\u2019t make economic sense. Our reporters all came back [from the regions] and said [it will be] Leave, but we failed to distinguish between signal and noise. People were not necessarily going to make rational economic choices. Other factors were in play. We missed that. But we weren\u2019t responsible for losing the campaign.\u201d What effect does he think this has had on confidence in journalism? He doesn\u2019t exactly answer the question, telling me instead that he has some sympathy with what Tim Davie, the director general of the BBC, has said about journalists and social media. \u201cThey\u2019re wearing two hats and they need to be careful,\u201d he says. Does he believe quality journalism can survive in a world where so much information is available for free? \u201cI do. You promise serious journalism and you ask people to pay for it.\u201d (And, sometimes, they do: by the time he stepped down, the FT had 1 million paying readers.) Did it ever strike him as uncomfortable that the FT was apt to trumpet on its masthead a long report on poverty in Blackpool alongside, say, a supplement extolling the virtues of \u00a3100,000 watches? \u201cNo. You can walk and chew gum at the same time. This idea that we\u2019re just there for the elite\u2026 the nobles might have done a better job in 1789 if they\u2019d known what was going on in Paris.\u201d That said, five days after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, he did draw the line at an edition of How to Spend It called \u201cthe Bonus issue\u201d. Barber insists that he was surprised to be made the editor of the FT; he never campaigned for the job and he\u2019d lost out before. But he was always, perhaps, destined to be a journalist. His father, Frank, was a newspaper man to his bones (though he ended up at the BBC, he never gave up his weekend shifts at the Observer and the Sunday Times). \u201cI\u2019m a twin,\u201d says Barber. \u201cAnd one punishment that I remember was that we had to do a front page on the day after Martin Luther King was assassinated. He made us listen to Alistair Cooke [on the BBC] and then we had to get on with it. We would have been 11.\u201d The household was newspaper-obsessed: six were delivered every day. \u201cMy father grew up in Leeds. He left school at 15 and he was totally self-educated. He always wanted to be a journalist and he believed it was a vocation, not a profession, which I also believe intensely. The problem was that he was such a big figure. You thought: I\u2019m never going to be as good as him.\u201d After Oxford, Barber had a conviction that he was going to \u201chelp British industry\u201d (it was the 1970s). But this didn\u2019t work out \u2013 what did he know about selling? \u2013 and he took the only job he was offered, at the Scotsman. Was his father proud of his career? \u201cYes and that mattered to me. He was fairly uncompromising. We all wanted his blessing.\u201d I sense a similar lack of compromise in his son. Even as I\u2019m interviewing him, he keeps telling me how interviews should be done. Of his own interviewees, who beguiled and who disappointed? \u201cWell, I\u2019d never go into an interview thinking: am I going to admire this person? It\u2019s about unlocking them.\u201d It was thrilling meeting Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin in 2019, \u201cthe most cold-blooded person, who is expert in destabilising people\u201d. Donald Trump, in 2017, was \u201cTony Soprano without the charm\u201d, while to be in the presence of Paul Kagame, the \u201cwarrior-president\u201d of Rwanda, was to be in the presence of \u201creal power\u2026 we talked for three-and-a-half hours. My bum was really sore afterwards.\u201d Then there was his trip to Tehran in 2013 with Roula Khalaf, who would eventually succeed him as editor, during which he got President Hassan Rouhani on side by pretending to do a Scottish accent (Rouhani was a postgraduate student in Glasgow). Barber tells me now that he believes you need a \u201czinger\u201d when doing interviews: the disarming killer question. But I\u2019m not so sure. Sometimes \u2013 quite often, in fact \u2013 people dish up themselves, on a plate. \u201cI have got a sense of humour,\u201d he suddenly tells me, as I get up to go. Only one of us is laughing (albeit on the inside) as I carefully write these words next to his email address in my notebook.
