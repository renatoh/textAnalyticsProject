I pay \u00a310 a month for a service agreement covering damages. I sent the laptop back in April because it kept dropping the Wi-Fi connection and turning itself off. It came back with a new hard drive and a damaged case. PC World collected it again but found no fault, yet it still didn't work. They collected it again and changed the drive but sent it back with a broken battery. They will not take responsibility for the damage. They have also lost the charger and the original hard drive with all my personal data on it. NA, Stanmore, Middlesex PC World said it could find no faults after the first repair and the battery showed signs of wear, which is not covered by the service agreement. It knows the charger is missing and says it offered to send you a new one, or the money, but you refused. You deny receiving the offer and said you did not want a new charger until you were confident the computer was working. After further chivvying, PC World again collected your laptop but a month later said it was waiting for parts. Finally it has agreed to give you a voucher worth \u00a3590 plus a goodwill voucher for \u00a3160 which, it says, should buy you a refurbished replacement, all it need provide under the terms and conditions. You have accepted.
