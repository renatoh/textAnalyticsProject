They never recorded, never played live, rehearsed together only once, spending more of their time arguing about the Doors than actually writing anything. And yet they attained mythic status, partly because the band's three members \u2013 Julian Cope, Ian McCulloch and Pete Wylie \u2013 all ascended from indie fame to chart stardom in the early 80s and partly because the trio were such rampant egotists they never stopped referring to the Crucial Three in interviews and, occasionally, songs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
