Booking a double room. Having a candle-lit dinner. Rubbing suntan lotion on each other's backs. Bickering over whose fault it is that you're lost in a flashy hire car in the scary bit of Barcelona. These things cement your relationship abroad, as much as going to Sainsbury's or spending the weekend painting the bedroom do when you're at home. But it's easier for some couples to indulge in such activities than it is for others. Straight ones, for example. If you're gay, basic vacation situations can be problematic. Booking a room may be quite straightforward, but when two blokes or two women turn up to share a double bed, it's not unknown for the hotel receptionist to think there was a mistake and that you really wanted a twin room. The awkwardness is exacerbated when he or she takes too long to twig that no, you really do want a double for you are effectively a married couple. If you're not careful, you can find yourself explaining your relationship with actions too graphic for a hotel lobby, swiftly followed by a chill in the previously amiable guest-receptionist banter. Being the only same-sex pairing in a restaurant replete with romantic rendezvous can be a similarly perplexing prospect. As can the application of Ambre Solaire. Don't even think about running, hand-in-hand, through the sun-warmed surf on a sandy beach, or smooching under the watchful eye of the Statue of Liberty. It's true that homosexuality isn't quite the love that dare not speak its name anymore, but many gay couples - especially outside the so-called liberal metropolitan bubbles - train themselves not to show physical affection for each other in public. This is thoroughly wearing, and definitely something from which you need a holiday. Hence, Spain's Sitges and Miami's South Beach, which are gay resorts in all but name, thrive. On Gran Canaria, Playa des Ingles' Yumbo Centre is a shopping mall by day, gay bar bonanza by night. Like the gay scenes in any of Europe's major cities - notably Amsterdam, Prague, Paris and Berlin - as well as Cape Town and Sydney, these are places of possibility. Places where you can sit in a bar and smooch with your boyfriend, find a club and dance with him, or indeed, find yourself a new beau. After all, everyone loves a holiday romance. And romance is certainly in the balmy evening air of Sicily's Club Pollina resort as 500 gay men gear up for a night of clubbing under a wide Mediterranean sky studded with stars. Well, it smells like romance. It could be M7 by Yves Saint Laurent. Or possibly testosterone. Whatever it is, with the music and the moonlight and the low chirrup of crickets, the dusk is ripe with expectation. It's like that bit before the rumble in West Side Story. Something might happen. The bar is busy and at the tables among the trees, groups of men chat amiably, all the while checking out either the competition or the prey in the vicinity. After a day of sun worshipping with a dedication to make the Incas blush, the bold and the beautiful have donned their designer gear and dressed to impress. Of course, when the DJ powers up and the dancefloor fills, it will start to get hot and tops will come off to reveal buff muscle, peachy pecs, shapely six-packs and biteable biceps. These boys aren't what you'd call shy. If you totted up everyone's gym memberships, you'd probably have the GDP of Luxembourg. If you think the regular gay scene is populated by body fascist gym bunnies, imagine a place where Speedos are daywear and jeans and not much else is evening dress. It's perhaps apt that we're on an island - there is the distinct possibility of a Lord of the Flies situation with a hierarchy forming based entirely on how pert your pecs are. (But, then, that's life all over, isn't it?) A pounding bass line emanates, as bodies move in time on the intimate dancefloor. For the moment anyway, everyone seems friendly. The dancing will continue until gone-four, though many couples will have hooked up before then and taken a romantic stroll down the cliff top path, or else walked back up to the hotel for a nightcap and a discussion of the merits of Holly Valance's new single. This is the second night of a week-long jolly organised by Alternative Holidays, a firm that specialises in gay package holidays aimed at the more well-heeled homosexual. For a seat aboard a special charter flight from Gatwick plus accommodation and meals (from a classic all-inclusive trough buffet), this one costs from a not insubstantial \u00a3748 per person based on two people sharing. Drinks at the bar are extra. If you've ever seen gay men drink, you'll understand why. While this is expensive, there are plenty willing to pay. The pink pound shows no sign of going the way of the Argentinian peso. Alternative Holidays started out organising European Gay Ski Week, in 1997. It took over a resort with snow and packed it with gay blokes (and gals, but mostly blokes) in salopettes. They skied by day and partied by night with various entertainers laid on (drag queens, cabaret acts) before renowned London DJs took charge of wowing the crowd. Since then, Alternative Holidays have organised seven ski weeks, a safari, and two summer holidays. \"We select the finest resorts and take them over, so you can relax in a totally safe, friendly and completely open environment in the very best of company,\" says the company's website. This translates as: \"You can kiss boys by the pool, ogle blokes sunbathing, and not have to worry about anyone getting abusive. Unless that's what you like, of course.\" Pollina is Alternative's third summer vacation and, the bun fight nightmare of getting aboard a bus at Palermo airport notwithstanding, they have just about perfected the formula. DJs lined up for the week include Steve Pitron and Paul Heron from London's legendary Crash and Rich B from Love Muscle. The entertainment includes drag artiste Kandi Kane (think Will and Grace's Karen Walker with an 18 certificate) and Pam Ann, the world's rudest air stewardess. With the emphasis definitely on hedonism, holidays such as this are not for the faint-hearted. There is a lot of partying, sunbathing and not a whole lot else to do. There are day trips and activities to be enjoyed or endured, but mostly, the lads are here for canoodling rather than canoeing. By no means as crude as a Club 18 to 30 holiday, it has a similar air, albeit more sophisticated, and there are a lot of single men here on the pull. The more jaded urban gay might find it all a bit overwhelming - Soho-on-Sea, if you like - but for some, holidays like this one are an escape, a respite, a week of freedom, giddiness and, yes, shagging. You can see the attraction. And it sure beats Blackpool. Way to go Alternative Holidays offers a winter package, European Gay Ski Week, between March 13-20 2004 at Club Med Alpe d'Huez. Prices start from \u00a3699 per person, based on three sharing, and include seven nights' all-inclusive full-board accommodation, all drinks, six-day ski pass and the fabled entertainment. Flights are not included but available from Alternative Holidays. Summer Fun in the Sun 2004 details available online soon.
