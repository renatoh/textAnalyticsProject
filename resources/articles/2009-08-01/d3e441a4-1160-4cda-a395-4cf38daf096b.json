I shouldn't complain, but I'm finding summer very stressful. Also, I have to work. \"The thing about you,\" my wife says, \"is that you can work anywhere.\" My wife's view of me as an essentially portable breadwinner informs all our travel plans. That's why we're back in the car after just a few days in London, heading for a cottage in a picturesque seaside town. This final leg of the summer holidays has been booked for months, but thinking about it causes a knot to form in the pit of my stomach. It just seems like an additional week in which something could go wrong \u2013 a holiday too far. We arrive in the seaside town and are met by friends who have rented a cottage nearby. As we unpack, I give voice to several competing anxieties, about parking, about the dog, about work. \"Relax,\" says my wife. \"You have to work?\" our friend says. \"Don't worry,\" my wife says. \"The thing about him is he can work anywhere.\" My wife goes off to see their cottage while I stay behind to establish an internet connection so I can start work. I try every gadget in my sack of dongles and wires. Nothing works. The air here has no internet in it. I end up standing on a dresser while holding my laptop out of the bedroom window, thinking about the many different places I have travelled to in order to work from: the field in Cornwall where I found a faint mobile signal, the hotel lobby in Slovakia, the Turkish internet cafe, the services on the M5. Below me, my children and the children of our friends are conducting an incredibly loud conversation, half in the cottage and half in the street, shrieking at each other through the open front door. I go downstairs to tell them to be quiet. \"This is not Naples,\" I say. \"If you wish to continue to\u2026\" I stop and look at the open front door. \"Where's the dog?\" I ask. \"Dunno,\" the oldest one says. I step into the street. The dog never runs off \u2013 she's been standing directly behind me for the last eight years \u2013 but she's not outside and she's not inside. It's obvious to me what has happened: a whole summer of continuous geographical displacement has finally taken its toll. The dog has suffered some kind of freak-out and is now charging aimlessly through an unfamiliar seaside town. This is not a good start to the work day. I send the children in one direction and I go off in the other. After a few minutes, I realise I am more or less lost myself. Eventually I reach the crowded high street. I don't see the dog anywhere, but I immediately run into some people I know. \"Hello!\" one of them says. \"You look lost.\" \"I've lost my dog,\" I say. We chat for a while, but we're not really on the same wavelength. They're on holiday and I'm having a panic attack. As we talk, a car drives by with someone else I know in it. He waves at me. As I walk along I begin to think that everyone looks familiar. Across the street a door opens and a woman I vaguely recognise steps out. Most people have sunglasses on, so I can't tell whether or not I should say hello. \"What kind of town is this?\" I think. Has the whole of Shepherd's Bush decamped here in order to experience substandard Wi-Fi provision? What's relaxing about that? I find it too stressful to remain on the high street \u2013 what if I meet someone whose name I can't remember? \u2013 so I duck down a quiet little lane to my left. Up ahead I see the dog coming towards me. We stop and stare at each other with sad, freaked-out eyes. \"Where have you been?\" I say. \"Who have you seen?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
