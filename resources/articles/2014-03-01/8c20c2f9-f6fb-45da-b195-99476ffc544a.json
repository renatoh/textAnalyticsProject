It could just as easily have been part of the pledge that CIA director John Brennan made in wooing the Senate Intelligence Committee to confirm him just over a year ago. Tantalizing as the promise of truth may have been, transparency has never been a virtue of the CIA, especially when it comes to fessing up. And now members of the same committee that confirmed Brennan, among them a fiery Sen Diane Feinstein, are accusing the CIA of lawlessness and blatant intimidation of Senate staffers, spying on them and threatening criminal prosecution for their pursuit of documents related to the post-9/11 detention and interrogation programs. The spy chief\u2019s response to the growing crisis has been a vintage Agency mix of denial and defiance \u2013 and yet John Brennan\u2019s is a new kind of defiance for threatened architects of the CIA\u2019s dark arts, an unflinching brand of outright denial. On Tuesday, he labeled some of Feinstein\u2019s allegations about the torture program \u201centirely fiction\u201d, sloughing off accusations with his own Langley-style intimidation. \u201cNothing could be further from the truth,\u201d he said of accusations that his agents had accessed Senate computers. This isn\u2019t just another Washington turf war or a real-life episode of Homeland. This is more like the old Mad Magazine cartoon Spy v Spy writ large, with so many egos involved it\u2019s near impossible to know who has the upper hand. But Langley, as ever, is writing the rules. Or at least trying to. The confrontation between that Senate Intelligence Committee and the Agency began as a fight over an internal CIA report said to be sharply critical of Langley\u2019s record on those torture programs \u2013 hardly an anomaly in the annals of the Central Intelligence Agency. Indeed, when it comes to penning the history of the CIA, it is the CIA which has always insisted on holding the bluntest of instruments. If you study that history as I have, you\u2019ll realize the stakes for Langley bosses are always highest when programs have gone awry or legacies hang in the balance. Both are at issue in this dust-up, and both explain why Brennan and his minions appear to have decided that the best defense is a good offense. What\u2019s different now, in the age of WikiLeaks, Edward Snowden and a much-emboldened Senate, is that the CIA no longer has the same control over its message, that decades of earlier revelations and denials have left the Agency both less potent and less persuasive in cowing its critics. An Agency history of its own making \u2013 and masking This is hardly the first time that the CIA has steadfastly refused to contribute to the writing of history, even as it defines its own legacy \u2013 all masked failures and hints of secret triumphs, a dangle of endless usefulness in fending off criticism. The editors of the Foreign Relations of the United States at the State Department have for decades wrestled with the CIA, trying to persuade them to release documents so that the official history of US foreign policy is not glaringly incomplete. Time and again, the CIA has refused to cooperate: a 1990 history of US-Iranian relations failed to note the CIA-engineered coup in that country four decades earlier. Volumes on the Philippines, Greece and the Congo also bear witness to the Agency\u2019s stranglehold on history. And no one need remind Brennan of the fate of former Director William Colby, reviled for turning over what became disparagingly known as \u201cThe Family Jewels\u201d to Senate investigators in 1975 during the Church hearings. That list of potential CIA abuses was so named because it was feared exposure would emasculate the Agency. (Many would argue it did just that.) Colby was branded a pariah by many Agency lifers. Brennan, nothing if not a \u201ccompany man\u201d, has no wish to follow suit. Defending a legacy of violence \u2013 and its perpetrators What John Brennan inherited as CIA director is not merely an agency but a narrative, one that he contradicts at the perils of his fellow spies, the citizens he vowed to serve and himself. Those who now serve under him seek assurances that, when asked to undertake a shady or extra-legal action, they will not one day find themselves exposed as policy or administration changes \u2013 black sites, interrogation, drones, whatever comes next. Brennan may be a new director, but he is a 25-year veteran of the CIA and the man who held key positions at Langley during much of the period under scrutiny. He is steeped in that loyal and steadfast culture, and he understands the fallout should he be seen caving to Congressional pressure, his own declarations of Glasnost notwithstanding. True, some architects of the torture years have moved on \u2013 among them, Jose Rodriguez. He\u2019s penned a book called Hard Measures, trumpeting the benefits of enhanced interrogation, and joined a speaker\u2019s bureau. (Ironically, he is billed as a \u201cmotivational speaker\u201d \u2013 indeed, he has motivated many to speak.) But others remain at Langley. Each cites the \u201cbut for\u201d test \u2013 absent detention, waterboarding and the like, America would have been vulnerable, its enemies given a free hand. That storyline has been sold hard. It may not have persuaded everyone, but it muddied the waters just enough to leave some unsure and resistant to calls for accountability. Still, Brennan doubtless sees the Senate\u2019s demands for the internal report as an invitation to throw his people under the bus. Likewise, the Senate now sees the CIA\u2019s call for potential criminal prosecution of its staffers as a threat to their own, not to mention a frontal assault on the separation of powers. Both sides are dug in, determined to show that they have the backs of those who serve them. Don\u2019t mess with the Senate To be sure, the CIA\u2019s foes in this week\u2019s shadow game \u2013 the members and staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee \u2013 are hardly blameless themselves. Where was all this moral indignation of some when these abuses were actually going on? Either they knew and stayed quiet, or they didn\u2019t know and were derelict. The Senate, too, is used to having its way, staging carefully choreographed hearings designed for media consumption as much as fact-finding. Senators do not take kindly to having their people threatened and spied upon, and their disgruntlement is certain to be heard on Sunday talk shows for weeks. Ultimately, the way out of this standoff may come from some intermediary \u2013 the Department of Justice, the White House or some other entity pushing for an end, possibly by way of the release of that too-long-classified Senate torture report. But don\u2019t expect the parties themselves to behave as grown-ups. And there is something endearingly na\u00efve about a public, much less a Senate, that still imagines a CIA capable of transparency. At Langley, lying is not a sin \u2013 it is a form of tradecraft. But in taking on the Senate Intelligence Committee and its staffers, the Agency may well have gone too far in a new age of power. Like Wall Street, the CIA has remained largely beyond the reach of both the law and sunlight. But it\u2019s no longer a given that the Agency can retreat to the shadows."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
