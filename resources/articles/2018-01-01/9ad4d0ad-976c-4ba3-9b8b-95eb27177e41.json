Mercier\u2019s crew of good police grieving their buddy seem instead to be child abusing scumbags, who may well have had a hand in his death. Elsewhere, Jos\u00e9phine has another abuser in her sights and we can only imagine what she\u2019s got lined up for him. The Mercier case The body of 14-year-old missing girl Justine Fabre showing up is the big break the case needed. Justine, the mysterious Bambi from Mercier\u2019s texts, died from septicaemia after a botched caesarean. Mercier took a personal interest in her case and that may well have been what got him killed. Justine\u2019s boyfriend Enzo puts them onto her best friend Maria. After letting her slip through their clutches at the train station, they put the Roma camp she lives in under surveillance. Mercier\u2019s two colleagues Jolers and Calvi show up and it looks like they are running underage sex workers from the camp, or abusing them personally. Maybe this is why his colleagues thought Laurent was \u201ctoo nice\u201d. CID follow the pair to social housing built by the council where they meet Captain Etcheverry of the IPCC - the anticorruption unit investigating Mercier\u2019s crew. That will explain why the phone taps turned up nothing incriminating. Roban was right (and, to be fair, so was Beckriche). The raid on the Roma camp goes badly. Herville sends in the storm troopers and a big conflagration ensues. You have to hand it to CID: they turn what was a peaceful camp into the Waco siege in about 10 minutes. Both Tintin and Laure get bashed and Maria, the object of the search, is nowhere to be found. Scratch another one in the loss column. Roban The principle of reciprocity is the oil that greases the gears of the justice system - you do for me as I do for you. So when Roban asks Machard to reassign the Fabre case to CID after saving his career last time out, it is the merest formality that he will agree. But Machard being Machard, he point blank refuses like the pantomime villain he is. He\u2019s got more front than Brighton this one and you kind of have to applaud his unyielding commitment to being a rotter. It works out OK for Roban as once Enzo\u2019s sweatshirt is discovered in Mercier\u2019s locker, he is able to hand the case over without Machard\u2019s help. As for his health troubles, his brain biopsy goes ahead without a hitch, but we won\u2019t know the outcome until at least next week. Fingers crossed for the good guy. Jos\u00e9phine Ms Karlsson reaches rock bottom during a late-night meltdown when she calls Laure round to her apartment having downed a bottle of wine. She wants to let her know that the bastards have won - every degenerate man in her life from her father onwards. She rallies strongly the following day though to deliver an impassioned summing up in Thomas\u2019s case, drawing on her own personal experience of emotional abuse. It does the trick. Thomas gets away with eight years, which even Edelman acknowledges is a miracle. There\u2019s every chance he\u2019ll be out in five. It\u2019s a vindication both of her strategy and her gladiatorial skills in the court room. Turning her attention to her rape, Edelman\u2019s apparently solid alibi for the night of her assault means she has to think again on her attacker. Discovering her missing earring in Vern Jr\u2019s car appears to confirm him as her rapist. She still goes on to successfully defend him on a sexual harassment charge at an arbitration committee. Predictably, he\u2019s already on a caution for a previous offence. When Laure tells her CCTV catches Vern Jr in the vicinity on the night of her rape, Jos\u00e9phine tells her she won\u2019t be pursuing the case. Nothing is worse for her than being a victim. Which is not to say that she is letting this drop. She stalks Vern Jr as he leaves work and steals his car keys. She may not trust the system but she\u2019s got something waiting for him. Thoughts and observations \u201cThink of me like a transponder attached to your belt.\u201d Beckriche, showcasing an unheralded gift for alarming imagery. Ruben gets a clump around the ear from Tintin for going AWOL and it\u2019s all the excuse Christine needs to take him off his hands. You can basically forget about a cosy home life if you\u2019re in CID. Romy is now breathing unaided and Laure finally starts to feel like she has a daughter. She may also have a life partner now that Gilou has dumped Cindy. They finish the week as fully fledged lovers. She\u2019s handled him at his worst so maybe she deserves him at his best."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
