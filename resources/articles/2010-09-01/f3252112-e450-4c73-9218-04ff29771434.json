There is no future for that, there never was\" (Clegg's left warning, 18 September). This is at odds with the increased Lib Dem share of votes and seats under Charles Kennedy at the 2001 and 2005 elections, when they campaigned on such policies as raising the top rate of income tax and abolishing tuition fees and council tax. In 2005 nearly all their electoral success was at Labour's expense \u2013 the \"decapitation\" strategy against the Tories failed almost completely. This year, too, they were widely perceived as being to Labour's left during the campaign \u2013 promising a mansion tax, a bank levy, to take the poor out of poverty and not to renew Trident \u2013 and again they gained votes (though not seats, thanks to our archaic electoral system). In stark contrast, in the mere four months since the Lib Dems joined David Cameron's rightwing coalition and put their weight behind his ultra-Thatcherite cuts, their poll rating has plummeted twice as badly as Labour's did in the five years from victory in 2005 to defeat in 2010. Laurie Marks Cambridge \u2022\u2008Danny Alexander, perhaps unwittingly, lets us see all too clearly where his own political allegiances lie in his description of Gladstone ('We did in 13 weeks what Labour didn't do in 13 years', 18 September). The later, liberal Gladstone could never have been described as \"stern and unbending\". The phrase refers to his earlier political career, when the Whig historian Macaulay called him \"the rising hope of those stern and unbending Tories\". Mr Alexander is in the wrong party, but not the wrong government. Mark Nixon Allandale, Falkirk \u2022\u2008Lord Rennard is quite right \u2013 it won't be enough for Lib Dems to claim the credit, inter alia, for \"guaranteeing significant pension increases\" (The point of government, 18 September). This will be especially true when pensioners realise that the measure of inflation used to increase pensions has been deliberately lowered and the increase in the age at which pensions can be drawn significantly advanced. Jeremy Beecham Labour, House of Lords \u2022\u2008How depressing that of all the key policy areas for checking Lib Dem progress (Did the Lib Dems achieve their objectives?, 17 September), you didn't think the environment or ecology was important enough to include. Every one you did feature is ultimately dependent on it. There is no social justice on a dead planet. Dr Patrick Curry London"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
