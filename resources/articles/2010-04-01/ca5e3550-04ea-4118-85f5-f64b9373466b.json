Work riders from the many other stables nearby are indistinguishable in a variety of outfits but Sheikh Mohammed's team look like an especially well-turned-out army as they arrive on the heath. What no one knows yet is whether any of those precious animals, many of them purchased for six- or seven-figure sums, are any good. They make quite an impression when gathered together at six in the morning, but they will be tested individually on Europe's most famous racecourses and it is there that Godolphin's runners have been failing in recent seasons. Until the second half of last year, that is. As this paper noted in June, the operation had seemed on the way to their worst ever performance in this country, their horses winning races at a very tepid strike rate of 14%, well below the 19% which had been their lowest in the previous eight years. By November, those travails seemed a distant memory. Godolphin's trainer, Saeed bin Suroor, ended 2009 with a strike rate of 28% and \u00a32.7m in prize money secured. More importantly, he had trained the first two horses home in the St Leger, giving the stable their first English Classic success since Rule Of Law won the same race in 2004. \"It's all teamwork,\" Sheikh Mohammed said in the winner's enclosure at Doncaster. \"Everyone in Godolphin is a team-worker. These are horses, not machines, and sometimes you have sickness in the stable or something, but when you get better the team is there. I am very proud of my team.\" But when it is suggested to Simon Crisford, Godolphin's spokesman, that last year ended as an unexpected success in Britain, he sighs impatiently. Anyone who looks at the stable's record in one country alone is missing the point, he argues. \"The most important thing, which never seems to get put across, is that Godolphin is an international stable,\" Crisford says. \"Once people begin to understand that, then they can understand Godolphin. \"We are not an English stable. Yes, we are based here in the summer, because we have to be. We can't come here as raiders from Dubai because the logistics would just be impossible. As far as the English season goes, of course we like to be competitive in the big races.\" With regard to last season's achievements, Crisford points to the total of 202 races won around the world, easily breaking Godolphin's previous best of 133. There were also 13 successes in Group or Grade One races, not only in Britain but also in France, Italy and the United States, where Godolphin won the Eclipse award for outstanding owner. Most notable was the narrow victory pulled off by Vale Of York, a 25-1 shot, in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile in California, only the fourth Breeders' Cup race ever won by the stable and made all the sweeter by the fact that the horse was ridden by Ahmed Ajtebi, a native Dubaian whose ability has been promoted by the sheikh over the past year. Frankie Dettori remains the rider most closely associated with the team but, after 16 years of service, it seems he can no longer expect to get the leg-up on every major prospect. Something similar is happening with Godolphin's trainers. Saeed bin Suroor has been the man running things for them in Newmarket since 1995 but now he is just one of two, following last month's decision to appoint the 33-year-old Mahmood al-Zarooni as a second trainer. \"Saeed raced more than 200 individual horses last year and we decided we had so many horses that we wanted to spread the workload,\" Crisford explains. \"So we promoted from within. Mahmood worked for us last year as an assistant to Saeed, who has several assistants, and we are looking forward to seeing him having plenty of runners.\" Bin Suroor describes Zarooni's appointment as \"a great idea\" and claims to have suggested it together with Crisford. But there must be an obvious possibility for tension between the two men, who will be based within a mile of each other in Newmarket, Bin Suroor at Godolphin Stables and Zarooni at Moulton Paddocks. What if one enjoys success while the other does not? Crisford is not disposed to sound concerned about such a possibility. \"Formula One drivers in the same stable compete,\" he says. \"But they are both working for Godolphin. Godolphin is the brand and the brand is what is important. \"When a horse comes into Godolphin, Sheikh Mohammed and I will talk and he will decide which horse goes to which stable. And I'm sure he will keep the balance as even and as fair as he can.\" Bin Suroor will have around 150 horses, Zarooni 100 or more. Zarooni prepared Godolphin's only winner on the night of the Dubai World Cup, Calming Influence, and also saddled Allybar to be third in the big race under Ajtebi, while Bin Suroor's Mastery was fifth under Dettori. But it is Bin Suroor who is in pole position to give Godolphin what would be their first victory in the 2,000 Guineas since 1999 when the first Classic of the year is staged at Newmarket on Saturday. He trains Al Zir, who appears to be the operation's main hope from three possible runners. Several bookmakers reported support for the colt this week and he is now a general 25-1 chance, though Coolmore, bitter rivals of Godolphin, have the hot favourite in St Nicholas Abbey. Crisford is cautious, as he is wont to be. \"Al Zir seems to have strengthened up over the winter,\" he reports, adding that the horse worked well under Dettori this week. \"He's got a lot to prove still. He's got to do more than last year and there's a long way to go.\" Poet's Voice and Buzzword are the other possible Guineas contenders, though one of them will probably be saved for a tilt at the French or Irish equivalents. Meanwhile, Godolphin continue to suffer what seems like more than their fair share of problems with their high-profile horses. Kingsfort, whose Guineas credentials would have been more obvious than Al Zir's, is on the sidelines until midsummer with a fetlock injury, while there is diminishing hope about getting Passion For Gold to the track in time for the Derby, after he sustained a pulled muscle in his back. \"Yes, that was frustrating,\" Crisford admits, \"but that's what happens to athletes. You have to look at the big picture. We hope that he is going to be competing in big races for the next two years, so we're only losing a few weeks at this stage.\" Just the same, it would mean everything to Crisford if Newmarket could bring some good news next weekend. The great Godolphin revival is about to be put to the test."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
