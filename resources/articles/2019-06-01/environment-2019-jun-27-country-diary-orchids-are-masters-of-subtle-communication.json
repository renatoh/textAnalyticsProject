In this flowering rough, the common spotted-orchids vary from deep pink to almost white; the palest show their bee guides most strongly as dark purple-blue lines on the petals, which draw the ultraviolet vision of insects to find the flower, take the nectar and disseminate the pollen. This is only a fragment of the purposes of the communication of information through these beautifully subtle signs. They also seem to draw the life and history of this scrappy little acre into its wild flowers under a sky lowering with the threat of a June downpour. Each flower becomes a locus in a complex web of information: the weather and climatic changes, the shifting patterns of colonisation in the meadow, the dramas of people, the fungal underground, the grazing pressure and pathogens, the time-travelling data in pollen. These processes are changing in the landscape around this place, too. Up on Windmill Hill, the pyramidal orchids are blooming a much darker purple this year than their usual cerise; they seemed agonisingly late but now they\u2019re prolific. In the Gleddins, the grassy banks of old quarry spoil are scrubbing over and bright blue patches of milkwort are lost under moss and bramble; there are twayblade orchids along the paths there but none yet in flower. Back in the \u201cweedling wild\u201d, as John Clare would call it, between the old railway line and the sewage works, is a post-pastoral pasture: it has nothing to do with shepherds and nostalgia; it is abandoned, uncultivated and finds itself at the edges of civilisation. At the mercy of periodic bulldozing, and who knows what in the future, it has its own will to flower. The common-spotted, pyramidal and northern marsh orchids are later this year and smaller than last; the colony of bee orchids has vanished; the patches of bird\u2019s-foot trefoil have spread; the deer and rabbit grazing has decreased and the brambles are increasing. There is the stiff black rope of a dead grass snake, the green woodpecker\u2019s cackle that speaks of rain, distant traffic, bees, a small heath butterfly \u2013 these signs amount to a natural constructivism, a fragmented and incomplete language of ecology and place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
