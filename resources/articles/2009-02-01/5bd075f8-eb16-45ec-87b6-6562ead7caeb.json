With a few mighty blows Andrew Flintoff's market price in these volatile times might go up a hundred thousand dollars or so in the imminent IPL auction. It may be that his value had dipped after his efforts on the first day. On Wednesday Flintoff had batted responsibly but crabbily. It was not an innings to impress IPL purchasers. But perhaps there would be mayhem in the morning. In fact, Flintoff could not add a single. A limp cut-shot ended in the hands of Brendan Nash at backward point. Even worse, Nash had to display some patience waiting for the ball to arrive. Flintoff's rehabilitation to Test cricket is uneven. Somehow, provided the body is not rebelling, he can pound up to the crease, propel the ball at around 90 mph in the right direction as if he has been doing just that for the last 12 months. Not for the first time Flintoff, by a disturbing margin, was England's best bowler yesterday. But such an easy rehabilitation does not apply to his batting; Flintoff is currently a juggernaut that cannot get out of third gear. For fluency and clean hitting England had to look to Matt Prior, comfortably England's second-best batsman in their innings, behind only Kevin Pietersen. Half close your eyes and there is his agent and mentor at the crease: Alec Stewart. There is the no-nonsense march to the wicket, the creases of his shirt glistening with military precision. After a crisp boundary, not easy to achieve on Sabina Park's spongy outfield, there is a vaguely disdainful glance down the pitch at the bowler. If he has to run, the bat is held on a dapper horizontal plane \u2013 just like Alec. However, there are a few things Prior needs to work on to match Stewart. He does not twiddle his blade with the same \u00e9lan between deliveries. Nor upon dismissal has he mastered the tuck of the bat under the armpit with the simultaneous removal of his gloves. The other area requiring improvement if Prior is to satisfy the Stewart standard is his wicketkeeping. By the end Stewart, who began his England career in the Caribbean in 1990 as a specialist batsman, was a highly capable keeper. But we still notice Prior's aberrations \u2013 there were a few too many byes yesterday. Now a less likely comparison with one of the great players of the recent past: close the eyes again \u2013 a little more than when watching Prior \u2013 and can you spy Marcus Trescothick when Ryan Sidebottom is at the crease? Watch how the noble Sidebottom sets himself up in his stance. His trigger movements \u2013 well known since the Guardian's acquisition of Duncan Fletcher \u2013 are almost identical to those of the Somerset opener. Once the ball has been released the parallel does not hold up quite so well. However, the best batting of the day came from West Indies. Chris Gayle, with a healthy bank balance and the responsibility of the captaincy, has discovered discretion alongside his ability to hit magisterial sixes. Ramnaresh Sarwan, meanwhile, batted as we assume Lazarus would have done. For centuries the umpire's raised finger has signalled a little death, the point of no return, empty despair. Yesterday Sarwan would have undergone all those emotions. Then Gayle gave him licence to refer the decision to the third umpire and the relief Sarwan subsequently felt must have been in a different league from that of a batsman benefiting from a dropped catch or a missed stumping. With a new life Sarwan was galvanised and batted with his old freedom. We are still growing accustomed to the practicalities of the referral system. The analysts should also address the psychological consequences. How can the fielding side douse the spirits of a reincarnated batsman? England were incapable of that last night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
