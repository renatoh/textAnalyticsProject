Three goals in five remarkable minutes last night lifted his team 12 points clear of the relegation zone and kept Albion deep in trouble. A scrappy game looked to be heading for a stalemate until the 73rd minute when Steed Malbranque's cross was headed in by Louis Saha as Phil Gilchrist dithered. Then Malbranque, the oustanding performer, tapped a free-kick for Pierre Wome to score from 25 yards before himself scoring a penalty awarded for a push by Neil Clement on Saha. Albion, for whom Lee Hughes wasted two good chances at 0-0, must pick themselves up to face West Ham on Sunday. There had been no mistaking the importance of this game to both teams in their attempts to avoid relegation to the First Division. If many had expected Albion to struggle, Fulham's chairman Mohamed al Fayed had gone into the season with hopes of a top-half finish. Instead he has watched a period of struggle, and Fulham could have been behind inside five minutes. Lee Hughes was sent through but, on a rare start in place of the suspended Jason Roberts, he shot too close to Maik Taylor. Fulham started in fairly direct fashion, looking to knock early crosses in to the box, and Louis Saha snatched at one half-chance. But the quality of delivery was not often good enough to disturb Albion and take advantage of a formation which saw Steve Marlet get into advanced positions from right midfield. Hence it was Albion, typically aggressive in midfield, who looked the likelier scorers to begin with. The frantic pace of the game allowed little room for individuality but Jason Koumas demonstrated his ability with an excellent run which culminated in him shooting wide. When finally Fulham carved out a fine opportunity they lacked the composure to take it. Malbranque's burst and low cross presented Saha with a chance, but the striker missed his kick and Marlet took too long in his effort to force in the loose ball. The home side began to dominate towards the interval and force Albion back, though the half ended with both teams going close. No sooner had Gilchrist cleared off the line from Sava than a quick Albion break enabled Koumas to put Hughes clean through, but Taylor came off his line to make a good stop. Gary Megson sent his team out a couple of minutes early for the second half to warm up but they never looked like catching Fulham cold. Not that Tigana's players provided much to heat up their supporters amid untidy fare early. The travelling fans did shout for a penalty but it was a sign of Hughes' lack of confidence that he had theatrically thrown himself to the turf under a challenge by the substitute Abdeslam Ouaddou. When Malbranque had a shot deflected over at the other end, few would have anticipated anything other than a goalless draw."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
