So it's surprising that they are not shouting from the rooftops about the latest report on the tremendous benefits of European funding. This money is being used to great effect. It is valued by the educational and training organisations that spend it. It is equally appreciated by those running the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) because it significantly helps them to meet their targets. So why no headlines? Is this unusual reticence a late outbreak of Euroscepticism in the Department for Education and Skills? More realistically, does the DfES fear that the imminent shrinking in European funds, an inevitable result of enlargement, will mean further cuts to the already damaged fabric of adult further education? Or could it be that praising the flexibility of European funding and stressing its achievements risks underlining how straitjacketed the funding for mainstream adult FE has now become? In recent years the LSC, as a co-financing agency, has handled annually between \u00a3150m and \u00a3200m of European funding, mainly from the European Social Fund (ESF). Around a fifth of the money has contributed to programmes concerned with employer engagement. Just under a fifth has been focused on work with Neets (those not in education, employment or training) and a similar sum on adult basic skills. A report that I co-authored with Gordon Kirk for the Learning and Skills Development Agency shows that while ESF money is not used directly to deliver LSC targets, it has a substantial indirect effect. Success can be demonstrated in terms of qualifications gained as well as the participation of marginal groups. It is more than just the sum of money that matters; \u00a3200m is not a large amount in terms of the LSC's \u00a36bn budget, though it is an increasingly large proportion of expenditure on adult learning. ESF, however, appears to reach the parts that mainstream funding cannot. Time and again those Kirk and I spoke to referred to the benefit of ESF in terms of its being \"more flexible\" than mainstream funding. An important part of the report was to unpick what this greater flexibility meant. First, ESF funds are not tied so closely to learner numbers and volumes of qualifications. Local offices have been able to use ESF to fund the foundations on which subsequent, more target-focused work can build. Thus in many areas there was a significant investment in developing employer links, not constrained by the student number targets on which college funding rigidly depends. Second, funding is not tied to the same short-term performance targets. So as the LSC sought to drive up performance on entry to employment (E2E) by focusing attention on the need to increase the numbers achieving in 22 weeks, and providers inevitably responded by dropping some of their more challenging clients, ESF stepped into the gap, helping to fund a raft of pre-E2E programmes. Sometimes flexibility simply meant provision that is inevitably more expensive than average could be properly resourced. Among the examples that came up repeatedly was outreach work. ESF provision allowed adult basic skills work, and priority activity with Neet clients, to proceed. The only negative element identified in the report is the limited impact that ESF-funded programmes are having on modifying mainstream provision. Local staff across the country were concerned at the temporary nature of ESF funding and were anxious to protect the valuable work it had supported. Almost always, however, the response was to search for some other funding source, not to plan how the same benefits could be derived from the mainstream funding route. We have to ask why, and whether we can't organise our mainstream funds to have some of the same flexibility that appears to underlie the success of ESF. \u00b7 Mick Fletcher is an education consultant"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
