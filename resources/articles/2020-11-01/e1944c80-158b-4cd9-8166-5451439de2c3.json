His side lost the penalty count 14-7 but he felt England\u2019s 11-point winning margin came down to incorrect decisions. He was angry that England\u2019s opening try, scored by Henry Slade, was allowed to stand after he claimed Dan Biggar had been tackled in the air by Sam Underhill and he argued that two of the scrum penalties that Owen Farrell kicked came because an England prop lost his footing which prompted a collapse. \u201cWe talk to World Rugby about refs every week,\u201d said Pivac. \u201cWe will do it on this occasion because I was not happy with England\u2019s first try. The television match official called a tackle in the air but the referee overruled him. Our captain [Alun Wyn Jones] asked him to have a look at it but was dismissed. \u201cThere were a number of penalties awarded at the scrum and, in some cases, wrongly. If a prop loses his footing and a scrum goes down, it is his fault. They got six points through that.\u201d Eddie Jones, when asked for his reaction to the decisions, said he never commented about the referee. Seven months ago, the England head coach was reprimanded by the Rugby Football Union for disparaging remarks he made about the referee Ben O\u2019Keeffe last March following the victory over Wales at Twickenham. \u201cI would like us to play with more fluency, but I was pleased with the effort,\u201d said Jones, after his side reached next weekend\u2019s Autumn Nations Cup final at Twickenham, with France the opposition (unless Les Bleus suffered a shock defeat by Italy last night). \u201cI would like us to show more precision with the ball in hand, but it is not quite there. At least we have a week to go.\u201d Jones said one of the most pleasing aspect about England\u2019s biggest victory in Wales for 17 years was that they did not come unstuck when Wales hit back in the second half, unlike the Six Nations match in Cardiff last year when they folded in the final quarter. \u201cAt half-time it could have been the Psycho horror movie,\u201d said Jones. \u201cSomeone goes for a shower, you know what\u2019s coming. We had a choice of reacting to what Wales were doing to try and put us off or stick to our game. We showed good tactical discipline and control. \u201cWe have not played our best rugby this campaign and we want to put on a performance in the final that lights up people\u2019s eyes. It will be nice to have fans back at Twickenham and we want to put a smile on their faces.\u201d England were expected to take firm control of the game in the final 25 minutes having opted for a 6-2 split on the bench in favour of forwards against a team that in the words of Pivac was down to the bare bones in the back row, but their only points in the final 30 minutes came from three Farrell penalties. \u201cIt was a frustrating game,\u201d said Farrell. \u201cIt was scrappy at times with two teams going hard at it, but nothing ever goes all your way. We stuck in the fight and having not done too well in Wales recently, it was a good performance. \u201cIt is hard to get your foot in a game which goes tit-for-tat and we were playing against a good team. What was important was that we came out on top in the big moments. When the game was there to be taken, we were ready. It was not our best performance, but we did what was needed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
