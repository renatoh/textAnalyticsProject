For the Lions to have even one hand on the prize at the end was extraordinary. It is impossible to overstate the barriers they have hurdled to compete on this tour and the shared spoils have earned them fresh respect in both hemispheres. A final tour record of P10 W5 D2 L3 and only one defeat by more than one score, is rather better than Gatland\u2019s detractors expected. Not everything was perfect; the saga of the extra six replacements was poorly handled, the lack of Scottish Test involvement was a shame and the old warm rapport on Lions tours between the squad and the travelling media has floated away into the anti-social media ether. For all the commercial rapaciousness of the modern Lions operation, however, this tour has otherwise restored faith in a noble ideal and, in Warburton, the squad had one of the all-time great ambassadors. Not even Willie John McBride captained two successive undefeated Lions squads nor bounced back from failing to make the starting XV for the first Test to deny a hugely motivated New Zealand in the last two brutal, defining games. If Jonathan Davies was a deserved winner of the players\u2019 player of the tour award, it was Warburton who made the quietly persuasive request for Romain Poite to re\u2011examine his initial decision to award New Zealand a kickable penalty in the closing moments with the scoreboard reading 15-15. Whatever the rights and wrongs of Poite\u2019s accidental offside ruling \u2013 and footage of Read a yard in front of Beauden Barrett\u2019s all-important restart further emphasises how hard it is for match officials to spot every significant offence \u2013 there was no bigger U-turn on this trip than New Zealand\u2019s failure to clinch the series from 1-0 ahead with two to play. If Gatland deserves credit for edging his battle of coaching wits with Steve Hansen, his best call may have been the reappointment of Warburton. \u201cI read a great quote from Michael Johnson which stuck with me,\u201d said Warburton, his on-field labours finally over. \u201cHe said: \u2018Pressure is just the shadow of great opportunity.\u2019 That\u2019s how I see it. Don\u2019t be afraid of what you could lose. Be excited about what you could achieve. You\u2019ve got to be brave, take chances and make things happen. When you get in the real big games, you don\u2019t want occasions to blur for players. You still want them to have a go, play with freedom and instinct.\u201d The Lions were certainly true to their pre-tour word about giving it everything. If the final body count was slightly lower than expected, the scans awaiting Sean O\u2019Brien and Johnny Sexton, both high\u2011class Test \u201canimals\u201d, before they fly home were a reminder of just how much commitment these tours require. Warburton, for example, found it difficult to address his players beforehand, so conscious was he of the magnitude of the occasion: \u201cI probably didn\u2019t say as much as I normally would because I felt very emotional before the game. You think of all sorts \u2013 my family, my little girl, my wife \u2013 and all the things you sacrifice to get here: your diet, your sleep, your lifestyle. When I chat to youngsters, I always say to them that being a professional rugby player is a lifestyle. It\u2019s not about the five or six hours you\u2019re at a training ground each day, it is what you do off the field, how you look after yourself. When you have been committed for four years and you get to a Lions series, all that effort goes into one 80-minute game. You just want to do yourself justice.\u201d He and his team-mates deserve a good rest now but the administrators negotiating the dates and itinerary for the 2021 Lions tour and beyond should be made to sit with Warburton for an hour and listen to the modern player\u2019s perspective. \u201cI know there are things that are over my head when it comes to the finances and the politics of it but from a playing perspective I would like to give my opinion,\u201d the 28-year-old said. \u201cSpeaking on behalf of the players, we\u2019d always want the Lions to happen. I am sure most players would say the Lions is the most special thing you\u2019ll do in your international career. I think it\u2019s a must the Lions should continue.\u201d New Zealanders would all echo that sentiment. There has been a relentless crackle to this series, probably more so than for any other games seen here since the 2011 World Cup. If the All Blacks were unlucky to lose both Ben Smith and Dane Coles, the Lions would have fancied making a still bigger dent had Billy Vunipola been fit. Against that New Zealand were slightly unfortunate to concede the last-minute penalty that allowed Owen Farrell to win the second Test and, but for a greasy ball, the third Test might have concluded differently too. Then again, what if Farrell\u2019s long ball had not been intercepted by Barrett on Saturday with the score at 0-0 and the Lions on the verge of seizing the initiative? It is not impossible we could have been talking 1971 all over again rather than 1955, the last time the Lions drew a series. But who are we kidding? It would be greedy to ask for more than three epic Test matches, the extraordinary long-range goal-kicking of Farrell and Elliot Daly, the electric dash of Barrett, the soaring all-round impact of Maro Itoje and Brodie Retallick, the infectious atmosphere in the stadiums and the sportsmanship of Warburton and Read. Apart from a final outright winner, the 2017 series had it all.
