Three companies have expressed their willingness to provide around \u00a315,000 over the next four months but Charvis's fear is that, if he returns from the tournament in Australia with a long-term injury, not only will he have no insurance cover for loss of earnings but his chances of landing a club contract will be almost non-existent. Charvis wants to play in the World Cup despite failing to gain a regional contract with the Neath-Swansea Ospreys. The 30-year-old, who won two Lions caps in 2001, has been training with the national team for nothing. \"I am carrying on with Wales,\" he said. \"I have spent some \u00a312,000 of my savings since being made redundant by Swansea and that figure will probably rise to \u00a315,000 by the time we leave for Australia but it is worth it. I am surprised to find myself in this position because I thought I had agreed a deal with the Ospreys.\" It was all so different for Charvis at the turn of the year. He was the Wales captain with every prospect of leading his country in Australia and his earnings from club and international rugby reached six figures, but he is now living off his savings as he prepares for the World Cup, having decided not to seek a club contract which would rule him out of the tournament. Charvis agreed a contract with the Ospreys before leaving for Wales's tour to Australia and New Zealand in June but he did not sign it. When he returned home, the offer was withdrawn with Neath-Swansea citing irreconcilable differences. As the other four regions had a full complement of back-row players, Charvis had to look outside Wales. But clubs were interested in him only if he agreed to play for them during the World Cup. \"I was shocked to learn that the offer of a contract had been withdrawn. All I wanted to do was sign for my local club and continue living in Swansea: I do not want to have to move but I might have no choice. I am still reeling from the Ospreys' decision and no one can exist on thin air. There are bills to pay but, barring the ultimate sacrifice of selling my home, I am doing everything to ensure that I will be at the World Cup.\" Charvis finished Wales's June tour in a hospital after being knocked unconscious in a jarring tackle by his opposite number Jerry Collins during the defeat against New Zealand in Hamilton and he is concerned about what will happen if he returns from Australia injured. \"My big fear is not being able to play after the World Cup,\" he said. \"I would not be covered by insurance for loss of earnings because I am not employed by anyone. Conversely I could come back from Australia and find that one of the regions has an injury crisis in the back row and is looking to sign someone on a short-term contract. I just do not know what the future holds but I am concentrating on the next four months and my focus is on making the Wales 30 for Australia.\" Charvis will earn some money in the coming months but not much if Wales continue their eight-match losing streak. They have four friendlies in the next four weeks but, with the Welsh Rugby Union slashing appearance fees and win bonuses because of the pressing financial problems which meant it was not in a position to offer Charvis a temporary contract, his country would need to win the World Cup to compensate him for his time. The Wales players are not paid for training and are all living off their regional contracts. \"A number of companies have expressed an interest in backing Colin and we are talking to them this week,\" said the Wales manager Alan Phillips. \"What has happened to him is very unfortunate and we are delighted he has committed himself to the World Cup because he is without question a world-class player.\" Charvis's agent, Peter Underhill, has had a hectic month. \"What happened with the Ospreys was unexpected,\" he said. \"Colin could have joined a club outside Wales and taken money to play for them during the World Cup but he wants to represent his country. He is a normal bloke with commitments like everyone else and what has happened to him is a travesty.\" Charvis lost the Wales captaincy after the defeat by Italy in Rome last February. A fans' website then dubbed him the second most hated man in the world after Osama bin Laden and before Saddam Hussein which prompted him to remark: \"It shows that people in Wales sometimes lose a little bit of perspective when it comes to rugby.\" It is that fanaticism that the only amateur player in Britain and Ireland preparing for the World Cup is now relying on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
