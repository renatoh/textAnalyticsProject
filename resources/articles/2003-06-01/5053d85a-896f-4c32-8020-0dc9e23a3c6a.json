The Serenade for String Trio is Dohnanyi's most popular chamber work, with four of the five movements crisply compact and undemanding, but with a Variation movement, Andante con Moto, which delves deeper on a more ambitious scale, here inspiring dedicated playing. The Sextet is even more distinctive, with a strong first movement prominently featuring the horn, and a slow movement that builds up powerfully before two lighter movements, leading up to an exuberant finale of jagged cross-rhythms, comic false entries and deliciously surreal waltz-references. It is played breathtakingly fast, with the waltz parodies wittily highlighted, and the fun of the final wrong-key cadence nicely pointed under the direction of cellist Frank Sumner Dodge. Brilliant, full-bodied sound to match."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
