Their debut single, Aie a Mwana, was released in 1981, and their hits include Cruel Summer, I Heard a Rumour, Robert de Niro\u2019s Waiting, Love in the First Degree and Venus, which was their first US number one. Their 1987 album, Wow! went to number one on the Australian ARIA charts, and the trio performed in Australia a year later as part of their world tour. In the 90s, Sara Dallin and Keren Woodward kept making music, and now they will tour Australia\u2019s capital cities with latest EP Now or Never, recorded in 2012 to celebrate their 30th anniversary. They will be joined by Wang Chung and The Chantoozies.
