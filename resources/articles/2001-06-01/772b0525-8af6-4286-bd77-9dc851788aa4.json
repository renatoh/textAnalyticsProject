Yet suddenly it is not just the reins but the whole apparatus that is being challenged - monitoring, audit, inspection...and performance targets. We are in danger of forgetting why tighter monitoring and inspection were introduced in the first place. In our schools, half of all Thatcher's children at 11 were not reaching the expected level of literacy and numeracy - adding new cohorts to the 7m adults who already could not read or add up properly. Conditions in our prisons - as successive chief inspectors have exposed - were a disgrace. Children taken into care for their own safety were being abused by state employees. There were other problems in the NHS: unacceptable wide variations, as the royal commission in 1979 - and many subsequent reports - have shown. Even when funds were earmarked for special services, such as small regional secure units for mentally disordered patients, they were never built. A 50% increase in orthopaedic surgeons reduced their productivity rather than the waiting list that drives private practice. On average, surgeons reduced NHS operations to six a week. Audit has produced genuine progress. Take some of the audit commission's key reports: on day surgery (which helped the NHS treat many thousands of extra patients); on \"mis-spent youth\", which led to the reform of juvenile justice; and on the police, which exposed their inefficiencies. The commission is a good example of how monitoring has changed. It began looking at inefficiencies; moved on to measuring performance; progressed to inspection; and is now focusing on users. Yet even the monitors recognise their trade could still be improved. There are 15 different external agencies now monitoring health - against 18 different sets of standards. From running some of the most unmonitored services, the UK has become among the most scrutinised. The commission for health improvements (CHI) has recognised the problem, as has the audit commission. Indeed, even ministers reduced performance targets and introduced service delivery agreements instead. What should happen now? If the future is \"delivery, delivery, delivery\" then independent audit and inspection become even more important - along with better management. There is nothing new about joint inspections, but we need more of them. And there is just one front, where there is still too little external monitoring: at the centre where traditionally management has always been weak."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
