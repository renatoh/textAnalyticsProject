It was the Seattle Reign striker\u2019s second goal from open play since Phil Neville became England manager but it was enough to consign Argentina to a 1-0 defeat in Le Havre on Friday, guaranteeing the Lionesses a place in the knockout rounds. Injuries have played their part but Taylor, winner of the Golden Boot at Euro 2017 in the Netherlands, has frequently seemed possibly the biggest casualty of Neville\u2019s continuing switch from the more direct, counterattacking style used by his predecessor, Mark Sampson, to a possession-monopolising, patient passing game. As Neville said in Le Havre on Friday night, Taylor is a striker who \u201cthrives on through balls\u201d and she \u201chas not had the service she had before\u201d with England. He also appreciates that the 33-year-old, on loan at Melbourne City, is an instinctive finisher who comes to life in the biggest games. It is why he says he is \u201cworking very hard\u201d on accommodating her potentially tournament-winning strengths in his gameplans. Arguably the biggest challenge confronting England\u2019s manager is to sustain his team\u2019s stylistic evolution without forfeiting the very real, if slightly less easy on the eye, strengths that swept the Lionesses to the final four of the last two major tournaments. On a night when Argentina defended in depth, their goalkeeper Vanina Correa seemed to be wearing magnetic gloves and Nikita Parris had an early penalty saved, it was perhaps significant that Taylor\u2019s second-half winner stemmed from a rapid counterattack following a rare South American attack. In a blink of an eye she had ghosted into space, connected with Beth Mead\u2019s stellar first-time cross and proved Correa was human after all. It left England needing only a draw with Japan on Wednesday night in Nice to top Group D and enjoy, theoretically at least, a straightforward passage to the semi-finals, where they are likely to meet either France or the United States in Lyon. Taylor celebrated with the intensity of a striker ending a long goal drought but said she had not really been doing anything different in the past 14 months. \u201cIt didn\u2019t really weigh on my mind because it\u2019s the same process whether you score or not,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re still trying to be in the right place at the right time. A lot of it comes down to the service and I\u2019m the first to admit I score because of my teammates. \u201cWhen we reached the semi-finals of Euro 2017 I won the Golden Boot because of their quality. It\u2019s all about that quality in the final third. I think the ball from Beth Mead shows that \u2013 it was such a good delivery from Beth and I was in the right place to time my run and put it in the back of the net. It\u2019s just so nice to score at major tournaments. It\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. It\u2019s brilliant.\u201d Coincidentally, Mead and Taylor are roommates in France but their friendship is typical of the wider camaraderie among Neville\u2019s squad. \u201cI do believe the closer you are as a team the better your performance will be on the pitch,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cYou\u2019re more likely to work harder for each other, to show belief in each other and encourage each other. We\u2019ve got a really good togetherness.\u201d Important as their new-found desire to keep the ball and build from the back could well prove against the leading teams, such as France and the USA, the buildup to Taylor\u2019s goal possibly also emphasised that the Lionesses\u2019 enduring ability to turn hybrid, mix things up and break down opponents in different ways could yet prove one of their strongest suits. Philosophy and principles are all very well but sometimes a little compromise and pragmatism are required to balance the equation. \u201cWe have to be a team that can bring a bit of everything,\u201d emphasised Mead. \u201cWe\u2019re heading in the right direction, we\u2019re gaining momentum and it feels like we\u2019re progressing but there are also things we need to work on. \u201cThere are things we have to improve but we also have to remember the things we are good at. It\u2019s about having the whole package. We also \u2013 apart from passing fluently \u2013 want to be known as a physical team, a hard team to play against. We\u2019re not going to roll over, we\u2019re never going to pull out of a 50-50 challenge. We have to be able to do a bit of everything.\u201d Neville certainly appreciates Taylor\u2019s abilities. \u201cShe\u2019s a massive player, a big-game player. I told Jodie before the game I knew she would score. After the Scotland game [the 2-1 victory in which Taylor was an unused substitute] her training performances, her attitude, the way that she has focused, we told Jodie very early on that she would be playing against Argentina. \u201cYou reap your rewards from your training performances and that is what we saw from Jodie. She thrives off service, off balls through and the support from around her. \u201c And I think in my time as manager, I have to say probably we\u2019ve not given her the service she had in the Euros or past games for England, and it\u2019s something we\u2019re working really hard on.\u201d So far, so good but it seems Neville still has some blending to do."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
