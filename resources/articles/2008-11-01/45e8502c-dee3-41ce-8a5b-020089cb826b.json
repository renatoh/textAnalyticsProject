Studs Terkel, the greatest English language oral historian of our age, was one of those men. He seemed immortal, seemed like he'd always be there in his Chicago radio studio, ready to meet someone new, to discuss the state of the world with them in his wonderful, gritty, voice. His hospitality, his generosity with younger writers and journalists, was legendary. But of course, he was, in reality, a mortal. And on Friday afternoon Studs died, at the grand age of 96. Like Bertrand Russell, Pablo Casals, Picasso, and Arthur Rubinstein, he thus joined the list of modern cultural icons who exited the scene just shy of their centenaries. And like them all, he remained an extraordinary presence until the end of his life. I'll hazard a guess that hundreds of years from now, Terkel, the son of Jewish immigrants to the New World, and a lifelong, unapologetic progressive, will continue to be viewed as one of the great interpreters of our era. He will be included in the cultural pantheon as one of the most extraordinary chroniclers of America, and, as important, the oft-unrealised possibilities inherent in American democracy. Terkel interpreted 20th and early 21st century America in much the same way, and eliciting much the same eye-opening responses, as the journalist Henry Mayhew did mid-Victorian London and its labouring poor. His raw material was memory, but what he did with memory was pure art. It seems to me that I've always known of Terkel. Way back when I was a teenager, I picked up a secondhand hardback copy of his book American Dreams Lost &amp; Found and was instantly hooked. \"I never could take orders,\" one middle-aged photographer told him. \"I'm an old-fashioned craftsman. I like to do it my own way. I can't take criticism too much. Even though it's deserved, I can't stand it. So I borrowed some money and built my own place. Yeah, it's an American Dream. A man that builds from the bottom, builds something up and makes it work.\" He could have been describing the country itself. And from the owner of a general store in a small Appalachian village in eastern Kentucky: People here in Appalachia have been poor for a hundred thirty years. We have about ninety thousand people in these four counties that's under thirty-six hundred dollars a year. I'm talkin' about dirt-poor people. Many's on welfare and got black lung and emphysema. Some of 'em can't hear. They're good people, honest people, and they have worked awful hard all their lives. You can practically feel the ghastly, claustrophobic, poverty of Appalachia crashing down on you as you read. His interviews with men and women, famous and utterly unknown, on topics ranging from the meaning of the American Dream to racial identity, from the Great Depression and the second world war through to interpretations of the 20th century, were breathtaking both in their ambition and their simplicity. Terkel sought to weave grand historical narratives through recovering the memories and verbal mannerisms of hundreds of people. His questions probed and prodded. His voice and his demeanor drew his subjects in, and as they got more comfortable so their words began to paint pictures. Terkel recorded his interviews, broadcast them on his radio show, collected them into books, and, most recently, posted hundreds of them on his website. Terkel was one of the reasons I became a journalist. He set a bar that could never be reached, but one that anyone who's read his books knows is all too worth stretching toward. I daresay thousands of other writers and journalists both in America and overseas were similarly influenced by him during their formative years. Three weeks ago, when I asked my UC-Davis writing students to go online and listen to some of his interviews on the Great Depression, they came back to class the next week brimming over with excitement at what they'd heard. Like the Beatles, he was one of those rare creatures whose work seems to remain perennially young and relevant. In the grimmest of times, Terkel remained an optimist. One of his recent books was titled Hope Dies Last. A product of the New Deal years, a time when government power was generally used wisely and for the public good, he never stopped believing that America would one day again live up to its potential. Just one week before his death, in an interview in the Huffington Post, he expressed his tremendous excitement at the possibility of Obama being elected president. \"It's a long haul. It's step by step,\" Studs wrote in the introduction to Hope Dies Last, published when he was 91 years old. \"As Mahalia Jackson sang out, 'We're on our way' \u2013 not to Cannon Land, perhaps, but to the world as a better place than it has been before.\" When I cast my vote on Tuesday morning, I'll send up a silent greeting to a friend I never got to meet. \"Studs, this one's for you.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
