Pack off six spoilt young Brits to the developing world hellholes where their creature comforts are made. Not just to watch, but to do it for themselves: getting involved in manufacturing the luxury mobile phones, trainers and jewellery they take for granted. So here they are in Madagascar, mining sapphires. Do that many young British people really have sapphires? It doesn't matter, Ilakaka is a perfect place to take them, a ramshackle town full of desperate people searching for their fortunes: lots of danger and not a single flushing loo. And out on the edge of town there is an actual hellhole \u2013 a huge pit, dug in the red soil by human chains of men with shovels. Very Old Testament. Oh my God, our young heroes say, collectively. But there's not really time for OMGs. They need to get down and dirty. Of course, they moan and faint, get blisters and backache and drop out. The ones who can't take the heat at the open-cast mine are taken to a more traditional shaft, and lowered into the darkness. But this one is built with the slimline African miner in mind, not the well nourished European. They get stuck and have panic attacks and have to be winched back up, white and trembling. It must be hard though, mining in Madagascar, when normally you'd be shopping in Harrogate. To be fair, they do give it a proper go. They want to be able to help, even if physically they're not really in a position to do so. At least they're interested, ask questions, get involved. And they have a collective moment of realisation: oh my God, the world is totally so unfair. One of them even has a pop at the European gem dealer for making all the money while the guys at the mines do all the work for a pound a day. Go girl \u2013 at him! And once you get past their Veruca Saltishness, which is piled on for the cameras, they're actually kind of nice. I felt quite proud of them. And very entertaining it is too; I think all young Brits should be sent down mines, preferable African ones. And so to Afghanistan, a country that, because of a certain recent regime's reticence to the idea, is relatively new to the whole phenomenon of the TV talent contest. There's so much potential too \u2013 Afghanistan's Got Taliban, Dancing on IEDs, Afghanistan's Next Top Mullah, How to Solve a Problem Like Sharia . . . But they're still at the early stages: Afghan Star (More4) is like the original Pop Idol. What they lack in experience, though, they certainly make up for in passion. It's at another level out there. There's the whole tribal thing for a start. I know we have a bit of that here but, with respect to the people of Birmingham and Newcastle, being a Pashtun seems to mean even more than being a Brummie or a Geordie. Then there's the W Factor \u2013 W meaning women, who a lot of people still believe should be wrapped up. Singing women is one thing, but when they start dancing, which is what a woman called Setara did \u2013 well, it's still about 1,000 years too early for that. Death threats all round. Now that they've discovered the TV talent show, they can maybe settle their differences that way, with a microphone instead of the RPG and the Kalashnikov. In fact, that's what we should do: recall all our troops immediately and send Simon Cowell out there instead. Except he'd probably be more expensive. Olympic Dreams (BBC1) has been interesting. It's incredible how focused and single-minded you have to be, and how hard you have to train, even to think about going to the Olympics, let alone standing on any rostrums. I worry about some of them, like young Olivia who's left school \u2013 where she was studying maths, biology, art and drama \u2013 in order to have a go. Her sport? Well, is it even a sport? It's synchronised swimming! So she's given up everything in order to put on a lot of make-up, get wet, and become a national joke. What would they make of synchronised swimming in Afghanistan, I wonder."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
