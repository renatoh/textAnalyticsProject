Barry Elson, a veteran of the US cable industry who joined the company in November, will become acting chief executive. Mr Elson will also step up from chairman of new US-listed holding company Telewest Global Inc to become its chief executive, a role Mr Burdick was expected to have filled. Mr Burdick has run Telewest as group managing director since July 2002, stepping up after five years as the company's finance director when Adam Singer was ousted in a boardroom coup. He is also quitting the company's board, but will remain available as a consultant until Telewest completes its restructuring - which will see 98.5% of the group's shares swapped for \u00a33.5bn of its debt. He is likely to leave with a payoff equivalent to his annual salary of \u00a3500,000. \"I want to thank everyone, especially the Telewest management team, for helping me lead the company through this difficult period of financial and operational restructuring,\" he said. \"I have enjoyed my time at the company; but it is a time of change, and I am leaving to pursue other opportunities. I have no doubt that Barry will do a great job.\" Mr Elson, who spent nearly 14 years at US cable and telephony giant Cox Communications ending up as executive vice president of operations, said Mr Burdick had created a \"strong platform to build on\". Mr Burdick's departure also means that the Telewest chairman, Cob Stenham, will go on to chair Telewest Global when it is launched after the restructuring process. Mr Stenham, who was to have become chairman emeritus, will be the only member of the existing Telewest board to become a director of Telewest Global. Stephen Cook is to stand down as a director when the restructuring process is over, but will remain as a general counsel and group strategy director for Telewest Global. Denise Kingsmill and Anthony Rice are also leaving at the close of the restructuring. In November, another director, Stanislas Yassukovich, announced his departure from the board in protest at changes to the restructuring deal, while finance director Mark Luiz left in August. The changes in personnel at the group in recent months come as negotiations between the company and its bondholders reach a climax. The influential bondholder Bill Huff, a New Jersey-based fund manager, has two representatives on the proposed nine-man board of Telewest Global. Like its rival NTL, Telewest was forced to restructure its finances to avoid going bust after investing heavily in buying and upgrading cable networks at the height of the market. NTL and Telewest are widely expected to merge in an attempt to take on the might of pay-TV giant BSkyB, which has raced ahead in the battle for subscribers. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
