Patients' representatives said the health service could not justify providing a \"Rolls-Royce\" service for about 300 footmen, maids and other members of the royal household when it was closing larger practices available to the general public on the grounds that they were uneconomically small. A financial breakdown of the funding arrangements for the palace surgery was disclosed by the Health Service Journal. It said the Buckingham Palace practice received the equivalent of \u00a3113 per patient in 2007-08, compared with a national average of \u00a363. The surgery is run by the Queen's GP, Timothy Evans, but the monarch does not attend the surgery, as members of the royal family prefer to be treated privately. All practices are able to set boundaries to exclude patients who do not live or work within a catchment area. The journal said the royal surgery was able to deny access to the general public by setting its boundary to coincide precisely with the railings around the palace. Its list of 304 patients contrasts with an average practice of about 6,000. The palace practice's annual income from the NHS has more than doubled since the GP contract was amended in 2004 to include a minimum income guarantee and bonuses for excellent service. Vanessa Bourne, of the Patients Association, said: \"We have been making representations on behalf of patients registered with a single-handed practice in Mayfair. The primary care trust wanted to close it for being too small. It wasn't just for millionaires. It provided care for staff at the Park Lane hotels. Older patients were told to switch to other practices across busy roads that were unsafe to cross. How on Earth can they justify a tiny practice exclusively for Buckingham Palace staff?\" The journal said similar bespoke on-site services were provided by the NHS for staff and pupils at the fee-paying Westminster school and Haileybury school, Hertfordshire. A palace spokesman referred inquiries about the surgery to the Department of Health. A department spokeswoman said it was not responsible for commissioning the service and referred questions to Westminster primary care trust, where relevant officials were not available to give a comment. Andrew Mackinlay, Labour MP for Thurrock, has tabled a series of parliamentary questions on the issue but has been stonewalled by the government. In a written answer on March 26, Ben Bradshaw, the health minister, said: \"The department is not aware of any special provision for primary health care service to staff of the royal households.\" Paul Jenkins, acting chief executive of Westminster PCT, said the GP contracts for the Buckingham Palace and Westminster school surgeries dated back many years. \"Their overall contract costs are minimal and do not include other significant payments typical for GP practices, such as reimbursements of premises rent and rates. \"Local residents in the area have a multiple choice of family doctors to register with,\" he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
