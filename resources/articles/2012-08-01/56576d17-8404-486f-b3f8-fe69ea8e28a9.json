Taekwondo is its name and the extraordinary enthusiasm generated by the trail-blazing Jade Jones has rivalled anything seen outside the mainstream events at these Games. Deliberately kicking people in the head has never been so popular. By winning a memorable gold medal in the featherweight 57kg category, against the double Chinese world champion Hou Yuzhuo, Jones triumphantly sealed Britain's best showing in taekwondo in Olympic history. Martin Stamper could not quite make it an astounding double in the men's 68kg category but his agonising defeat in the bronze final also made for compelling viewing. Aside from Sarah Stevenson's bronze in Beijing four years ago, GB has never previously made it on to the podium. It is already thrillingly evident that the 19-year-old Jones is a genuine star, from her protective helmet to her flying toenails. The girl from Flintshire in north Wales has already seen off the world No1, Tseng Li-cheng from Chinese Taipei and could just be the catalyst for an explosion in martial arts interest. Never has there been a more appropriate moment to re-issue Teenage Kicks by The Undertones. Jones had to show all the mental fortitude for which she is renowned to see off Hou 6-4, twice suffering painful knocks in a tense second round. The early signs had been ominous, too, the youngster contriving to leave her blue helmet behind as she rushed forward to face her opponent. She had to have it tossed up to her from the apron prior to the start of the first round, which was a cagey, scoreless affair. Her positivity, however, was gradually rewarded as Hou, who had narrowly beaten Jones to silver in last year's world championships, grew increasingly frustrated. The Chinese conceded two penalty points, and a storming final round from Wales's angelic-looking assassin duly completed the job. As she hurled her helmet skywards and ran around the ring waving the Welsh dragon as well as the union flag, the sense of ecstasy was not confined to those watching in the pubs and clubs of Flint. \"It feels crazy,\" gasped the champion. \"To be the first athlete to win Olympic gold is amazing.\" These have certainly been the Games for strong, inspirational women. Not for nothing is Jones known as \"The Headhunter\", a nickname which has nothing to do with her abilities in the field of City recruitment. It was coined by her fellow players at the British taekwondo academy in Manchester two years ago when her aggressive instincts became swiftly apparent. \"Everyone used to laugh because I rarely went to the body and nearly always kicked to the head,\" she said. Her coach, Paul Green, says he feels sympathy for some of her opponents. \"She's like a male athlete in the female department,\" said Green. \"She's been getting up at 6am, tears every day but she's a fighter and she works hard. She's still got improvements to make but the future's bright for her. She delivers under pressure.\" The spectacular final round of her semi-final which saw Jones overcome her more fancied opponent was another classic example. Trailing 2-1 after the first two rounds, she needed something special and, with fewer than 30 seconds left, duly produced it with a snaking head-high right foot to the temple of her startled opponent. The three-pointer took her in front and the final score of 10-6 prompted a flurry of triumphant fist-pumping. The adrenaline rush the sport offers had attracted her right from the outset. When she was eight her grandfather took her along to the local taekwondo club to encourage her to defend herself and \"just to keep me off the streets really\". The school bullies were soon routed and her profile is now rising steadily. Last year she won silver in the 2011 world championships in South Korea. She had earlier convincingly seen off Japan's Mayu Hamada in the quarter-finals prior to emerging as only the third Welsh women to win Olympic gold. The 25-year-old Stamper, from Liverpool, also did his country proud, having previously defeated Erick Osornio Nunez from Mexico and Damir Fejzic of Serbia. Blocking his path to the gold medal match, however, was the top-seeded Servet Tazegul of Turkey, a bronze medallist in Beijing, who took an early lead and withstood a furious late comeback to win 9-6. It was still enough to earn Stamper his bronze-medal shot against Afghanistan's Rohullah Nikpah, who became his country's first Olympic medallist four years ago. A tight contest hinged on a video referral two seconds from the end but Stamper's hopes of a last-gasp victory were dashed by the judges. The crowd, though, loved every second. Taekwondo lends itself to a gladiatorial atmosphere, although the Koreans believe the use of physical force is justified only through defence. The gritty Jones stretches that principle to its limit. She has certainly reinforced Stevenson's belief that British taekwondo has never been in a better place despite the adverse headlines generated by the contentious exclusion from the GB Olympic squad of the world No1, Aaron Cook. \"When I went to Sydney in 2000 hardly anyone knew what taekwondo was,\" she said this week. \"That's all changed...I don't even think you can class it as a so-called minority sport any more.\" Stevenson and Cook's replacement, Lutalo Muhammad, the European champion, are both in action on Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
