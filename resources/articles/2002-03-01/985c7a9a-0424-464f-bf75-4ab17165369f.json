Since September 11 the western press has had no scope for anything other than a passing glance at the progress of talks between the army government and the democratic leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, and the activities of Burma's drug barons in the Golden Triangle. But even in quieter times, the lot of the ordinary Burmese people - as well as the Shan, Kayan, Palaung and Wa, to list just a few of the country's bewildering array of ethnic groups - has remained largely unreported. In the tradition of Gavin Young and Nigel Barley, Andrew Marshall wrote his book around a journey in the footsteps of an intriguing historical figure: Sir James George Scott, one of 19th-century Britain's most colourful and scholarly adventurers, who wrote extensively about the country. Along the way the author offers a heart-rending view of what life holds for those in the grip of Burma's military dictatorship. His passing comments on the minefield that is current Burmese politics might leave the military men of Myanmar (the Burmese army's official name for their country) cringing - not least a description of Khin Nyunt, the de facto chief, as \"Burma's Poo Bah, Big Brother and (it was rumoured) most prominent closet homosexual\". Marshall, a British journalist based in Bangkok, has a wry, often funny take on things that makes his observations all the more poignant. On the face of it The Trouser People appears to be a jolly romp through a former colony, ostensibly hand in hand with Scott, who on his adventures introduced football to Burma. Yet fans of soccer history will be disappointed. Marshall peppers his book with football anecdotes where he can, but you get the impression that the soccer theme was something of an afterthought to create a catchy selling line. As Marshall respectfully acknowledges, the Victorian footballer was far more than a sports enthusiast. Scott, originally from Fife, found work as a teacher in Rangoon, where he organised Burma's first football matches. The Burmese teams wore their sarong-like lungyis tucked up around their thighs \"like a large decorative nappy\", while the British sported trousers - hence the title of Marshall's book. Scott went on to develop considerable skills as a journalist, photographer, war correspondent and wily administrator of Empire business - as well as enviable abilities as a linguist. As a reporter, he visited Mandalay shortly before the British invasion of Upper Burma in 1885. Here he attended an audience with King Thibaw (the subject of Amitav Ghosh's recent novel The Glass Palace ). Scott recorded the event with typical acumen and pithy flourishes. He later joined the colonial service and was primarily engaged in the \"pacification\" of the Shan states, which involved extensive travel among diverse tribal peoples as well as shrewd negotiation with the Shan princes. His greatest act of derring-do was venturing into the territory of the headhunting Wa. All of which provides Marshall with excellent cause to set off on his own adventures - including encounters with the United Wa State Army, today more dependent on heroin than on heads. But it is as an author and perceptive diarist that George Scott presents Marshall with his richest source material. The Burman, His Life and Notions , published in 1882 under Scott's Burmese pseudonym Shway Yoe, is a classic, still widely regarded as a must-read for anyone with more than a passing interest in the country. His Gazetteer of Upper Burma and the Shan States (lovingly lugged around Burma by Marshall) took more than 10 years to compile. It is a weighty masterpiece of observation, chronicling the extraordinary cultures of the hill peoples. Weaving such a wealth of information into a contemporary account of the county cannot have been an easy task. Yet Marshall has produced an immensely readable book, offering a different perspective to other recent Burma travelogues such as Rory Maclean's Under the Dragon: Travels in a Betrayed Land and Shelby Tucker's Among the Insurgents: Walking Through Burma . He makes light of his own escapades and provides, above all, an unsentimental expos\u00e9 of the craziness and cruelty that is Burma today.
