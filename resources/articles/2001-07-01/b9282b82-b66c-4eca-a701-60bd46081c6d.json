Shoppers splurged on soft drinks, ice cream and strawberries during last month's hot weather, driving up sales of goods by 7.8% on June 2000, the British Retail Consortium said. In recent years, consumers have tended to benefit from early and aggressive discounting by retailers struggling to cope with the twin effects of weak demand and poor weather. Amanda Aldridge, head of retail at KPMG, said: \"The sales have started later this year as retailers have sold more at full price and in some cases have had to buy in stock for the sales.\" British manufacturers have so far been unable to cash in on the consumer boom, with profit margins continuing to be squeezed. Factory gate prices were 0.4% higher last month than a year earlier, the slowest annual rate of increase for more than two years, according to the office for national statistics. With the slowdown in world demand and the strength of the pound preventing firms from passing on to customers a 2.6% annual increase in their fuel and raw material costs, the core producer price index, which strips out the impact of budget changes on food, tobacco and petroleum prices, was up by only 0.2% on the year. Officials said that the real cost pressures on industry were probably even higher as a result of the climate change levy, which was introduced in April. The Department of Trade and Industry estimates that the new charge - which has yet to be included in the producer prices index - may have boosted the price of materials and fuel for producers by an extra 1%. Financial services firms are beginning to share the pain of their manufacturing counterparts, according to a survey by the Confederation of British Industry and PricewaterhouseCoopers, which shows profitability in the sector falling for the first time in six years. \"We've seen the business confidence of financial services firms stabilise this quarter, after slipping back earlier in the year,\" said John Hitchins, financial services partner at PwC. \"But, because overall profitability has seen its first decline for six years, it's clear this is a reflection of less turbulence in the market rather than an improvement in underlying fundamentals.\" Recent redundancies at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sac show that City firms are suffering particularly badly, squeezed by falling share prices and the collapse of the dot.com boom, while consumer borrowing buoys up the business of retail financial services. \"Building societies and general insurers reported sharp rises in volumes,\" the CBI said, \"while securities traders, fund managers, and banks reported significant falls over the past three months.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
