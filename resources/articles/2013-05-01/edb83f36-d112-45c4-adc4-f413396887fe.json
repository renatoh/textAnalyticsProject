The coalition was accused of spoiling tactics after it responded to a call for heterosexual couples to be granted the same rights to enter into civil partnerships by announcing plans for a review that would be delayed for five years once the legislation is passed. The review could mean that civil partnerships are extended to all couples \u2013 or scrapped altogether. David Cameron, who is bracing himself for another bumpy week after the \"rebellion\" over an EU referendum, has issued instructions to ministers to avoid any pitfalls next week. The government stepped in amid fears that an amendment designed to give straight couples the right to civil partnerships, planned by Tim Loughton, the former children's minister, and two other Tory MPs, could disrupt the equal marriage bill, which is opposed by many Conservatives. Peter Tatchell criticised No 10's move. The gay rights activist told Gay Star News: \"The government's decision to oppose the legalisation of civil partnerships for heterosexual couples is hugely disappointing. It is a sad betrayal of the principle of equality. I hope a majority of MPs will rebel and next week vote for the parliamentary amendment to open up civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples.\" Chris Bryant, the shadow home office minister, tweeted: \"I hear govt policy on civil partnerships for opposite sex couples is collapsing.\" The Loughton amendment fell into this category. Loughton is an unlikely political partner of Tatchell because he voted against the second reading of the equal marriage bill. A government spokesman said: \"Civil partnerships were created for a very specific reason \u2013 to give same-sex couples access to legal rights at a time when society was not ready to give them access to marriage. Now that the time is right to extend marriage to same-sex couples, it is also right we should consider the future of civil partnerships. \"There are strong views on both sides of this debate, and we have listened to those views. A proper review will allow us to look at the issues in a considered and thorough way, giving full consideration to implications of any changes.\" Earlier this week the culture secretary, Maria Miller, resisted calls for civil partnerships to be extended to heterosexual couples, expressing concern that to include the issue in the legislation would lead to a significant delay in its implementation, and could incur considerable costs. In a statement, Miller She said: \"The equal marriage bill is about extending marriage to same-sex couples. Questions have been raised about whether we should also extend civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples. We are therefore offering the house the opportunity to have a review of this area, rather than legislating now without the required evidence.\" Miller, questioned by the joint human rights committee on Tuesday, appeared clear that extending civil partnerships was not a preferred option. \"We don't feel there is either a necessity or a requirement to open up civil partnerships to heterosexuals because there is no deficit there \u2013 there is no lack of an ability to be able to formalise a relationship in a legal way,\" she said then. \"It is already there for heterosexual couples. It's called marriage.\" Asked about people who might not wish to marry because of their beliefs, including those who saw marriage as oppressive to women and born out of a patriarchal system, she told the committee she did not see why it would oppress women any more than men. \"Having been married for 23 years, I don't feel oppressed myself, but I can understand that people will have different views,\" she said. Miller had acknowledged that the abolition of civil partnerships would discriminate against same-sex couples who for certain reasons, including religion, did not wish to marry. Any review would take place after same-sex marriages have had a chance to become established. A period of five years is suggested so the effect of extending marriage to same-sex couples can be assessed and the government can ensure it has a proper understanding of the implications of various options. Church of England representatives claimed some amendments tabled to the gay marriage bill risked opening the door to pagan, humanist and other forms of marriage. Sir Tony Baldry, representing the church estate commissioners, said the proposal would completely change the legal basis for marriage in England. He added that MPs would have to take a view \"as to whether having heterosexual civil partnerships is or is not going to enhance the concept of marriage\". Tatchell said: \"David Cameron and Maria Miller should stop delaying and making excuses. They say their support for gay marriage is based on a commitment to equality, yet they are refusing to support equal civil partnerships for heterosexual couples. They're not being consistent.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
