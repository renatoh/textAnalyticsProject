The driving forces behind the new team are the American engineer Ken Anderson and British formula one broadcaster Peter Windsor, himself a former manager of the Williams formula one team. It is likely that the team will be based close to Charlotte, North Carolina. Anderson confirmed to the Charlotte Observer and the That'sRacing.com website that \"95 per cent of what you might have seen\" about such plans is correct. Max Mosley, the FIA president, said the team are to be taken seriously. \"They are serious people but they are the same as everyone else, they need the costs to come down if they are to be competitive,\" he said. \"They are recommended by Nick Craw, our man in the States who knows a lot of people. You have to take it seriously.\" The first US formula one team was the Scarab operation, founded and funded by Lance Reventlow, the millionaire son of the Woolworths heiress Barbara Hutton, in 1960. The cars, though beautifully engineered, were out of date before they ever raced. In 1967 the American driver Dan Gurney won the Belgian grand prix in an Eagle-Weslake and between 1974 and 1976 the Penske and Vel's Parnelli Jones formula one teams mounted a serious challenge. In 1976 John Watson won the Austrian grand prix in a Penske but Mario Andretti's formula one career was badly disrupted when the Parnelli squad withdrew after only a handful of races that same season. Andretti at least went on to become only the second US driver in history to win the world championship in 1978, matching the achievement of Phil Hill 17 years earlier."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
