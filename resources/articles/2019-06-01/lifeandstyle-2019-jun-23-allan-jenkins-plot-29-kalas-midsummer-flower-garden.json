It is close to her birthday and we are preparing her midsummer garden as we do every year. There are already clematis, mad amounts of jasmine, cascading roses, lolling lavender. It is a heady, sweet-smelling spot in London\u2019s Kentish Town. We are here to sow her annuals and I\u2019ve been hoarding seed like a kid collecting cards. Kala\u2019s is a smallish terrace townhouse garden with fairly poor soil and visiting cats. But it grows well. Last year there was a nasturtium explosion, which invaded her anxious neighbour\u2019s garden. It was mostly my fault. I have been gathering seed since early spring without restraint. She is my daughter and I love her and want her garden to be swimming in colour. She smiles, but eyes me a little warily. We have been here before. Every year. I am armed with more poppy packets, classic red from the Eden Project and an oriental from Franchi. She has lots saved from last year and more have self-seeded: in pots, in cracks in the concrete, all along the fence. I am new to sowing zinnias and have overexcitedly bought multiple styles from multiple suppliers. There are tagetes, calendula, of course, cornflowers and lots of shades of cosmos. There are sunflowers in reds and golds and \u2018Vanilla Ice\u2019 from Higgledy Garden, the Seed Co-operative, and other favoured suppliers. Kala has been clearing all day so we scatter seed like field workers, spreading wildflowers, fritillaries, bee-friendly mixes. We stop for tea and chocolate biscuits. I spread another handful of seed while Kala is not looking. I want to wrap her in abundance, have her live a riot of colour. Soon enough we are done. We will see her summer garden from our window.
