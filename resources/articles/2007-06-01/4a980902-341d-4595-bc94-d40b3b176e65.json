Eriksson, out of work since the World Cup last year, has indicated that he is ready to return to football and sources close to the deal confirmed last night that he was now the \"hot favourite\" to be named as manager. Eriksson met Thaksin's advisers yesterday, after an initial meeting in London on Sunday, and has been identified as the leading candidate once the former Thai prime minister's takeover is complete. A formal takeover offer is anticipated before the end of the week, possibly in the next 24 hours, and Thaksin's position does not appear to have been irreparably damaged by the current investigations into corruption and fraud from his time in government. If, as expected, Thaksin takes control, the new regime expects to unveil Eriksson as the club's first non-British manager, having promised him about \u00a350m in the transfer market. The talks are said to have gone well and the only potential stumbling block appears to be the Swede's wage demands. Eriksson, who is still on the Football Association's payroll almost a year after stepping down as England's head coach, has always had a high opinion of his value and City will look elsewhere if he makes \"ludicrous\" demands. Thaksin, whose personal fortune is estimated at \u00a32bn, will be able to make Eriksson one of the highest-paid managers in the Premiership. A bigger problem, however, might be convincing City's supporters that Eriksson is the right man for the job. His professional reputation has been at a low ebb since the end of his reign with England and City's current board would not have entertained the idea of bringing him in but for Thaksin's intervention. Inviting him to replace Stuart Pearce would constitute a huge gamble, particularly given the scale of the rebuilding job that is necessary, and the club's long-suffering fans are bound to be sceptical after his numerous failures in charge of the national team. \"The supporters are 70-30 against Eriksson,\" Heidi Pickup, of the Manchester City Supporters' Trust, said last night. \"He has a good record at club level but you cannot ignore all his mistakes with England. You would also have to ask whether he still has what it takes at club level because it's been several years since he last worked as a club manager. Personally I would be disappointed. The whole situation smacks of desperation.\" Privately the club's directors might sympathise with those remarks because there is strong opposition to Eriksson's appointment in the boardroom. Thaksin's advisers at the stockbrokers Seymour Pierce, led by the former Football League chairman Keith Harris, had initially identified the former Chelsea manager Claudio Ranieri, only for delays in the takeover process to allow Juventus to steal in ahead of them. The support for Ranieri within the City hierarchy was minimal, and Eriksson has even fewer admirers. To put it into context, he was the subject of ridicule only a few weeks ago. Alistair Mackintosh, the club's chief executive, had been pinning his hopes on trying to tempt Juande Ramos away from Sevilla but it is a measure of how close Thaksin is to completing his takeover that the Thai now appears to have taken charge of the recruitment process. His determination to buy into English football has not diminished even though an anti-corruption committee in Thailand has frozen 28 of his bank accounts, worth \u00a3953m. Thaksin, who was deposed as prime minister by a military junta last September, learned yesterday that he has been charged with concealing assets and has been ordered to return to Thailand by June 29 or face arrest. He is currently in exile in London and has no intention of returning, his priority being to conclude his long-awaited takeover and then make Eriksson the club's 11th manager in 10 years. City return for pre-season training on July 4 and the club want confirmation from Eriksson as quickly as possible so that they can set about rebuilding the team for what promises to be a season of high intrigue."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
