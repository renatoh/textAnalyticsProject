He said the war in Iraq was a crucial factor, but he insisted the general election would be fought on the battleground of public services. \"People like those policies,\" he told BBC Radio 2. \"But they didn't judge this election on that. Iraq was a cloud, or indeed a shadow, over these elections. I am not saying we haven't had a kicking. It's not a great day for Labour.\" The home secretary, David Blunkett, said: \"I have not come on to Today to do the usual party propaganda. I am mortified that we are not doing better than we have done. We know it has been a bad night but we are obviously going to have to present the facts as they are. \"The equivalent elections four years ago saw Tories get over 39% . On that night we did better than we did yesterday. We got 6.7% fewer votes than they did. A bad night for us but not a take-off from the Tories. They have not even got the undercarriage down. They are not even across the Atlantic, or dare I say the English channel. \"Partially, as Tony Blair acknowledged a few days ago, Iraq has damaged us ... that is reality of politics. \"You can get these major emotional changes...Some people found it was the wrong policy. It split families, it split the Labour party and split friends. \"Moods, emotions [affect] the way that people vote, particularly when they know they are not going to change the government and destroy the investment in health, education and tackling crime, under a Labour government. They voted on the feelings they have. \"I am not putting it as an excuse but there are really profound issues with reengagement with the electorate about how they see politics and politicians. \"I do not think the Tony Blair era is at an end ....\" Liam Fox, the Conservative party chairman, said: \"You have to look at the areas where we have gained councils this time. We have suffered as being seen as the party of rural England ... some of the councils we have not had since the 1980s. It has been a very long time since the Tories have controlled [metropolitan] councils like this. It is worth pointing out that the gap between the Tories and Labour is the biggest lead we have had over Labour since John Major won in 1992. \"The fact that we did well in Trafford shows we are beginning to get our lead back in the north-west, and we doubled our seats in Sunderland. We have also been taking seats from the Liberal Democrats in Harrogate and Eastbourne. It is worth pointing out that is not just the size of votes in the election but it is also the gap. \"This is the worst performance by a governing party in electoral history ... I am not saying the result today would guarantee the Conservatives winning the next general election . That would be absurd. \"We have controlled a number of these councils for 14 to 15 years and we not heard from Birmingham and Coventry. We are back in the met areas in a way we have not been since the 1980s... if I were the Labour party I would be very worried. I would be asking why, for the very first time in the history of this country, the governing party does not come second, but third. \"UKIP are taking votes from all the parties in the areas where they are fighting for seats. We will have to wait and see what happens in the London elections and EU but it is quite clear that the party making gains is the Tory party.\" The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, said: \"Tony Blair himself acknowledged that Iraq was inevitably going to cast a long shadow overall...this was much more about predominant factors in the local elections. \"I do not think you can describe this as a Tory resurgence. \"We are fighting both parties successfully on both fronts ... we are looking to coming second overall. This is a party that is really going places. We are continuing to not just hold but substantially advance our position. This is a three way party politics and the media have to report our politics more in that way. \"The fact of the matter is we have shown ourselves both to be a robust vision on one of the biggest issues confronting the country for years and I think we have won a lot of respect as a result.\" Liberal Democrat chief executive and election strategist Lord Rennard said the party's results so far had been \"spectacular to say the least\". He said he was surprised by Lib Dem victories in areas such as Newcastle where before last night \"we thought it was a tall order to win\". Voters had voted for Lib Dems because of their opposition to the Iraq war and their proposal to replace council tax with a local income tax, he claimed. \"Tory gains have come in areas where they are already strong. They need to challenge in other areas if they are to win a general election,\" he said. Former minister Peter Mandelson hailed Labour's gain of the council in his constituency, Hartlepool. The MP said: \"Labour may have had a bad day in some other parts of the country, but the sun is shining in Hartlepool. \"We originally lost control because we took the public for granted. Now we have regained the council by putting ourselves back in touch with voters.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
