Ferrante\u2019s Italian publisher, Edizioni E/O, made the announcement with a terse tweet on Monday morning. Her English-language publisher, Europa Editions, followed suit, with a short extract indicating that the story was set in Naples. Neither publisher has revealed the new novel\u2019s title. Ferrante\u2019s four-part Neapolitan series, which began with My Brilliant Friend, told the story of the lifelong friendship and rivalry between two women who grew up in a poor neighbourhood in the southern Italian city. The second season of HBO\u2019s TV adaptation of the series, which will cover the second book of the quartet, is expected to be aired next year. Since the Neapolitan novels, Ferrante, who conceals her identity behind a pseudonym, has published one book, Incidental Inventions, a collection of columns that she wrote during her year-long collaboration with the Guardian. Ferrante\u2019s previous books include the Turin-based The Days of Abandonment and The Troubling Love. In 2016 the investigative journalist Claudo Gatti caused a storm in the literary world after claiming to unmask Ferrante as Anita Raja, a Rome-based translator who once helped run a publishing imprint of Italian writers. Gatti was criticised for a gross violation of the writer\u2019s privacy and some believed he would be blamed if Ferrante disappeared from public life. In interviews over the years, Ferrante suggested that her anonymity was a vital component of her work. Being unknown, she said, gave her the space and liberty to focus on her writing, free from the \u201canxiety of notoriety\u201d or the temptation to censor herself. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 September 2019 because an earlier version misspelled Anita Raja\u2019s last name as Raga. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
