It would be a backward step.\" The 33-year-old Thaxton has been demanding a showdown against Khan, and the British Boxing Board of Control had called for purse bids to be made today for a fight in which Thaxton's belt and Khan's Commonwealth crown would be at stake. But Warren will not countenance the prospect, and has said that the financial demands being made by Thaxton and his promoter, Mick Hennessy, are \"unrealistic,\" with Thaxton effectively pricing himself out of a fight with the 21-year-old, who has just been ranked as Britain's No1 lightweight by Boxing News. Khan is due to fight Kristjansen, a Dane ranked the No2 challenger by the WBO, at the London ExCel on February 2. \"I would have liked to have fought Thaxton to shut him up,\" said Khan, \"and it would have been nice to have been the British champion. But the most important thing is that I move closer to a world title, and fighting Thaxton would not do that for me.\" Cynics will suggest Khan is being protected. Thaxton is one of the division's more dangerous punchers, but Khan said: \"Kristjansen will create his own problems. He's a good boxer who has lost one fight.\" Meanwhile, the Conservative leader, David Cameron, will officially open a new \u00a3700,000 boxing gymnasium Khan has had built in his hometown, Bolton, with the fighter saying he has already had dozens of inquiries from as far afield as Birmingham from youngsters wanting to learn the sport."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
