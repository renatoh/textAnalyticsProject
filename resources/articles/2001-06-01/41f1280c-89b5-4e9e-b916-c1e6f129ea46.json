Which is probably just as well, as Brixton Academy's acoustics can rarely have sounded worse. Whatever the three keyboardists, guitarist, bassist and drummer might be playing blunders incomprehensibly through the speakers, each note a boulder crashing down a mountain. Get Ur Freak On is recognisable only because those words are incessantly repeated; its icy bhangra riff and Space Invader whirrs are crushed in the rubble. The lyrics of Scream aka Itchin are only intelligible because Missy delivers a snippet without backing. But you can tell from the way she interrupts One Minute Man after roughly one minute to chat aimlessly that music isn't uppermost on Missy's mind. She is here to commune with her audience, to touch hands, proclaim her love and generally behave as though her body was producing huge quantities of natural ecstasy. \"I wish that I could come down there and hold each and every one of you,\" she declares. \"I wanna show you that I'm human just like y'all.\" So she clambers into the crowd and does a lap of honour on the balcony, while bouncers vehemently shove anyone who has taken her longing for contact seriously out of the way. In case that doesn't hammer home the point that she and we are alike, Missy also devotes a good third of the concert to talent contests, looking on indulgently and acting as a cheerometer while girls compete to see who can make their bottoms wobble like jelly, local rappers big up the Brixton massive and a boy quavers through I Believe I Can Fly. The exhibitionism is amusing and it's pleasing that girls beat boys in every discipline - Missy's influence in action - but is this really what people have paid \u00a317 to see? What with the contests, the partial strip so that half her clothing can be autographed and thrown to the crowd, and the disappearing for 10 minutes to do her hair, Missy only performs about 40 minutes of music. Yes, it might as well have been played on pneumatic drills, but every moment she sing-raps and clomp-dances about the stage in her powder-blue tracksuit, she radiates charisma. Her presence in the spotlight is entertainment enough; it's a shame that she does so much to undermine that."}, "isHosted": false}}}
