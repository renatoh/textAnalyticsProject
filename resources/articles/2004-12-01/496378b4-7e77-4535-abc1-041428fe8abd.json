But from the perspective of almost two decades' work in anti-doping, I find that the past 12 months have not delivered much resolution to the biggest problem facing sport. Christmas 2003 was also a difficult time for Rio Ferdinand: he attended his long-awaited hearing over his failure to submit to a drug test. The FA hearing panel concluded that nine months' suspension was sufficient punishment; after all, he had not failed a drug test. He just forgot. There was criticism of the process that allowed Ferdinand's name to become public before the hearing but inevitably there is interest in why a player is not selected to play - particularly for his country. So it makes me wonder why in future cases results will not be announced until after the hearing process has been concluded. Under the World Anti-Doping Code's strict-liability provision an athlete is responsible for his own conduct. Ferdinand admitted he missed the test and so he should have served an immediate suspension. In contrast, Adrian Mutu's positive drug test led to the termination of his contract with Chelsea almost immediately and a disciplinary dilemma for the Football Association. The punishment had to fit the \"crime\" but the Ferdinand case had set a precedent: miss a test and you could be suspended for nine months; Mutu's ban had to be shorter so as not to encourage players to miss their tests. Mutu brought much-needed attention to the problem of addictive drugs and the role of rehabilitation. It also sent alarm bells through football boardrooms. How many clubs can truly afford to contribute towards an open-ended rehabilitation programme, to lose an expensive asset, to pay the player's salary through a suspension set by the governing body, or to take the risk that players under the influence of drugs can invalidate their insurance policies in a careless tackle or even call the result of a match into question? I admire the enthusiasm of the Football Association in wanting to introduce erythropoietin (EPO) testing; no other sport in Britain has that as a standard test. Too expensive, it is claimed, though an additional \u00a31.2m was added to UK Sport's anti-doping budget in May this year. Perhaps this was all that was left of the \u00a31.5m announced as a boost for sport by Tessa Jowell, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, in November 2002 after severance payments were made to UK Sport staff. The same announcement promised \u00a33.2m for anti-doping in 2005-06, which should deliver at least a couple of blood tests for priority sports such as cycling and athletics. At least football appears willing to invest money to get EPO tests going. Not before time if the reported remarks of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger have a basis of truth. His concern about the blood tests of players transferred from abroad showing abnormally high red blood-cell counts raised the possibility of EPO abuse in football. Do we have an extensive and targeted testing programme to cover the transfer market? Not yet. What the past 12 months should have led to is a continuous programme of testing for at least six months after transfer, with a money-back guarantee. The conviction of the Juventus club doctor for supplying drugs to players between 1994 and 1998 is a wake-up call. The World Anti-Doping Code allows for the reduction or elimination of penalties if athletes can show that they did not know they had been administered banned drugs. Doctors or other medical staff could find themselves in the frame for a player's doping offence; however, the UK has always shown remarkable tolerance to the involvement in doping of medics or coaches. The Balco situation in the United States should kickstart investigations into other products such as the use of the supplement ZMA by UK athletes. However, there is no mechanism in the UK for a Balco-type investigation. Without a national anti-doping organisation with investigative powers and formal authority, it will be left to sports governing bodies to see what their coaches and athletes are up to in the pursuit of medals. If David Millar had not admitted to a French judge he took EPO, we would never have known. Plans for the future do not look good. Revisions to the UK's national anti-doping policy may remove the life ban from lottery funding for athletes who cheat. When an independent review by UK Sport concluded that the UK did not need an independent agency, it did recommend further work to examine governance, reporting and line management in more detail. In the US, President Bush spoke out against steroid abuse in baseball, but here in the UK things are apparently rosy in the garden."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
