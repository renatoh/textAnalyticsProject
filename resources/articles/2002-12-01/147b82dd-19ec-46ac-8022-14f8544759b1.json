Northern Ireland has not yet gone over the brink, but it has been heading in that direction. The original response of the Ulster Unionist leaders to the Hillsborough Accord with Dublin was a threat to make the province ungovernable. They have now seen something of what that entails and do not like the look of it. Unless they can persuade the Apprentice Boys of Derry to show the 'sensitivity' which everybody has begun to advocate they are likely to see more of it in Portadown. In ten days' time the instant tradition of holding a provocative parade through Catholic areas of the town on May 5 is due to be honoured for the first time. Ungovernability takes a greater toll on the governed than on the governors. The package of hostile measures announced by Mr Paisley and Mr Molyneaux is enough for the time being to keep opposition to the agreement at the political level. Both men are clearly afraid that it might rapidly descend much further than it has done to a lower one. But if it does, the paramilitaries can claim that they are only enacting the wishes expressed in the past by the Unionist leadership, just as the IRA can claim that it is making sure, and by the only means available, that the stated aims of Irish republicanism come to pass. Rash promises are coming up for redemption on every side. There is every reason for both governments to be 'sensitive,' and there was no supposition from the beginning that they would be anything else. But it must be clear that everything the agreement stands for is still in place. Any derogation from it would revive Loyalist triumphalism to such an extent that any hope of a working settlement in Northern Ireland could be forgotten for another generation. The Social Democratic and Labour Party would be forced out of business and only Sinn Fein would remain to carry the nationalist banner, or rather fire the nationalist gun. At no time has Mrs Thatcher's - or Westminster unity - resolve been more necessary. But there's the rub. The Westminster parties are in ultimate charge of Northern Ireland but they draw no votes from there, have no constituents to look after, and did not need to consult anyone before the Agreement was drawn up. Their interest is entirely theoretical. The realisation of this is probably the main reason for Unionists' hostility to what is going on - that their fortunes are being settled by people remote from any possible consequences. In that case they should be dealing not with the British Government only but with the Northern Nationalists and Dublin, in both of which locations the consequences of the realignments now taking place are anything but remote. Mr Harold McCusker, Deputy Leader of the OUP, and Mr Frank Millar, the Party's General Secretary, have both made speeches which suggest that the idea is not now totally alien. It is, of course, highly desirable that the Unionists should resume trade with Westminster, and a method of talking about talks, or even talking substantively, which spanned the marching season would keep the streets clean for the summer. But in the continuing talks between London and Dublin which are now entrenched in the politics of Ireland, Britain can do no more than act as surrogate for the Unionists. Would it not be better for them to do the talking themselves?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
