Although it is listed as a lowly 853 x 480 pixel resolution, it's able to do a very good job with an HDTV signal (I can't believe it could be bettered, to be honest) and is listed as being 1080i compatible. If I bought a screen with a resolution of 1920 x 1080, would I see a discernible difference? Karl Lear Jack Schofield replies: If you bought a similar 42-inch 1080p screen, fed it with a 1080p signal from a high-definition player (Blu-ray or HD DVD) and sat up to 6ft away, I'd bet you probably could. However, if you were watching standard or HD broadcast television or a DVD movie from 10 feet, I'd bet you probably couldn't. Your new set might even look worse than your old EDTV (enhanced definition TV) set. For newcomers, standard television in the UK is 720 x 576 pixels, and there are three HD standards: 720p (1280 x 720), 1080i (1920 x 1080 interlaced) and 1080p (1920 x 1080 progressive scan). \"Interlaced\" means the screen image is painted in two scans covering alternate lines, whereas \"progressive\" means it is all done in one scan. In theory, 1080p is the best. At the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Panasonic ran tests on its stand and most people couldn't tell the difference between its 1080p and 720p screens, so I'm sure they couldn't tell 720p from 1080i. I therefore don't think it's worth paying the extra today for a \"true\" 1080p HD set unless you have 1080p content from a next-gen player or games console (gamers sit closer to the screen). In general, you should get the best result if the resolution of the signal matches the resolution of the screen. It rarely does. Most sets upscale or downscale (and interlace or de-interlace) whatever they are sent to fit the native resolution: 853 x 480 pixels, in your case. JVC and Panasonic are among the companies that seem to be good at this. A set that does a bad job of upscaling a TV signal to 1080p - and it's a mammoth processing task - could end up with a noticeably worse picture, in spite of it being \"theoretically\" better. Drive failure I have an external USB hard drive that just refuses to work. My wife and I are upset at the prospect of losing pictures of our children. I have quotes from data recovery companies and they are all in the range of \u00a3350 to \u00a3400 plus VAT. Is there a cheaper alternative? Joaquin Blanco JS: Not unless you know what you are doing. It might be that the drive would work if you extracted it from the enclosure and installed it in a PC, or if you replaced the electronics board, but who knows? Inexpert attempts to recover data can make things worse, and basically you have only one chance. If it's any consolation, I've been quoting \u00a31,000 as a ball park figure for expert disk recovery. Otherwise, Schofield's Second Law of Computing says data doesn't really exist unless you have two copies of it. In the case of important family photos, I'd suggest four copies: PC hard drive; CD-Rom; external storage (eg a USB drive or thumb drive) and online - Xdrive or Google email will do. Broadband woes My broadband went down and now I seem to be caught between Virgin (which charges 25p a minute) and BT (which takes forever to reply). I am now connected directly to the BT test socket in my house so there should be nothing in the way. While talking to Virgin, I found I could log on to the internet while I was on the telephone, but when I put down the receiver, my broadband disconnected. Virgin called this \"high open\" - a phrase I have never heard before. David Pollard JS: I'm surprised Virgin didn't go on to say something like: \"That means there's a fault on your line.\" Tell BT that you have a crackly line and ask for \"loop test\" - but don't mention broadband. See dslreports.com and google.com (it's a search) for more information. It seems that if you were not connected to the test socket, the fault could have been with your house wiring. Graphics crashes When I reboot my PC from standby, it says: \"The IALMRNT5 display driver has stopped working normally. Save your work and reboot the system to restore full display functionality.\" Glyn Trafford JS: IALMRNT5.dll is an Intel Express graphics driver, and Intel's website acknowledges a problem running the Sims 2 game - which doesn't apply here. There's not much you can do except download the newest graphics driver you can find. You can also try changing the graphics resolution and removing any start-up programs in case there's a conflict. Processor hogs The Windows Task Manager shows that two programs running on my PC take 90% to 100% of my CPU the majority of the time, making it almost unusable. These programs are appsvc32.exe and svchost.exe. Robert Alleyne JS: Well, appsvc32.exe is part of Norton Internet Security 2007, and can hog the processor in some circumstances. As its name implies, svchost.exe is a program that hosts a variety of different services, but Windows Task Manager doesn't tell you which. Download SysInternals' Process Explorer and it will tell you, if you hover the mouse over the filename. You may find it's another part of Norton, in which case you will have to try Symantec's help site. Backchat \u00b7 Spybot panic over: having now had chance to check, I did not in fact give an incorrect address for the Spybot site on February 15. If you downloaded spybotsd14.exe from one of the approved mirrors then you should not have a problem. Spybot is freeware and works with no payment, though donations are invited. I can't explain why some readers reported otherwise. \u00b7 On recycling: Mike Hunter says his old Pentium PC with Windows 98SE isn't worth anything: \"I have offered it to local computer recycling charities and they said no.\" Douglas and Julie had mixed luck: Dell agreed to recycle their old Dell. But: \"They offer a collect service via DHL. Unfortunately after waiting in all day they haven't turned up.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
