Did not deserve to be on the losing side Antonio Valencia 4 Caught hopelessly out of position for Monreal\u2019s goal and awful back-pass gifted Welbeck the winner. One of his poorer games Chris Smalling 5 Poor touch allowed S\u00e1nchez an opening and missed a glorious chance to score from inside the six-yard box and keep United in the Cup Marcos Rojo 5 Rash at times and fortunate the referee missed a grab on Welbeck\u2019s shoulder when the striker was through. Yellow carded then taken off Luke Shaw 6 Struggled to cope with Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s direct running but got forward when he could until his number came up Ander Herrera 5 One delightful ball to Di Mar\u00eda showed what he can do but remains on the periphery of the play and was hauled off at half-time Daley Blind 6 Kept United ticking over in the Carrick role until the man himself came on but United\u2019s midfield lacks the necessary forward thrust \u00c1ngel di Mar\u00eda 7 Wonderful cross for Rooney\u2019s goal, forced smart save from Szczesny and drilled a shot wide before he was sent off for grabbing the referee Ashley Young 7 Ran at Beller\u00edn at every opportunity, forcing Wenger to substitute the Spaniard, but never managed to break the shackles completely Marouane Fellaini 7 His presence and hold-up play gave Van Gaal\u2019s side a threat, if not a pretty one. Passed up great chance to shoot to show his limitations Wayne Rooney 8 Restored to favoured striker role he took his goal with aplomb. Looked sharp on the turn and was quick to switch attacks but lacked support Arsenal Wojciech Szczesny 6 Saved well from Di Mar\u00eda at his near post but looked shaky at times and almost patted a searching cross straight into Fellaini\u2019s path H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn 6 Early booking for tackle on Young made it a testing night and could easily have got a second yellow before he was substituted Per Mertesacker 7 Started nervously on return to the side but thwarted dangerous Di Mar\u00eda raid early in the second half and made vital interception late on Laurent Koscielny 7 Left Rooney too much space for the goal but grew in stature as the game went on and dealt with United\u2019s front two without panic Nacho Monreal 8 Defensive discipline has made him Wenger\u2019s No1 left-back but showed great composure with his goal. An unlikely hero Francis Coquelin 8 Early blow to his broken nose didn\u2019t stifle his energy. Buzzed around Fellaini to win second balls and start Arsenal attacks Santi Cazorla 7 Began slowly but his quick feet had a greater effect in the second period and his fine strike was only denied by a world-class De Gea save Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain 8 Tore at the United defence from the off and showed wonderful footwork to create Monreal\u2019s goal. Injury ended his game not long after the break Mesut \u00d6zil 6 A typical day at the office for the German. Clever and threatening every now and again but not involved enough for the money Danny Welbeck 7 Surprise selection ahead of Giroud and heavy first touches suggested rustiness but was quick to pounce when it mattered most Alexis S\u00e1nchez 7 Tricky and direct, his battle with Valencia was a feature. Not his best performance in an Arsenal shirt but never tired and nearly got his goal"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
