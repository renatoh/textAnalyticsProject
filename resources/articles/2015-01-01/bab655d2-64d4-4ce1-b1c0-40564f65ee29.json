Six games in, he suddenly seems at ease in his new career. As his head coach at Bath, Mike Ford, made clear later, Burgess is still very much a work in progress and if an immediate England place is fanciful, playing a part when the second-string Saxons take on Ireland Wolfhounds seven days before the Six Nations begins is suddenly the realistic option Lancaster imagined when Burgess played his first union game six weeks ago. \u201cSam played his best game and he is definitely on the right track,\u201d said Ford before the England lock Dave Attwood suggested that the 26-year-old\u2019s rugby education might benefit from time at England\u2019s Test base in Surrey. \u201cHe\u2019s the kind of player who would benefit from that environment,\u201d said Attwood after being at the heart of the huge forward effort which set up Burgess\u2019s first Premiership try \u2013 the third of five from Bath. \u201cHe\u2019s picking it up very quickly, but he\u2019s a talented bloke. \u201cYou saw today what he can do. He\u2019s a massive specimen, really physical, and he\u2019s got a really varied skill-set. He adds a very different dimension to what we can do in the midfield. Every game he is growing in stature and bringing more and more of his kind of game to the party, which is ultimately what we want. \u201cWe want more of Sam Burgess out there. He is comfortable and asserting himself. He made a couple of game-changing tackles, some great carries and capped it off with a nice try. For someone who people argue doesn\u2019t know the rules of the game, man of the match in almost a 40-point win, we are not struggling too much.\u201d Before that try Burgess had been a thorn in Wasps\u2019 side for 45 minutes, bursting through tackles and flattening anyone in his path. Twice in a minute the man playing opposite, Ben Jacobs, felt the weight of his 18st, 6ft 5in frame. Playing inside centre \u2013 Lancaster\u2019s problem position \u2013 alongside Jonathan Joseph, another man with Test hopes, and outside the England fly-half George Ford, the midfield and match of styles kept Wasps on the hop, Burgess doing more in his first 10 minutes than his combined previous experience. If Attwood urges caution over England \u2013 \u201cLet\u2019s walk before we can run. A few more man of the matches would be great\u201d \u2013 there is no doubt that Burgess is beginning to impress. \u201cHe is an ultimate professional, he is in great shape, he looks after himself, he helps drive standards and move people forward off the field as well as on it.\u201d As for the man himself, after being denied a try at Leicester last week, he was pleased \u201cto get the monkey off my back\u201d, and generally happy about his progress. \u201cI am improving week to week, and enjoying a bit more time on the field,\u201d said Burgess. \u201cOverall, I am happy with the way things are going. This game wasn\u2019t as slow as last week \u2013 I touched the ball once in the first half at Leicester \u2013 so it suited me and the whole team.\u201d The frustration for Lancaster is that while Burgess is available but short on experience, Nathan Hughes, the No8 who has seamlessly replaced Billy Vunipola in Wasps\u2019 ranks, will not be available for more than a year. After being signed from Auckland, the 23-year-old qualifies on residency in March 2016, but on Saturday might easily have wrested the man of the match award from Burgess, scoring a try of his own and making one for another player who could play for Samoa in this year\u2019s World Cup, Alapati Leiua. It was Hughes\u2019s perfect line, spotted by Jacobs, which sliced Bath open during a first half in which Bath were almost embarrassingly superior to a side who started the day fourth in the Premiership. Fifteen points down at half-time and behind 27\u20115 after Ford found Burgess in space and only five metres out, Hughes\u2019s try sparked a remarkable Wasps turnaround that culminated in tries for Jacobs and the replacement fly-half Sam Lozowski within a minute and a bonus point. It might have been more but Matt Banahan had already brushed Joe Simpson aside and Ollie Devoto had added a fifth during a brief spell on the pitch.
