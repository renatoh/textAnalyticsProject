Let\u2019s hear it for St Andrews", "bodyText": "The front-page headline \u201cOxford falls to third place in university rankings\u201d (8 June) could just as easily\u2013 and more positively \u2013 have read: \u201cSt Andrews rises to second place in university rankings.\u201d Is this an example of favouring negative news over positive, or is it simply anti-Scottish prejudice? Congratulations to St Andrews. Fiona Collins Carrog, Denbighshire \u2022 It\u2019s unfortunate that in mentioning Melissa Harrison\u2019s novel, All Among the Barley, you pictured her against a field of wheat (The books that made me, Review, 8 June). Sue Leyland Hunmanby, North Yorkshire \u2022 No doubt there will be people in Peterborough seeking to overturn Labour\u2019s small majority (Letters, 8 June). They will, of course, be given that chance on 5 May 2022, (a little under three years). Fortunately, democracy allows the electorate the opportunity to change its mind. Sometimes. Jane Taylor Sherborne, Dorset \u2022 One of our managers used to give candidates a bottle of water (Dirty mugs and dirtier mind games, G2, 6 June). If they drank from the bottle instead of pouring it into a glass they were automatically rejected as \u201cthey weren\u2019t the kind of people we wanted in the firm\u201d. Bill Onwusah London \u2022 As a teacher who lived through Michael Gove\u2019s tenure as education secretary, I wonder if his drug habit might have lasted rather longer than he has admitted (Report, 10 June). Phil Badger Elsecar, South Yorkshire \u2022 I feel Michael Gove would make a more flexible Brexit negotiator than Theresa May. He would surely replace her red lines with white ones.
