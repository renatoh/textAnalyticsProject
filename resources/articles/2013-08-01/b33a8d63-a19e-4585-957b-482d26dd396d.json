Play England, which is getting \u00a31.1m from the government, will use some of the money to help residents close off their roads from traffic periodically. The money is part of a \u00a35.1m cash injection from the department to try to get children and families exercising more. One year after the Olympics, a quarter of the adult population is not doing even 30 minutes of exercise a week, putting their health at risk, while only a third of boys and a quarter of girls meet the recommendation for at least 60 minutes of physical activity a day, says the department. \"It's fantastic that more than half of English adults are doing the recommended amount of physical activity, but I am shocked that more than a quarter are not getting even 30 minutes of exercise a week,\" said public health minister Anna Soubry. Change4Life sports clubs will get \u00a33m, and \u00a31m more will be spent on walking initiatives in eight cities."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
