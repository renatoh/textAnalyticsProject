Dennis Lillee said it yesterday. Most Australians have been saying it for weeks. Why on earth - goes the argument - did England turn up down under with a planeload of crocks? How the hell - it continues, heckles rising - do they expect to beat Australia with 11 limpers and wheezers, when 11 grown men with all their limbs intact have failed to do the job in the past? Well, they have a point. But they might like to consider this one too: of all the players England would ideally have chosen for this week's first Ashes Test, only Darren Gough is not available, and the only person who seems surprised by that is Gough himself. At various points on this tour, we have been told that Michael Vaughan, Marcus Trescothick, Mark Butcher, Andy Flintoff, Simon Jones, and now Steve Harmison were injury doubts. Yet the first five are all likely to play at Brisbane, and Harmison probably wouldn't have been picked anyway. England's calculated risk was a necessary one, because a bunch of fully fit second-stringers would have stood even less chance of regaining the Ashes. And the risk has - by and large - been vindicated. In any case, the absence of Gough is not the disaster that mock-sympathetic Aussies are making it out to be. Gough hasn't played a Test match since August 2001, and would have been a reckless pick. And his most recent Ashes series, when he averaged nearly 39 with the ball, will be fresh in Australian minds. For the time being, his talismanic properties are best employed off the field. Gough's injury and Harmison's shin splints have meant a long-overdue return to the squad for Alex Tudor, a man who on Test debut at Perth four years ago was too quick for the two Waughs, Ricky Ponting and Justin Langer. Since then he has played just eight Tests out of 45, and had a major say in four of them. Forget hernias and hairlines: the real scandal of recent times has been England's treatment of Tudor. QUOTE OF THE WEEK \"After many a rousing Ashes battle I never thought I'd feel sorry for a Pom. But I must admit I can't help but sympathise with England captain Nasser Hussain at the moment\" - Dennis Lillee, a man who once charged in to bowl against England with the crowd chanting \"kill, kill\", sheds crocodile tears in his Mirror column. SILLY POINT: VINTAGE WARNE Shane Warne. Now there's a blast from the past. He scoffed cheese toasties, swilled VB lager, had four different types of delivery that went straight on, and tried not to rubbish the Poms too much because Steve Waugh told him it was wrong to rile the opposition. Predictably, Warne ran out of puff and now owns a surf-hire shop in St Kilda's. Shame, really, because he was quite a character. His place in the Australian team has been taken by some bloke called Shane Uberwarne. He butters only one side of his toastie (and regularly shows off his pectorals to passing strangers), has just released his own brand of wine, has five different types of delivery that go straight on - one of them, apparently, accounted for about half of his 27 wickets in the recent three-Test series against Pakistan - and has a go at the Poms whenever he can because Waugh has decreed that seven Ashes wins in a row grants you a little psychological leeway. Back in July, Warne (remember him?) made the mistake of speaking his mind. \"This time could be close,\" he said, referring to the Ashes. \"It could be an interesting series.\" Uberwarne, though, knows better. Take last week's article in The Australian newspaper, which appeared under the modest byline of \"Australian Test champion SHANE [UBER]WARNE\". \"One shred of self-doubt in English minds is all it will take for Australia to crush England,\" began Uberwarne in a cunning attempt to induce a shred of self-doubt in English minds. \"If the question was 'Would any England player get in the current Aussie team?' the answer would probably be no,\" continued Uberwarne, thus reflecting the general consensus in world cricket that Darren Lehmann is a better Test batsman than Michael Vaughan and that Brett Lee really is all he is cracked up to be. But Uberwarne wasn't finished. \"We can win the series 5-0,\" he announced as he admired his bulging biceps. \"England? Don't make me laugh!\" Actually, Uberwarne may not have said that last bit, but he was so busy sampling the bouquet of his latest vintage, it was hard to say. COW CORNER: AN ABSOLUTE SHOCKER The life of an international umpire can do funny things to a man. It can make him cry, as David Frost discovered on an episode of Through the Keyhole a couple of years ago, when Dickie Bird was reduced to a flood of happy tears at the merest mention of the thousands of hours he had wasted standing in the baking sun. (OK, so the Spin was at a loose end that Thursday afternoon.) It can make him deluded, as the Zimbabwean Ian Robinson found to his cost. Robinson once bragged that he was one of the best three umpires in the world, but undermined his claim by unleashing a string of howlers on unsuspecting batsmen; the ICC decided it was best not to name him in their elite umpiring panel of eight. It can make him popular. Rudi Koertzen of South Africa was recently voted the players' favourite ump in a poll at the recent ICC Champions Trophy in Colombo. He scored 28% of the vote, with England's David Shepherd second on 25%. And it can make him unpopular. The Indian umpire Srinivasaraghavan Venkataraghavan - known to his mates after a few pints as Venkat - is regarded as something of a loner on the international circuit, and was reminded of the fact during New Zealand's tour of the West Indies in June. Quietly minding his own business in the bar one evening after a game, Venkat innocently invoked the ire of his fellow umpire Koertzen, who was holding forth in another corner of the room after three or four rum and cokes too many. \"Venkat is a complete [insert expletive here]\", opined a red-faced Koertzen, rather too loudly. Which may help explain why Venkat never smiles much on the field. THE WEEK IN CRICKET Mark Waugh, the man who hates the media, has talks with Channel Nine about joining their commentary team ...
