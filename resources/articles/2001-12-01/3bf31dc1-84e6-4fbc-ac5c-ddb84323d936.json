The Welsh Rugby Union originally thought it had the right to veto the move, which was the idea of France and England, only to discover that, because there was no proposal to move the championship out of its block between February and early April, a majority decision would win the day. When the vote was taken on the proposal at a meeting of the Six Nations committee yesterday Wales found themselves on their own. \"We are very disappointed at the outcome,\" said the WRU secretary Dennis Gethin. \"The Mori poll undertaken by the committee confirmed that the majority of supporters and sponsors wanted the status quo to remain. \"We were opposed to the change because we wanted to protect our players and our supporters. A shorter period gives less recovery time for the players and puts added pressure on our fans, who travel to matches in greater numbers than those from any of the other countries.\" Wales was the only union not to pay \u00a38,000 towards the costs of having its own fans polled, the WRU saying it was a waste of money because it knew what the answers would be, but supporters, both those who travel to matches and those who watch the internationals on television, from the other five countries were questioned along with sponsors and 67% favoured playing the championship over 10 weeks. Their dislike of the idea of Friday night international rugby has been taken on board, with the fixtures in 2003 to be played on a Saturday or Sunday. The 2003 tournament, which will open in the middle of February and close at the end of March, will start and finish with two consecutive weekends of action while two rest periods will be interrupted by a single round. Twickenham is delighted with the change, though it has not ruled out releasing players back to their clubs for the two free weekends. \"The decision is a step forward,\" said Francis Baron, the chief executive of the Rugby Football Union, which had originally pressed for the tournament to be played in one go. \"With so many interested parties, there was an inevitable element of compromise. Subject to England Rugby Ltd approval, it is our intention to release players to take part in the Zurich Premiership when the championship is inactive.\" Newcastle's rugby director Rob Andrew, whose blueprint for the professional game in England, which was published a year ago, recommended a structured season with tournaments played in blocks, cautiously welcomed the change. \"It is clear that progress is going to have to be made bit by bit,\" he said. \"Playing the championship over seven weeks is better than the current system but it is a long time for clubs to go into hibernation. We have to decide whether it is worth playing two league rounds during the championship, given that the England As and Under-21s will also be in action, but at least something has been achieved.\" The move is likely to be popular with players. \"We will be better able to replicate World Cups,\" said Neil Back, the England flanker, \"but clubs should not be forgotten about.\" The Wales scrum-half Rob Howley welcomed the end of a system which saw players go from a week in camp together to knocking lumps out of each other in league and cup derbies. My concern with the new system is that, if someone picks up an injury in the first match, it may be his last appearance in the championship that year because there will be less time to recover.\" The decision of the Six Nations committee should help in shaping the European season more constructively and it will now be possible, for example, for the Heineken Cup group stage to be played in a six-week block rather than in three different stages. \"We have to remember that we have not gained any weekends,\" said Andrew. \"We are still some way from getting the structure our game needs.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
