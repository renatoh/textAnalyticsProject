The interim ruling was announced by Mr Justice Charles, vice-president of the court, who said that he \u201cstruggled\u201d to think of any public interest in identifying the woman who is known only as \u201cC\u201d. \u201cHow is the public interest advanced by naming her and causing great distress?\u201d he asked. Media organisations are challenging reporting restrictions imposed by the court at the request of her family. At issue is whether there is a public interest in disclosing the woman\u2019s name, particularly after she was the subject of a frank and personally critical judgment, and whether preventing identification after death establishes a restrictive legal precedent. During the hearing, Charles questioned whether some photographs published by newspapers \u2013 in which her face was pixellated \u2013 had already breached the injunction against identifying her. The court, he added, would have to consider the implications of what would happen if there was an inquest into the woman\u2019s death. He said the case was likely to have an impact on a pilot project planned by the court of protection aimed at making its proceedings more transparent. He reserved full judgment pending further submissions. Lawyers for the media, who are seeking to name the woman, are to provide written evidence explaining why it would be in the public interest to identify her. The court of protection deals with cases involving sick and vulnerable people who may not be able to take decisions. In the case of C, who did not wish to undergo dialysis, the court ruled that she had the mental capacity to decline medical care at King\u2019s College hospital NHS foundation trust in London. The trust is now said to be \u201cneutral\u201d about whether the woman should be named. The original anonymised judgment, written by Mr Justice MacDonald, said C felt her life had \u201clost its \u2018sparkle\u2019\u201d and she did not want to grow old. Richard Spearman QC, representing one of the woman\u2019s three daughters, told the court of protection: \u201cThe family are very distressed by what has happened. [This family] had nothing to do with bringing these proceedings to court. \u201cThe effect of the application by the NHS trust was to put an enormous amount of private material into the public domain. They had to come to court. \u201cThe purpose of having open justice is not to write invasive stories; it\u2019s not to lift pictures off Facebook pages and contact dozens of people who may have known this woman \u2026 It is difficult to identify what public interest is served by naming C. There has been considerable press coverage following the judgment.\u201d Some reporting of the case so far, he added, was no more than \u201cdigging for dirt\u201d. One reporter had approached an 80-year-old woman who had rented out property to a daughter several years ago, claiming that he intended to write a \u201cmemorial piece\u201d about the mother. Spearman said the family felt under siege and snatched photographs had been taken. \u201cThere\u2019s evidence of highly intrusive and unacceptable conduct. If the anonymisation was lifted in this case it would be significantly worse.\u201d Solicitors from the law firm Bindmans, representing the woman\u2019s daughter, have said the mother should remain anonymous in death to protect her relatives\u2019 human rights to private and family life. The youngest daughter is aged 15. Lawyers for the Daily Mail, the Times, the Daily Telegraph and the Independent argue that any ban on identifying the woman after death is a significant interference with the right to freedom of expression and that evidence of potential harm to family members is \u201cvery thin\u201d. The Guardian is not party to the claim. In written submissions to the court, Adam Wolanski, counsel for the media organisations, said that now the woman had died she had no rights under article 8 of the European convention of human rights, which guarantees respect for private and family life. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the child is aware of the publicity around the case ... There is a proper interest in the name of a person who dies being a matter of public record whether or not there is to be an inquest,\u201d Wolanski said. \u201cJudges and practitioners in the court of protection must be on their guard to ensure that their naturally protective instincts, developed through years of giving paramount consideration to the welfare of children and the best interests of vulnerable adults, do not lead them to underestimate the importance of [freedom of speech issues].\u201d In a different case last year, another judge ruled that a bar on naming a Jehovah\u2019s Witness who rejected blood transfusion or treatment with blood products could be lifted after she had died. However, Mr Justice Jackson said at the time that each case had to be considered on its individual merits, adding: \u201cThere is no good reason to conclude that the person\u2019s death should lead automatically to all protection being lost.\u201d The case continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
