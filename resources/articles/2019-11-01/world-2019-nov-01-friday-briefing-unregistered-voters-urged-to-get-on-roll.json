There has been a surge in young people registering to vote, with almost a third of the 316,264 registrations submitted in the last two days from people aged under 25, according to government figures. However, 9.4 million people are still missing from the electoral roll, says the Electoral Reform Society (ERS), and large disproportions remain between different social and economic groups who register. The final date to enrol to vote is 26 November. \u201cWe cannot be complacent \u2013 this election must see the biggest registration drive this country has seen to ensure it genuinely represents all of us,\u201d said Willie Sullivan, ERS senior director. Gary Younge writes this morning: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the story of this forthcoming election will be \u2026 Electability is, ultimately, decided not by opinion-forming elites but by the voters.\u201d Donald Trump has appeared on LBC radio and called for an alliance between the Tories and Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party. It is generally considered a breach of protocol for world leaders to pick a side in foreign elections. Corbyn accused Trump of \u201ctrying to interfere in Britain\u2019s election to get his friend Boris Johnson elected\u201d so that American companies can get their hands on the NHS. Unhelpfully for Johnson, Trump said the US \u201ccan\u2019t make a trade deal with the UK\u201d under \u201ccertain aspects\u201d of Boris Johnson\u2019s stalled Brexit deal with the EU \u2013 leaving No 10 scurrying to insist that \u201cwe can strike our own free trade deals\u201d under the deal. The PM faced a frosty reception at Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge where he visited unannounced with national media not invited to attend. He was confronted by Julia Simons, a 23-year-old medical student, who later criticised him as \u201ccowardly\u201d and for using the hospital for a \u201cPR stunt\u201d. Antoinette Sandbach, one of the rebel Conservative MPs ejected from the party, is to recontest her seat of Eddisbury for the Liberal Democrats.

For example, about 50 linguists listened in to shortwave German radio at Abbots Cliff House near Dover. At another site, Marston Montgomery, Pamela Pigeon, a New Zealander, became in 1943 the agency\u2019s first female commander, overseeing about 100 people who worked fingerprinting individual German radios \u2013 taking advantage of the fact, explains the GCHQ historian Tony Comer, that each crystal at the heart of a radio oscillated slightly differently. \u201cIt presented an easy way to distinguish between a bomber squadron or simply fighter aircraft.\u201d Ivy Farm, in Knockholt in Kent, was the first place to intercept a fax: a diagram showing a typical US bomber formation, being sent from Berlin to Japan. Staff at Ivy Farm were able to grab the communication and pass it on to the Americans so they could adapt. * * * Russia 2018 email trove for sale \u2013 An anonymously run Telegram account has put up for sale emails relating to Russia\u2019s 2018 World Cup bid, after reports that Russian officials compiled a dossier on how to buy the votes of Fifa executive council members. The emails\u2019 existence was first reported by investigative website the Insider. They purportedly belong to Sergei Kapkov, a Russian politician and former head of the country\u2019s national football academy. Separately, an investigative journalist has infiltrated a Polish troll farm to gather evidence of its operations. Katarzyna Pruszkiewicz spent six months working at Cat@Net, an \u201cePR agency\u201d producing both leftwing and rightwing content. A majority of Cat@Net\u2019s employees are understood to be disabled, allowing the company to derive substantial public subsidies. * * * Alarm over firework injuries \u2013 Fireworks should have to carry graphic warnings and be sold in plain packaging to stop people getting maimed, NHS surgeons have said. A&amp;E units are likely to end up treating those injured on bonfire night next Tuesday because fireworks have been misused or exploded near people. \u201cHand surgeons see devastating injuries caused by fireworks throughout the winter months, with people often losing large portions of their hand,\u201d said David Newington, president of the British Society for Surgery of the Hand (BSSH). Mark Henley, president of Britain\u2019s plastic surgeons\u2019 association, said: \u201cAlthough packaged as toys, these are serious explosives, and the types of reconstructive surgery being required would not be out of place in a war zone.\u201d * * * Trump dumps big apple \u2013 Donald Trump has officially changed his primary place of residence from Trump Tower, New York, to Mar-a-Lago, Florida. \u201cI cherish New York,\u201d Trump tweeted, but \u201cdespite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state.\u201d New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, replied: \u201cGood riddance. It\u2019s not like [Trump] paid taxes here anyway ... He\u2019s all yours, Florida.\u201d The US House of Representatives has voted as expected to carry on with impeachment proceedings against the nascent Floridian. Meanwhile on the 2020 election trail, Kamala Harris has been taking drastic action to boost her flagging campaign for the Democratic nomination. But Harris has faced daunting odds before: in 2003 she had a polling average of 5% when entered the race for district attorney of San Francisco.

De Niro nods along furiously. Pacino is in the groove. \u201cSometimes I feel I know nothing about acting. Until you start. That\u2019s what\u2019s exciting for me. A new character. I often say: \u2018Desire is more motivating than talent.\u2019 I\u2019ve seen people with great desire take it through. The truth is, it\u2019s the same thing that is always was: you are feeling this new character, this new person, this new story.\u201d As he grinds to a halt, Pacino looks pleased: he has come out with something all right.
