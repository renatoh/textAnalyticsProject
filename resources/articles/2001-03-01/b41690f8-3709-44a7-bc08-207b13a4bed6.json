I got silver-haired sunseekers from Bolton; more Club 18-80 than Club Tropicana. By the third day I had food poisoning, an intimate knowledge of Dora from Hull's shingle problems and a feeling that I was 10 years too late - and 40 years too young - for the good times in Goa. Since the authorities banned loud music on the beaches between 10pm and 7am last year, the rave scene has gone. Anjuna was a ghost town. The caf\u00e9s stood empty, their shutters banging theatrically in the breeze. My party pilgrimage was due to kick off in this Mecca of the hippie trail and home of the free-spirited... Perhaps everyone was on the beach? No, the grimy sands were deserted too - apart from the hawkers that swooped on the first pale tourist of the season. 'Yes Madam! Liking bangle necklace henna tattoo T-shirt sari sarong?' 'One massage you wish madam, please to remove clothes.' 'Fruity fruit? You buy banana coconut pineapple orange or maybe cashews?' Polite refusals had no effect. They squatted at the corners of my towel, waving bracelets and oranges beneath my nose as I feigned enormous interest in my bottle of Factor 15. After five minutes I felt like Tippi Hedren in The Birds and my refusals grew somewhat less polite. Shouting 'GO AWAY!' hysterically had no effect, but finally they dispersed when I promised desperately to visit their stalls later on. Alone at last, I ventured into the water and stood on a crab. 'Yes Madam! Is later now, OK? You will buy now yes definitely!' They awaited me like the reception party from hell as I hopped painfully out of the sea. A torrent of abuse got me another five-minute stay of execution and then they were back. I ran. Baga was busier than Anjuna at least. I accosted some other stray twentysomethings and begged them to be my friends. Our disillusioned little youth club wandered around the Costa Del Elderly, searching in vain for any sign of the 'Goa scene'. We wrote fictitious postcards about the fantastic nightlife based on a disappointing outing to the uninspiring Banana Bar. This proved to be a mosquito-infested shack in the middle of a swamp featuring a DJ with a couple of Europop compilation tapes. Time for a change of scene. We headed for Old Goa for some sightseeing. We strolled around the old churches and old colonial buildings and dutifully investigated the museum of old Goan artefacts. We contemplated the remains of St Francis Xavier, miraculously preserved through the ages. Keeping with the spirit of things, I ate an old fish for lunch. The next couple of days passed in a grim frenzy of food poisoning. I was unsteadier than Dora by the time I tottered back to the beach. By this time Dave and his mates had arrived. These were men on a mission - to celebrate Dave's forthcoming nuptials by drinking around the clock and singing their repertoire of football chants non-stop. They occasionally paused for nourishment - 'None of your Indian muck!' - or to attempt to drown each other. Sadly, none succeeded. As a recuperating invalid, I sipped Horlicks with Dora and glared at Dave and Co. At least they were having fun, though. Remembering eventually that I too had come to Goa for a good time, I tried one last beach. Palolem was perfect - palm trees, sparkling seas and a few faded hippies. The nightlife wasn't up to much more than a sunset beer or two by the water, but it was still paradise to me. Lazing about in a bamboo beach hut, it was easy to persuade myself that Goa was still the hedonistic Utopia. OK, the raves have gone, but I could see why it was popular. After surviving the horrors of the first few days, I wasn't exactly lying in my final postcard: 'Just chilling out on the beach now - I deserve it after the week I've had - it's been a wild time!'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
