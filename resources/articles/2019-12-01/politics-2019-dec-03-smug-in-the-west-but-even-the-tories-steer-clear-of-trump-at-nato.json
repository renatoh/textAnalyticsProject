This week, real-life Hugh Grant has been knocking on doors with Lib Dem and Labour candidates urgently trying to stop Brexit, and the guy who demanded a cameo in the film Home Alone 2 has been the \u201cleader of the free world\u201d for three years. Back then, people called the Curtis film \u2013 Love, Actually \u2013 smug. But in retrospect, it had nothing on the west. Only a wildly misplaced sense of self-satisfaction could possibly have got us where we are today. Which is to say, watching a Wotsit wearing a four-foot red tie give a press conference in the US ambassador\u2019s London residence, during which he reduces Nato\u2019s complex geopolitics to the level of suburban real-estate rivalries. As a visitor, Trump has a strong Ghost of Christmas Future energy to him. Those who love clinical narcissists \u2013 and who doesn\u2019t? \u2013 will be disappointed that Trump and Boris Johnson will not be doing a joint press conference at this Nato summit. But it is believed the crossing of their two streams would have had the potential to rip the very fabric of reality, creating a reversal of Nato\u2019s original aims, and plunging the 70-year-old alliance into immediate land war with Russia. Also there\u2019s an election on, and the Tories sense even a handshake with Trump could piss their electoral bed. So there won\u2019t be the chance to press the PM on the time he turned his Quick-Quotes Quill on Donald, accusing him of \u201ca quite stupefying ignorance that makes him, frankly, unfit to hold the office of president of the United States\u201d. Trump is just clever enough to pretend this never happened, which is always a neat way of insulting an overpromoted journalist. (Orson Welles used to greet the critic who gave him his worst reviews effusively every time he saw him, \u201cso he would think that I\u2019d never read a word he wrote\u201d.) Indeed, Trump used his impromptu press conference to stress his blissful unfamiliarity with a great number of things. Appearance-wise, the US president\u2019s lips are a sort of pouting anus \u2013 a mouth sphincter which today emitted a roll-call of guys and stuff he didn\u2019t know. Take Prince Andrew. \u201cI don\u2019t know Prince Andrew,\u201d Trump sighed with a moue, despite there being significant photographic evidence to the contrary. \u201cBut it\u2019s a tough story. But I don\u2019t know him.\u201d Or take Labour\u2019s leader, Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cI know nothing about the gentleman,\u201d Trump shrugged, having very recently described the Labour leader as \u201cso bad for your country\u201d, warning he\u2019d \u201ctake you in such a bad way\u201d. None of that today. \u201cReally. I know nothing about him,\u201d he said. Or take the notion that Trump thought the NHS was on the table in a future trade deal between the UK and US. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where that rumour started,\u201d mused the president, who used his state visit in June to tell the massed TV cameras, \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing in trade, everything is on the table.\u201d Today the president was pushing a line that sounded distinctly like it had been crayoned on to giant cue cards held aloft by the Conservative campaign team. \u201cWe have absolutely nothing to do with it,\u201d he insisted of the health service, \u201cand we wouldn\u2019t want to if you handed it to us on a silver platter.\u201d Alas, Trump delivered this with the same wooden conviction with which he addressed Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone 2, when he was asked where the Plaza hotel lobby was. \u201cDown the hall and to the left,\u201d gurned Trump, in a manner to make you think it was upstairs and to the right. And so with his NHS speechlet, during which he felt convincingly out-acted by the ambassador\u2019s furniture. Still, I hope Trump welcomed the chance to visit the originals of the faux-antique armchairs that litter his properties. His state visit in June featured a trip to Westminster, where his reaction to being shown a slab commemorating Lord Byron was to ask what type of marble it was, perhaps with a view to getting it as a shower tray or something. Even Trump\u2019s memories are ersatz reproductions of events. \u201cYou know that I was a fan of Brexit,\u201d he reminded journalists. \u201cI called it the day before. I was opening up Turnberry.\u201d In fact, he opened Turnberry the day after the Brexit result, when even that great seer David Cameron was beginning to get a bad feeling. As for the rest of the president\u2019s plans for the day, they seemed to have involved giving Emmanuel Macron a wedgie and preparing for tonight\u2019s Buckingham Palace reception with the Queen. The best way to do that was with some hardcore fundraising, and he was reported to be offering London-based US business people a chance to attend a reception with the president for $35,000, a photo and the reception for $50,000, and $125,00 to join a roundtable. Bigger spenders shouldn\u2019t fret \u2013 there\u2019s bound to be a secret price list for the guys who want to pay even more for something really special. Namely, the ambassador gig in a former breakaway Soviet republic, and the chance to hole up in one of the boutique Federal Correctional Institutions when you get out of your depth. So doubtless a good day was had by all. Well, all except one, perhaps. Over on a FiveLive phone in, a certain close friend was acting totally, totally, cool about not having a meeting lined up with the president. \u201cI have not, no,\u201d blustered Nigel Farage. How come? \u201cWell, this is a bit awkward, isn\u2019t it? Whilst he\u2019s a friend of mine, there\u2019s a general election going on, so I don\u2019t intend to \u2026\u201d How about a quick WhatsApp? \u201cIf there are some personal exchanges they would be purely personal. I wouldn\u2019t talk about them.\u201d You wouldn\u2019t shut up about them, dear. Commiserations today and for next week. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll remember you fondly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
