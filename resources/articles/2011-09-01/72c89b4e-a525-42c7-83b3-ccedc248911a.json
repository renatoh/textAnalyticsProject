Every one of us can do our bit, 31 August) eloquently outlines some new ways in which individuals and organisations can assist the oppressed. Some tried and trusted methods need to be enlarged too. It may only be a matter of time before there are campaigns that individuals can join to increase, for instance, the capacity of trade unions in Libya so that social justice becomes a strong part of what one hopes will be their newfound ability to use their vast oil revenues to increase living standards for ordinary people. Likewise, the Libyans may soon be receptive to a stream of civil society activists and parliamentarians who can respectfully advise them on how to build new institutions after 41 years of dictatorship. The key to success in winning popular and determined support here is to make such links human and direct \u2013 a specific classroom or union branch with which people can maintain contact often beats a generalised appeal for solidarity. Another advantage of such work is that it can unite those who probably differed over interventions that preceded the need for solidarity work by a range of non-state actors. Dave Anderson MP Labour, Blaydon Gary Kent Labour Friends of Iraq \u2022\u2008Jonathan Freedland balances the merits and demerits of the Libyan intervention, and concludes that lives are at stake and, even if no military intervention is at hand to help the Syrian people, \"We can act \u2013 and we surely must\". Last week, Newsnight similarly balanced the pros and cons of intervention in Syria in light of the Libyan experience. Regrettably, there is an alternative to intervene/don't intervene, and that is to ignore the problem and hope it will go away while talking vaguely about friends and influence in the Arab region: shamefully, this appears to be the British policy on Bahrain. At 8.45am Bahrain time on 31 August, as Bahrain's Shia Muslims prepared to celebrate their Eid, Ali Jawad Ahmad al-Shaikh, a 15-year-old protester, was shot dead in the predominantly Shia neighbourhood of Sitra. He was killed by a rubber bullet fired directly at his head from close range, only 48 hours after King Hamad had announced his \"pardon\" of the protesters who had \"insulted\" him. I worked in Bahrain for four years from 2007 to 2011 on a major education reform project launched under the auspices of the crown prince of Bahrain. I witnessed gross abuses with rubber and plastic bullets and CS gas by the regime's security forces, and \u2013 following 17 February \u2013 live fire. Since February this year we have seen repeated pardons and calls for dialogue from one part of the regime, only to be followed within days or even hours by the fatal shooting of demonstrators. One hand holds out an olive branch, while the other pulls the trigger. I concur with what Jonathan Freedland says: \"this is no cold, academic inquiry. Lives are at stake ... We can act \u2013 and we surely must.\" Dr Mike Diboll Former academic head of continuing professional development, Bahrain Teachers College \u2022\u2008Andy Beckett's well-made point about countries which go to war \"too easily\" (Our military shrinks but the British crush on conflicts just keeps growing, 1 September) highlights the probability that the alternative to armed conflict is rarely considered. Libya is the most recent casualty, with peaceboat diplomacy never even considered. Until the real alternative to war is hammered out round the conference table, the easy option will always be assumed to be the only one. David Partridge Prinsted, West Sussex \u2022\u2008The latest revelations of British/MI6 involvement with Gaddafi's regime (Gaddafi's secret link to UK rendition, 5 September) are a further illustration that any \"defence\" interference with foreign governments sooner or later backfires. Think General Zia/Pakistan, Saddam Hussein/Iraq, Gaddafi/Libya, etc. Question: what right have we to meddle in such areas/regimes? Question: why does the UK require a defence against \"terrorist\" attacks? The answer lies in the direct association \u2013 the more we interfere, the more various opposition groups see us as \"the enemy\"? Let's objectively ask: apart from such an association, why would any country/group want to terrorise the UK? We're a piddling little country with nothing to offer if they invaded our shores. Let's stop strutting around on the world stage, stop contradictory public/secret actions, and concentrate on getting our own internal house in order. Douglas Hall Edinburgh \u2022\u2008With the Arab spring reshaping the political landscape of the region, the UN security council should now fulfil its obligation to enforce international law in Western Sahara and resolve the ongoing 36-year conflict there. Exactly 20 years ago the Polisario Front laid down their arms, ending a 16-year war with Morocco. While the UN security council promised the people of Western Sahara that a referendum on independence would soon follow the ceasefire, the vote has yet to be carried out. Meanwhile, more than 100,000 Saharawi still live in refugee camps in the Algerian desert while the rest of the population suffer under an unlawful occupation. To mark this anniversary, a delegation of campaigners and MPs will today visit Downing Street to call on Britain to use her role within the UN security council to help enforce the terms of the ceasefire agreement in \"Africa's last colony\". Twenty years is too long but not too late to apply international law and bring a peaceful resolution to this conflict. Francesco Bastagli Former UN special representative on Western Sahara (2005-06) Cathy Jamieson MP Vice-chair, All party parliamentary group on Western Sahara Jeremy Corbyn MP Vice-chair, Parliamentary human rights group Mark Williams MP Secretary, APPG on Western Sahara Ann Clwyd MP Kelvin Hopkins MP Jonathan Edwards MP Paul Flynn MP Andy Love MP Stefan Simanowitz Chair, Free Western Sahara Network John Hilary Executive director, War on Want Dr Dimitrina Petrova Executive director, Equal Rights Trust John Gurr Western Sahara Resource Watch Danielle Smith Director, Sandblast Natalie Sharples Western Sahara Campaign UK \u2022 David Cameron insists UK forces should be \"very proud\" of what they've achieved in Libya. But the British government bombing the forces of Colonel Gaddafi is the same British government that sold Gaddafi \u00a34.7m worth of military equipment in 2010. As the insurgents fight against the remnants of Gaddafi's tyranny, the bullets they are dodging are very likely to be of British origin as two-thirds of the military items sold to Gaddafi by the UK in 2010 was ammunition. The British government is no friend of liberty or authentic revolutions. It has helped hijack the Libyan revolution to ensure the west continues to enjoy a strategic presence in the region. Britain continues to support the tyrannies of the region. The Ministry of Defence openly admits that British forces have trained Saudi Arabia's National Guard in the art of \"public order enforcement\" and in \"weapons, fieldcraft and general military skills training, as well as incident handling, bomb disposal, search, public order and sniper training\". 1,200 of these British-trained National Guards were used to suppress the revolution in Bahrain in March. The MoD also trained more than 100 Bahraini military officers over the past five years. In addition, the UK licensed the sale of tear gas, crowd control ammunition, stun grenades, assault and sniper rifles and sub-machine guns for export to Bahrain. If the British government is driven by altruism, why is it for revolution in Libya but against it in Bahrain? Or, indeed, in Kuwait? According to the Campaign Against the Arms Trade, Britain has approved 1,155 arms export licences for Kuwait worth \u00a3102.3m since 2003. Should UK forces be \"very proud\" of what they've \"achieved\" in Saudi Arabia or Kuwait or Bahrain? Those who might argue that previous regimes might be implicated in the arming of despots but that the ConDems represent a break with the past overlook Cameron's visit to the Middle East in February. Though he made a stop-over in Cairo and visited Tahrir Square to patronise the revolution, Cameron was in fact on a three-day tour of Gulf States aimed at boosting British arms sales in the region. He was accompanied on his tour by a 36-strong sales team including representatives from what is delicately titled the \"defence\" industry including BAE Systems, Rolls Royce and the Cobham Group. The UK leads the world in sales to the Middle East and Gulf States of fighter-jets, sub-machine guns, electric batons and tear gas. How \"proud\" should we feel about that \"achievement\"? The British involvement in Libya has nothing to do with the fight for freedom and everything to do with oil. There isn't a despot reigning in the Middle East in the last 50 years that Britain hasn't armed to the teeth. No dictator can be ruthless or brutal enough for our rulers, provided they can ensure the ready flow of cheap oil to the west. The fact is that the Arab Spring has succeeded to the extent it has despite the best efforts of the west and its leaders. Cameron is correct to assert that the US sees Britain as its \"strongest and most staunch ally\" but only in the on-going imperialist oppression of the Middle East and beyond by the west. The fact is that western governments continue to pursue their own squalid interests in the region \u2013 interests that represent everything the Arab masses have risen up against. Sasha Simic London \u2022 The EU's efforts to impose an oil embargo on Syria (EU oil embargo, 31 August) have met resistance from Italy, which wants the sanctions to apply once the current supply contracts expire in November. This cannot be allowed to happen. The Assad regime is teetering on the edge. Brave protesters are not being fazed by the brutal oppression from Assad's forces, and evidence shows a number of army officers are defecting. The international community has thus far backed up its increasingly strong words on the oppressive regime with sanctions aimed at harming its leaders while causing the least harm possible to the Syrian people. This policy is correct and must be seen through to the end. Any qualifications on EU sanctions will be seen as a sign of wavering and equivocation at a time when we must all stand united and resolute in ensuring Assad leaves office and ceases his reign of terror on his own people. Dr Charles Tannock MEP Foreign affairs spokesman, European Conservatives and Reformists group in the European Parliament and UK Conservative foreign affairs spokesman \u2022 I have been practising the very boycotts advocated by Jonathan Freedland, but with mixed results. Despite eschewing Israeli goods for three decades, this has not resulted in any noticeable level of decency being adopted by that state. On the other hand my refusal to buy US and, where possible, British goods since the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq seems to have worked wonders. Can anyone doubt the debt-driven collapse of these economies was the direct result of my actions? But perhaps those Johnson and Johnson cotton buds are made in China.
