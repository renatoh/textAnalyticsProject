For those buying on a joint income this falls to 17 per cent, though that's up from 12.6 per cent in 1996. Not surprisingly the proportion is higher in London, where a typical home loan costs a single-income buyer \u00a339.60 of every \u00a3100 of their take-home pay. For first-time buyers in the capital it is \u00a342. House prices are set to rise a further 9 per cent this year, according to figures released by Halifax last week. The UK's biggest mortgage lender said that prices had gone up 1.5 per cent in January. This means the average house price has risen by nearly 25 per cent over the last 12 months. While Halifax puts the average house price at \u00a3123,451, the property website RightMove believes it is a lot higher. Based on its own data, it predicts that the Land Registry, widely regarded as publisher of the most accurate price survey, will put the average house at nearer \u00a3154,000 when it publishes its results for the final quarter of 2002 this week. If hoovering gets you hot under the collar, maybe it's time to consider a central vacuum- cleaning system. A vacuum head is attached to entry points installed throughout your home. These are connected to a series of pipes which run under the floorboards to a main vacuum motor, usually in the garage. Advantages of this method of cleaning include less noise and greater vacuum power. VacuDuct says it costs about \u00a3500 to \u00a3600 to buy enough kit for a three-bedroom semi, plus another \u00a3500 to install it. For further information call 0800 783 6264. More than half of all first-time buyers are still paying over the odds for home insurance because they believe they have to buy cover through their mortgage lender. Direct Line, which commissioned the survey, says the resulting policies can cost up to 30 per cent more than if the customer had shopped around. The firm says such homebuyers needlessly pay \u00a33,500 in commission to their lender over 45 years of buying home insurance. Demand for homes with off-street parking spaces is expected to soar in and around the London congestion charge zone following the introduction of the scheme, according to estate agent Ludlow Thompson. The agency says that with a resident's discount on the charge worth as much as \u00a31,170 a year, landlords owning properties inside the zone which have their own parking spaces will be able to increase their rent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
