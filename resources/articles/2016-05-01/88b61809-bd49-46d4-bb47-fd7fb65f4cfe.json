A role in Maleficent", "bodyText": "Though it may take a while to establish her long-term contribution to the reputational recovery of the LSE, following its embrace of the Gaddafis , the awarding of a professorship to the actor and humanitarian envoy Angelina Jolie has already helped distract from that university\u2019s ranking in the latest league table. So much so that the makers of these lists may want to consider adding a celebrity variable to valuations such as student satisfaction and job prospects. What percentage of the university\u2019s teaching staff has appeared in a top-grossing film, such as Professor Jolie Pitt\u2019s Maleficent? Rates high for gowns? How many undergraduates are forced to endure three years of toil without meeting someone who has been up \u2013 at least \u2013 for a Bafta? Recalculated on that basis, the LSE comes top of all the universities in the world, with Oxford in second place, the credit for that going entirely to one college, Lady Margaret Hall. It recently awarded visiting fellowships to, among others, Emma Watson, Benedict Cumberbatch and Neil Tennant, of the Pet Shop Boys, promising \u201cfascinating interactions\u201d. Rewardingly, for those who appointed her to a teaching post on the LSE\u2019s forthcoming MSc in women, peace and security, excitement about Ms Jolie Pitt\u2019s arrival also added lustre to her partner scholar, Professor William Hague\u2019s simultaneous appointment \u2013 one which might otherwise have dismayed any applicants aware of the protracted period that preceded his interest in women, peace and security. Indeed, all the time he was foreign secretary, Hague\u2019s concern for women never impaired relations with, for example, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other countries responsible for their brutal subjugation. Closer to home, there is nothing on record that suggests anything other than complete contentment, on Professor Hague\u2019s part, with a Westminster system that consistently pushes women politicians to the margins. In 2013, a year after he began collaborating with Professor Jolie Pitt, he could be found mouthing \u201cstupid woman\u201d at a fellow parliamentarian. But here he is ornamenting the LSE\u2019s Gender Institute, repurposed and redeemed by the same Jolie Pitt effect that has, for the LSE, banished all thoughts of Saif Gaddafi, and his PhD. I won\u2019t be the only graduate who rushed to see if I might be eligible, academically and financially, to sit at the new professors\u2019 feet. The course does not begin until autumn 2016, when the Institute is likely to want something along the lines in place for its existing MSc in gender, development and globalisation: a 2:1, and at least \u00a312,000. Core courses will include those Professor Hague specialities \u201cgender and militarisation\u201d, \u201cgender and human rights\u201d and, of course, \u201cstupid women, peace and security\u201d. All students will write a dissertation. It\u2019s tempting. Then again, if Professor Jolie Pitt acquired her academic title without a single formal academic qualification, and her fellow amateur\u2019s gender insights do not promise to exceed the average gnat\u2019s, is it worth investing one year and a lot of money in pointless study? The LSE must have been aware that, in issuing these celebrity professorships, as opposed to guest speaker invitations, it completely trashes, as it attempts to burnish, its academic hierarchy. Maybe applicants should apply, instead, to LMH, where a majority of the celebrity fellows have GCSEs \u2013 not that these attributes were mentioned in a glowing, Hello! magazine report , celebrating the moment Oxbridge finally caught up. \u201cIt comes as no surprise,\u201d reported the magazine\u2019s higher education correspondent, \u201cthat Emma and Benedict topped the final list.\u201d True, most of the MSc\u2019s teaching will be by qualified LSE staff, whose careers followed the conventional pattern of graduation, research, publication. To be fair, Professor Hague has also published, notably his William Pitt the Younger. Perhaps with less impact, Professor Jolie Pitt published, in 2003, Notes From My Travels: Visits with Refugees in Africa, Cambodia, Pakistan, and Ecuador. There is no doubting, from these jottings, Professor Jolie Pitt\u2019s deep concern for refugees, her horror over their suffering, and her commitment to their cause. Publicising their plight, she showed herself an exemplary ambassador for the UNHCR. Graduate applicants for the LSE\u2019s MSc will judge for themselves, however, how far her insights \u2013 designed to rouse a torpid public \u2013 promise to advance their own knowledge. \u201cI honestly believe,\u201d she begins, \u201cthat if we were all aware, we would all be compelled to act.\u201d Extensive detail follows about people who have moved her, punctuated by helpless asides. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Jolie Pitt says. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I am feeling.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how many more stories I can hear.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what to write or what I feel.\u201d She concludes: \u201cRefugees are families and individuals just like us but they don\u2019t have the freedom we have. Their human rights have been violated.\u201d At least we can be fairly confident no dictator\u2019s son will be asking for help with his PhD. As effective as Jolie Pitt\u2019s many visits have been, most recently raising awareness about sexual violence in conflict, , it does not seem impossible that the full-time workers who choreographed her fact-finding missions, and academics researching in this field, might have yet more to share with postgraduates whose interests go beyond motivational speeches. \u201cStrength lies in being unafraid,\u201d Jolie Pitt told the BBC on World on the Move day. Helpfully for the LSE, any suggestion that the film star\u2019s promotion is an insult to the better qualified, but obscure, elicits accusations of snobbishness and sexism \u2013 regardless of the fact that Hague\u2019s, too, is a celebrity appointment, and one, moreover, farcically misplaced in a gender institute. The positions, it is emphasised , are of the special, \u201cvisiting professors in practice\u201d variety. So it might be best if applicants discover before, rather than after they\u2019ve signed up, that the 2014 summit which constitutes the main, Hague-Jolie claim to in-practice expertise, cost \u00a35.2m: five times more, the Observer reported, than the entire confirmed budget the UK dedicated to tackling rape in war zones the following year. Hague has since stepped down from the government project. Marcy Hersh, of the Women\u2019s Refugee Commission, told the Observer: \u201cFor an initiative that used such lofty language, I struggle to see what the initiative has tangibly created, other than recognition, acknowledgment and sympathy for the issue.\u201d To be fair, that was before the LSE created the professorships. Of course, if students are as dazzled by star quality as these appointments suggest, they will be as relaxed about a wasteful summit as they are about conspicuous inexperience. Irrespective of their verdict, an enthusiastic press response has already acclaimed the LSE\u2019s opening raid on the sidebar of shame as a creditable advance in the marketisation of higher education. So the arrival of the LSE\u2019s Tomb Raider professorship, along with the reporting of Oxford fellowships in Hello! magazine, should be a reminder to more squeamish competitors, that, if they don\u2019t get moving, all the best celebrities will be snapped up. Strength lies in being unafraid. Madonna is, I understand, available. Unless, as a mature celebrity and performer, the singer thinks a Russell Group professorship somewhat beneath her dignity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
