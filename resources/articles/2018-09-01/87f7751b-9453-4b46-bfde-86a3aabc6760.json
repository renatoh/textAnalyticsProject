Attenborough, 92, said the public broadcaster was instead focusing on shows that attracted a large audience. Speaking to Radio Times, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t think the BBC does enough [arts and culture]. It\u2019s not enough simply to say, \u2018Well, it doesn\u2019t get a big enough audience\u2019. If you\u2019re a public service broadcaster, what you should be saying is, \u2018We will show the broad spectrum of human interest. People of all kinds should be catered for\u2019.\u201d He said success should not be measured by the size of the audience, but by the breadth of subjects covered. The programme maker, who started working full-time for the BBC in 1952, went on to defend the corporation, stating the lack of arts coverage was not entirely its fault. He said the BBC was being \u201cbadgered\u201d by different people, who were also to blame for the gaps in coverage. He believes the BBC still plays an important role. He said: \u201cThere are things that only public service can do and will do, and the BBC does them.\u201d Chief among them is the ability to experiment. He argued the BBC was well placed to try new programmes and writers, as well as showcasing new attitudes and voices. He added: \u201cIf the BBC was to disappear from our homes one morning, surely we\u2019d miss it desperately? You\u2019ve only got to go to America to know that.\u201d Tony Hall, the BBC\u2019s director general, warned earlier this month that the corporation needed to secure more funding if it was to continue providing the same level of service. Attenborough, who narrated Blue Planet II, the UK\u2019s most watched television programme of 2017, said earlier this year that he would retire if he felt his work had become substandard or if he began to struggle with his mobility. When asked what he enjoyed watching, he pointed to BBC Four\u2019s two-hour sleigh ride through Norway and described BBC Two\u2019s documentary Travels in Trumpland with Ed Balls as \u201cremarkable\u201d. A BBC spokesperson said: \u201cDavid rightly recognises the importance of arts and cultural programming in public service broadcasting and no other comes close to the BBC\u2019s commitment - from Civilisations and Performance Live to regular arts discussion programmes and the forthcoming year-long Our Classical Century. That said, we would love to do even more, which is why the BBC has said that we need to look at ways of increasing our income.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
