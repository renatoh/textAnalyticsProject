A lot of Americans are going to get this, and some of them are going to die. And I hope you know that you and your families are in our thoughts, and if you want them, you\u2019re in my prayers,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cBut I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s not why you tuned in tonight \u2013 you\u2019re here for the jokes. \u201cSo, here we go,\u201d he said, diving into a monologue on Trump\u2019s delusional optimism, though Colbert was slightly less rosy on how America is doing; after months of advising Americans not to wear masks, the CDC announced this weekend that all Americans should wear cloth or fabric face coverings when they go out in public. \u201cWe were supposed to be covering our faces this whole time? Oh my God, Billy Porter tried to warn us!\u201d Colbert said, referencing Porter\u2019s infamous retractable face shield at the 2020 Grammys. \u201cGiven the sudden reversal, this new guidance is a little confusing, but on Friday, the president used his daily briefing to make it even more confusing,\u201d Colbert continued. At a press briefing, Trump called the CDC recommendation \u201cvoluntary\u201d and said that he wouldn\u2019t follow it because he didn\u2019t want to wear a mask. \u201cWell of course Trump is the guy who says he doesn\u2019t want to wear protection,\u201d said Colbert, imitating Trump: \u201cMasks are just the condom of the face \u2013 it kills all the feeling. I mean, there\u2019s a reason I don\u2019t wear a raincoat in the shower or a condom during sex.\u201d Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers turned his Closer Look segment on Trump\u2019s erroneous and irresponsible claims over the past month that the coronavirus would just disappear with warmer weather in April. Asked about this baseless talking point this weekend, in April, Trump dialed down, telling reporters: \u201cI didn\u2019t say a date, I said it\u2019s going away, and it is going away.\u201d \u201cAh, very clever,\u201d Meyers responded. \u201cAfter all, April has 24 days left, and it\u2019s down to, what, I don\u2019t know, 337,000 cases?\u201d Meyers said. (That number has, of course, gone up.) \u201cAnd you did \u2013 you literally said \u2018it goes away in April.\u2019 That\u2019s as close to specific as Trump ever gets. Usually, when you ask him a question, he waves it away like a dad promising his kids a trip to Disneyland while watching football.\u201d Meyers also criticized Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, for his mishandling of the federal stockpile of ventilators. Meyers described Kushner as \u201ceverybody\u2019s favorite botoxed nine-year-old\u201d, and \u201cthe real-life Jack Skellington, the fellow who\u2019s always lurking in the background of every White House photo like a stalker who suddenly appears in the mirror when you close your medicine cabinet. The only guy in the world who creeps out Stephen Miller.\u201d Meyers focused on Kushner\u2019s comments last week at a press briefing: \u201cThe notion of the federal stockpile was, it\u2019s supposed to be our stockpile. It\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles that they then use.\u201d \u201cThat makes sense,\u201d Meyers deadpanned of Kushner\u2019s argument. \u201cIt\u2019s like my doorman told me: \u2018The front door belongs to the building. If you wanna go to work so bad, climb down the fire escape.\u2019 Seriously, it\u2019s your stockpile? Are you writing your name on them like you\u2019re leaving your lunch in the office fridge? \u201cThis sniveling weasel thinks everything belongs to him because he was born into a rich family, just like his father-in-law,\u201d Meyer continued. \u201cI\u2019m shocked we haven\u2019t seen something called a Kushni-lator pop up on Craigslist.\u201d It all leads to one conclusion, according to Meyers: \u201cOne lesson we\u2019re all learning from this is that, generally speaking, it\u2019s better to not be governed by sociopaths.\u201d Trevor Noah On the Daily Social Distancing Show, Trevor Noah addressed Trump\u2019s unproven and dangerous claim that hydroxychloroquine could treat coronavirus. \u201cHere\u2019s what I don\u2019t get: Trump is acknowledging he\u2019s not a doctor, while legitimate doctors who could answer these questions are standing right there next to him,\u201d Noah said. \u201cWhy are we getting his opinion at all? Imagine if you went in for a check-up, and there\u2019s just some random dude behind the counter giving his opinion. \u201cNow, before you get depressed by the fact that America is being led by someone who knows less about medicine than Dr Pepper, there is still a lot of good news out there,\u201d he continued. Numbers of coronavirus deaths in Spain, France and Italy are slowing down. South Korea, which confirmed its first case on the same day as the US, reported only 47 new cases on Sunday, and has fewer than 200 deaths out of a population of 51 million people. But \u201cmaybe the best news of all\u201d, Noah added, was that Netflix might drop a new episode of their hit documentary series Tiger King. \u201cI guess this is how low the bar has gotten for what counts as good news right now,\u201d said Noah. \u201cWe find out there\u2019s more episodes about deranged murderers and people being cruel to animals and we\u2019re like \u2018YES!\u2019\u201d Jimmy Kimmel And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel reflected on Trump\u2019s combative press conferences, such as a clip of Trump lashing out at an Associated Press reporter for asking \u201cwise-guy\u201d questions. \u201cHe\u2019s right, though \u2013 they should phrase these questions in a nicer way,\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cLike, \u2018Mr President, why are you doing such an incredible job of screwing this up?\u201d Trump also announced that he will not follow the revised guidelines from the CDC for all Americans to wear masks in public. \u201cHe said it would be odd for him to greet world leaders with a mask on,\u201d Kimmel explained. \u201cWhich may be true, but what world leaders are coming to visit right now? \u201cWhat is the point of telling people to do something you aren\u2019t doing yourself?\u201d Kimmel wondered. \u201cPersonally, I would love to see the president wearing a mask. Maybe then we could re-dub his voice to make him sound like an actual president.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
