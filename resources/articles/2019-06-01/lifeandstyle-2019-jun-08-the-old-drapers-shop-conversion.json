This former draper\u2019s shop in a quiet street of Victorian terraced houses in west London offered the Magowans the chance to create a bespoke living space. But, more than this, as the history of the house began to reveal itself, the couple and their architect, Patrick Lewis, decided to embrace it and \u2013 quite literally \u2013 weave the narratives of its former occupants through the interiors. The project became a collaboration with a number of textile artists, who created specially designed ribbons that wind their way through the rooms and the levels of the building. One is devoted to a member of the Roberts family, who spent 30 years living here in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. \u201cFrom the second that Patrick told us this had once been a draper\u2019s shop, it was almost inevitable that we would do something with textiles,\u201d says Helen, who used to work in the fashion industry and is now studying and designing textiles. \u201cWhen we met Patrick and started talking about the house it was clear from the start that he was interested in some of the same things as us and that the heritage of the house was going to be an important part of the project.\u201d The Magowans used to live in an apartment in west London\u2019s Baron\u2019s Court, but wanted more space, privacy and their own front door. They also wanted to shape their own interiors rather than buying a ready-made home. When they came across the former draper\u2019s shop it had been carved into two separate apartments by the previous owner. \u201cIt was quite eccentric and strange,\u201d says Andrew, a lawyer for an online fashion company. \u201cJust after we bought it, I went to get the keys and opened the front door and thought, \u2018What have we done?\u2019 There was dust everywhere and it looked such as mess. We just thought, \u2018Oh no, we own this now.\u2019\u201d The discovery of an old shop sign on the front of the house, which had been covered up by a sheet of plywood, was the beginning of a more positive process of revealing the building\u2019s history. Patrick asked the Magowans many conventional questions about how they wanted to live in the house, but he also began to research in detail the lives of the Roberts family. \u201cThe house had been divided up, so the interiors were very disconnected at first,\u201d says Andrew. \u201cOne of the really big issues for us was trying to connect all the spaces together again. We had the idea to commission textile ribbons as a way of adding both physical and metaphorical connections. They also have a sense of movement through time and space.\u201d The original shop front was retained, with the architect designing a fresh entrance hall that leads through to a lounge and a study on the ground floor, painted in a rich blue palette. Upwards, via the new staircase introduced by Patrick, the first floor is the heart of the house, with a spacious, open-plan living area populated with the fruits of the couple\u2019s search for characterful midcentury furniture. The semi-separate kitchen is also on the first floor, towards the rear, with units from Plain English painted in a striking combination of blue and white. Moving towards the top of the house, Patrick designed a double-height master bedroom with a custom \u201csewing box\u201d to one side. Faced with crafted bands of larch and oak, the box hides the master bathroom and also forms the base of a mezzanine that holds Helen\u2019s textiles studio at the summit of the house. Helen and Patrick worked closely to create the brief for the four narrative ribbons that wind their way through the house, tying the levels together while representing the stories of four members of the Roberts family. They commissioned textiles artists Deepa Panchamia, Anna Glover and Jennifer Hollidge to create the ribbons, using a variety of techniques, including digital printing, weaving and hand embroidery. In this way, the house became a curatorial project, introducing fresh threads of visual dynamism, as well as layers of historical narrative. \u201cIt\u2019s now a really successful home for us,\u201d says Helen. \u201cIt\u2019s a great space to live or for having friends over and we really enjoyed finding furniture that has a lived-in feel and some character, without feeling too precious or refined. But it\u2019s also intellectually engaging if you know that these stories are there and can follow the threads. There is this secret world, full of stories, which is waiting to be discovered. But, at the same time, you don\u2019t have to know any of that to just enjoy the house as it is.\u201d patricklewisarchitects.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
