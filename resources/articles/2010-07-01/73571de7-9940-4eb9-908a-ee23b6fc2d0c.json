Two black eyes studied me through the clear plastic tube. I froze and, with a twist, the eyes disappeared and a tawny rump and tail came into view. Clearly satisfied that the danger had passed, the wood mouse went on feeding, scavenging the area at the bottom of the feeder that the birds cannot reach. As I walked round to look at this tiny animal from the other side, it paused for a moment, looked up and sniffed the air, and then went on feeding. I fetched my camera and, obligingly, it kept turning round, showing different aspects. Stretching up inside the tube, it studied me through the topmost feeding hole, then went back down to finish packing itself with grain. Eventually, it climbed back up, peered out cautiously and disappeared up the chain into the cover of the ivy. The wood mouse is essentially nocturnal, so it was surprising to find one out and about in mid-afternoon. We had seen others in the garden from time to time, usually as they dashed from the flower border to grab seed dropped underneath the bird table. Visibly fearful, their lightning raids could be missed by an ill-timed blink. This one seemed free of anxiety. It was in the feeder for more than 10 minutes, and was undeterred by our movement. Perhaps we will not see it again. The garden holds many dangers. The occasional cat is not unobservant. The visiting sparrowhawk will readily take a rodent if it can catch one off guard. Owls hunt nearby at night, and the rooks that populate pines nearby include small mammals in their diet. The long-tailed field mouse, as it's also known, can wreak havoc in the vegetable patch. Yet with such creatures around, there's little need to leave the garden in order to enjoy wildlife."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
