Clad in a Manchester City training kit yesterday, it took a quick-fire rat-a-tat, tripping off King Kev's tongue for the memories to come flooding back. \"People remember us blowing a 12-point lead and losing the championship,\" he said, \"or spending \u00a360m and not winning anything. But think of winning the first 11 games of a season; of beating Manchester United 5-0; of buying Andy Cole; of selling Andy Cole; of buying Alan Shearer. What about David Ginola, Faustino Asprilla, Peter Beardsley, Philippe Albert?\" \"But when this draw was made,\" Keegan admitted, \"my first reaction was: 'Oh no. I don't really want to take a team back there.' \"Newcastle means a lot to me. My father was a Geordie born and bred, my grandfather was in the Stanley pit disaster in 1909, and Newcastle was the last club I played for and the first I managed. \"Strangely enough, the very thing that has got Newcastle alive again is the emotion of Bobby [Robson]. Kenny Dalglish seemed to have the right credentials to turn things round, Ruud Gullit too, but maybe you need that connection with the fans at Newcastle more than any other football club. \"The Geordies saw me as someone who gave them what they wanted - attractive, attacking football. Someone said to me that my side used to score four goals every match but concede five. I never lost a game 5-4, but that's what we created, this legend. The reality was that defensively we were quite good. In the season we finished second behind United we had the third best defensive record in the Premiership. \"At City I don't have a head start because my family don't come from Manchester and I never played for the club. The supporters are more suspicious of me. Not in a nasty way, but they ask themselves: 'Why's this guy come here? What's his connection with this club?' At Newcastle I was one of them.\" Keegan's Newcastle ran away with the First Division title nine years ago to cap his first full season in charge, scoring 92 goals along the way. His Citizens have already managed 74 this term to sit three points clear with 14 games to play. Comparison is inevitable. \"It cost \u00a340m net to take Newcastle from second bottom in the First Division to second top of the Premiership,\" he added. \"If I went to any club and said 'give me \u00a38m a year and I'll take you from where you are to where we got', they'd look at me in disbelief. But I believe we can reach the same destination here at City. \"I want to win, make no mistake. If we play to our potential, and if Newcastle are not quite as on the ball as recently, there's no reason why we cannot cause an upset. Then I can go over to Bobby Robson and say 'hey, I hope you go on and win the Premiership', because I genuinely do.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
