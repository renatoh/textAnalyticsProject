Megan Smith is a 21-year-old wannabe serious journalist whose idealism gets her fired from her job at a tabloid magazine. For reasons that remain unclear to me even after repeated viewings, she and her ex-editor deter-mine that the path to a Pulitzer lies in Palm Beach, so off she goes to stay with the Limoges family to tutor the dilettante 16-year-old twins therein, who are so rich that even though they are called Rose and Sage, nobody has yet kicked their faces in at high school. Their grandmother is set on the twins carrying on family tradition and getting into Duke University. As they are currently attending more photoshoots than Sats and Taser their new tutor when she tries to rouse them from slumber before noon, hopes initially do not run high. But if Megan can bring them into their Dukedom, she will both save the fragrant duo from a life of wretched vapidity and have her college debts paid off by grandma. Fortunately, Megan has two (unlike Gossip Girl, age-appropriate) love interests and a kindly camp household chef to support her in her endeavours, and by the end of the episode it emerges that Rose may not be entirely hostile to a spot of book-larnin', provided it's delivered perkily enough. This should not be a problem, as the wide-eyed actress (Joanna Garcia) playing Megan has enough pep for a thousand lifetimes. It's as if an entire team of cheerleaders has been compressed into one tiny frame. The plotting would disgrace a Bunty comic strip, but the programme sparkles gamely on. Ultimately, you have to warm to a show that has Megan signal the depths of a sisterly betrayal with the words \"Think Brutus. Judas. Brangelina.\" As the last fiery trails of the glittering Gossip Girl starburst fade overhead, it will at least provide a glimmer of light in the darkness."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
