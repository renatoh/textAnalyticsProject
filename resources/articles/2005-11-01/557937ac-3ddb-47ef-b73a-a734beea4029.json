Royalties from Mrs Blair's book, The Goldfish Bowl: Married to the Prime Minister 1955-1997, are registered, along with fees for speaking engagements in Washington, Australia and New Zealand - although no figures are recorded. The entry follows recent criticism of Cherie Blair for accepting \u00a317,000 for speaking at an event which left an Australian charity out of pocket. Tony Blair also registers his long summer holiday at Sir Cliff Richard's villa in the West Indies this August, but stresses that the holiday was not a \"freebie\". \"Accompanied by my family I spent 26 nights at a private villa in Barbados owned by Sir Cliff Richard. I have made a charitable donation in lieu of the cost of this accommodation. I paid for all other expenses including flights\", he writes in the register. Ex-Tory leader William Hague, tipped to become shadow foreign secretary if David Cameron wins the Tory leadership, faces losing out on more than \u00a3500,000 a year if he does return to frontline politics, the register reveals. Mr Hague's popular after-dinner speeches earned him at least \u00a3385,000 in the past year, and his regular newspaper columns at least \u00a3190,000. He would come under pressure to give up these lucrative sources of income. Fellow Tory MP and Spectator editor Boris Johnson could also be left counting the cost of a return to the front benches. Mr Johnson, who was forced to resign amid the fallout from an affair with one of his columnists, confirmed today that he is leaving the Spectator to rededicate himself to his political career. The end of his editorship and the loss of his newspaper column would cost him at least \u00a370,000 a year. Respect MP George Galloway was a Westminster high earner, receiving up to \u00a380,000 for a regular newspaper column. Mr Galloway, who took the Bethnal Green and Bow seat from his former party Labour, has received book advances of up to \u00a335,000 and up to \u00a325,000 for media appearances. The MP, who missed a Commons vote on anti-terror legislation because of a speaking engagement on a day that the government's majority was cut to just one, also earned up to \u00a315,000 for 15 events. Nick Raynsford became director and deputy chairman of the Construction Industry Council just a month after standing down as local government minister. Mr Raynsford, whose previous responsibilities included the fire service, also receives up to \u00a310,000 as chair of the Fire Protection Association Council, and up to \u00a310,000 for articles. Chancellor Gordon Brown lists two Virgin Atlantic upgrades for him, his wife and their son. Among outgoing Tory leader Michael Howard's declarations is a Christmas hamper from the Sultan of Brunei. Far more extensive are the entries from his nemesis Ann Widdecombe, who famously said there was \"something of the night\" about the former home secretary. Ms Widdecombe records \u00a3100,000 \"plus performance bonuses\" for her third and fourth books. The Maidstone and The Weald MP was paid up to \u00a310,000 by ITV to take part in Celebrity Fit Club. She earned up to another \u00a3130,000 more for other media appearances and articles and is a director of gift retailer Merry Monks Editions. Iain Duncan Smith declares assistance from the Conservative party with legal bills incurred while he was leader. He also registers tickets for the Royal Opera House and Wimbledon. Labour backbencher Diane Abbott earned up to \u00a385,000 from TV appearances, newspaper articles and speaking engagements. Tony Baldry, former Tory chair of the Commons international development committee, lists 13 directorships and an executive partnership in a film and TV company. Tory turncoat Shaun Woodward, whose wealth has been a source of friction with some of his Labour colleagues, lists an estate in Oxfordshire, flats in France and London, a house in New York state and a plot of land in the West Indies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
