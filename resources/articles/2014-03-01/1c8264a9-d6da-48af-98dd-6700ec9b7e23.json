Fresh out of the clink, he runs a marathon, breaking a record, no less. But seemingly prize money and fame aren't reward enough for this adrenalin junkie, and he resumes robbing banks. It's just as well the film declares from the off that it's based on a true story, because the premise seems ridiculous. Writer-director Benjamin Heisenberg makes no attempt to provide any kind of psychological backstory, a move both bold and frustrating, but he does have a real knack for illustrating Rettenberger's compulsive kineticism and savage determination. Lust looks permanently drained of blood, but is clearly, judging by all that dashing about, as fit as a butcher's dog. He can't, however, stop this overly oblique work from becoming something of an endurance test."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
