As many as 3,000 Vietnamese children are thought to have been trafficked to Britain to work in cannabis farms and nail bars, and are often housed in atrocious conditions. Overall, the government scientific adviser has suggested there may be as many as 13,000 victims in the UK. Vietnam is the fourth biggest source country of people trafficked to the UK. Cameron will also announce on Wednesday, during the first visit by a British prime minister to Vietnam, that the independent anti-slavery commissioner, Kevin Hyland, will lead a fact-finding mission to the country this autumn to identify what more the UK can do to defeat human traffickers. In a report published this week on human trafficking worldwide, the US State Department found that: \u201cVietnamese organised crime networks recruit and transport Vietnamese nationals, especially children, to Europe \u2013 particularly the United Kingdom and Ireland \u2013 and subject them to forced labour on cannabis farms; they are lured with promises of lucrative jobs and compelled into servitude through debt bondage. \u201cVietnam\u2019s labour export companies \u2013 many affiliated with state-owned enterprises \u2013 sometimes charge fees in excess of the law for work abroad, leaving workers with exorbitant debts and vulnerable to forced labour and debt bondage.\u201d Cameron is due to say: \u201cIt is shocking that thousands of Vietnamese children in the UK are being used for profit by criminal gangs and that dozens more children are estimated to arrive on our shores every month. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that we work with Vietnam to identify what more we can do to tackle this issue together.\u201d The idea of an annual statement came from NGOs during the Modern Slavery Act\u2019s passage through parliament. Although it will be permissible for companies to say they have done nothing to check their supply chain for suspicion of human slavery, the government believes a statement making such an admission would lead to the company being named and shamed into action. The proposal fits with Cameron\u2019s theme of producing change through transparency. His announcement comes in the week that previously trialled proposals in the act come into force, including trafficking reparation orders that encourage the courts to use seized assets to compensate victims, and prevention orders to ensure those who present a risk of committing modern slavery offences cannot work in relevant fields, such as with children or as gang masters. Much of the research into modern slavery in the UK has been conducted by the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) thinktank, which has shown that some Vietnamese children trafficked often do not know which country they have been sent to and are so terrified of being abused that they refuse to reveal their circumstances. This silence, coupled with widespread lack of awareness among law enforcement agencies, has, the CSJ warned, \u201cled to an appalling reality whereby children who have been enslaved are then being imprisoned\u201d. Hyland, who was appointed as anti-slavery commissioner last November, said: \u201cI am very pleased that the prime minister has rightly recognised the trafficking of Vietnamese children and adults to the UK as a high-priority issue. Modern slavery is often international organised crime, and it can only be combatted through strong partnerships between source, transit and destination countries.\u201d Hyland will look at what programmes can be set up in rural parts of Vietnam, where many vulnerable children and adults are targeted by the traffickers. He said key responsibilities lie with UK authorities to target Vietnamese criminal gangs that ruthlessly exploit Vietnamese children in multiple ways to maximise the profit that can be gained from them. This includes forced labour in cannabis factories and nail bars, as well as an increasingly diverse range of exploitative activities, as gangs move into other areas of crime."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
