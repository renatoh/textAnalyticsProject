Macron, who has also made overtures to financial firms seeking a possible exit from London once Britain has left the EU, made his comments during a three-day trip to India. As Macron spoke at an event in New Delhi on Saturday, his official Twitter account sent out a series of tweets in English saying he wanted to make France into India\u2019s \u201cfirst strategic partner in Europe\u201d. One tweet said: \u201cWe are at the beginning of a new momentum between France and India.\u201d Another sought to tempt overseas Indian students, many of whom have traditionally studied in the UK, to head to France instead. The tweet said: \u201cI want to double the number of Indian students coming to France. If you choose France you gain access to francophonie, you gain access to Europe.\u201d It was to this message that Johnson responded, albeit a day late. He tweeted in reply: \u201cWe are proud too to have more than 14,000 Indian students coming to the UK in 2017 \u2013 up a quarter over last year \u2013 choosing the home of the greatest universities, including four of the global top ten.\u201d He ended with the tag #educationisgreatinenglish. Johnson\u2019s intervention indicates the wariness of ministers about EU nations seeking to capitalise on the UK\u2019s changed status with the rest of Europe after Brexit. Overseas students provide a huge economic input to the economy, with Universities UK estimating they contribute about \u00a325bn a year and support about 200,000 jobs around the UK. The number of overseas students has caused tensions within the government, however, with ministers continuing to count them in immigration targets despite official figures showing that hardly any stay on after their visa expires. Macron flew to India late on Friday with a clear message for his hosts. \u201cFrance is the entry point to Europe. We want to be India\u2019s best partner in Europe,\u201d he said after meeting the prime minister, Narendra Modi. Macron\u2019s office said French and Indian companies had signed contracts worth \u20ac13bn (\u00a311.5bn) on the first full day of the trip, including a contract for the aviation firm Safran to supply the airline Spice Jet with engines, and a contract between the industrial gas company Air Liquide and Sterlite."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
