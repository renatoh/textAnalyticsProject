At the launch of the new business section were retail billionaire Philip Green, Clinton charity donor Tom Hunter, Boots chairman Nigel Rudd, Post Office chairman Allan Leighton, Cazenove banker David Mayhew, former Asda boss and Tory MP Archie Norman, and perennial partygoer Piers Morgan. \u00b7 New City editor Will Lewis charmed in his short speech, but someone should have warned him never to pose a question to a room full of journalists. Spouting off about the revamp, the youthful Lewis concluded: \"Why would you want to work anywhere else?\" One wag responded: \"Money!\" \u00b7 Olympic rower James Cracknell was desperately scouting the room for M&amp;S chief Stuart Rose. Due to meet Marks reps the next day to persuade them to sponsor his row across the Atlantic in November, the blond-tipped gold medallist hoped a chat with Rose would seal the deal. But it's probably just as well Cracknell couldn't find the man he was referring to as Stuart Green ... \u00b7 Joining Cracknell in the pantheon of adventure-seekers is Barclays Africa boss Dominic Bruynseels, who bungee-jumped for charity at Victoria Falls yesterday. Our spies report Mr Bruynseels was one of the most graceful jumpers ever seen in those parts, and didn't even scream. Bruynseels described the experience as \"very exhilarating\". We can't wait for Barclays chief operating officer Paul Idzik to top this stunt. \u00b7 On the subject of banks and philanthropy, HSBC isn't taking chances with security ahead of Prince William's arrival at its charity division next month. In a surprise drill, the bank evacuated the 8,000 staff at its Canary Wharf offices on Monday. \"You've got to feel sorry for the poor souls on the 43rd floor who had to walk down 120 flights of stairs,\" one employee observed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
