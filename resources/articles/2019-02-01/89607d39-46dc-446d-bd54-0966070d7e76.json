So adamant that he seems a bit angry about it. Take England\u2019s last match against France. In the second half, Sinckler snapped and slapped the flanker Arthur Iturria on the top of his head. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to do it, is there?\u201d the referee, Nigel Owens, told Sinckler after he had given a penalty against him. A week later, Sinckler says he is still feeling \u201ca bit frustrated about the whole incident\u201d. Owens did not see that Iturria had taken a cheap shot at Sinckler first. \u201cI didn\u2019t just smack him on the head,\u201d Sinckler says. \u201cThere was stuff that happened before, but I don\u2019t want to dwell on it.\u201d Sinckler has said previously: \u201cI only know how to play the game one way \u2013 angry.\u201d If he is not careful, his temper will get England into trouble sooner or later. He was lucky Owens did not show him a card. He knows that next time the referee might not be so generous, or England so far in front, since they were 36 points up when it happened. So he is working on it. \u201cThe big lesson is that I\u2019d done my job in terms of counter-rucking, he lost his cool, and I needed to move on instead of retaliating,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a good lesson to learn. Just back off.\u201d It is a good time to learn it too, approaching a crucial match against Wales, when there is sure to be a lot of needle between the teams. The last time England played in Cardiff, in 2017, Sinckler played the last 10 minutes, he remembers that \u201cthe atmosphere was electric. The Wales national anthem gets the hairs on the back of your neck standing up just with the passion from the fans.\u201d England won that one, 21-16. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hostile, as you would expect, but it is all good fun,\u201d he says. \u201cYou see all the Welsh flags going in and everyone giving you a bit of abuse, which is good fun.\u201d All of which means, Sinckler says: \u201cI have to make sure I am in control and I don\u2019t let the emotions get the better of me.\u201d But, at the same time, he does not want to compromise that manic energy of his. \u201cIf you are part of the front row and playing in the forward pack it is always going to be a fine line. The main thing is just not letting it get in the way of the main goal which is the team winning.\u201d That goes back to something Eddie Jones taught him. \u201cHe\u2019s got to understand that the team comes before the individual,\u201d Jones said in 2017. \u201cThat\u2019ll be the big thing for him.\u201d Sinckler is on message, here. \u201cWe can\u2019t lose sleep over what Wales are going to do. All we are focused on is preparing as best as we can and focusing on our game plan and implementing it.\u201d He and his teammates seem to be trying very hard to make sure they do not say, or do, anything in the run-up to the match to give Wales any extra motivation. Jones has described this as \u201cthe greatest Welsh side ever\u201d and his England players are pretty much refusing to talk about the opposition at all. \u201cWe\u2019ll just focus on ourselves,\u201d Sinckler says. If that is his approach, it has been working for him. In the past year, Sinckler has grown into the player he always had the potential to be. He finally started a match for England when they lost to Ireland last March, and since then has again in nine games out of 10. His hard-charging style, all crashing runs and smashing tackles, helps set the tone for an England team that are playing with ferocious intensity. He has ball skills, too, honed when he was playing in the backs for his old club team Battersea Ironsides, and against France he set up a try for Henry Slade with a pass he delivered from scrum-half. Sinckler has become a gamebreaker. Which is what he wants to be. \u201cI don\u2019t worry about numbers and stats,\u201d he says. \u201cI would rather have six or seven effective tackles rather than 12 soak-up tackles.\u201d It annoys him, he says, when people talk about how many carries a player has made. \u201cI can get the ball and just drop to the floor and that counts as a carry. Are you running on to the ball with momentum? Are you drawing a defender? Are you denting the line? I would rather have five good carries rather than 15 average ones. \u201cMy focus is not just making 10 carries this week, it is about were the carries effective? Did I manipulate the line? Did I use my hands? Was I running on to the ball?\u201d Get that right, he says, and everything else will take care of itself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
