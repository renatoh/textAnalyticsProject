Over the next few days, some of the biggest corporate names in the US - Coca-Cola, Ford and International Business Machines - will issue third quarter profit reports, and investors are expecting good news. Predictions have been the most positive of the year so far, reinforcing optimism that growth will be fast enough to sustain this year's 18% advance in the Standard &amp; Poor's index of the 500 largest companies in the US. Evidence that the US economy is finally creating jobs is adding to market confidence. In official data last week, the US unexpectedly added jobs in September. Weekly jobless claims in the week ending October 4 fell by more than economists had forecast. \"We realise there have been false starts in the past,\" said Deutsche Bank in a briefing note. \"But conditions today are better than this time last year, when employment growth improved temporarily. \"Consumers remain resilient, the stock market has maintained its recent gains, and the manufacturing sector is holding its own.\" In London, the FTSE-100 finished up 51.3 points, or 1.2%, at 4,362.3 points, its highest close since late August last year. UK shares were boosted by companies that do well at the start of an economic recovery - typically firms in the mining sector, as demand for metals rises in an upturn. Mining stocks rose strongly in London, with BHP Billiton, Anglo American and Rio Tinto all up by about 3%. \"It is a cyclical story. People are buying the recovery. The dollar is steady, metals prices are at multi-year highs, and people are looking for an upturn in commodities again,\" one trader told Reuters. In another boost to shares, insurer Royal &amp; SunAlliance gained more than 3% on optimism that its rights issue - the issuance of new shares to raise capital - will be well supported. Prudential, another insurer, also rose after being upgraded by analysts at Smith Barney."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
