It was the height of the Aids crisis and she was in the waiting room of an inner-city STI clinic, frequented by those most at risk of HIV: gay men, injecting drug users, sex workers. Not, as she had been, a monogamous married businesswoman. She had felt \u201ctoo ashamed\u201d to ask her doctor for the HIV test. A positive result, back then, would have been a death sentence. In the clinic a friendly gay counsellor asked Megan to step into his room and asked her if everything was OK. No, she said. No, it absolutely was not. \u201cThat\u2019s when I lost the plot,\u201d Megan, now 52, tells me as we sit in a gastrobar on a rainy Sydney evening. \u201cThis poor gay guy was the target for all my built-up anger.\u201d Megan threw her chair across the room at the petrified counsellor, first screaming, then crying, then sobbing, until \u2013 now outside Sydney\u2019s Albion Street clinic \u2013 she vomited on the street. People gave her a cautious, wide berth. Her worried dad was on his way to pick up his distraught daughter, now lying in the gutter, covered in her own tears and vomit. \u201cAt that moment, a homeless man I\u2019d stepped over on the way in reached out to gently check in on me,\u201d Megan says, crying. She softened; it was the first tender moment she\u2019d experienced in a period of terrifying isolation. \u201cI\u2019ve never forgotten him,\u201d Megan says. As her dad pulled up she opened her purse, fat with notes, and pushed them all into the bewildered man\u2019s hands before being whisked home. Megan is one of a potentially dying breed of women: those who married closeted gay men. As countries such as Australia and Britain progress towards LGBTQI equality, it\u2019s a social phenomenon that could vaporise within a generation. When a married man comes out later in life, positive reactions can be heartening. Rainbow garlands are unfurled. People applaud his bravery. They empathise with his struggle. They marvel at how he came through it and celebrate that he can finally be himself. They express gratitude we live in more enlightened times. Often entirely missing from this narrative is the woman\u2019s voice. She has had to face her marriage breakdown and potential infidelity and wrestle with feelings that her relationship was a sham. Then there\u2019s the judgment of others who, sometimes openly, say surely she must have suspected \u2013 how naive can a person be? Occasionally she is blamed for being the person holding the man back from who he truly is or wants to be. Just one service in Australia specifically exists to help these women: the Women Partners of Bisexual Men service, run by the Leichhardt Women\u2019s Centre in Sydney. It\u2019s believed to be one of the only government-funded services of its kind in the world. To mark its 25th anniversary, the service is releasing a new book, There\u2019s Something I Have To Tell You, featuring 20 stories from the women\u2019s perspective. One hundred women of all ages and backgrounds use the service, comprising group support and specialised individual counselling. One woman, Annabel, flies to Sydney from Melbourne fortnightly especially for the peer group sessions. \u201cA few times I was in foetal position bawling and had drank too much wine,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I was extremely grateful for the group.\u201d Roxanne McMurray has been running the support service for 19 years. Daily she hears \u201cheartbreaking stories\u201d like Megan\u2019s. She says women present with depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, high blood pressure, eating issues and fears their children will be bullied. \u201cSome women contact the service before their husband is even aware they know he\u2019s gay,\u201d she says. \u201cSome women found out because they were diagnosed with HIV or another STI. And yes, some women say the group saved their lives; they were suicidal when they contacted us.\u201d Megan says a service like this would have been a \u201clifesaver\u201d. She suffered a nervous breakdown after discovering her husband\u2019s secret. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have our daughter, Lucy, I can understand how you\u2019d be suicidal after that level of deception,\u201d she says. Steven, Megan\u2019s husband, had been a high-flying, jet-setting schmoozer who rose from a socially conservative family in Sydney\u2019s western suburbs to be a financial director on a seven-figure salary. He first met Megan, his second wife, when she was 22 and he was 26. After their first date, he sent four dozen roses to her work. \u201cIt was OTT but I was swept away,\u201d Megan says. \u201cI grew up with real Aussie blokes \u2013 this was something I\u2019d never experienced.\u201d After their wedding, when the couple were living in Hong Kong for work, Steven pushed her to have a baby, even though she wasn\u2019t entirely happy in the relationship. Never once did she suspect he was gay. \u201cWe had a pretty normal healthy sex life, it\u2019s not like it was once a year. If I had a dollar for everyone who asked: are you sure you didn\u2019t know?\u201d she says, sighing. Eight weeks after their daughter Lucy was born, the relationship nosedived. \u201cI thought he was having an affair, and created a big fight to get it out of him,\u201d she says. \u201cFinally he said, \u2018I\u2019m not attracted to you, I have some feelings towards men. I\u2019m not gay but really confused and I think I need you to move back to Australia so I can work myself out.\u2019\u201d Through tears, Megan describes her world collapsing. \u201cI was a woman deranged,\u201d she says. \u201cI was devastated, yet somehow also relieved the problem wasn\u2019t me, as he\u2019d often made me feel.\u201d On the plane home, she took stock. \u201cIn 24 hours I lost my husband, marriage, home, friends, support group, career. And I had an eight-week-old baby.\u201d She later discovered her husband was on a flight the next day to the Caribbean with his male lover. \u201cHe was a pathological liar,\u201d Megan says. \u201cI was so angry \u2013 I could understand how a woman could kill her husband.\u201d A year later, Megan realised she needed to let go of the anger when she collapsed with internal bleeding caused by a stress-related ulcer. \u201cI decided to stop hating him,\u201d she says. Steven got a new boyfriend, who Megan adored. \u201cHe was a beautiful man, and wonderful to my daughter Lucy,\u201d she says. Both Steven and his partner died of Aids-related illnesses. Clearly distraught, Megan stops the interview as she describes watching the men become paraplegic, then die. \u201cSuch a waste. Me and my daughter are so sad,\u201d she says. Lucy, now 24, hid at school the fact her dad was gay. \u201cNow she\u2019d be the coolest kid in school,\u201d Megan says. \u201cThey\u2019d go shopping; they\u2019d have a ball.\u201d But she admits to hoping for a deathbed confession. \u201cI always dreamed I\u2019d finally get the truth. Why marry me? I don\u2019t believe in bisexuality, I think he was gay,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you love someone and you know you\u2019re gay, you don\u2019t marry them. That\u2019s wrong, to me.\u201d Megan\u2019s experience chimes with many of the moving stories in the new book, which aims to increase the reach of the Women Partners of Bisexual Men service \u2013 it will be sent to counsellors, family relationship services and lawyers across Australia. Common themes emerge from their 20 stories. More than once the phrase appears that \u201che stole my life\u201d. One woman, Beth, describes the discovery as \u201c17 years stolen from me\u201d. The physical impact of the sheer shock on these women is confronting. Lucy\u2019s hair fell out, she had tremors and experienced dramatic weight loss. \u201cEveryone was telling me how great I looked!\u201d she writes. \u201cI kept thinking: I\u2019m dying. The only man who\u2019d ever been attracted to me actually hadn\u2019t been, so all those horrible thoughts I\u2019d felt about myself were actually true.\u201d Some describe feeling like widows; the men they knew were apparitions. And many of the men, emboldened by the sense of freedom and fresh excitement afforded them by discovering the gay scene, completely transformed. Amal describes the impact it had on her children. \u201cMy sons\u2019 friends would come over and ask, is your dad gay? The way he walked, sat, smiled, dressed \u2013 all changed.\u201d Many times the women are left questioning: who is he; did I ever really know him? Those who were gaslighted describe relief that they weren\u2019t, after all, going mad for suspecting. Others, convinced the problem was their own inadequacy, describe similar complex relief. But that relief is often accompanied by anger. Several women, half-jokingly, discuss hiring hitmen. When Amal discovered her husband had been bringing his secret boyfriend of five years to the house \u2013 even to sit at family dinners under the guise of a friend \u2013 she \u201ccalled him a disgusting creature\u201d, she writes. \u201cThey\u2019re manipulative because they\u2019re ashamed of who they are, but the woman pays the price.\u201d The insensitivity of celebrating the man\u2019s coming out is something many women grapple with. \u201cI get angry because everyone\u2019s said to him how fantastic, aren\u2019t you courageous, what a hero,\u201d writes Beth. \u201cI wanted to beat the living shit out of him for what he did to our family. There were no repercussions for him. My anger was mind-blowing.\u201d Similarly, Patricia took issue with the blokes who took her husband out for a beer so they didn\u2019t look homophobic. \u201cIf he\u2019d shot me, would they take him out for a beer?\u201d she asks. \u201cThat\u2019s what it felt like.\u201d Other people\u2019s positive reactions to the coming out can cause unintended pain, such as in Lucy\u2019s case. Her husband\u2019s parents responded by saying he would always be their son. \u201cThat hit me hard,\u201d she admits. \u201cI realised yes, he\u2019d always be their son. But I wouldn\u2019t be their daughter any more.\u201d Some reactions are more surprising. Service manager Roxanne says a post-disclosure honeymoon period can happen, and sex begins again because it brings back emotional intimacy. Such was the case for Madeleine. \u201cInterestingly, after it came out, we had a brief spurt of sex together. The first time it happened, I cried. It had been eight years.\u201d Just like many gay men do, their wives can go through denial periods, Roxanne says, believing they can work things out. For some like Val, they make a conscious or practical decision to stay; her husband was 72 when she found out. Pam, whose main concern upon discovering was protecting her husband from losing his friends, also concedes she\u2019ll probably stay with him. For her, it\u2019s all about sacrificing one thing to get something else \u2013 in this case, a continuing family for her children. \u201cI know my husband is gay, he can\u2019t stop himself from being with men, it\u2019s impossible. I\u2019m realistic. We talk a lot.\u201d Elizabeth is reflective on how she ended up with her husband. \u201cThere\u2019s a stereotype that closeted men seek out a certain type of woman because we have qualities of acceptance, tolerance, understanding, empathy \u2013 but even if it\u2019s true, you don\u2019t want to feel like you\u2019re gullible,\u201d she writes. She even picked him up from his first date with a man. Her anger wasn\u2019t at him, but at his family and culture for not letting him be who he should have been in the first place: \u201cIt was like he didn\u2019t know how to be gay.\u201d Roxanne remembers, as Australia\u2019s marriage equality postal vote was happening, clients contacting the service asking: have you done it yet, have you voted? I ask her if any were no voters, given their experiences. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were enthusiastic about creating a new world \u2013 so no other woman would go through what they did.\u201d Megan Holgate relates to that. She remembers being unable to go to Mardi Gras one year her colleagues invited her, as the sight of two men kissing was just too distressing. Today she cheers such affection: \u201cI think, go for it. You\u2019ve met someone you love; that\u2019s what makes the world go round.\u201d Roxanne challenges me when I put it to her that this could soon be a social phenomenon of the past. \u201cI think that\u2019s a long way off,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople still go to beats [public places where gay men meet discretely for sex]. People still have private parts of themselves which don\u2019t always coexist honestly with their public life.\u201d On that point, I recall the book\u2019s most poignant line. It comes from Lucy, who \u2013 in her acute distress \u2013 did the most intrusive thing a person can do to invade another\u2019s privacy: she found and read her husband\u2019s teenage diary. She knew it wasn\u2019t right, but was desperate for explanations. \u201cThe way he described the boys: \u2018he\u2019s very handsome\u2019, \u2018he\u2019s very muscular\u2019. He probably didn\u2019t know he was gay at the time,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt broke my heart to read the diary of a sweet young boy on the verge of making the wrong choice. \u201cAnd that choice was me.\u201d To contact The Women Partners of Bisexual Men Service, call 1800 787 887 or email info@womenpartners.org.au"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
