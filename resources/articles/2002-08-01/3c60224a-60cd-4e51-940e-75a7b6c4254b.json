The scene literally cries out for a killer send-off line, something like, \"There are stranger things in this world than you have dreamed of in all your philosophy, Jack,\" or \"What I know about your personal life and fifty cents will buy me a cup of coffee\". But instead the director and assorted screenwriters just leave Affleck's question hanging in the air and allow the enigmatic Russkie to trundle off into the sunset. In doing so, they have made a very wise choice. Since the previous 123 minutes of this insanely confusing film don't contain any good lines, there's no point in starting at this late stage. And, to be perfectly fair, good dialogue wouldn't do much to bail out The Sum Of All Fears - a Phil Alden Robinson film. Based on an ordnance-heavy novel by Tom Clancy, the film deals with a nuclear attack on Baltimore, seemingly carried out by the Soviet Union. But appearances can be deceiving, because nuclear weapons are turning up everywhere these days. Perhaps the armed strike is an attempt by disgruntled right-wingers from central Europe to make the Russians look bad and lead to a nuclear showdown with the United States. Perhaps the bomb was dredged up from a Middle East crater and once belonged to the Israelis. Perhaps all this has something to do with Chechnya. Perhaps Tom Clancy is so upset by the end of the cold war that he would cook up any plotline imaginable to get the Soviets back into the picture. In fact, the book made more sense than the movie because the villains were Islamic fundamentalists. Here they are well-financed Nazis. Presumably, the events of September 11, 2001 had something to do with this subtle plot alteration. In The Sum Of All Fears - a Phil Alden Robinson film - it is hardly encouraging that the only man who stands between the United States and a full-blown nuclear holocaust is Ben Affleck. Affable and well-meaning, Affleck lacks the moral authority of an Alec Baldwin (The Hunt For Red October) or Harrison Ford (Patriot Games, Clear And Present Danger), who preceded him in the role of Jack Ryan in Clancy's long-running series, and he does not seem quite sharp enough to pass as a CIA expert on internal Russian affairs. While he is nowhere near as ridiculous as Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist in The World Is Not Enough or Keanu Reeves as a cold-fusion specialist in Chain Reaction, he is in that same general ballpark. Despite, or perhaps because of, the World Trade Centre massacre and America's fear of a nuclear strike from terrorists, The Sum Of All Fears - a Phil Alden Robinson film - has done quite well at the US box office. This may be because Baltimore is a complete dump and no one would miss it much if it were levelled by a nuclear weapon. It is notable that no one in the movie seems to get terribly worked up about the holocaust in Crabcake Corners, nor does anyone bother to explain why the forces of evil chose this dying industrial city on the banks of the Chesapeake as a target rather than New York, Washington, or even Las Vegas. If I were a native of the state, I would already be composing an angry letter to the Times. The Sum Of All Fears - a Phil Alden Robinson film - is one of those movies that is not particularly good but nowhere near as bad as it could have been. On the positive side is Morgan Freeman's performance as a sleek, morally obtuse CIA honcho who serves as Affleck's mentor: a man to Affleck's boy. James Cromwell does his usual fine work as the President of the United States, a role he has now played about 600 times. Those who saw him as the duplicitous police chief in LA Confidential know that he has a great deal more range than he is usually asked to display in roles such as this, but on balance he does a superb job here. Liev Schreiber is miscast as a CIA assassin; Ron Rifkin plays the nebbish he always plays; a confederacy of hams play the Russians and White House flunkies. The only other performer of note is Alan Bates, who surfaces as a mysterious fascist with connections everywhere. Oh well, it's a payday. The Sum Of All Fears - a Phil Alden Robinson film - hinges on the premise that the unknown Ryan can persuade both the Russians and the United States to call off the dogs of war and send their ICBMs back to their silos. This is an implausible proposition, as there is never a moment when Affleck actually looks like the kind of person that heads of state would pay attention to. The Sum Of All Fears - a Phil Alden Robinson film - is the kind of movie where people yammer on cell phones while running across tarmacs to create the illusion that something important is happening. But the only important thing that happens is the scene where Baltimore gets nuked, an event which, as noted, does not seem to make anybody terribly upset. Whenever I have seen a print or television ad or preview for The Sum Of All Fears, it is always pointed out that this is a \"Phil Alden Robinson\" film. Ten years ago I did a rigorously scientific study for Movieline proving that with the exception of Steven Spielberg, Woody Allen and a handful of others, nobody really knows or cares who made the movie they are seeing, particularly if it is based on a Tom Clancy novel. For all the public cares, the film could have been directed by a Bovril jar. Mr Robinson (Field Of Dreams) is not Alfred Hitchcock, or Truffaut or Fellini, and he is certainly not Cecil B DeMille. Phil Alden Robinson needs to get over himself. \u00b7 The Sum Of All Fears is out now"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
