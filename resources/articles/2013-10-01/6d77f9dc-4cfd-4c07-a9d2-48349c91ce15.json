By the time Joshua entered the ring to Kanye West it was nearly midnight, but luckily for those at the O2 Arena, he was in no mood to hang about. He staggered Leo several times with right crosses and while the Italian marched forward gamely, the effect was rather like watching a World War One soldier walking into a battery of machine-gun fire. A series of concussive punches ended it 2min 47sec into the first round. \"This was just as important as winning the Olympics,\" said Joshua. \"And I ended it in spectacular fashion. I had been out of the ring for 14 months but I've built a really strong team around me.\" Leo had not tasted defeat in his eight professional contests, but his was a record as puffy as his midsection. The combined record of the Italian's opponents \u2013 37 wins, 19 draws and 170 losses - told you about his level, and his two contests since 2010 spoke just as eloquently about his preparation. But Joshua still had to get him out. And that is what he did \u2013 in powerful and impressive fashion. Not that he is getting carried away. \"I'd love to be in the heavyweight mix but I've got a long way to go to get there,\" he admitted. \"We'll gauge my progress as I keep winning and keep learning in the gym and we'll see what I am ready for fight-by-fight. I don't want to promise things I can't deliver. I don't want to talk much trash. I want to back things up. It's going to be a tough road and hard work but I'm going to put the work in.\" In the co-headliner, Scott Quigg retained his WBA super-bantamweight title after rallying to secure a majority draw with the Miami-based Cuban Yoandris Salinas. The 24-year-old was handed the world title by the WBA rather than winning it in the ring, having previously held their interim title, and had pledged he wouldn't touch the belt until he had won it properly. But after a determined late effort he was rightly delighted to see it draped around his waist. One judge, Ruben Garcia, gave him the fight by a margin of 115-113. The two others made it 114-114, making the fight a technical draw, much to Quigg's disappointment. \"I feel I won the fight by two rounds,\" he said. \"I stuck to my gameplan. I knew he would be sharp early on, and I'm gutted I didn't get the win. He had 300 amateur fights, I had 12 but I feel I showed that I belong at world level.\" Initially, Salinas's low hands and fast jabs offered a conundrum that Quigg seemed unable to solve. During the first half of the fight the action arrived only intermittently and, when it came, it was on Salinas's terms. But slowly, Quigg was gaining control. In the eighth a cuffing right hand knocking Salinas off balance, and there was further success to the body in the ninth and 10th. After another decent round in the 11th, Quigg tried desperately to close the show but Salinas was on his bike, fiddling his way to the finish. Another British Olympic gold medallist, Luke Campbell, gave a brief but breathtaking exhibition of his talents as he knocked out Neil Hepper with a savage body shot after two minutes. Campbell, who stopped Andy Harris after 88sec in his debut in July, took a little longer in his second paid fight but it was enough to display his hand speed and his power. \"I'm switched on, I train hard and come fight I'm prepared,\" said Campbell, who finished proceedings with a brutal body shot. \"I'm learning as I go but I just want to excite the fans.\" Also on the O2 bill Lee Selby claimed the Lonsdale belt after defending his British and Commonwealth championship with unanimous points victory over Ryan Walsh. Selby was cut under both eyes early but he had the guile to pick through Walsh's defences with his jab and win through by 118-112, 118-110, 117-111 on the judges' cards. Meanwhile Kevin Mitchell's sixth-round dismantling of the Mexican Marco Lopez suggested that a third world title shot, at 28, may not beyond him. Next, though, he wants Commonwealth lightweight champion Derry Mathews - a fight, if made, would be a cracker. Wladimir Klitschko retained his WBA, IBO, IBF and WBO heavyweight titles with a unanimous points victory over the Russian Alexander Povetkin, whom he knocked down four times on the way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
