The new cap may be set at the employee's annual salary, or another lower figure. Vince Cable, the business secretary, thinks the current maximum \u2013 though awarded in only 1% or 2% of cases a year \u2013 deters employers from hiring staff. The current median award is only \u00a35,000 to \u00a36,000, with just 6% of cases leading to awards over \u00a330,000. Cable has resisted pressure to adopt compulsory no-fault dismissal \u2013 a proposal advanced by Adrian Beecroft in a report commissioned by David Cameron and given near totemic status by the Tory right. The business secretary will instead back a voluntary scheme in which employers and staff can sign settlement agreements that would allow an employee to leave a company with a good reference providing they waived their right to pursue unfair dismissal proceedings at a tribunal. The agreements will come into force next summer. Cable's aides were anxious not to sound triumphalist in rejecting the central plank of the Beecroft report, stressing that 80% of his recommendations had been adopted or were now subject to consultation. Tory ministers and the Institute of Directors were also content with the outcome. It was being stressed that many employers had rejected compulsory no-fault dismissal, in part because the arrangement would not have freed them from separate claims of unfair discrimination. Cable will also announce the start of a consultation on how to amend the complex transfer of undertakings regulations, whic h protect employees when a business is transferred from one undertaking to another. Cable said on Thursday: \"We have been looking across the range of employment laws with a view to making it easier for firms to hire staff while protecting basic labour rights. \"Our starting point us that Britain already has very flexible labour markets. That is why well over one million new private sector jobs have been created in the last two years, even when the economy has been flatlining. But we acknowledge that more can be done to help small companies by reducing the burden of employment tribunals which we are reforming and moving to less legalistic dispute resolutions through settlement agreements.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
