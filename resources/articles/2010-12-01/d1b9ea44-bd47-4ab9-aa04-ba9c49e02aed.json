Vincenzo (Ennio Fantastichini) is the owner of a pasta firm, uneasily aware that he must hand over the reins of power to his sons. But Tommaso (Riccardo Scamarcio) would rather be a writer, and is in any case nerving himself up to come out to his father as gay. There is something very sentimental in the comedy, and despite the notional daring of the subject matter, it is a very conservative and complacent film."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
