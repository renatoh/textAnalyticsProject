The Conservatives, who say ministers stole their proposals, accused the prime minister of scoring an own goal. A Treasury document reveals that officials began considering transferable allowances for couples in January - but suggests the chancellor first took an interest the day after the Tories highlighted it this summer. Alistair Darling asked officials to draw up \"final proposals\" in early September and announced the reforms in the pre-budget report the following month, days after shadow chancellor George Osborne pledged to raise the threshold to \u00a31m. David Cameron challenged the prime minister on the issue in the Queen's speech debate on Tuesday, telling him: \"Look me in the eye and tell me that you were planning to reform inheritance tax before our party conference.\" Mr Brown insisted: \"The answer is yes - unequivocally yes...All the records will show it.\" But while the Treasury released details of internal discussions in response to a Freedom of Information request, it refused to publish all the documents on public interest grounds. It argued civil servants could feel inhibited when expressing their views if their advice was made fully available. The document published yesterday says officials were considering the proposal by January 9 and sent a briefing to ministers as pre-budget advice on March 6. Mr Darling was shown the paper on July 27 and confirmed the measure was under discussion for the pre-budget report on August 20, one day after Mr Osborne wrote a newspaper article headlined \"We will scrap death tax on family homes\". The chancellor was given further advice on September 3 and asked officials to \"work up final proposals\" two days later, announcing them in the pre-budget report on October 9, eight days after the Tory announcement. The Conservative pledge was widely credited with restoring the party's fortunes in the polls, forcing Mr Brown to abandon plans for an autumn election. Mr Osborne said the Treasury response represented an own goal by Mr Brown. \"There is not a word on when the final decision on inheritance tax was taken - which suggests they don't want to tell us.\" Philip Hammond, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"The proposal was put up in January and rejected by Gordon Brown. Now we are being asked not to see that as routine advice routinely rejected, but as a proposal they were working up. Frankly that's incredible.\" But an aide to Mr Darling accused the Conservatives of inconsistency, adding: \"They made the charge that before the party conference we weren't considering any of this. Now they say it was because of George Osborne's article in August.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
