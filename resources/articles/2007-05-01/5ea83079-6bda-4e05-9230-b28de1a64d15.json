The contrasting resonances of noisy conflict and palliative endeavour seem highly appropriate to a collaboration between the Fall's Mark E Smith and Domino Records' ambassadors of German electronica Jan St Werner and Andi Toma (aka Mouse on Mars). But the one thing no one could have predicted about Tromatic Reflexxions was just how much fun it would turn out to be. From the barnstorming clunky-house opener 'Fledermaus Can't Get Enough', through the New Order-style northern soul of 'The Rhinohead' and the virtual jug-band blues of 'Chicken Yiamas', to the unexpectedly moving Afro-pop finale of 'Dearest Friends', every track contains something to surprise and delight. Whether Smith is being pursued by a yellow-helmeted singer-songwriter on a mountain bike (in the hilarious 'That Sound Wired'), or burbling 'I am the great MES' like a recently deposed military dictator, he sounds as fully at ease with his past as he is with his present and his future. In the aftermath of John Peel's death, Mark E Smith has found himself installed as de facto spiritual leader - a kind of Salfordian Dalai Llama - of those left bereft by the passing of his most eminent establishment patron. The consequences of this new-found institutional status have sometimes been uncomfortable, as anyone who saw self-confessed Fall convert Frank Skinner and transvestite ceramicist Grayson Perry disingenuously vying for super-fan pre-eminence on a recent edition of The Culture Show will testify (and if you thought that was embarrassing, batten down the hatches for Front Row's coverage of the forthcoming story collection Perverted By Language, wherein a pride of Britain's youngish literary lions get to demonstrate just how much the band has always meant to them by basing short stories on Fall song titles). But Smith's upgraded media profile has happily coincided with the release of the Fall's two best albums in a decade - Fall Heads Roll and Country on the Click. And while the more recent - somewhat disappointing - Reformation Post TLC suggested this umpteenth Indian summer might be at an end, Tromatic Reflexxions gives it a delirious Teutonic techno coda, at the same time as cunningly placing Smith's rumpled eloquence in a context far beyond the ken of those who would seek to co-opt it.
