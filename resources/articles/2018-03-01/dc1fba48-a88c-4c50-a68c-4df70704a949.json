Silva was permitted to return home while City wrapped up the home leg of their round of 16 Champions League tie against Basel last week but is back in the UK and ready to play at Stoke on Monday evening. Following the game they have a fortnight off, part of which they will spend warm-weather training in Abu Dhabi, although Silva will be granted more time in Spain. \u201cThe family is always the most important thing,\u201d Pep Guardiola said. \u201cDavid wants to be with the team but sometimes he needs to go back and see his son and his wife. He knows he has to keep training, too, so he trains alone in Valencia.\u201d Silva was man of the match in his last outing against Chelsea; his form has held up remarkably well whenever he has played in the last couple of months. \u201cDavid is a guy with a lot of technical skills and this league is so complicated because of the physicality and the weather conditions but he survives; he\u2019s been one of the best players in England for a long time now,\u201d the manager added. \u201cAll that time he has played at a high level and we are so happy to have him, and to extend his contract. He\u2019s a huge competitor. He doesn\u2019t speak too much but on the pitch, the moment the game is on, he steps forward. He never hides, even when the going is tough, and that is so important.\u201d One player who may not be returning at Stoke is Benjamin Mendy, who is approaching full fitness and able to take part in training after a knee injury but is to be gradually reintroduced by City\u2019s manager. \u201cThe most important thing after six months out is to be careful,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cBenjamin might think he is strong enough to play like before the injury but that is not going to happen. Even if he believes he is strong he is not strong enough. The knee is going well, so maybe we can start to think about giving him the first 20 minutes in a game. Then it is best to play one game and rest for two because after six months you have to be careful to avoid a muscular injury.\u201d Mendy was still playing for Monaco when City took a mid-season break in Abu Dhabi just over a year ago. The squad flew out between the two legs of their Champions League meeting and although the feelgood factor from a 5-3 victory in the first game was soon extinguished by a 3-1 defeat and away-goals elimination in the return, Guardiola maintains the club owners were supportive in spite of what turned out to be a trophyless season. \u201cThe relationship has always been good, we speak a lot on the telephone,\u201d he said. \u201cThis season, with everything going well and everybody happy, it is easy to support us but what meant a lot to me was that the support was also there last season in the bad moments. They were right behind us and I will never forget that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
