No! No! No!\" roared a smart, middle-aged man squatted in front of the recycling bins on the edge of the grassy slope in front of Wimbledon's big screen. Those crammed on to Murray Mound had endured much already on Friday \u2013 the stampede to secure a small patch of grass, the relentless scorching sun that, at 3pm, was a little less welcome than it had been at 11am, and the long, long wait to see Andy Murray, after Novak Djokovic's earlier semi-final had turned into a knucklebiting five-setter lasting more than four and a half hours. They had even, once Murray at last began to play after 6.20pm, been forced to suffer the impertinent theft of the first set by his opponent Jerzy Janowicz, a Pole of such improbable stature and monstrous serving ability that one tabloid, perhaps inevitably, had christened him \"Lankenstein\". But now that Murray was on a roll \u2013 having claimed the second set, and then, from a break down, the second - the abrupt decision to close the roof and turn on the lights was simply too much to tolerate. Swelling boos rolled down the slope, while one man, wearing a pork pie hat and clutching a half-empty pint glass, leapt to his feet to shout obscenities at the screen, before collapsing in giggles in front of his friends. To be fair, supporting Murray has been no smoother a ride at these championships than at previous Wimbledons, and after driving himself - and the watching thousands - to the very edge of a precipice on Wednesday in his quarter-final encounter with Spain's Fernando Verdasco, nerves were jangling long before the Scotsman took to the court in a bid to win his second successive final place. \"Expectant,\" said Julia St John, when asked to sum up the atmosphere, while admitting to something more like anxiety. She and her sister Philippa Blower, both from Surrey, had managed to find a bench high behind the hill, though one of their places was behind a pillar; they were swapping regularly, she said with a smile, to make it fair. So were they hopeful of Murray's success against the tall Pole? A pause. \"I hope he does it,\" said Blower. \"I really hope so.\" Thanks to a combination of the sun, Juan Mart\u00edn Del Potro's rollicking effort against Djokovic, and the beers, however, by the time Murray walked onto the court, the mound had warmed up nicely, with chants of \"Andy! Andy! Andy!\" before he had hit his first ball in anger. Wimbledon's love for Murray has often seemed, if not ambiguous, then at least muted, but not this time. Despite an understandably twitchy start, by the middle of the third set, when the Scotsman had taken five games in a row, every point Murray won was met with airpunches, every game won with a good proportion of the crowd jumping in the air and, in more than a few cases, dancing. It wasn't just the crowd on the mound that was angered by the roof closure. The club confirmed that it had received a small number of phonecalls and emails during the break complaining about Polish people, \"with particular reference to benefits\". But with the resumption of play, and all the momentum with Murray, the party returned on the slope. The Scotsman's second break to claim the fourth set was met with a huge roar and the crowd leapt as one to its feet. The grins were relieved, however, rather than ecstatic.
