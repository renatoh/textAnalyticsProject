If you lift my tax-free threshold, that changes my life. That means that I get to say to my little girls, \u2018Daddy\u2019s not broke this weekend. We can go to the pictures.\u2019 Rich people don\u2019t even notice their tax-free threshold lift. Why don\u2019t I get it? Why do they get it?\u201d Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, the minister for small business and assistant treasurer, seemed to be reading from the rather discredited theory of trickle-down economics in reply. \u201cThe critical thing here is that we actually need to grow the pie,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to give people an incentive to work, to invest in their businesses and to employ people and create better lives for themselves.\u201d On Twitter Greens senator Janet Rice suggested the opposite to trickle-down economics might be the answer. The question of trickle-down economics was raised directly by another audience member. \u201cThe Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz totally rejected the trickle-down theory of economics where if you take care of the rich the benefits will flow down to all,\u201d Loretta Little said. \u201cWhy has the Coalition designed the budget around the fallacy of Reaganomics and the Laffer curve?\u201d Responding to the question Innes Willox, the chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, brought it back to Storrar, and tried to take a hard line. \u201cDuncan, I\u2019ll be harsh in my message. If you\u2019re on the minimum wage and with a family, you would not pay much tax, if any at all. Would you? You would not pay much tax.\u201d Duncan replied to a loud applause: \u201cI pay tax every time I go to the supermarket. Every time I hop in my car.\u201d But Willox recovered and put forward the case of corporate tax cuts. \u201cWhat, according to the head of Treasury it will do, is drive $160bn into the economy over 10 years. That\u2019s a pretty good return on a $50bn investment. That will create the jobs of the future.\u201d But the sorts of jobs getting created was another issue raised on the program. One audience member said she was disappointed to not hear in the recent budget, anything about a transition from fossil fuels. \u201cA transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy seems to align perfectly with the government\u2019s mantra of jobs and growth but can anyone please explain why there is no plan for this transition in the budget?,\u201d asked Sarah McColl-Gausden. O\u2019Dwyer responded by arguing that Australia\u2019s cuts to greenhouse gas emissions are \u201cvery ambitious\u201d. Australia agreed in Paris to cut emissions by between 26% and 28% below 2005 levels. \u201cPer capita, we are up there with Brazil in actually having the highest emissions reductions in the world,\u201d she said. But relying on per-capita emissions reductions makes Australia\u2019s cuts look quite strong, since we have some of the largest per-capita emissions in the world to start with. Our absolute emissions cuts are set at 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2030. Climate Change Authority chairman Bernie Fraser said that puts Australia \u201cat or near the bottom of the group of countries we generally compare ourselves with\u201d. And others have said it isn\u2019t consistent with keeping warming under 2C. Andrew Leigh, Labor\u2019s shadow assistant treasurer, said: \u201cLabor believes we need more ambitious climate targets in line with what the Climate Change Authority recommends and we should get to zero net emissions by 2050.\u201d O\u2019Dwyer responded: \u201cI think it\u2019s quite irresponsible of Andrew to say that he wants an even higher target because of course the only way that he\u2019ll be able to deliver that is to impose new taxes such as a new carbon tax.\u201d But in the end it was Duncan Storrar\u2019s question that really left people thinking."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
