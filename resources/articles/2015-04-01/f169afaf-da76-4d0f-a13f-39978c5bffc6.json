For their second album, they\u2019ve recalibrated their inherently odd music for a new visionary adventure: this time it\u2019s less muddied by the woodland and more indebted to 1950s exotica \u2013 herein are fabricated, fantastical and wildly colourful imaginings about the future and the universe. A lot of existential questions are asked, but few answers are given, which only adds to the whirring charm of this curious music. From the dusty prog of This Time to funk, krautrock and folk, Stealing Sheep never stick to a singular sound \u2013 but the one constant is a slightly creepy quality; always beautiful but sometimes a little disconcerting. At a time where the word \u201crandom\u201d has been diluted to mean anything from the genuinely surreal to a misplaced spoon, it\u2019s a relief to find something so instinctively strange."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
