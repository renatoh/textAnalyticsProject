In this 90-minute play, Michael Wynne opts for a verbatim approach that offers a mass of data and multiple perspectives. But, while the piece is zealously researched and richly informative, I found myself hankering occasionally for the fictional method of Peter Nichols\u2019s The National Health or the more visibly polemical style of Stella Feehily\u2019s This May Hurt a Bit. The production itself, ingeniously directed by Debbie Hannan, Lucy Morrison and Hamish Pirie, starts as a promenade that takes the audience through the labyrinthine passages of the Royal Court. Beginning in A&amp;E, we move on to meet doctors, nurses, porters and top executives, one of whom succinctly observes that \u201cmost politicians are not really interested in healthcare\u201d. Having addressed the symptoms of the NHS, Wynne then turns to the diagnosis as we take our seats in a simulated hospital ward. The most powerful testimony comes from Julie Bailey who blew the whistle on the failings at Mid Staffs, but we also hear an array of voices. A professor tells us that the NHS was effectively abolished in 2012 with the passage of the Health and Social Care Act. An ex-NHS chief executive sombrely informs us we are in for a period of \u201cmanaged decline\u201d. I applaud the honesty of Wynne\u2019s reporting, his ability to harness so much fact and the quality of the performances: Eileen O\u2019Brien as a senior nurse lamenting the loss of community, Elizabeth Berrington as the implacably truth-telling Julie Bailey, and Robert Bathurst and Martina Laird all stand out. The play also offers much sage counsel including a cardiologist\u2019s observation that \u201cfood can be the most powerful form of medicine, but the slowest form of poison\u201d. But, useful as the verbatim format is, the subject of the NHS is so emotive that I was left wanting to know Wynne\u2019s own point of view."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
