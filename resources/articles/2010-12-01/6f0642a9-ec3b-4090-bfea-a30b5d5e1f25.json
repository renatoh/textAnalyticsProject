Although it may not be clear why, a bleak marsh or haunted attic are as traditional as mistletoe. Tonight will see John Hurt attempting to send some seasonal shivers down the spine when he appears in an updated version of MR James's most famous ghost story, Oh, Whistle and I'll Come to You, My Lad. The old 1970s TV recordings of his stories are worth downloading if you haven't seen them, although perhaps the most atmospheric way to experience one of his masterly bits of spookery is to go to one of actor Robert Lloyd Parry's superb solo performances as I did in January. Susan Hill's hugely successful homage to James, The Woman in Black (broadcast on BBC Radio 7 last week) is now being remade as a film, although a TV dramatisation aired a few years ago would be hard to outclass. Murder, of course, is also associated with Christmas and on Christmas Day viewers will be treated to a slick new version of Murder on the Orient Express, starring David Suchet as Poirot. If you prefer to read a Christie that might prove an icy antidote to all the tinsel and phoney festivity on TV, then might I suggest The Sittaford Mystery, which is very dark and wintry. Two new foreign language films take the whole seasonal chiller theme one stage further this year with out-and-out Christmas horror. Sint, a Dutch film, has done very well and tells the story of a Father Christmas who makes the Childcatcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang look cuddly, while a Finnish film, Rare Exports, is truly gory. Does anyone have any theories about why we seek to be frightened at this time of year in particular?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
