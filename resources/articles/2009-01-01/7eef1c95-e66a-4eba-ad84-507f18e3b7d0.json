Meyer, who succeeded the sacked Marcelo Loffreda last summer, returned home last month, expressing his desire to fulfil the remaining 30 months on his Leicester contract. However, he spoke to club officials this week to say that he could not tell when he would be in a position to resume his role with the Tigers and it was agreed he would resign. The former Leicester and England hooker Richard Cockerill has led the coaching team in Meyer's absence and he will continue to do so while the Tigers look for another head coach. David Young \u2013 who has taken the Cardiff Blues into the Heineken Cup quarter-finals, as top seeds, and into the EDF Energy Cup semi-finals \u2013 is believed to have been sounded out. Young was on Leicester's short list before Meyer was appointed but his stock is now higher, with the Blues doing so well in cross-border tournaments this season. The former Wales and Lions captain has also coached the Barbarians but the Blues have said they want to keep him. Meyer said he was disappointed that his reign at Leicester had been so short. \"Leicester is a very special rugby club and I accepted the job there because I felt it was equipped to go on to greater success,\" he said. \"This has been a very difficult decision for me to make, in difficult circumstances, but I hope everyone can understand my reasons. \"I enjoyed my time living and working in England. The board, the staff, Martin Corry and the players and the supporters have been fantastic towards me and my family during my time at Leicester and also during the time I have spent back in South Africa.\" Leicester accepted Meyer's resignation with regret. \"Heyneke found himself in a very difficult situation and we full understand the reasons for his decision to remain in South Africa,\" said the club's chairman, Peter Tom. \"He had the club's full support to remain with his family for as long as he felt necessary in such difficult circumstances. \"He is a very honourable man and, after spending time discussing the position with his family, he felt it unfair on both parties to carry on indefinitely and he offered his resignation. While disappointed he is unable to carry on his good work here, we sincerely wish him and his family well for the future. They will always be welcome at Leicester Tigers.\" The Blues have confirmed that they will play their Heineken Cup quarter-final against Toulouse, on 11 April, at the Millennium Stadium. The region hope to attract a crowd of 40,000 instead of the 12,000 they would have been able to squeeze into Cardiff Arms Park. That ground has therefore staged its last European match, as the Blues are moving into a new stadium, with Cardiff City, next season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
