I'm a terrible traveller so I factor in lots of contingency time for my own beta male dithering. My top travel tip is ... if you haven't read Ulysses or Middlemarch then don't try it on holiday. I always bring back ... pebbles, snorkels that don't work, novels abandoned after 10 pages and a pocket full of gravel. When I'm travelling I always miss ... the West Wing, even though I have the box set. My ideal travelling companion is ... my girlfriend Abby. She reminds me to have a sense of humour about airports. I'll never go back to ... a youth hostel in Dublin where I stayed while touring a terrible student play. It served soggy cornflakes and sour milk. I can't get enough of ... the casually brilliant food in seemingly every restaurant in France. Maybe I've just been lucky. I like to travel ... with the minimum effort possible and spend my time in almost absolute idleness. If I want something disconcertingly exotic I'll watch Trisha. My most memorable meal ... was in a restaurant in the French town of Vaison-la-Romaine. It was an eight-course odyssey which included things such as red pepper ice cream. My last trip was to ... the Auvergne region of France, where I stayed in a villa with my mates. It wasn't a lads' thing, though - it was very civilised. My first trip was to ... Skegness. I come from Lincolnshire and the default family holiday was in a caravan there. I still love the place. The best place I've been ... was Formentera in the Balearics. It's serene and has beautiful beaches. \u00b7 Robert Webb plays Jez in the new series of Peep Show on Fridays at 10pm on Channel 4"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
