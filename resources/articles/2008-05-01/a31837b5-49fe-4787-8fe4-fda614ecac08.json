Sponsors Boylesports make New Approach 5-4 favourite to take his revenge on the Aidan O'Brien-trained winner, who is 9-4 to complete the Classic double the stable last achieved with Rock Of Gibraltar in 2002. Ibn Khaldun, a 14-1 shot with Boylesports, may get the chance to put a below-par run at Newmarket behind him. He is Godolphin's sole representative among yesterday's 13 acceptors following a setback to Fast Company. Runner-up to New Approach in last year's Dewhurst Stakes, Fast Company missed the Newmarket Guineas, reportedly because of a low blood count. The latest problem arose after he pulled up stiff following a gallop. \"Fast Company has sustained a soft tissue injury and all plans for the colt are currently on hold,\" said Godolphin's racing manager Simon Crisford yesterday. This is another blow for the Classic hopes of Godolphin, and Ibn Khaldun is not yet a definite runner on Saturday. \"We'll decide in the next couple of days,\" said Crisford. \"Some form lines suggest Ibn Khaldun should be running in the Derby and he could go straight there, or run at The Curragh and Epsom. \"For whatever reason, he didn't show anything like his form in the 2,000 Guineas,\" added Crisford. \"He is too classy and works too well for him to be judged on that performance.\" While Ibn Khaldun has a lot of ground to make up from his 10th position at Newmarket, David Elsworth, the trainer of Stubbs Art, is optimistic his colt can get a lot closer than the four lengths by which he was beaten on the Rowley Mile. \"If I was one of the other two, I certainly wouldn't want him up my backside on Saturday,\" said the trainer of Stubbs Art yesterday. \"My horse is in great form and we go there with a certain amount of optimism. If they go a bit faster than they did at Newmarket, that will suit me.\" Stubbs Art, who was sent off at 100-1 at Newmarket, is still an outsider at 20-1 with Boylesports this week. But Elsworth, who won the 1990 Irish 1,000 Guineas with In The Groove, has persuaded the connections of Stubbs Art to stump up the \u20ac40,000 supplementary fee. Seb Sanders will take the ride again. \"He was a bit fresh first time out this season and pulled too hard, but I have no worries with him provided they go a proper gallop,\" said Elsworth. \"We could even make our own running, but I suppose New Approach will do that.\" Ron Cox's tip of the day Kasumi 3.40 Musselburgh Hughie Morrison, the trainer of Kasumi, has a good record with the handful of runners he sends to Musselburgh, a long journey from his Berkshire yard - they show a level stakes profit of over 27 points in the last 10 years. Kasumi is just 1lb higher in the ratings than when second to Baharah in a Class Two race at Ascot, where she was only headed close home, and will be hard to beat here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
