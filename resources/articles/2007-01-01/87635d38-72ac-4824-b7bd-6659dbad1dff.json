A month earlier, it had become a legal requirement in Britain for adults travelling in coaches to wear seatbelts. But while the new law came into force at the same time as the requirement for children under 12 travelling in cars to sit on special booster seats, those under 14 remained exempt from wearing a belt in coaches, taxis and minibuses. At least three children are among those who were seriously injured in the coach crash. National Express said yesterday that the coach driver would have reminded passengers of their requirement to belt up, and that window stickers and safety cards in each vehicle underlined the message. But a spokeswoman said: \"Ultimately it is the customer's decision whether they wear the seatbelt or not.\" The apparent anomaly over the safety requirement for children reflects lingering ambiguity over safety liability for under-14s. At present car drivers are responsible for ensuring that children in their vehicle are wearing seatbelts. But when the new law was introduced in September, the government held back from making coach drivers carry the same responsibility. A consultation on where this liability should lie is due to take place in the next few months, a Department for Transport spokesman said. He said the government's advice had been that every passenger should wear a seatbelt at all times in coaches, even before the new law. All new coaches have had to be fitted with seatbelts since October 2001. Neoplan, the manufacturer of the double-decker, boasts of a raft of safety features on its website, including an electronically controlled EBS braking system, and an electronic stability programme to \"support the driver in critical situations. If the system recognises a dangerous situation it stabilises the vehicle by efficiently braking individual wheels.\" Experiments have begun to fit coaches with a \"black box\" type journey recorder, but National Express said the vehicle involved was not fitted with the computer technology. The accident has put the spotlight on the coach safety, but, according to the Confederation of Passenger Transport, coaches and buses are the safest form of road transport, with only 17 fatalities for every one billion passenger kilometres travelled, compared with 37 for cars and 1,500 for motorbikes. Coaches are given the equivalent of an MOT every month, a test which is far more detailed than ones faced by most motor vehicles, the CPT said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
