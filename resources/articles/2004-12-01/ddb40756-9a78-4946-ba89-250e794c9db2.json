A clean sweep remains a possibility for Jose Mourinho after last night's win, but they needed a deflected opener and a late error by Edwin van der Sar to beat a determined Fulham. In letting a shot from the substitute Frank Lampard squirm over him, Van der Sar handed Chelsea victory. The goalkeeper was making his first start for more than a month because of an injury to Mark Crossley and the knowledge that he otherwise performed well will be of little consolation to him. The Dutchman had earlier been unfortunate to be beaten by a Damien Duff effort that changed direction off Ian Pearce, but Fulham had bravely fought back to equalise. Even in defeat they can take heart from a display that was far removed from their vapid showing at home to Blackburn on Saturday. To suggest Chelsea were downright lucky would be unfair. They will argue with some justification that the moments of fortune were reward for their domination of possession, greater pressure and willingness to shoot when given the opportunity. But it was hard not to feel sorry for Fulham. They displayed a spirit and organisation that made life difficult for Chelsea. Their midfield harried and tackled relentlessly, with Sylvain Legwinski among those impressing and Brian McBride continually getting back to lend a hand. \"We asked for a reaction and got that,\" their manager Chris Coleman said. \"We were very unlucky we didn't get what we deserved. We played the best team in the country and easily matched them. We are a bit disappointed but that's the kind of performance we were looking for.\" Fulham's ambitions extended beyond containment. Andy Cole failed to take three openings at 0-0 and it would have been easy for Fulham to lose hope after Duff's strike. But they hit the bar through Pape Bouba Diop before McBride turned in a cross by the substitute Elvis Hammond. Chelsea could not be faulted for effort either. They never looked likely to romp to a repeat of their 4-1 win here in the Premiership last month, but had the most skilful individuals in Duff and Arjen Robben. It was plain that Didier Drogba, given his first start after a groin problem, is still feeling his way back and it was left to Lampard to strike the decisive goal. \"We want to go all the way and win it,\" Lampard said of the Carling Cup and Mourinho echoed those sentiments. \"It's an important competition,\" he said. Chelsea had started on the back foot as Fulham began brightly, three times causing them worries. That momentum soon petered out but Mourinho's team, despite enjoying an increasing amount of the ball, found it hard to create chances. Steed Malbranque and McBride were willing workers near the front and only when Robben switched to the right did Chelsea seriously threaten. He forced the first of two decent saves from Van der Sar either side of half-time. Cole had just scraped a post for Fulham when Chelsea went ahead, Duff exchanging passes with Robben to create room for a shot that Van der Sar had covered until it deflected off Pearce. But Fulham fought back and Hammond's first involvement was to provide a cross that McBride tapped in after nipping ahead of Ricardo Carvalho. Extra-time loomed until Scott Parker fed Lampard, who turned and struck a shot that Van der Sar ought to have stopped. \"Maybe he could have done a bit better but it came through big Pearcey's legs,\" Coleman said. \"I thought Edwin played well.\" Not well enough, though, to stop Chelsea from staying on course for an unlikely haul of four trophies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
