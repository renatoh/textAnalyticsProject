The shadow culture secretary, Ivan Lewis, made the changes after an early draft of his speech, which appeared in the London Evening Standard, was seized on by the Tory chair, Lady Warsi. The newspaper said Lewis planned to tell the Blairite Progress group that some voters regarded Labour as a \"party which overspent without delivering sufficient value for money\". The remarks were removed by the time Lewis delivered his speech in Westminster last night. The Tories said the remarks by Lewis highlighted their central critique of Labour: that it ran up a large fiscal deficit and failed to introduce proper reforms of public services. Warsi said: \"Miliband promised that last Thursday would be the start of Labour's fightback but even his own shadow cabinet now recognise that Labour's fightback has stalled.\" There was some irritation in the Labour party last night with Lewis for providing the Tories with an easy hit. Lewis irritated Gordon Brown in 2008 when, as a health minister, he called for \"higher taxes for the highest earners\". Lewis made the changes to his speech because he accepted that the reporting of his remarks could give the impression that he believed the party was spendthrift. He said he was trying to describe the perception of voters in the \"squeezed middle\", a group championed by Ed Miliband. In the final version of his speech, Lewis said Miliband's campaign on behalf of the \"squeezed middle\" was struggling to make an impression. \"We have to face up to the fact that there was little sign of those squeezed middle voters in the south-east, south-west and east of England returning to Labour. On the whole, despite the government's too-fast, too-deep cuts, tax increases and trebling of tuition fees, they stuck with the Tories \u2013 a situation which, if sustained, would mean we will not win the next general election.\" Lewis said Labour needed to accept why it lost the election. \"At the last election, [voters] saw Labour as the party of the north, standing up for the poor, benefit claimants, immigrants and minority groups. A party which talks a lot about rights but not enough about responsibility. It is important we understand the depth of people's feelings and frustrations if we are to have any chance of reconnecting so they start listening to us again.\"Lewis made his speech as the shadow cabinet embarks on a bout of soul-searching in the wake of Labour's poor performance in last week's elections. Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary who helped run David Miliband's leadership campaign, warned that the party's devastating defeat in Scotland showed the dangers of running a \"traditional Labour\" campaign. He also made clear that Labour needed to go further than \"baiting\" the Lib Dems \u2013 one of the central themes of Ed Miliband's pitch to the Labour party last year. In an interview with the Progress website, Alexander also said: \"While people may enjoy baiting Liberals, the urgent task is to beat the Conservatives. \"I think Labour activists should see winning support from Liberals as the hors d'oeuvre not the main course because the mortal threat to the prospects of a Labour government being elected at the next general election is not, with respect, Nick Clegg. It is David Cameron and George Osborne.\" The interventions by Alexander and Lewis follow intense discussions in the shadow cabinet and the parliamentary Labour party after the SNP's historic victory in Scotland and local election results in England, which showed little sign of a breakthrough in the south. Labour did win back Gravesham council in Kent but the party was disappointed that it lost seats in Dartford and made no net gains in Great Yarmouth, Milton Keynes and Portsmouth. Miliband made clear to the shadow cabinet that he shared the concerns voiced by supporters of his brother. He described the fight against the Lib Dems as stage one. The next stage would be to intensify the attack against the Tories, he said. The Labour leader showed his determination to learn the lessons of Labour's defeat by launching a root-and-branch review of the Scottish Labour party. It is being led by Jim Murphy, the shadow defence secretary who co-managed David Miliband's leadership campaign and Sarah Boyack, a Labour member of the Scottish parliament. The leader of the Scottish Labour party, Iain Gray, has said he will resign by the autumn and a new leader will have to be found to take on the charismatic SNP leader, Alex Salmond."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
