Tick: set-piece goal. Cross: one from open play. Exactly 82 seconds in, after Jim Rosenthal has explained that George Graham\u2019s side were 16-1 for the title, Wimbledon\u2019s John Fashanu heads a free-kick past John Lukic. Tick. Arsenal equalise though Brian Marwood\u2019s cross-shot after a Nigel Winterburn throw. Another tick. Soon my notebook resembles a swot\u2019s homework \u2013 tick! tick! tick! \u2013 especially when Arsenal begin honing their signature move: Marwood corner, Steve Bould meerkat-craning his neck for the flick-on and someone bundling it home. Such was its success that when the Gunners left Bould out of their penultimate league game against Wimbledon \u2013 a 2-2 draw \u2013 the Guardian\u2019s David Lacey feared it had cost them the title because they \u201cmissed his ability to head the ball on from the near post, which has led to so many goals this season\u201d. Why am I telling you this? Because a coach-friend \u2013 who has worked for several league clubs \u2013 and I were recently discussing Gary Neville\u2019s comments about the declining emphasis on defending. The coach thought Neville was spot on but highlighted another area where some English clubs had become less John Bull and more stereotypical Johnny Foreigner: time devoted to set pieces. Such loose-knitted observations can be difficult to firm up with facts. In the 70s and 80s, when some sides were playing what was dismissed as caveman football, performance analysis was still in the Jurassic period. There was no Prozone or Gamebreaker to scrutinise every kick and spit. However, according to Opta, the number of set-piece goals in the five big European leagues has fallen \u2013 from 1,642 in 2011-12, to 1,586 in 2012-13, to 1,522 in 2013-14. Perhaps it\u2019s the growing focus on technique at the expense of time devoted to set pieces, or possibly the rise of the little man \u2013 see Barcelona and Arsenal \u2013 which has had knock-on effects for dead-ball success. But, sometimes, there has been a change in philosophy, too. The thinking goes something like this: only 6% of free-kicks from dangerous positions lead to a goal. Corners? More like 3%. So, why bother with something unlikely to bring a reward? There are two problems with such an approach: first, most actions in football don\u2019t lead to goals. Second, over the past three years in the big five European leagues, 31% of goals have been scored from set pieces. 31%! One in three! That is a hefty number. Yet set-plays can sometimes be seen as a bit grubby and vulgar. But it is no surprise that, since 2004\u201105, teams coached by Sam Allardyce are better at scoring from corners than the Premier League average. Allardyce\u2019s teams have scored 56 corner goals in 296 league games \u2013 an average of one nearly every five. The Premier League average is one in seven. In Italy Gianni Vio \u2013 the Little Wizard \u2013 gave up a banking career to become a set-piece expert and had considerable success at Catania and Fiorentina before joining Milan last summer. And then there is Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. They were bobbing along in mid-table when Diego Simeone took over in December 2011 but have since secured La Liga, Europa League, European Super Cup, Copa del Rey successes and reached the Champions League final. There are myriad reasons for their astounding success but Simeone\u2019s shark-eyed attention to dead-ball opportunities, which he absorbed from Argentina\u2019s World Cup-winning coach Carlos Bilardo, is chief among them. So far this season, 12 of their 20 league goals have come that way. And only Real Madrid \u2013 with 85 set-piece goals \u2013 have scored more than Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s 80 in the five big European leagues since Simeone\u2019s appointment. Real\u2019s success is easy to explain. It\u2019s not only Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale but Luka Modric, Toni Kroos and Isco \u2013 and the aerial strength of Sergio Ramos, Pepe, Ronaldo and Rapha\u00ebl Varane. But, as their assistant coach Paul Clement told Sid Lowe, they work hard at the basics, too: the quality of the ball into the box, movement, getting a block or screen on opponents \u2013 and repeatedly drumming home individual responsibility. Simeone\u2019s template is not dissimilar. Last season Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s set pieces were numbered and their manager would hold up his fingers on the touchline to signify which one he wanted taken. But it is his assistant, Germ\u00e1n Burgos, who comes up with new ideas, working on ways that Gabi or Koke can find the many big men in their team. Again, it is about the fundamentals: recognising set pieces are important, repetition, accurate delivery, aggression. And how appropriate was it that Diego God\u00edn\u2019s header from a corner sealed Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s title last season? Incidentally, 42% of Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s league goals have come from set pieces since Simeone\u2019s arrival \u2013 the third highest percentage in Europe, just behind Levante and Granada, with Espanyol fourth. Stoke, meanwhile, are fifth. And the two teams with the lowest percentage of their goals from dead balls since December 2011? Barcelona (18.9%) and Arsenal (18.6%). You wonder what, privately, Bould makes of that. Of course, set-piece success isn\u2019t everything. Goals are goals. But, given the two best teams in Europe last season care so much about getting dead-ball situations right, shouldn\u2019t everyone else too?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
