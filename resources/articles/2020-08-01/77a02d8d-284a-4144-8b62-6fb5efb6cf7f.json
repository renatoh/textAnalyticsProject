In a lengthy statement released on Friday, the former first lady condemned the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Wisconsin man shot seven times in the back by police in front of his children, as well as the shooting of three protesters by an alleged 17-year-old rightwing militant in the protests that followed. \u201cI\u2019m just devastated by the shootings in Kenosha,\u201d she wrote. \u201cLike so many of you, I\u2019m exhausted and frustrated right now. It\u2019s a weight that I know Black and Brown people all across the country are shouldering once again. And we\u2019re so often left wondering how things will get better.\u201d Obama had some pointed words for the Trump administration as well, condemning the \u201clack of empathy, division stoked in times of crisis and age-old and systemic racism\u201d that is seen across the country, on the news, and \u201cfrom the White House Rose Garden\u201d. She heralded the protests against police violence and racial inequality that have taken place across the United States in recent months, and encouraged Americans to vote to propel reform. \u201cThese protests and actions will not make Jacob Blake walk again. They will not erase the trauma from those children. And they will not bring back anyone who\u2019s been taken from us. But they will do something. They already are \u2013 opening eyes, rattling consciences and reminding people of all backgrounds that this problem wasn\u2019t solved earlier this summer and it won\u2019t be any time soon unless we all make a change,\u201d she said. Obama\u2019s statement came as tens of thousands of people gathered in Washington DC on Friday for the Get Your Knee Off Our Necks March. Gathered in front of the Lincoln Memorial, demonstrators \u2013 many wearing Black Lives Matter T-shirts \u2013 demanded racial equality and an end to police brutality in the US. Friday also marks the 57th anniversary of the March on Washington, where Martin Luther King Jr gave his I Have a Dream speech urging racial equality."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
