Venables, who was McClaren's No2, continued: \"The Dutch, French, Germans and Italians would not have done it because from their point of view it would be an indictment on them and their coaching courses. If we're not good enough, then that's fine, but they would prefer to have someone who is going to have a simple plan and get the good players going. \"They would rather not win, than [appoint a foreigner]. I'm not saying what's right or wrong. It's within the rules, so why not? That's the way it is. From a professional point of view - and when you talk about the Premier League - it's a world game. There is [now] a slightly different attitude, which has changed [from] my father and grandparents' time because then it would be unheard of. \"That is the era you live in. Now it is different and people don't mind what happens as long as we win, so who is to say it is wrong? As for me, I would have appointed an Englishman.\" Venables, though, believes the Football Association must act for the good of the game in the future. \"All parts, from the FA to those involved in the football itself, have to look at themselves, strip it down and see where the problems are. But it has to be backed. It's no good leaving players to their own devices to get results and say 'It's nothing to do with me'. It's about saying 'Have we all done enough?'.\" Venables has no regrets about being a No2 but it is not a role he wants to pursue again. He may end up as a manager in his own right again soon, with the Republic of Ireland and Bulgaria among those interested. Venables, though, is biding his time. \"I've had quite a lot of interest, which is great, but I'm not in a rush,\" he said. The former Derby manager Billy Davies said he will not consider his next job until the new year. Davies has been linked with the Scottish national team and Fulham. \"I'm thoroughly enjoying my time with the family, giving my kids the conversations I should have had over the last four or five years and spending time with them,\" he said. \"I'm focused on nothing else except enjoying Christmas, getting to the new year, and then we'll see.\" PA"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
