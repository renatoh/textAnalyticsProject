The quality of DAB is woefully short of what I have been enjoying for years on analogue. I bought a Pure DAB radio a year ago, and suffer from 'splashy' sound and occasional descent into silence. I have two Freeview boxes, and radio reception via that means is also unreliable (as is TV on occasions, with sound failure and pixellation of the picture). Analogue TV and radio ain't broke. Why fix them? Robert Caldicott Banbury \u00b7 I've been complaining about the DAB/Eureka 147 standard for more than nine years, so it's heartening to see that World DAB is dumping MP2 and moving to AAC. There are many other issues, such as intellectual property and the creeping privatisation of the airwaves, but one step at a time, right? http://funferal.org/ There's more to science As a mathematical physicist, for the past 40 years I've had an informed view of the lack of understanding of science shown by politicians, economists and business leaders (Why is the government so eager to stifle innovation? November 9). Why they should pretend to be interested in science is amusing: they want to use science to justify policies that will, they hope, keep them in power. Even more striking is that they do not understand how science works. They use \"science\" to cover all branches of knowledge from physics and astronomy to climate forecasting, sociology, economics and, no doubt, astrology. They need at least to make some effort to comprehend the difference between the laws of nature and hand-waving arguments based on extrapolation of time series data. Anthony Dunning Folkestone It's a repeat The single-pixel camera has been around since the invention of TV (One pixel is plenty, November 9). A single light-detector having the incoming image scanned on to it, originally by mechanical means and later electronically. I imagine it would be possible to simulate a TV picture by applying a suitable drive signal to the mirror array in the article. Mike Whittaker Stapleton \u00b7 SPATE (Stress pattern analysis by thermal emissions) uses infrared to find stress pattern distributions in components. It uses a scanning mirror and because infrared light is not very \"bright\" takes a long time to get a stress image. It used a mirror because pixel arrays were so rare and expensive when it was first developed in the 1980s, by the British firm Ometron. Robert Paynter Oxford Stealth weapon It seems to me that Microsoft is still doing what it can to destroy Linux, only this time it's the old \"if you can't beat 'em, buy 'em\" line of thinking. If these companies really want virtual, they should just use VMware. That is where the smart money is, imho. www.muddysmind.com/ Mum's the Word No need for macbore to have his lunch spoilt (Letters and blogs, November 9). When his mum wants to open Word documents without MS Office, he just points her to the free download of Word Viewer, which allows her to view, copy and print Word docs without owning MS Word. She could get the Excel Viewer, the Access Viewer and the Powerpoint Viewer while she's there. Then she can claim she really knows her way round a computer.
