The alleged rape and murder of Maasarwe is one of several brutal attacks on women in Melbourne in recent years, with Eurydice Dixon and Jill Meagher meeting similar fates. It has left women once again asking ourselves: where are we safe? Where do we go from here? It was also a reminder of how news reports can erase Palestinians so easily, with multiple Australian media outlets describing 21-year-old Maasarwe as Israeli or Arab-Israeli, when she was in fact Palestinian. A Palestinian with Israeli citizenship. It does not and should not matter where Maasarwe comes from. No human should suffer what she did. What matters, however, is identifying people correctly, and at the very least honouring that in death. Particularly when Palestinians living under Israel\u2019s government overwhelmingly reject being called Arab Israelis. According to a survey by University of Haifa professor Sammy Smooha, only 16% of Palestinians living in historic Palestine \u2013 now modern-day Israel \u2013 accept the term Arab-Israeli, which is a label prescribed by the government of Israel. The preferred terms include Palestinian citizen of Israel or Palestinian with Israeli citizenship. Arab-Israeli is a vague and politically loaded descriptor, and the very exclusion of the word Palestinian is a political statement which erases Palestinians. Several Australian media outlets showed that by using Israel\u2019s official terminologies, without dissection, they either do not understand or even purposely reject the realities on the ground for Palestinians \u2013 whether in Israel, West Bank, Gaza or the refugee diaspora. Israel\u2019s towering concrete separation wall passes through Maasarwe\u2019s home city of Baqa al-Gharbiyye, dividing it from its sister city in the West Bank, Baqa ash-Sharqiyya. The people who ended up on either side of the separation wall are Palestinian. A barrier and an Israeli passport does not transform a Palestinian into a generic Arab. \u201cFirst, we are all human beings. Then we are Muslim. Then we are Arab. We are Palestinian,\u201d a family member of Maasarwe\u2019s from Baqa al-Gharbiyye told me last week. \u201cThis is our political situation [having Israeli passports], but this is our identity [Palestinian] ... We cannot change the political situation.\u201d And by that same token, they cannot change who they fundamentally are. A friend of the family also told me: \u201cWe have Israeli passports but Palestine is in our hearts.\u201d It is significant to note that Israel\u2019s recently passed nation-state law, which declares it a Jewish nation, excludes Palestinian citizens of Israel and non-Jewish citizens of Israel. The law underscores numerous policies that discriminate against Palestinians because they are not Jewish-Israelis. It is more than a national identity \u2013 it is an ethnic and geographic descriptor. My family is originally from Palestine, long before the state of Israel was created. While we cannot return due to Israel\u2019s absentee property law that stipulates exiled Palestinians cannot reclaim our land back, we are still Palestinian. The decades of statelessness did not nullify my family\u2019s Palestinian identity. It was not cancelled, like some newspaper subscription. If both sides of my family remained in what then became Israel, they would still be Palestinian. So why do people insist this does not exist? Why the historical revisionism? In the week since Maasarwe\u2019s body was found in Melbourne, the Israeli government has reportedly not reached out or made any contact with Maasarwe\u2019s family. Speaking to reporters on Sunday, her sister Noor said only Australian authorities and police were in regular contact with the family. In the week after Maasarwe\u2019s body was found in Melbourne the Israeli embassy in Australia was in contact with the family. But according to Aiia\u2019s sister Noor, nobody from the government in Israel personally reached out to their family until Monday when they received a letter from president Reuven Rivlin. Would this be the case if they were Jewish-Israeli? Noura Mansour, a Palestinian educator with Israeli citizenship living in Melbourne, said the murder of Maasarwe hit close to home. \u201cYou can\u2019t shake the feeling that \u2026 there is no place you can go that is safe for a woman,\u201d Mansour said. \u201cI [also] can\u2019t shake the fact it\u2019s political, everything becomes political \u2013 we can\u2019t even die and have people accept us for who we are. \u201cThe fact is Aiia is Palestinian and also an Israeli citizen. Both of these things are facts. They are not mutually exclusive. That\u2019s just the reality of the complexities back home in Palestine 48, or Israel. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that people insisted on not accepting who she was even though it was pointed out to them multiple times.\u201d Identity aside, Maasarwe was more than her ethnicity or passport. She was a bright young student who could speak Arabic, Hebrew and Mandarin, and a beloved daughter, sister and friend. She was kind and smart and funny. \u201cAn angel, a diamond,\u201d family described her. \u201cA human,\u201d her father said to me. We should honour her memory by giving a full picture of who she was. Jennine Khalik is a Sydney-based journalist.
