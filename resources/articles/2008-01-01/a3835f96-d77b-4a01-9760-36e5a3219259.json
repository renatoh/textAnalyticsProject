Toryboy and I darted round the house unearthing clean and appropriate attire for acts of religious worship and dedication, and tried not to dwell on the fact that we should have left the house 20 minutes before we got up. On the way out, Toryboy slipped on the wet leaves and tangled weedery that litter the garden path (what, you thought a household that can't lay hands on a clean shirt despite six months' notice is set in the middle of an ebullient display of horticultural prowess?) and crashed to the ground. \"I'm hurt!\" he cried. \"Can't stop,\" I said, leaping over the mound of tattered tweed. \"Try to drag yourself back to the house. Love you! Bye!\" He was still there when I rushed back, having forgotten the christening present, but I did my gazelle impression again and hoped for the best. Threw myself on to the train with eight picoseconds to spare and relaxed. But, in my eagerness to grab the last seat, I had forgotten the cardinal rule of commuting: that an empty seat on a crowded train is empty for a reason. I looked, with dread and resignation, to my right. Yes, indeed, I had thrown myself down next to one of those men you know - by the fishy look in his fishy eye, the odd set of the jaw, the overly neatly-parted hair - is not going to engage in effervescent banter. He waited 90 seconds and then handed me a piece of string. \"There you go,\" he said confidingly. \"Now, would you mind tying me up with it?\" This, I concluded while he showed me the best way to fashion a clove hitch, is going to be a long trip. I arrived late to the service, but at least pre-font action (and markedly better versed in basic bondage techniques than when I set out) and by the time it came to my turn to renounce the devil and all his works (which, I had previously clarified, do not include Buffy repeats or blackcurrant Jaffa Cakes), I was a picture of dignified calm. And then I dropped the frigging child in the frigging font. The vicar had mislaid the holy oil, so handed the infant to me, and I fumbled the catch. My memory insists that the baby William bounced round the font like a ball in a roulette wheel, but more detached observers swear that there was a single, if reverberating, thunk. And his superlatively gracious mother was so struck by the horrified look on my face that she all but took a baseball bat to his head to assure me that the 13-month-old skull can withstand far greater assaults than a mere half-foot drop into a marble bowl. Still, all in all, I can't help but feel it is now incumbent upon me, before 'sweet William grows old enough to note the shortcomings of his spiritual sponsor, to get my shit together. Which phrase, incidentally, is a perennially useful US import that I think deserves wider use. Although, on reflection, I probably shouldn't have embarked on my programme of dissemination by teaching it to the kid's three-year-old sister at the champagne reception. Ah well, you live and learn. As long, of course, as you haven't been dropped too severely on the head as a child."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
