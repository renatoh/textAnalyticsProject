He had been cut so much that he could have featured in last week\u2019s budget. He had three small nicks on his forehead, a couple more underneath his right eye, and a large, long gash along his nose, this last bound, now, by a set of butterfly stitches which added a flash of bright white to his rainbow array of bruises, purple, black, and blue. Beneath it all, he was sporting a broad smile. \u201cI know, I\u2019m not getting any better looking,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019ll take that to win a grand slam.\u201d The blow to the nose had come in the second minute of the match so he spent most of the game covered in blood. \u201cBut no one was going to keep me off that field.\u201d Haskell\u2019s partners each had their own wounds. Billly Vunipola\u2019s left eye had turned entirely scarlet, the pupil flushed with blood. \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as it looks,\u201d Vunipola said. He might have been right, because it could not have looked any worse. The two backrows had been in some scrap, and for all the injuries they suffered, it was the Englishmen who won. Vunipola was man of the match, Haskell made more tackles than anybody on either side, and Chris Robshaw was remorselessly excellent. He gave so much of himself that by the end, Eddie Jones said, he could hardly stand. Robshaw and Haskell seemed to be driven men, and played with furious intensity. Two months or so ago, when Jones brought this team together for their first training sessions, the senior players gathered for what they described as \u201ca leadership meeting\u201d. They took turns to talk about what was going to motivate them in the weeks and months ahead. \u201cDylan Hartley and I looked at each other,\u201d Haskell recalled, \u201cand we said it wasn\u2019t just good enough playing for England, we wanted to win something.\u201d Haskell, Robshaw and the rest had long since grown sick of coming second. Two days before the match, it looked as though Haskell would not be able to play. He was suffering with bad back spasms, which started on Thursday morning. \u201cI was in hell,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not going to lie to you there was a moment where I was pretty dark, on Thursday and Friday.\" He spent most of the final 48 hours before kick-off getting medical treatment. \u201cI\u2019ve had so many massages I\u2019ve probably lost a couple of inches in height.\u201d He even took a trip up to London to see a special physiotherapist at 10.30pm. Jones kept popping his head in to say: \u201cMate, we need you, you are playing.\u201d Haskell said back: \u201cAll right, boss.\u201d He probably did not need the encouragement. In the end, he says, his adrenaline carried him through. Haskell is 30, and, well as he is playing, he knows he may not have many caps left in him. \u201cThere are people near the end of their career,\u201d he said, \u201cpeople who\u2019ve been written off.\u201d He seemed to have himself in mind. And it is true he has had plenty of criticism. Sometimes, it has to be said, with good reason. It was not long ago Haskell was swanning around England\u2019s World Cup with a video camera, shooting sponsored footage for his social media accounts. It wasn\u2019t a good look. \u201cWho\u2019s that pillock?\u201d asked one England fan as Haskell walked into Twickenham for their match against Fiji. But Jones has embraced that side of Haskell, and encouraged him to use it to help bind the team on and off the field. It was Haskell who was clapping his hands and bellowing at the backs when England were buckling under the pressure in the second half. And it was Haskell, along with Owen Farrell, who gave the team their orders for the final few minutes of the match, after Hartley was knocked out cold. Before the game, Haskell had asked England\u2019s kitman to print up a couple of T-shirts marked \u201csix-and-a-half\u201d for him and Robshaw to wear after the match. He wanted to make the point, \u201cbecause we\u2019ve both been drilled for not being No7s\u201d. One of those very people who \u201cdrilled\u201d Robshaw was, of course, Jones himself. These days he is full of praise. \u201cDid you see him at the end?\u201d asked Jones. \u201cHe was busted at the end, absolutely busted. The last tackle he made, we kick-chased to the corner, Owen Farrell made the tackle and he was the next bloke in; he could barely pick up his feet. That\u2019s the desire of that guy to be better.\u201d Like their coach, the team holds Robshaw in high esteem. \u201cHe\u2019s been through a lot, undeservedly in my opinion,\u201d said George Ford. \u201cHe is an unbelievable player and an unbelievable bloke and he has battled through a lot of adversity in the last six months,\u201d added Danny Care. Haskell agreed: \u201cRobbo has had a tough time. A lot of people have said nasty things about him when he\u2019s a guy who has always worn his heart on his sleeve.\u201d Robshaw, Haskell and the rest have had plenty of low moments in the England team. They had earned this high, and Haskell was right to relish it. \u201cWe won a grand slam,\u201d he said, \u201cand no one can ever, ever, ever take that away from us.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
