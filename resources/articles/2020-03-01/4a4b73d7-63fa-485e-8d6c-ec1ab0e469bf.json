Tropical weather regularly interrupts trade. Even when they\u2019re hundreds of kilometres away, cyclones wreak havoc on shipping. Isolation and deprivation define our lives. We know better than most how to cope. So imagine our bemusement when we see ranks of empty shelves in Australia, New Zealand, the UK and the USA, denuded by people who pretty clearly have never dealt with a shortage before. And when we read about fisticuffs in suburban grocery stores over toilet paper, of all things\u2026 well, we\u2019d facepalm, but that\u2019s unsanitary. Since 2003, I\u2019ve endured half a dozen or so supply shortages as a result of cyclones and too many near misses to count. In 2015, cyclone Pam devastated our tiny island nation, damaging 90% of all buildings in the capital. Days later, after visiting the devastated island of Tanna, I penned a few lines: My house has blown down And my garden is gone And I don\u2019t know what ship My next meal is on. Take it from someone who\u2019s dealt with disruptions before. You\u2019re facing two challenges: shortages, which probably won\u2019t be terrible; and isolation, which can be. But first, the world won\u2019t run out of toilet paper. Your city won\u2019t run out. Your neighbourhood store wouldn\u2019t either, if you\u2019d just leave some on the shelves. The same goes for canned foods. Fortunately for everyone, the electricity and water supplies aren\u2019t at risk from coronavirus, so refrigeration, communication, and light aren\u2019t a problem. Count your blessings. A friend wisely observed once that the only real luxuries in life are hot water on a cold day, and cold water on a hot one. If you have the cash to spare, there\u2019s no harm laying in a few weeks\u2019 worth of staples. No need to overdo it, experts and officials say enough food to tide you over for two weeks if you\u2019re forced to self-isolate should do it in most places. If you do choose to lay in supplies, don\u2019t forget the small stuff. Sartre said \u201cHell is other people\u201d. I say it\u2019s two weeks of rice without sauce. Back in 2004, cyclone Ivy stranded me on the island of Ambae. It took weeks to restore contact with the outside world. Within days, we were scouring the dregs of my host\u2019s spice rack in order to make our daily plate of rice more palatable. That was an adventure that quickly stopped being fun. Don\u2019t get caught unprepared. Keep a supply of your favourite sauces and dry seasonings, the ones you love so much you\u2019re willing to end up hating them. Because you will. Other advice if you are stockpiling: buy things you know how to cook, nothing else. This is no time to experiment. Any tasty snacks you buy will be gone in 48 hours. Though I do recommend keeping a secret chocolate stash, so you can savour that. And think about others. The people who most need to stockpile are the least able. If you ask me, isolation is harder to cope with than any shortage. If we see widespread home-quarantining, and people forced to self-isolate for weeks to manage the spread of the virus, most of us are going to be distanced or alone for the first time in our lives. Kindness is going to matter more than ever. If you do end up quarantined, your greatest enemy will be boredom. I remember being trapped by a cyclone in a single room with three brilliant friends. We started out in high-minded discourse solving all the world\u2019s problems, but twenty hours later we were reduced to debating whether Boutros Boutros Ghali or Kofi Annan was hotter. (Kofi, of course. Like it was even close.) Things get silly \u2013 or serious \u2013 fast. You can either roll with it, or it will roll on you. Lighten up and you\u2019ll make it through. And be kind, even when you don\u2019t feel kind. We\u2019re all alone in this together.
