Harris didn't start presenting the television show until its second series, so it was left to musicians such as Alice Cooper to reminisce about the earliest days. He knew how the series got its name \u2013 from the idea that if doormen and delivery people could whistle a tune, it would be a hit \u2013 and spoke about learning quickly how to survive in the industry. \"Trying to be your stage persona is almost impossible,\" he said of those who hell-raised off-stage too and died young. Producer Michael Appleton recalled an alternative possible name (\"Florence Foster Jenkins' Musical Emporium\") and the musical moment \u2013 James Taylor's Sweet Baby James \u2013 that shaped the show. \"That's the collar I want to put around my neck and be led down the road with,\" he remembered. Yusuf Islam discussed ageing with Harris. \"We just don't know how long we've got, so you want to do important things,\" he said. It was a rare deflating moment in the programme: turned out he was talking about writing a musical."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
