It stays ahead of the curve when it comes to the latest brands and was first to introduce London to the covetable coats of Sandy Liang, By Far footwear and Salt Surf. With a clientele evenly split between male and female, genderless labels are popular \u2013 including its own line of T-shirts. Owner Nazifa Movsoumova says: \u201cWe are in a prime location, near Shoreditch House and Jasper Conran\u2019s Boundary hotel, so we see a lot of tourists at the weekend. Weekdays are when our regulars return to the caf\u00e9 and to check out the new drops. We\u2019ve also just launched crystals, so if you\u2019re looking for some guidance or a good omen, we\u2019ve got an amazing array!\u201d themodernsociety.com; @modern_society_london Browns Fashion, Mayfair Established in 1970 as one of the first multi-brand boutiques in the UK, Brown\u2019s has a reputation as a fashion talent scout that is second to none. Founder Joan Burstein employed Manolo Blahnik and Osman Yousefzada, and discovered Alexander McQueen and John Galliano. Now owned by online giant Farfetch, the original South Molton Street store has powerful backing and a big digital engine, as well as a second store, Browns East. Cutting edge and bang on trend are its milieu. Current faves are the labels Ruslan Baginskiy and Wandler. Look out for spangly disco swimwear from French label Os\u00e9ree and Leslie Amon and micro sunglasses from Roberi &amp; Fraud. brownsfashion.com MatchesFashion, Marylebone It may have an online behemoth behind it (having been sold for a reported \u00a3400m), but the MatchesFashion Marylebone boutique is still both a local and destination store for the stylish shopper. As much drop-in fashion clinic as shop, customers can enjoy a calendar of events throughout the year. This year\u2019s summer celebrations start this month when guests can mingle with the designers behind womenswear vacation brands, Horror Vacui, \u00c1lvaro, Gioia and Wiggy Kit and shop the looks. Recommended for the shopper \u2013 both male and female \u2013 who wants to be first in line for the most stylish new brands. matchesfashion.com; @matchesfashion KJ\u2019s Laundry, Marylebone In pretty Marylebone Lane, this 12-year-old New York-feel store owned by Kate Allden and Jane Ellis offers designer labels on the cooler side of feminine bohemia. \u201cOur customers are confident working women who come to us for the special pieces in their wardrobe that they can\u2019t find on the high street,\u201d says Ellis. Look out for pretty printed shirts by Paris brand Soeur, minimalist frills from Ulla Johnson and this season\u2019s new-to-the-store labels Birds of Paradis and Natalie Martin. kjslaundry.com; @kjs_laundry The Place, Mayfair Veteran retailer Simon Burstein, son of the founders of Browns Fashion, has just opened a new multi-brand store next to Claridge\u2019s. As you\u2019d expect from Bernstein\u2019s pedigree, there\u2019s a prestigious mix of new and interesting designer labels, particularly embroidered designs by Alice Archer (formerly of Dries Van Noten), Sofie D\u2019Hoore\u2019s chic European minimalism and Dodo Bar Or\u2019s colourful boho cotton dresses. For menswear, bright and jolly shirts from Leathersmith of London work well alongside. Simon says: \u201cWe\u2019ve been established on Connaught Street with a men\u2019s and women\u2019s store for some time, but last month we had the opportunity to open up on Brook Street, opposite Claridges, which is a great location, although I\u2019m only too aware that there\u2019s a lot of competition out there. We put a lot of emphasis on service, and atmosphere and the assortment of brands are relatively unknown to people. Whether it\u2019s a young brand or a well-established label that hasn\u2019t been that visible \u2013 like Sophie D\u2019Hoore, the Belgian designer, who is great for a certain kind of woman. The customer loves what she does. The most important brand for me is Alice Archer, the designer I\u2019ve been backing since the days of Browns, where I was CEO. It\u2019s luxurious, it\u2019s special and it really comes with something very different.\u201d theplacelondon.co.uk; @the.place.london 18montrose, King\u2019s Cross With branches in Glasgow and Nottingham, as well as London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross, this casual and streetwear boutique dresses men (and some women) across the nation. Best-selling brands include casual\u2019s favourite Stone Island, alongside footwear by Adidas and Nike \u2013 this season\u2019s Raf Simon\u2019s Replicant trainer is flying out. Look out for new-to-the-fold designer Heron Preston, with his millennial take on jersey trackies, hoodies and graphic T-shirts. 18montrose.com; @18montrose Couverture &amp; The Garbstore, Notting Hill These two stores make for one bright retail experience. On the ground floor and mezzanine it\u2019s the Couverture take on womenswear, home and lifestyle. Downstairs is Garbstore\u2019s menswear. Both have beautiful, unusual buys that will stand out, even if the price points can be a stretch. Favourite labels for women include New York\u2019s Rachel Comey and London\u2019s LF Markey. Men should make a beeline for watches by Techne and the English Difference, the Garbstore\u2019s latest own line. couvertureandthegarbstore.com Wavey Garms, Peckham Set up by former chef Andres Branco as a Facebook page to trade hard-to-find 80s and 90s streetwear to a millennial audience whose parents probably had the originals, Wavey Garms (Urban Dictionary translation: cool clothes) has been described as \u201cchanging the face of British fashion\u201d. Its success has led to collaborations with global players such as Nike, as well as diversification into styling, creative direction and its very own coffee-table book. If you want to buy the garms in person, you can now do so at its recently opened store in Peckham, south London. waveygarms.com; @waveygarms Dukes Cupboard, Soho Dreaming of 90s Stussy? Dukes Cupboard is the vintage designer and sportswear store for you. Having started back in 2012 as a market stall for secondhand Polo by Ralph Lauren on Soho\u2019s Brewer Street, success has led it into the warmth of a physical store around the corner at Green\u2019s Court. Lacoste, Polo, Nike, Stone Island and Dolce &amp; Gabbana all feature large and if you can\u2019t get there, they have a strong online website and Instagram presence with 28.2k followers. dukescupboard.com; @dukescupboard Other/shop, Soho Looking for a fashion-forward take on unisex and workwear? Other/shop could be the store for you. A selection of considered labels including the excellent Studio Nicholson (mens and womens), Story MFG, London-based fashion favourite Peter Jensen and the street-influenced Aries Arise provide an interesting blend, alongside the store\u2019s own brand Other, an androgynous collection of utility fashion, designed by the founders and produced and fabric-sourced in the UK. other-shop.com; @othershop london Our Daily Edit, Brighton Former TV producers Ella Wells and Marc Lewis are the husband and wife team behind this relaxed and friendly store. Mingling fashion with lifestyle and art, bestsellers for women include the ever popular Ganni, LF Markey and Sideline, who are based nearby in Lewes. Male customers come back for Portuguese Flannel, Levi\u2019s Made &amp; Crafted and Wood Wood. Ella says: \u201cMarc and I always wanted to be a store that felt welcoming and inspiring with no obligation to buy. We try to take on brands that people haven\u2019t heard about. We do have some bigger labels, but we like niche labels. We like to support local designers and artists. We work with them on collaborations and hope to find a new audience through them.\u201d ourdailyedit.com; @ourdailyedit Object Style, Manchester A Scandi-style boutique in Manchester\u2019s trendy Chorlton? What took them so long? Object Style is the whole shebang \u2013 a finely curated collection of clothes for men and women and mid-century homewear, put together by husband and wife team Alex and Rachael Otterwell. Womenswear has a utility feel in muted palettes (modelled online by chic owner Rachael) and accessorised with minimalist plated jewellery. Menswear comprises chunky leather footwear and shaggy knitwear. Buy a scented candle for the complete hygge experience. objectstyle.co.uk; @object_style Hervia Bazaar, Manchester This designer luxury store does a good line in cutting-edge labels, such as Thom Browne, Rick Owens and Gosha Rubchinskiy. Streetwear style brands, such as Comme des Gar\u00e7ons line Play, as well as Kanye West\u2019s Yeezy and sneaker brand collaborations are also a favourite, while Hervia\u2019s retail partnership with Y-3 also allows it the largest online selection of the Adidas brand in Britain. hervia.com; @herviaofficial Cricket, Liverpool Compared to the height of Coleen Rooney fever, Cricket enjoys less national media attention than it once did, but no less commercial success. In designer-conscious Liverpool, where teenagers will fork out \u00a3500 for a pair of prom shoes, the fashion stakes are high and owner Justine Mills (good pals with Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful, don\u2019t you know) always provides. It was the first UK buyer of Balenciaga, which can\u2019t currently be kept in store long enough, alongside catwalk looks from Celine, Valentino, Chlo\u00e9, Versace and contemporary brands, such as Off-White. Menswear also performs well and the kidswear downstairs allows a frenzy of mini-me styling on the shop floor. cricket-fashion.com; @cricketfashion Resident Store, Frome, Somerset A lifestyle boutique with clothes, rather than a fashion store, Resident brings together a carefully considered blend of garments that work well in the Scandi-inspired interiors that are so all-of-us right now. Look out for the soothing colour palettes of Selected Femme and Selected Homme, easy shirting by Form &amp; Thread and minimalist weatherproof coats by Rains. residentstore.co.uk; @resident_store Square, Bath A Bath stalwart for more than three decades, Square has recently rehoused itself in a building where Mary Shelley wrote part of Frankenstein. The style continues at this classic boutique with bright mid-priced dresses by Rixo in the window and drawing in the crowds. Also currently selling well are Golden Goose trainers, the Isabel Marant diffusion line Etoile, sensuous silky pieces by Italian label Forte Forte and knitwear staples by 360 Cashmere. A new website will be coming next season. @square_bath Found, Bath There\u2019s an eclectic mix of apparel, accessories, jewellery and stationery at Found, a store that seeks out the lesser seen. A strong emphasis on British brands sees contemporary womenswear label Sideline (good jumpsuits), sitting alongside the always excellent YMC and colourful knitwear by Hades. For men, this season Hong Kong label Made by Scrub joins the likes of Universal Works and Penfield. Fashion types will hone in on the cool earrings by Machete, too. foundbath.co.uk; @foundbath Black White Denim, Wilmslow, Cheshire Catering for a swish Cheshire crowd, Black White Denim provides a trendy and bright take on daywear and looks to dress up for evening. Favourite labels include dresses by Rixo, trainers from Air &amp; Grace, shirting by Rails and Bella Freud, and John Smedley knitwear. The ingeniously entitled menswear department, Bloke White Denim, is a recent addition and carries many of the same brands as womenswear. Owner Jo Davies says: \u201cThere\u2019s so much anonymity now in online shopping that I think our customers really like the whole relationship element of the purchase in our store. My shop has become a bit of an extension of my home. It\u2019s a bit like having the front door open, the kettle and a load of clothes people want to try on.\u201d blackwhitedenim.com; @blackwhitedenim Old Town, Holt, Norfolk A unique offering, Old Town calls itself a micro-clothing company and produces and sells early-20th-century-inspired workwear in a contemporary style from its shop and workshop in Holt. Think high-waisted moleskin men\u2019s trousers (\u00a3150) and apron dresses for women (\u00a388). They make about 70 garments a week, using British cotton, wool and linen where possible. Without marketing, Old Town has developed a cult following, particularly among creatives who see the look as an alternative uniform. old-town.co.uk; @oldtownengland Bernard Boutique, Esher, Surrey This family-owned store may have been around for yonks, but it consistently delivers a fresh take on the season\u2019s best fashion for women. For this season, bright printed pieces and swimsuits from Ganni, the Danish label much loved by the fashion crowd, stand out, as well as pointy glamorous mules by the British Malone Souliers. They\u2019re one of the few stockists of the ultra-cool Japanese label Sacai and also stock No 21, Chlo\u00e9 and Moncler for its well-heeled locals. Always worth a visit. bernardboutique.com; @bernardboutique The Hambledon, Winchester A Georgian-fronted building, with rooms that date back to Tudor and Norman times, this buzzy, creative destination store houses three rooms of womenswear, menswear in the basement, and homewares, stationery and whatever else they fancy. Popular labels for women include Bellerose, Stine Goya, coats by Shrimps and summerwear by Masscob. Menswear favourites include the harder to find 6876 and Adsum. People travel far and wide for the Hambledon experience. But even if you can\u2019t get there, the relaunched website now also offers its extensive range of fashion. thehambledon.com; @thehambledon The Dressing Room, St Albans, Hertfordshire \u201cA point of difference, that\u2019s what people want when they shop at independents,\u201d says Deryane Tadd, who opened her award-winning womenswear boutique 13 years ago. Stocking around 90 brands, including the currently popular ethical trainer brand Veja, she offers exclusives with midpriced Brit brands, such as Lily and Lionel, Pyrus and Mercy Delta, as well as a styling service that can be done online or in store. Their YouTube styling videos are also worth checking out for those who can\u2019t get to Herts. the-dressingroom.com; @thedrstalbans Tribeca, Brighton Laura Starbuck has been offering the style-savvy Brighton woman \u2013 from 30 to 80-somethings \u2013 just what she wants for 15 years from her chic and understated store. One of the first to bring Isabel Marant to Britain, she still sells the now mega French brand, along with Acne, jeans by Agolde and cool leather bags by Marant\u2019s husband, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Dreyfuss. Look out for the quintessentially Parisian label Polder arriving in the next few months. tribeca-brighton.co.uk; @tribecabrighton Envoy of Belfast, Belfast A worthy past winner of Ireland\u2019s best boutique, this understated store has quite simply one of the most tasteful buys in these isles. It\u2019s almost impossible to find pieces by Paul Harnden but Envoy has them, alongside a great edit of Dries Van Noten and the Japanese brand Engineered Garments, and knitwear from Ireland and Scotland by &amp; Daughter. Trickers shoes and New Balance trainers complete the look. Owner Ruth Spence says: \u201cWe\u2019ve been open for 10 years and I think we do well because we sell a lot of harder-to-find brands. People are looking for garments with longevity, and because we\u2019ve worked with clients for years we\u2019re able to say: \u2018Oh, this would work with the piece that\u2019s already in your wardrobe!\u2019\u201d envoyofbelfast.com; @envoyofbelfast Flannels, Cardiff A luxury fashion offering for men, women and kids, the Cardiff branch of Flannels boasts labels such as Gucci, Valentino, Christian Louboutin, Jimmy Choo, Giuseppe Zanotti, Lanvin and Moncler. New for this season is Off-White menswear, from Virgil Abloh, the designer recently scooped up by Louis Vuitton. With a personal shopping service and a custom-made offering on certain lines, this is an upscale retail experience. Flannels also has 18 stores in the UK and opens another in Westfield London in July. flannels.com; @flannelswoman; @flannelsman Jules B Jesmond, Newcastle One of the northeast\u2019s fashion gems for the last 30-plus years, Jules B stocks mid-priced and designer labels on the glam side, including denim by Victoria Victoria Beckham and cult sunglasses by Le Specs, with new additions from Gigi x Tommy Hilfiger. Menswear includes Barbour International, Paul Smith and Hartford basics. Two more stores are also in Yarm and Kendal. julesb.co.uk; @julesb_online Morgan Clare, Harrogate Twenty years as one of Yorkshire\u2019s premium designer stores is no mean feat. The newly upgraded store is all dark wood floors and crisp white walls, with an evolving blend of brands \u2013 most recently Ancient Greek Sandals, Preen Line and Robert Rodriguez, joining dressing-up favourites Stella McCartney and Peter Pilotto and denim from Paige and J Brand. Weekly buyers\u2019 picks and product updates feature on its lively Instagram feed. There\u2019s also a branch of the store at 36 The Grove, Ilkley. morganclare.co.uk; @morgan.clare Cruise, Glasgow From APC and Balmain to Vivienne Westwood and Y-3, by way of Gucci and Hugo Boss, Cruise is an encyclopedia of contemporary fashion. There are now 10 stores in the chain (including outside Scotland in Newcastle, Belfast and Derby), but the original venture started in Glasgow, where there is now both a premium and mainline store. For polished, big-bucks designer labels, it\u2019s hard to beat. cruisefashion.co.uk; @cruise_fashion Jane Davidson, Edinburgh First opened in 1969, this Edinburgh institution is now run by Jane Davidson\u2019s daughter, Sarah. It\u2019s a wonderful place to shop when you want to dress up for a special event, with a beautiful selection from Dries Van Noten, Osman and Roland Mouret. Bella Freud knitwear and denim by J Brand, Donna Ida and Rag &amp; Bone keep day wear fresh. New labels include special pieces by Alice Archer and occasionwear from Rick Rhi. janedavidson.co.uk; @janedavidson52 Pam Jenkins, Edinburgh This emporium is often referred to as Scotland\u2019s premier accessories store but really, is there anywhere else in Britain that does it as well as this pretty shop? All the glossy names are here \u2013 Jimmy Choo, Christian Louboutin, Rupert Sanderson and Gianvito Rossi, alongside shoes and silk scarves. Always worth checking out what they have on their online sale, too. pamjenkins.co.uk; @pamjenkinsshoes"}, "isHosted": false}}}
