The Guardian, and Will Self, who says he drew extensively on the book, apologise for the omission. \u2022\u2008A piece profiled a former BBC presenter, Susan Osman, who has moved to Beijing to host a breakfast programme on China Radio International (Good morning, Beijing, 3 March, page 12, G2). It reported her as saying that her show was pushing boundaries in small but meaningful ways and giving the example that on the day a British man, Akmal Shaikh, was executed in China for drug trafficking despite assertions that he was mentally ill, the programme had discussed mental disorders. In fact she was referring to China Radio International in general at that point, not to her own show. That discussion took place on a different programme, a few weeks before Susan Osman's show began. \u2022\u2008An item about Michael Foot's literary achievements described his book about Jonathan Swift, The Pen and the Sword, as a biography. It is not so much a biography as a study of Swift's role in the downfall of the Duke of Marlborough, concentrating on the two years of 1710-11 (The week in books, 6 March, page 5, Review)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
