Expertly prepared assiette de crudit\u00e9s, risotto fruits de mer, pork casserole with olives and onion soup are the sort of dishes that transport regulars back to their holidays in France, along with the low prices - \u00a36.90 for lunch, \u00a317.90 for a slap-up dinner. Franc's, 14 Cuppin Street, Chester (01244 317 952) Set over three floors of a townhouse stuffed full of mirrors, posters, suspended bicycles et al, Franc's is brimful of atmosphere. But its main attraction are the seasonal menus, so French that they practically croak: goujons, steak au poivre and bouillabaisse are all here. The three-course prix fixe costs \u00a313.85 and a pre-theatre menu \u00a37.95. La Cuisine d'Odile, 13 Randolph Crescent, Edinburgh (0131 225 5685) Odile Petre has been cooking lunch in the Institut Fran\u00e7ais for 15 years now and still produces the most sophisticated 'home cooking' in Edinburgh, despite a price tag of \u00a37.35 and a BYO policy. Starters include stuffed peppers or artichoke and mint tart, followed by braised duck leg with shallots and red wine. It's worth popping in for her 'choc-Odile' (rich chocolate tart) alone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
