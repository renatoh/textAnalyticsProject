Instead, we pushed back", "bodyText": "Everyone from NME to the Sydney Morning Herald agreed: Tame Impala\u2019s Let It Happen was the tune of the year. A \u201cmesmerising song\u201d according to the Herald, \u201cthat could introduce an explanation of 2015.\u201d The music was sprawling and psychedelic, with a very danceable beat while the lyrics were almost yogic, extolling the virtues of yielding to the flow of life. For months, I played it over and over \u2013 as if the song had a meaning and a message that was peculiar to the times, a portent of sorts. The falcon had long ago stopped hearing the falconer and I wondered if in this song there contained a message: was this how to live? You just go with the flow? You can go with the flow or you can push against it. But now, all around, there seemed to be an uneasy apprehension that we were in a flow we should not go with. This was the year of pushing back against the currents; against things that felt wrong, evil or cruel. We rose up time and time again this year. We pushed back: against Adam Goodes being booed at the football, against the execution of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran in Indonesia, against the shrinking resources allocated to women\u2019s refuges, against attacks on the ABC and Q&amp;A, against the treatment by the Abbott government of Gillian Triggs, and then \u2013 later \u2013 against Abbott himself. It wasn\u2019t just here in Australia, either. In January, after the Charlie Hebdo attacks, there were 3.7 million people on the streets of Paris, world leaders linking arms, marching in a way that suggested the formation of a new army \u2013 a people\u2019s counter-insurgency. What started in Ferguson, USA, last year continued into 2015, civil rights activists pushing back against police shootings, while race politics coalesced and fizzed for a time around the curious case of Rachel Dolezal, the white woman who wanted to be black. As the year unfolded, a million refugees pushed a path through Europe, to destinations unknown. But by the time November came around, by the time of the Bataclan slaughter in Paris, we were spent and heartbroken. No one marched, they just built shrines. 2014 was a year when the news just rolled in (let it happen, let it happen) and what could we do with the pace of everything except be dumb spectators, bearing witness to a horror show of chaos and disorder? The disappearance of MH370, Joe Hockey\u2019s cruel budget, the Ebola plague, the shooting down of MH17, fighting in the Ukraine, more than 2,000 killed in Gaza, the Lindt caf\u00e9 siege. How could we not expect that something toxic about 2014 would seep into the next year? Yet the push back of 2015 was less a sustained, contained fight from which political and social movements were born and was instead a series of skirmishes. They were scrappy, fueled by anger and heat, febrile and moving quickly, yet shifting little. Through our avatars on social media we surged white-hot to the centre of whatever was happening (Adam Goodes, George Pell, Scott Morrison, Sam Frost). And then when that thing passed, we rushed to the next and did not look back. I saw it close up as co-founder of the Mercy Campaign started in 2012 to fight for clemency for two Australians on death row, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. There were the years of trying to get attention, the incremental accumulation of likes on Facebook, the infrequent media inquiries and running as the last item on SBS news before they went to sport or weather. Then in late 2014 and 2015 both men received rejections of their clemency appeals and the story was in the hot zone. And on it rolled: 58 days in that particular news cycle (it wasn\u2019t Tame Impala, it was The Presets Ghosts that ran in my inner ear from January to May: \u201cOnce I was a very young man, and very young men are none to clever/ sailed across to faraway lands/ and faraway towns of tin and terror\u201d) until it reached its irrevocable conclusion on 28 April. Mercy\u2019s campaign servers had crashed from the weight of web traffic, those managing the social media could, after a time, only observe the tide of messages and comments on our Facebook with a sort of awe. YouTube was filled with tribute songs people had made for the guys. Politicians of both stripes \u2013 some with tears in their eyes \u2013 spoke in parliament and gathered at dawn for a cold Canberra vigil. Muftis made mercy dashes and TV crews decamped to Jakarta and Central Java. Then it was over. Autumn turned into winter and the soil was tilled. No one was talking about executions anymore. It was like it never happened. We move onto the next skirmish and the next outrage, as hungry and rangy as wolves. The process of engagement and dissent now resembles the death of a star: \u201cThere is no more fuel to burn and make it shine. Soon its massive dense core is bound to collapse under its own weight.\u201d What else could we do? This year we had to push back. It was such a cruel year. It was the year Iranian Kurdish asylum seeker Fazel Chegeni \u2013 wretched, gone mad, incarcerated for an indefinite term \u2013 died on Christmas Island after an escape attempt. It was the year eight men were led to the killing fields of Nusa Kembangan, bound, a cross drawn on their chests to mark the spot, and shot. It was the year Isis released a video of Jordanian hostage Muath al-Kasasbeh being burned to death while locked in a cage. It was the storming of the central library at Mosul and the destruction of 100,000 books, manuscripts, and newspapers. It was the beheading of the 81-year-old Syrian archaeologist who hid information from Isis about the location of hidden treasures in Palmyra. All this \u2013 how can we just let it happen? Pushing back is a good thing, particularly when the world\u2019s gone bad. But pushback without real feeling and commitment behind it is just outrage. Here\u2019s the flare of the fuel burning up before it dies, there\u2019s the heat and the fury \u2013 bright and warm but only for an instant. In Tame Impala\u2019s song, there\u2019s a verse that resonated. It\u2019s about a Bedouin wind whipping around, carrying away everything that wasn\u2019t bound. Maybe 2016 will be the year of engagement, where we become bound. Our shattered attention spans could be healed and recalibrated over summer and then we could make a New Year resolution to stay with something \u2013 one thing \u2013 and we could work on that. Why don\u2019t we try to seek something more, something deeper and more profound than mere outrage? Let\u2019s stay with an issue, after the fire has passed through it, and work for real change."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
