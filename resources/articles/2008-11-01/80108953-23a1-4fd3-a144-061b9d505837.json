His Sixties hits were revolutionary, operatic arias borne up by his doomstruck tenor, a dramatic departure from the rockabilly fodder he gave Sun Records in the Fifties. This beautifully packaged 107-song set follows Orbison's career from his earliest demos to the unlikely triumphs of his Eighties comeback. The late hits have dated worse than the early ones, but Orbison's commitment and dignity remain constant."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
