This was meant to be the year in which founder Brent Hoberman defied his doubters and proved there was a real business hiding within the huge goodwill write-offs. Oodles of cash would flow, and Lastminute would reclaim its status as top dotcom darling. Alternatively, if the company failed to meet its targets, the brigade of short-sellers would enjoy bumper profits and bragging rights. Lastminute, they would say, was only ever a hangover from the bubble. In fact it looks as if the drama will be denied a natural ending. The company announced a bid approach yesterday, and the mood music suggests it is of the serious kind. That is already a disaster for the short-sellers, who were obliged to cover their positions, helping to send the shares up 45%. Mr Hoberman, who tends to think the stock market is a conspiracy of price manipulators, will have enjoyed their pain. But is he really prepared to sell his creation? In many ways, selling now is perverse if he really believes Lastminute is woefully under-appreciated. If around 100p, the recent level, is the wrong price, surely so is 150p, the region where a bidder might start. After all, the shares were 200p a year ago, and 300p six months before then. It's not as if Lastminute's market itself has changed fundamentally: a quarter of travel is now booked on the internet. The directors will, naturally, consider their duties to all shareholders, but it's still a process governed by individuals. So here is exhibit number one, an interview Mr Hoberman gave to London's Evening Standard a few weeks ago: He complained of how the media builds you up to knock you down, that \"running a business is harder than everybody thinks\" and that \"my wife met me when I was fun\". Sounds like a man ready to cash in his chips. Muddy pitch A few years ago, the events at sports chain John David would have created a kerfuffle about shareholder rights. The private sale of shares by two directors to an existing big investor was the sort that would raise eyebrows, particularly if it forced a mandatory bid below the market price about which the executive chairman knew nothing. At John David, though, everybody seems relaxed - especially Schroders, with its 20% stake. You could perhaps call it the Philip Green effect. These days, investors can see the advantages of semi-private ownership - which is what John David will effectively have, despite retaining its stock market listing. It allows management to manage for the medium term, not for the next quarter's trading statement. With retailers, where the effects of change are never instant, that is now seen to be a big plus. But nobody would blame small investors if they take their cash and run from JD. Schroders is big enough to look after its own interests, but the rule on mandatory bids is there for a reason: the risks for outside investors increase when one party owns more than half the shares. Pass the butty Unilever shareholders attending the food group's annual meeting were yesterday treated to an interminable pre sentation about its marketing strategy and how its health and food products help \"vitality\". The fact that investors were then offered a white bread fish finger butty as part of their free lunch nicely summed up the gap between Unilever's rhetoric and reality. New chief executive Patrick Cescau gave an astonishingly stodgy performance that part-emptied the hall and made one long for the return of his self-regarding but entertaining predecessor, Niall FitzGerald. One wondered whether Cescau had eaten too many fish fingers or the various other processed foods made by his company rather than heeding the advice in the company's own leaflets, which points out that vitality comes from fresh fruit and veg. There was little attempt to justify the miserable performance of the now scrapped Path to Sloth (sorry, Growth) strategy, but plenty of squirming over why its architect, FitzGerald, left early but still pocketed a \u00a31.2m \"golden goodbye\". One shareholder pointed out the desperate lack of diversity on the board - 15 men, one woman - calling for new blood and ideas. He had a point. The corporate structure has just been shaken up but top jobs are still being filled automatically by long-serving company men such as Cescau. There is an insular feel about Unilever redolent of another troubled Anglo-Dutch group, Shell, accentuated by the fact that Shell boss Jeroen van der Veer recently joined the Unilever board. This rather dull Dutchman has his own work cut out trying to turn around Shell, where he is chief executive, and that may be why he was not at the Unilever meeting. Cescau has some time to see whether his new corporate strategy can really trigger a turnaround but you have to wonder how long it might be before somebody makes a bid."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
