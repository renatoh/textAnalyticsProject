The book - House of Bush, House of Saud: The Secret Relationship Between the World's Two Most powerful Dynasties, by Craig Unger - was due to be published in May by Secker &amp; Warburg, a division of publishing group Random House. It has now cancelled the launch of the book in the UK, fearing the Saudi royals would use British libel laws to discredit the book and sue for damages. Stuart Williams, an editor at Secker &amp; Warburg, confirmed that the book - which went on sale in the US last week - could not be published in the UK because the threat of legal action was too great. \"The only thing we can say is we have been forced to withdraw the book for legal reasons. We cannot go into details. \"It's clear what the book is about and where the threat is,\" he said. The author's agent, Elizabeth Sheinkman, said she was amazed the Saudis had such influence over British publishing. \"The editors were as surprised as the author and I. When we embarked on the project it was understood that due to the differences in libel laws between the US and UK, the UK version would have to be sanitised. \"The book was accepted for publication, this isn't an editorial issue, it's purely legal.\" \"Random House's legal counsel had advised them not to publish the book due to the fact there was a strong legal threat. They recently found out the Wall Street Journal had been sued for a very large amount. \"I think it's understood the outcome of that case could have influenced their decision.\" \"I am surprised at the level of influence the Saudi Arabian government is apparently able to exert on such a large corporation. The book is now on the New York Times' best seller list and the initial print run in the US has sold out. Sheinkman said it was due to be published in Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain and Brazil in the next few months. Craig Unger is a freelance investigative reporter. He was part of the team on the New Yorker that helped break the Iran-Contra story that damaged the Reagan administration and is a former deputy editor of the New York Observer. Although no specific legal threats have been made against Secker &amp; Warburg or the author of the book, it is understood a recent libel victory by a Saudi businessman against the Wall Street Journal's European edition persuaded the publisher it could not defend the book against legal action in the UK. The Wall Street Journal lost a libel case in December launched by Mohammed Abdul Latif Jameel, who flew into the UK to take legal action against the paper after it reported that Saudi security services had been monitoring his company for evidence it had been used to channel funds to terrorists. This subsequently proved to be untrue, and the high court dismissed the Wall Street's defence that it had reported the story in the public interest. Britain's libel laws, which place the onus of proof on the defendant, mean that it has become increasingly attractive to foreign nationals wishing to take action against unfavourable reports or comments in the media. House of Bush, House of Saud assess the close personal and business ties between the Bush and Saud families over the past three decades and the effect of the relationship on the US war on terror. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
