Made fine save from Rooney from point-blank range early in second half, no chance with the goal 6 Mart\u00edn C\u00e1ceres Was lively early on after a poor game against Costa Rica. Still looked vulnerable, as a crude hack on Welbeck demonstrated 6 Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez In only his third international appearance, put in an industrious, unfussy display with some timely interventions 7 Diego God\u00edn Fortunate to stay on after another bookable foul followed his yellow card. But mostly kept tight on England\u2019s front men 5 \u00c1lvaro Perreira Another drafted in after the Costa Rica loss. Tidied up well in defence. Hurt in collision with Sterling but battled on 7 \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez Drafted in on the right side of midfield, pushed up on Baines and mostly bested him and gave Cavani attacking options 6 Egidio-Ar\u00e9valo R\u00edos A notable presence. Kept tight on Rooney and linked up well at times with Lodeiro. A competent, muscular display 7 Crist\u00edan Rodr\u00edguez Might have done better with 15th-minute chance that he blasted narrowly over. Kept quite narrow in the midfield three 6 Nicol\u00e1s Lodeiro Played his part in Uruguay edging control in midfield. Linked up well with Su\u00e1rez and Cavani when given the chance 7 Edinson Cavani A performance full of guile and influence, dropping back where needed and carving out space. Delightful cross for Su\u00e1rez\u2019s first goal 8 Luis Su\u00e1rez A menacing presence, with corners as much as his goal threat. Kept quiet for spells yet took his two chances with typical aplomb 8 ENGLAND Joe Hart Complacent when almost caught out by Su\u00e1rez corners early in each half. Did better when catching a swirling tricky cross 6 Glen Johnson Had his moments going forward, setting up the goal and linking up well with Sturridge and Sterling, but vulnerable at the back 6 Gary Cahill Mostly steady but still out-thought by Uruguay\u2019s front men at vital times. Two fine defensive headers late on 6 Phil Jagielka Paid a heavy price for indecision that left Su\u00e1rez in space to score. Determined, but uncomfortable in possession at times 5 Leighton Baines Grew into the game after a scratchy first-half showing at both ends. Was a more useful attacking outlet after half-time 6 Steven Gerrard Sprayed some good passes but struggled for consistent impact. Booked for a foul on Rodriguez, then at fault for second goal 5 Jordan Henderson A neat and tidy enough performance against opponents that pressed hard in midfield. A couple of telling interceptions 6 Raheem Sterling Was much more tightly policed than against Italy, but still eager to take people on and wriggle into dangerous areas before going off 6 Wayne Rooney Quiet in first half until heading Gerrard\u2019s cross against the bar. His influence grew though, and effort rewarded with a goal 7 Danny Welbeck Always looking for passes from fellow attackers, without showing the freedom or verve he had in Manaus 6 Daniel Sturridge Another whose influence increased after half-time. Always looked to drive forward assertively and had a key role in goal 7"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
