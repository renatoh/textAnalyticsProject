Tricorns off to all!", "bodyText": "\u201cLondon and its strange ways are far, far away!\u201d Ah Demelza. London is not the only place with strange ways, or at least where a great deal of things happen in unimaginably rapid succession. This was a great episode for fans of primitive cave bombs, reckless chasm-jumping, ill-advised derring-do, amateur beachside amputations and bedside waterboarding. My heart was softened by the reappearance of Horace the Pug early on, and as events raced by I alternated between mildly weepy and completely broken. Then Valentine met his half-siblings and I was all puddle. It\u2019s hard to know where to start with this episode, where as many things happened in one hour\u2019s screen time as have happened in the previous four series. And yet it was masterfully managed. Most importantly, though, Horace the Pug returned! He\u2019s put on weight. But obviously that\u2019s his prerogative. Not content with addressing each other in the third person, Dr Enys and Sindy Doll were now speaking to each other exclusively through the dog. I do love these two \u2013 and their chemistry is a great compliment to that of Aidan Turner and Eleanor Tomlinson. These pairings \u2013 alongside the contrasting charms of Jack Farthing (Sir Evil George) and Heida (Ghost Elizabeth) \u2013 have been the backbone of this show. Horace is just the plump cherry on the cake. The scenes at Caroline\u2019s party were delicious; I almost needed a reviving tincture to keep up with it. Questions about the treatment of Sir Evil George\u2019s lunacy. An encounter between Morwenna and the mother of the pig\u2019s-tail-buttocked vicar about Morwenna\u2019s sickly child who has acquired some mastery in fencing. A warning to Demelza about the malice of Tess. Some extraordinary cakes. A brilliant moment between the slave trader and Kitty Despard. And if that weren\u2019t enough plot, here was an accident at the mine with various opportunities for showcasing gore and corpses. Meanwhile Sir Evil George was in an increasingly bad way. \u201cThese will relieve the melancholic congestion of the brain.\u201d Leeches! No! They\u2019re as bad as the terrible tincture Elizabeth took. Bring Dr Enys and his unproven methods to Sir Evil George. A hearty salute to Jack Farthing for inhabiting this difficult role so excellently; even Cary Warleggan thought the waterboarding was a bit much. Thank goodness for a second opinion. \u201cI thought you were about to fall.\u201d \u201cWould it matter?\u201d \u201cI wonder, would you allow me to accompany you back to Trenwith?\u201d Put Dr Enys in charge of all hostage negotiation situations immediately. \u201cThe only lunatic in this room is here. His methods will induce madness, not cure it.\u201d Yes, Dr Enys, speak ye loud! I love the anti-American narrative building up around Prudie in the fragmentary glimpses we get of her. (Not enough Prudie in this series. We demand a Prudie spinoff series, please, alongside the spinoff series for Sir Evil George\u2019s chin.) And moody Tess is superb. \u201cWe aren\u2019t all lucky enough to sell our body to our master for the price of a wedding ring.\u201d Way to tell Demelza to check her privilege. The learnin\u2019 and the smashin\u2019 of prejudice around mental illness, gender and race weigh heavy this series. Was Demelza and Morwenna\u2019s literacy project a step too far? Probably, but never mind. \u201cTruly difference betwixt commons and learned is simply that: learnin\u2019.\u201d Fortunately Poldark has earned the privilege to preach like this and they\u2019re just about getting away with it so far. We shall see if it all gets a bit much as the series progresses. Pewter tankard award for bonkers brilliance as supporting actor T\u2019is a shameful fact that until now, the music has never been mentioned here over five series. Time to remedy that. This week I want to give a melodic tavern shout-out to the composer of the soaring Poldark earworm, Anne Dudley. The theme tune that plays over the title credits is an orchestral arrangement designed \u201cto underscore the Cornish sweeping landscapes and passionate love story.\u201d Top marks to Dudley, who won an Oscar for best score for The Full Monty and has worked on arrangements for The Pet Shop Boys, Elton John and Pulp. May many over-filled tankards be raised aloft to all the excellent musicians involved, and especially to lead violinist Chris Garrick. I have such a Pavlovian response to this theme now (causing immediate lowering of blood pressure) that I am going to miss the music almost as much as Demelza\u2019s National Velvet outfit. Classic Poldark lines \u2022 \u201cNed, I think we\u2019re wanted elsewhere.\u201d The best way ever to say to someone, \u201cIt\u2019s time to leave.\u201d \u2022 \u201cSir George has been called away to the \u2026 north \u2026 of England.\u201d AKA: his bedroom from which banging can be heard. The barbaric north! Genius prevarication. \u2022 \u201cMeanwhile I\u2019m supposed to look Morwenna and Caroline in the face and tell them you\u2019ve all gone fishing?\u201d \u201cExcellent idea.\u201d Ross and Demelza\u2019s relationship in a nutshell. \u2022 \u201cI\u2019ve lost one son to greedy mine-owners, I won\u2019t lose another to highfalutin nonsense.\u201d I would give an Academy Award to John Macneill (Jacka Hoblyn, father of Tommy) purely for his delivery of this line which was beyond reproach in impossible circumstances. One of the great things about Poldark is the strong ensemble cast, many of whom have been in the series since the beginning and inhabit their background roles as if they really are living in the period. Tricorns off to all. \u2022 \u201cI do hold a finger to my tongue. I do hold a finger waiting.\u201d A strange song, t\u2019were indeed, but Demelza sang it well. Regulation reverse sexism bare chest moment As I have predicted, due to the intervention of Aidan Turner\u2019s agent, all of Ross\u2019s feats of derring-do in a hot and sweaty underground cave were conducted not only fully clothed but wearing a fully buttoned-up shirt and an extra waistcoat. Instead we got naked Demelza in the bath. We don\u2019t want naked Demelza in the bath, we want her in her National Velvet costume! Next week Sir Evil George has taken refuge in a world of shadows. Morwenna goes back to her son. Ned goes on the attack. It\u2019s all kicking off, as we would expect as we approach the midway point \u2026"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
