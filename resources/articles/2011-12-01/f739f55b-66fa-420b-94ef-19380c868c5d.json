Aston Villa are the first club to register an interest in taking the highly rated young midfielder and Bolton Wanderers, Swansea City and Fulham are also expected to express interest. Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, the Chelsea manager, could favour the 18-year-old going to Bolton, possibly as a \"sweetener\" for his expected move for the Wanderers centre-half Gary Cahill. McEachran, however, will make the decision that he feels is best for his career. McEachran has grown frustrated at his lack of opportunities at Stamford Bridge. Having been identified as a future star by Villas\u2011Boas, and being included on the pre\u2011season tour of the Far East and promised playing time, he has appeared only once in the Premier League this season, as an 83rd\u2011minute substitute against Swansea. He has made three starts in the Carling Cup. Last season, under the management of Carlo Ancelotti, McEachran made 17 appearances in all competitions, four of them in Chelsea's starting XI. Villa need reinforcements in midfield after losing Jermaine Jenas to a ruptured achilles tendon and they have first-hand experience of McEachran's abilities. He played well and scored against them in the Barclays Asia Trophy pre-season competition. The Swansea manager, Brendan Rodgers, knows McEachran from his own time at Chelsea, where he worked as the youth team manager and later took charge of the reserves. McEachran has represented England at all youth levels and is considered to be the best of Chelsea's academy products."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
