The ceremony took place at a packed Staples Center, the home of the Los Angeles Lakers, the team Bryant was a part of for his entire 20-year NBA career. Bryant and the other victims were killed in January when their helicopter crashed into a California hillside in foggy conditions. The ceremony opened with a performance from Beyonce, before Bryant\u2019s widow, Vanessa, paid tribute to her husband and 13-year-old daughter. She was given a standing ovation by thousands in the crowd and a host of NBA legends including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Stephen Curry and LeBron James. Celebrities such as Kanye West, Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Lopez were also in attendance. Vanessa Bryant thanked the crowd and fans around the world for their condolences, which she said had helped her and her family deal with their grief. She then paid tribute to her \u201cperfect husband\u201d who she said was \u201cthe MVP of girl dads.\u201d She then spoke about Gianna, who she believed had the potential to match Kobe as an international basketball star. \u201cHer smile was like sunshine,\u201d she said. \u201cHer smile took up her entire face. Like me. Kobe always said she was like me. She had my fire, my personality and sarcasm. She was tender and loving on the inside. She had the best laugh. It was infectious. It was pure and genuine.\u201d Vanessa also spoke of the close relationship between Kobe and Gianna. \u201cGod knew they couldn\u2019t be on this earth without each other,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had to bring them home to have them together. Babe, you take care of our Gigi.\u201d Bryant was known as a keen supporter of women\u2019s basketball and several stars of the game spoke of their experiences with him. Sabina Ionescu, the best college player in the US, told the crowd that Bryant, who won five NBA titles with the Lakers, had acted as her mentor. She added that she has continued to text him after his death. \u201cThe last one I sent him said, \u2018I miss you. May you rest in peace, my dear friend,\u2019\u201d Ionescu said. \u201cThe texts go through, but no response. It still feels like he\u2019s there, on the other end. That the next time I pick up my phone, he would have hit me back. Sometimes, I find myself still waiting.\u201d Jordan, widely acknowledge as the greatest NBA player of all time, was in tears as he spoke of his relationship with Bryant. \u201cWhen Kobe Bryant died, a piece of me died,\u201d he said. Both men were known as fierce competitors, but they also forged a bond. \u201cMaybe it surprised people \u2026 but we were very close friends,\u201d said Jordan. \u201cEveryone always wanted to talk about the comparisons between he and I. I just wanted to talk about Kobe.\u201d Jordan added that Bryant had come to him for advice during his career. \u201cAt first, it was an aggravation,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cBut then it turned into a certain passion. This kid had passion like you would never know \u2026 As I got to know him, I wanted to be the best big brother that I could be.\u201d Bryant\u2019s former teammate and fellow Hall of Fame member, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, was next to speak. \u201cKobe and I pushed one another to play some of the greatest basketball of all time and I am proud that no other team has accomplished what the three-peat Lakers have done since the Kobe and Shaq Lakers,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou were taken away from us way too soon.\u201d O\u2019Neal also reduced the crowd to laughter as he remembered Bryant\u2019s fierce drive and spirit. He recalled a time Bryant complained about not getting enough passes in a game. \u201cI said, \u2018There\u2019s no I in team,\u2019 and he said, \u2018Yeah, but there\u2019s a M-E in motherfucker.\u2019\u201d The service was rounded out by a performance from Christina Aguilera, who sang Ave Maria. Bryant is survived by his parents, Vanessa and his three other daughters Natalia, Bianka and Capri. On Monday, it was also announced that Vanessa has filed a lawsuit against the company that owned the helicopter in which Kobe, Gianna and the other victims were killed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
