The candidate chats amiably with Conservative voters who handily share his views on Brexit, crime, education and tax cuts. Highlights include a rather half-hearted air punch as Johnson tells one woman that Britain just needs to believe in itself more, and Johnson\u2019s new sensible leadership challenge haircut. The video has a dig at the Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, over crime in the capital. (By happy coincidence, Donald Trump criticised Khan as soon as he landed in the UK on Monday.) Perhaps wisely though, with a court case looming over the leave campaign\u2019s \u00a3350m NHS promise, Johnson avoids making any costed pledges in his video. Michael Gove There\u2019s a markedly different approach from Gove, whose video starts with a supercut of previous speeches. Gove then says it isn\u2019t enough just to \u201cbelieve\u201d in Brexit, you need to be able to deliver it. He cites his record in government on environmental and educational issues, although children learning punctuation may have some questions about why Gove\u2019s name at the end of the video has a full stop. Dominic Raab Raab turned heads last week with a head-turning opening to his campaign video. Looking like an owl spinning its head round to focus on its prey, Raab preaches fairness, for which he claims to have been fighting all his life. (The feminists he has described as \u201cobnoxious bigots\u201d might beg to differ.) Raab is ahead of the game on Facebook, having already spent more than \u00a36,000 on adverts there. Matt Hancock Rather more energetically, the health secretary has been posting videos of himself playing cricket in the workplace. With the World Cup starting in England, Matt Hancock appeared in a video that looked like it could have been posted by David Brent from The Office, offering his services if England were to need any last-minute squad replacements. Needless to say, he took the most dramatic catch in the clip \u2013 diving headlong across the office in his best Ben Stokes impression. Hancock does have form \u2013 last year he posted clips of himself playing street cricket during an official visit to India. Rory Stewart \u201cFlorence of Belgravia\u201d has become the unexpected social media star of the campaign, but one of his early videos caused a stir when he was asked if he was holding out his arm as if taking a selfie while his phone appeared to be on a tripod. The following exchange about it was, at least, a refreshingly honest reply from a politician being caught out in a public act of deception. Stewart has subsequently adopted a more shaky aesthetic as he wanders around the country chatting to people, using the #rorywalks hashtag. A stint at Speakers\u2019 Corner in London is scheduled for 6pm on Monday. There\u2019s a suspicion that Stewart isn\u2019t really bidding to be leader at all but just auditioning for the \u201clovable cuddly Tory\u201d role that Ken Clarke will vacate at some point. Clarke, of course, has endorsed Stewart. Sajid Javid The home secretary has opted for a much more formal indoor setting for his #TeamSaj campaign video. One thing #TeamSaj might consider is employing the services of a sound engineer: despite having multiple camera angles, Javid sounds like he\u2019s being recorded underwater in a wind tunnel. He has, though, recorded the best social media retort of the campaign so far. The launch videos so far have been male-dominated. Andrea Leadsom and Esther McVey have preferred to post clips of media appearances on Twitter and Facebook rather than bespoke videos. Kit Malthouse Malthouse has run a low-key social media campaign for the top job, although the housing minister has at least demonstrated a grasp of the fact that the internet loves cats. James Cleverly Cleverly has opted for a nostalgic look back at where he grew up in Lewisham as the background to the \u201cconversation\u201d he is promising with the British people. Bonus points to the director for including an old family photo that makes clear Cleverly served in the army without the candidate having to mention it. Jeremy Hunt Hunt has posted a series of videos, and one that stands out is a short clip filmed while out campaigning for this week\u2019s byelection in Peterborough. He boasts about once having turned a marginal seat into one with a majority of 20,000. It might seem like an odd pitch to unite and lead the nation, but Hunt clearly has his eye on who the real electorate is for the UK\u2019s next prime minister: Conservative party activists. Just keep him away from bells while on camera. And the one making way One crumb of comfort for all the contenders is that they will be hard-pushed to produce a campaign video as stilted and awkward as Theresa May\u2019s fireside Brexit chat from April, which already feels like a long, long time ago."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
