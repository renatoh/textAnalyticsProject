Arsenal \u2013 then the best team in the land (kids, ask granny) \u2013 faced Arsenal Reserves in a training match at Highbury, the only ground the Beeb could reach from their Alexandra Palace studio with their big roll of cable. Eighty-two years on, Amazon joined the fray, and history soon repeated itself. On Tuesday night \u2013 using exactly the same vintage BBC equipment, if the way The Fiver\u2019s picture regularly slipped in and out of focus was any guide \u2013 the newest broadcaster on the scene also premiered with a dull training run-out. Manchester City\u2019s gentle trot around Turf Moor made for viewing nearly as captivating as the eight hours of All or Nothing. Thanks, Jeff Bezos! More, please! And indeed there will be more. Much more. Wednesday\u2019s line-up on Amazon includes the Merseyside derby, Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea\u2019s Frank Lampard versus Plain Old John Terry, another tense relegation six-pointer at St Mary\u2019s, and a festive panto from Manchester in which Humility Man\u2122, the boy who never grew up, returns to Neverland. It\u2019s a schedule sure to go down in broadcasting lore, alongside those legendary Christmas Days when BBC1 aired The Generation Game, Mike Yarwood and Morecambe and Wise, the must-see-TV nights on NBC when Friends was followed by Seinfeld and ER, and of course Television Service\u2019s memorable triple whammy of 3.40pm Football at the Arsenal, 3.55pm Cartoon, 4pm Closedown. Thanks again, Jeff! The biggest match in the listings is ostensibly the one at Anfield, where league leaders Liverpool defend their long unbeaten run against Everton. But anyone who remembers Wayne Clarke and what he did in 1988 \u2013 another question for granny, perhaps \u2013 already knows how that one is likely to end. It\u2019s just going to happen, isn\u2019t it. So perhaps the more intriguing programme is the panto. Manchester United are currently enduring their worst start to a league season in 31 years, so the last person anyone at Old Trafford wants to see is \u2026 look out, Ole! He\u2019s behind you! Yes, it promises to be a proper night of entertainment, and it\u2019s all live on Amazon. Thanks in advance for all the fun, Jeff, and especially for the chance to cough up an extra eight quid for some stuff we already had. Thanks! LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Simon Burnton from 7.30pm GMT for hot Premier League clockwatch action, while Scott Murray will be on hand for Liverpool 1-2 Everton at 8.15pm. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI feel absolutely honoured to be getting abuse from Man City fans \u2026 it\u2019s made me emosh! You lot should be worrying and tweeting Man\u00e9 and Salah not Tom \u2018the carthorse\u2019 Pope you plantpots\u201d \u2013 Port Vale\u2019s Tom Pope responds after notoriously mild-mannered Manchester City fans on Social Media Disgrace Twitter dug up his post from June, in which he declared: \u201cJust watched the highlights of the England game!

FIVER LETTERS \u201cMark Husbands suggested a Fiver alternative to the Ballon d\u2019Or, consisting of a \u2018gold-painted, recycled exit sign, bearing the legend Do One in the font of your choice\u2019 (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters). Am I the only one who suspects the font The Fiver would choose would be Comic Sans?\u201d \u2013 Nick Jeffery. \u201cFurther to Mark\u2019s wise suggestion, I propose the Ballon d\u2019Oh. It\u2019s a Simpsons-themed annual award. My first nomination is Daniel Levy and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho as Montgomery Burns and the fawning Smithers. Also on the list is Phil Brown as any character drawn in a yellowish-orange hue\u201d \u2013 Mike Wilner. \u201cBy suggesting we make a play into touch with the shiny baubles awarded on Monday night, has The Fiver inadvertently (or advertently?) stopped the STOP FOOTBALL campaign? Apathetic readers need to know\u201d \u2013 Matt Richman. \u201cI guess I won\u2019t be the first or the last to ask, but any chance of awarding me letter o\u2019 the day so that I can give my football-loving old man something other than a couple of cans of Tin this festive season? Preferably on a day when there\u2019s a prize going. Thanks\u201d \u2013 Johnny Mac. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Johnny Mac, who bags a copy of Forgotten Nations. We\u2019ve still got more prizes to give away, so get scribbling.
