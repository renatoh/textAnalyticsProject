The company will use new technologies to bypass BT completely and provide internet, telephone and other broadband-related services direct to its customers. Companies like Bulldog have brought the cost of broadband to an all-time low by taking advantage of the same local loop unbundling (LLU) technologies which AOL is now investing in. However the American firm said it would not be cutting prices but would invest the savings it will make through lower ongoing running costs in providing a better service. \"The market is already at its low point in terms of pricing,\" said spokesman Jonathan Lambeth. \"Bulldog is pricing itself ahead to the levels that LLU may eventually allow costs to come down to. What we need to see now is who can offer the most value.\" AOL is promising to increase speeds for customers and offer extra features such as the ability to receive TV through a broadband connection, video on demand and advanced gaming services. The initial phase of its LLU programme, costing \u00a350m, will take place in the first half of 2006 and will reach the equivalent of 20% of UK households. If successful, AOL will roll out to an additional 50% at a cost of \u00a370m. Blair Wadman, broadband product manager for price comparison website Uswitch.com, said the move would allow AOL to compete on a level playing field with BT in terms of both phone lines and broadband. \"The only other company at the moment is Bulldog, which is only in the major cities,\" he said. \"AOL are backed by Time Warner and there's the potential there for them to roll out across the whole country far faster than one would have thought Bulldog capable of.\" Bulldog currently offers up to 8 meg speed broadband for \u00a39.75 a month, while BT offers slower 2 meg speeds from \u00a314.99 a month. For the time being AOL will continue to offer its customers 1 meg broadband at a cost of \u00a314.99 for the first six months and \u00a317.99 thereafter. \"We've never been the cheapest and don't aim to be,\" said Mr Lambeth. \"We would say we have the best customer service and provide better value for money.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
