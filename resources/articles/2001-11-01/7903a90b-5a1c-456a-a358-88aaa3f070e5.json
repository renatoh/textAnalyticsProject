If you want a scoop, the place to go is the Football Association's website, www.the-fa.org. Today, that esteemed organ announced it had two \"exclusives\": the naming of the 26-man England squad to face Sweden this Saturday; and an interview with FA employee Sven-Goran Eriksson. Now, some might say that's like the Guardian announcing an \"exclusive\" chat with comment and analysis queen Polly Toynbee. But not us. According to the FA's Exclusive #1 - now that's an indie band name if ever we heard one - Eriksson has named a \"strong-looking 26-man party\" including the recalled Kevin Phillips and Darren Anderton as well as fringe members like Frank Lampard (Happy Mondays), Danny Murphy (Shed Seven) and Trevor Sinclair (bass player from the Boo Radleys, or maybe it was the drummer). Soon FA Exclusive #2 - which doesn't sound like such a good band name - was up on the site, and the Fiver was able to enjoy some enlightening exchanges. (FA: \"Can we expect many substitutions?\" Sven-Goran Eriksson: \"Yes, I think so.\") In fairness, Eriksson went on to explain his decisions, saying that Phillips was \"playing much better this season and so I am interested to see him\", while Anderton \"is doing well and playing regularly\". OK, it's neither Shakepeare nor Swedish Nobel Laureate Selma Lagerl\u00f6f, but if England keep winning, we doubt anyone will care. The squad: Martyn, Wright, Walker; G Neville, R Ferdinand, Ehiogu, Keown, Southgate, Carragher, Neville, Mills, Powell; Beckham, Scholes, Butt, Gerrard, Murphy, Sinclair, Anderton, Lampard; Fowler, Heskey, Owen, Sheringham, Phillips, Smith. IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER \"There's only one Jaap Stam,\" sang those cheeky Scouse wags after 4ft 7ins Michael Owen had got down on one knee to beat the entire Manchester United defence and nod home the goal which killed off United's chance of ever winning another trophy ever again (we think). But those cheeky Scouse wags were wrong, because United's scouts reckon they've found another replacement for the literary giant they flogged to Lazio. And his name is Fernando Sanz. Sadly for United, these are probably the same scouts who rubber-stamped the purchase of Jordi and Laurent Blanc. For Fernando Sanz is: the central defender who is famous for being the son of former Real Madrid president Lorenzo Sanz; the central defender who is famous for being the husband of TV-presenter-and in-no-way-soft-porn-star Ingrid Asensio; the central defender who is not famous for being good at football. In six seasons at daddy's club, he made just 35 appearances. And they were normally as club mascot. His present club Malaga - who today told onefootball.com they had received an offer from United - are clearly reluctant to let Sanz go (for less than quadruple what he is worth). \"Every player has a buy-out clause,\" said president Serafin Roldan, doubtless adding a few squillion pesetas to Sanz's \u00a312m buy-out figure when he heard United were out bargain-hunting. \"Sanz would be free to leave in the January transfer window,\" he ker-chinged. He seems a bit too willing to let Sanz go, doesn't he? QUOTE OF THE DAY \"There are trees and flowers and water and beauty out there. We don't always have to talk about nuclear waste\" - Turkey coach Senol Gunes comes across all Jarvis Cocker in response to reporters unsure of his side's chances in the World Cup play-off against Austria. Well, it makes a change from the \"11 v 11\" stuff, doesn't it? HE NEEDS A PETIT TIME TO HIMSELF He's got the physique of George Clooney and the work ethic of George Roper. He Is Emmanuel Petit, and he really can't be bothered. Two weeks ago he refused to travel to Tel Aviv. Because he fancied a bit of feet-up with the racing section, perhaps? So out came the age-old \"Osama Bin Laden might take time off from waging a holy war against the infidel to murder some French footballers\" excuse. Now, today, he's decided to throw a sickie because he can't be arsed to go to Australia with France. \"I have had to pull out,\" he wrote on his personal website, probably using voice-activated software so he didn't have to move any of his fingers. \"After the fuss surrounding the trip to Australia, I know there will be people out there criticising me again,\" the lazy sod continued presciently. \"But if they want, I will show them my ankle. The swelling has gone down in the last few days but it is still very painful. It would be unthinkable to go to Australia in this state.\" At this point, Petit tired of entering the text himself, and called for some assistance. A secretary entered the room and Manu, resting very still, concluded his statement using the series of coded blinks he devised to aid communication in times of total ennui. \"I have spoken to [France coach] Roger Lemerre on the phone and he knows perfectly well I don't hide. I am not a liar.\" We never said you were, mate. Which is why we take it you won't be spotted walking around any designer clothes shops until your foot is totally better. THE RUMOUR MILL Juan Pablo Angel and Dwight Yorke have both been linked with a move to Juventus. Real Madrid president Florentino Perez is planning another \u00a340m bid for Andriy Shevchenko. Carlo Ancelotti has not accepted an offer to take over at Parma, because he is hoping that Fatih Terim will be sacked as AC Milan coach. NEWS IN BRIEF Republic of Ireland winger Mark Kennedy will miss Saturday's World Cup play-off first leg against Iran because of hamstring trouble. Aston Villa midfielder George Boateng has received his first call-up to the Dutch international squad for Saturday's friendly against Denmark in Copenhagen. Oh, Safe Hands! Dutch manager Louis van Gaal has dropped Liverpool's out-of-favour goalkeeper Sander Westerveld in favour of AZ Alkmaar's Oscar Moens. Alen Boksic has withdrawn from Croatia's squad for two friendlies against South Korea in favour of a holiday in Italy. \"I am not going to South Korea because it is very hard travelling,\" said the put-upon Middlesbrough striker. Boksic more workshy than Bilko: discuss. Lucas Neill has pulled out of Australia's squad for their friendly against France and world cup play-off against the fifth-placed team in the South American qualifying group, after sustaining a knee injury in Blackburn's 2-1 win at Southampton. Crewe striker Paul Tait has joined Hull on a one-month loan. TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV1: The Premiership (11.45pm) Friday's pointless puzzlers have had you talking dirty all weekend. We asked why dog turd doesn't turn white anymore like it used to when we were kids. Uefa Big Cup Weekly (12.50am) \"It used to turn white because there was loads of ash in it (a gag used in the Simpsons, incidentally. Whenever Marge tips out a can for Snowball or Santa's Little Helper there's always a cloud of ash),\" suggests Justin Steed. Nationwide Football League Extra (1.15am) Alistair Reid agrees, more or less. \"It's because they don't use chalk-based bulking agent (sorry that should have read as added calcium) any more.\" Sky Sports 1: Ford Monday Night Football Special: (8pm) But why don't they put chalk/ash in it any more? \"I understand that you can blame the demise of the Old White Crumbly on those paper shuffling bureaucrats in Europe,\" begins Nick Barnes. You're On Sky Sports! (10pm) \"Apparently there used to be a lot of chalk in dog food, added to the mix as a filler to pad out the gaps between those 'meaty' chunks, but this practice has now been banned - hence the old white crumbly is no more.\" World Football Show (11pm) Is this really the reason? \"Dunno,\" says Chrisp, \"but I once chanced upon a dog poo that contained a white sock! Explain that.\" ITV Sport Channel: Worthington Cup (7pm) If you think this is all a load of s****, then check out this official press release from the Canine Health Concern on the world wide internet, which Richard Marsden clearly spent far too much time google-finding: http://www.asr-svcs.dircon.co.uk/wwwchc/poo.htm. Their advice? \"For a healthy dog and a cleaner planet, give your dog a bone.\" Radio Five Live: Sport on Five with Ian Payne (7pm) So that clears up the dog mess, but what about those other teasers of our time? Can you make a good living from working in the circus? Are there any urban badgers? The.boss@theguardian.com needs to know."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
