An extraordinary Blackburn comeback, featuring two goals in the final eight minutes after Tottenham's Wilson Palacios had been incorrectly dismissed, will surely be enough to keep Sam Allardyce's in-form team in the top flight. For Spurs, despite a league run in 2009 that had only been bettered by the top four and Everton, lingering hopes of competing for an unlikely place in Europe next season seem to have been removed thanks, as the manager Harry Redknapp was swift to point out, to Peter Walton. \"The sending off was wrong. It was diabolical,\" said Redknapp after the referee twice booked Palacios within 60 seconds for fouls on David Dunn. \"It was the second tackle; he didn't touch him. The referee was completely wrong. He does his best, bless him, but he makes a lot of mistakes. I have seen him do it before. I said to the players at half-time that he would do something to try to even things up. I thought he would give a penalty or a free-kick or a sending off, and I was right. \"It's disappointing, but we can build a team from here. I have good players. We were bottom when I came to the club and we could have gone seventh today. I have players who can play and that is what I want. I want my teams to play on the floor. That is the way that I know. I would rather play that way.\" Until Palacios's 79th minute departure Tottenham had comfortably handled anything Rovers had thrown at them, whether route one or not. Spurs' dominance was absolute and, yet, they had only Robbie Keane's penalty to show for their endeavours. Ga\u00ebl Givet was harshly adjudged to have handled an Aaron Lennon cross when it seemed more a case of ball hitting hand, and Walton further angered Rovers players and supporters by refusing to even investigate their claims that Keane placed the ball in front of the penalty spot before beating Paul Robinson with the kick. As predicted by Redknapp in the dressing room at half-time, Walton's influence on the game was not over, and his decision to dismiss Palacios contributed to a quite remarkable Spurs capitulation. That display by his team and some inevitable questionable goalkeeping from Heurelho Gomes \u2013 not Blackburn's alleged route one approach, not Walton's ineptitude \u2013 might have been a more appropriate target for Redknapp's ire. In the 82nd minute, the previously immaculate Jonathan Woodgate allowed the emergency forward Christopher Samba to gather a long ball, turn and play in the unmarked Benni McCarthy for the equaliser. And three minutes from time, Ledley King and Samba tussled at the near post as El Hadji Diouf's corner came across, Gomes flapped, and Andre Ooijer stood unhindered as he forced in the ball. Christopher Samba in each half, having been pushed up front at half-time The Blackburn relief was absolute although Diouf, true to character, managed to play the role of graceless winner, seeming to celebrate in front of the Tottenham fans and their goalkeeper on the final whistle. Gomes, certainly, interpreted Diouf's gestures as inflammatory and the pair had to be separated. \"Diouf is an emotional guy,\" said the Rovers defender Ryan Nelsen. \"He brings a lot of personality to the team and I mean that in the right sort of way. Since he's come here he has been fantastic, a real breath of fresh air. He's hungry and he wants to win. So maybe it was just a bit of that. \"What you have to understand is that he is cut from a different mould to a lot of us. But to me that's awesome; it would be boring if we were all the same. He's a fantastic lad and an emotional guy. He wants to win so badly when he's on the field and people can sometimes take it the wrong way. Maybe that's what's happened.\" Had Tottenham displayed a similar will to win, the Senegalese would have had no cause to celebrate.
