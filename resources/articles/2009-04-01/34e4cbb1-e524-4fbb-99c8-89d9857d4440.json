What crisis, Coe tells Olympic chiefs checking London's plans", "bodyText": "The London 2012 chairman, Sebastian Coe, will this week seek to reassure inspectors from the International Olympic Committee that the global economic meltdown has not derailed preparations or dealt a substantial blow to its finances. Since the IOC coordination commission was last in London, a year ago, the global financial system has been shaken to its foundations, leaving the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (Locog) with the task of delivering a Games in the worst economic climate since the early 1970s. But Coe said he would be telling the coordination commission chairman, Denis Oswald, that the recession had made \"very little\" impact on its work, funded by \u00a32bn of private money secured through its own sponsors. \"If you speak to most people anywhere in the world, they are having a hard time, so it's very important that they don't think it's impacting upon us because it's not,\" said Coe. \"We are delivering in a very strong way \u2013 partly due to the strength of our team and partly due to the strength of the Olympic brand that is punching through in an area where most other things are not punching through, and they should recognise that, too.\" He said the worsening economic climate had shifted attitudes among those who previously didn't support the Games, for they recognised its value in driving investment and employment. \"Even people that have not innately 'got' the Games recognise that this is a pretty important project to have,\" he said. The IOC, which gave London organisers a score of \"9.75 out of 10\" last time it was in town, will also be seeking updates on the latest deliberations over venues. Locog recently reaffirmed its determination to stage equestrian events in Greenwich Park \u2013 a plan that has been opposed by a pressure group of local residents who fear it will harm the historic parkland \u2013 and to stage the shooting events at the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich. Both decisions have also been criticised by some in the sports for not leaving a legacy. There is also still a question mark over whether to build a temporary structure to house badminton and other sports or move them to the ExCeL centre. Boxing could yet be moved to Wembley Arena. The focus will start to move to operational matters like ticketing, transport, security and sponsorship. Although there is disquiet around the delivery of the various \"legacy promises\" that helped win the bid \u2013 inspiring a generation of young people through sport, regenerating London's East End and boosting grass-roots participation \u2013 the chief executive, Paul Deighton, said the IOC would focus on Locog's job of delivering a successful Games. Despite the economic downturn, Deighton said Locog's success in securing the majority of the \u00a3480m it has earned in sponsorship before the worst of the downturn was felt meant it was still well placed. Its sponsorship target is \u00a3700m. He said sponsors could be convinced to pour in more money to support the new Team 2012 scheme, which is designed to help plug a \u00a350m shortfall in funding for athletes in the run-up to the Games. Deighton said the scheme, which is proving unpopular with some athletes worried that it will affect their own marketability with sponsors, would aim to bring in \u00a320m. Locog has already begun work on its ticketing strategy, with the aim of ensuring every session of every sport is attended by enthusiasts. Some tickets will be distributed via sports clubs and there will also be specific marketing efforts aimed at overseas visitors and expanding the appeal of some sports. Deighton backed the London mayor Boris Johnson's plan of having groups of local schoolchildren on standby to take tickets that have not been sold or used by corporate sponsors. \"[For] tickets that are not used at the last minute or [if] people don't turn up or people leave early or where you haven't managed to sell the ticket for whatever reason,\" he said, \"the thing you need is a large group of available people who are prepared to be mobilised at short notice into those seats.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
