Nevertheless, their recent appearance on the red carpet (Grant, elegant with natural grey hair) was hailed as refreshing, even groundbreaking. So it goes with the twisted maths of male-female age-appropriateness, especially in Hollywood \u2013 a man seen with anyone who isn\u2019t half his age is hailed as a feminist god walking among us. But why wouldn\u2019t Reeves date Grant? She appears to be smart, talented, fun, a catch. But this is beyond one couple \u2013 this is about the gender politics of success and how society tells successful men that they \u201cdeserve\u201d not only a beautiful, but also a much younger woman. At least this (smallish age gap) counts as a novelty. Usually, we nosy types find the larger age gaps intriguing. Some such relationships defy the odds and work. Others look unhealthy, especially if one party is not just younger, but also young, period \u2013 too young for them to have much hope of real agency in their relationship. Then there\u2019s that other kind of age gap, with the freaky gendered socioeconomic dimension \u2013 where snagging a much younger woman becomes as much a signifier of male success as a mansion or a Porsche. Here, the younger woman is less a human being than a male acquisition or achievement. I always wondered why some men were forever moaning nastily about gold-diggers. It finally dawned that perhaps it\u2019s because they are intoxicated with this idea of womankind confirming their financial success. \u201cLook, everybody, I\u2019m so successful, I\u2019m being played by gold-diggers!\u201d There lies the essential tragedy of the money-obsessed \u2013 it even contaminates their sexual and emotional life. For women, the rules are different. Helena Bonham Carter has just been in the news with a much younger partner and you\u2019d have thought that witchcraft (bubbling cauldrons, the lot) must have been involved for this 53-year-old to lure this younger man into her aged lair. It barely matters that Bonham Carter is beautiful, talented and successful. That, these days, she\u2019d be called a cougar rather than a crone. Still, society decrees that a woman\u2019s status is rarely improved by her having a much younger male partner; if anything, it\u2019s sacrificed. If all this is a grisly tangle of double standards, then the irony and comedy deepens with the realisation that Reeves and Grant (two people who just dig each other) would be likely to attract as much suspicion from some quarters as large age gaps do in others. That, to certain eyes, Hollywood star Reeves has \u201csettled\u201d for a 46-year-old and, in the process, horribly let himself \u2013 and all chauvinist mankind \u2013 down. If this red carpet incident proved anything, it\u2019s that the age gap is as socially and sexually politicised as ever. Don\u2019t cry for Samantha, Dave was bad news for Britain Does anyone know the whereabouts of the world\u2019s tiniest violin? I\u2019m talking microscopic, and I need it urgently. Samantha Cameron has spoken at a business event about how the unpopularity of her husband, former prime minister David, might be adversely affecting her luxury fashion brand, Cefinn. As in, some people don\u2019t fancy buying expensive clobber from the wife of the man who caused Brexit and then, well, you know, scarpered. This isn\u2019t an attack on Ms Cameron. She wasn\u2019t responsible for calling the referendum and she readily admits that being part of a famous couple could also help sales. There might be just a small problem with self-awareness: she says she rarely goes into overdraft, which leads one to wonder: could this have anything to do with her being not only the wife of a former PM, but also the daughter of a baronet? Generally, I\u2019m so kindly disposed towards Ms Cameron that, after perusing the Cefinn website, I\u2019m prepared to receive free clothes (perhaps that Carly Cropped Faux Fur Coat \u2013 \u00a3420?). On receipt, I could report back to Cefinn on whether I\u2019m overcome with hostility towards said garment. (perhaps chuck in the Riley Funnel Neck Blouse \u00a3170, in every colour, just to be sure?). \u201cBribery\u201d is such an ugly word \u2013 let\u2019s call it \u201ccustomer feedback\u201d. As for David Cameron being bad for business, tell the nation something it doesn\u2019t know. It\u2019s darkly amusing that in the chaos and rubble of our times, there\u2019s yet another casualty \u2013 in the form of Samantha Cameron\u2019s frocks and jumpers not selling as well as they could do. This is why we need that tiny violin \u2013 not just for Samantha, but for ourselves. If only this were the biggest problem the UK faced. If breakfast with Trump is top prize, can I be a runner-up? How much would you pay not to have breakfast with President Donald Trump? What if I threw in the chance to miss lunch and dinner too? I\u2019m asking because Trump has once again managed to cause controversy via the medium of food. Many will recall how, earlier this year, he served the Clemson Tigers football team a White House banquet of hamburgers and fries. Now Trump is accused of holding lotteries to dine with him, but not following through. In what\u2019s been criticised as a fundraising scam, winners are fobbed off with photo opportunities or nothing at all. Why is Trump, man of the people, trying to avoid chowing down with the wonderful ordinary folk he professes to represent? Then again, who wants to watch Trump masticate anyway? Imagine that, sitting opposite you, tucking into egg and soldiers. Watching those weird tiny hands struggling with adult cutlery, a person could clean forget elementary table etiquette: \u201cWhich fork should I use to stick in your neck, Mr President?\u201d Trump\u2019s fundraising team missed a trick. Instead of dining with the president, they could have offered people a cast-iron guarantee that they\u2019d never have to encounter Trump while eating. A solemn promise of Trump-free digestion all day. That really would be a reason to get the wallet out. \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
