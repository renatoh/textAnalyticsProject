Geffen, net worth $7.7bn according to Forbes, sent a virtual postcard to his 84,000 Instagram followers on Saturday morning, to let them know he too was feeling the hardships of enforced solitude. \u201cSunset last night\u2026\u201d Geffen wrote, to accompany a travel brochure-quality photograph of his vessel resting at anchor in the picturesque Caribbean sea. \u201cIsolated in the Grenadines avoiding the virus. I hope everybody is staying safe.\u201d Social media users were quick to leap on the tone-deaf post. \u201cDavid Geffen sends a message: You poor plebs can suck it. It\u2019s fabulous to be rich! Look at me!\u201d stock market analyst Sven Henrich wrote on Twitter. Others referred to the Geffen\u2019s background as a producer and record label owner who has worked with hundreds of big-name artists. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason people thought Carly Simon\u2019s You\u2019re So Vain was about David Geffen,\u201d one Twitter user wrote, referring to the decades-long guessing game over the protagonist of the singer\u2019s 1972 hit. Another suggested that Geffen, 77, could be doing more to counter the pandemic. \u201cDavid Geffen is out of touch,\u201d the Twitter user wrote. \u201cMaybe if he made a large donation for medical protective gear for our overworked nurses, doctors &amp; medical staff, he wouldn\u2019t come off as an elitist jerk.\u201d In the mogul\u2019s defense, the David Geffen Foundation has over the years directed many hundreds of millions of dollars to philanthropic causes including medical and health clinics and charities for the homeless. The school of medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles is named for him. Still, a self-pitying missive from the Caribbean hinting at the adversity of staring down the Coronavirus aboard a $590m floating palace with a crew of 45 will hardly resonate with the harsh reality now facing millions of Americans. \u201cCan I come?\u201d Showbiz 411 journalist Roger Friedman wondered. \u201cWhere do I pick up the launch \u2026 or do I just \u2018copter down onto the landing pad?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
