The reason could be in their genes", "bodyText": "Parents who are driven to distraction by their toddler\u2019s picky eating can take comfort in the fact that it\u2019s just as likely to be down to nature as nurture. According to research into the behaviour of 16-month old children, fussy eating and a refusal to try new foods are both heavily influenced by the child\u2019s genetic makeup, and are not just a result of upbringing. \u201cThat these traits were so significantly influenced by genes so early on really indicates how innate the tendency is, and that it is not because of the parents that are kind of moulding [children] into fussy eaters - it is already there when they are 16 months old,\u201d said Andrea Smith, PhD student and lead author of the research from University College, London. But, she adds, shared environmental factors such as the home setting also play an important role, and parents should be reassured that fussy eating behaviour can be modified. Writing in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, researchers from the UK and Norway describe how they sought to probe the impact of genetics on the eating behaviour of toddlers by harnessing data from twins registered with a large UK project known as Gemini. More than 1,900 families with twins aged 16 months took part in the study. Parents completed a questionnaire which investigated the eating habits of their toddlers, including whether the children enjoyed eating a variety of foods and whether they refused new foods. By looking at how similar the results were from identical twins (who share all their genes) compared with how similar they were from fraternal twins (who share on average 50% of the genes that make people different), the researchers were able to tease apart the influence of genetic factors on the eating behaviour of the children. The findings showed that fussy eaters were also likely to reject unfamiliar foods, with many of the environmental and genetic factors common to both traits. What\u2019s more, the results suggest that genes play a key role in the eating behaviour of the children. \u201cAt 16 months we found that overall 46% of the variation in food fussiness was explained by genes, and we found that 58% of food neophobia (rejection of new foods) was explained by genes,\u201d said Smith. Shared environment factors, such as home life, affected both traits, exerting an equal effect to genes on variations in food fussiness, but a smaller effect on food neophobia. That suggests that despite the genetic tendencies, parental actions can still influence toddler behaviour, the authors say. \u201cWe know that genes are not our destiny,\u201d said Smith. \u201cParents can positively influence their child\u2019s eating behaviours.\u201d Smith says that parents should not force or bribe their child to eat a \u201cproblem\u201d food but instead repeatedly offer it to the child outside of mealtimes and praise any attempt by the child to touch or smell it. It is not know exactly which genes are involved in influencing picky eating and the refusal of unfamiliar food, but Smith says that many genes are likely to play a role. \u201cThere will never been one gene which is the food fussiness genes - they are a lot of different ones,\u201d she said. \u201cThese genetic effects might be working through slight differences in personality in eating behaviours, in how sensitive individuals are to texture and flavours, to how extroverted and how open they are to new situations.\u201d While previous studies have highlighted the influence of genes on such eating behaviours in older children and adults, the new study, says Smith, shows that such genes exert a heavy influence from an early age. Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King\u2019s College London, who was not involved in the study, agrees that the study offers parents an optimistic outlook. \u201cEvery kid is different,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a genetic tendency to be more or less fussy.\u201d But, he adds, parents should take heart that such behaviour isn\u2019t immutable. \u201cYou can modify it by changing the family\u2019s habits, the way you present food to the child and the whole concept of the mealtime,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
