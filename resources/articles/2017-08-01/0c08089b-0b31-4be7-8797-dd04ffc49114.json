That transgression on the part of the Newcastle United midfielder \u2013 Ben\u00edtez\u2019s captain for the day \u2013 played a big part in the newly promoted side marking their return to the top tier with a disappointing 2-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. Goals from Alli and Ben Davies \u2013 both scored after Shelvey\u2019s 48th-minute dismissal \u2013 briefly assuaged Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s disappointment at his board\u2019s failure to reinforce his Spurs squad with a single new face this summer while dismaying his Newcastle counterpart. \u201cJonjo knows he has made a mistake and he apologised in the dressing room afterwards,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez, who felt that Tottenham\u2019s Harry Kane should have been shown a red rather than a yellow card for a first-half tackle on Florian Lejeune, which left the centre-half barely able to walk and unable to continue. \u201cThe tackle from behind from Harry Kane was worse than what Jonjo did,\u201d said Newcastle\u2019s manager whose side defended very well until the sending-off. \u201cBut the rules are the rules and we paid for that. It\u2019s not just me, Jonjo has let everyone down, we\u2019ve talked about it for a while. If you want to win Premier League games you can\u2019t lose focus for one minute. \u201cIf we want to win Premier League games we have to do everything really well. I was happy with the effort of my players today and there were a lot of positives but all the effort we put in on the pitch was lost because we did one mistake.\u201d Mike Ashley made a rare appearance in the directors\u2019 box but, asked whether he intended to have face-to-face discussions with Newcastle\u2019s owner on Sunday night Ben\u00edtez side-stepped the question. \u201cI have to concentrate on my team,\u201d said a manager openly \u201cunhappy\u201d at this lack of transfer market support this summer. \u201cI don\u2019t know if any signings are close but we know what we need and we know what we have to do.\u201d Although Pochettino is still waiting to welcome his first new face of the summer, Tottenham\u2019s manager was considerably happier. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was important for us to get three points to change the memories of the last time we played here [when Spurs lost 5-1 in May 2016]. \u201cNewcastle defended so deep it was difficult for us to find space in the first half but we played better in the second half and we would, of course, have won without the sending off.\u201d He expressed a certain sympathy with Ben\u00edtez while disagreeing with him over Kane\u2019s tackle. \u201cI think it\u2019s difficult,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cViewed from another side, it\u2019s completely different. It\u2019s not fair to say it merits the same punishment as Shelvey.\u201d After praising debutant right back Kyle Walker-Peters, the Argentinian dropped another hint about the need for reinforcements. \u201cWe need some new players,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot of games in the Premier League and the Champions League. We need more quality, more competition.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
