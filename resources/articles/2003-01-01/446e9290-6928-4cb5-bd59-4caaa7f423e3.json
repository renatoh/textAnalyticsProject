The Wish You Were Here feature, the second part of a film about Kelly's trip on the trans Siberian railway, is due to be broadcast on ITV1 on Tuesday at 7.30pm. Kelly has also recorded a new series of hit ITV1 entertainment show Stars in Their Eyes, but this is not due to be broadcast for several months. An ITV spokeswoman said no decision had been taken yet and declined to comment further. Kelly tonight \"emphatically denied\" the sex allegations made against him in a statement released on his behalf by London-based law firm Kingsley Napley. But ITV insiders admit they will have to take a decision soon about whether to allow the Wish You Were Here report featuring Kelly to go ahead. \"This is much more like the considered decision we had to make about [Michael] Barrymore than the one on John Leslie, who was due on air next day for two hours\" an ITV source said. \"We haven't got to make decisions right now, although we will have to think about what to do with Wish You Were Here,\" the insider added. This Morning presenter Leslie was taken off air by producer Granada the day that allegations about his sex life were first made public back in October. Leslie's contract with Granada was terminated a week later, after he failed to respond to an avalanche of press reports. ITV decided to keep Michael Barrymore's series, Kids Say The Funniest Things, on the shelf after a man was found dead in his swimming pool in March 2001. But the broadcaster held off from making a decision about Barrymore's ITV contract until after the conclusion of an inquest into the death in September last year. ITV even attempted to resurrect Barrymore's career in early 2002, putting out a new series of his show My Kind Of People, which attracted disappointing ratings. The inquest eventually returned an open verdict, but after the torrent of negative press it provoked about Barrymore, ITV said it would not be renewing his contract."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
