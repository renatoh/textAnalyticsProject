It\u2019s more than the rub of the green. It represents the feeling that the big bad wolf, no matter the plan you hatch, the traps you set and the amount you\u2019re prepared to struggle against fate, will eventually get his dinner. It\u2019s about the inevitability of Bayern Munich always, in the final analysis, coming out on top. Saturday was not an afternoon to leave the Bundesliga glossary open at that page. After Bayer Leverkusen left the Allianz Arena with a wholly unexpected win courtesy of Leon Bailey\u2019s excellent double strike, the visitors didn\u2019t struggle to find an explanation for how they had weathered a genuine deluge of second-half pressure from the irritated home side. \u201cWe were lucky,\u201d coach Peter Bosz told Sky. \u201cThat\u2019s what was missing last week (in a 1-1 draw with Freiburg). \u201cThe first 30 minutes were really good, when we put them under pressure and scored the goal, but afterwards we left spaces that were far too big (to leave) against a team like Bayern. So we were lucky.\u201d His livewire forward Kevin Volland, who laid on both of Bailey\u2019s goals that won the day, was just as blunt. \u201cIn the second half, of course, we were lucky,\u201d he said. He even \u2013 as S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung\u2019s Thomas Gr\u00f6bner pointed out \u2013 used the very word, Dusel, to describe what had guided his team to the finish line. \u201cOnly with luck can one win in Munich,\u201d as defender Sven Bender put it. Lukas Hradecky, who pulled off a string of great saves including a jaw-dropping double stop from Robert Lewandowski and Thomas M\u00fcller, deserved his fair share of it. The Finnish goalkeeper lost a contact lens in the first half and \u201ccould hardly see anything for the last 20 minutes of it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou trying playing against Bayern with one eye.\u201d He was outstanding, every bit the player that persuaded the club to cash in on Bernd Leno in 2018 when they brought him in on a free from Eintracht Frankfurt. Hradecky\u2019s excellence was enough that Bayern were never going to jump to doomy conclusions after their first misstep under Hansi Flick. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much missing,\u201d suggested Hradecky\u2019s opposite number Manuel Neuer, while M\u00fcller \u2013 whose goal that briefly bought Bayern first-half parity was his first after 21 scoreless games \u2013 talked of Leverkusen\u2019s \u201cefficiency.\u201d Karl-Heinz Rummenigge boldly trumpeted his support for Flick and pledged that, at the winter break, the parties might sit down and thrash out a longer-term arrangement. Yet this was no act of God. Bosz expanded on the performance to praise Leverkusen\u2019s \u201ccharacter and mentality\u201d, which has not always matched their craft. This was a team of talent showing their desire, and none more so than Bailey. He had shone so brightly on his 2018 entry into the first team that a big-money move to Chelsea, Bayern (post-Rib\u00e9ry and Robben) or elsewhere had been considered an inevitability, before he hit the wall. Bosz\u2019s predecessor Heiko Herrlich criticised Bailey\u2019s lack of focus and had turfed him out of the XI. Before Saturday he hadn\u2019t played in the Bundesliga for nearly a month, after being brought on to try and save the game against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach and being swiftly sent off for an awful challenge on Patrick Hermann. But here, Bailey was at his best \u2013 direct, dangerous and deadly. After each of his two finishes he celebrated with an air of defiance, but opened up after the game. \u201cYou doubt yourself,\u201d he admitted, \u201cbut there were people around me who supported me and it did me good to help the team with my comeback.\u201d That sort of honesty and application \u2013 just like young French winger Moussa Diaby filling in at left-back during the late siege \u2013 will turn Bosz\u2019s team from interesting into insistent. Talking points \u2022 It was eat or be eaten for Lucien Favre in Dortmund\u2019s trip to Hertha after a poor run, worsened by the controversy of Jadon Sancho\u2019s dropping to the bench for the Champions League clash in Barcelona for lateness. Sancho was reprieved here, starting the match \u2013 and accordingly so was Favre, as the English teenager scored the opener. What most impressed the Dortmund brass, though, was their team\u2019s resolve after Hertha, in J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann\u2019s first game as coach, pulled the score back to 2-1 and gained a man advantage when Mats Hummels was sent off for a second booking before half-time. \u201cThe most important thing,\u201d said sporting director Michael Zorc, \u201c(was that) we saw a real team on the pitch, which played and worked for each other. It\u2019s been weeks since the team looked like a team.\u201d \u2022 Hertha, meanwhile, were buoyed by their own performance, and the arrival of Klinsmann on the bench as given the club a much-needed sprinkling of glamour \u2013 the scrum of photographers around the bench, with the new boss doing his own selfie too, was a rare sight for the Olympiastadion. Klinsmann has a lot on his plate though; so much so that he failed to notice YouTuber Marvin W had smuggled himself into Sunday\u2019s training session, before assistant Henrik Kuchno spotted him and had him thrown out. \u2022 RB Leipzig briefly took led the Bundesliga after a win at Paderborn but it is Gladbach that remain the league\u2019s great entertainers, and they retook top spot by beating Freiburg 4-2 on Sunday with Breel Embolo running the show. The Swiss striker scored twice, had one disallowed, missed a penalty and laid on the third for Hermann. It all adds up to their best start since the 1976/77 title win, with Bayern up next Saturday. \u201cWe allowed too much out wide and from dead balls,\u201d noted goalkeeper Yann Sommer, so Embolo and Marcus Thuram might have to weigh in heavily for Die Fohlen to prevail against the champs. \u2022 It was a good weekend too for Schalke, who faced Union on Friday night knowing a 4-0 win would have taken them to the top of the table, albeit temporarily, for the first time since April 2010. They got the win in the end thanks to a beautifully constructed late winner by Suat Serdar, underlining the team\u2019s growth under David Wagner. The match was also significant for the first public appearance of disgraced chairman Clemens T\u00f6nnies this season, back in the stand after his insufficiently long ban for using racist language. \u2022 Sometimes, it just takes a moment when it all clicks and after over two months and eight games without a win, Leonardo Bittencourt\u2019s plunging header did that for Werder Bremen, to give them a lead at Wolfsburg. \u201cWith Leo\u2019s goal,\u201d coach Florian Kohfeldt told Sky, \u201cit all came together.\u201d There was an equaliser for Die W\u00f6lfe by William to make it 2-2 but Werder were sufficiently galvanised to chase a winner. They got it through a sublime Milot Rashica goal, which sparked big celebrations and pulled them away from the danger zone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
