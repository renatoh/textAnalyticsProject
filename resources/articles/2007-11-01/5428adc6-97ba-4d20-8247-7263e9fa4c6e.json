Brian Gilbertson, then chief executive of BHP, recommended to his board four years ago that the world's largest diversified miner should join forces with Rio but the idea was vetoed and Mr Gilbertson left soon after. One of the surprises about the latest move has been that Marius Kloppers has proceeded so quickly with the takeover plan. He has only been in the top job for a matter of weeks, having taken over from Mr Gilbertson's successor, Chip Goodyear, on October 1. The sector has been gripped by mergers amid a commodity boom. Rio Tinto itself bought Alcan of Canada for $38bn (\u00a318bn) this year and the Anglo-Swiss group Xstrata swallowed Falconbridge for $4.5bn last year. Rusal and Sual - both of Russia - merged with Glencore to create the world's biggest aluminium group and Freeport-McMoran Copper &amp; Gold bought Phelps Dodge Corporation for $25.9bn to create the world's largest stock-listed copper company. Equity analysts, particularly at Citigroup, have been arguing for some time that a merger between BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto should be considered again. Clarke Wilkins at Citigroup argued that it made sense for BHP to bulk up and buy what was perceived as a considerably undervalued Rio \"given synergies and nationalistic control issues with Australian assets\". BHP and Rio, powerhouses of the London Stock Exchange, both have dual company structures - with headquarters in Australia and Britain. That satisfies Australian political pride and could help win round regulators, but makes a tie-up operationally more complex. Not everyone agrees with Citigroup that the two companies make obvious stablemates. Charles Kernot, a mining analyst at Seymour Pierce, argued yesterday that a tie-up \"did not make much sense\" for a variety of reasons, not least the regulatory ones. He fears a BHP bid being made at a premium but the necessary disposals made at a discount. Despite insistence from BHP that the competition issues can be handled through a series of careful disposals, Mr Kernot is convinced that US and European Union regulators would crawl all over such a deal and the Chinese would be horrified. Iron ore will be at the centre of any political arguments because BHP and Rio are two of the three biggest producers (along with Companhia Vale do Rio Doce of Brazil) and so vital to the steel-making industry and China's industrial revolution. Some commodity analysts have predicted that ore prices - already at very high levels - could surge a further 50% over the next 12 months. The specialist mining website MineWeb ran a story this week under the headline \"iron ore gold rush\" highlighting how one smaller miner, Australian Resources, witnessed a 15% rise in its share price on Wednesday after saying it planned to focus entirely on iron ore. But it is not just iron ore that matters to BHP. The company has a huge involvement in the uranium market at a time when these prices have also shot up, triggered by a resurgence in the building of nuclear power stations. BHP and Rio are also both big producers of copper and the kind of coking coal that is needed to fire blast furnaces. BHP's move on Rio is the latest in a rush of consolidation in the mining sector driven by the commodity boom that was triggered by increasing demand from China but now also includes India and other Asian nations. In August, BHP reported a 21% increase in its annual pre-tax profits to $18bn as the company benefited from record prices for several of its products. The stainless steel materials division soared 310% on the back of a spike in nickel prices and the company said it expected 10% growth in the Chinese economy over the next year. The strength of the boom has spurred the Shanghai stock exchange to new heights while New York and London have been badly hit by fallout from the sub-prime lending crisis. PetroChina became the first trillion-dollar company this week when it launched an initial public offering in Shanghai but there have been repeated warnings from financial figures that the Chinese stock market is vastly overvalued. And critics fear that if the bubble did burst, the impact on mining companies would be extensive. China accounts for 20% of BHP's sales and the success of any acquisition of Rio largely depends on demand remaining strong."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
