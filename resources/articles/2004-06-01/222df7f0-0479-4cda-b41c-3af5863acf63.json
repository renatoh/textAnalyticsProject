Yes, the gales have been countrywide but Beckenham has been waiting 50 years for this match. The only other occasion a first-class game was staged here, in its former guise as the Lloyd's Bank Ground, was in 1954 against Gloucestershire and that was weather-affected too. Why, even such a hardy soul as umpire Peter Willey, whose tough-as-teak reputation precedes him, telephoned Lord's on Wednesday to ask whether high winds could be considered a play-halting factor. \"No,\" was the reply. \"Get out there and get on with it.\" Thankfully, rain intervened but not yesterday as Warwickshire won their seventh toss out of nine and naturally opted to bat on a good-looking pitch which afforded bounce and some pace, although the slippery Mohammad Sami disappointed with 14 no-balls and a warning for running on the pitch. This is, of course, a top-of-the-table clash, which meant there was no reason to expect too much frivolity, but the grimness of the attrition was still a little surprising. There was not a boundary until the 12th over and that was an involuntary edge through second slip. The grateful beneficiary was Powell, in only his second championship match of the summer. To think he was captain last season and for the two before that. Here he was hell bent on making the most of the unexpected opportunity afforded by the hand injury to his successor Nick Knight, who has finally conceded that the pain suffered from a Nantie Hayward delivery three weeks ago during his career-best 303 is from a broken bone. Matthew Walker was the culprit at slip when Powell had only eight and again when the opener had 35 but on Powell ploughed in a doughty display of self-denial and application, eschewing all risk and mainly dealing in his favoured leg-side clips. He was 34 at lunch, 76 at tea and just before 5.30pm reached his hundred off 263 balls in five hours. His relief was palpable and, after the customary helmet-off, bat-waving celebrations, was manifested by a meaty thump of his pads. \"I'm back,\" it said. Mark Wagh and Jonathan Trott played much more attractively and fluently but Wagh became Kent's sole success when he succumbed to a leg trap of which Douglas Jardine would have been proud, paddling straight into the hands of deep leg-gully, one of five leg-side fielders. Powell and Trott resume this morning, Powell eyeing his championship best of 145 and Trott on the threshold of a first century of the summer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
