But those who sang the piece first in the Jewish orphanage in Prague and then in the ghetto camp of Theresienstadt (Terez\u00edn), knew perfectly well that the bully represented Hitler. The message that he could be defeated was symbolic: performing together brought hope and made them feel human, yet most of those children went to their deaths in Auschwitz not long after, as did Kr\u00e1sa himself. Forming an emotional postlude to Welsh National Opera\u2019s Freedom season and the theme of human rights, the innocent brightness of the WNO children\u2019s chorus, the shining commitment and talent of the two youngsters, Manon Thomas and Alfie Jones, as Aninku and Pepi\u010dek, who sing to get money to buy milk for their ailing mother, came over vividly. It was all the more moving for clearly being a promise fulfilled by WNO\u2019s music director, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Hanus. His mother, Anna Hanusova-Flachova, was one of those who sang it in Terez\u00edn. She survived thanks to an administrative error. Kr\u00e1sa\u2019s music is uncomplicatedly tuneful, direct and appealing: Hanus conducted with passion, his own children joining in a reprise of the final rousing chorus. There was a colourful immediacy to David Pountney\u2019s staging, but this was no cocooned-in-cotton-wool affair. The audience had filed in past metal railings wound with barbed wire, each member given a yellow scarf by a Nazi guard. Sharp toots of his whistle brought the children marching in. Steffan Lloyd Owen as Brundib\u00e1r was a suitably pantomimic villain, and the rest of the young cast were equally adept. The brief opera was reinforced by a short documentary using footage of the propaganda film shot at Terez\u00edn, with Hanus\u2019s own account linking us to the present. Last came testimony in person from 90-year-old Ellen Davis who, separated from her family, left Germany on Kindertransport. Her heartfelt appeal was quietly delivered: \u201cThis is happening again, do something to stop it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
