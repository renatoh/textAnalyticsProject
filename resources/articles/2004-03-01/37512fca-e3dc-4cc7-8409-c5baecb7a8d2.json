Football's international federation will accept all Wada's strictures on the fight against drugs in sport except the core insistence on a minimum two-year ban for doping cheats. Sepp Blatter, the president, said after yesterday's executive meeting in London that a formal signing ceremony would take place in Paris on May 21 in the presence of Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympic Committee. The terms under which Fifa will be signing up to Wada - in time to ensure football's presence at the Athens Olympics - may upset other sports which have accepted a minimum two-year suspension for doping offenders. Blatter said: \"The Wada code allows, in exceptional cases, for individual assessment of a case. Now we have convinced Wada that all football doping cases can be considered exceptional as the word is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary. \"Of course we have to fight doping but it's not possible to put everything into the same parcel. Everyone must receive correct treatment under the law. To do otherwise would not be correct from a human-rights standpoint.\" The law-making international board has scrapped the golden goal and silver goal to resolve drawn matches and reverted to full extra-time and penalties. Despite opposition from the Football Association and England's coach Sven-Goran Eriksson, it is limiting to six the number of substitutions possible for friendly matches. The decisions come into effect in July."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
