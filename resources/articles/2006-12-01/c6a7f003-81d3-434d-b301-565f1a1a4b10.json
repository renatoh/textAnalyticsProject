Terry has missed Chelsea's last three Barclays Premiership matches, in which they have conceded six goals and fallen four points leaders Manchester United. At the weekend Jose Mourinho admitted he had 'no idea' when his captain would be back from injury, or whether he would even need surgery. But a Chelsea statement this afternoon confirmed that Terry had gone under the knife in France. \"Chelsea Football Club can confirm that today club captain John Terry underwent successful surgery following his back injury,\" read the statement. \"The operation took place in France following consultation between the Chelsea medical department and a leading neurosurgical specialist. The operation to remove a sequestrated lumbar intervertebral disc was successful and everyone at the club wishes John a speedy and full recovery.\" That would be welcome news for manager Jose Mourinho, whose side have now let in 15 goals - only seven fewer than they did over the whole of the last Premiership season. Having sold both William Gallas and Robert Huth, over the summer, Mourinho recently claimed that his squad was too light at centre back, leading to heavy speculation that he would invest in new players during the January transfer window. Manchester City's Micah Richards and Birmingham's Matthew Upson have both been linked with a move to a club, and Mourinho has even considered asking 19-goal striker Didier Drogba to step into the role on an emergency basis. \"I do not like to play at centre-back,\" said Drogba. \"But I do it for the team because sometimes we have difficult moments in the game.\" England fans, however, will be more anxious to know whether Terry will be fit to lead his country in their first international of 2007, against Spain at Old Trafford on February 7."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
