They claim a \u201cmedia blitz\u201d is about to start that will see Johnson become much more visible with four weeks to go until he potentially enters No 10 as prime minister. On Monday night the BBC broadcast his first TV interview of his campaign, although many of his answers to Laura Kuenssberg were the same as those he gave to similar questions at his launch four weeks ago. He will attend at least five campaign events in London and Surrey on Tuesday, including an afternoon tea, door-knocking and a speech to 200 members at a horticultural society. But will the general media be allowed to come along? It is not an open invitation. Johnson\u2019s tactic throughout the contest so far has been to keep out of the spotlight, reducing the risk of slip-ups. Instead of submitting himself to questions from journalists, proxies such as Priti Patel and Liz Truss have been dispatched to make the case for his Brexit policy for him, preventing the embarrassment of being directly asked questions about his character and instances where he has fallen short of the truth. The strategy is for the entire focus to be on his pledge to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October, pitching him as tougher on this issue than Jeremy Hunt to the highly Eurosceptic Tory selectorate. There will be something of a shift now towards Johnson appearing more in the public eye, with stage-managed events and photo opportunities, now that he needs to cement his lead with the 160,000 Conservative members who make the final choice. However, the campaign\u2019s tactics of keeping Johnson on a tight leash remain unchanged, especially since the Guardian\u2019s revelation that the police were called to a loud late-night altercation between him and his partner, Carrie Symonds, last week. Police were called to the flat they share by concerned neighbours, but left after being reassured both individuals were safe. A mysterious photograph of Johnson sitting at a garden table in the Sussex countryside next to his smiling girlfriend emerged on Monday, which his campaign team deny was set up and released by them. But so far, he has refused to comment on the incident itself, saying party members do not want to know about \u201cthat sort of thing\u201d. While the campaign is keen to address Hunt\u2019s accusation that Johnson is a \u201cbottler\u201d afraid of being grilled by hostile journalists, there is an overriding desire to prevent further furores that could erode his commanding lead over the next four weeks. One veteran Conservative strategist who has worked on several past leadership campaigns said Johnson\u2019s low-profile strategy \u2013 advised unofficially by election guru Lynton Crosby \u2013 was the right one if he wanted to ensure he got to No 10. \u201cThere is no perfect formula but as a rule of thumb, if you\u2019re the frontrunner, you minimise the risks,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy would you take risks if you are leading \u2013 in Boris\u2019s case by the best part of two to one with the voters? The electorate of 160,000 are split mostly in favour of a no-deal Brexit so in this situation he needs to not drop the ball. Or as Tony Blair once described it, \u2018take the Ming vase across the marble floor\u2019.\u201d He said the only moment when Johnson might have to emerge more comprehensively was if polling told him he was obviously losing ground to Hunt with Tory members \u2013 but that stage had not yet been reached. Johnson\u2019s supporters are defensive about his keeping away from scrutiny and insist 16 hustings across the country with members constitutes a huge amount of openness, as well as an ITV head-to-head debate scheduled for next week. Eddie Hughes, a Conservative MP supporting Johnson for the leadership, said it was \u201ctoo early for people to judge his level of engagement\u201d, and it was clear that he would do set-piece interviews and debates as the contest went on. But Hunt\u2019s team have sensed weakness in this area, branding his opponent a \u201ccoward\u201d over Johnson\u2019s newfound camera-shyness. Their strategy is the exact opposite: trying to gain maximum exposure for their candidate in the hope that Conservative members will get the jitters about Johnson and see their man as a safer, more sensible alternative. Steve Brine, a Conservative MP and one of Hunt\u2019s campaign organisers, said it benefited the foreign secretary to debate alongside Johnson as much as possible. \u201cThe first hustings event on the weekend was an eye-opener for many but I don\u2019t think it was for many MPs,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was Boris Johnson doing what he does, although even I was surprised he asked the interviewer how long was left. And it was Jeremy Hunt doing what he does, showing clearly why we say he\u2019s a sharp, focused and match-fit candidate ready to step up into the top job next month.\u201d Hunt has trodden a careful line of refusing to criticise Johnson\u2019s personal life while still managing to cast some aspersions on his character by hinting that his rival is not brave enough to answer questions. At the same time, some of his supporters are going further towards direct attacks on Johnson, with allies having told the Sunday Times that Johnson\u2019s complicated personal life could be a security risk. Ryan Shorthouse, of the Bright Blue thinktank and pressure group for liberal conservatism, said the race between the two men had inevitably become \u201ca contest about character\u201d as they had such different personalities, whereas there was less difference in their policies. \u201cEither the Tory party believes better and further negotiation with the EU is required, which will require a detail-orientated diplomat. Or the Tory party is convinced that Brexit can only be cracked through an election, which will require a colourful, charismatic campaigner.\u201d Johnson has stressed he does not want an election. But his chances of entering No 10 increase if the MPs and members think their leader will have to face Jeremy Corbyn and Nigel Farage in the not too distant future \u2013 and if he can demonstrate the discipline to get through a campaign without further gaffes and own goals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
