High pressure systems from the Azores remained stuck for almost the entire year, leading to clear skies and dire shortages of rain. Kent was hit especially hard: the countryside turned into a parched yellow landscape and Margate was hit worst of all, where a mere 236mm (9.29in) rain fell over the whole year, a record for the lowest ever annual rainfall anywhere in the UK. The heat and drought continued throughout September 1921 when TS Eliot went to stay in Margate for three weeks to recuperate from illness. There he wrote his poem The Waste Land, sitting on a Victorian shelter on the promenade looking out on the sands of Margate beach. Although the poem has been widely interpreted as a reflection on the first world war, the extraordinary heat that autumn may also have been an inspiration, and in one section of the poem the narrator is in a summer drought that has transformed the land into a desert. The Waste Land also secured Eliot's reputation as the leading poet of his time, paving the way for his Nobel Prize in 1948. As for the weather for the rest of that autumn, October carried on as if summer had never ended, thanks to persistent anti-cyclones. It was the sunniest October on record and crowds flocked to the seaside in temperatures hitting the high 20s, peaking at an extraordinary 29C on 5 and 6 October in London."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
