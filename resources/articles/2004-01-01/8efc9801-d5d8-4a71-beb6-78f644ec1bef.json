Herman van Holsbeeck, who takes over as the Brussels club's general manager today, was responding to speculation in Belgium that United had offered \u20ac14m for Kompany. \"If that's the offer, I think he will stay,\" Van Holsbeeck said. \"He is only 17 and we are trying to have a new policy at Anderlecht, showing young players they can make a career here. If we sell Kompany after only six months, then that policy will look like nothing.\" Kompany, despite his tender years and inexperience, has been outstanding for Anderlecht in this, his first full season, and the interest in him - from Arsenal as well in England - prompted Anderlecht to improve his contract in October. He is contracted to the club until 2006. Kompany has been called up by Belgium already and is being compared to Marcel Desailly in terms of technique and temperament. Meanwhile United's affiliated club in Belgium, Royal Antwerp, went into their league's winter break second bottom and relegation is a real prospect. It is a fate both clubs want to avoid given the standard below the top division. United have sent players such as Ronnie Wallwork and Danny Higginbotham to Antwerp to gain experience. Antwerp have already gone through two managers this season as they have fallen down the table and their predicament has prompted two club officials to visit United this week. The president Eddy Wauters and secretary Paul Bistiaux have been in Manchester discussing Antwerp's situation and it has been said in Belgium that United briefly mentioned the possibility of Rio Ferdinand going there during his ban. Uefa, however, would object to such a proposal. Antwerp postponed Tuesday's scheduled announcement on a manager, with the vice-president Karel Vertongen saying \"there is a possibility we can get a coach from Manchester United. All the other candidates for the job as coach will have to be patient.\" Brian McClair, whose name has been mentioned, is among the coaches at Old Trafford."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
