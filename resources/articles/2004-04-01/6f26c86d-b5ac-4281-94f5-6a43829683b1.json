The scoreboard revealed overall state aid in the EU fell \u20ac1bn to \u20ac49bn, continuing the downward trend from a high of \u20ac67bn in 1997. Aid has been falling by an average of \u20ac1bn a year since 1999. As a percentage of GDP, Denmark granted the highest level of aid, at 0.72%, whilst the UK, Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands made grants worth 0.2%. Germany, Spain and Portugal made grants worth 0.55%. The figures confirm the competition commission's success in persuading EU member states both to grant less aid, and to divert cash away from sectoral projects into horizontal projects - namely schemes designed to improve free trade, such as investing in R&amp;D, environmental projects, rural development and SMEs. Horizontal expenditure now accounts for 73% of all state aid, an increase of 7% on the 1998-2000 average, with Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Austria and Finland awarding almost all aid in 2002 to horizontal projects. Of the 27% spent on sectoral projects, manufacturing, coal and financial services continued to benefit most. Competition commissioner Mario Monti claimed his department was responsible for the lowering of state aid levels, and argued it had ensured money was now being spent more effectively. \"The commission continues to ensure an economically sound control of state aid throughout the union,\" he said. \"This is because state aid that is not a part of a coherent EU wide policy will frustrate free competition and prevent the most efficient allocation of resources.\" Mr Monti warned that \"a national subsidy race remains one of the most serious threats to the unity of the common market\". Aid to the EU's poorest regions continues to fall. From a high of \u20ac28bn in 1993, aid to these regions received to \u20ac9bn in 2000, and \u20ac8bn in 2002. The reduction is primarily due to a sharp reduction in regional aid in Germany, a trend partially offset by increases in France, Spain and Italy. Grants continue to be the most popular instrument of subsidy, making 60% of the EU total. Aid paid is still paid through national budgets and through national social security systems. EU wide, 24% of aid was granted through tax exemptions, with Portugal, 78%, Ireland, 67%, and Germany, 38% making the greatest use. Most state aid granted to private companies is excluded from the subsidy scoreboard, as it does not meet the four criteria laid down in Article 87 (1) of the Maastricht Treaty.
