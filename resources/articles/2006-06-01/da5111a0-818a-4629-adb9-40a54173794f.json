She threw a glass of water over Susie, effectively showing that her bitchy reputation is well deserved. So the two faced Grace has gone. Midweek, the bookies had stopped taking bets on her eviction after an overwhelming number were placed. When Davina made the announcement, Grace didn't look in the least bit surprised (given the baying for her blood from the crowd last week it couldn't have been a shock). Knowing that she was unlikely to get a cheer anyway, Grace lived up to her nasty reputation by throwing a glass of water over Susie. This prompted angry cries from some of the housemates including Aisleyne who called her a bitch (ooh perceptive). By this action she caused an argument between the groups in the house with accusations of a conspiracy being flung about. The drama, already being called 'Watergate', (see what they did there?) only goes to show what a great housemate Grace has been. Over the past few weeks, Grace has bitched, stirred and generally spent most of her time screwing up her face and moaning about anyone who is not as great as her fine self. As much as the public hate displays of arrogance and snobbery, she provided much needed controversy in the house. She was a pantomime villain to Pete's unlikely hero and there seems to be no one else left in the house to fill her Machiavellian (Ugg) boots. Her greatest moments came in the last week when she learnt Susie had nominated her. Although assuring Susie that she was fine about it, she soon came up with plans for revenge. These were admittedly limited, stealing Susie's champagne? Er, Susie doesn't drink. Dressing up in shiny gold? Just makes you look like a stripper. All these childish pranks clearly made viewers vote for her in their droves, but what fun to watch. Funnily enough, Grace complained frequently that she couldn't understand why the public would hate her, showing a scary shortage of self-awareness and a total lack of understanding about video cameras. Grace will be going off to D list notoriety tonight. The boos and hissing from the crowd as she left not only symbolise the strong emotions people feel for the housemates, but also prove that BB has lost a great player from it's troupe. As nasty as Grace was to just about everyone in the house, she was interesting to watch. Her manipulation of others around her had me swearing at the TV and grinding my teeth in frustration. The ability to aggravate and offend are great qualities to have in a housemate and BB will be poorer for her leaving. So the public are probably glad to see the back of Grace, but will her absence leave BB without their much needed token villain?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
