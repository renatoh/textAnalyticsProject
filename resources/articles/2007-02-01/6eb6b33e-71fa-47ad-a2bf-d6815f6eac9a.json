What does he mean? I always wear a clean shirt, and a suit and tie for meetings. Could he possibly be referring to my dreadlocks and tattoos? Why can't I be smart enough for work and still wear my piercings? The worker's view Clare Utting, agent's assistant You don't say what sort of office you work in and where your tattoos are. Surely, unless you have them on your face, neck or hands a long-sleeved shirt is going to keep them covered. Although you may view yourself as being unconventional and believe that you are expressing your individuality, each workplace has a different set of expectations. I work in the music industry, and what may be acceptable here may not go down quite as well elsewhere. It is all about fitting in. If I wore a suit to the office it would be more unsettling for my boss than if I turned up in jeans. However, if your boss employed you knowing that you had dreadlocks, tattoos and piercings then it is unfair for him to take exception to them now. The etiquette expert's view Rachel Holland is the founder of Rachel Holland Associates (01985 851005) www.rha-manners.co.uk It's not what you wear, but how you wear it. Are your smart clothes tired, worn and crumpled - or crisp, pressed and fresh? You need enough clothes to rotate your outfits, and to make sure that your suit is looking its best. With long hair, particularly weaves or dreadlocks, you must pay extra attention to cleanliness. Your appearance shows your personality and that should be encouraged, but if you have a front-of-house role, you might find that you are out of step with your company's image. Your boss needs to clarify his criticisms. It might be valuable to have an office discussion, so that your dress code is suitable to the industry you work in."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
