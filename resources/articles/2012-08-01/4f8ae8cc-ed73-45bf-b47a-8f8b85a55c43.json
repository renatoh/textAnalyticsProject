Weather forecasters often tell us that temperatures are above or below normal for the time of year, or that we've had more or less rainfall than average, but what exactly is average or normal? Here in the UK the Meteorological Office calculates the average climate over a three decade period to define what \"normal\" is. The current set of 30-year averages are based on the weather from 1971 to 2000, but last week the Met Office released the next set of 30-year averages, covering 1981 to 2010, so \"normal\" has just changed. The new normals provide monthly, seasonal and annual averages for many aspects of our weather, including maximum and minimum temperatures, number of frost days, sunshine hours and rainfall. Anyone can go to the Met Office website and look up averages for the entire UK, or individual weather stations, or regions of the UK. Or better still, you can view the data on beautiful coloured maps. Perhaps it is no surprise that \"normal\" is a little warmer than it used to be. Average annual, seasonal and monthly temperatures for the UK have crept up by a few tenths of a degree each decade, since the 1961 to 1990 period. Ironically \"normal\" weather is not necessarily what we should expect. These averages are just a statistical measure, which help to put climate trends, such as droughts or heatwaves, into context. UK weather keeps us guessing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
