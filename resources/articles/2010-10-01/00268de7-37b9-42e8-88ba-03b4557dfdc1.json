He was speaking at Kable's Public Sector Online event in London on 4 October 2010, where he told delegates: \"There's a review of marketing spend across departments to look at what campaigns are running. In some places you are getting conflicting campaigns running and going out into the public space.\" Quinn, who is also a member of the government's Efficiency and Reform Group, said the problem could be solved and outlined the government's intentions in relation to the forthcoming Comprehensive Spending Review. \"For government, this spending review is not seen as being less for less, it's about doing things better for less, and it is possible, and online has a substantial part to play in that.\" He advised local authorities and other public sector organisations to use the online tools they have available. \"If you can put a form online rather than by post, you're not just saving the postal costs backwards and forwards, but you're also saving the back office processing,\" Quinn added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
