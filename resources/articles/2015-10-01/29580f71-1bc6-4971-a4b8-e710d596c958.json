The trial of detention centre workers Joshua Kaluvia and Louie Efi finished on 29 September, when the PNG national court sitting on Manus Island heard closing submissions, and Justice Nicholas Kirriwom reserved his decision on the charge of wilful murder faced by both men. But now Kirriwom has taken the extraordinary step of reopening the trial next month to hear more evidence. Sources with knowledge of the case told Guardian Australia the two accused wrote to Kirriwom arguing their constitutional right to a fair trial had been breached because the state-appointed public solicitor running their defence called no witnesses other than them. Kirriwom will reopen the case on 30 November, when the court next sits on Manus Island. It is not known whom the men will call in their defence. Kaluvia and Efi are alleged to have killed 23-year-old Iranian Kurd Barati during the riots in the Australian-run detention centre on Los Negros island, Manus province, in February last year. Over three days of violence between 16 and 18 February 2014, more than 60 people were injured, one man was shot by police, another lost an eye, another had his throat cut and Barati was killed, suffering a heart attack as a result of a catastrophic head injury. Kaluvia is alleged to have hit Barati twice with a piece of wood spiked with nails, while Efi allegedly dropped a large rock on Barati\u2019s head as he lay bleeding at the top of a flight of stairs. Kaluvia and Efi have both denied any involvement. In an interview from Lorengau prison, the pair told Guardian Australia they were not involved in Barati\u2019s death. Kaluvia said he was not even at the detention centre when Barati died, while Efi said he was on \u201cstatic\u201d guard duty that night, and did not see Barati. \u201cWe are being set up,\u201d Kaluvia said. \u201cThey want to convict us so that nobody else, no Australians or New Zealanders who are responsible, have to face justice. We have to take the blame for them because we are [from] PNG.\u201d However, witness statements and police evidence presented before the court named Kaluvia and Efi as attacking Barati. Also tendered to the court was a text message reportedly sent from Kaluvia\u2019s phone to his girlfriend following the riots. The message said: \u201cOn the TV news most of the asylum seekers are dead. We killed them, especially me and my friend.\u201d Kaluvia denied sending the text, saying he did not have his phone after the incident. One of the witnesses to Barati\u2019s death, a fellow Iranian asylum seeker, told the court he had been threatened by friends of the defendants for giving a statement to police, and testifying in the trial. Benham Sateh had to be forcibly brought to court from detention, and initially refused to testify, saying he feared for his life. The arrest and trial of Kaluvia and Efi has been controversial on Manus Island, because of a widespread belief many more people were involved in Barati\u2019s assault and death. All of the witness statements collected by police and tendered to the court say that up to 15 people, including expatriate guards from Australia and New Zealand, were involved in killed Barati. \u201cReza Barati was bleeding very heavily from the injury on head,\u201d one statement said. \u201cI saw Reza Barati was still alive at that time when he was lying on the wire floor. The G4S guards who were chasing him from behind reached him and kicked him [Barati] on his head with their boots. I saw about a total of 13 G4S local officers and two expatriate officers kicked Reza Barati in his head with their boots. He was putting up his hands trying to block the blows from the boots.\u201d Two guards \u2013 one Australian and one New Zealander \u2013 have been named in police reports and in witness statements put before the court. PNG police have unsuccessfully tried to have them returned to PNG for questioning. The Australian government\u2019s inquiry into the riots concluded Barati\u2019s death was \u201ccaused by a brutal beating by several assailants\u201d. Manus provincial police commander Alex N\u2019Drasal said he was frustrated by a culture of impunity for expatriate staff working on the island, who are simply flown out of PNG if they are accused of a crime. \u201cIt is an ongoing concern for me,\u201d Manus Provincial Police Commander Alex N\u2019Drasal told the ABC this week. \u201cI am always frustrated when these things happen.\u201d Australian staff alleged to have been involved in a gang rape of a local Transfield worker were flown off the island the morning after the incident, while two other staff who were involved in a serious car crash, allegedly involving drink-driving, were also repatriated before police could question them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
