Human rights groups argue that, as they face pressure to repatriate Britons detainedin Syria, ministers\u2019 inaction may result in the transfer of UK nationals to Assad\u2019s forces. The legal charity Reprieve says that differing statements from the Foreign Office indicate that the government has diluted its previous opposition to British nationals being prosecuted in Assad-controlled Syria. In April, parliament was told by the then Foreign Office minister Mark Field that, \u201cgiven the regime\u2019s appalling human rights record, we would not view prosecution by the Assad regime as an appropriate means of justice\u201d. However, the Foreign Office recently appeared to offer a changed stance when asked what steps were being taken to stop Britons being transferred to Assad forces. Andrew Murrison, the current minister of state with responsibility for the Middle East , said the UK would work not only with international agencies but also \u201cpartners in the region who can assist in establishing an appropriate pathway to justice within their territory or legal systems\u201d. Last month Assad, who has slowly regained control over most of Syria after a nine-year war that claimed at least 500,000 lives, said foreign nationals detained in Kurdish-held areas would be tried in his regime\u2019s \u201cspecialised courts\u201d as his forces move into the north-east. About 10,000 Isis fighters are being detained by western-backed Kurdish forces in north-east Syria, including 2,000 foreigners and about 30 British men. Thousands more foreign women and their children are also being held there, including scores of UK nationals and at least 60 children. Maya Foa, the director of Reprieve, said it had written to the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, asking him to clarify the UK\u2019s position and what the government believes is \u201can appropriate pathway to justice\u201d. \u201cSending Brits to Assad\u2019s Syria would be effectively sentencing them to torture, disappearance or summary execution \u2013 abuses that are directly opposed to fundamental British values and the law,\u201d said Foa. \u201cYet this government appears unwilling to categorically rule this out as an option. They must do so at once, and begin efforts to repatriate British detainees to the UK where children may be given the support they require and adults may, if appropriate, face justice in British courts.\u201d The UK government\u2019s most recent human rights and democracy report acknowledges reports of \u201cwidespread and systematic use of arbitrary detention, torture and execution of detainees\u201d in Syrian prisons. A Human Rights Watch investigation in 2015 revealed at least 6,700 killings in Syrian detention. Last May human rights lawyers filed war crimes cases against Assad at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. The Foreign Office said the transfer and prosecution of Isis detainees was \u201cultimately a matter for authorities under whose jurisdiction the individuals are detained\u201d. They should \u201cface justice through a fair trial in the most appropriate jurisdiction\u201d. It was concerned that Assad-held parts of Syria authorised the death penalty. \u201cThe UK has significant human rights concerns about trials of Daesh-related suspects in domestic courts of Iraq and regime-held areas of Syria including the use of the death penalty, which the UK opposes in all circumstances, as a matter of principle,\u201d said the FCO. Although the government has repatriated a few British orphans, it has failed to act over the majority of British children and adults in camps over which the Kurdish authorities say their control is declining. \u201cTo ensure the UK does not lose track of British detainees in north-east Syria as a result of their transfer to Assad-controlled forces, the government must act now to repatriate all UK nationals held by Kurdish authorities,\u201d said Foa."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
