Yesterday's win at Everton will add a touch of Wembley glamour to the run-in. STAT OF THE DAY A rare positive for QPR: they have now won back-to-back matches in the league for the first time since April 2011 \u2013 when they were in the Championship. SON OF THE DAY Tom Ince's equaliser against Watford set Blackpool on the way to their first win under his dad, Paul. He better have something good up his sleeve for Mother's Day too, though. OWN GOAL OF THE DAY Villa defender Nathan Baker's effort was a sight to behold, as he reacted to being put under absolutely no pressure at all by slicing Jobi McAnuff's harmless cross past a bewildered Brad Guzan. SCORER OF THE DAY Tranmere's win at home to Oldham came via a goal from Max Power, the man whose name you'd love to touch. But you mustn't touch. Remember kids: there's the right way, the wrong way and the Max Power way. STARE OF THE DAY Crystal Palace's in-house, real-life mascot, Kayla the eagle, giving Leeds manager Neil Warnock a cool reception on his return to Selhurst Park. STERLING EFFORT OF THE DAY In the big Stirling derby, it finished Stirling 9 East Stirling 1. Pedants will point out that East Stirling are from Falkirk so it wasn't really a derby \u2013 but don't spoil the moment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
