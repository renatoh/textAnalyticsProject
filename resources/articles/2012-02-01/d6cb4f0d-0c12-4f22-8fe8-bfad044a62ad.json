Themselves, frequently. They are cranks, comedians, publicity-seekers. Or else they're savvy populists, perhaps disowned by their parties and perceived by voters to have been mistreated. Ken Livingstone running for London mayor in 2000 comes to mind. Lutfur Rahman in Tower Hamlets is a smaller, more recent example. They're the sort who win. Michael Bloomberg, mayor of New York, is an independent, though he didn't win as one first time round: he triumphed as a Republican, having previously been a Democrat to boot. But Siobhan Benita, the ex-civil servant pitching for City Hall in 2012, fits none of these moulds. She seems to be neither an oddball nor an outlaw. She has no track record as a politician and says she has no intention of being one. She's been written about in the Standard and the Guardian. She has a very groovy name. If you saw her interviewed on The Sunday Politics you'll have noticed that she's confident, intelligent and photogenic. So far, so good. But what happens next? To get one of my two mayoral votes, she'd have to tickle my policy fancy in ways the other runners don't. Yet most of her list of key pledges feels very familiar. Reducing road congestion by charging companies who dig up roads is already covered by Boris Johnson. Freezing fares for two years is dilute Ken Livingstone. Making better use of the Thames is an old favourite that somehow never floats. A safer and better cycling network is favoured by everyone. Zero tolerance of graffiti, protecting police numbers, and building homes on surplus GLA land is what they all want, but find easier to say than to do. One novel Benita policy is to appoint a young mayor and a youth assembly, but how would you decide who got the jobs? A better youth focus would be addressing the marginalised and troublesome with an intellectual rigour and moral commitment no London mayor so far has mustered. On The Sunday Politics, Benita told BBC London's political editor Tim Donovan that she's always been a Labour voter and put her cross next to Ken's name in 2008. This doesn't surprise me - her outline programme has a largely mainstream left-of-centre feel. So what could she bring to the contest that would make a real difference to it? Benita says that her civil service experience has taught her how to bring people together and get things done. That doesn't grab me as quite the unique selling point she needs, but maybe there's something to build on there. Before too long the main party candidates will start publishing manifestos of their own. Benita, with her civil servant's, non-party mind would surely have an autonomous, practical critique of all of them - one worth hearing, very likely. Perhaps that's where she could come into her own."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
