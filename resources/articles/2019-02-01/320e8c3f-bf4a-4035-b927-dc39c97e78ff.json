Broke forward and distributed well in early stages. 7 Andy Robertson Overhit a couple of crosses, usually found himself pressed back by Bayern\u2019s wide players. 6 Georginio Wijnaldum Like the rest of Liverpool\u2019s midfield, poise and promise tended to fizzle out higher up the pitch. 7 Jordan Henderson Some incisive passes from rear of midfield, one of which created early chance for Salah. 8 Naby Ke\u00efta Eager to take possession and used the ball intelligently, if not always imaginatively. Not decisive enough with second-half chance to free Robertson. 7 Mohamed Salah Wide with first-half header some great backheels, but ultimately not an unanswerable problem for the Bayern defence. 7 Roberto Firmino Masterful at creating space and danger from unpromising positions, few chances. Not his night. 7 Sadio Man\u00e9 Glaring first-half miss with his back to goal, though he did have the time to turn and take a proper look. 7 Subs James Milner (for Ke\u00efta 76) 5, Divock Origi (for Firmino 76) 5. Not used Daniel Sturridge, Alberto Moreno, Adam Lallana, Simon Mignolet, Xherdan Shaqiri Bayern Munich Manuel Neuer Even more of a spectator than Alisson for the most part, did what he needed to do with usual reliability. 6 Joshua Kimmich Booked for foul on Man\u00e9 in first half, so right-back will be suspended for the second leg. 6 Niklas S\u00fcle Looked susceptible to Liverpool\u2019s pressing at first, perhaps not tested enough by the home front three. 6 Mats Hummels A little cumbersome at times in bringing the ball out, but grew into game and an impressively impassable barrier by the end. 8 David Alaba Strong and purposeful when going forward, not unduly troubled by Salah most of the evening. 6 Javi Mart\u00ednez Midfield kingpin, authoritative and hard working in defence, powerful and committed when going forward. 9 Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara Neat and tidy in the middle, partnership with Mart\u00ednez meant Bayern held their own in midfield. 7 Serge Gnabry Control let him down in Liverpool\u2019s penalty area when Bayern could have taken a first-half lead. Decent shot in second half 7 James Rodr\u00edguez Not bad at taking corners, just a pity he was seldom noticed on the pitch for doing anything else. 6 Kingsley Coman Effective outlet on left, pace and control made for entertaining battle with Alexander-Arnold 7 Robert Lewandowski Surprisingly few touches, never mind chances, given his midfield saw as much of ball as Liverpool\u2019s 6 Subs Franck Rib\u00e9ry (for Coman 82) 5, Renato Sanches (for James 88) n/a, Rafinha (for Gnabry 90) n/a. Not used Alphonso Davies, Sven Ulreich, Lars Mai, Meritan Shabani"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
