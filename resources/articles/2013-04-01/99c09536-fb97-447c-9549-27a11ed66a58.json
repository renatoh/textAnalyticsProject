For them the second-row came back in the nick of time after surgery on a disc to turn an ordinary season into a charge at the Heineken Cup. Against Harlequins away in the quarter-final he was inspired, reigniting his prospects for the Lions tour and his province's dream of a third Heineken title. In the eyes of rugby law, at its supreme court of citation, O'Connell had no case to answer after his rather crude hack at the ball in the recent Munster-Leinster derby made contact with the head of Dave Kearney. The judges' view did not coincide with the view of Clermont's Yellow Army, and 25,000 of them gave O'Connell a right booing when his name was announced before the game. \"This lot,\" said one of the Munster fans that made up the rest of the crowd of 31,259, \"make Thomond Park sound like a tomb\". Somewhere between his state of grace and role as sinner lay O'Connell's reality, a week spent nursing a fresh injury, a tweak to his groin. On the day he put his aching body on the line and, despite neither he nor his team finding top gear, came very close to upsetting the club that the captain acknowledged was \"probably the best in Europe at the moment\". If Munster endured years of heartache before they won the Heineken Cup for the first time in 2006, it was as nothing compared with the frustrations of ASM Clermont Auvergne. Ten times in their history they had been to the French championship final and 10 times they had lost. Then, in their hundredth year in 2010 and under their coach, Vern Cotter, they finally won and the New Zealander set their sights on this, the next grand prize. Last year they lost to Leinster in Bordeaux at the same semi-final stage; this year in Montpellier they promised no repeat of failure. But they started slowly, allowing Munster to drive them back with a maul from a lineout and Ronan O'Gara to stroke over a penalty. Only then did Clermont come to life. O'Connell afterwards recognised the point of ignition: \"You can't afford to give a team so good a leg-up. But that's what we did and from 3-0 up we were suddenly 13-3 down.\" There was not a lot Munster could do when Clermont began their surge. Huge forwards, like the flanker Julien Bardy, combined with huge backs, none more impressive than the Fijian wing, Napolioni Nalaga, with the whole lot of them off-loading among themselves, flicking the ball to support runners cutting at an angle to throw defenders off-balance. Nalaga finished off a sumptuous set of attacks for the first try before Morgan Parra, the little maestro directing the giants' charges from scrum-half, kicked a brace of penalties. Munster have a New Zealander of their own as coach, Rob Penney. He says he is trying to \"push ahead, getting the players to recognise space when it's on\". But for over an hour he had to sit and hope that the old Munster values of never giving up might prevent a hammering. Munster did scramble in defence magnificently, even when Regan King managed what most teams seek to do in running through O'Gara. In general, though, the back row of Peter O'Mahony, Tommy O'Donnell and James Coughlan covered their outside-half's front devotedly. And the hooker Mike Sherry helped out, knocking attackers back or winning a penalty at a ruck close to the Munster line. Clermont were a bit overexcited at times, too, especially their Canadian giant of giants, Jamie Cudmore. If there was a villain among the second-rows it was he, guilty of a little off-the-ball excess. Amazingly at half-time the scoreboard had not shifted beyond 13-3. And even when Parra nudged it to 16-3 the issue was not settled. Suddenly all Penney's work on spatial awareness had its reward, a lineout on one side leading to controlled thrusts in midfield and Denis Hurley's chase of a delicate kick by O'Gara on the other side. The conversion put Munster within a converted try of comeback delirium. Clermont were not so rampant, or even anywhere near composed, now. King broke through again but it was all about Munster's chances, especially after a lineout steal by Donnacha Ryan and a couple of throws in the Clermont 22. They came to nothing and the Yellow Army's singling out of a Munster icon turned to massed adoration of their own, all of them heading for Dublin and their first Heineken Cup final.
