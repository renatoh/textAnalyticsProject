In a shot across the bows of arch-conservative Lech Kaczynski, the commission declared that all member states must abide by EU rules which protect minorities and block the death penalty. Failure to comply could trigger a special process under the Treaty of Nice which deprives errant member states of their voting rights in ministerial meetings. \"We are going to follow the situation very attentively,\" the principal commission spokesman, Jonathan Todd, said yesterday. The commission intervened after Mr Kaczynski, the Law and Justice party candidate, was confirmed as the winner of Sunday's second round in the Polish presidential election with 54% of the vote. Donald Tusk, a more moderate conservative from the pro-market Civic Platform party, won 46% of the vote. The election cleared the way for a strengthened Law and Justice party, headed by the new president's identical twin brother Jaroslaw, to launch formal coalition talks with Civic Platform. The two parties won a conservative majority in parliamentary elections on September 25. European diplomats will be watching the negotiations carefully after the success of the new president, who made his name as mayor of Warsaw. A strongly conservative Catholic, he refused to allow gay pride marches and supports the death penalty. Friso Roscam Abbing, the European commission's justice spokesman, warned the new president he must abide by article 6 of the Treaty of Nice, which says that all member states must protect minority rights and not impose the death penalty. A failure to comply could trigger article 7, which allows the EU to deprive a member state of voting rights. This allows voting rights to be withdrawn if a member state is in \"serious breach\" of its obligations on human rights."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
