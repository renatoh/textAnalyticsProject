Prof Gideon Boas said he was concerned by those questioning the merit of future cases brought in the criminal or civil jurisdiction based on the Pell ruling. \u201cIt would be unfortunate and legally wrong if the message in the community was that the high court\u2019s ruling has weakened the strength of, or point in, bringing such cases to court or making properly founded allegations,\u201d Boas said. \u201cThe risk to this kind of messaging is that victims will give up or not bother coming forward. The bottom line is that the ruling will have little or no effect on civil cases and limited effect on future criminal cases.\u201d He said the Pell case had a set of unique and complex circumstances that would not necessarily be a factor in other jury trials. \u201cHowever, any case with an allegation of abuse that is historical and decades ago will have evidentiary issues, especially in cases with only one surviving complainant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean cases with one complainant are not capable of succeeding going forward.\u201d Boas added that the jurors who convicted Pell should not feel as though they had failed, and that the public should not read the high court decision as a challenge to the sanctity of the jury. \u201cVictoria\u2019s court of appeal upheld the jury decision by a majority, and the high court went the other way,\u201d Boas said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard it said a lot in this case: \u2018how could the jury get it so wrong when the high court decided unanimously it was an unreasonable verdict?\u2019 \u201cMy response is: what\u2019s to say the high court had it right? You had a jury process that functioned, you had a court of appeal that by majority agreed with them, and gave it serious consideration, and a high court who saw it differently. There is no system that is flawless. Some juries will give verdicts that are perverse or unreasonable and, sometimes, so will judges. But victims should know that overturning a jury decision happens rarely.\u201d On Tuesday the high court ordered Pell\u2019s immediate release from prison and quashed his convictions finding the jury, acting rationally on the whole of the evidence, ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to Pell\u2019s guilt. There was \u201cstrong, credible and undispelled\u201d alibi evidence presented at trial, including from the master of ceremonies at the time, Monsignor Charles Portelli, and sacristan Max Potter, that it was Pell\u2019s practice to greet parishioners on the front steps of the cathedral immediately after mass, which would have made it impossible for Pell to be in the sacristy offending, Pell\u2019s defence barrister Bret Walker had told the high court. But what are victims to make of the fact that jurors are told throughout a trial that it is up to them who they believe and whether they accept all, some, or none of the evidence from witnesses? That it was open to them, in other words, to believe the complainant but not in the reliability of other witnesses called. A professor the Queensland University of Technology faculty of Law, Ben Mathews, said it was \u201ca fantastic question that\u2019s really difficult to answer\u201d. \u201cIt gets grey and murky and one thing that helps create this is the this tension in different court conclusions about the indeterminate notion of reasonable doubt,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you have different courts and individuals making judgments about whether reasonable doubt should have been present when that concept isn\u2019t even defined. The reason for that lack of definition in Australia is we put the trust in juries to make the decision.\u201d What happens in the jury room in Australia is secret. Those discussions can never be disclosed, and a juror is breaking the law if they reveal them. Jurors also have their identities protected. Dr Tyrone Kirchengast, a barrister and solicitor of the high court, said the jury process was sacred, but that also meant it was difficult for studies to be done on how jurors come to their decisions or how much weight they gave different aspects of the evidence. \u201cEven after the trial is complete researchers can\u2019t interview them about their decision-making processes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best we have is mock jurors put together to try to study what happens. We should remember that it is only in rare cases where this overturning of a jury verdict occurs, and this is a case of significant notoriety. \u201cI think we have to also understand that justice isn\u2019t perfect and it can\u2019t always be perfect. It\u2019s the case that sometimes innocent people are convicted and guilty people aren\u2019t, and what we strive for in Australia is a system that eliminates errors as far as possible. \u201cBut it\u2019s impossible to think of criminal trials as a process of a perfect case being put to a perfect jury.\u201d He added that trial procedures were being continuously reformed to assist jurors to do their jobs and to lessen chances of error. Prof David Hamer, with the University of Sydney law school, researches the way criminal courts deal with evidence in determining whether to convict or acquit defendants. He said the Pell case was complex and even experts had different readings and views of it and the high court decision. He said while it was true that jurors were told it was up to them to be arbiters of the facts and to decide which evidence they believed, Pell\u2019s barrister had strenuously argued throughout the appeal that prosecutors had never sufficiently challenged evidence from witnesses such as Portelli. With Portelli\u2019s testimony unchallenged, jurors should have given more weight to it, the high court found. The complainant in the case against Pell who made the allegations said in a statement issued on Wednesday that he did not want victims to be disheartened by the decision. \u201cI would like to reassure child sexual abuse survivors that most people recognise the truth when they hear it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know the truth when they look it in the face.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
