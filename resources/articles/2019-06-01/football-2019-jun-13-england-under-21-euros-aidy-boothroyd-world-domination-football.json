Hubris and England head coaches often make an uncomfortable pairing but Boothroyd is outlining an aspiration of the Football Association. On display nearby are the Under-17 and Under-20 World Cups. The aspiration has substance, and the Under-21s aim to add another layer over the next fortnight in Italy and San Marino. England won the two World Cups in 2017, the year Boothroyd and his Under-21s suffered the agony of a penalty shootout defeat by Germany in the Euro semi-finals. The head coach remains determined to increase the trophy collection at St George\u2019s Park and to do so in a style that England fans can identify at every age level. \u201cI daydream a lot [of adding to the World Cup successes] but they\u2019ve gone really,\u201d says the former Watford manager, who has been part of the England set-up since 2014. \u201cI am very much thinking about the next one rather than wallowing in what has gone on before but, yes, that would be lovely. That is what we are aiming to do, but you need a vision of where you want to get to and that is having a legacy in English football of winning things over a period of decades. \u201cWe want to be thought of as the leading team in the world and to do that you have got to be winning consistently. I think there is also a bigger picture for us in the way we want all our teams to play. The average guy or girl who watches football wants to win, but they want their team to play in a way that is attractive and entertains them. That is the world we live in and that is what we try to do.\u201d England have not won the Euro at Under-21 level since 1984. Their latest pursuit of a third title \u2013 Italy have won it five times and Spain four \u2013 starts on Tuesday against France in Cesena. With the three group winners and best runner-up comprising the semi-finalists, the opening game could prove decisive in a section that also includes Romania and Croatia. Boothroyd is well aware the FA\u2019s ambitious target brings no guarantees, but neither does it allow for a comfort zone. \u201cYou would have to be pretty special to be an all-domineering world power so we know that, realistically, that might not happen over a period of time but we have always got to strive to be that,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to push ourselves to a point where we are disappointed if we haven\u2019t gone past where we have been before. \u201cWe can\u2019t wallow in the wins because those trophies out there will go rusty. We need new ones to shine. Now we are expected to do well and I am not afraid of that. It would be lovely to have world domination but I think we have always got to be striving for it. There will be ups and downs. There always are.\u201d Only three players remain in Boothroyd\u2019s squad from England\u2019s last shot at the Euros in 2017 \u2013 Tammy Abraham, Demarai Gray and Angus Gunn \u2013 but several of the group could have been considered for senior duty in the Nations League. He laughs at the suggestion James Maddison, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Phil Foden are off to Italy because of his close connection to Gareth Southgate. \u201cI\u2019m only smiling because I\u2019m thinking about all the players who have gone up and he\u2019s stolen from me,\u201d says Boothroyd. \u201cMy job is to feed players through to the senior team and to help improve our chances at senior level. What we\u2019re expected to do is develop those players who don\u2019t quite get into the senior team to win our own games as well. A winning environment breeds a winning environment. \u201cGareth has dispelled the myth you have to have 100 Premier League games under your belt before you play. That\u2019s never been further from the truth. It was smart thinking and we\u2019re now in a position where we have a group of 2000s in the Under-21 team and players born in 1997 in the senior team. We are very young and with that comes freshness. With the freshness comes a brand of football everyone is excited about.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
