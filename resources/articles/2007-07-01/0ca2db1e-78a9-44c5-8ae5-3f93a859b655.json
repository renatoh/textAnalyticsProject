Se\u00f1or Torres is not given to expressions of strong emotion, but he winced as he did so. In fact, he looked like he was handling a dead rat. Every time you drink a bottle of modern Spanish white wine, be it from Rueda, Pened\u00e9s, Rioja, Navarra or R\u00edas Ba\u00edxas, you should toast the man who brought Iberian blancos into the modern age by introducing temperature-controlled fermentation and stainless-steel vats. 'When I came back from university in France in the late Seventies, everyone was drinking old-fashioned whites,' he added. He's too polite to say it, but by old-fashioned he means oxidised, knackered, kaput. It's taken another quarter of a century, but Spain is finally beginning to emerge as a producer of world-class modern whites. There are still traditional wines on the market, most notably from Rioja, but these days the oxidation is usually deliberate rather than accidental. Spain's reds may be more exciting, but the whites are catching up fast. I've just been involved with the 2007 New Wave Spanish Wine Awards, and of the 109 wines the judges selected, 33 were white. Even if you exclude the Sherries (14 wines), that's still a good strike rate from a country whose whites are rarely talked about. When Torres started to make his first new wave whites, it was the use of French varieties such as Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc that upset the old-timers. This, despite the fact that his ever-reliable Vi\u00f1a Sol (the 2006 is widely available at \u00a34.69) is made from the Cava grape, Parellada. You can still find good examples of both Gallic interlopers - in Navarra, Somontano and Pened\u00e9s for Chardonnay and Rueda for Sauvignon - but these days it's native grapes that are earning the plaudits. The greatest of these is Albari\u00f1o, the star of Galicia, in Spain's cool north-west corner. The qualities of this wonderful grape are hard to describe - somewhere between a Pfalz Riesling and a good Muscadet Sur Lie, perhaps? - but at its best it is the ideal seafood white. I wish a few more producers would switch to screwcaps (cork taint is far more prevalent than it should be in R\u00edas Ba\u00edxas), but that's my only caveat. My current favourites are the textured, nuanced 2006 Terras Gauda, O Rosal, R\u00edas Ba\u00edxas (\u00a310.39, Les Caves de Pyr\u00e8ne, 01483 538 820). Even better is the mature, multi-dimensional 2002 Pazo Se\u00f1orans Selecci\u00f3n A\u00f1ada, R\u00edas Ba\u00edxas (\u00a332, stockists from Liberty Wines, 020 7720 5350), a wine which proves that Albari\u00f1o is capable of greatness. If your budget doesn't stretch that far, try Sainsbury's impressive 2006 Taste the Difference Albari\u00f1o (\u00a35.99), which is a well-chosen introduction to the variety. Which other wines impressed? Apart from Sherry, Rueda did very well with two varieties: Verdejo and Sauvignon Blanc, often in tandem. The tangy 2006 Castillo de Nava Verdejo/Sauvignon Blanc, Rueda (\u00a36.99, stockists from Freixenet DWS, 01344 758 500) is a great example of what Sauvignon can bring to a blend. Another blend, this time from Priorat, combines the best of modern and traditional Spain. The 2005 Mas d'En Compte, Celler Cal Pla (from \u00a315.49, Burridges of Arlington, 01293 530 151; baileyswines.com) is a barrel-fermented cuv\u00e9e of Garnacha Blanca, Xarel-lo, Picapoll and Macabeo, with rich, honeyed intensity, good acidity and lovely oak integration. It's a very powerful wine, showing some of the bottle development that traditionalists still enjoy. But its flavours are unmistakably modern. I've never tasted the wine with him, but something tells me Miguel Torres would enjoy it, too. The legacy of Spanish Sauternes has been buried at last. tim.atkin@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
