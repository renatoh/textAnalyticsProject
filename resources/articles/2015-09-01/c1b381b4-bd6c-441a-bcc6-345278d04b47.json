Rooney is understood to have felt tightness in the back of a leg during United\u2019s last training session. He was then conspicuous by his absence when the squad arrived for their overnight stay at the Lowry Hotel in Salford. United would not explain his absence but there were unconfirmed reports that the England captain would undergo a fitness test on Saturday. The game is at 5.30 that evening. If United\u2019s fears are confirmed, Rooney\u2019s involvement in United\u2019s Champions League tie against PSV Eindhoven on Tuesday will also be in doubt. Marouane Fellaini is one option and United also have Anthony Martial, their new \u00a336m signing, but Van Gaal has talked about easing the teenager in gently."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
