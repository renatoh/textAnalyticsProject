We tell each other that Presbyterians don't like sex standing up as it may lead to dancing. But for the Catholic church, sex has developed into a lifelong obsession and a very serious business. Priests, bishops, popes and Cherie Blair have wrestled with the question that dare not speak its name in high ecclesiastical circles: just why did God have to make the act of procreation so dramatic and thrilling? Did He really have to engage all of the senses in sex? Couldn't he have simply arranged things so that the continuation of the species could have been expedited by an innocent wee kiss or the chaste tug of an earlobe? Surely He's not playing games with us? And lo it has come to pass that, down through the ages, the berobed Vatican sentinels of Catholic morality have warned us of the dangers of sex and all its attendant woes. We, poor children of Rome, were told to beware of the Other\u2026 before we tried a bit and found that it wasn't that bad at all. But just in case we all got carried away, an acute sense of Catholic guilt \u2013 nurtured, polished and handed down from generation to generation \u2013 insinuated itself into the situation and made a mess of things. And if we insisted in pursuing such beastly folly, then our women would be reduced to a life of endless childbearing where there would be only weeping and brushing of teeth. Just what on earth was God playing at? We do all the sacrificing, believing, self-mortification, fasting and abstaining; Dawkins and his legion of the godless get to do all the houghmagandy, as Robert Burns would have put it. But last week, a little shaft of light illuminated this barren landscape when the Catholic church of England and Wales recommended a prayer for couples about to make love. The intentions seem noble enough: to foster a sense of giving and to diminish feelings of self-gratification before the conjugal waltz. The prayer asks God to \"place within us love that truly gives, tenderness that truly unites, self-offering that tells the truth\u2026 loving physical union that welcomes\". It will become very easy to mock and indeed it is not TS Eliot, but it has a certain diaphanous nobility, don't you think? Incredibly, and this is important (pay attention, Mrs Blair), it does not talk about procreation and every act of love being \"open to life\". Is this the first time that a document, bearing the imprimatur of the official Catholic church, has suggested that sex isn't just about making babies? Nor is the prayer for Catholics alone. The words are imbued with ideas of respect, equality, spirituality, generosity and support. The church should unbend a little more and suggest that the government distributes their good sex guide to schools. Of course the words are aimed at a man and a woman in a Christian marriage, but would it be so bad if teenagers with mere sex on their minds were asked to consider them as well, so that as well as throwing condoms and morning-after pills to scared and bewildered children, our government can teach them of respect for themselves and others? In the meantime, incorrigible old papists such as myself can now ditch our previous and somewhat desperate pre-conjugal entreaty: \"For what we are about to receive may we be truly thankful.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
