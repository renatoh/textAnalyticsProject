His strategy appeared to be to show remorse and deference, highlight the changes Facebook had already made and pledge to do more to protect user privacy and prevent foreign interference in elections. However, when it came to the nuts and bolts of Facebook\u2019s business model, the 33-year-old deflected scrutiny through a combination of declared ignorance, amnesia, and world-class public relations spin. Here are five responses that don\u2019t stand up to scrutiny. The existence of shadow profiles Several members of congress asked Zuckerberg about the data Facebook collects about people who aren\u2019t already members of Facebook. These are known as \u201cshadow profiles\u201d and explain why, if you were to sign up for the first time to Facebook right now, it would already know who all your friends are \u2013 thanks to Facebook slurping your friends\u2019 full address book from their phones, photos and other data sources. Firstly, Zuckerberg said he was \u201cnot familiar\u201d with the term \u201cshadow profiles\u201d. Given the widespread media coverage of the phenomenon, led by Violet Blue at ZDNet and Gizmodo\u2019s Kashmir Hill, this seems difficult to believe. Everyone consents to giving Facebook their data Zuckerberg was pushed further on shadow profiles by congressman Ben Luj\u00e1n, who asked whether people who don\u2019t have Facebook accounts can opt out of Facebook\u2019s involuntary data collection. \u201cYou\u2019ve said everyone controls their data, but you\u2019re collecting data on people who are not even Facebook users, who never signed a consent or privacy agreement and you\u2019re collecting their data,\u201d Luj\u00e1n said. This seems like a big problem for Facebook because getting consent to collect data about an individual is part of data protection 101. That\u2019s before we\u2019ve considered whether the consent people give when the sign up to Facebook could be considered \u201cinformed\u201d, since it\u2019s unlikely many people read the 2,700-word data policy. Facebook has plenty of competition When asked by the Republican senator Lindsey Graham to name Facebook\u2019s biggest competitor, Zuckerberg struggled and dodged the question by saying: \u201cThe average American uses eight different apps to communicate with their friends and stay in touch.\u201d What Zuckerberg didn\u2019t mention is that Facebook, with 2.2 billion users, is by far the biggest and that many of the other most popular apps \u2013 WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger \u2013 are also owned by Facebook. Snapchat, Skype, Houseparty and others are picking up the scraps. \u201cYou don\u2019t think you have a monopoly?\u201d asked Graham. \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t feel like that to me,\u201d replied Zuckerberg, to a ripple of laughter. Plenty of academics disagree with that assessment, arguing that Facebook\u2019s dominance and network effect means it skews the marketplace by sucking investment capital and profits away from smaller businesses. Just take a look at how Facebook went after Snapchat. Tracking users\u2019 web browsing behaviour even after they log out Zuckerberg gave a vague response when asked by Senator Roger Wicker whether Facebook can track users after they had logged off from the platform. At first he said he\u2019d get his team to follow up for accuracy\u2019s sake. \u201cI know that people use cookies on the internet and that you can probably coordinate activity between sessions. We do that for a number of reasons, including security and including measuring ads to make sure that the ad experiences are the most effective, which of course people can opt out of.\u201d The Australian internet security blogger Nik Cubrilovic first discovered that Facebook was apparently tracking users\u2019 web browsing after they logged off in 2011. Responding to Cubrilovic, the Facebook engineer Gregg Stefancik confirmed that Facebook has cookies that persist after log-out as a safety measure (to prevent others from trying to access the account). However, in 2014 Facebook started using web browsing data for delivering targeted \u201cinterest-based\u201d advertising \u2013 which explains why you see ads for products you have already been looking at online appear in your Facebook feed. The collection of transaction data When asked whether Facebook\u2019s tools on external websites collected transaction data, Mark said: \u201cI don\u2019t think any of those buttons collect transaction data.\u201d Details on Facebook\u2019s own site about its \u201cpixel\u201d tool appear to directly contradict that statement. Advertisers who want to track which of their Facebook ads make people buy their products can install a small piece of computer code (the pixel) onto their websites and this will tell which Facebook users visit which page of their website, which ones put items in their shopping basket and which ones make a purchase."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
