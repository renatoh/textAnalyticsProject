All entrants must do (admittedly, vastly more difficult than it sounds) is to draw and write a four-page comic designed to run over a double-page spread in the Observer New Review. Our guest judges this year are the playwright, actor and director Patrick Marber and the cartoonist (and a former winner of the prize) Isabel Greenberg. The winner receives a cheque for \u00a31,000 and his or her work will appear in the Observer in print and online. The runner-up will receive \u00a3250 and have their work published online. Several past winners, and even some runners-up, have gone on to land publishing deals, among them Stephen Collins (The Gigantic Beard That Was Evil) and Fumio Obata (Just So Happens). In 2009, Joff Winterhart was runner-up. His funny and sad 2012 graphic novel, Days of the Bagnold Summer, a longer version of his original entry, has now been made into a movie starring Monica Dolan and Rob Brydon that is set for release next year. It\u2019s fair to say, then, that this competition really can make a big difference to the life of an aspiring cartoonist. So why not have a go? What have you got to lose? Entry forms and terms and conditions can be downloaded here. The deadline for entry is Friday 11 October 2019."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
