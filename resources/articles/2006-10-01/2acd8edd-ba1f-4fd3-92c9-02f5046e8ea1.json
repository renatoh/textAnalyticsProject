Erskine-Crum has spent the last five years planning, overseeing and then delivering the \u00a3200m redevelopment of Ascot, which completed its first season of Flat racing 13 days ago. Some aspects of the new grandstand, and in particular the poor viewing facilities at lower levels, have been fiercely criticised, but Erskine-Crum said yesterday that he is confident any outstanding issues will be addressed before his departure. \"One of the reasons that I'm announcing this today is that, having worked on these issues for the last few months, I'm now very confident that they will all be solved in the best possible way,\" Erskine-Crum said. \"Some solutions are ready and some are not quite ready, and we will announce what will be done when everything is in place, which I'm confident now will be later this year.\" When Erskine-Crum arrived at Ascot nearly 13 years ago, he was seen by many as just another ex-Army man who would maintain the track's traditional air of elitism and snobbishness. It soon became clear, though, that he not only wanted to encourage racegoers to visit Ascot, he also hoped to make every one of them feel welcome when they arrived, which had rarely been the case in earlier times. \"There is always something more to do at a racecourse, whether it is finding more sponsors or increasing the number of Group races and so on,\" Erskine-Crum said. \"But 13 years is quite a long time. I am 57 now, and I would really like one more major career challenge.\" The Duke of Devonshire, Ascot's chairman, said that the timing of Erskine-Crum's announcement would \"give our headhunters time to find the right person\", although Janet Walker, Ascot's commercial and finance director, will assume the role on a temporary basis if the search takes longer than anticipated. \"We know that we need someone exceptional,\" he said. \"We've had one of those, and now we need another.\" Ron Cox's tip of the day Now Look Out 2.30 Newbury Trainer Ed McMahon has his horses in good form. He went close to winning a nursery with Aquilegia at Yarmouth on Wednesday, and has a likely sort for this juvenile handicap in Now Look Out. Well backed when making a winning debut, this useful-looking colt seems fairly treated off a mark of 77. With the stalls on the stands side, his rails draw in 18 could prove a distinct advantage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
