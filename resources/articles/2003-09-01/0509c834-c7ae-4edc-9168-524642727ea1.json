But they may have paid the price for their north London landslide with huge slumps in their vote in the home counties. Labour managed to hold off a fresh challenge by the far right British National party in Stoke-on-Trent. Liberal Democrat Michael Cragg took a Poulton North seat at Warrington Borough in a similar trend to that in Brent. But his party lost to Tory Dennis Steadman in the south ward of Hampshire's Fareham Borough - despite a Labour collapse. Liberal Democrats also nose-dived in Hertfordshire's marginal Kings Langley division. A possible explanation of these results could be that their party activists had been diverted to Brent. Liberal Democrats lost another seat to the Tories when they failed to field a candidate to defend their \"safe\" Sutton seat at Bassetlaw District, Nottinghamshire. At Stoke, Labour's Paul Sutton won an independent Abbey Green seat with a 60-vote majority over the BNP which already had a councillor on the authority. The Conservatives narrowly held on at Ketley and Oakengates, Telford and Wrekin council, in a ward where they trailed Labour by nearly 15% in the average vote in May. Analysis of seven comparable results gives a projected nationwide 11.2% Tory lead over Labour. A calculation based of five wards fought both times by all three major parties gives projected figures of Conservatives 42.2%, Labour 30.6%, Lib Dems 22.2%. Including the Brent result would push the Liberal Democrat vote share up by 4% and the Tory lead over Labour up by 1%.
