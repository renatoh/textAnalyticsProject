Rowenna Davis investigates the world of \"playbourers\" who make their living farming gold in World of Warcraft. One of the \"farmers\" Li Hua describes the working conditions: The working conditions are hard. We don't get weekends off and I only have one day free a month. But compared to other jobs it is good. I have no other skills and I enjoy playing sometimes. Do gamers who buy this gold care about these conditions? The one interviewed for the feature didn't seem bothered. I don't think about the workers. I think about the product. Do you think about factory workers when you put on your socks? Perhaps unsurprisingly given the popularity of the game the US seems to be the biggest market for gold farming. Most of our customers are from America but they are all kinds of people \u2013 students, old, young \u2013 people of all ages and careers. I've played WoW on and off since launch and have not yet been tempted to buy virtual gold. But then I'm not trying to keep up with hardcore players who have time to burn. If I was then the temptation would be there and clearly the market is a real and viable. What do you think then? Any WoW players here been tempted to splash out for virtual riches? And if so, why?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
