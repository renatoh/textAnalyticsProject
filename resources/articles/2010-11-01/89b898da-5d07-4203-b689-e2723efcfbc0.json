Naturally, these Tiny Desk Concerts are filmed, with footage then posted to npr.org/music, and made available as free video downloads from iTunes (search \"tiny desk\"). The 93 sessions so far have thrown up many treats, of which Gogol Bordello's performance is certainly one: you'll struggle not to be entertained by the sight of frontman Eugene Hutz rampaging across the desks like the Chuckle Brothers' deranged gypsy-punk sibling. Last week's session by new wave veteran Nick Lowe wasn't quite as raucous. Accompanied only by his own acoustic guitar, Lowe delivers four country-tinged songs in a rich, timeworn voice \u2013 they compare very favourably to Johnny Cash's later work. You can stream or download both the video and audio from n.pr/nprlowe. If you like Lowe's session (which you surely will), then you'll also find plenty to enjoy at songsfromtheshed.com. As the name of his website implies, Somerset businessman Jon Earls has the unusual hobby of coaxing musicians into his garden shed, where he films them playing with a digital camera. So far, more than 50 acts have performed several songs each. In truth, it's something of a labour of love for both the artists and Earls, with many of the videos having attracted less than 100 views in several months online and even the most-viewed session, by Scottish folk singer Alasdair Roberts, seen by less than 5,000 people. But there's an unmistakable warmth to this most lo-fi of online sessions. That much is proved by the latest session, from Americana troubadour Micah P Hinson, who fills the shed with a wonderfully grizzled, intense and heartfelt performance. Since the dawn of the internet, plenty of acts have used online computer games to help plug their music. Kylie Minogue's team recently launched an enjoyable Donkey Kong-esque platform game, at kylie.com/aphroditegame, which is slightly let down by the fact that it's soundtracked by the same 15-second instrumental loop of Get Outta My Way on repeat (you can turn the sound off). But Norwegian indie-poppers Team Me have raised the bar with their new game, which they've made instead of a video for the single, Weathervanes and Chemicals. At teammegame.com, you have the length of the song to guide the hero home through a pixelated world that ties in loosely with the track's lyrics. It's addictive, tricky and makes you fall in love with the string-soaked song through repeated listens. Best of all, if you can complete the game, a laugh-out-loud plot twist awaits you."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
