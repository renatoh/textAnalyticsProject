Mislintat arrived from Borussia Dortmund to replace Steve Rowley, who held the position for 21 years and spent 35 years at the club, before standing down this month. Dick Law, the American who has been the club\u2019s chief transfer negotiator for eight years, is scaling back his work with Arsenal and has already returned to his homeland. The continuing overhaul also led to June\u2019s recruitment of Huss Fahmy, a lawyer who was previously commercial and business affairs director at Team Sky, to focus on contracts. Sanlleh\u00ed is a former Barcelona director of football and worked at the Spanish club for 14 years. He will begin work at Arsenal in February and, according to an official statement, \u201clead future player negotiations and work alongside manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, chief executive Ivan Gazidis and contract negotiator Huss Fahmy. He will also represent and support the club with international and domestic governing bodies.\u201d On Tuesday morning, Yesterday Wenger said: \u201cYou have Dick Law who retires, and has gone back to the States. He is still with us for a while, but we look for somebody as well who has experience in negotiations. We have Huss, who is top drawer, but has just joined us, but is doing an excellent job. I rate him highly. There is still a need.\u201dWenger said yesterday that his vast managerial experience means he can identify the most able personnel on the continent, including both Mislintat and Sanlleh\u00ed. \u201cI know them all because I\u2019ve been in the game before them,\u201d he said. \u201cSo of course I know everybody in every club in Europe, basically I know them all.\u201d One thing Wenger no longer believes Sanlleh\u00ed will have to deal with is the transfer of either Mesut \u00d6zil or Alexis S\u00e1nchez. For the first time he has explicitly ruled out the possibility of either player leaving in January. \u201cYeah, I rule it out,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my head, they stay until the end of the season. That\u2019s the decision I took at the start of the season. Unless something unbelievable happens there\u2019s no reason why that should change.\u201d Having narrowly beaten Burnley 1-0 on Sunday Arsenal host Huddersfield tonighton Wednesday. D and, despite the looming visit of Manchester United on Saturday, Wenger insisted that his focus is entirely on the Terriers. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive game for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI watched their [2-1 defeat] against Manchester City, they didn\u2019t deserve to lose that game. These teams come from hell, they have to play 46 games in the Championship to get out of that. So when you play them you have to be ready for a fight. Especially in their first season, promoted teams have that kind of fighting spirit that makes them dangerous to any team they come up against.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
