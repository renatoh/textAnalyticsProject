The thin, cultish 1961 novel by the Polish author Stanislaw Lem reached beyond its sci-fi audience when it was adapted for the screen \u2013 first as a Soviet television play in 1968, and most recently in 2002 by Steven Soderbergh. But it\u2019s an epic, 1972 film adaptation by the Russian auteur Andrei Tarkovsky that made Solaris notorious. Three hours long, its slow meditation on humanity adrift in the cosmos was hailed as a work of contemplative genius and \u201cthe Soviet 2001\u201d by some critics, and condemned as an endurance event of potentially lethal dullness by generations of film studies students obliged to sit through it at school. What repels as much as attracts is its somewhat impregnable story: of a sentient planet that works simultaneous miracles and horror on the minds of a crew of displaced, shipbound cosmonauts. As their space station orbits the alien world, the crew members must contend with the sudden presence of facsimiles of people the planet recreates from their memories. For the onboard psychologist, the \u201cvisitor\u201d conjured for him is his beloved, suicided wife. What the planet intends with these resurrections perplexes the humans almost as much as how to now cope with the physical return of those they\u2019d learned to live without. An adaptation of Solaris was an irresistible challenge for Greig, who is the artistic director of Edinburgh\u2019s Royal Lyceum Theatre and one of Britain\u2019s most highly regarded living writers. He\u2019d long been fascinated by the Australian story of Picnic at Hanging Rock, and transferred Lutton\u2019s 2017 stage production to Scotland, where it was a massive hit. \u201cI really liked the idea of Picnic and the sensibility of it \u2026 its atmosphere of dread or slight horror,\u201d Greig says. Lutton\u2019s Picnic had a successful run at the Lyceum. \u201cAnd when Matthew came over, I asked, \u2018What are we doing next?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Solaris.\u2019\u201d Greig had last seen the Tarkovsky film as a student and at first couldn\u2019t imagine how a stage adaptation might work. \u201cI remembered this quite mysterious dreamlike thing,\u201d Greig says. \u201cI got the novel and started to read it, and within the first chapter I was completely hooked because it wasn\u2019t what I expected.\u201d Greig discovered that the story could be read as metaphorical for the theatrical process itself: \u201cA single-location drama about a contained world of people looking out of a window \u2026 [and then] we set off on a journey, and it was about many things.\u201d During rehearsals in Melbourne, for which Greig has been present, Lutton speaks of \u201cdiscovering more reasons why we\u2019re doing it\u201d. \u201cI thought we were doing a piece about politics and contact, and what you could do if you were bringing the dead back to life,\u201d he says. But Solaris has worked its obscure magic on the rehearsal room as well. \u201cYou\u2019re constructing characters and situations that are negotiating an alien presence that is impenetrable,\u201d Lutton explains. \u201cIt means theatrically we\u2019re constantly discussing, \u2018What is Solaris?\u2019 with more answers and questions about it. The idea has perpetual imagination built into it because you\u2019re constantly creating what it is.\u201d For Greig, that creation obliged liberating the story\u2019s previous incarnations from the prison of gender. Rewatching the Tarkovsky version, he discovered: \u201cIt\u2019s all men, there\u2019s barely a woman at all, except for the phantasm \u2026 and I remember thinking, \u2018Oh my god \u2013 Solaris is a woman!\u2019 They\u2019re all peering and staring and they\u2019re thinking, \u2018What is it saying? What does it want? It\u2019s so bewildering!\u2019 ... and it seemed almost comically clear what it was about.\u201d Lem\u2019s novel makes a more universal point, Greig explains, about how the alien encounter obliges the cosmonauts to assess their own humanity. \u201cA central part of being human is that in order to know there is a self we have to know there is an other, and how we negotiate our fear and desire about the other is at the heart of our consciousness of being human,\u201d he says. But the representation of \u201cwoman\u201d as this \u201cother\u201d is a tired cliche, the inclusion of which would date and deaden what is otherwise a timeless human story. To liberate Lem\u2019s point from the realm of mere male fantasy, Greig has swapped the gender of its human central character: Leeanna Walsman now plays the tortured psychologist Kelvin in a cast that also features Keegan Joyce (Please Like Me, Rake) as well as the UK\u2019s Fode Simbo and Jade Ogugua. Hugo Weaving appears as well, in video footage. The gender flip of the lead allows the action onstage to become more than just a rehash of the films, and to avoid the re-enactment of creaking sci-fi tropes that often reduce female characterisation to \u201can actress noodling around in a T-shirt looking fruity\u201d, Greig says. By making the protagonist a woman, Greig says, the play becomes an experience that transcends the conventions of sci-fi, and instead \u201cforces you to consider grief, desire, time and all the things that I think the book and the [Tarkovsky] film is really about.\u201d There may, of course, be self-aware noodling and T-shirts too \u2013 as befits the low-fi sci-fi analogue aesthetic of the space station on the Malthouse stage. \u201cEarly on, we discussed that we would never see the planet,\u201d Lutton says. \u201cIts presence would be felt. We wanted a theatrical space like a space station of endless hotel rooms like a maze endlessly reproducing themselves. And no digital. We wanted to do science fiction without any high-tech technology.\u201d Greig approved. \u201cWhen Lem wrote it and Tarkovsky directed it, they were imagining a future from [the vantage point of] an analogue world,\u201d he says. In staging terms, \u201cIt was much better to think of the future as it appeared from that time. It\u2019s a space station where people have books and smoke cigarettes, and look things up in encyclopaedias.\u201d \u2022 Solaris is on at the Malthouse Theatre in Melbourne, Australia from 28 June until 21 July 2019. It\u2019s on at the Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh, Scotland from 12 September until 5 October 2019, and at the Lyric Hammersmith, London from 10 October until 2 November"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
