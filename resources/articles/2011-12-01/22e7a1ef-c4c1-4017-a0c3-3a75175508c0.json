The change, which only affects the price of the monthly call plan and not calls, texts and other charges, comes into force on 8 January for most customers. It will add around \u00a31.50 a month to a \u00a335-a-month contract. Orange blamed the high rate of inflation for the move, which it says is allowed under its terms and conditions. In announcing the hike, Orange is following in Vodafone's footsteps. In September, Vodafone announced it was rounding up its pay monthly contracts to the nearest 50p. Orange said: \"Unfortunately, we've had to re-evaluate our prices for the first time and are sorry to say that there will be a 4.34% increase in our monthly plan prices \u2026 This is lower than the retail prices index (RPI) measure of inflation, which currently stands at 5.4%. Out-of-plan charges, such as calls, texts and data, will not be changing.\" Orange says its terms allow it to increase charges by up to the RPI figure in any 12-month period without giving customers the right to cancel their contract. The telecoms regulator, Ofcom, allows consumers to break a contract without penalty in certain circumstances, such as a big price hike. Given that the increase is below inflation, Orange argues this does not apply. Some Orange customers have reacted badly to the news. Many will have a sense of deja vu. In August 2009, the Guardian reported that Orange reversed a planned price rise after it was suggested it was breaching its terms and conditions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
