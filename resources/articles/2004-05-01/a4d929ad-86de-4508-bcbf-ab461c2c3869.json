Not in an intimidating throw-together-a-lobster-souffl\u00e9-while-brushing-up-my-Russian kind of way, but just competent enough to make supper for friends without a panic attack. Food for prospective lovers, though, was always more complicated. The food you choose to cook says as much about you as your clothes or your bookshelves, it's often the first sensual signal you offer. So striking a balance between the licking and sucking potential of moules marini\u00e8res and chocolate mousse (painfully obvious), and the neurotic implications of homemade sourdough bruschetta (obsessive perfectionist) and carpaccio of scallops (high maintenance anorexic), can be fraught. As men judged my food, so my view of their reaction mattered equally. Frankly, I've never had good sex with a vegetarian. I like men who eat properly, who like their steak bloody, their eggs Benedict runny. Fastidiousness is as unappealing in the kitchen as it is in the bedroom; there's something emasculated about a man who lets himself be faced down by an escargot. Logically, someone as obsessed by the food/sex correlation as I am would select her lovers accordingly; but as with cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e, I never quite had the discipline to resist what I knew would turn out badly (hence the vegetarian. He had little round glasses and did yoga. Really). However, experience did prove that whether or not a man knows his artichoke from his elbow, when it comes to cooking, if not to sex, the clich\u00e9s of national stereotypes hold true. Englishmen, on the whole, are wonderfully easy to cook for. Despite the foodie revolution that supposedly means the English can distinguish Pugliese from Ligurian olive oil at a single whiff, the legacy of the school dinner lives on, and English guys' culinary expectations remain reassuringly low. As with sex, they are so delightfully charmed to be getting any at all that you can serve them boil-in-the-bag cod and they'll carry on like you're Nigella Lawson if they think there's a chance of getting laid. Despite being deeply bored by people with carbohydrate anxiety, I did have two American boyfriends who were considerably more challenging. One was utterly fat phobic, convinced that the merest smear of animal lipids would provoke instant cardiac arrest, so quail stuffed with grapes and foie gras was not a winner. I vainly tried to explain that duck fat, after olive oil, is one of the cleanest fats, but arguing about cholesterol hardly counts as foreplay. The other, a New Yorker who was seeing two therapists simultaneously, claimed that my attempts to impress him with an authentic coq au vin indicated that I was deeply insecure. Fair enough, but a proper beurre manie takes hours to perfect and I wished he'd just eat his sodding casserole. He probably had a point, because I have never been relaxed enough to manage the Tom Jones approach to the dinner date. Crawling through the cutlery before we'd finished the first course seemed a waste, and the only time I did try to look lascivious with gravy in my hair was on a dodgy antique table with predictably slapstick results. Long before I had a kitchen of my own, I shared an unheated chambre de bonne near the Gare Montparnasse with a French boyfriend, plus the attractive combined shower and loo in the corner of his bedroom. The presence of a Turkish lav with a wooden grille to place over the hole when you wanted to wash didn't do much for the appetite, and since we never had any money, we spent most of the time in bed for warmth, subsisting on cornflakes and Marlboro Lights. This was fine, because we were both young enough to believe that One Hundred Years of Solitude was a really cool book, but the smells from downstairs were agonising. Six Senegalese porters lived in the single room below us, holding cheerful merguez barbecues with the window closed in case the landlord caught them. Sometimes they invited us to share, and the spicy sausages, with a smudge of fiery harissa, were wonderful, though it was hard to see our hosts through the smoke. When my boyfriend visited his parents on the coast, we were able to return the favour, as he reappeared with three huge live crabs that his father had caught that morning. Even after five hours in the train from Brittany, they were still squirming in his backpack. I had no idea what to do with them apart from the famous scene in Annie Hall, and we only had an electric hotplate. But I borrowed a pot and boiled them to scarlet stillness. It wasn't much for eight, but I still remember the crab picnic, ripping the scalding claws with our hands, wiping the buttery, lemony juices on baguettes, with a bunch of flowers nicked from the Jardin des Plantes tucked into the hole of the Turkish loo. Sexy French food can be more a matter of clever shopping than brilliance in the kitchen. The first white asparagus from the Landes needs only shaving and steaming, every fishmonger in Paris has a pile of ready-prepared langoustines, and with a homemade mayonnaise (made by the Bonne Marche, that is) and some Gariguette strawberries, you have a perfect, effortless seduction dinner. This approach leaves time to concentrate on equally important French details such as Diptyque candles and the right pair of Fifi Chachnil knickers. English nursery puddings, which are quite hard to ruin, are considered exotic, since most French women buy their desserts, but some details just don't translate. At a Christmas drinks party, I tried to entice a French art expert with mince pies made from the most delicate orange shortcrust pastry, but he was so disgusted by the idea of a 'meat' pie with fruit that I never got round to dazzling him with my knowledge of Simon Vouet. Nevertheless, when I got married I felt that I could manage most culinary challenges, but after a few attempts at cooking for my husband, I realised I was deluded. To say that Italians are parochial about food is an understatement; for them there is only one true cuisine, and that not even national, but fiercely, loyally provincial. French, Thai, Indian might be good, but it will only ever be stuff to eat. Since my husband is from Milan, I wasn't naive enough to brave a risotto, but I thought ragu alla Bolognese might be a safe place to start. I saut\u00e9ed chicken livers and pancetta, coddled a soffritto of onion, carrot and celery until soft and gleaming, added minced beef and pork, a few judicious wild mushrooms, half a bottle of hideously expensive Barolo and a home-made bouquet garni ingeniously contrived from my beloved Eve Lom muslin facial cloth. The passata came from tomatoes grown in my mother's garden in the South of France, laboriously boiled, peeled and deseeded. I simmered the sauce for three hours, then covered it in organic milk and finished it in the oven. The dialogue at dinner went something like this: Him: 'What's this?' Me: ' Spaghetti bolognese .' Him: 'Where are the peas?' Me: 'Ragu doesn't have peas in it.' Him: 'My Nonna Ernestina always put peas in her ragu.' Me: 'But this is Giorgio Locatelli's recipe. Without peas.' Him: (unintelligible mutterings in Milanese dialect, roughly translated as): 'Giorgio Locatelli can go to hell.' The ghost of Nonna Ernestina refuses to be exorcised. She haunts me like a Sicilian widow in a story by Sciascia. Perfectly al dente pasta must be genetic, because I can never get it right even with Olympic-precise timing. I use too much black pepper and spice, apparently because all English food was mouldy until the twentieth century and needed to be disguised. Elizabeth David was wrong about everything, the River Cafe recipes are comedy and the only recipe book worth reading (not that Nonna ever needed one), is Il Cucchiaio d'Argento , in Italian, which weighs as much as a whole prosciutto, and gives helpfully precise hints such as 'take half a medium-sized spoon of chestnut flour'. Maybe it's lucky that Italians don't go in for divorce. We've reached a compromise. I cook for friends: raw-beef Vietnamese salads, traditional English roast chicken, fish pie. The food we eat together, ' la cucina casalinga ', is his department, although I haven't entirely conceded defeat. He has developed a taste for proper white-bread bacon sarnies, with loads of HP sauce."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
