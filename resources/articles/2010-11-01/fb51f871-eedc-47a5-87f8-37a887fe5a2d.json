It may be a crass question, but how else to explain that, in spite of the victories of the women's movement and decades of equalities legislation, the number of composers who are not men is still so disproportionately small? Indeed, the number of women composers is small enough for it to be remarkable when a major music festival features more than a handful in its programme, which is what's on offer at this year's Huddersfield Contemporary Music festival: Jennifer Walshe's string quartets, a late-night showcase for Claudia Molitor and six works by Rebecca Saunders. Altogether, it features 16 women composers \u2013 still quite an imbalance considering it also includes music by 74 men. On the other hand, Huddersfield is doing better than Glastonbury, where 74% of the acts this year were male, and much better than the Proms, where only 4.1% of the composers were women. Claudia Molitor explains the disparity: \"If we are talking about society then certainly there are differences between genders. For a start, there are obviously fewer female composers.\" But like Jennifer Walshe, she dismisses any suggestion that there is a distinctly feminine music. \"From the idea that there is a not-male way of writing music one would have to conclude that there is something essential in female-written music, something that all music written by women has in common, and then, of course, that all music written by non-females similarly has something essential in common. This I find hard to see and I'd be tempted to conclude that there is nothing that distinguishes music along gender lines.\" It's a compelling argument which shifts the debate away from the way in which gender shapes creativity and towards larger social issues. If women musicians, and composers in particular, are still so badly under-represented then perhaps the problem is less to do with music itself than with the structures of the music business in which the cult of the ego-driven, sociopathic maestro is still prevalent. I suggest to Jennifer Walshe that the traditional composerly role is rooted in old-fashioned notions of masculinity. \"There is a default male composer role, and I don't fit it,\" she says. Molitor agrees, but points out that \"there are plenty of men who don't partake in that particular 'male' way of operating either\". Certainly, Walshe, Molitor and Rebecca Saunders all make music that questions conventional ideas of the relationship between composer, performer and audience. Saunders is fascinated with the tactile immediacy of sound; when she talks about her music her hands are constantly moving, fingers and thumbs rubbing together as if she could manipulate the sonic material itself. It's a gesture that seems to belong in a sculptor's studio, or a bakery, rather than in the rehearsal room. In Chroma, the most substantial of her works to be presented in Huddersfield, she's found a way to translate this sense of sound you can touch into space. First performed in 2003 in the vastness of the Tate Modern Turbine Hall and now reconfigured for the more complicated, interconnected spaces of Huddersfield Town Hall, Chroma invites its listeners to \"mix the music with your feet\". The musicians are scattered around the space, mostly in twos and threes, and rather than sitting in passive ranks their spectators must move too, changing their aural perspectives for themselves. It's a liberating idea, allowing each member of the audience to have an intimate encounter with music which is nevertheless conceived on a grand scale. There's a different flexibility in Molitor's work, a give and take between performers and composer which loosens the seams that hold music together. Molitor's scores are fantastical graphic inventions, full of notational experiments \u2013 twisting stave lines, noteheads changing shape and floating away from any conventional musical meaning \u2013 and they need musicians with the same sort of fantasy. In Huddersfield, Molitor is working with five improvising musicians, ideal partners for what she describes as \"a collaboration where each of us brings their own practice to the event, mine happening to be composition\". Hers is also a practice which habitually \"frays out into other art forms, in this case film\". The piece opens with a film in which we see \"a desk, which turns out to be a little model stage, and finally the actual stage with live performers\". It's like watching a documentary about the compositional process merge into the performance itself. Jennifer Walshe is a composer who performs and makes films and graphic scores, too. She's probably best known for XXX LIVE NUDE GIRLS!!!, an opera acted out by Barbie dolls, but most of her music has a similarly bold theatricality, even when she's writing for that most classical of all music ensembles, the string quartet. In Huddersfield, the Bozzini Quartet will play two of the three works she's written for the medium and, as she explained to me, it took her some time to think her way into the possibilities of an instrumental grouping that's been around since the middle of the 18th century. \"I was very much concerned with taking the instrumental sounds apart,\" she says. \"The idea of writing solely pitched-based music for string quartet did not make sense to me; it seemed like trying to think in a completely different language in which I had a vocabulary which consisted only of adverbs.\" To find the rest of the vocabulary she needed, she spent a lot of time experimenting with the instruments, exploring and exploiting the different sounds they could make and eventually the music of :blurt emerged, which she describes as \"a noisy thicket of scratches and muffled shrieks, knocks and dim sinister tickings\". The later piece, Marlowe S., was written for the Bozzinis last year and, says Walshe, \"extends my earlier concerns with sound into the realm of the visual\". From Haydn to Beethoven to Bart\u00f3k, music for string quartet has always been full of dramatic confrontations between these four instruments, bound together like partners in a marriage, but only in a Jennifer Walshe quartet would the cellist pull a gun on one of the violinists. Iconoclastic, or just silly? That's a matter of opinion. What is more certain is that we're at a significant moment in the development of what is sometimes known as \"contemporary classical music\", the sort of music in which the Huddersfield Contemporary Music festival specialises, because the most exciting new music seems to have less and less to do with classical music traditions. Many of the instruments may be familiar from classical music but almost everything else \u2013 the distinctions between \"noise\" and \"music\", the authority of notated scores, the passivity of audiences \u2013 is up for grabs. Whatever this new music is called and whether it is male or female sensibilities that shape it, it's composers like Rebecca Saunders, Claudia Molitor and Jennifer Walshe who are making the difference. The Huddersfield Contemporary Music festival runs from 19 to 28 November. Details: hcmf.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
