Launching a new system of regulation for the expanding profession, Antony Townsend said there were instances of gross overcharging and consumers needed to be given more information about costs. \"The key concerns that came up from consumers [in our research] were to do with information,\" he explained. \"The biggest worries were lack of clear expectations and a lack of clarity about charging. Clients feel they don't know what's going on, there are delays that are unexplained and they are handed a huge bill at the end.\" There are more than 156,000 solicitors in England and Wales, a figure that continues to rise. Not all of them are practicing - last year 79 were struck off for various aspects of professional misconduct. Among the most exclusive City firms and divorce experts, fees of up to \u00a3700 an hour are not uncommon. The SRA does not impose a cap on fees but believes its duty is to ensure that there is greater transparency. \"There are some cases of gross overcharging and we do take action,\" Townsend said. \"But we are not a price regulator. Where someone has been grossly exploited we will take action. \"Our concern is mainly where it has not been made clear what the charges are likely to be.\" For a client to wait two years and then suddenly be presented with a bill for \u00a320,000 when they expected far lower charges was not acceptable, he said. The SRA's priority is not securing refunds for large financial firms who have in-house lawyers to pursue such claims, Townsend said. \"An immigrant facing an asylum appeal is much more vulnerable and the risk there is something with which we should be concerned.\" The SRA is funded by the Law Society, the body which represents solicitors, and operates in accordance with the statutory requirements of the Legal Services Act. It describes its regulation as independent and is in the process of altering the composition of its board so that the majority is no longer formed by solicitors but by lay members. Its new code of conduct has been revised to reflect changes in the legal profession brought into effect by what are known as alternative business structures (ABS). The government-backed ABS reforms are intended make legal services more accessible to the public by allowing lawyers to work in partnerships with other professionals. The justice minister, Jonathan Djanogly, has said that it will enable people to obtain legal help more easily in places like supermarkets and online. Opponents of the reform fear it will sound the death knell for the traditional, high street solcitors firm. The SRA's expanded role will bring all these new firms under its oversight. \"This [new code] is about a relentless focus on the interest of consumers and the public interest,\" Townsend said. \"We hope it makes it easier for consumers to know what a regulated law firm should do for them.\" The authority will, in future, have to police the ban on referral fees which the government has promised to enforce, and is about to launch a consultation on whether, in an era of globalisation, its role should extend to regulating the proliferating overseas offices of UK law firms. The organisation is also considering protection for whistleblowers to encourage solicitors and firms to report misconduct or confess errors at an early stage. Will a double-dip recession trigger a fresh outbreak of embezzlement cases among lawyers? \"Yes,\" Townsend agreed. \"Small firms are operating in a very difficult environment. In desperate times solicitors may borrow money from the clients' account and it goes from bad to worse. \"In the last 18 months we have seen a big increase in the number of firms we have had to close ... It's often related to the housing market. When that collapses, problems suddenly become visible.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
