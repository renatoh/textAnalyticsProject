Surely, continued the questioner, Sunderland are synonymous with getting in the faces of their opponents? \u201cNo,\u201d said the manager, seizing an opportunity to drop his bosses a not so cryptic hint. \u201cThat was the characteristic of one Sunderland, the one with Kevin Phillips and Niall Quinn. The rest of the teams of Sunderland did not have any characteristics. They were rubbish. They were playing for relegation and suffering. I am trying something but we are miles away to a point that worries me.\u201d If Roy Keane, Steve Bruce, Martin O\u2019Neill and Paolo Di Canio may be less than delighted to see their endeavours at the Stadium of Light trashed so comprehensively, it is hard to believe Ellis Short, who has spent countless millions on the squad, will be overjoyed either. The message Poyet is trying to convey to Sunderland\u2019s owner, not to mention Lee Congerton, the sporting director, is that he is the club\u2019s first manager since Peter Reid to attempt to introduce a defined playing philosophy. In order to create this clearly identifiable brand Poyet believes players capable of fulfilling his sweet-passing vision must be recruited. A keen politician, he used a subsequent question asking him to quantify precisely how \u201crubbish\u201d Sunderland are to reinforce the point that significant investment is required. \u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019m just saying what I feel. We have to be realistic. Sunderland have been in the top-10 once in 15 years. The rest have been full of bad decisions and suffering. We need to find a way of playing a certain way. As a team we\u2019re not adaptable and not intelligent.\u201d Brendan Rodgers would doubtless advise his Sunderland counterpart that every problem contains the genesis of a solution. Poyet once claimed that without Luis Su\u00e1rez, Liverpool would merely be mid-table also-rans but after a difficult transition to life following the striker\u2019s transfer, Rodgers looks to be heading back towards the sunlit uplands. With Daniel Sturridge still to return from long-term injury, Liverpool may yet achieve the top-four finish their manager craves. They have now lost once in their past 13 games and a side lacking not just Sturridge but also Raheem Sterling \u2013 sunning himself on a long-planned break in Jamaica \u2013 Adam Lallana and Glen Johnson should really have won by three or four more goals. Sunderland simply could not fathom Rodgers\u2019s fluid 3-4-3 formation. Without the injured Lee Cattermole around to galvanise the Wearsiders, the fast improving Lazar Markovic was afforded space to shine and could have easily have added to his ninth-minute winner. When Liam Bridcutt was sent off for a second bookable offence in the 49th minute it looked all over for Sunderland but perhaps taking advantage of Steven Gerrard\u2019s half-time withdrawal with a tight hamstring, Poyet\u2019s players staged a minor revival. \u201cWe gave away 45 minutes,\u201d said a manager whose side have won one of their past 11 league games and look set for another relegation skirmish. \u201cAfter that we tried. I cannot ask for any more with the personnel we\u2019ve got. We sorted things out at half-time but the disappointing thing was that I\u2019d expected my team to be able to work things out for themselves. But there was confusion about Liverpool\u2019s system.\u201d Short and Congerton are entitled to wonder what Rodgers might have done in Poyet\u2019s place. The Sunderland manager\u2019s first-half tactic of asking his full-backs, Santiago Vergini and Patrick van Aanholt, to mark Philippe Coutinho and Gerrard while demanding that his wingers, Adam Johnson and Emanuele Giaccherini, minded Markovic and Alberto Moreno, backfired disastrously. Quite apart from being hugely ineffective defensively \u2013 Coutinho, particularly, destroyed Vergini \u2013 Johnson and Giaccherini were prevented from using their talents to hurt Liverpool. It was no surprise Poyet\u2019s team managed only one shot on target. Perhaps it is simply down to vitamin D deprivation? Rodgers believes a holiday somewhere rather nearer the equator would do every Premier League footballer good at this time of year. If sending Sterling to the sun was an overriding priority \u2013 \u201cRaheem needed a rest, physically and mentally\u201d \u2013 there are several others at Anfield who would benefit immensely from a similar recharge. \u201cA winter break is something that must happen,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cPeople talk about tradition but is it a tradition to see your best players injured and out for long periods? We must be so clever here because the whole of Europe has a rest. It would absolutely benefit every player, mentally as well as physically.\u201d Man of the match Lazar Markovic (Liverpool)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
