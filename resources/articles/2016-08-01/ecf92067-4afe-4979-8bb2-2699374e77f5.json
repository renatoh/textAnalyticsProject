The opposite turned out to be true. Live coverage boomed and so did match attendances. Now a similar phenomenon seems to be happening with another British institution, the summer music festival. In a bid to encourage people to attend the real thing, festivals such as Dekmantel in the Netherlands and The Social in Maidstone are broadcasting themselves on online channels such as Facebook Live, Boiler Room and BE AT TV. Even the Notting Hill carnival is getting in on the act this year, with 42 hours of live streaming planned for audiences around the world. \u201cStreaming festivals gives millions of people a taste of what your event is about. Provided you\u2019ve got something special to broadcast, it can be a hugely powerful way of turning your event from reaching a few hundred thousand to millions,\u201d said Blaise Bellville, founder and chief executive of Boiler Room. Although most music fans would not compare watching an event online with actually being there, streaming festivals increases prestige and persuades more people to attend the real thing. \u201cFestivals that have embraced live streaming have risen above the pack and are watching their ticket sales continue to rise,\u201d said Ray Smith, director of BE AT TV, which has fans tuning in from more than 150 countries. Music TV at festivals used to mean the BBC Red Button backstage at Glastonbury. Now, punters can see what it is like before they buy their ticket. Daisy Cantalamessa, 29, from Oxford, says if there is a festival she has not been to before, she will watch the streams online to decide if she wants to go. \u201cI\u2019ve watched stuff when I\u2019ve not been to see what I\u2019ve missed, but mainly I watch to see if it\u2019s somewhere I want to go. When I looked at Awakenings in Amsterdam, I knew I wanted to go and I think the videos did it justice.\u201d With many people watching streams on their laptops, festivals can reach an audience regardless of their travel, work or family commitments, and with the average four-day ticket costing around \u00a3163 (according to festicket.com), online viewing is making them accessible to those who would have been priced out. \u201cFor those that can\u2019t afford it or it doesn\u2019t fit their lifestyle, we\u2019re here to deliver that 24/7,\u201d said Smith. \u201cStreaming a festival live online ensures anyone in the world can participate and engage with an event regardless of whether or not they can afford to be there in person.\u201d Belville agrees. \u201cThere are millions of music fans who, for whatever reason, are unable to attend in real life.We stream to our own Facebook page, which has 1.5 million subscribers, as well as to the pages of all performing artists and media partners. The end result is that an artist playing Boiler Room is in effect playing to 100 stadiums full of music fans.\u201d Maurizio Vitale, founder of Movement Europe and Kappa Futur festivals, says that performances this summer from the likes of Derrick May, Kerri Chandler and Marco Carola reached between 37,000 and 290,000 viewers. Although Vitale says this model certainly helps to attract new audiences to the next editions of the festivals, it\u2019s not the only way to reach new crowds. \u201cWord of mouth will always be a strong tool to attract new potential customers,\u201d he said. Jake Bailey, head of marketing at The Social Festival UK, agreed. \u201cIn the past it has always been down to a lot of physical marketing as well as word of mouth with flyers, posters and billboards. Streaming is just another tool that\u2019s used to market an event.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
