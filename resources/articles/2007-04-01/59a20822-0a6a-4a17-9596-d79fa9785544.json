Dismissing any suggestions that his side are under pressure following the weekend league defeat at Portsmouth, however, Ferguson remained upbeat about United's prospects against the Serie A side. An invaluable away goal in the 2-1 defeat in the Stadio Olimpico last Wednesday will, the manager believes, prove crucial as United attempt to extend their interest on three fronts. To do that, though, Ferguson's side must shed their unwanted record of never having overcome a first-leg deficit in this competition. Disappointment has followed on each of the five occasions United have entered the second leg in arrears, most recently against Milan two seasons ago, and while the manager predictably rejected the statistic as a cause for concern, United's chances of ending the run and reaching the semi-finals have certainly not been made any easier by the loss of Louis Saha and Paul Scholes. Ferguson confirmed Saha had failed to recover from a hamstring injury picked up in training last Friday, but it is the absence of Paul Scholes, sent off in the first leg, that will be more keenly felt tonight at Old Trafford. \"Of course we will make chances, but my experience in some European games is that we have sometimes missed chances, particularly in the two semi-final ties [against Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Dortmund] here,\" Ferguson said. \"So if we can create the chances and take a percentage then I think we have a massive chance. \"I think we are in a good position. We are pleased we scored after going down to 10 men in Rome and when we did score they became very nervous. Our attacking impetus will be much stronger and more apparent but of course we need to perform well and take our chances.\" Francesco Totti last night said the clash with United is more important than the World Cup final. \"As a Roma supporter this game is more important to me than the World Cup final was,\" the player said. Roma's coach Luciano Spalletti will make a late decision on the forward's fitness ahead of the return leg after the player arrived in England struggling to overcome a hamstring strain. It is widely anticipated the Italian World Cup winner will feature against United at some time tonight but Spalletti insists the injury is giving cause for concern. \"I need to see him in training and check on him,\" he said. Providing Totti makes it Roma may show just one change tonight. With the Ashton-born Simone Perrotta suspended an immediate recall is expected for the Chile international David Pizarro, who was himself banned for the first leg. Mindful of the threat offered by Spalletti's side, who lie second in Serie A, Ferguson was keen to put his team's recent problems into perspective. \"I don't think it is any more tense than any other European tie,\" he added. \"Certainly no different to when the great Juventus teams came here or when Milan came here two or three years ago. We have been at this stage many times. Losing a game is not an unusual factor in football, everyone loses at some time. It's what you do about it that makes your team and I am confident about that.\" Rooney's goal in Rome last week, his first in the Champions League for almost three seasons, could hardly have been better timed. The England striker, though, believes it is Cristiano Ronaldo who will carry United hopes, describing his Portugese team-mate as the best player in the world and insisting the pair have matured since the tame defeat by Milan in 2005. \"It's different playing against Italian teams, it's like a game of chess really, the game's slower and it's a lot more organised,\" said the England striker. \"When we faced Milan, myself and Cristiano were really young and we were still trying to learn the game. But I think since then both of us have improved and we have matured a lot, especially Cristiano who has been winning games on his own. This season he has been unbelievable and at the moment he is by far the best player in the world.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
