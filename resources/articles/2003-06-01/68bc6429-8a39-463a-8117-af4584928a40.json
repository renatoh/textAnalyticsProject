Sir Christopher Meyer, Britain's former ambassador to Washington, rejected the chance to become chairman of the bid committee because he said it would interfere with his new role as head of the Press Complaints Commission. It has left the way open for the 42-year-old American Barbara Cassani, founder of the low-cost airline Go, to take on the \u00a3200,000-a-year position. Her appointment will be formally announced tomorrow, ahead of the British Olympic Association's annual meeting in London, or on Thursday. Meyer said Cassani's first task must be to get the government to commit to provide the funds necessary to develop the area of east London earmarked for the games. \"There are quite long odds against us winning but it can be done,\" he said. \"One thing that the chairman has to get out of the government - and signed in blood - is written commitments to invest in the infrastructure, which would put us not just on a par with other candidates such as Paris but ahead of them.\" The multilingual Meyer, the overwhelming choice of the government and BOA, said that the job had been attractive to him. But he decided it would have interfered with his position at the PCC. \"I would have got the glory if we had won and I would have taken the rap if we had lost,\" Meyer said. \"I would have been prepared to do that but only if I could have given it my all and there were simply not enough days in the week to do it.\" Cassani, who earned \u00a39.5m when Go was sold to EasyJet last year, will begin work immediately and her first trip abroad to promote the bid will be to the International Olympic Committee congress in Prague next month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
