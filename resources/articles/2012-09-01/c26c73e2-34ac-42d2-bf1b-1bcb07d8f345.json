He goes as far now to suggest he was \"saddened\" to have been denied the opportunity to represent his country at the European Championship yet, as he holidayed in Spain over the summer, the raw emotions might have been more of anger. The Chelsea centre-half should have been attempting to snuff out Zlatan Ibrahimovic or Karim Benzema but, instead, he was watching on television from afar while eating mashed tortilla and drinking soup through a straw, his jaw held in place by metal plates. His script had veered off course. Normality has been resumed since, though some lingering regret remains. Cahill travels to Moldova on Thursday hoping he will be offered the opportunity to gain an 11th cap but, realistically, suspecting his absence in Ukraine may have seen Joleon Lescott leapfrog him in the pecking order to become John Terry's partner at this level. The Cahill-Terry pairing had felt a natural fit for club and country up to the incident in England's last friendly before the finals, against Belgium, that cost the junior man his place. The visitors' winger Dries Mertens shoved the centre-half in the back as the ball bobbled into the England box, and the defender collided with his goalkeeper, Joe Hart, and heard the crunch as jaw struck shoulder. There was no personal apology for the offence, only a vague expression of regret issued to the media while Cahill awaited the x-ray results. \"I suppose [a private apology] might have been nice,\" the centre-half says. \"It wasn't great for him to have done that, but I don't think for one minute he thought he was going to break my jaw. It was just a freak thing. And Joe Hart was not the person to choose to run into. I probably should have gone for an Ashley Young or somebody like that. I'd felt the impact and would have been surprised if they'd told me it wasn't broken, even if I was clinging on to a bit of hope, but the scans showed the damage. They put the metal plates in, bandaged me up to keep everything together, and that was me. \"To have suffered that just before we set off for what would have been my first big tournament, something I was so looking forward to being a part of, well, it was massively disappointing. It was a soft food diet for a few weeks, painful at times, and a struggle to clean your teeth \u2013 not ideal. I watched the England games, not the other matches, on holiday in Spain and obviously I was a bit upset and saddened not to be there when you see the lads lining up. I felt I should have been a part of it. But there you go. \"One of the positives that came out of the Euros was how well the boys defended, which makes my job now a bit harder. But I'll just have to fight to get myself back involved. But there's no change there. I've never sat back and rested on my laurels, thinking 'I'm in the side now'. There's always someone in front or behind you.\" The annoyance is that, on 2 June, it had been Hart and Mertens, though Cahill is attempting to move on. The 26-year-old has no reason to suspect his chance of gracing a finals has gone for ever. This is a player who was plucked from a relegation scrap at Bolton in January and ended last term an FA Cup winner and key member of the Chelsea side that claimed the Champions League in Munich, startling progress reflected in his performances on the pitch. The \u00a37m signing had been shaky initially, as if unnerved by the toils at the Reebok Stadium from which he had escaped, but grew into the London side's lineup. Already this season he has impressed at times, scored two goals \u2013 one of them eye-catching against Reading \u2013 and has taken to speaking off the pitch as a leader-in-waiting. He seems settled and certain he belongs. \"The Champions League run made me learn,\" he says. \"It allowed me to play in big games, the matches people had pointed out I'd never had before. Those players who don't come from the big clubs have always got that: 'Can he do it on the big stage?' There was no Champions League at Bolton, so it was a question mark over my head, so it was nice to offer an answer. But I want to keep proving myself at that level. That whole experience made me hungrier to be involved in matches like that, driving me on even more. It's the same with England. There were times when I travelled with England \u2013 10 or 11 times \u2013 but never got on the pitch. I was sitting in the stands a lot and only being called in when people couldn't make it. That makes me appreciate my involvement now even more, and the fact I feel I can fight for a place in the side these days is pleasing.\" He will compete with Lescott this week and hope to receive the nod from Roy Hodgson on Friday night. Yet, even if he ends up on the bench, his time will surely come again. Cahill has a summer on the sidelines to make up for."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
