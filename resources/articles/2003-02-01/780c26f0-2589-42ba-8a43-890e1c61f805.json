Millwall expect to pocket about \u00a3400,000 from the tie and, though a win would deliver only a small-change game with Norwich, victory in that would open up the prospect of a money-spinner against the likes of Manchester United or Arsenal in the quarter-finals. Ah, the magic of the FA Cup. \"I wasn't able to spend a penny this season because of the ITV Digital collapse,\" McGhee says. \"But if we got to the sixth round and played one of the big clubs it could generate enough money to take care of most of next year's problems in terms of players.\" He is aware, of course, that his club could be thinking bank and Monte Carlo if they gatecrash the play-offs and win a place in the Premiership. With the team's two most influential players, Richard Sadlier and Tim Cahill, almost ready to return from injury, the Lions could arrive in the play-off zone with a following wind. \"We're only two points off the play-offs and there is no way on earth that if Sadlier and Cahill had been fit all season that they would have only been worth two more points,\" McGhee says. \"I would guesstimate that it would have been more like 10, though realistically promotion should be out of sight. We're just lucky that it's been a mediocre First Division this term.\" Millwall have been further hampered by the ID system imposed on them by police because of a riot after last season's play-off elimination. Fans are allowed in only after producing passports and household bills to prove their addresses, and for some reason a large number of people in SE16 seemed reluctant to reveal such information. From average gates of 11,500 last season they are down below 9,000. \"It was an amputation,\" says McGhee, \"and there are still some fans who won't come back because they've had enough of the trouble. But there's been none this season so we might win those back in the long run.\" For McGhee, the most welcome face at the New Den this evening will be that of the Saints manager Gordon Strachan, who became his closest friend in football during their time as Aberdeen players. Strachan stood by his best man during McGhee's pariah period after his sacking by Wolves five years ago, inviting him to help at Coventry. \"I spent quite a lot of time with Gordon, scouting for him and even training with the team,\" McGhee says. \"There was a right good team emerging. Then [Moustapha] Hadji and [Youssef] Chippo went away to the African Nations for two months and [Robbie] Keane was sold and Gordon and Coventry never really recovered. But having seen what he was capable of, I'm not surprised what he has done at Southampton.\" If Millwall go up, he would hope to build a smaller-scale model at the New Den. But tonight he and his players will simply be concentrating on covering themselves in glory. \"Southampton have got every chance of beating us,\" he says, \"but they won't find it easy.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
