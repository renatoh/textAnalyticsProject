As the Microphones, and then Mount Eerie, he had spent 20 years pushing lo-fi songwriting into profound and unwieldy places. Then, in 2016, Genevi\u00e8ve Castr\u00e9e died from cancer. A 2017 album, A Crow Looked at Me, was uncharacteristically prosaic: the arrival of a backpack that Castr\u00e9e had ordered for their infant daughter spelled out his desolation. Like Nick Cave\u2019s Skeleton Tree, the album\u2019s beauty attracted morbid sympathy from outside the usual quarters. A year later, Now Only found Elverum tilling grief while looking for sense. Then headlines suggested he had found some balance after secretly marrying actor Michelle Williams. The marriage lasted less than a year. \u201cUnwanted attention from an inhumane, delirious, absurd other world that keeps trying to eat you,\u201d is how Elverum recalls the tabloids breaking the story on Widows. But, he makes clear on these discomfitingly intimate songs, it wasn\u2019t the tabloids that ended their relationship but his enduring grief. You suspect the famously private Williams may not want these things made public. Yet Elverum sings with remarkable equanimity about their breakup, transcending prurient intrigue so that any heartbroken person could find solace in his quiet pride at two bereaved people finding love (\u201cas long as the one last leap into the dark is whole-hearted\u201d, on Enduring the Waves) and his determination to keep loving, \u201cvehemently\u201d (Real Lost Wisdom). There are no recriminations, only an occasional, cathartic blast of static in these otherwise barely formed songs \u2013 largely comprising his conversational delivery, singer Julie Doiron, and a bluntly thumbed acoustic guitar. As with A Crow Looked at Me, you marvel at Elverum\u2019s simultaneous faith in beauty after loss and ability to express ineffable sadness: \u201cThe world we could share, the one we lived in for a moment, still lies fertile in the dark,\u201d he sings on Belief Pt 2. \u201cI go there, alone there.\u201d It\u2019s a hard place to go with him; confrontationally stark, it may be the rare album that works better on paper."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
