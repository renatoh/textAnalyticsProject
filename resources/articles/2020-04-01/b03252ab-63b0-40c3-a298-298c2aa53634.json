In the next few days, we will reach one million confirmed cases and 50,000 deaths.\u201d Known global cases surge past 900,000 mark According to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, at least 932,605 people have now been infected around the world, though suspected underreporting by various countries means the figure is likely to be significantly higher. The researchers have counted at least 46,809 deaths, while they say 193,177 people have recovered. UK government faces criticism over strategy British newspapers, including those normally supportive of the Conservatives, lambasted the Tory government over shortages of equipment as it emerged that just 2,000 of half a million frontline National Health Service staff had been tested. Ministers have been coming under increasing pressure to explain their plans and the Guardian detailed the unravelling of the government\u2019s initial testing strategy \u2013 and the valuable time it wasted. Cop26 climate talks are suspended A key UN climate summit that was due to take place in Glasgow in November has been postponed until 2021. \u201cThe world is currently facing an unprecedented global challenge and countries are rightly focusing their efforts on saving lives and fighting Covid-19,\u201d organisers said. Activists acknowledged that the move was necessary, but urged governments not to forget the climate crisis even as they deal with the pandemic. French death toll passes 4,000 France becomes the fourth country to pass the 4,000 threshold, following Italy, Spain and the US. The daily government tally accounts only for those dying in hospitals, but authorities say they will soon be able to compile data on deaths in retirement homes, which is likely to result in a big increase in registered fatalities. The current total is 4,032 people. UK to call up 3,000 army reservists The personnel will be assigned to help with the UK\u2019s pandemic response, bringing the strength of the armed forces\u2019 virus response to about 23,000. They will be needed to help with medical and logistical support for the NHS and to act as liaison officers, among other things. No one working for the National Health Service or delivering frontline services will be mobilised, officials say. US personal protective equipment stocks nearly exhausted \u2013 Trump The US president says the federal stockpile of personal protective equipment is nearly empty, \u201cbecause we\u2019re sending it directly to hospitals\u201d. Earlier, CNN reported that the \u201cStrategic National Stockpile is deploying the last round of shipments in its inventory, depleting the bulk of its protective gear\u201d. US intelligence accuses China of playing down crisis American officials reportedly believe China has been underreporting the total number of cases and deaths. The conclusions of a classified report from the intelligence community to the White House were revealed to Bloomberg by three anonymous officials who declined to give details about its contents. They reportedly say the thrust was that China\u2019s concealment was deliberate and that the report was received by the White House last week. Germany extends distancing measures Physical distancing measures have been extended in Germany until at least 19 April and will be re-evaluated on the Tuesday after Easter, Angela Merkel has said. The German chancellor spoke after a telephone conference with the premiers of Germany\u2019s 16 states on Wednesday afternoon, in which they agreed a draft resolution urging people \u201cto keep contact with people beyond their own household to an absolute minimum, even during the Easter holidays, in accordance with the applicable rules\u201d, according to German media cited by the broadcaster Deutsche Welle. Growth in Italy\u2019s death toll slows Another 727 people have died in Italy, taking the total to 13,155. That represents the smallest increase since 26 March. Nevertheless, figures from the Civil Protection Agency show that the number of new cases rose more sharply than a few days earlier, growing by 4,782 compared with 4,053. Lockdown measures in the country are to be extended to 13 April, the health minister, Roberto Speranza, has said. He told the Senate on Wednesday: \u201cWe must not confuse the first positive signals with an \u2018all clear\u2019 signal. Data shows that we are on the right path and that the drastic decisions are bearing fruit.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
