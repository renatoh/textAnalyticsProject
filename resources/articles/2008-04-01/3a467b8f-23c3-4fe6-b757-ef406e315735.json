Self-destructive tendencies have come in such exasperating rotation that just one calculated, consistent team could have streaked away with automatic promotion weeks ago. Bristol City had their chance but seemed to sense they were on the top by default. They weaved pretty patterns yet could not score goals. On Saturday their manager, Gary Johnson, stood motionless by the dug-out. His arms were behind his back as if on a street corner, wondering how he could get the traffic to flow more freely. Again he employed a lone striker but it was not a success until the last 20 minutes, although Steve Brooker, making his first start in a year, battled bravely and was by some distance City's best player. Unfortunately he was mostly out of touch with Darren Byfield, in an ill-conceived, ineffective role just behind him. Johnson, chirpy by nature, was strangely subdued afterwards. He called it \"a blood-and-thunder game with both sides defending stoutly\" - not wholly true: the leggy Jamie McCombe was untypically nervous and confused early on, nearly handing two goals to Wolves, who were narrowly the more positive, worthily staking their own play-off claims. It was a tight game, not devoid of skills but too tense for the occasion. Wolves would have sneaked a win but for Adriano Basso's agile goalkeeping and a late penalty seemingly missed by the referee, Paul Taylor. Nick Carle, not long on as a substitute, brought down the dangerous winger Matt Jarvis and, as Wolves' manager, Mick McCarthy, saw it: \"The crowd went very quiet - they knew it was a penalty. Everyone did except the man who counted.\" In the next breath, as if eager to be generous and not to harbour a grievance, McCarthy said the referee had a good game. Wolves had the edge in midfield where the injured Lee Johnson, a dainty passer and catalyst for City's hard-earned raids, was missed. In the first half they gave away the ball too often and wasted the final crosses. Neil Collins excelled with calm efficiency in the Wolves defence and Wayne Hennessey was a commanding goalkeeper. They went near with a speculative drive from 30 yards by the busy Seyi Olofinjana, a jab from Jarvis was reached by Basso at the foot of the near post and a late effort by George Elokobi was cleared off the line by Brooker. For City it is now a worrying, near goal-barren one win in eight games; next season's status remains in limbo.
