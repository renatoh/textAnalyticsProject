Air Force One landed at a Marine Corps air station in Miramar, outside San Diego, on Tuesday morning, heralding Trump\u2019s first presidential visit to the US\u2019s most populous state and economic powerhouse. He inspected prototypes of his proposed border wall at Otay Mesa, yards from the border with Mexico, while a mile down the road police in riot gear separated rival groups of demonstrators chanting for and against Trump. Some gave the presidential motorcade the middle finger. \u201cFor the people that say no wall, if you didn\u2019t have walls over here, you wouldn\u2019t even have a country,\u201d Trump said, repeating a line from his campaign. The US needed a strong border to stop criminal and terrorist infiltration, he said. \u201cTruly our first line of defense \u2026 it\u2019ll save thousands of lives. The state of California is begging us to build walls in certain areas. They don\u2019t tell you that.\u201d Trump expressed preference for a see-through wall to let border patrol agents monitor the other side. He asked an official which of the eight prototypes was likeliest to deter would-be border jumpers. \u201cThese are like professional mountain climbers.\u201d He also assailed the state\u2019s governor, Jerry Brown, as soft on crime and illegal migration. \u201cThe place is totally out of control. You have sanctuary cities where you have criminals living.\u201d Brown responded in a tweet stressing California\u2019s economic might. \u201cThanks for the shout-out, @realDonaldTrump. But bridges are still better than walls. And California remains the 6th largest economy in the world and the most prosperous state in America. #Facts\u201d Heavy security corralled protests on both sides of the border, a scene expected to be repeated in Los Angeles where Trump was due to attend a GOP fundraiser in the evening before returning to Washington on Wednesday. No president since Franklin Roosevelt has waited this long to visit California. Trump did so trailing upheaval in Washington where he had fired the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, via tweet \u2013 later phoning Tillerson from Air Force One \u2013 before resuming an unprecedented White House confrontation with California. Democrats, who dominate statewide posts and the legislature in Sacramento, poured scorn on their visitor even before he touched down. \u201cSome people think that medieval walls might keep us safe in this country,\u201d Xavier Becerra, the attorney general, told reporters. It would be good only to deter knights on horses, he said. Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor who is running for governor, released an animated video caricaturing Trump and his slogan, \u201cMake America great again\u201d, as \u201cMake America white again\u201d. \u201cDonald Trump finally worked up the nerve to visit California, bringing his fear-of-everything agenda with him,\u201d Newsom said in a voiceover. \u201cLet\u2019s get real. Donald Trump\u2019s border wall is a monument to idiocy.\u201d Community and Latino groups rallied in and around San Diego and the Mexican city of Tijuana, which abuts the border. Police restricted demonstrators near the wall prototypes to a \u201cfree speech zone\u201d and banned potential weapons including glass containers, rocks, slingshots, knives and guns. Members of the US Secret Service were reportedly in Tijuana in recent days coordinating security with Mexican authorities. A protest on the Mexican side of the San Ysidro point of entry passed off peacefully in the morning. Others were expected. Trump lost California to Hillary Clinton by 4.3 million votes, costing him the national popular vote, but red pockets in the state cheer the president\u2019s vow to build a wall and to expel undocumented migrants. Dozens of supporters gathered near the prototypes to greet him with American flags, red hats and signs saying \u201cSecure our border\u201d and \u201cBuild the damn wall\u201d. The visit is expected to play well with Trump supporters across the country who see California as a criminal-coddling, tax-hiking liberal dystopia. Californian Republicans running for Congress in November\u2019s midterm elections, however, are expected to steer clear of the president to avoid further alienating voters in tottering GOP redoubts. After inspecting the wall prototypes Trump addressed troops at the air station at Miramar. He bashed the media as fake news, prompting jeers for the travelling press corps, boasted about increased military spending, mused on building an outer \u201cspace force\u201d, and vowed the wall would become reality. \u201cPeople won\u2019t be able to come over it, the drugs will stop by a lot. We have two or three [prototypes] that really work.\u201d He did not mention Mexico paying for it. Later he was due to fly to LA to attend a $5m fundraiser for the Republican National Committee reportedly to be hosted at the Beverly Park mansion of Edward Glazer, whose family owns Manchester United and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Police sealed off parts of downtown in anticipation of protests by immigrant, LGBT and other advocacy groups. The White House seemed to stoke tension before the visit. Last week the justice department sued California, alleging it is interfering with the enforcement of immigration laws. The attorney general, Jeff Sessions, ratcheted up the temperature further by accusing the state\u2019s Democratic leaders of violating the constitution. Governor Brown shot back by calling Sessions a liar and accusing him of \u201cgoing to war\u201d with California. On Monday James Schwab, the San Francisco spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), a federal agency, resigned over what he described as \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cmisleading\u201d statements by Trump officials in relation to \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d supposedly evading arrest. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 March 2018. Gavin Newsom is lieutenant governor, not general as an earlier version said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
