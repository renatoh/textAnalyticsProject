The get-out would allow Rooney to move on should a bid of a set value be tabled by a rival club. Everton, who are hopeful they will edge out Portsmouth and Crystal Palace to sign Michael Carrick from West Ham, are likely to accept the proposal because it would provide them with a safety net of a guaranteed fee for the 18-year-old youth-team graduate over the course of the contract. It remains to be seen whether agreement can be reached between club and agent over the size of the striker's release clause, with Everton likely to seek a fee of around \u00a330m. That figure is based on how much compensation they might be awarded from an independent tribunal should Rooney - who, as he is aged under 24, would not be considered as a free agent - run down his current contract before moving on. Those estimates have suggested that, given the teenager's elevated status in the game, that level of compensation could be insisted on even in today's depressed transfer market. The forward's agents, the Formation Group, formerly known as Proactive Sports Management, are likely to seek a lower release clause so as not to deter potential buyers. Rooney has yet to decide whether to sign the new \u00a350,000-a-week five-year contract offered to him by Everton last month, though the club increasingly expect him to remain on Merseyside for the coming season, given that there have been no inquiries from rival clubs, and intend to press for a formal response on his future this week. The on-going boardroom dispute at Goodison Park between the chairman Bill Kenwright and the director Paul Gregg has deflected attention from Rooney's situation. The manager David Moyes admitted this week that the split in the club's hierarchy had \"interfered\" with the chances of tying the striker down to a long-term deal. Yet a troubled boardroom does not appear to have damaged Everton's chances of securing Carrick. A formal bid for the midfielder, capped twice by England, was lodged with West Ham yesterday and further talks between the clubs are expected today. \"We don't have enough bodies in the squad and we need to bring in players,\" said Moyes. \"We need players with the quality to step right into the Premiership and that means we have to spend cash.\" Portsmouth, who have loaned the Croatian striker Ivica Mornar to Rennes for the season, last night made a final offer worth around \u00a33m, based on appearances, for the 23-year-old."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
