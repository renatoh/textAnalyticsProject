Birmingham City are thought to be preparing a bid for the Republic of Ireland winger, who in the past has been valued at \u00a39m by Celtic. McGeady has made no secret of the fact he wants to test himself in the English Premier League at some stage in his career but Mowbray says such a move is not imminent. \"Aiden is very settled, enjoying his football immensely and hopefully looking forward to helping us win the title this year,\" said the Celtic manager. \"I sit here not expecting any bids, not anticipating any, not wanting any. Aiden is still a young boy who has to keep working on his game but he has God-given technical ability. \"He brings a different dimension to our team. Against teams who play with a lot of men behind the ball, his individuality can be the thing that unlocks the door. We are delighted he is performing at such a high level and hope he keeps doing so.\" Mowbray again admitted, though, that there will be departures from his squad in January. The former captain Stephen McManus, who has found himself out of the team in recent weeks, is among those who are likely to be courted by English clubs. \"If it's not hurting our football club, I'll allow that to happen if the funds are right,\" said Mowbray of potential sales. \"Players want to play on a Saturday. If they are not playing, there is a frustration.\" Mowbray dismissed any reported loan move for the Tottenham striker Robbie Keane. \"There is no scope for that,\" said the manager, referring to Keane's \u00a380,000-a-week wages. \"I don't envisage that happening unless certain individuals want to make that commitment.\" The Rangers striker Nacho Novo faces a date with the Scottish FA's disciplinary panel on 26 January after his actions when leaving the pitch at Aberdeen last month led to an improper conduct charge today. Novo was photographed lowering his shorts and aiming a one-fingered gesture towards Aberdeen supporters after a 1-0 defeat for Rangers at Pittodrie. The Spaniard will have his case heard at Hampden Park, with a fine or ban the most likely outcome."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
