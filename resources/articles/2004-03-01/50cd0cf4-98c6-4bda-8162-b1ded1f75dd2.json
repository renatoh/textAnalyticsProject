The right-back has worked under more managers there in 15 years than even Jesus Gil, the former Atletico Madrid president, might consider healthy. \"It's the big 10 now,\" Dodd says. \"Someone was winding me up earlier: 'You should be in the Guinness book of records for the most managers at one club.'\" Record or otherwise, Dodd might feel the need for a Guinness when he considers Ryan Giggs has been at Manchester United for a similar period and played under one manager. The affable 33-year-old laughs off his record in outstaying everyone from Chris Nicholl to Gordon Strachan. Yet Southampton cannot have spent more wisely than the \u00a350,000 they paid Bath City for Dodd. \"I've been waiting for someone to come in and say: 'Come on Doddsy, you've had enough, bugger off,'\" the former England under-21 international says with a smile. \"But luckily I've got on great with every manager and enjoyed training with them all. I'm just hoping I can continue my good run. \"It's strange for me to think I've had 10 managers. Ten in 15 years sounds a lot but it's only in the last few seasons that there's been a mad rush. You can't anticipate a manager [Strachan] wanting a break for health reasons. The circumstances with Dave Jones were best left to the chairman to sort out.\" Just over a year later Glenn Hoddle walked out. Sturrock intends to stick around longer and Dodd says first impressions are positive. Training for Liverpool's visit tomorrow started with defensive work before the emphasis switched to the attack. Scoring is Southampton's weak point and the team are being encouraged to send over plenty of crosses, get midfielders into the box and have the full-backs make a lot of overlapping runs. The \"challenge\" of winning over one more manager excites Dodd. He was glad to see an end to speculation about who might succeed Strachan, although Sturrock's appointment did not bring instant calm. The players were unsure what to expect when summoned to individual meetings by the former Scotland striker. \"You didn't know whether he was going to pull you in and say 'Thanks but no thanks,'\" Dodd says. \"Usually when you're called in to see the manager it's to be told you've been left out. When the first few lads came out, the rest were asking, 'What was he saying?' \"It turned out straightforward. He was just welcoming every player and wanted everyone to know we are all in the same position. We'd been working with him on the training ground but he wanted to talk to us one to one, which was a nice touch. He said he expects us to carry on the hard work Gordon left.\" A strong work ethic runs through Sturrock but he has a quirkier side, too. Several days before he met Southampton's squad he suggested publicly he would take them canoeing and mentioned he has made players work on building sites. \"We 'got to know' the new manager before we'd even met him,\" Dodd says. \"A few stories worried you a bit but we were raring to go. Steve Wigley did a fantastic job for two weeks but sometimes you do need the boss to lay down his authority and stamp his ideas.\" Dodd had a clue what to expect by speaking to Neil Heaney and Nicky Banger, former colleagues who have worked under Sturrock. \"Nicky said his man management and coaching were fantastic,\" Dodd says. \"He said he loves to be out on the training ground. Nicky's a centre-forward and said [Sturrock] loves his teams to score goals. In training that's what he wanted.\" After one league win in 10 games Southampton could do with completing a rare double over Liverpool. It was against them that Dodd made his home debut for the club in 1989. He was shaking at marking John Barnes but set up the first goal in a 4-1 win. \"Luckily I had senior players around me like Jimmy Case and Glenn Cockerill, who really just abused me for the rest of the season,\" he recalls. \"I think I played 20-odd games and I don't think I said 20 words.\" Speaking out ceased being a problem long ago but Dodd has never wanted to say goodbye. \"A lot of players who have gone elsewhere, maybe for more money, say they wish they hadn't left,\" he says. \"My family come from Bath, I've got relatives in Bournemouth. The people here are superb and we play in the Premier League. Why move on for the sake of it? I love it here.\" All that is missing is a winner's medal. Perhaps Sturrock will prove Dodd's perfect 10."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
