These long-lost radio sessions give some feeling of how they arrived in the peace'n'love era like a force-10 gale, with Radio 2's Jimmy Young commenting he'd \"never heard such a row in my life.\" Initially a \"travelling jukebox\" giving garage-punk-meets-psychedelic-rock treatments to songs from everyone from Fairport Convention to Janis Joplin, other tracks hint at what was to come. The second CD - a live broadcast in London - captures a band at the peak of their glam stomp, romping through Mama Weer All Crazee Now and the rest - with a roadie sitting in front of the drum kit to stop it moving - about to inspire everyone from the Sex Pistols to Oasis."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
