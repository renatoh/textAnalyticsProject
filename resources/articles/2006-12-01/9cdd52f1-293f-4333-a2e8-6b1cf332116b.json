So plenty of play on the gender-bending aspects of panto from the Shopping And Fucking author, then? Starring Only Fools and Horses star Roger Lloyd Pack as the dame Sarah the Cook, old-fashioned elements are promised, but, says Ravenhill, it will be as \"mucky as Charlotte Church on a Friday night\". The Hackney Empire also has a strong panto tradition. This year it's Cinderella (until January 13), but without the popular resident dame, Clive Rowe. Elsewhere children's stories take precedent over Cinders, Aladdin and co, and Nina Bawden's Carrie's War, about wartime evacuee children, is on at Lilian Baylis Theatre (until January 6), while over at the Lyric Hammersmith, Richard Adams's much-loved rabbity saga, Watership Down runs, skips and jumps until January 13. MC Flat Stanley Leeds Stanley Lambchop is an ordinary boy until he is squashed flat as a pancake when a bulletin board falls on him. OK, not flat as a pancake but about half an inch thick. That is thin enough to be posted to his friend in California, to be flown in the wind as a kite and to slip into the drains and see what's there. But what seems like fun at first soon begins to pall, and Stanley looks to be just a normal boy again. Based on Scott Nash's cult picture book, this co-production with the Polka Children's Theatre is written by Mike Kenny, and has an a cappella score. LG \u00b7 West Yorkshire Playhouse, to Jan 13 The Golden Goose Manchester For many theatres Christmas is, if not a golden goose, at least a cash cow that helps them balance the accounts for the rest of the year. This is fine as long as the family Christmas show is produced with the same artistic standards as the programme that happens over the rest of the year. That is certainly the case at the Library, where this year Charles Way tells the Grimm Brothers story about Dummling, who - for his kindness to a fairy - is given the reward of a golden goose. But good fortune sometimes leaves trouble in its wake... LG \u00b7 Library Theatre, to Jan 13 Pinocchio Northampton The reopened and refurbished Royal Theatre passed its first test with flying colours with an opening production of Stephen Sondheim's Follies, which had hardened theatre critics drooling. But now it faces the far sterner test of pleasing the local kids and their families with the annual Christmas show - this season a new version of Carlo Collodi's story about the adventures of a mischievous little wooden puppet who is determined to be a real boy. Lu Kemp's production goes back to the original Italian fairytale for its inspiration and boasts splendid puppetry as well as a live band playing junk instruments, and should successfully rescue the story from Disney-ification. All in all, it should be well worth poking your nose into. LG \u00b7 Royal Theatre, to Jan 13 London Round-Up London For those in search of more adult fare at this seasonal time, the Tricycle Theatre in Kilburn is staging Spice Drum Beat - Ghoema (until January 27) by David Kramer and Taliep Petersen. It tells of Cape history and culture, from the time when the Dutch first settled in South Africa to the beat of the ghoema drum. If it's chills you're after, then Hampstead's New End Theatre is the place to be (December 16 until January 6), where Nunkie Theatre Company present RM Lloyd Parry in A Pleasing Terror: Two Ghost Stories By MR James. Canon Alberic's Scrap-book and The Mezzotint are the two tales from the Victorian master of the ghost story. The Drill Hall has always come up with an alternative Christmas show, and this year Nona Shepphard has dispensed with frippery in The Marriage Bed - An Uncivil Partnership (until December 22), which questions the validity and reasoning of the gay \"marriage\". MC Guys And Dolls Birmingham When Nigel Harman came out of EastEnders, everyone thought he was just a pretty face. But he's proved his critics wrong, turning in a number of very good performances while playing in The Caretaker at Sheffield and starring in the West End in Michael Grandage's fine revival of Frank Loesser's musical about New York low life. Now he pops up in the role of high stakes gambler Sky Masterson again in Birmingham, playing opposite Bonnie Langford, who is forsaking the panto season to play Miss Adelaide, a role for which she was clearly born. Langford has always had difficulty shaking off her Violet Elizabeth Bott child star image, but she's a really fine musical comedy actress and she should deliver as Nathan Detroit's fiance, a woman who has been waiting for marriage for so long she has developed a cold. Guys And Dolls continues to play in the West End, but if this touring production is half as sizzling, it will warm the cockles of your heart. LG \u00b7 Alexandra Theatre, Tue 12 to Jan 6 Mother Goose Chipping Norton Tired of all those big commercial pantos with tired formulaic scripts and overpaid celebrities who can't act in the starring roles? Then look no further than the annual \"Chippy\" pantomime, which is the closest the modern theatre comes to a real, old-fashioned village panto. Staged in the lovely local theatre, this is a class act with a script by Radio 4 favourite Simon Brett, who produced the first episode of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, and original songs and music from Peter Pontzen, who has worked both with the NT and RSC. As traditional as mince pies and mulled wine, this avian adventure should fly high. LG \u00b7 Chipping Norton Theatre, to Jan 6 Wullie Whittington Glasgow Scotland takes its festive entertainment very seriously, offering some of the best pantos in Britain, with many productions providing a local twist to well-known tales. Now, for their fifth panto, the Tron Theatre Company takes the traditional tale of Dick Whittington, who found the streets of London paved with gold, and assigns it to Dick's second cousin - the apparently silly and talentless Wullie Whittington. Wullie arrives in George Square seeking fame and fortune, but unfortunately lacks Dick's resourcefulness. What's more, instead of a sly and helpful cat as a sidekick, he only has his pet sheep Baarbaaara, who is, quite frankly, a bit of a moo. Will all come good? Can a penniless, hopeless fool win the hearts and minds of the people of Glasgow? You know the answer as well as I do. Gordon Dougal directs a script he cowrote alongside Fletcher Mathers, while the ever-reliable Kenny Miller provides his always excellent designs.
