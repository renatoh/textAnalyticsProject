The manager was asked whether being so far behind was solely because Liverpool have dropped only two points or whether there may have been a slight subconscious drop in performance after winning the Premier League two years in a row. \u201cI would like to discover the reason for this big gap with Liverpool,\u201d he said. \u201cOne is, no doubt, the quality of the opponent. I repeat, one lost game in almost 60, the numbers are incredible. \u201cI expected that [City\u2019s performance level would dip] at the beginning of the season, after back-to-back titles.\u201d He said the defeat at Norwich exemplified that but that he had since been satisfied with performances. \u201cWhen I review all the games we\u2019ve played, even Norwich, we created [around] 20 shots. I know the stats, we are the best team by far at creating chances and the best team by far at conceding few. Much better than the opponents, but we are 11 points behind. \u201cSo something has happened. I tried to discover. Sometimes it\u2019s human; we can do better. We try to improve the next game. For example, in the last game [at Burnley], we scored an incredible four goals. But sometimes we miss goals from one metre and in the last game we shot in the corner from Gabriel [Jesus], two from out of the box from Riyad [Mahrez] and Rodri, and so sometimes it\u2019s difficult to find an explanation. But that\u2019s the truth \u2013 we\u2019re 11 points behind. There\u2019s something we missed and, honestly, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Guardiola endorsed Mikel Arteta to be his successor. His assistant is of interest to Arsenal and Everton, and Guardiola was asked whether Arteta could take over at City. \u201cHe is able to do that,\u201d he told Sky Sports. \u201cBut it depends on him, the club \u2013 many things that I cannot decide.\u201d Raheem Sterling has admitted he was not always \u201c100% committed\u201d to strive for excellence. The forward has been arguably City\u2019s best player this season, which follows last term\u2019s excellent campaign. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s all about mentality. Mentality, maturity and growing up. Now I\u2019m living for football. I\u2019m obsessed with football, obsessed with scoring goals, obsessed with recovering quicker, and obsessed with improving myself. You have every facility here so you have to use it to the best of your advantage to try and be the best you can be. I was decisive but I wasn\u2019t 100% committed. I wasn\u2019t 100% living the way I should be living to be a professional footballer and that would give me an edge on a match day. I realised that and changed it. \u201cYou see the improvements on the pitch and so that\u2019s why you continue to do it. Because you see how you feel on the field and what your output is. You look at what your numbers are doing. It\u2019s a good thing and as a professional you have to learn, take it in your stride and keep learning. That\u2019s all I do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
