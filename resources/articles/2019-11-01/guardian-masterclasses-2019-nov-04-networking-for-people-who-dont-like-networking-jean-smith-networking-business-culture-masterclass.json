Let\u2019s be honest: we all hate networking. It can incite anxiety and more often than not we find ourselves doing our best to circulate a room once and then make a swift exit. Fear of rejection, and feelings of awkwardness and uncertainty, are all valid reasons that can prevent us from making connections. And while we\u2019re being honest, you already know that networking is an essential skill when it comes to doing business, meeting a new romantic partner, and fostering personal and professional relationships. Social and cultural anthropologist Jean Smith will teach you the subtle \u2013 yet powerful \u2013 nuances that will make you a master of networking, without losing sight of who you are and what you stand for. She will show you essential techniques for making your next social event painless, useful and even fun. She will also take you through the five steps you can employ to make socialising easy, no matter the event. Whether you need to do it with industry professionals or you want to learn how to present yourself at a wedding at which you only know the bride, this practical masterclass will equip you with the necessary skills to turn awkward experiences into long-term relationships. Course content How to maximise your time at events, whether you\u2019re there for half an hour or all day Why mindset is key The first thing to do upon entering an event How to approach individuals and groups The perfect opener Moving on from small talk The anatomy of a good question Reading body language as a success monitor Building rapport The graceful exit Tutor profile Jean Smith is a social and cultural anthropologist.
