The deal signals the start of G\u00e9rard Houllier's attempt to strengthen his squad after missing out on the Champions League. Finnan is injured and has not travelled for the Republic of Ireland's Euro 2004 qualifiers, but there are no doubts over his long-term fitness. Liverpool's official website announced yesterday: \"The deal is expected to be completed tomorrow.\" Houllier made the 27-year-old right-back a prime target after losing confidence in Abel Xavier and Markus Babbel. Fulham will regard the transfer as good business, having bought Finnan from Notts County five years ago for only \u00a3200,000. Fulham recently announced big losses but Finnan's departure is not expected to precip itate the sale of other prized assets such as Sean Davis and Steed Malbranque. The club believe that pair are happy to play under Chris Coleman, though the board are keen to find buyers for Steve Marlet and Edwin van der Sar. Among Liverpool's remaining targets is at least one forward. Houllier is known to admire Damien Duff and Djibril Ciss\u00e9, the Auxerre forward who has a desire to move to Anfield but he has been told he will not be sold this summer. A mini play-off round in the middle of the 2006 World Cup finals holds the key to whether the tournament will expand from 32 to 36 teams. Brazil and Argentina are leading an ingenious South American campaign for expansion to make amends for Fifa horse-trading in December when they lost a place. The South Americans have until June 28, when Fifa meets in Paris on the eve of the Con federations Cup final, to swing voters on the all-powerful executive committee. The 32-team finals in France in 1998 and South Korea-Japan last year had eight first-round groups of four teams with the top two proceeding to the knock-out second round. Sceptics of expansion, including Fifa's president Sepp Blatter, consider the finals already long enough. The South American confederation has proposed an extra place for itself plus two for Europe - thus currying voting favour in Uefa - with the other to be decided in a play-off between Asia and Central-North America. The finals would start with nine mini-leagues of four. The nine winners would qualify for the 16-strong second round plus the five second-placed teams with the best records. The remaining two places would be settled by play-offs involving the remaining four second-placed teams."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
