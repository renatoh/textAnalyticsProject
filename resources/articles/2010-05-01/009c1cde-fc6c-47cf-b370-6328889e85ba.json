Here's the list so far: D Miliband, E Miliband, E Balls, John McDonnell, maybe Andy Burnham. Wake up at the back. Don't yawn. Things are looking up. We hear that if she can get the requisite 32 signatures from fellow MPs, Diane Abbott is minded to take her place alongside the David and the John and the Eds and have a tilt at the leadership. Michael Portillo might pine for her a bit on the sofa they share as part of on This Week. But think of the advantages; someone to flag up the shocking lack of gender equality in the campaign, someone to point out that Labour produced fewer minority MPs at the last election than the Tories. A standard-bearer for the left, amid fears that the party might lurch to the right. She wouldn't win, for a white, middle-class male it will be, and Diane isn't everyone's favourite. But that's not the point. She might drag the Dave, the Eds, the John and the Andy closer to worthwhile debate. \u2022 For there is already more to unite the declared candidates than to divide them. Everyone knows that the father of the Miliband brothers, Ralph, was a distinguished Marxist academic, known as Moribund to some admiring students. But fewer know that Balls's dad, Prof Michael Balls, is also a leftwing academic, a self-confessed Bennite. McDonnell's dad, by contrast, was a bus driver. One nil to him. \u2022 Austerity bites hard in Jeremy Hunt's Culture Department, where he and his team have spurned ministerial cars in order to save \u00a3250,000 a year. The car-free policy meant the minister walked to Buckingham Palace to be made a privy councillor and to pick up his seals of office last week. He brought them back in a rucksack. Even more spartan than his predecessor, Ben Bradshaw, we are told. He had the luxury of a bike. \u2022 With the wounds of defeat still fresh and a party divided, things are difficult in the Nick Griffin bunker these days. And harmony may be more elusive than ever after yesterday's appearance by Lee Barnes, the legal director, on the Voice of Africa radio station. Oh we love you Africans, Lee said. And the softsoap was going well until the presenter Space Clottey raised an Observer story, revealing that Barnes posted on his blog a video of the infamous police beating in Los Angeles of black motorist Rodney King. Added to the post was Lee's note saying the footage was \"brilliant\" and that he laughed each time he watched it. It's not about colour, said Barnes, flustered. It's about policing. I think anyone who gets caught drink-driving by the police deserves a good hiding. So does that also apply to your fellow BNP lieutenant Bob Bailey, who was convicted of drink-driving last year, the presenter asked him? Should the police have given him a good kicking? \"Well yes,\" said Griffin's legal adviser, trapped by his own strange logic. \"Totally.\" \u2022 To Sion College, an association of Anglican clergy in the diocese of London, originally founded in the 17th century. The annual feast occurred in Vintners' Hall this week. We are forced to endure such things. There's a new president every year and for the coming year she's the vicar of St Mary's, Primrose Hill. For the first time in the college's history its president is an American, and a woman: the Rev Marjorie Brown. Next year's president will also be a woman, a sequence which prompted a little male grumbling. Well, responded Marjorie, we are following 378 men. \u2022 Finally, think of Nicholas (aka Fatty) Soames, who has not only been complaining about the slowness of the count that increased his Mid Sussex majority to 7,402, but also about the new parliamentary rules regarding MPs' second properties. \"I hope people will be happy that I'll be significantly worse off,\" lamented Fatty, whose plight is barely impacted upon by the \u00a3350,000 he earns from three outside jobs. Where are the good folk of Mid Sussex in all this? What price a bit of empathy; a little charity?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
