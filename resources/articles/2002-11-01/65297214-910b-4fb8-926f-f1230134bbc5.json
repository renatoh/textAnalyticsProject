Shayler, 36, who remained seated throughout the sentencing, looked resigned as he stood up and was led from the dock at the Old Bailey. The trial judge, Mr Justice Moses, said the defendant had shown \"blinkered arrogance\" in committing the offences. Shayler was found guilty yesterday of disclosing information, documents and information from telephone taps in breach of the Official Secrets Act. The prosecution said he had potentially placed the lives of dozens of secret agents at risk. Today, the judge told Shayler he could be free after serving half his sentence. Mr Justice Moses said he had also taken into account the three-and-a-half months Shayler had spent in a French jail while the government tried unsuccessfully to extradite him. Shayler looked relieved as the judge announced the sentence straight away and told him to sit while he addressed his remarks to him. The judge said he was prepared to accept that Mr Shayler was motivated by a desire to expose what he thought was wrong - not by money. However, Mr Justice Moses added: \"Your own actions demonstrate a lack of any real insight into what you were doing or any intelligent foresight into its consequences. It is, contrary to your own belief, that blinkered arrogance which has led you here today.\" The former spy copied 28 files on seven topics, including several on Libyan links with the IRA and Soviet funding of the Communist party of Great Britain, before leaving MI5 in October 1996. The documents, some marked \"top secret\", were said to be \"chock-a-block\" with agents' names and other highly sensitive information. Jurors were allowed to see the weighty file of secret documents - but the names of agents and other ultra-sensitive information was blacked out. The 28 documents were handed to the Mail on Sunday newspaper, which paid Shayler \u00a340,000. The judge told Shayler he should be grateful to his girlfriend Annie Machon for removing an impression that he had made the disclosures in order to get into journalism. Earlier, Miss Machon, who gave her address as Osea Island, Essex, denied in court that her boyfriend was a self-publicist. She said Shayler believed his comments on the way the security services were run would lead to government action. \"He feels passionately about a number of fundamental issues,\" she added. Miss Machon, who left MI5 at the same time as Shayler, in October 1996, said they had both suffered from stress-related illnesses as a result of the last five years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
