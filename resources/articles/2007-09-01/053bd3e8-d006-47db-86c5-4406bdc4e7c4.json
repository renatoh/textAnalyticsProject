Have warmed up for their debut by losing to Canada, Japan and . . . London Welsh. In mitigation, Welsh get paid to play. Portugal don't. How they see it \"For us,\" says coach Tomaz Morais, \"we are already the champion team, because our World Cup was to get here.\" Tell that to New Zealand. Romania are the target. The coach Morais has 22 caps, as a centre, and a nomination as the IRB's coach of the year for 2004. He's also in charge of the sevens team which is a regular and respected presence on the IRB circuit. The captain Vasco Uva is a solid, inspirational and extravagantly-bearded presence at No8. If he gets lonely his brother, Goncalo, is at lock (as one of three French-based professionals, with Montpellier) and cousin Joao is at openside flanker. The linchpin Diogo Mateus, a 27-year-old centre, practised tackling the likes of Scotland's Rob Dewey - which isn't easy - while on Munster's books last year. Now back with OS Belenenses, his brief Magners League experience will be priceless. How they'll play Like they did in the second leg of their final qualifier in Montevideo - tackle, tackle and tackle again. And then tackle a bit more. And hope that fly-half Duarte Pinto kicks any penalties that pop up along the way. Key fact After beating Uruguay 24-23 on aggregate to qualify, six of the squad were briefly locked up when their celebrations produced an altercation with local police. Omen Portugal's last World Cup meeting with the Scots ended in a 5-0 win. OK, so it was a football match, in qualifying for USA 94, but they'd happily take the same again.
