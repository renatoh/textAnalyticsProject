The forward's present deal with the club expires at the end of the season and United have been dragging their feet on splashing out the required \u00a332m to make his stay permanent. \"I am not preoccupied about my future,\" said the Argentina international yesterday. \"My instincts are to stay with the club and in the next week or so I think there will be more contact with regard to sorting out my contract. This is what I have been told. \"My agent has been in touch with United all the time and he tells me that everything is very positive now. So it is up to the club. Other clubs have asked about me but I see my future at United.\" Cristiano Ronaldo started the new year by attempting to quash one of the most protracted transfer sagas of 2008. The winger has been repeatedly linked with a move to Real Madrid but in an interview on the club website yesterday he said his heart remains at Old Trafford. \"What people are saying now [the recent speculation about an agreement with Real Madrid] is not true,\" said the 23-year-old. \"Who says that is a liar, because I am happy at the club. I want to stay here, I feel at home here.\" He added that Sir Alex Ferguson was a crucial figure in his career. The Portugal international is confident that he will be back to his best as the club challenges to win four major trophies this season. \"I am fine. I have scored some important goals. I have improved and genuinely believe I can have a season as good as the last one or even better. I am the same player. I work hard and play hard and I aim to score many, many more goals.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
