A few minutes later a stroller pushed along by a young woman rolls past, carrying a brindle-cross. That afternoon a puppy wearing a tuxedo and rainbow bowtie is wheeled through the heaving crowds of the Taipei Pride parade. Dogs in prams are a common sight in Taiwan\u2019s capital, where the city\u2019s metro system allows pets on board only if they are in contained carriers. But observers say the trend goes beyond the practical and reflects changing attitudes towards pet ownership and a growing propensity for \u201cfur babies\u201d amid a declining birthrate in Taiwan. Taiwan\u2019s birthrate is among the lowest in Asia, and is due to delayed marriages, analysts say. Having children outside of marriage is still socially unacceptable, and economic barriers to having children include minimal maternity leave entitlements. At the same time, pet ownership is skyrocketing. In September analysts estimated the number of Taiwanese pets had overtaken the number of children aged under 15. As a result the pet accessory retail market is booming, and was worth US$1.52bn a year in 2015, according to Taiwan\u2019s pet expo. Market research firm Euromonitor International said it has continued to grow ever since. A spokeswoman for pet pram manufacturer, Ibiyaya, said sales had increased more than five-fold between 2002 and 2015, and it was still growing, with more suppliers coming on to the market. \u201cThe industry is getting more competitive while customers have more options when it comes to choosing the right pet stroller for their fur kids,\u201d she said. Strollers, sunglasses, raincoats and even socks for dogs are also increasingly common. Wu Hung, the executive director of the Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan (East), worries that the desire for these items stem from \u201can anthropocentric way of thinking about animals and treat them as accessories for human fulfilment, rather than focusing on the animal\u2019s needs\u201d. \u201cThis can lead to serious welfare problems when the best interests of the animal are overlooked.\u201d Hung said it was \u201cheartening\u201d to see a growing number of positive interactions between humans and animals, and strollers were good for improving the life of old or disabled animals, and getting them through busy urban areas, but they still needed exercise. In Da\u2019an Forest Park, Syin and Han are wheeling their two dogs and cat to the vet. Syin says they usually walk the dogs around the park on leashes, but today they\u2019re in a hurry. \u201cThey still get exercise. This is for convenience so you can take them on the subway and to restaurants.\u201d Syin says they grew up with lots of animals around them, but she\u2019s seen the rate of pet ownership grow, especially the younger generations. \u201cThe first thing that comes to mind, is we don\u2019t want to have children,\u201d says Syin, when asked why. \u201cYou spend more money, you have more responsibility. Even though we have to spend money and have responsibility for [our pets], but children are \u2026 I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not a baby person,\u201d she laughs. Tom Parker, a UK citizen, Taiwan resident and owner of a Boston Terrier named Ben\u00e9, says his wife makes him shelter their dog under an umbrella when it rains, but if she\u2019s not around the dog gets wet. \u201cDogs in Taiwan are pampered and well cared for, but can also be an accessory to show off, and the more portable the better,\u201d he says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
