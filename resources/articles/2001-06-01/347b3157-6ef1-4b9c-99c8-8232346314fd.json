However, some of its national executive are angry about the proposals, saying the cuts will marginalise further education colleges and campaigns for gender, sexual and racial equality. The national women's officer, Kat Fletcher, said a unit designed to promote the interest of women had been scrapped. She added the union's proposal that less active student bodies are not sent all NUS mailings will mean poorer unions, which can not participate in national conferences and other forums, are left out of the loop. \"Universities and FE colleges just setting up unions will not get the NUS support they need to develop,\" said Ms Fletcher. \"We are very angry and are holding a picket at the next meeting to complain.\" However, a spokesman for the union denied the allegations, saying nothing had been scrapped, but that those employed by the women's unit were being asked to help on campaigns for black and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transexual students. The spokesman added some of the hundreds of unions around the country only affiliate to the NUS to get student cards, and do not want to receive political mailings. Today's furore arises out of the union's efforts to settle its debts. Although some executive members have argued the union will not be so badly overdrawn once all universities' contributions are received, others admit the union is \u00a3300,000 over budget."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
