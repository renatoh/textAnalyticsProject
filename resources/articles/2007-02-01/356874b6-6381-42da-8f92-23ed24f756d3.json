The two Algerians being held are shortly to be joined by others who have been driven out of this country by ongoing pressure put on them by the British government (Row as judges back Blair in key terror case, August 25, 2006). They have never been charged or interviewed by the police and their lawyers have not been able to see evidence against them. All have been keen to come before a properly constituted court of law in order to answer any charge that the government may want to bring against them. The suggestion made by Alex Carlisle, the government's independent monitor of terrorism, that the men returned voluntarily is to play along with the government's facade of justice. The voluntary nature of the return to Algeria needs to be set against the psychological torture these individuals were being forced to endure in this country. Amnesty International has already issued an alert. We would like to emphasise to the British and Algerian governments that the eyes of the world are now on the fate of these men.
