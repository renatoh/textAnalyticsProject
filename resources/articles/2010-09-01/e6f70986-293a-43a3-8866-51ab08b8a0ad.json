But that is a measure of their state of mind ahead of Saturday's visit to Manchester City and the hosting of Arsenal eight days later, fixtures Florent Malouda has described as the team's \"opportunity to prove we are the champions.\" The Frenchman was in prickly mood after the 4-0 win over Blackpool on Sunday, when it was put to him that the club's 100% record after five league games, during which they have scored 21 goals, was little proof of their credentials given the less-than-stellar standard of the opposition they have faced. \"Everyone talks about the City game because they do not give us credit for what we have done so far this season,\" said Malouda, referring to what should be Chelsea's first significant challenge since winning the title in May. But with more time to reflect, Malouda accepts that for Chelsea, league leaders as well as holders, the hard work does indeed start now. \"Lots of people see these two games as a test and we are ready. It could be an opportunity for us to prove we are the champions and that we are prepared for any kind of opposition. There'll be a lot of pressure, but we have to use our experience and stay calm. Our only objective is to get points.\" The desire to impress at the weekend is fuelled further by memories of City's wins home and away against Carlo Ancelotti's side last season and an acknowledgement that, having been further bolstered by the millions of Sheikh Mansour, the team have now developed into genuine title contenders. City currently sit fourth, seven points behind Chelsea but having already faced Tottenham and Liverpool. \"They [City] are getting better and have bought some top-quality players,\" added Malouda. \"Last year's games against City were difficult for us and that could be an extra motivation for us. It will be a tactical game. Knowing their manager [Roberto Mancini], they have probably seen our games and seen that we can go away and pick up points. Their players will also see this as a chance to show they are ready to fight for the title. But we will defend our title at any price.\" That Malouda should be the one speaking such words on Chelsea's behalf would seem an unlikely twist to anyone able to recollect how the player struggled to establish himself at the club upon joining from Lyon for \u00a313.5m in July 2007. He scored just four times in a debut season interrupted by the departure of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho as manager and while his tally improved to nine the following campaign, first under the control of Lui Felipe Scolari and then Guus Hiddink, it was felt at the start of last season that his time in west London was nearing an end. But Malouda stayed and shone, scoring 15 goals as Chelsea completed their first league and FA Cup double, and while he then went on to be part of France's disastrous World Cup campaign, the forward has, if anything, improved further this season. The two goals he scored against Blackpool have taken Malouda's tally to seven in all competitions, making him the club's outright top-scorer and the Premier League's joint top-scorer. Malouda, who lines up on the left of Chelsea's three-man attack, is confident he can continue to play an influential role, but it is the man who plays in the centre of that trio who he feels will eventually score the bulk of their goals. \"At the end of the season I'm sure [Didier] Drogba will be far in front of me,\" he said. \"I can compete but not for a very long time. It's a pleasure for me [to be part of the team] and I just want to enjoy that. Playing in a team that is winning games and scoring goals is what we train hard for and that is what we must keep doing.\" Chelsea host Newcastle United in the Carling Cup tomorrow, moreover, although Ancelotti has already confirmed he will rest the bulk of his first-team for that tie ahead of the sterner challenges likely to come."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
