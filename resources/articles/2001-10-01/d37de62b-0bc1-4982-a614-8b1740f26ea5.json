Employers with five staff or more must offer their staff access to the scheme by October 8. Many employees will already be in a group pension plan, and if it is one where the employer provides contributions along with your own, then this is a valuable perk. But what happens if you are in a group pension plan that you are not happy with? If you are unhappy with the performance of the scheme you are in should you insist on a transfer, perhaps to a lower-cost stakeholder plan? And will you be penalised for this? This is the dilemma facing Sara Cooper, managing director of a Leeds-based fitness publishing company, Human Kinetics, which employs 15 staff. On top of a hectic schedule, she has recently taken on responsibility for running her company's money purchase pension scheme. It is proving an uphill struggle. \"We have been with Scottish Widows for 12 years, but since their merger with Lloyds TSB [earlier this year] the service has been terrible,\" says Ms Cooper. \"It can take three months to receive a response to a letter. We receive no advice and the adviser meant to be dealing with our case has gone missing. \"The problems are wide ranging. Money has been debited from employees who have left. Phone calls we have made have been ignored. It is almost impossible to receive literature from them.\" Ms Cooper says she is also concerned about Scottish Widows' performance. Since the merger with LloydsTSB, there has been an exodus of staff and many investors are unhappy with the returns their funds have been producing. The Human Kinetics scheme is a fairly generous one. The company makes a 6% contribution, which rises to 7% at five years of service and 8% at 10 years. Employees can top this up with their contributions if required. Although Scottish Widows was contacted, they have yet to respond. To find out what the experts think, Guardian Unlimited Money asked a range of financial advisers what Ms Cooper should do. Here's what they said: Seek independent advice \"It's absolutely vital to take professional advice from someone who understands how your scheme is set up,\" says Steve Pocock, pensions strategy manager for Norwich Union. However, some advisers will charge and this is something to consider. Find out about exit charges and other penalties \"I think many of the front-end charges with this Scottish Widows' plan will have been paid up, so switching should not be excessively costly. I also understand the company has brought in stakeholder-friendly charges for its previous plans and so this should not be too much of a problem,\" says Nigel Chambers, managing director with IFA Alexander Forbes. Look for a provider with a choice of funds You may just want to switch funds rather than provider. Some providers only offer a narrow choice of funds with their stakeholder plans. Others are more flexible. Norwich Union, for example, offers a choice of six for those buying direct and up to 40 for those buying through an IFA. Look for security The failure of Equitable Life to set aside sufficient funds to meet its obligations raises many questions. Again an adviser should be able to offer reassurance on this matter. \"People are worried this could happen again. One of the main companies I have been recommending is Standard Life, which is Europe's largest mutual,\" says Andrew Holloway, principal of IFA Aldenhart Financial Services. Service matters - but have realistic expectations The 1% cap on charges means insurers will try and cut corners when it comes to personal attention. Michelle Cracknell points out that Friends Provident, for example, offers clients the option of checking and amending scheme details online, which can prove convenient for both parties. What is the fund manager's retention record like? If Sara Cooper decided to switch, she will join larger clients such as TUFM, which provides pensions for trade union workers, and the Port of London Authority. Both have left following the Lloyds TSB takeover. But, there are still advisers prepared to expect better things of Scottish Widows. Sean McCabe of IFA Chartwell says: \"Lloyds TSB has plenty of cash. There are often problems following a takeover and I believe they will be trying to put things right. It could be worth looking at changing the funds and waiting a while longer before switching to a new provider.\" Check out past performance It is too early to judge which stakeholder plans are going to be the market leaders. Not only is the stock market in dire straits, but most are too new to make comparisons. But, you can look at what's happened in the past. \"I know Scottish Widows is nothing spectacular right now,\" comments Andrew Holloway, \"I would be following the company's plans to improve matters carefully.\" Review your options The overall view is that Ms Cooper should look carefully at her options. Switching to another provider appears realistic, but should not be undertaken without advice. According to research by pensions experts Punter Southall &amp; Co, 90% of employers are not planning to contribute to stakeholder schemes, so employees in existing occupational pension plans will have to think carefully before considering a transfer. Punter Southall said yesterday that some employers may use a stakeholder as an excuse to offer new employees access to a less generous scheme than their existing final salary schemes. \"In light of ongoing troubles in equity markets and low interest rates I think we will see, in the long term, many final salary schemes closing to new members and companies using the stakeholder alternative as the designated arrangements for new members,\" said Punter Southall's David Segal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
