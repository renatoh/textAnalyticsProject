This week's Science Weekly is dedicated to exploring the burning question that is the subject of Duncan Clark and Mike Berners-Lee's new book: how to leave vast untapped reserves of coal, gas and oil in the ground, and somehow find viable alternative forms of energy. Adam Vaughan, the Guardian's online environment editor, interviewed Clark, who is a consultant editor on the environment desk and visiting researcher at the UCL Energy Institute, and Berners-Lee, a leading expert on carbon emissions and the author of How Bad Are Bananas? The Carbon Footprint of Everything. To buy a copy of The Burning Question from the Guardian bookshop, click here. Subscribe for free via iTunes to ensure every episode gets delivered.
