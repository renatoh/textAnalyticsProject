Ferdy Murphy's chaser, who won the William Hill Handicap Chase at Cheltenham last month, needs just two withdrawals from the top of the handicap to sneak in at the bottom of the weights with 10st 2lb. \"We always try to take them to Redcar before a big race as it just freshens them up and it's a day away from the yard,\" Murphy said yesterday. \"You do get excited about having a horse like him. He's definitely got the best chance of any of my previous National runners.\" Joes Edge is top-priced 9-1 with Ladbrokes and any bets will be refunded if he does not get into the race at the final declaration stage this morning.
