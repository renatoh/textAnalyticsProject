He began the year with a physical altercation with Australia's vice-captain Michael Clarke during the Sydney Test. Clarke had wanted to sing the Australian team song, Under The Southern Cross, before 11pm so he could spend the night with his fianc\u00e9e Laura Bingle. Katich wanted to sing it at a decently late hour. He takes life seriously. At the Swalec Stadium, England felt the full force of Katich's deadly earnestness. It would have been galling enough to concede Ashes hundreds to both Katich and Ricky Ponting with the series only two days old. It was even more dispiriting when they appeared to be synchronised. A Katich hundred is a draining experience. This was less Under The Southern Cross than Under The Katich Cosh, punishment by on drives and off-side nudges. He has no sense of smell after an attack of glandular fever, but he can still sniff a batting opportunity. \"It is day two of a Test, the wicket is good, we put a high price on our wickets and we didn't take too many risks,'' he said. He spoke as he batted, with unerringly cold logic. His partnership with Ponting resumes today, 189 runs to the good. Wales had anticipated a chance to watch the Australian wonderkid, Phillip Hughes, a batsmen of brash originality. Instead they watched, or half-watched, Katich absorbed in orthodoxy. Hughes reveals his off-stump in a manner that Katich must regard as disrespectful. On the last tour it was suggested that Katich wrote poetry. Few people have ever seen it. He bats in prose. Dense prose at that. Ashes tours have not always been so kind to Katich. He played only once in 2001, at Headingley. Four years later, as England recovered the Ashes, he made only two half-centuries and was dismissed by Andrew Flintoff four times. When Australia dropped him Bob Simpson, a former Australia coach, came to the rescue. \"Last time around I wasn't hitting the ball well and I was struggling to hit the ball straight. I owe great thanks to Bob,\" he said. \"I guess batting at the top of the order has helped me. When I got a chance to open in the West Indies I jumped at it because that is where I have been most comfortable during my career. \"In the past 12 months I have felt that I have a role to play in this team as an experienced player with a lot of young guys around. Time catches up with all of us but it is nice to be able to pass that experience on.\" Flintoff almost pulled off a cracking low return catch when Katich was on 10. Graeme Swann was convinced that he had him lbw on 56. He reached his hundred with one of his most authoritative shots, middling a pull off Flintoff, his nemesis of four years ago. \"You know with Freddie that he is going to keep coming at you all day. He is a great competitor. They look to him to make those breakthroughs when nothing much is happening.\" Much has been made over the past decade and more of the adventurous way that Australia have played their Test cricket, an approach that was held to have transformed the game. This summer England must rid themselves not only of Katich, but of Michael Hussey and Marcus North. Katich might be in the mood for a song late at night; if this persists all summer, not many in England will feel like joining him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
