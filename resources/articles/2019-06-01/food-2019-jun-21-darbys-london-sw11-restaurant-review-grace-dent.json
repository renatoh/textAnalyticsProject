The Hoist nightclub, for example, despite serving prime, leather-wrapped beefcake, never offered sustainably sourced small plates. Likewise, no one ever joined the 2am queue at Br\u00fct in search of a pleasant souffl\u00e9. For these reasons, and more, Vauxhall seemed a peculiar place for the Americans to unveil their shiny new embassy back in January 2018. Until then, our American friends were ensconced in a highly desirable Mayfair spot where US diplomats could choose from a host of local Michelin-starred restaurants \u2013 Kai, Murano, Umu, Gymkhana \u2013 without the need for a motorcade, or adding to their government\u2019s current \u00a312m in unpaid congestion charges. Regardless, the American attach\u00e9s and envoys now find themselves a 10-minute walk from Vauxhall station, in a gargantuan, purpose-built, space-age fortress set 100ft back from the road, prettified by ornamental ponds, yet essentially resembling a cross between the Pompidou Centre and the Premier Inn Reading Central. Bringing some decorum to this mel\u00e9e are the Gills, known for The Dairy and Sorella in nearby Clapham, and well-respected among food types for genuine, heartfelt, hard-earned reasons. Yet while The Dairy is fancy-modern and Sorella tipsy-Italian, Darby\u2019s is a culinary bear hug for Robin\u2019s dad, the late jazz musician Earl Darby Gill. It\u2019s a nod of the head to Gill Sr\u2019s adventures while playing trumpet in Chicago and New York in the 1950s and 60s. Darby\u2019s is an Irish-American eating palace that serves a fine yet wholly non-befuddling menu that features Dooncastle oysters and Guinness, native lobster brioche roll with roe mayo, grilled Dexter sirloin with green peppercorn sauce, pappardelle with veal rag\u00f9 and gildas made with smoked eel (and called \u201clittle perverts\u201d on the menu). On my first glance at the list, my eyes lingered on the fresh brown butter waffle with Exmoor caviar, Secret Smokehouse salmon and cultured cream. This is a menu you could whisper into someone\u2019s ear as a niche form of ASMR therapy. Croissant with tonka bean ice-cream. \u201cSeriously buttery\u201d potato mash. How about turbot in seaweed butter with a side of buttered jersey royals with soft herbs? Do you want me to stop now? Did I mention the Tia Maria affogato? Darby\u2019s is one to have up your sleeve for a multitude of eventualities: crowds, client dinners and date nights alike. It\u2019s a large space with subdued lighting and high ceilings. It\u2019s classy, with fast, excellent, knowledgeable service. There\u2019s a bakery, an oyster bar, an open grill and a large sun terrace. But what is it like to eat dinner here on a Friday night in the shadow of the American embassy? Is it full of full-throated Trump fans demanding their steak well done and their portions bigly? No, it is not like that at all. Darby\u2019s reminded me of good, elegant but boozy dinners I\u2019ve had in Washington DC, where people arrived perhaps intending to talk politics but had forgotten all about that by the second martini. From 5pm until 7pm, six Blackwater Wilds oysters and a pint of Guinness will cost you a tenner. A decadent, airy cloud of well-seasoned chicken liver mousse with an unforgettable jerusalem artichoke and truffle \u201cjam\u201d is \u00a312. Fresh slices of fig and walnut sourdough arrived with melted, truffled Baron Bigod, which may well be Britain\u2019s greatest soft cheese. Darby\u2019s winning formula may be a well-worn one, but it\u2019s one that never bores me: and that is simply to take incredible produce and serve it carefully. Or, as Gill puts it on the restaurant website: \u201cOur single philosophy is: \u2018We have a wonderful product, let\u2019s try not to feck it up.\u2019\u201d A plate of dayboat monkfish fillet, again in seaweed butter, is heroically good. A side of crisp, beef-fat potatoes turns out to be those thick, crisp, SpongeBob SquarePants-shaped, concertina-style slices of heaven. Two glasses of chablis down, I declared: \u201cThis is my favourite restaurant this year.\u201d \u201cBut you said that about Xier,\u201d Charles said. \u201cA woman can change her mind,\u201d I replied, while pushing that affogato into my flip-top head, slightly high on the potent shot of espresso poured over malted milk ice-cream. I left Darby\u2019s so jubilant that even the armed security guards holding semi-automatic 10-inch-barrel gas-piston-operated rifles outside the embassy seemed like \u201ca great bunch of lads\u201d. Thanksgiving started early. God bless the USA. \u2022 Darby\u2019s 3 Viaduct Gardens, London SW11, 020-7537 3111. Open lunch Tues-Sun, noon-3pm (4.30pm Sun), dinner Tues- Sat 6-9.30pm.
