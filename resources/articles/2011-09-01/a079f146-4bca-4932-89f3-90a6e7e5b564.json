Yet there it was, introducing the report in another newspaper of Stoke City's thumping victory over FC Thun in the Europa League last month. This was almost as big a shock as the sight of Shaun Wright-Phillips scampering past Newcastle defenders to set up chance after chance for his new Queens Park Rangers team-mates in their goalless draw with Newcastle United a week ago. Here we have two players long ago written off as hopeless cases. Pennant, tagged \"the most expensive teenager in English football\" after his move from Notts County to Arsenal a dozen years ago, could be found half a dozen years later wearing a tag of a very different kind in Birmingham City's matches while on probation from a jail term following a drink-driving conviction. As for Wright-Phillips, I lost count long ago of the number of times, while sitting in the press box at Wembley, Stamford Bridge or the City of Manchester Stadium, that I hurled down my pencil or slammed the lid of the laptop and groaned as a promising move ended with yet another example of his seemingly congenital inaccuracy. What these two have in common is that they are both wingers who promised to succeed at the highest level, yet fell badly short of expectations. As such, they take their place in a long line of wide men that began with some of the earliest English players of African-Caribbean ancestry to make an impact on the domestic game in the 1970s and '80s. It is a list that would include Laurie Cunningham, Mark Chamberlain, Vince Hilaire, Franz Carr, Mark Walters, Danny Wallace and Tony Daley. Only John Barnes, with 79 England caps and more than 300 league games in a great Liverpool team, could be said to have fulfilled his promise. The others in the list, all of whom represented England at junior levels, collected exactly 23 senior caps between them. Until his move to Stoke last year, Pennant seemed to have been lost for years. During spells at Arsenal, Liverpool, Birmingham and Portsmouth, his career was corroded by a succession of the sort of tabloid expos\u00e9s that provide those whose job it is to keep young footballers on the straight and narrow with a plentiful supply of cautionary tales involving glamour models and wrecked Mercedes-Benzes. Beneath the headlines was the story of a boy born in a desperately unfavoured district of Nottingham, whose mother died when he was three, who spent his own childhood helping to bring up his three younger siblings, who never learnt to read or write properly, and whose father was jailed three years ago for selling heroin and crack. The Pennant anecdote everybody knows is the one about the discovery, a few months after his return from a year with Real Zaragoza to join Stoke on loan, of his Porsche abandoned at a Spanish airport car park, covered with dust and parking tickets. What image could more exquisitely symbolise the blatant, heedless hedonism of the overpaid, overindulged, undereducated modern English footballer? No such notoriety blemishes the career of Wright-Phillips: just a lingering sense of disappointment. After assuaging the pain of rejection as a teenager at Nottingham Forest by establishing himself as a favourite with Manchester City's fans while the club climbed back from the abyss to the top tier, he failed to shoulder the burden of a \u00a321m fee at Chelsea \u2013 or that of an \u00a38m return to City \u2013 and was never quite able to turn 36 senior caps into a robust international career. It should be noted that Stoke and QPR are two clubs with a bit of history when it comes to the rehabilitation of the game's troubled or underachieving artists, and now Tony Pulis and Neil Warnock seem to be doing for Pennant and Wright-Phillips what Tony Waddington and Gordon Jago did for Alan Hudson and Stan Bowles almost 40 years ago. For certain players who cannot quite live with exposure on the very grandest stage, a slightly more modest level sometimes provides the environment in which an exceptional talent can flourish. For these two, that opportunity may have come just in time. Crutchlow can feel proud of leaving Rossi in his wake Cal Crutchlow, Britain's only rider in the current MotoGP series, has some work to do if he is to stay in the series next year, since the best result after 14 of the 18 races in his debut season remains a seventh place in Barcelona back in June. In years to come, however, he will be able to look on last Sunday's Grand Prix of Aragon with special pride, for it was the day on which he beat Valentino Rossi to the finishing line by less than a fifth of a second. Admittedly it was only for ninth place, at a time when Rossi is struggling to achieve any kind of competitiveness in his first season with the Ducati team, but Rossi is still Rossi, a nine-times world champion and a legend of his sport, fighting hard to get himself back into a position to reclaim his crown. The 25-year-old from Coventry can be proud of taking his scalp, even if only for a day. Will Prior's Porsche have vintage value? With its swooping coachwork by H J Mulliner, the R-type Bentley Continental of the early 1950s is the most elegant of grand touring cars, equally at home gliding down the Autoroute du Soleil or sweeping through the Grace gates at Lord's. Bonhams sold one at the Goodwood Revival last Friday: a lovely pale grey example, owned early in its life by Godfrey Evans, the great English wicketkeeper, before being sold to \"Lord Ted\" Dexter, who enjoyed its company for a decade. It went for \u00a3290,250, worth every penny if you like that sort of thing. I wonder how much, in 40 or 50 years' time, someone will fork out for Matt Prior's Porsche, the one of which the current England stumper spoke to Sachin Tendulkar at Trent Bridge four summers ago? Think outside the box, Ben \"Being on tour is very intense and you do need to be able to go out, within reason,\" Ben Youngs wrote in his newspaper column on Saturday, responding to criticism of the England rugby squad's preferred mode of relaxation in New Zealand. \"I couldn't sit in my room all the time playing Xbox.\" So those, then, are the alternatives: getting hammered in a dodgy bar, or playing a video game. It must be a great life."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
