Yet at its heart, it is so simple. As Thomas Henry Huxley famously lamented, \"How extremely stupid not to have thought of that.\" Darwin discerned that differences were heritable. Small, incremental improvements could be passed from generation to generation and changes could be accumulated, leaving the starting point far behind. Perhaps Huxley would have been even more self-critical considering that this was nowhere more evident than in the species on which we most depend \u2013 our crops. Little wonder then, that the first chapter of Darwin's monumental On the Origin of Species was entitled Variation under domestication. Unlike wild species, crops are domesticated. Their fitness, their evolution, is in our hands and, as Sir Otto Frankel put it, \"we have acquired evolutionary responsibility\". Darwin understood that populations that made appropriate and successful adaptations survived and that those that didn't perished, and that agricultural crops were not exempt. He noted, for example, that certain crop varieties \"withstand certain climates better than others\" and in Origin, outlined a screening and breeding experiment, suggesting that someone sow kidney beans: So early that a very large proportion are destroyed by frost, and then collect seed from the few survivors, with care to prevent accidental crosses, and then again get seed from these seedlings, with the same precautions. Plant breeders are essentially doing this today on a large scale and with many crops. Drawing on the huge diversity of seed samples stored in gene banks, breeders expose plants to different conditions (heat, drought, a new disease) to find the adaptive traits for producing the new varieties that farmers will grow in the future. But if this genetic diversity is not conserved, if we lose the ability to make and accumulate those small changes so central to evolution, we will have removed one of Darwin's essential pillars of evolution \u2013 variation \u2013 and will have rendered selection impotent. Climate change, and other pressures on our food supply intensify daily. Agriculture needs to respond with crop varieties adapted and ready to meet these challenges. There is no scientific obstacle to conserving the diversity of our crops, but the world's gene banks remain chronically underfunded. What better way to commemorate Darwin's life and work than guaranteeing that agriculture's evolutionary process can continue? Barack Obama, in his inaugural address, said \"What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility \u2026 This is the price and promise of citizenship.\" For the world's food supply, good global citizenship requires us to embrace our \"evolutionary responsibility\". It remains to be seen whether we are prepared to pay its price."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
