That should have been C-46 transports. The article also said that \"until oil was found in 1967 at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska was largely inhabited by native peoples\". In fact, the flow of incomers had tipped the balance against the native inhabitants well before the 1960s (12 August, page 29). \u2022 We said that it was Wilfred who, in the Walter Scott novel Ivanhoe, split the arrow of an adversary (How Merrie England \u2013 and Disney \u2013 owe everything to an unloved Scot, 17 August, page 13).
