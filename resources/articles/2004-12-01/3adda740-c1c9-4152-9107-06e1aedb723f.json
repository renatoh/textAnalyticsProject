The worrying statistic emerged in Abbey's Saving Insight report, which also revealed that 71% of the nation's homeowners are relying on the rising value of their home as a substitute for long-term savings. At the same time, 60% admit they do not save money regularly - which equates to 28 million Britons not saving money for their future, Abbey estimates. The research, conducted for Abbey by leading think-tank The Future Foundation, follows a recent Pensions Commission report which warned that some 12 million people could end up poorer than the rest of society because they are not saving enough. Abbey's research shows that 47% of homeowners now have a mortgage that extends into retirement, a figure that has almost doubled since 1992 when it was 26%. The survey also showed that 80% of lower income households who own their own home are relying on it as an investment for old age compared with 60% of higher income families. Just a third of all savers take advantage of ISA tax-free savings and almost the same amount invest in shares (32%). There has been a very gradual increase in the number of savers over the last 12 years, but the increase has been so small that if it were to continue at the same rate for the next five years, only 44% of Britons would be savers by 2009. Based on this prediction, the UK would not have a majority of the population saving until 2035. Saving for special events (7%) still comes higher up the list than saving for a house (6%). Short term savings goals such as a holidays (24%) are more popular than a private pension (15%), or children's future (4%). Angus Porter, Abbey's customer director said, \"Despite our findings, it's not all doom and gloom. At Abbey, we're seeing a big increase in the number of people opening savings accounts, but there's clearly a lack of saving for the longer term and the balance is all wrong. \"Our concern is that so many people rely solely on their home and the equity in it rather than a balanced mix of savings and investments to pay for old age and long-term care. \"We understand that not everyone can afford to put money away in different pots for the longer term, but starting to put money away now on a regular basis could prove to be a real help later in life.\" A spokeswoman for the department of work and pensions said: \"The government is continuing to make real progress in tackling poverty for families with children and pensioners, as well as increasing support for families and adults with or without children through working tax credits and the national minimum wage. \"We know that working age adults are less likely to be in relative low income, and record levels of employment and increased access to work through New Deal show that the best way out of poverty is through work.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
