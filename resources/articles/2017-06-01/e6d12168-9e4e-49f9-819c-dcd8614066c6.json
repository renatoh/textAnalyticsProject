Sitting third in Group D and trailing Serbia and the Republic of Ireland by four points with five matches remaining, Wales have little margin for error on Sunday night in Belgrade, where a defeat would leave their hopes of qualifying for next year\u2019s World Cup finals in Russia hanging by a thread. The task is made considerably harder because Coleman will be without Gareth Bale, his most influential player, through suspension as well as Neil Taylor, who is serving a two-match ban. To compound matters, Hal Robson-Kanu withdrew from the squad on Thursday and added his name to an injury list that includes James Collins, Andy King and Ben Woodburn, leaving Wales looking rather depleted, especially in attack. Although Coleman refuses to be downbeat and remains sanguine about the team\u2019s prospects in Belgrade and beyond, he is prepared for the fact that Serbia will evoke some painful memories. The Wales manager admitted that everything came flooding back when he paid a visit to the country in March. \u201cIt was only a recce but I had butterflies in my stomach: \u2018Here we go, I remember this place,\u2019\u201d Coleman said, recalling the chastening defeat in Novi Sad that led to many Wales supporters calling for his resignation. \u201cI can\u2019t say this is another game in the group because it\u2019s not for more than one reason. And one of the reasons is that [game in 2012]. I suffered there, we suffered there \u2013 and it was my fault. That will never leave me. Nor should it. It will be like that if I went back to Belgrade with my wife for the weekend. \u201cBut I can\u2019t wait for this game. I know it\u2019s going to be tough but I like meeting those challenges. With Balo in the team or not, I can\u2019t guarantee a win. And we\u2019re desperate for a win. But what we must do is perform. We have to stand up to them and not go away with our tails between our legs having missed the game, because that\u2019s unacceptable. I won\u2019t accept that, but I don\u2019t expect it from these players. For some time now they\u2019ve stepped up to the mark.\u201d Although Coleman admitted Wales would miss the experience and knowhow the absent senior players could have provided, he pointed to the presence of Ashley Williams, the captain he described as a \u201cnatural born leader\u201d, to set an example to others that they must \u201cdo anything but turn away from the challenge\u201d. Coleman added: \u201cYou go to these places and it\u2019s almost like there\u2019s a stage in the game where there\u2019s a power play. All of a sudden, from wherever it comes, the crowd start getting really rowdy, the opposition up the tempo for five or 10 minutes and they bombard you. You stand up to it or you duck it. There\u2019s no third option. \u201cThis will come in Belgrade, I know it will before we kick a ball, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll talk about with our players. You need to answer all the questions physically, mentally and tactically. It\u2019s international football, your country against their country. It\u2019s not war but it\u2019s what you stand up for and what they stand up for and bang, it comes together. Something\u2019s got to give and it\u2019s whoever\u2019s capable or not of mentally standing up to it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
