The song is called Harperman and was written by Tony Turner, who worked at Environment Canada and is, in his spare time, \u201ca mainstay on the Ottawa folk music scene\u201d, according to a biography on his website. The song, which is recorded with a backing choir and a double bass, with Turner himself on the guitar, contains lyrics like \u201cno respect for environment / Harperman, it\u2019s time for you to go\u201d, and \u201cno more cons, cons, cons / we want you gone, gone gone\u201d. Turner\u2019s union representatives told the CBC that Turner was being accused of having \u201cviolated the departmental code of values and ethics in that the writing and performing of this song somehow impeded his ability to impartially study migratory birds\u201d. \u201cWe will stand up for its members who face the prospect of being disciplined for exercising their democratic rights as citizens. The supreme court of Canada has confirmed that public service workers, like all Canadian citizens, benefit from freedom of expression,\u201d Debi Daviau, the president of the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada (PIPSC), the union which represents Turner, told the Ottawa Citizen. A Facebook page calling for a nationwide singalong of the song for 17 September was set up after the song was released by a friend of Turner. \u201cCan\u2019t we make jokes or say anything? Are we all muzzled? This is the politics of fear. I am an activist and singer but mostly I am a citizen and I care about democracy and freedom of speech,\u201d Diane McIntyre, who sang a solo in the song, told the Ottawa Citizen. Environment Canada could not be reached by the Guardian for comment. Harper is locked in a re-election campaign. The election is set for 19 October."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
