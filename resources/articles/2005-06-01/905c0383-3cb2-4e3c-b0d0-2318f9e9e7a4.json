However, his assessment of the future is unduly pessimistic. While conceding that the US economy remains buoyant only as a result of China's continued investment in dollar assets, he fails to recognise that massive increases in US defence spending are again only possible due to Chinese purchases of the dollar. That China bankrolls neoconservative policies designed to resist its own rise to hegemony is a great paradox. But the situation cannot last for long. As the US budget deficit continues to rise, China's dollar investments become more risky. At the same time, growing economic strength will make China less reliant on the US. The US will be left with a massive military that it cannot afford. Of course, the US could choose protectionism. But if the US decides not to trade freely with China, why should anyone else do the same? China is already forging strong trade links with Latin America, the Middle East and the Asian subcontinent. This process will continue whether the US likes it or not. Simon Natas London We have been told for many years that China will become the next economic superpower. So you would think that universities would have responded. Yet Ucas lists only four UK universities offering Chinese as a single subject this year. In contrast, 40 universities are are offering French as a single subject. Peter Riding Saffron Walden, Essex"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
