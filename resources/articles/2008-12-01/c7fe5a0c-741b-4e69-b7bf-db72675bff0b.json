It was an encounter dominated by kicking, much of it poor, but Cardiff will not care one jot about that. This was a tremendous away victory in France that gives the Blues one foot in the quarter-finals. And as so often with away wins in this competition it was based entirely on defence \u2013 and a try gifted by the opposition. From the first scrappy minute to the last, Biarritz simply never looked like breaching the thin blue line of the visitors. In such a battling team performance it is sometimes difficult to single out individuals but Tom Shanklin's crunching tackle on prop Mosese Moala in the final seconds summed up his team's commitment, while Ben Blair showed skill and guts on what was a tough day for full-backs. Indeed so strong was Cardiff's defence that though Biarritz had the wind at their backs in the second half they failed to register a single point after the interval. It is still early in the competition and ugly wins such as this can give a team real confidence. As for Biarritz they are effectively out of this year's competition and have now lost their past six games. They worked hard and showed a team spirit lacking in recent months, while Imanol Harinordoquy was outstanding before going off injured, but their lack of confidence and self-belief was evident. All the game's points came in the first half, when despite playing into the wind Biarritz had the better of the opening 10 minutes, as Cardiff struggled to get out of their own half. The visitors took the lead slightly against the run of play, courtesy of a long-range penalty from Blair after the home side went off their feet at a ruck just inside their half. Then after 11 minutes Biarritz hit the self-destruct button. Full-back Benjamin Thiery loitered for far too long faced with a speculative kick ahead and was easily charged down by wing Gareth Jenkins. The ball bounced kindly and centre Jamie Robinson scored the easiest of tries. Blair's conversion made it 10-0, and a dream start for a Cardiff side who had done little to merit the lead. By now Blair and Nicky Robinson had begun to find their kicking range but Biarritz were dominating possession, with Jer\u00f4me Thion and Trevor Hall outstanding in the second row, and clawed themselves to within five meters of the try line only for prop Moala to be penalised for going off his feet. Thiery then made partial amends for his blunder by catching his own up and under just inside the Cardiff half, forcing the Blues to concede a penalty. Cue a typical long-range effort from Damien Traille and the French team were finally on the scoreboard. Five minutes before half-time an awful kick from Nicky Robinson ended up going backwards and once again his side were forced to concede a penalty, this time on the 22-metre line. The excellent Julian Peyrelongue made no mistake and suddenly the French side, who had visibly grown in confidence after their appalling start, were right back in the game. The Blues were then fortunate two minutes later when the Biarritz fly-half hit a post from another penalty attempt 30 metres out. Immediately after the break the Blues again rode their luck when, in a mirror image of the first-half Thiery incident, Blair was charged down in his own 22 \u2013 though this time there was no attacker on hand to touch down. Traille and scrum-half Fabien Cibray were now keeping the Blues pegged in their own half and two outstanding runs from Harinordoquy took the French side close to the try line. After a two-minute arm wrestle between the two packs prop Eduard Coetzee was driven over the line but was held up. Then Biarritz attacked through the backs but a wonderful tackle from Paul Tito stopped a clean break from Philippe Bidab\u00e9 and the visitors clung on. The home side were getting frustrated as for all their dominance they could not crack the Blues' defence. He was immediately substituted and Peyrelongue switched to scrum-half. But the home side, who had passed the ball well in the first half, were guilty of kicking too much, and badly, and lost their rhythm. Meanwhile Dai Young's team were growing in confidence and their defence was unyielding. A powerful run from Andy Powell and a scything run by replacement Tom James were rare reminders of Cardiff's attacking ability. But this was a day for resolute defence, and on this display the Blues have shown that it will take a good side to beat them in this competition."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
