First performed in 1985, Prometeo is the masterpiece of Nono's last decade, the intensely introspective axis around which all his other later works revolve, and for which their etiolated sound world was first imagined. With its array of ensembles, choirs and soloists dispersed around the performing space, and transformed by real-time electronics, any performance is a massive undertaking. This one, conducted by Diego Masson and Patrick Bailey, with the London Sinfonietta, the Royal Academy of Music's Manson Ensemble, Synergy Vocals and an impressive roster of solo instrumentalists was an immense achievement, and unlikely to repeated here for many years. Yet repeated encounters, if only on disc, are really the way to get to grips with Nono's elusive, allusive work, which not only operates on the limit of instrumental audibility, but regularly atomises its patchwork text. There is no narrative thread through the nine movements, just a slow unvaried unfolding, with the haunting vocal lines usually underpinned by just a few instruments. Yet there was a formal clarity about this performance I don't remember from my previous live encounter with Prometeo, a better sense of where Nono's music fits into the late 20th century. Just occasionally, the teetering, trembling sounds break out into massive climaxes, a reminder that Nono, for all his uncompromising modernism, was a Venetian, an heir to the spatial experiments of Monteverdi and the Gabrielis."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
