The process can be long (you don't always get the right person the first time), complicated (there are a plethora of rules and regulations to follow), and frustrating (promising candidates have the habit of being snapped up quickly by other schools). This month the National College for School Leadership has produced a guide to help governors pick the right person. Publication, after more than two years of interviewing heads, governors, local authorities and other stakeholders, comes at a time when education is suffering a shortage of experienced candidates for headship. The guide says that only 43% of deputy heads are interested in progressing to headship, while only 28% of teachers aspire to the top job. However, it claims that, once they have got there, nine out of 10 heads consider their job rewarding. The guide breaks down the appointment process into seven key stages: preparation, definition of need, attraction, selection, appointment, induction and evaluation. It goes through the stages thoroughly with extra pointers on best practice and pitfalls. However, what this guide lacks is more practical information, with some hypothetical scenarios. There are very few suggestions on how to measure a head's ability to communicate with pupils. Should every candidate take a short assembly? Should you observe teaching (crucial in a small primary)? How would this affect the chances of internal candidates? There is no section on how to stand up to an over-bearing LEA adviser who pushes for his candidate against the views of the selection panel - in fact there is nothing about handling \"the local grapevine\" and LEA politics. There is no guidance on what to do if a popular deputy doesn't make the grade and the staff won't work with the new head. These are the type of issues that worry governors and such a detailed analysis of headteacher selection cannot afford to ignore them.
