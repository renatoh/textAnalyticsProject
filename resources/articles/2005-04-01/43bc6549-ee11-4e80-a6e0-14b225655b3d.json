The taste of a relegation battle never leaves you. I have forgotten all about cup finals and international games but I will always remember the stress of trying to stop my team from going down. It means sleepless nights, literally; if you get a couple of hours' rest you are doing well. You go to bed thinking about who you should pick, what you should do, how you are going to go about things in the morning. Then, if you doze off, you wake up thinking about it again. You can't get away from it. You will be sitting at dinner and not hearing anything anyone's saying because your thoughts are turning over. There is no way of relaxing and nor is there anyone you can turn to because nobody else understands. I haven't been involved in as many struggles as people think but the two I had at Coventry mean I understand what it's like. In my first season we survived on the last day and four years later we went down. I took over at Southampton when they were bottom but by the end of that season we weren't involved. Managers get really tense in a relegation battle but you have to look relaxed and confident for the sake of the players, which isn't easy. You try to keep everyone calm and confident but underneath you're like a swan with your legs going. It's so important how a manager comes across. When he walks in after a defeat the players look to see whether he still believes. If he doesn't they can think: \"We're knackered now.\" When I first took over at Coventry there were times when I thought: \"Where do we go from here?\" But then you have a day off and realise you can go again. You have to show that you believe and know exactly what you're doing. You don't want to be chopping and changing things in training. It's no good having a practice match and using six different teams because the players will think: \"He's not really sure what he's up to.\" If the players doubt you or themselves you've got problems. You need everyone to believe and pull together. The group that sticks together best will probably stay up, even though they might not be the best football team. In my first season as Coventry manager everyone believed and was together, but four years later there were a few non-believers. You might be able to take them out of the team but you can't take them out of the club and that can be a killer. Their body language or what they say to other players can make all the difference. A couple of players might say negative things or not be bothered if the team gets relegated because they've got a club coming in for them anyway. I always tried to get a sense from the senior professionals of the mood in the squad and who the believers and non-believers were. They might say things you don't want to hear but you need to know. At Coventry, when we went down, we didn't have belief all through the season for one reason or another. There's loads of reasons, but we sold Robbie Keane and Gary McAllister in July, had no time to replace them and lost our two leading scorers. Four years earlier we had strikers in Dion Dublin and Darren Huckerby who saved the day; scoring goals is key when you're down at the bottom. It's one reason why I think Southampton might stay up. With Peter Crouch, Kevin Phillips and Henri Camara they have more weapons in that department than Norwich, Crystal Palace or West Bromwich Albion. I worked out after 13 games that Palace would survive if Andy Johnson got 25 goals for them and he's got 20 now. Another five and I'm sure they'll do it. But I fancy Southampton will escape if they win at home to Norwich tomorrow. They went so low at Portsmouth on Sunday and usually you come back from that with a top performance because you've been stung so hard. There's a different pressure on Southampton because the other three probably expected to be in this position and were written off at various times. Harry Redknapp is at a club with a history of staying up and it was the same for me at Coventry. The last week of my first season there was so draining I didn't have the energy to play in the final game at Tottenham. I had played the previous five, which had relaxed me and the team, but I was whacked. The last 15 minutes at Spurs, knowing we would stay up if we didn't concede, were the longest I've had. Players get relegated but are never known as players who went down. It's the manager everybody remembers. He gets the stigma of relegation and the players basically get off scot-free. But you know that when you go into the job."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
