The record states that Manchester United beat Benfica 4-1 in the 1968 European Cup final. What is not on record is that Eus\u00e9bio was through on goal towards the end of 90 minutes with the score at 1-1. Only a save by Alex Stepney denied him. Eus\u00e9bio applauded the keeper. Sportsmanship like that in the next few weeks in South Africa would indeed qualify the relevant player or players for the label of greatness that Eus\u00e9bio enjoys in my mind's eye.
