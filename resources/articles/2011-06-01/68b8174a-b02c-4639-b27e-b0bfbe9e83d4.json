Cole was a sprightly pianist who, at this point, had not sung professionally, but legend has it that a big-spending client drunkenly badgered him to sing. Cole reluctantly acquiesced with a version of Sweet Lorraine, showcasing a honey-smooth baritone that would overshadow his pianistic skills. Since then plenty of talented instrumentalists \u2013 from Sarah Vaughan to Diana Krall, from Chet Baker to Jamie Cullum \u2013 have become better known as reluctant vocalists."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
