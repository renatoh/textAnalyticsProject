Wolves, denied their first away win of the season by the Manchester City winger's excellent low strike, were justifiably heartened by their performance and refuse to accept that they are destined for the First Division. Meanwhile, City's third successive draw did nothing to ease the discomfort of their manager, Kevin Keegan, who kept in touch by TV and radio while housebound because of a back injury. Arthur Cox is in temporary charge of City and his observations will not inspire confidence among their fans that this is a squad equipped to handle the traumatic and tense games ahead. Cox accepted that Wolves looked hungrier for victory and said: 'We have a lot of players who are used to winning. They have to get used to the nasty side of football and defend a little bit.' Can City get out of trouble? 'I believe they have the ability to do it,' said Cox. Whether they have the appetite will be seen in the next few weeks. He should be encouraged by the way City reacted after Wolves defied their reputation as soft touches away from home by scoring twice in the first 23 minutes through Mark Kennedy's superb 20-yard strike and Carl Cort's close-range goal, both accepted after feeble clearances by Michael Tarnat. The City defender made amends by providing the crosses for headed replies by Nicolas Anelka and Antoine Sibierski before the interval. A save from Colin Cameron's penalty featured among several fine interventions by the City goalkeeper David James before Henri Camara restored Wolves' lead in the 78th minute. They appeared capable of holding out for an elusive away win until Wright-Phillips seized on a headed clearance by Kennedy and had the final word. David Jones, the Wolves manager, said: 'Football is cruel sometimes. The game was already won and I just wish some of my players had hoofed it clear in the last few minutes. It is ugly, but all the top teams do it because nobody can score from 70 yards away. 'If you score three goals away from home, you should go on to win the game, but at least the result keeps it open at the bottom. We are relying on other results going our way, but we will keep fighting.'
