Groundsmen are working around the clock to improve the playing surface before tomorrow's kick-off but the English head groundsman, Matthew Frost, said: \"It is not like one of the better Premier League pitches, far from it. Unfortunately, things didn't work out. The ball may not travel perfectly like it would on a pitch that has been in situ for some time. There might be a bit of a bobble.\" Blocks of frozen grass shipped in from Slovakia have not bedded down as hoped. The former Liverpool midfielder Steve McMahon said: \"It is awful and embarrassing. To be frank, it is very dangerous for the players if it stays the way it is.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
