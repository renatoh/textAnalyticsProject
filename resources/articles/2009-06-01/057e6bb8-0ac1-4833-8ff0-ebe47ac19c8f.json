Usmanov, who owns 25% of Arsenal, has written to the board proposing the capital-raising exercise as a means of reducing the club's \u00a3400m debts and providing the manager, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, with significant funds for this summer's transfer market. But there are fears within the Emirates hierarchy that the scheme may prove a means by which Usmanov gains greater control in the boardroom. Should the rights issue not be fully subscribed, any dilution of the equity holdings of existing investors would permit him to grow his share."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
