The figures showed 51% of parents in households with incomes below \u00a330,000 said they could not afford everything their child needed for the start of the new school year. The findings, from a YouGov survey of 1,063 parents commissioned by the children's charities Save the Children and Family Action, suggest that schools are failing to act on government warnings to reduce the costs facing parents. Of the families struggling, 43% said they were likely to have problems buying school uniforms, 26% said they would not be able to buy their children the full PE kit, and 19% said they struggled to pay for the books and equipment. Colette Marshall, director of Save the Children UK, said: \"Families living in poverty often have just \u00a320 to spend on food each week, so to find the money to cover all the back to school costs is impossible.\" Government research has suggested parents spend around \u00a3600 to get a child through primary school each year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
