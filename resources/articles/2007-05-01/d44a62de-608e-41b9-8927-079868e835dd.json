Price wants to banish the customer perception that the retailer charges up to 5p more than rivals, such as Asda and Sainsbury's, on branded products. 'We are aware that people doing their weekly shop have to stick to a budget and we want to make sure we don't disappoint.' Waitrose, which is part of the John Lewis Partnership, has laid down an aggressive expansion plan and wants to double sales to \u00a38bn by 2016. Until now, it has only compared 1,500 items with rivals but it will now check all 23,000 lines and reduce prices if it finds a gap. However, Price says when it comes to Waitrose's own brand the price reflects that customers are getting something extra for their money. 'If a product is fresher or more ethically sourced, we are justified in charging a premium.' Waitrose prides itself on the relationships it has forged with suppliers and has established the Waitrose Foundation, which channels a percentage of profits back to South African farmers. The funds are used to finance projects designed to improve the living standards of black farm workers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
