This convincing victory gave Unai Emery\u2019s side top spot in the embryonic Ligue 1 table, although they had trailed at Parc des Princes to Max Gradel\u2019s 18th-minute opener. Neymar pulled PSG level before Adrien Rabiot doubled their lead to ensure they led at half-time. Edinson Cavani then added a third before Thiago Silva\u2019s own-goal gave the visitors hope. But Javier Pastore, Layvin Kurzawa and then Neymar, the world\u2019s most expensive player, found the net to finish the rout. After scoring on his debut at Guingamp, the Brazil international has now scored three goals in two matches for PSG since arriving from Barcelona."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
