Giles conceded, as he looked forward to Friday's first match of the one-day series against India from the basement of the heavily-guarded hotel in central Rajkot that is being shared by both teams, that Fletcher had played a key role in steering him into the position to fill in for the England team director, Andy Flower, in one-day and Twenty20 cricket, and therefore into the pole position to succeed him ultimately in all forms of the game. The pair even shared a breakfast table in Delhi earlier this week and chatted amicably through a range of non-cricketing matters. But when it comes to Fletcher's growing unpopularity in India after his team's recent home defeats by England in Test cricket and against Pakistan in the ODI series over the past fortnight, Giles's aim is to put the boot in. \"Duncan was influential in my career and one of the reasons I probably went into coaching,\" said the 39-year-old from Surrey, who played the majority of his 54 Tests under Fletcher between 1998 and 2006. Fletcher regularly courted unpopularity by selecting Giles ahead of Monty Panesar, notably at the start of the disastrous 2006-07 Ashes tour that would mark the end of the road with England for both men \u2013 at least until now; and the pair combined with Nasser Hussain to infuriate India on the 2001 Test tour, when Giles cynically stifled Sachin Tendulkar by bowling over the wicket down the legside in Bangalore. \"Yes, he was,\" Giles agreed when it was suggested that Fletcher had been a loyal advocate. \"He talked about consistency a lot, and I hope that is one of my strengths as well. But that doesn't mean I'm going to give him the series.\" He also stopped short of describing Fletcher as the best coach he had played under. \"I wouldn't say that \u2013 but I wouldn't say he wasn't either,\" Giles responded, the man once dubbed the wheelie bin sitting with impressive balance on the backyard fence. \"I was lucky to play under Bob Woolmer, he was a great coach. Phil Neale I learned a lot from, a great organiser; John Inverarity as well. I was lucky and you pick bits from all of them. Fletch through the England years was certainly influential. \"Duncan's technical nous is fantastic, as Bob's was. As well as good stuff you learn bad stuff as well so you take the bits you like. I am sure people will say the same about me, they will not like the way I operate all the time.\" Giles confirmed that he will be in regular contact with Flower throughout this five-match series and then when the team move on for another three one-day internationals in New Zealand next month, as the pair plot the best use of England's resources in a hectic year which includes the chance to win the last ICC Champions Trophy on home soil before consecutive Ashes series. That is why Giles has started his work with such a callow group of bowlers. Leaving Graeme Swann, Stuart Broad and James Anderson at home has left Steve Finn and Tim Bresnan to lead the attack, despite the doubts over their fitness and form respectively. That is one reason why Giles seemed anxious to play down expectations at his first press conference as England's one-day coach. \"We're here to develop and find out more about these guys and if at the end of it we lose the series and each player has moved on 5% through the experience then we're doing our jobs,\" he added. \"Let's not beat around the bush, it is a challenge but one the guys should be looking forward to.\" There is already a real sense of occasion in this Gujarat town well off the tourist, or even the international cricket, track. India have played a single ODI in Rajkot, against Sri Lanka, since England were thrashed by 158 runs in November 2008, when Yuvraj Singh plundered 138 from 78 balls, with Samit Patel marginally the most expensive of England's bowlers. Patel, who is sweating on selection in Giles's first team, might therefore be relieved that the Saurashtra cricket authorities have since constructed a new stadium around 10 miles out of town, which will be staging its first ODI. But for most of Wednesday, large crowds gathered around the Imperial Palace hotel, watched by more than 100 police officers. Earlier Yuvraj had joined Virat Kohli, their captain MS Dhoni and several lower-profile members of the squad in generating awe on a Mumbai airport courtesy bus and then on the short flight to Rajkot. This India team may be under pressure, but even without Tendulkar they retain ample star quality. Giles could certainly have asked for an easier start."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
