It's purely a matter of personal preference, but for my money the Black Mountains win on account of their fabulous, quiet, verdant valleys like the Olchon and the Vale of Ewyas. It is the northernmost tops, like Tumpa and Pen-y-Beacon, that command the finest vistas, out across the complex hills and dales that constitute the Wye Valley, and far away to the hills of Radnor Forest and beyond. The other afternoon we stood upon the prow of Pen-y-Beacon (676m, 2,219ft) in a stiff north-west wind and later turned to the south to stride the path to the 703m (2,306ft) summit of Black Mountain itself. This peaty crest used to offer a pretty awful traverse in wet conditions, but now large stone slabs allow you to reach the top dryshod; slabs brought, like those in the Peak District heights, from west Yorkshire textile mills. Of all attractive corners of these hills, though, my favourite is the crest away to the east and entirely in England. It is Black Hill and from its 641m (2,102ft) top a sharp ar\u00eate thrusts to the south east. To go down it on an afternoon such as ours is pure delight. The slabby rock tors that punctuate its narrow cock's comb make super foregrounds for photographs of deepest, quietest Herefordshire; out across shallow dales containing a thousand patchwork fields where dappled sunlight caught the last cornfields and the first ploughlands of autumn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
