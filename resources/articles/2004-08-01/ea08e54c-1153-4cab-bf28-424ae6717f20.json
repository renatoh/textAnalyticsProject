Although the Mary Rose was engaged in a battle with the French in 1545, it was weather and its construction which sank it so quickly, within sight of the shore, that only a handful of the crew survived. One explanation is that the ship, refitted to take new heavier guns, was so top heavy that even moderate wind and waves made it capsize. The swivel gun found on Tuesday, a virtually unrecognisable lump of corroded iron and concretions, is of particular interest because it may have been one of the new guns mounted on the top rail in the front section of the ship that was missing when most of the wreck was raised 20 years ago. The find will be announced today in Portsmouth, along with that of 40 huge curved timbers giving evidence for the lost front section: the familiar reconstruction drawings, showing the ship with a jaunty miniature castle, are guesswork. More objects are being recovered every day by the team of underwater archaeologists, who have completed more than 230 hours of diving: a rare find of a gunner's tool; a copper alloy priming wire; pulley blocks; quantities of lead and iron shot; and stone cannon balls - as well as dozens of later objects, including a Georgian ceramic bottle inscribed Lidbetters, St Mary's Street, Portsmouth, and a trowel dropped by an archaeologist 20 years ago. While Britain has sweltered, the archaeologists have been groping in clouds of silt swept by tides that the chief archaeologist, Alex Hildred, said felt like working in a gale-force wind. The wreck was initially excavated by divers who included Prince Charles, and raised in a dramatic operation watched by television viewers around the world. But a large part of the ship, about a fifth, had broken away centuries ago and remained buried on the seabed when the rest was raised. The Mary Rose Trust has spent the past 20 years, and millions of pounds, on conservation work on the huge timbers it already has, and which it hopes to house with thousands of items recovered from the ship in a new purpose-built museum in Portsmouth. In the next 10 days, as this diving season ends, the newly discovered timbers will have to be reburied to preserve them. The decision has still to be taken on whether to attempt the difficult and expensive task of raising them. \u00b7 More at www.maryrose.org"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
