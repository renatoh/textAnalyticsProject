That was not just because her decision to play in spectacles has contributed to a change of appearance from that of a discus thrower to something nearer to a philosophy student, but because of her inability to win the big points during a 6-1, 6-3 defeat to Magui Serna, who is ranked outside the top 40. Had Baltacha played with more conviction after being required to serve at 30-40 following a two-hour rain break she might have held on to an early break of serve in the second set. It might also have enabled her to snatch one of the two break-points she had in the following game, or one of the four game points she had in the game after that. \"She just had so many chances,\" said her coach Alan Jones sadly, though he did not look entirely surprised. Serna, who has reached the quarter-finals of Wimbledon and the final at Eastbourne, is that rare thing, a Spaniard who is better on grass than anything else, while Baltacha is still trying to recover momentum after losing four months to chicken pox, tonsillitis and food poisoning. Another home player given a Wimbledon wild card, Julie Pullin, fended off potential criticism about unearned pickings at SW19 with a good result. Although the British No1 has yet to win a match at Wimbledon in seven attempts, she has been in the best form of her career recently and overcame Angelique Widjaja, the world No92 from Indonesia, who is ranked more than 50 places higher, by 6-3, 6-2."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
