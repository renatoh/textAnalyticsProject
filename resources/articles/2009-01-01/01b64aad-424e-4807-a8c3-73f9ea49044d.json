Goodness, though, it was a scrap, with Fulham securing their place in this evening's fifth-round draw with goals from Andy Johnson and Bobby Zamora in the last three minutes. Afterwards, Imraan Ladak, the Kettering chairman, described as incredible Mike Riley's decision not to send off the Fulham defender Brede Hangeland for the foul on Craig Westcarr in the 81st minute for which he awarded Kettering a penalty. That brought the score to 2-2 and Ladak was furious that the visitors did not have to play the final minutes with only 10 men. On a bright, chilly afternoon, with Rockingham Road resplendent in all the dowdiness bestowed on it by years of making do with minimal housekeeping, the match quickly settled into a predictable formula: Fulham monopolising the classy stuff, Kettering coming out on top for unbridled endeavour. The home team's hustling came desperately close to producing a goal after only four minutes when Andr\u00e9 Boucaud played the ball in, Hangeland failed to deal with it and Westcarr stepped in quickly but hooked his shot wide. Fulham, though, had been dominating the early minutes and their pressure yielded a sublime goal in the 12th minute. Clint Dempsey found space on the right to deliver a cross from which Simon Davies rocketed a volley past Lee Harper. To Kettering's immense credit they came back from this set-back and a period of Fulham pressure to eke out an equaliser after 36 minutes. Fredrik Stoor upended the lively Westcarr on the edge of the penalty area and the Kettering striker picked himself up to angle his free-kick, with the help of a deflection, into Mark Schwarzer's net. The goal transformed Kettering's effort. For the remainder of the first half and for most of the second they were certainly the more dangerous side in terms of chances created \u2013 and arguably the better side, despite the 93 places separating the two teams. A lucky goal by Danny Murphy, brought on as a substitute midway through the second half, put Fulham back in front, his speculative shot in the 77th minute going in off Exodus Geohaghon, but Kettering showed great resolve to draw level. Westcarr was once more in the thick of it, converting a penalty after he had been pulled down by Hangeland, who received a yellow card for his clumsiness \u2013 but not a red. Nine minutes left and Kettering looked to have the replay they so desperately wanted \u2013 and warranted \u2013 in their grasp. It was not to be, though. In the 88th minute Zamora, who had come on as a substitute with Murphy, headed the ball on for Johnson to nod in from close range and a minute later Zamora himself claimed Fulham's fourth with a shot on the turn from the edge of the area. Defeat ended a three-month Cup adventure for Kettering \u2013 and also Ladak's hopes that the competition would deliver a windfall to help underwrite his ambitious plans. Ladak stayed with Kettering after his grand entrance in 2005 went badly wrong with Paul Gascoigne as manager. Now, thanks to Ladak, the club are in a place of relative security and might have been even more so with a different outcome yesterday. To make big money, though, Kettering needed to be drawn away yesterday to a big club or to be shown live on television, neither of which materialised. The draw failed to supply a trip to Old Trafford or Stamford Bridge but it did pair Kettering with top-flight opponents \u2013 and a non-League club against a Premier League side normally guarantees a fat fee for being screened live. To Ladak's mortification this never happened, with ITV and Setanta deciding that five other ties were capable of doing more for their ratings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
