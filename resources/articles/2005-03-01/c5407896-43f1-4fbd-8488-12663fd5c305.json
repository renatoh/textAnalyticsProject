He observes: \"In spite of its potency, ayahuasca has had relatively little literary treatment.\" Shukman might enjoy reading the work of another English writer who preceded him. Martin Goodman, Whitbread shortlisted, lived in Santa Fe for years, took ayahuasca there and in Peru, and wrote about it in I Was Carlos Castaneda: The Afterlife Dialogues , (Random House 2001). To my taste, Goodman's account of being on ayahuasca is more masterful that that of Peter Matthiessen which Shukman lauds. Goodman's account is more credible too, and displays a deeper understanding of the shamanic world that uses ayahuasca as its communion. James K Thornton Santa Fe, New Mexico Run out of steam Ian Jack's excellent piece for Clyde steamer buffs (\"Lay of the last duchess\", March 12) was illustrated by a view of the Motor Vessel Lochfyne, the first diesel-electric ship built (in 1931) for service in Britain. As a MacBrayne ship she did not fall into any of the naming categories listed by Jack either, but rumbled her noisy way almost alone among his smooth, silent steamers for 30-odd years. Hopes that the sister ship of the new Bute, due to be ordered soon, might be named Duchess of Rothesay are probably vain! Walter McCormick Basingstoke Rothesay's romantic nicknames - Madeira of the North and Madeira of Scotland - sound too snobby. The old Red Guide had the right idea - Rothesay: the Margate of Glasgow. Diana would have enjoyed the joke, and so, I think, will Camilla. Mike Whitley Whitstable, Kent Stacks of memory I disagree with Brian Jenner (Letters, March 12) about the problem of book storage. Like him I have recently moved and find wobbly pillars of books demarcating walkways and elephantine laundry bags of the same blocking the cupboard under the stairs. The unsortedness creates some wild juxtapositions: the two-volume Shorter Oxford Dictionary pinning down Mark Z Danielewski's House of Leaves, Philip Kerr's A Philosophical Investigation next to The History of Harlow , Lawrence Weschler's Mr Wilson's Cabinet of Wonder rubbing spines with Daniel Goldhagen's Hitler's Willing Executioners . This is as far from Dewey decimal classification as it's possible to get, each and every volume indexing and memorialising the occasion of its purchase - a collected life in other words. Michael Hampton London After reading Brian Jenner, I would suggest that two bibles is one too many. I recently came across www.bookcrossing.com, the website to which any excess books can find their way to far-off lands. The delight comes in seeing your left parcels being picked up and finding new homes, and messages in your inbox from strangers who have heeded the call. What's more, it's free. Mel Meleeshka Glastonbury Sanskrit studies Sanskrit did not ossify (\"Speaking of tongues\", March 12) but mutated to several secondary and tertiary derivatives, namely, Pali, Prakrit, Hindusthani and Bengali. It was brought to northern India around the Indus valley by the Aryan settlers from central Asia and then spread to the rest of the subcontinent, except South India where it could not wholly replace the Dravidian languages. Even now it is possible to study for a degree course in Sanskrit in a few Indian univer sities, although as a dialect it is virtually extinct. Sam Banik London Low spirits Christopher Hitchens exhibits all his usual prejudices in his introduction to Isabel Allende's The House of the Spirits (\"A house divided\", March 5). Pablo Neruda and Victor Jara are \"dull and sinister communists\" - Jara was a hero as were many other communists and leftists. Then there's the incredible tenuity of roping in the Spanish Civil War, the Russian Revolution, and a cheap sneer at Cuba. The many Chilean refugees I know in Britain have never subscribed to Hitchens's ultra-left pronouncements on Chile, Allende's government and the coup. He should take in the wonderful documentary Allende and get some real insights into the complexity of the situation. John Kay Glasgow Early warning In Simon Callow's otherwise excellent review of Lost Edens: Adventures in a Victorian Utopia (\"Spirit levels\", March 12), he states \"near Aldeburgh, in 1827, a mere five years before the beginning of Queen Victoria's reign\". I am sure Mr Callow meant 10 years before, as Queen Victoria began her reign in 1837. Brian Leedham Surrey Batsqueaks of desire Regarding James Fenton's incomprehension of the DH Lawrence poem \"Man and Bat\" (March 12): the poem is weird, yes, without sense, no. As any lover will tell you, there is nothing he or she will not do for a sick partner, even to finding ostrich feathers and nourishing bread in Eastwood. Absurd possibly, but touching also, and communicating love - the real point.
