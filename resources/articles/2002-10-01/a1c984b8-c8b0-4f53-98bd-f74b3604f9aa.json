He opened up a 4-0 lead thanks to breaks of 81, 44, 71 and 137 and his break of 78 in the sixth frame completed an astonishing afternoon. \"I had to produce that kind of performance to stand any chance because Ronnie's the kind of player who can blow you away,\" said the world No29 from Leith. Although O'Sullivan bungled one clear-cut chance early in the third frame, his post-match self-criticism was excessive: \"The way I played was unacceptable. It makes me wonder why I bother.\" O'Sullivan's exit means that no top-eight player will feature in the semi-finals in which Small will play the Yorkshireman Jimmy Michie, who had to win the last four frames to shade Gerard Greene 5-4. Breaks of 66 and 77 put Greene into a 2-0 lead and, after Michie had pulled one back, he won back-to-back frames again to increase his advantage to what appeared a match-winning 4-1. But then Michie responded, winning the next three, including breaks of 66 and 98 and clinching the decider in style when potting the winning pink from distance. \"I thought I was dead and buried at 4-1 down. I had to knuckle in there, slow my game down and concentrate on every shot,\" said Michie."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
