Andrew Goodacre, the chief executive of Bira, a trade association representing 3,000 independent retailers, said his members were furious that large homewares and other non-food businesses were continuing to trade while small businesses were sticking to the rules. \u201cThey are using words like injustice, unfair and un-level playing field,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government need to make it very clear to these large companies that they cannot open or can only sell what they deem essential, not a whole range of Christmas trees and lights.\u201d Retailers selling furnishings, homewares, clothing and electronic goods and other \u201cnon-essential\u201d goods, such as toys and stationery, were all told to close their doors for a month on Thursday under new regulations designed to control the spread of coronavirus. Supermarkets, garden centres, bike shops, newsagents and those selling food, pet supplies and hardware, such as DIY shops, are all classed as essential and allowed to continue to trade. Detailed guidelines published on Friday confirmed that supermarkets or other \u201cmixed\u201d retailers would not have to rope-off individual aisles where they were selling a small amount of homewares, clothing or other goods deemed non-essential. However, those selling non-essential goods via concessions or separate areas or floors of their stores were told to close those sections down. \u201cIndependent non-essential retailers have accepted the [lockdown] ruling but what they can\u2019t accept is that it doesn\u2019t apply to competitors like homeware stores that might sell a bit of hardware and food. It seems completely unfair that those retailers can bend the rules at this important trading time,\u201d Goodacre said. Bira\u2019s comments came as Mike Ashley\u2019s Frasers Group said that the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis was \u201ccausing devastation\u201d in the retail sector. Frasers said it would not be opening any of its chains, including Sports Direct, upmarket fashion store Flannels and Evans, the latter of which is allowed to trade because bike shops are classed as an essential retailer. In a statement released to the stock market on Friday, the group singled out Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove who criticised Ashley\u2019s attempts to classify Sport Direct during the spring lockdown as an \u201cessential retailer\u201d. Frasers said the government was \u201cfailing to provide the leadership and guidance that businesses require\u201d with \u201crisible mismanagement\u201d of the pandemic. A source at one major retailer which competes with The Range said: \u201cIt\u2019s the wild west out there. The legislation was rushed and now government has lost control, with some retailers taking liberties in a very unfair playing field.\u201d Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses added: \u201cPolicymakers shouldn\u2019t be working on the assumption that bigger retail settings are automatically safer \u2013 decisions should be purely intelligence led.\u201d In light of the guidance published on Friday, Marks &amp; Spencer, which had already closed stores selling only clothing and homewares and some upper floors of shops selling food on the ground floor, said it would now only be opening clothing departments operating directly alongside food areas. Stores which had kept first floors filled with clothing open on Thursday subsequently closed them on Friday. In contrast, The Range continued to trade from upper floors filled with Christmas decorations or other non-essential items. The Range said it remained open because it stocked \u201cthousands of essential everyday products\u201d at its 184 stores. \u201cAs a value retailer, we understand that a lot of our customers rely on us to provide essential items like groceries, pet care products, non-prescription medicines, toiletries and cleaning items, at the low prices that they need right now,\u201d the retailer said on its website. Theo Paphitis, the owner of Ryman, said the stationery and office-kit store was continuing to trade \u201cby virtue of its significant and increasing turnover in the financial sector through Western Union, its Post Offices and DHL parcels business\u201d. A statement on Carpetright\u2019s website said its stores remained open after it had \u201creviewed the regulations\u201d and it was \u201cexperiencing a high volume of inquiries from customers, trade partners and companies as to whether they will be able to complete their essential projects for their home or business\u201d. In the outer east London town of Romford on Friday there was evidence at a Range branch of non-essential goods selling well. A steady stream of shoppers were visiting the outlet on Friday lunchtime, browsing the aisles of bedding, furniture and Christmas decorations. The Romford branch hosts a small branch of food retailer Iceland within the store. However, when the Guardian visited, the number of customers selecting baubles, tinsel and festive jumpers on display in the Christmas shop on the first floor of the store far outnumbered those who were purchasing groceries. A pair of customers had visited with a handwritten shopping list of items they wanted to buy. The vast majority of products displayed on the first floor of the shop, including furniture, homeware and Christmas trees, would not be classed as essential in the government regulations, although there was a small aisle of bird feed. Customer Maureen Dobson had bought \u201ca few Christmas bits\u201d in the store. She said she had gone to the shop in the hope it wasn\u2019t too busy. She had expected it to be open because it also sells food. Paul Stepton had visited to buy groceries from Iceland, but said he had come away with more shopping than anticipated. \u201cI got food and some paint. I didn\u2019t come for fireworks, but I think it\u2019s the only place that does them. I just got some sparklers,\u201d he said. Across town, most shops on the high street were closed, or only offering click and collect to their customers. In Marks &amp; Spencer, the ground floor selling women\u2019s clothing and housing its food hall remained open, but signs informed customers that they were not allowed to shop on other floors of the shop. Ryman was also open for trade, in a branch which offers DHL parcel services and Western Union money transfer. Meanwhile, the Romford branch of the flooring retailer Carpetright also remained open with a small number of customers browsing inside on Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
