Consider his latest show, Electric Hotel. Audience members sit in a glorified car park in front of a four-storey hotel, where seven dancers in different rooms enact their own sad melodramas. In one box, a couple row and flirt over and over again. In another, a man in his underwear plays air guitar. Up top is a nightclub. Periodically, maids clean up, a dispatch rider brings in a mysterious package \u2013 and a scream jolts staff and guests out of their reveries. This is uneasy eavesdropping \u2013 and for co-director Rosenberg and his crew it is also hard graft. Electric Hotel is that rare bird: a site-specific show that tours (it's been to Norfolk and is now in London before heading to Stockton). It also has that Rosenbergian experimentation with sound \u2013 audience members clamp on headphones that pipe in stray laughter, distorted music and menacing phrases. The son of a physiologist, Rosenberg has collaborated with neuroscientists to explore how audience focus can be manipulated by the use of sound. And as a founding member of the experimental theatre collective Shunt, he has put on pieces influenced by Rear Window and Twin Peaks \u2013 but which also take their cue from Brecht's work in audience alienation. Now 40, he draws a younger crowd that would normally go out dancing, not watch it. Yet his work is stylish and suggestive, creating an atmosphere that stays with audiences \u2013 and troubles them too. One to watch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
