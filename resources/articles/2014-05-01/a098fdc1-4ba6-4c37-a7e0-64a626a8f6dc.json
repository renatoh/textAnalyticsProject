As treasurer Joe Hockey unveiled plans for major cuts to social and health services, his budget also provides up to $89.9m over two years to fund Australia\u2019s contribution to the search. The missing plane is believed to have been lost in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Western Australia. Aerial and underwater searches have been going on for more than two months involving dozens of ships and aircraft. Despite the massive search effort, no traces of the plane have been found, causing the search to move to a new underwater phase. The budget papers say the actual costs of the search \u201cwill depend on a number of factors, including the outcome of procurement processes for specialist services, the length of the search, and the extent of contributions from other countries\u201d. At a press conference in April Tony Abbott said Australia would be requesting contributions from other nations involved in the search, although it is not clear whether the details of these contributions have been finalised."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
