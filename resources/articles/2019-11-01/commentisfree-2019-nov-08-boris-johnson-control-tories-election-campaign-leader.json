But he\u2019s lost control", "bodyText": "The spectacle of Boris Johnson in a suit is increasingly disconcerting. Everything the prime minister says would make much more sense if he was wearing just his pants and a three-day-old dressing gown, and slurring, \u201cI promise you I\u2019ll CHANGE \u2026\u201d at one of the mothers of his children. It goes without saying that he might win a majority. Then again, he might not. It\u2019s certainly been quite a taboo-busting start to the Conservatives\u2019 election campaign, featuring monstrous Grenfell insults, allegations of deliberately collapsed rape trials, and the blithe suggestion that Jeremy Corbyn might literally shoot the rich. I think this is the bit where we\u2019re meant to ask what they call their act, and for Johnson to triumphantly declare: \u201cThe Aristocrats!\u201d Either way, it has felt worth remembering all week that Johnson did actually have a clear majority for something. Namely, his Brexit deal, which was voted in favour of three weeks ago, but which he then went and pulled, on the pretext that the House of Commons asked for more than 15 minutes or so to debate it. Had the PM permitted parliament that non-luxury, he could have passed it into law and gone to the country with it in his back pocket, with Nigel Farage a more neutered force, and a few more weeks\u2019 election planning than those that have yielded the current masterclass. But he knew best. Or did he? This remains to be seen, but if it turns out that Johnson needlessly brought about his own downfall via misplaced pride, it will be awkward to know quite what to say. Other than: don\u2019t suppose you know any Ancient Greek, babe? Because I heard they had a word for this. I\u2019ll lend you a Ladybird book about it while you contemplate a future phoning your speaking agent to scream: \u201cI don\u2019t understand why they\u2019d book Stephen Fry and not me \u2013 I\u2019m a 10th of his price!\u201d On the subject of presumably competitively priced after-dinner speakers, what a week to learn that Theresa May has been signed up to the circuit, believed to have fought off a bid from the speaking clock for her services. May bills herself as a specialist in \u201cinspiring lives\u201d and how to \u201cachieve progress\u201d. Why not just add election-winning and contemporary streetdance? In for a penny; in for an unspecified number of pounds an hour. The news did seem to confirm that irony-manufacture is our sole thriving industry. Indeed, merely hours after both Sajid Javid and John McDonnell promised \u00a322bn and \u00a355bn of investment respectively, it was revealed that Crossrail is currently going to be at least three years late and several billion over budget. The Institute for Fiscal Studies is advising huge caution over both Javid and McDonnell\u2019s promises, but it feels perfectly conceivable to imagine either of these chancellors getting at least one set of public lavatories and a couple of extra tube stops for their promised bazillions, albeit not until the turn of the 2030s. Elsewhere, imbecility remains a key battleground, with debate over which party is fielding the more extravagantly or malevolently stupid candidates. Is it the Tories, whose children and families minister Nadhim Zahawi insisted he wasn\u2019t sure whether Jeremy Corbyn would shoot the rich, adding: \u201dYou\u2019ll have to ask him that question\u201d? Or is it Labour, whose newly selected Pudsey candidate Jane Aitchison provided the BBC\u2019s Emma Barnett with 12.5 seconds of dead air in a discussion in which she apparently excused another candidate saying she\u2019d celebrate the death of Tony Blair. It was one of those clips you listen to going, \u201cDon\u2019t say Hitler. Don\u2019t say Hitler. Don\u2019t say Hitler. Don\u2019t say Hitler.\u201d \u201cFor instance,\u201d reasoned Jane, \u201cthey celebrated the death of Hitler.\u201d Only in a field like this could Boris Johnson retain a reputation as an orator. The best way to get through a Johnson speech is tell yourself he\u2019s going to make 10 jokes he\u2019s done numerous times before, then it won\u2019t be so bad when he only does nine. His three-and-a-half minute campaign launch set in Birmingham saw a return for several \u201cold friends\u201d. Yet again, Johnson produced his line about broadband being \u201cinformative vermicelli\u201d, as though he were Taylor Swift and he had to do Shake it Off because that\u2019s what the crowd had come for. \u201cThis is a prime minister on fire,\u201d judged Gavin Williamson, who seems to be back in the fireplace selling business. The Liberal Democrats remain in the Jo Swinson-selling business, having put her front and centre of their campaign and all over their bus. Swinson sounds deeply over-coached, as you might expect of someone who has been an MP since she was 25. It\u2019s difficult to imagine a career path that could make you less well-adjusted. I can\u2019t help feeling Jo would have been better off as a Hollywood child star, or signing for Manchester City at nine before having both legs broken at 16. Then there was an inevitable second launch for Farage\u2019s Brexit party, in which he doubled down on promises of a \u201ccleaner\u201d Brexit. I suppose there\u2019s a kind of justice to Johnson now being on the wrong end of this rubbish. The bad news is that millions of cubic litres of demons have been released in the past three years; the worse news is that it\u2019s the people who opened the box who are now charged with rounding them up. Thus Brexiteers are now attempting to debunk that which they themselves bunked barely four months ago. \u201cWe cannot simply DEMAND a \u2018GATT Article 24\u2019 agreement with [the EU],\u201d Johnson supporter Steve Baker fumed this week. \u201dThis is not how the process works.\u201d Right. I was trying to remember who had floated the idea that you could dictate to the EU in this way, when the name came to me: it was a guy called Boris Johnson. A real end-to-end service, as has always been the case with Johnson and Brexit since his Brussels correspondent days. He makes you sick so he can sell you the cure, and when the cure makes you even sicker, he\u2019ll flog you the cure for that. I mean, I\u2019ll tolerate this as the business model for Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Goop website, but feel like it\u2019s aiming low for a country. Ditto the truly alarming clip of Johnson lurching and rambling at a Northern Ireland reception on Thursday night, during which he appeared to misunderstand Irish border checks, his own Brexit deal, and when to close his mouth. I know we\u2019ve all had to lower our bars, but I guess I still want the person in control to be able to control himself. The most disturbing element of this performance is that the prime minister will almost certainly not have drunk a drop of alcohol. Just as it did in his nightmarish turn at the police academy a few weeks ago, the task of governing even himself seemed quite beyond him. Frequently accused of sexual incontinence, Johnson now seems to have developed verbal incontinence. And who knows what besides. That\u2019s the thing about unchecked appetites: they end up consuming you. So let\u2019s play out this first week of the election campaign with the prime minister shambling about, like the grotesque illustration to some cautionary nursery rhyme. \u201cBoris was so self-obsessed / It quite devoured all the rest / Nothing but a husk remained / To his ego was he chained. / Here he gurgled on the telly / Droning about vermicelli / There he mumbled customs vows / His own supporters raising brows. / Children out for number one / Start with friends but end with none. / They\u2019re left quite mad and most unhappy / Needing several kinds of nappy.\u201d \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
