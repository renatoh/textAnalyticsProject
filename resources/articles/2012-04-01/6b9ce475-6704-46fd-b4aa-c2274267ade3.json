New buyer inquiries edged up to levels not seen since 2010, with 9% more surveyors reporting increases rather than decreases in demand, according to data published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics). The report also said more new properties came on to the market during March. Simon Rubinsohn, Rics' chief economist, said: \"Demand saw a slight boost in March as many first-time buyers looked to beat the stamp duty holiday deadline. There has been a gentle increase in activity across the market in the early part of the year but it remains to be seen is whether this can continue, given the changes in the budget and ongoing problems affecting the economy. London continues to outperform the rest of the UK in terms of prices but, interestingly, the north-west did see an increase in activity in March.\" Less positive regional variations were also evident, Rics noted, with the north of England, East Anglia and Scotland seeing buyer interest drop. The stamp duty holiday ended last month after being introduced in 2010. It had allowed first-time buyers to save up to \u00a32,500 by exempting them from 1% stamp duty on homes worth between \u00a3125,000 and \u00a3250,000. Ministers said the move had not helped people to get on to the property ladder as hoped. However, despite March's rise in demand, Rics said prices continued to edge downwards across all regions of the country except London, albeit at a slower pace than in recent months, as predictions for prices across the UK remained flat for the second consecutive month. The survey, which polls around 300 surveyors each month, follows data released last week by property analysts Hometrack, which showed house prices rose in March for the first time in 20 months, also partly helped by increased activity ahead of the ending of the first-time-buyer stamp duty holiday. It found that prices rose 0.2% last month, according to a survey of 1,500 surveyors and agents, with London's 0.5% increase leading the way. This was the biggest monthly rise in the capital since April 2010, but elsewhere in the country the picture was mixed, with the midlands, the north and Wales showing declines."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
