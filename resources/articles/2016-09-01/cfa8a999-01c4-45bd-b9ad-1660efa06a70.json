Bale\u2019s double helped Wales to a comfortable 4-0 victory, lifted him above Ivor Allchurch and Trevor Ford into outright second place and, most significantly, within four goals of Rush. He has now scored 20 goals in his last 31 appearances for his country \u2013 only four arrived in the first 31 matches \u2013 and Coleman predicts that Rush\u2019s record will fall by the time Wales finish their campaign at home against the Republic of Ireland in October next year. \u201cHe will break it,\u201d the Wales manager said. \u201cIf you look at his record in the last two years, you would have to say he has every chance of doing it in this campaign. Knowing Bale-o, he won\u2019t even know about that [the record]. He comes along and he just fits in with the furniture and gets on with the job. He may know that he\u2019s four goals away but he won\u2019t think that he\u2019s got to get them in this campaign, he\u2019ll just go and do what he does. But there\u2019s every chance, in my opinion, that he could do that in the next nine games.\u201d Bale also set up Wales\u2019 opening goal for Sam Vokes on an evening when Joe Allen scored his first for his country. It was a wonderful cross from the right that Vokes converted. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a Gareth Bale on the pitch, in a second he can change your life,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cOne pinpoint cross, in an area of the pitch where Moldova had plenty of bodies, a great header and then it\u2019s 1-0.\u201d On the back of Sam Allardyce\u2019s comments about Wayne Rooney and the freedom that the England manager is prepared to give his captain, Coleman was asked whether Bale has a similar licence to roam for Wales. \u201cWe start him in a position and make sure he knows the formation and what the tactical game plan is. \u201cBut I can\u2019t tie down somebody like him,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout the ball he knows where he needs to be and he\u2019s got a job. With the ball, it\u2019s game on, whatever he wants to do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
