There are apparently 638 schools attended by poorer, disadvantaged or unselected students where only around 30% get the five GCSEs at A-C level, including maths and English. With a bit more maths and history, Balls might celebrate the remarkable increase in students passing what was originally a matriculation exam designed for around 10% of the school population, which became from 1952 to 1986 the O-level exams designed for some 20%. Now, hooray, even in so-called failing schools nearly 30% acquire the equivalent at GCSE level, and the non-failing schools do even better. And what a shame he's using it all to hammer schools, teachers and local authorities again, and continue breaking up our state education system via academies and trusts. Will all these new agents running our schools - private companies, charitable foundations, religious and voluntary organisations - really help us get a better-educated population, not to mention a cohesive society. Professor Sally Tomlinson Senior research fellow, Department of Education, Oxford University The government's plan to threaten \"failing schools\" with closure was tried during the 1970s in San Francisco, where it was then called \"reconstitution\". Schools were closed and reopened with new staff, it was known as the \"Clint Eastwood\"-style solution. The result? In many schools the cycle of failure was repeated, students left, it was difficult to recruit teachers and communities were stigmatised as \"failing\". Has New Labour learned nothing from the ill-fated Fresh Start initiative in 1997? In one week three heads resigned, and schools like Fircroft in Newcastle subsequently closed. Many of the 638 schools have been inspected by Ofsted and found to be good or outstanding. Schools in \"challenging circumstances\" with disaffected pupils is an entirely different prospect from the selective grammars, faith and academy schools. Richard Knight Liverpool As governor of an inner-city London school with 50% free school meals, I was proud of the fact that our results improved by around 4% year on year, with 50% achieving five A-C GCSEs in 2007. But a 36-hour whirlwind inspection by three Ofsted inspectors deemed us \"failing\". The result was chaos. The headteacher was sacked and governing body dissolved, with no replacement for a term. We are now told that the third headteacher and fourth head of the interim governing body will work with the council's third education chief to turn the school into an academy this autumn - by handing it over to a venture capitalist with no experience of education. Michael Ball London It is unfortunate that you use the shorthand of \"failing\" schools for those that achieve below the arbitrary floor target of 30% five A*-C GCSE passes, including English and mathematics. In Dudley we have four such schools, all serving challenging areas and all making great strides. None of these schools has been judged by Ofsted as failing. In two of the schools talented new headteachers have made a huge difference and the schools will be well over the floor target this year. One school is very small and we are proposing to merge it with another. The final school serves a challenging area and achieves excellent value-added and pupil progress. In all four cases we are considering academies or trusts, not because they are an automatic solution to the challenges faced by the schools, but because it will unlock substantial capital funding that would otherwise be unavailable to us. John Freeman Director of children's services, Dudley I think we should have serious doubts about the quality of Ed Balls's education, judging by the muddled conclusions he's reached on improving school standards. Part of the solution, it seems, is to give more money to expand the academy programme, in spite of the fact that 26 out of 46 academies have achieved GCSE results that put them into the \"failing\" category. My own children went to an inner London comprehensive that was routinely achieving GCSE A-C results of around 30% before it was replaced by two academies whose combined percentage score is now just over 20%. With education policy being driven by such blinkered ideology, I despair for the future of our next generation. Kate Francis London Simon Jenkins eloquently exposes the shambles of the government's academies programme (These are the teachings of wild intervention and vanity, June 11). What should not be overlooked, however, is that a great many schools taken out of the community sector by this ill-conceived programme are handed over to religious organisations, often leaving no alternative community school in the locality. What now of the much-vaunted mantra of \"choice\"? Does it not occur to the government that many people do not want to send their children to a school controlled by an organisation whose principal purpose is to persuade as many people as possible to accept its doctrine? People may worship, if they wish, at churches, mosques, synagogues and temples. Religion is not, however, education, and a school, lest we forget, is there to educate, not to indoctrinate. Mike Lim Bolton So local authority schools where fewer than 30% of students fail to gain five A-C GCSEs are to become academies. What are the plans for the various academies where fewer than 30% of students fail to gain five A-C GCSEs?
