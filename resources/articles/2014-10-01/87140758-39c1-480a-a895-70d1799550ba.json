The manager is confident that although his Dutch compatriot has scored only twice for him at United, the 31-year-old requires only luck to rediscover his prolific form. Yet Chelsea\u2019s arrival at Old Trafford on Sunday may be a last chance to prove himself before Wayne Rooney\u2019s return from a three-game suspension for the trip to Manchester City for the derby in the following match. Van Gaal is backing Van Persie to score against Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s side and he could certainly use a goal, although Radamel Falcao, Juan Mata, Adnan Januzaj and James Wilson also factor into this equation as the manager decides who should form his front three. Given that Rooney has what Van Gaal has called \u201cspecial privileges\u201d as captain and that Falcao was the club\u2019s star signing of the summer, if Van Persie continues to misfire he may come under threat. The former Arsenal striker has appeared sluggish so far, his two goals coming in seven starts. But Van Gaal still believes he is seeing the best of the man he appointed his Holland captain. \u201cI think he is more fit than ever,\u201d said the manager. \u201cHe don\u2019t score so much. In the Dutch team he has scored more than now for Manchester United and then he was not so fit as now. That\u2019s remarkable, but he scored in [almost] every game for me in the World Cup in spite of maybe his 80% fitness. He scored four goals out of six games and then also a penalty. So maybe now he is playing better but doesn\u2019t score as much.\u201d Van Persie\u2019s two goals this season came in consecutive outings \u2013 in the 5-3 reverse at Leicester City and the 2-1 home win over West Ham United \u2013 towards the end of September. On Monday evening, though, as United trailed 2-1 at West Bromwich Albion, Van Persie showed a flash of quality when using his weaker foot. \u201cHe\u2019s a little bit unlucky, like against West Bromwich Albion when he shot with right foot \u2013 it was hard to believe that that shot stayed out of the goal,\u201d the manager said. \u201cSo a striker needs also a bit of luck and then the confidence is higher but he\u2019s self-confident so I expect he shall score and maybe against Chelsea.\u201d So far Van Persie has remained injury free, which is a fillip after previously admitting to managing persistent issues for years. Perhaps this is why Van Gaal mentioned his fitness this term. Yet sooner or later age and his fragile physique will catch up with him. Last season Van Persie suffered nine separate injuries but still managed 12 goals in 18 Premier League starts. In the previous, title-winning year there were 26 in 35. These figures may be why the manager is adamant his star forward is not past his peak. \u201cHe has showed that at the World Cup and is showing that now except scoring goals but that is only a matter of time,\u201d said Van Gaal before outlining Van Persie\u2019s all-round contribution. \u201cEvery striker has to be at the attacking point. He has to play with the other 10 players. That is also important. That he is now doing better than in Dutch team.\u201d Van Gaal meanwhile believes that Diego Costa will appear for Chelsea. The Spain striker has a continuing hamstring issue and has been ill this week. But Van Gaal believes Mourinho will start him. \u201cI think that he shall play with him when he can because he wants to win. Of course he can play. He has trained individually, I have heard, I have read on the websites. I also have my eyes always open. He has scored nine out of seven, that is remarkable, so he is in a good shape I think but he was ill so you never know.\u201d \u00c1ngel di Mar\u00eda injured a thigh at West Brom but Van Gaal confirmed that he and Ander Herrera, who was also replaced, were available. \u201cAnder was already fit and, with Di Mar\u00eda, I said after the match that normally it [the injury] should not be so heavy and it\u2019s not heavy. \u201cSo he has trained. It was only the first day that he didn\u2019t train so he has trained from Thursday, no problem. I let Michael Carrick play this evening in London for the reserves [at West Ham] because I believe that he needs that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
