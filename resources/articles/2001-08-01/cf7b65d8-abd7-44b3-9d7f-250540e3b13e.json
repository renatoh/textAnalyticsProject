Hidden depths seem inevitable and sure enough a false back in that lonesome piece of furniture leads the double act in and out of the 20th century. There's a little war and a little assassination, all bound up with love, lots of cabaret costume changes (shoes making a strong bid for a star turn), and a soundtrack that allows most of the century's big guns in politics and musical culture a word. This hour of loosely narrative dance offers few major surprises but is full of charm. Sian Williams, star of the Kosh, the company she founded with Michael Merwitzer in 1982, is a perennially fit and indefatigable performer. Her partner on this occasion, Fiona Creese, is a perfect match. They swing through the century as an ever-changing couple, switching sex and character, laid back and easy. The steps they take are disarmingly simple, though they include snatches from all over - the ballroom, Spain, the circus, the disco. With 100 years to cover their remit is dizzyingly vast, but the pair seem unfazed. Their dance bumps up against shocking events such as Chernobyl and the killing of John Lennon but steers clear of shock tactics, keeping love in the air and a sense that this is entertainment. A seven-year-old joined us for the show and adored every minute of it. Until August 27. Box office: 0131-650 4403."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
