The novel opens in a nameless place somewhere in rural Australia where a group of 10 young women wake up, having been drugged and taken from their homes. We \u2013 and they \u2013 are left wondering why they are here (and where here even is). As the novel gallops along, it becomes clear these women have something in common \u2013 they\u2019ve each been involved in a high-profile sex scandal. The vibe is Margaret Atwood meets Wake in Fright. It\u2019s a rollicking read and unashamedly political. It explores how power, the media and the judiciary fight back when they are attacked. How they work against women is laid bare. You won\u2019t look at the world the same after reading this book. I don\u2019t know whether Melbourne\u2019s Abigail Ulman gets cross when she is compared to Lena Dunham but I mean it as a compliment. If anything, Ulman\u2019s girls are even darker than Dunham\u2019s Girls. Hot Little Hands (Penguin) is a collection of nine stories set in adolescence or on the cusp of adulthood. My favourite is Head to Toe where 16-year-olds Elise and Jenny lie around their suburban bedrooms in an advanced state of ennui. Even pornography and Kanye West can\u2019t rouse them from torpor \u2013 their energy only returns when they go off to horse camp. Ulman\u2019s great gift is for dialogue. She captures the way young men talk about porn, how BFFs converse like lovers and how children speak to their parents as if their parents were children. It\u2019s very good. There\u2019s also fun to be had in Paddy Manning\u2019s Born to Rule: The Unauthorised Biography of Malcolm Turnbull (MUP) because, well, the prime minister actually had quite a life before he entered politics. His mother, Carol Lansbury, was a well-known Sydney radio actor but left the family when Malcolm was young. He and his father moved into a flat in Sydney\u2019s east, without any furniture except for some chairs that once belonged to a dental surgery. Despite early battles, Turnbull flourished through a mixture of energy, intelligence and sheer chutzpah. Young Malcolm is a hilarious yet formidable figure, deftly painted by Manning who approaches his subject with a breezy but thorough working-over. At Sydney Grammar, when it was obvious Turnbull was going to be appointed school captain, a group of senior boys went to the headmaster to urge it be \u201canyone but Turnbull\u201d. He was appointed anyway. Those wondering just who our prime minister is should read this book. Brigid Delaney is a Guardian Australia writer and author Meredith Jaffe When Kate Grenville set out to record her mother Nance\u2019s life, she intended to take it to Officeworks and make five copies for the grandchildren. Fortunately for us, One Life: My Mother\u2019s Story (Text) was published. While this biography is a deeply personal document, it captures the life of an extraordinary woman ahead of her time. Nance studied pharmacy at Sydney University and went on to open her own pharmacies on the northern beaches. She laid the foundations for the family home in Mona Vale, juggled parenthood, a difficult marriage and a troubled relationship with her own mother, embittered by her own lack of opportunities and education. As you\u2019d expect of Grenville, this is a poignant and lyrical work. It\u2019s hard to go past Magda Szubanski\u2019s memoir Reckoning (Text). This is no celebrity expos\u00e9; very little mention is made of her career. Reckoning explores the factors that shaped Szubanski as a child and young woman. From her father\u2019s wartime experiences as an assassin for the Polish underground to the rich vein of comedy snaking through her mother\u2019s Scottish-Irish heritage, Szubanski explores the sometimes agonising reconciliation of self. The writing is superb, if unexpected from a person whose career has been shaped around snappy one-liners. It is impossible not to be moved by her experiences of recognising and accepting her sexuality and the impact it had on those she loves. Let\u2019s hope Szubanski writes more. She shines just as brightly as a serious writer as she does as a comedian. David Rain\u2019s Volcano Street (Atlantic) flew under the radar when it was released this time last year. Set in a fictionalised version of his hometown of Mount Gambier in South Australia, this is the story of sisters Marlo and Skip who are sent to Aunt Noreen\u2019s in Crater Lakes after their mother is sectioned. It\u2019s an exquisite coming of age story that resonates with the feel of the British empire whilst embracing new voices and the changes they bring. In some ways, it reads like a love song to Rain\u2019s own childhood, only able to be told now via the distance of time and geography \u2013 a quintessential Australian novel. Debra Adelaide\u2019s The Women\u2019s Pages (Picador) began as a short story in her collection Letter to George Clooney and brings together Adelaide\u2019s ideas about the contract between readers and writers, and how some books, in this case Wuthering Heights, can stay with us forever. It\u2019s an intriguing tale in which missing, absent and dead mothers are the core. The complexity of the plot and narrative demonstrate why Adelaide is one of our best contemporary writers. She lures the reader in with two stories then brings them together in a stunning climax that questions the divide between reality and fiction. Meredith Jaffe is an author and Guardian Australia critic Emma Froggatt My mum always said that when you read Tim Winton, you need to do so in a quiet place so you can hear the poetry of his prose. It\u2019s true too of his recent \u201clandscape memoir\u201d Island Home (Penguin), which charts the land that has haunted his writing over the past 30 years. There\u2019s something quiet, magical, almost spiritual about Winton\u2019s sense of place; each of his books has grown my desire to explore Winton\u2019s Western Australia and swim off its coastline, which always seems tinted with a clearer shade of blue-green. Here, Winton identifies what it means to be Australian. When first attempting to get published, Winton had to cast his mind to cosmopolitan readers and estrange himself from the native landscape whose stories he actually wanted to tell. Now, he argues, while our lives are increasingly defined by the political and ideological, and increasingly conducted in offices and online, there is much to be learned from the Australian landscape and its original peoples. This book may influence your politics \u2013 from the ground up. In The Simple Act of Reading (Random House), Debra Adelaide has pulled together some of Australia\u2019s best authors to reflect on what is arguably a writer\u2019s favourite subject: reading. In support of the Sydney Story Factory, Joan London, David Malouf, Malcolm Knox, Kate Forsyth, Delia Falconer are among those mapping the impact of literature on their worlds. Take Thea Astea: books delivered to her central Australian home once a month brought literal new cities and lands to an otherwise vast and remote landscape. Emma Froggatt works on the Guardian Australia culture desk Sam Twyford-Moore This year has been a dog for most people I know: deaths, trauma, illness, psychotic breakdowns abounded around my friends and colleagues \u2013 but as ever books were there to console. It started well with our best literary magazine the Lifted Brow welcoming in the new year with a new format and three insanely talented co-editors \u2013 Gillian Terzis, Steph Van Schilt and Ellena Savage, all formidable writers in their own right \u2013 taking the underrated magazine in strange directions across its four issues. And now the Brow is branching into publishing. Then, one of Australia\u2019s closest neighbours, Indonesia, gave us Eka Kurniawan whose two novels in translation \u2013 Beauty is a Wound and Man Tiger (Text) \u2013 are the two best works of fiction of the year but may not be discovered for another year by local audiences as word slowly builds. Finally, there was Fiona Wright\u2019s Small Acts of Disappearance: Essays on Hunger (Giramondo), to my mind the most important Australian work of nonfiction to be produced this decade. A book on illness that is decidedly and literally life-giving \u2013 it could well save lives. Wright looks honestly at her own personal traumas and how they have shaped her life as a woman and as a reader and as a writer. It is simply, purely a significant act and deserves the widest readership of all.
