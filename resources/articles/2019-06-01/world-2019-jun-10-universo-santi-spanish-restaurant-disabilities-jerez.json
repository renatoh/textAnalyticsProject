It\u2019s only later that you realise there is something different, and a little special, about Universo Santi, a restaurant in the southern Spanish city of Jerez. \u201cPeople don\u2019t come here because the staff are disabled but because it\u2019s the best restaurant in the area. Whatever reason they came for, the talking is about the food,\u201d says Antonio Vila. Vila is the president of the Fundaci\u00f3n Universo Accesible, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to helping people with disabilities join the mainstream workforce. He has also been the driving force behind Universo Santi, the haute cuisine restaurant whose 20 employees all have some form of disability. \u201cI always wanted to show what people with disabilities, given the right training, were capable of,\u201d says Vila, who is a senior manager at DKV insurance. \u201cThey were not represented in the world of haute cuisine. Universo Santi has broken through that barrier.\u201d The 20 staff, whose ages range from 22 to 62, were recruited from an original list of 1,500. To qualify, applicants had to be unemployed and have more than 35% disability. \u201cI feel really lucky to be part of this,\u201d says Gloria Baz\u00e1n, head of human resources, who has cerebral palsy. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to work when society just sees you as someone with a handicap. This has given me the opportunity to be independent and to participate like any other human being.\u201d Alejandro Gim\u00e9nez, 23, has Down\u2019s syndrome and is a commis chef. \u201cIt\u2019s given me the chance to become independent doing something I\u2019ve loved since I was a kid,\u201d says Gim\u00e9nez, who lived with his mother until he was recruited. \u201cWorking here has transformed my life. So many things I used to ask my mother to do, I do myself. I didn\u2019t even know how to take a train by myself because I\u2019d just miss my stop.\u201d A recent guest chef was Joan Roca of El Celler de Can Roca, twice voted the best restaurant in the world. Gim\u00e9nez said he was not daunted at coming under Roca\u2019s orders. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of anything. The only thing I\u2019m afraid of is not knowing something. I always want to learn and here I\u2019m learning from the very best.\u201d Universo Santi may soon have a star in the Michelin firmament as the Michelin Guide people have already sampled the menu which, at \u20ac60 (\u00a353), is less than half the price of a typical men\u00fa de degustaci\u00f3n. \u201cOf course they didn\u2019t introduce themselves but we knew who they were,\u201d says Almudena Merlo, the ma\u00eetre d\u2019. While few are as gastronomically ambitious as Universo Santi, there are several other projects across Europe where catering is giving disabled people a new lease of life. One is La Fourchette de Collserola in Barcelona, which is staffed by 20 people with a range of physical and mental disabilities. The cuisine is Mediterranean, with vegan and kosher options. In 2010 Brownies&amp;downieS launched in the Dutch town of Veghel as a caf\u00e9 run by people with Down\u2019s syndrome and other disabilities. It was so successful that the venture became a franchise, with 53 branches in the Netherlands, Belgium and South Africa. Another similar project is the One Eighty Restaurant in Portadown, Northern Ireland, which was established in 2011 and trains 16- to 22-year-olds with learning difficulties to work in the hospitality business. The Jerez restaurant takes its name from Santi Santamaria, chef at the Michelin three-star Can Fabes in Catalonia until his sudden death in 2011. Can Fabes closed shortly afterwards but his family wanted to carry on his name and culinary tradition and were keen to support the Jerez project. The family\u2019s enthusiasm attracted the attention of Spain\u2019s top chefs, among them Mart\u00edn Berasategui, Roca and \u00c1ngel Le\u00f3n, all of whom have contributed recipes and their time as guest chefs at the restaurant. Disciples of Santamaria helped establish the kitchen, whose equipment was transferred in its entirely from Can Fabes, and several of the dishes on the menu de degustaci\u00f3n are Santamaria originals. Since it opened in October 2017, Universo Santi continues to win plaudits for its cuisine. Speaking at the restaurant, Roca said cooking was about humanity and was a way of integrating people. \u201cIt gives me great satisfaction to see it realised in a project such as this,\u201d he said.
