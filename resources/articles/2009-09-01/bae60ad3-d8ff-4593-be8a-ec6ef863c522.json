He makes a lovely Cedric, a snakey character slithering into Arthur's affections in order to nick a big blue jewel. Trouble is, it's not a jewel, but the soul of Cornelius Sigan, a seriously bad dude from the past who has vowed to bring down Camelot. All Cornelius needs is a body to take over, so as soon as Cedric shows up, in he goes, and the parasite soul sets to work, causing trouble and messing with people's minds. I'm wondering if Cornelius is an early incarnation of Derren Brown: they have a similar way of operating, and the same darkness about them. Ravens are attracted to them both. And yes, because Derren was obviously also trying to bring down Camelot, by predicting the lottery numbers, it all fits in to place. One mystery solved. I do wish Uther Pendragon would start believing in magic. Look around you man, your own stone statues are coming to life, turning into winged bat monsters (Derren's army) \u2013 it's obvious there's some serious sorcery going on. Quite scary, those bat things. Unlike the wild boar in the woods, which looks like a big CGI guinea pig. Merlin himself \u2013 Colin Morgan \u2013 is quite cuddly, too. And it's nice to have some family fun again on a Saturday night. I don't have much of a family myself, but I do have a girlfriend, in her mid-30s, and she loves it. There's something called Camelot in Trinity (ITV2, Sunday), too, some kind of wicked secret society, I think \u2013 no doubt Derren's involved again. More thrillingly, there are lots of beautiful young people hopping in and out of bed with each other. Meanwhile, a couple of idiot stoners huddle in a wheely bin as arrogant sloanes with posh floppy hair exercise an ancient privilege by peeing on them. We're at a collegiate university, it's very, very silly, Porterhouse Blue meets There's Something About Mary, that kind of thing. It's early days I know, but I think it looks quite promising. In Kevin McCloud's Grand Tour (Channel 4, Sunday) the Grand Designs man is off in the footsteps of the posh, floppy-haired young men who used to go touring and whoring round Europe in the olden days. It was a rite of passage, just as the TV travelogue is now a rite of passage for the 21st-century TV presenter. To get into the spirit of things, Kevin gets drunk, sleeps with unsuitable women, and fritters away his enormous fortune (from several series of Grand Designs) as he meanders round Europe. Unfortunately none of this makes the final edit. We do see him getting a little bit involved, though: being suited and booted in Paris to look the part, trying out frogs' legs, and at least speaking to a Genoese prostitute. He's a good guide, striking just the right balance between doing and telling, trying things out for himself and explaining stuff. And of course he's particularly good at architecture, though I saw the recent BBC4 Palladio documentary, so I knew all that already \u2013 the Greek influence, the special proportions, Palladio's influence via Inigo Jones in Britain etc. Come to think of it, I think Brian Sewell did a Grand Tour programme, Brian Sewell's Grand Tour, a couple of years ago, didn't he? Let's have some new ideas. The loveliest views of the weekend were in Munro: Mountain Man (BBC4, Sunday) - of Sgurr Alasdair, Beinn Tarsuinn, Sgorr Ruadh and Spidean Mialach. These are just a few of Scotland's peaks over 3,000 ft, of which there are 284. There's a good story to go with them, too. A Victorian gentleman mountaineer, Sir Hugh Munro, climbing at night so as not to upset the local lairds, is methodically measuring and cataloguing his mountains. Then an eccentric vicar, the Rev Archie Robertson, joins the race to do the same. Rev Archie wins it, too, but mainly because of a loophole in the rules \u2013 something about what does and doesn't constitute a summit that I couldn't get too worked up about, to be honest. Gorgeous scenery, though. And now thousands of funny people with brightly coloured outdoor clothing and maps in plastic mapholders follow in their footsteps, ticking them off. Munro bagging, it's called. No one knows why they do it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
