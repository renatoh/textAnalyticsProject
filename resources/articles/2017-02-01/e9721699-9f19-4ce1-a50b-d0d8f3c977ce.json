That\u2019s the size of his share of the cut to Sunday penalty rates ordered on Thursday by the Fair Work Commission, a name that must seem Orwellian to the hundreds of thousands of workers in the retail, fast food, hospitality and pharmacy industries. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive kick in the teeth for me and countless workers,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of the most vulnerable workers are told to tighten their belts and get better jobs by politicians who don\u2019t rely on penalty rates and can fly around in helicopters if they want \u2013 it\u2019s contemptible.\u201d But that\u2019s exactly what Azlan plans to do \u2013 get out of the hospitality industry before the cuts take effect, as they are phased in over a number of years from 1 July. Azlan works a 35-hour week in the pub, including every Sunday, but to cope with the decision he will take on more freelance work as a graphic designer and retrain, if he can. He counts himself lucky that he doesn\u2019t have children to support or a mortgage, suggesting that big cuts to take-home pay could create serious problems for others. The Australian Council of Trade Unions has calculated that the worst off will be casuals in the pharmacy industry, who face cuts of up to $6,000 a year. Azlan, a member of the hospitality union United Voice, plans to fight back. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve always tried to agitate in my workplace \u2013 to get others to join the union,\u201d he says. \u201cThe labour movement isn\u2019t as strong as it used to be, unfortunately. That\u2019s what we need to fight back: we need more people joining their unions.\u201d Tim Lyons, a research fellow at the Per Capita think-tank and former assistant secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, agrees. He says the pay cut is a political issue and the government deserves to be attacked because it wanted penalty rates to be cut. \u201cBut the solution is not political \u2013 it\u2019s a workplace issue. The answer is not to send a petition to the prime minister.\u201d Lyons calls the penalty rate cut \u201cthe greatest workplace organising opportunity in 20 years\u201d because it gives unions a chance to recruit members and fight back directly against pay cuts. \u201cIt\u2019s not compulsory for employers to cut pay, there\u2019s no reason employers can\u2019t sign a letter promising they won\u2019t cut workers\u2019 rates of pay on a Sunday,\u201d he says. Unions should be helping workers either negotiate enterprise agreements or simple one-page agreements committing not to implement the cut, he says. The cosmetic retailer Lush, which employs people on the retail award and common law contracts of employment, has already committed not to cut penalty rates in line with the decision. In a statement on Thursday, Lush\u2019s Australia and New Zealand directors Peta Granger and Mark Lincoln said that applying the Fair Work ruling was a choice and promised that their employees would not be adversely affected by the decision. \u201cWe believe that those making the sacrifice to work on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays deserve to be fairly compensated,\u201d they said. Lyons says other employers may follow suit, in the hope of attracting and retaining quality staff. But the biggest surprise about the Fair Work Commission decision, according to him, is that it was made not just with employees in mind but also consumers. The commission was persuaded by evidence from business owners that the current level of Sunday rates had led them to restrict trading hours, reduce staff levels and curtail the services provided. Cutting rates would therefore increase trading hours, and the \u201clevel and range of services\u201d on Sunday and public holidays, the commission president Justice Iain Ross had said. But Lyons says: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the Fair Work Act with respect to community access to services. As far as I can see, that\u2019s clearest bit of new jurisprudence from the decision.\u201d The commission also found there could be \u201csome positive employment effects\u201d from a penalty rate cut, although it couldn\u2019t be certain how big. Small business owner Kate Mizerski says she works all day on Sundays and uses \u201cthe cheapest labour I can find\u201d. \u201cIf penalty rates are brought back in line with Saturday rates, I can afford to give the older employees shifts,\u201d she says. \u201cIf they don\u2019t want to work for that wage, then don\u2019t; they\u2019re not forced to. But small business owners are struggling too and if we go down, there\u2019s more jobs lost.\u201d But while the impact on employment is yet to be determined, retailers are already counting on the prospect of increased profit. As Guardian Australia reported in November, financial analysts calculate that a decrease in penalty rates would increase the profits of big retailers or result in tiny reductions in consumer prices. According to Citi Research, a division of Citigroup, cutting Sunday penalty rates from double-time to time-and-a-half would increase earnings per share by up to 8% for Myer and JB Hi-Fi, and 5% for Wesfarmers, if retailers retained the benefits. The Citi document noted that most big retailers, including Big W, Bunnings, Just Group, Kmart, Target and Myer, had expired enterprise agreements. It suggested they might be waiting in \u201chope that wage reform will be implemented, lowering penalty rates\u201d. The Fair Work Commission cut to award penalty rates has exposed another feature of the Australian industrial relations landscape \u2013 employees covered by collective enterprise agreements are not affected. The chief executive of the Council of Small Business Australia, Peter Strong, says that because 80% of workers in affected sectors are employed by big businesses such as Coles, Woolworths and McDonald\u2019s, which have enterprise agreements, they will not be directly affected by the decision. Labor realised this in a major embarrassment when it chose a young Coles worker to highlight the effect of the cuts, while his pay is set by an enterprise agreement. But the national secretary of the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA), Gerard Dwyer, tells Guardian Australia that while the decision will not immediately affect employees on an enterprise agreement, \u201cit will flow through in their long-term wage outcomes\u201d. While the SDA already accepts the lower 150% penalty rate on a Sunday in its agreement, Dwyer says it does so in return for higher base rates of pay and other conditions. \u201cThose take-home pay packages will be adversely affected ... it\u2019s fair to say that pay rates are now under pressure. The outcomes we can achieve are not going to be as high as if the award rates were not cut. \u201cThat\u2019s how it will express itself at the bargaining table \u2013 the benchmark for an agreement and an overall package has been lowered.\u201d The National Retailers Association chief executive, Dominique Lamb, who welcomes the decision, agrees that \u201cany change to the minimum wage would be considered in enterprise bargaining\u201d. \u201cAnything that employers can use to ensure that they are in best position to trade is something that will come into their minds in negotiations, but agreements still have to leave workers better off overall so they will still be fair.\u201d For Lyons, the fact workers covered by SDA agreements will be shielded from a pay cut is \u201cvery telling\u201d and he thinks it and the United Voice union should be looking to build their membership in non-unionised sectors of the hospitality and retail sectors with the promise of such protection. But the more radical upstart Retail and Fast Food Workers Union (RAFFWU) takes a different view on big SDA enterprise agreements. Its secretary, Josh Cullinan, says the agreements \u201csold out\u201d workers\u2019 penalty rates, and the landmark Coles case shows that two-thirds of workers will be better off under the award. \u201cOur model is not particularly secret, we intend to apply to the commission to terminate the agreements of all major retail and fast food outlets. \u201cWorkers will still be better off on the award than the agreements they are currently on, but yesterday\u2019s announcement would have a devastating effect on them by reducing their Sunday rates.\u201d Cullinan says that if the half a million workers now covered by large retail agreements return to the award and are better off, it will build a political constituency against the commission\u2019s cuts. \u201cThey will be looking at these pay cuts with a different view \u2013 we\u2019ll involve them in the process and no politician will be able to hide from these cuts.\u201d Dwyer denies that the SDA sold out workers. He says companies\u2019 wage bills overall were higher under their agreements than the award, proving workers were better off overall. \u201cThe RAFFWU campaign to cancel enterprise agreements and revert to the award, which is now facing even more cuts, is completely illogical.\u201d The ACTU is planning a campaign around penalty rates. The ACTU president, Ged Kearney, says it will first demand that workers\u2019 current rates of pay are protected and then that decisions such as Thursday\u2019s \u201ccannot be made in future\u201d. Labor and the Greens have developed policies to prevent a repeat of the decision. Under a bill released by the Greens on Friday, penalty rates will be frozen at the level at the start of 2017, meaning the most recent cut will never take effect. \u201cThe Greens want parliament to act urgently before the FWC makes legally binding orders that will smash many of our lowest-paid and youngest workers,\u201d the Greens industrial relations spokesman, Adam Bandt, says. \u201cCoffees won\u2019t become cheaper on Sundays and there won\u2019t be golden flowing rivers of new jobs, but many people will find it much harder to pay the rent.\u201d Labor proposes that cuts to penalty rates should be accompanied by beneficial pay and conditions so workers are not left worse off. Kearney says the independent umpire \u201cmakes decisions based on the rules which are laid out in our laws\u201d. \u201cIf it is possible for this commission, which was established to protect the rights of workers, to cut their pay, then obviously changes need to be made to those laws.\u201d She warns that if the system doesn\u2019t change, workers in disability and homeless support services, emergency service workers and nurses \u201ccould be next\u201d. \u201cThese are all sectors that rely heavily on penalty rates.\u201d The employment minister, Michaelia Cash, has rejected the union\u2019s contention as a \u201cscare campaign\u201d, noting that the commission\u2019s decision affects only six of 122 modern awards. According to the commission, retail and hospitality industries have a number of \u201cdistinguishing characteristics\u201d, including that consumers expect those services on weekends. But Lyons warns that \u201cone of the most worrying aspects of the decision\u201d is that if one of the objectives is to make services available out of hours, \u201cthat could apply to anyone\u201d. One worker who fears he will be next is Tomas Hamilton. He works in a club and faces cuts only to public holiday rates, because clubs have been spared from Sunday rate cuts. The cut of $60 or $70 every public holiday means he will have \u201cless disposable income and I don\u2019t have much in the first place\u201d, he says. \u201cBut the reason people are panicking is that they know we\u2019ll be next. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before they come for our Sunday rates and then possibly Saturday rates will be next.\u201d Meanwhile, there are hundreds of thousands of workers in Azlan\u2019s position weighing their options \u2013 ranging from make do with less, move into a different industry, or organise to demand that employers don\u2019t pass on the cuts. The Turnbull government insists that the ruling of the independent umpire must be respected, and the crossbench, so far, shows no desire to interfere with it either. But the size and scale of the cuts may prove a powerful motivator for working people to get more involved in the politics of parliament and the workplace."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
