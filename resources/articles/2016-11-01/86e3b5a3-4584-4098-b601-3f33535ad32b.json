It\u2019s not long before it\u2019s deuce, though. At one point, the racket flies out of Nishikori\u2019s hand as he tries in vain to contain Djokovic. It\u2019s no use. Djokovic earns a match point with a forehand winner. Another stunning forehand wraps up a hugely impressive victory for Djokovic in 66 minutes.He will face Andy Murray for the title tomorrow. The winner finishes the year as the world No1. That match will probably be more interesting than this one. Thanks for reading. Bye. Second set: Djokovic* 6-1, 5-1 Nishikori (*denotes server): Djokovic holds to love. This is tiresome. Second set: Djokovic 6-1, 4-1 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Djokovic is still making a couple of strange errors at times, but overall he looks like he\u2019s getting his mojo back. Still, Nishikori does well to fight back from 0-30, a couple of aces making it 40-30. He holds to 30 when Djokovic sends a backhand long. Second set: Djokovic* 6-1, 4-0 Nishikori (*denotes server): \u201cCome on!\u201d barks Djokovic as he holds to 15. Don\u2019t worry, this will be over soon. Second set: Djokovic 6-1, 3-0 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Nishikori is desperately scrapping, desperately trying to preserve his dignity, saving two break points to force deuce. But he can\u2019t really hurt Djokovic, who breaks when Nishikori makes a complete mess of a forehand. Second set: Djokovic* 6-1, 2-0 Nishikori (*denotes server): Djokovic holds to 15. As Saturday night entertainment goes, this isn\u2019t that invigorating. Second set: Djokovic 6-1, 1-0 Nishikori* (*denotes server): It\u2019s difficult to see how Nishikori can make any meaningful impact in this match whatsoever. Djokovic was untouchable in the first set and it\u2019s not long before he has two break points at the start of the second. He takes the second thanks to some punishing groundstrokes. The first set looks like it\u2019s going to be in the bag for Djokovic after half an hour. He earns two set points when Nishikori frames a forehand. But the world No5 saves them with crisp forehand winners and improbably earns a break point with a lovely, precise backhand down the line. Djokovic hits back with an ace, but another backhand winner from Nishikori follows. But Djokovic hits back with an ace and quickly earns a third set point. There\u2019s no escape for Nishikori this time. Djokovic moves a set away from a final against Andy Murray when Nishikori sends a forehand wide. First set: Djokovic 5-1 Nishikori* (*denotes server): Djokovic\u2019s returns have been so sharp and that\u2019s making it so tough for Nishikori, whose serve isn\u2019t the strongest. Soon it\u2019s 0-30. Nishikori fights back to 30-all, but Djokovic quickly earns a break point, his groundstrokes dripping with acidic intent. Djokovic hangs in the rally and hooks a defensive lob into play. Nishikori trundles back, watches it drop inside the baseline and plonks a pathetic smash into the net. First set: Djokovic* 4-1 Nishikori (*denotes server): Is Djokovic back? That\u2019s what I\u2019m wondering at 40-15. But Nishikori shows good spirit to nail a backhand return and the game goes to deuce, Djokovic knocking a backhand wide. A wild forehand from Djokovic gifts Nishikori a break point and he grabs one of the breaks back when the world No2 nets a forehand. After 23 minutes, Nishikori is on the board. First set: Djokovic 4-0 Nishikori* (*denotes server): This is threatening to turn ugly, with Djokovic yawning a little bit and strolling into a 0-30 lead. He earns three break points, crashing a forehand down the line, skipping forward to dab the ball out of reach. Nishikori saves the first with an ace. Another scorching forehand return from Djokovic sees him grab the double break, though. First set: Djokovic* 3-0 Nishikori (*denotes server): Looking to consolidate the break, Djokovic rattles into a 30-0 lead with an ace. He holds to 15. This is worryingly one-sided at the moment. First set: Djokovic 2-0 Nishikori* (*denotes server): After that strange little episode, Nishikori gets this game underway and finds himself trailing 15-30 after a couple of tight backhands. Something must be in the air. Djokovic knocks a backhand return long to make it 30-all. Perking up a bit, Nishikori pings an ace down the middle to lead 40-30, but the game goes to deuce and Djokovic earns a break point when Nishikori nets a tepid forehand. He saves it with a swerving backhand down the line, but Djokovic is piling on the pressure and earns a second opportunity when Nishikori sends a forehand long. Nishikori promptly double faults. Someone has just tried to run on court and has quickly been apprehended by security. They\u2019ve bundled him away. What a berk. First set: Djokovic* 1-0 Nishikori (*denotes server): Novak Djokovic opens the serving, then, and quickly establishes a 40-15 lead after a few low-key points. He holds thanks to a rasping backhand. Djokovic won the toss and chose to serve. We\u2019ll be underway in a minute. Tok! Tok! Tok! It\u2019s time for the players to knock up. Here come the players! What\u2019s it to be? A Djokovic procession or a Nishikori upset? If this match is half as good as this afternoon\u2019s, it\u2019ll be special. Hello. It took Andy Murray a mere three hours and 38 minutes to book his place in tomorrow\u2019s final. What do Novak Djokovic and Kei Nishikori have in store for us now? We could be in for another treat. Djokovic knows that he will be one match away from regaining the No1 ranking if he sets up a Sunday evening bout with his old rival, while Nishikori will be looking to beat the Serb for the first time since winning their US Open semi-final in 2014. However he\u2019s lost his past nine matches against Djokovic, including two defeats here, and will be all too aware that the world No2 gradually appears to be looking more like his old self.
