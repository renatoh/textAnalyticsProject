Davies, who went missing last Monday, had been the victim of a \u201cbrutal and prolonged\u201d attack, said police, with a post-mortem examination confirming the cause of death as stab wounds and asphyxiation. His body was discovered by a dog walker at about 5.30pm on Wednesday off Parbold Hill near the village of Parbold. Police said Davies had \u201cnumerous and significant injuries\u201d. A 17-year-old youth from Chorley who was arrested on Friday has been charged with his murder, Lancashire police said on Sunday night. He has been remanded in custody and is due to appear at Preston magistrates court, sitting at Preston crown court, on Monday. Davies, from Skelmersdale, was declared a missing person on 30 April. The last confirmed sighting of him was at about 2pm on 29 April near a railway bridge on Station Road in Parbold. Police said his family had been informed and were being supported by officers. DCI Geoff Hurst, of Lancashire police\u2019s major investigation team, said: \u201cMy thoughts and the thoughts of every member of the team that have worked on this inquiry are with Alex\u2019s family and friends at this exceptionally tragic and difficult time. \u201cI am aware of the huge impact this crime has had on the community of Parbold, but I am heartened at the way that same community has pulled together and been so respectful to Alex, his family and to my officers who have been out trying to find the evidence that we need. \u201cWhile a youth has been charged, our inquiries will still continue in the Parbold and Chorley areas and I would urge you to continue supporting the investigating officers.\u201d Friends have paid tributes to Davies, who worked at Home Bargains and was a rail enthusiast, describing him as a kind friend. Ian Hardman told the Liverpool Echo: \u201cThe occasions I met up with Alex would be generally through the coincidence of wanting to go and see a particular special train, be it steam or diesel or something a little unusual.\u201d Police are appealing for anyone with dashboard camera footage from the Parbold Hill area taken between 1pm and 5.30pm on Monday 29 April \u2013 particularly if it shows cyclists on mountain bikes \u2013 to come forward."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
