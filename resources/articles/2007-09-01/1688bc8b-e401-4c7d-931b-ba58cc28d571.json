The Paraguay international, who expected to lead the line in tonight's Uefa Cup first round first leg away to Greek Cup winners Larissa, has been an immediate success following his \u00a33.8m move from Bayern Munich. Hughes said: \"Roque has proved in the short space of time we've had with him that he is a top quality striker,\" said Hughes. \"The price I was able to acquire him for makes him one of the best buys of the summer, if not for many summers.\" Christopher Samba is Hughes' only absentee for the tie at the Panthessaliko Stadium in Volos due to concussion sustained in Saturday's draw at Chelsea. Lee seeks respite from domestic woes in Skopje Sammy Lee's struggling Bolton Wanderers go into their opening Uefa Cup match against Rabotnicki in Macedonia tonight in desperate need of kick-starting their season. Midfielder Mikel Alonso admitted: \"We are all in the same ship and the manager is doing his best. He has confidence in us and while it is clear we have not had a very good start, the Uefa Cup is a different experience.\" Defender Andy O'Brien is expected to be fit for tonight's match in Skopje against Rabotnicki, who lie second in their league. It was feared O'Brien may have damaged a hamstring in the weekend defeat by Birmingham but the problem turned out to be severe cramp. Calderwood calls on back line to tighten up for Dnipro Aberdeen's manager Jimmy Calderwood has called on his players to solve the uncharacteristic defensive failings that have blighted their season so far, ahead of the first leg of the tie with Ukrainian side Dnipro at Pittodrie.\"In Saturday's game against Motherwell we started very sloppily and paid for it,\" he said. \"If we do this on Thursday we will suffer the consequences.\" Calderwood's defence will be boosted by the presence of Jackie McNamara, despite the former Celtic player losing two teeth in the Motherwell match."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
