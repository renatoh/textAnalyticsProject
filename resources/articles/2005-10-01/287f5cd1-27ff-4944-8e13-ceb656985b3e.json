The British road and rail transport operator is paying \u00a3262m in shares and cash for Alsa, a family-owned company founded more than 200 years ago, and taking on \u00a3199m in debt. The deal will give Alsa's owners, the Cosmen family, headed by 77-year-old patriarch Pepe, a 9.9% stake in National Express Group, which they have agreed to keep for two years, as well as a seat on the board. The Cosmens said they intend to increase their stake to 15%, which would make them the biggest shareholders in the group, \"subject to market conditions\". National Express chief executive Phil White said he had been waiting six years to clinch the deal with Alsa, with which the UK company already has links. \"It's a very special relationship between the family and a listed company. We knew the quality right from the start,\" he said. Alsa, which Mr White said began life as a donkey and cart operation 200 years ago, has a 1,400-strong fleet of vehicles as well as bus operations in a number of Spanish cities. Alsa would be run by local management as a division within the group, Mr White said, but National Express would look to apply the management model it developed from low-cost airlines to Alsa to increase revenues. \"This is a fantastic growth opportunity. Alsa operates concessions running from between eight and 20 years with an average life of nine years, so this is like us buying a firm with a nine-year order book.\" Last year Alsa made a profit before interest and taxation of \u00a330m on a turnover of \u00a3219m and revenue has been growing at 6% a year for the last three years. National Express is hoping the acquisition will put it in a position to benefit from the expected liberalisation of bus services in a number of Spain's leading cities, using its own experience in the UK and Alsa's public/private sector partnership in Majorca. The UK group, which has 45,000 employees and includes rail services such as the Gatwick Express and Travel West Midlands alongside its distinctive white coaches, is also looking at the opportunities that might be offered by further privatisation of Spanish rail services."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
