Many developing countries, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa, do not have social services programmes. So how does the village raise the child or provide care for the elderly in the absence of governmental agencies? Traditionally, in African communities, social needs and social problems were addressed by the family (nuclear and extended) or the clan. It is common for neighbours or religious organisations to provide assistance. In Nigeria, the traditional extended family support system and welfare system exist side by side, with important differences between rural and urban regions. My research explored indigenous knowledge, beliefs and social care practices with children and the family in Nigeria. It found that native communities have systems and practices that ensure the continuity of life and enhance the wellbeing of the people. Such practices include naming and marriage ceremonies, indigenous micro-financing, age accountability groups, and informal adoption of children and the elderly by relatives. These practices are informed by strong beliefs in the spiritual dimensions of the human existence and see social care as an obligation not just to people but to the gods. These underlying beliefs drive indigenous social care.
