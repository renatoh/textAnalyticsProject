Grainger, who took charge of the UK funding body for Olympic sports last year after retiring from rowing following the Rio Games, also warned the International Olympic Committee that the public would lose faith in sport if cheats did not face harsh sanctions. \u201cWhat doping steals from athletes is irreplaceable,\u201d said Grainger, speaking from experience, having initially lost a 2006 world championship medal to a Russian crew that was subsequently banned. \u201cAnd when it happens time and time again, on that scale, then you realise that maybe the punishments haven\u2019t been serious enough in the past and things need to change.\u201d After agreeing that the IOC\u2019s decision to allow some Russians to compete as Olympic Athletes from Russia was \u201ca fudge\u201d, Grainger was asked for her likely reaction if any British competitors lost out to Russians in Pyeongchang. \u201cYou can imagine how we will feel,\u201d she replied. \u201cThere\u2019s a very, very strong argument that there should be no Russians there \u2013 at all. \u201cBecause when the public lose trust in a system, a sport or a country, as they have done with Russia, it reflects badly on all sport.\u201d Meanwhile, British Olympic chiefs and UK Sport defended the \u00a332m funding of Winter Olympic sports after targeting their best-ever performance in Pyeongchang. UK Sport has set a medal target of at least five medals \u2013 one better than in Sochi in 2014 \u2013 and says that, if all goes to plan, 10 medals were possible. However, questions were raised about the levels of funding for winter sports given that so few people take part in them in Britain. Skeleton, for instance, gets \u00a36.5m over four years but is expected to get only one medal. UK Sport\u2019s chief executive, Liz Nicholl, defended the funding and said the nation benefited when British athletes made the podium. \u201cWe will always focus on the medal moment to make everyone proud and to create a healthy, ambitious and active nation,\u201d she said. \u201cI am really confident there will be smiles on our faces as we watch through the Pyeongchang Olympics and Paralympics. And, relatively, it is a smaller amount of money compared to what we put into the summer sports.\u201d Bill Sweeney, the chief executive of the British Olympic Association, pointed to the success of cycling to show how public attitudes have changed \u2013 and claimed the same thing could happen in winter sports. \u201cIf you had said 15 years ago that we would ever be a cycling nation, you would probably have thought no way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there has been a lot of investment and we have seen some amazing success inside and outside the Olympic Games. \u201cI think that logic applies to the snow sportsIf you look at slopestyle and alpine skiing and snowboarding, I see a lot of kids going to Europe to participate in that. And winning medals makes a difference.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
