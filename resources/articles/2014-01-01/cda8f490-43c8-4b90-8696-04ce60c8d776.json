What, I ask New York Times restaurant critic Pete Wells, is currently stimulating the world's most easily-jaded city? Northern Thai, he says. So we have fiery larb at Zabb Elee and catfish paste at Uncle Boons. Or omakase: I beg and plead for a reservation at Sushi Nakazawa, but no dice. This is a tough town. Or the tasting-only menu at the likes of Torrisi Italian Specialties. I do something I never do and try to pull strings (well, when in Rome), a move that gets me booted on to the Little Italy sidewalk by a sharp-suited snoot. No table, wounded amour-propre and eater.com headlines of the Guardian Restaurant Critic Snubbed variety. Told you: tough town. So Blanca scares me. A formerly semi-secret adjunct to deservedly-praised Roberta's in gritty Bushwick, where the cast of Girls nosh on magnificent sourdough pizzas and nouvelle-Brooklyn cuisine. It's going to be so up itself, it can examine its own fillings, surely? Just accessing it is a palaver: past graffiti and street kids to Roberta's front desk for a brief languish in the craft beer and beardy tiki bar, then through a dark yard filled with herb-planted hyrdoponic containers. It takes the husband back to his raving days. Where Roberta's is all grunge and fairy lights, though, Blanca is a white-bricked striking contrast. Twelve leather stools sit around the kitchen, easily as big as the \"restaurant\" itself. The only decoration is the head of a blue marlin on the wall and two slabs of meat: outrageously marbled, wagyu-style beef (it turns up later, simply seared with vincotto and bitter, creamy radicchio Castelfranco, its burgundy interior as rich and intense as blue cheese) and heavily fatted pork. Dolly Parton warbles from a concealed speaker. I already suspect it's love. There are (I think) 24 dishes in all: each a couple of mouthfuls, each gobstopping in its simple complexity. They tell a tale of chef Carlo Mirarchi's Italian background by way of Japan and the veg plot. Many are meat-free: Marcona almond puree, salsify, lovage, satsuma and lemon zest, a pastel palette of shy flavours that add up to a startlingly vivid whole. When the meat kicks in, it kicks like a bruiser. We watch as a duck, head still lolling, is basted and burnished until it shimmers like bronze. It arrives, a couple of fragrant slices and crisp skin, with a chocolatey beetroot dollop, a riff on Mexican mole. That pork has the mouthfilling length of good wine. There are fat, wriggly al dente pici dressed with ripe squab and its innards, as honking as a Roman marketplace; and an insanely pungent raviolo of n'duja. Curiosities, too: meaty littleneck clams served with \"sea grapes\", tiny peppercorns of seaweed that spritz seawater as you bite into them. Or rutabaga \u2013 finally I get to type rutabaga \u2013 with carrots in a limpid vegetal broth with crunch from celtuce (me neither; a kind of lettuce, apparently) and pistachio. It's Blondie's turn to warble now. I'm dazzled and vaguely hysterical \u2013 in a good way. We're thrilled right down to the final fennel pollen marshmallow, the effect a gradual, cumulative and intensely pleasurable sating rather than grande bouffe. I don't adore it all; vegetable-based desserts can now do one, and there's a plankton agnolotto that should go right back to sleeping with the fishes. But that's the breaks with this kind of deal, and there's nothing that hasn't been thought through with wit and intelligence. Accompanying drinks are every bit as exhilarating: rare organic whites from the slopes of Etna, cider from Upstate NY, Slovenian orange wine. Staff are a delicious combination of clued-up geekiness and warmth. Yes, I'm gushing. Yes, it costs a fortune. Yes, it's hard to get into. But it's a life-enhancing experience, attitude-free and dedicated to enjoyment. There's even one of those Japanese loos that blasts warm water at your bum. Thanks, Pete Wells, I owe you one. \u2022 Blanca 261 Moore Street, Brooklyn, New York 11206, 001 646 703 2715.
