A survey commissioned by the Co-operative Insurance Society - one of the country's biggest institutional investors - claims that companies in the FTSE 100 are flouting corporate governance guidelines laid down to ensure the highest standards of boardroom behaviour. The guidelines, enshrined in the combined code put together over ten years by the Cadbury, Greenbury and Hampel committees, say that the majority of members of any board should be independent non-executives. The remuneration committee should be wholly independent. But the CIS report says that nearly a quarter of those directors named as \"senior independent\" on the board are not independent at all and 60% of remuneration committees, which set directors' pay and bonus packages, are not composed entirely of independents. It also adds that at one in six FTSE companies the majority of non-executives are not independent. The CIS, which has \u00a326bn of funds under management, is among the UK's most active shareholders. As part of its social responsibility commitment it votes on every resolution put forward by every company where it is a shareholder. Last year it showed disapproval at boardroom behaviour by abstaining or voting against 476 resolutions - 13% of those put before it. That is 13 times more than the industry average. Among other findings of its new research, published today, is that more than half of FTSE directors - contrary to the guidelines - still have contracts of two or more years. Ten companies still have one man as chairman and chief executive and 11 companies refuse to spell out the targets directors must hit to receive bonuses."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
