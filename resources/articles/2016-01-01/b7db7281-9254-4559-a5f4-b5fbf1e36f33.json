This had Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s team and supporters in uproar but while an injustice, given the chances spurned, City should have already sealed victory. They failed to score at home for the first time in nearly a year, the last occasion being a 2-0 FA Cup defeat to Middlesbrough on 24 January 2015. It meant their domination of Everton ended in the dropping of what may prove crucial points in this wide-open title race. Of the Sterling penalty claim, Pellegrini said: \u201cI don\u2019t think I need to give my thoughts about that action. The whole stadium could see it was a penalty. It was so clear, so near for the referee and both legs of Raheem were taken and it was a clear foul from Stones. But if the referee doesn\u2019t whistle for it, we can\u2019t say anything about that.\u201d Roberto Mart\u00ednez offered a bullish take on the incident, seeming to suggest Sterling was hoping to deceive the referee into awarding the kick. \u201cThe way I saw it live and I haven\u2019t seen the replay, I saw John Stones go to ground to block the trajectory of the ball, the direction of the ball. All of a sudden, Raheem Sterling is quite happy not to play the ball and he wants to invite some sort of a contact. Not long ago we were on the receiving end of a really poor decision right at the end in the last minute against Stoke.\u201d The Everton manager was referring to a Marko Arnautovic penalty in Everton\u2019s 4-3 defeat at Goodison Park. \u201cIt was the wrong decision at that time. What you want as a manager is a referee that is 100% when he gives that sort of decision.\u201d Pellegrini had felt unable to start David Silva, who was a substitute, so he asked Sterling to operate at No10, Jes\u00fas Navas was on the right and the disappointing Kevin De Bruyne on the left. The Sterling-De Bruyne partnership was lively. The England man won the opening corner which was taken by the Belgian, though it came to nothing. Later they combined as De Bruyne sprinted into the area from Sterling\u2019s pass in what was a second warning to the visitors. Everton arrived with only three away victories but on the half-hour Leon Osman suggested they had no fear of the Etihad. Romelu Lukaku chipped a ball in from the right and Osman let go a sweet left-foot volley that went narrowly wide. After creating this chance Lukaku showed why he is the League\u2019s joint top scorer, with 15 goals. Stones sliced City open with a pass along the right and the centre-forward sprinted into the area but as he shot Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi did enough to put off the Belgian. Although neither manager made a substitution at the interval Pellegrini tinkered with his personnel, swapping the positions of De Bruyne and Sterling. If he hoped for a dividend from the latter\u2019s pace down the left he came close to an instant yield. Taking the ball along the corridor Sterling\u2019s speed allowed him to tear towards Tim Howard but the attempt was a disappointment, so off target it came closer to being a throw-in than to giving City the lead. Yaya Tour\u00e9\u2019s form has enjoyed a recent upturn and a buccaneering run and shot that forced a corner again showed the force he can be for City. De Bruyne, who previously scuffed a delivery from the right, this time aimed better as it came at Sergio Ag\u00fcero at speed and the No10\u2019s header needed the excellent Howard to be sharp to repel it. This was now City\u2019s best passage of play. Sterling again might have taken himself into double figures for City this season but he could not convert. Next up, De Bruyne had a cross-cum-shot that came to nothing. After Mart\u00ednez brought on Steven Pienaar and Arouna Kon\u00e9 for Osman and Gerard Deulofeu, Pellegrini made his own move. De Bruyne was replaced by Silva, the manager looking for the player he views as City\u2019s X-factor to fashion a third league victory in four outings. But the player nicknamed \u201cMerlin\u201d could not affect the outcome. City probed but could not find the ruthless edge required. They will hope not to look back with regret at this come the end of the season. Pellegrini had to concede this had been a missed opportunity to close the gap with the leaders. \u201cYes of course. Not because you play at home and you drop points, it\u2019s because we had a lot of merit, especially during the second half, to win this game, in a clear way. But for different reasons we couldn\u2019t score. But we have another 17 games and the important thing is to try to continue in the way we are. \u201cI am happy about the performance, although I am disappointed with the result. But nothing is finished yet.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
