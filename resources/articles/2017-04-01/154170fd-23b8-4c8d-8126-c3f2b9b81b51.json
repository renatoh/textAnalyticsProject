Thousands of people with rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease and other conditions will be retested this year to decide whether they are still eligible for personal independence payments (PIP) because of their disabilities. But MPs and patient charities argue that repeated testing makes little sense for people with incurable diseases that are known to get progressively worse. According to the most recent figures from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP), 3,500 people with progressive conditions were reassessed for PIP between April and October last year. Carol Monaghan, the MP for Glasgow North West, said she was challenging four cases where patients with multiple sclerosis had been called in for reassessment despite their illness getting worse. \u201cMS is a progressive condition. They\u2019re never going to be any better than they are at the moment, so they should never be asked to go for a reassessment,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of these people are still able to walk to a certain extent, so they get themselves in, just about, and then they\u2019re being told, \u2018You look fine,\u2019\u201d she added. The number of people called in for reassessments was obtained by Madeleine Moon, the MP for Bridgend, in a written parliamentary question. The DWP figures reveal that the number of people reassessed for PIP rose sharply from 200 in 2014\u201315 to 2,400 in 2015\u201316. The DWP say the reviews ensure that patients receive benefits in line with their disabilities. \u201cPIP is an interactive benefit, designed to ensure any changes in a claimant\u2019s functional ability can be identified and that they receive the right support at the right time,\u201d a spokesperson said. More than a quarter of claimants are receiving the highest level of support, he added. But Phil Reynolds at Parkinson\u2019s UK said around a quarter of people living with Parkinson\u2019s in Britain had lost some or all of their support following benefit reassessments, only to have the payments reinstated on appeal. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely crucial that the DWP looks again at the broken PIP assessment to ensure people with long-term conditions get the support they so desperately need, rather than rigging the system against them,\u201d he said. Nearly half of people with multiple sclerosis who claim PIP must be reassessed within two years, according to MS Society. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the number of people with MS being inappropriately reassessed, especially when we know assessments can cause stress and anxiety, and in some cases exacerbate MS symptoms,\u201d said Laura Wetherly from MS Society. \u201cWith more than 100,000 people living with MS in the UK, the PIP system needs to accurately reflect the realities of living with a fluctuating and progressive condition. Having a disability like MS is hard enough. People should be able to rely on support without fear of having it taken away,\u201d she added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
