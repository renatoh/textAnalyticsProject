If there\u2019s anything that Slimane\u2019s career has told us, it\u2019s that he is a man who likes to keep his audience guessing, and this event was no different. Prior to the show, he sent attendees a book of seven posters by the American artist David Kramer. With their expressive brushstrokes in a rainbow palette and slogans such as \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get better than this\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m still waiting for my Hollywood ending\u201d the artworks are a world away to Slimane\u2019s signature silent tailoring. The connection was symbiotic. Kramer is famed for referencing the 1970s in his work, while Slimane has a soft spot for a finding a fresh take on nostalgia. As such, the dominant silhouette was flared trousers \u2013 which came in denim and leather \u2013 worn with cropped jackets and Converse-style shoes. Double-breasted blazers, from heritage-check wool to navy and nautical, were given a high-low mix and styled with high-waisted bottoms or slimline dungarees and there was an ode to John Travolta\u2019s Saturday Night Fever wardrobe with a red open-neck shirt worn with a black suit. Styled with rock-star hair and aviators, it all created the classic rock band look that synonymous with the designer. But this was less Camden, more rich-kid California, where the designer spends a lot of his time. Slimane is notoriously private, seldom giving interviews and preferring to let his clothes do the talking. Through this collaboration with Kramer, the collection had a little more to say than usual. T-shirts read \u201cI Am My Own Worst Enemy\u201d while basket bags (destined to be cult items, albeit with an eye-watering price tag) read \u201cI have nostalgia for things I have probably never known\u201d. This, his second menswear collection for the brand, is home turf for Slimane. A celebrated supremo of menswear from his days at Dior Homme, his knack for cutting the perfect suit has never been debated. But while there were no fewer than 21 suits in his first menswear show in January, there were no more than four on Sunday. (By the same token, this show had 15 fewer looks.) While an extended collection of tailoring will still be for sale in the ateliers, Slimane\u2019s choice to focus on a more laidback look suggests he has hit his stride. The reaction to a great fashion show is a reminder of the importance of the live experience over consuming everything digitally. Like a music recital or dance performance \u2013 or, as Slimane would no doubt have it, a gig \u2013 it creates an energy that helps fans to understand where an artist\u2019s head is at. The applause had started before the last model had exited the runway and \u2013 while in the past he has declined a traditional designer bow \u2013 Slimane emerged with a smile and a wave moments later. Celine\u2019s owners LVMH have made no secret of their satisfaction with Slimane in the creative director seat. In April, chief executive Bernard Arnault has called him an outstanding designer who is \u201cwell on his way with women\u2019s and men\u2019s collections [at Celine]\u201d. Two months later, he isn\u2019t disappointing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
