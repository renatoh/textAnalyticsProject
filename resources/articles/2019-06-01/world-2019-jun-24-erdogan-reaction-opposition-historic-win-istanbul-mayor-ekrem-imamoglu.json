Across Istanbul on Sunday night, hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters danced in the streets waving Turkish flags and brandishing glasses of beer and raki after their candidate for mayor delivered the most serious blow to the president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, in his political career. As municipal workers cleaned up on Monday morning, however, the front pages of Turkey\u2019s pro-government newspapers downplayed the unprecedented success of the Republican People\u2019s party (CHP) mayor-elect, Ekrem \u0130mamo\u011flu. \u201cIstanbul has voted,\u201d read the subdued headline of the usually rabidly pro-Erdo\u011fan tabloid Yeni \u015eafak. There were no pictures of the fireworks and scenes of jubilation hours before. While the opposition nurses a collective hangover, attention is turning to what the president\u2019s next move will be. \u0130mamo\u011flu ended 25 years of Islamist party dominance in the rerun for control of Turkey\u2019s biggest city and economic centre, which accounted for 31% of GDP in 2017. The result has serious financial implications for the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) and its patronage networks, and will amplify the sense among the opposition and within Erdo\u011fan\u2019s party that the president\u2019s power is starting to wane. The loss of Istanbul also has repercussions for policymaking in Ankara. The second defeat has ossified divisions within the president\u2019s party and has led to a collapse in public support for his coalition partner, the rightwing Nationalist Movement party (MHP). Erdo\u011fan needs the MHP to command a majority in parliament. A cabinet reshuffle is likely. The former president Abdullah G\u00fcl and the former prime minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu both openly criticised the AKP for seeking a rerun, fuelling rumours in Turkish media that the senior politicians were preparing to form breakaway parties. There is also speculation that Erdo\u011fan may call a snap election to rid his government of fractious elements as he grapples with issues such as Turkey\u2019s struggling economy, Ankara\u2019s next steps in Syria\u2019s war and the prospect of US sanctions over the planned purchase of a Russian S-400 missile system. Nicholas Danforth, a senior visiting fellow at the Washington-based German Marshall Fund thinktank, said: \u201cErdo\u011fan is adept at being conciliatory when necessary and cracking down on dissent when necessary. \u201cTo date, he has maintained power by using both of those methods effectively. Last night\u2019s result is something new, making it hard to tell what the president will do next to reverse the momentum that is building against him.\u201d Many \u0130mamo\u011flu supporters were anxious in the hours between voting closing and the first results on Sunday night that the government was planning to challenge what polls showed was likely to be a decisive second victory. His narrow win in March was annulled by Turkey\u2019s election board after it upheld one of dozens of AKP procedural complaints. However, the AKP candidate, Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, avoided the embarrassment of watching a slow-motion defeat by conceding minutes after the initial results began trickling through, striking a conciliatory tone as he wished \u0130mamo\u011flu luck. The president issued his congratulations to \u0130mamo\u011flu on Twitter shortly afterwards and Turkey\u2019s electoral board ratified the victory by a staggering margin of more than 800,000 ballots \u2013 54% of the vote \u2013 on Monday. Turkey\u2019s borrowing rates eased and the lira rallied to 5.717 against the US dollar, up nearly 2%, as the repeat election ended months of political uncertainty. The decision to rerun the contest, defying the will of voters who had chosen to punish the government for its mishandling of the economic crisis, was an unusual strategic error by the AKP. The mistake was compounded by an erratic and sloppy second campaign in which Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m was forced to play catch up to \u0130mamo\u011flu. The opposition candidate, already popular for his inclusive and anti-populist stance, was able to canvass on a new platform of saving Turkish democracy. As polls in the lead-up to the repeat election showed \u0130mamo\u011flu pulling ahead by 9%, the government resorted to desperate tactics. Erdo\u011fan insinuated the opposition candidate was working with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) and a bizarre statement carried on the official government news agency from the jailed PKK leader Abdullah \u00d6calan called on Istanbul\u2019s approximately 4 million Kurdish voters not to support the secular CHP\u2019s \u0130mamo\u011flu. The measures backfired after Kurdish political parties reiterated their unofficial coalition support for \u0130mamo\u011flu. On Sunday night, the swift and gracious acknowledgement of defeat from the AKP struck yet another tone. Lisel Hintz, a professor at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s European and Eurasian studies department, said: \u201cWe still need to see how Erdo\u011fan reacts to \u0130mamo\u011flu\u2019s victory. Istanbul serves not only as a symbol of where he launched his political career, but also as a massive source of rents that can be used to garner electoral support. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen already through the rerun that he was not willing to let it go easily. We now have to wait and see whether \u0130mamo\u011flu\u2019s tenure as mayor will be interfered with in any way, whether by cutting off funding and hampering his office\u2019s ability to provide services or by removing him under some legal pretext.\u201d Also on Monday, the trial began of 16 prominent figures from the 2013 Gezi Park protests in Istanbul that challenged Erdo\u011fan\u2019s authority \u2013 a reminder that while Istanbul has signalled its overwhelming appetite for change, the president has over the years consolidated his grip on Turkey\u2019s democratic institutions, and remains very much in control. For many, memories of the 2015 general election which ended the AKP\u2019s majority in parliament \u2013 but was reheld in October that year, yielding a more favourable result for the ruling party \u2013 are still fresh. The overarching mood on the city\u2019s \u0130stiklal Avenue and in liberal neighbourhoods was still upbeat, however, as the opposition relished its rare victory. \u201cI want \u0130mamo\u011flu to follow through on the promises he made to the city,\u201d said Aysun Oktay, 18. \u201cI want more sports facilities and opportunities for young people.\u201d \u201cHer \u015fey \u00e7ok g\u00fczel olacak [everything\u2019s going to be alright],\u201d she said, echoing the slogan of \u0130mamo\u011flu\u2019s second campaign. \u201cHe has shown us we can trust him.\u201d Additional reporting by G\u00f6k\u00e7e Sara\u00e7o\u011flu"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
