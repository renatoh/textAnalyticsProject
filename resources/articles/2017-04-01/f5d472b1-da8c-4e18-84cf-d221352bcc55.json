The findings have caused alarm among scientists, who say the proximity of the 2016 and 2017 bleaching events is unprecedented for the reef, and will give damaged coral little chance to recover. Scientists with the Australian Research Council\u2019s Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies last week completed aerial surveys of the world\u2019s largest living structure, scoring bleaching at 800 individual coral reefs across 8,000km. The results show the two consecutive mass bleaching events have affected a 1,500km stretch, leaving only the reef\u2019s southern third unscathed. Where last year\u2019s bleaching was concentrated in the reef\u2019s northern third, the 2017 event spread further south, and was most intense in the middle section of the Great Barrier Reef. This year\u2019s mass bleaching, second in severity only to 2016, has occurred even in the absence of an El Ni\u00f1o event. Mass bleaching \u2013 a phenomenon caused by global warming-induced rises to sea surface temperatures \u2013 has occurred on the reef four times in recorded history. Prof Terry Hughes, who led the surveys, said the length of time coral needed to recover \u2013 about 10 years for fast-growing types \u2013 raised serious concerns about the increasing frequency of mass bleaching events. \u201cThe significance of bleaching this year is that it\u2019s back to back, so there\u2019s been zero time for recovery,\u201d Hughes told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s too early yet to tell what the full death toll will be from this year\u2019s bleaching, but clearly it will extend 500km south of last year\u2019s bleaching.\u201d Last year, in the worst-affected areas to the reef\u2019s north, roughly two-thirds of shallow-water corals were lost. Hughes has warned Australia now faces a closing window to save the reef by taking decisive action on climate change. The 2017 bleaching is likely to be compounded by other stresses on the reef, including the destructive crown-of-thorns starfish and poor water quality. The category-four tropical cyclone Debbie came too late and too far south for its cooling effect to alleviate bleaching. But Hughes said its slow movement across the reef was likely to have caused destruction to coral along a path up to 100km wide. \u201cIt added to the woes of the bleaching. It came too late to stop the bleaching, and it came to the wrong place,\u201d he said. The University of Technology Sydney\u2019s lead reef researcher, marine biologist David Suggett, said that to properly recover, affected reefs needed to be connected to those left untouched by bleaching. He said Hughes\u2019 survey results showed such connectivity was in jeopardy. \u201cIt\u2019s that connection ultimately that will drive the rate and extent of recovery,\u201d Suggett said. \u201cSo if bleaching events are moving around the [Great Barrier Reef] system on an annual basis, it does really undermine any potential resilience through connectivity between neighbouring reefs.\u201d Some reef scientists are now becoming despondent. Water quality expert, Jon Brodie, told the Guardian the reef was now in a \u201cterminal stage\u201d. Brodie has devoted much of his life to improving water quality on the reef, one of a suite of measures used to stop bleaching. He said measures to improve water quality, which were a central tenet of the Australian government\u2019s rescue effort, were failing. \u201cWe\u2019ve given up. It\u2019s been my life managing water quality, we\u2019ve failed,\u201d Brodie said. \u201cEven though we\u2019ve spent a lot of money, we\u2019ve had no success.\u201d Brodie used strong language to describe the threats to the reef in 2017. He said the compounding effect of back-to-back bleaching, Cyclone Debbie, and run-off from nearby catchments should not be understated. \u201cLast year was bad enough, this year is a disaster year,\u201d Brodie said. \u201cThe federal government is doing nothing really, and the current programs, the water quality management is having very limited success. It\u2019s unsuccessful.\u201d Others remain optimistic, out of necessity. Jon Day was a director of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority for 16 years until retiring in 2014. Day, whose expertise lies in protected area planning and management, said the federal government\u2019s approach to protecting the reef was sorely lacking. He said it was taking too relaxed an approach to fishing, run-off and pollution from farming, and the dumping of maintenance dredge spoil. The government was far short of the $8.2bn investment needed to meet water quality targets, he said, and Australia was on track to fail its short-term 2018 water quality targets, let alone achieve more ambitious long-term goals. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be optimistic, I think we have to be,\u201d Day said. \u201cBut every moment we waste, and every dollar we waste, isn\u2019t helping the issue. We\u2019ve been denying it for so long, and now we\u2019re starting to accept it. But we\u2019re spending insufficient amounts addressing the problem.\u201d The Queensland tourism industry raised questions about the reliability of the survey, saying scientists had previously made exaggerated claims about mortality rates and bleaching. \u201cThere is no doubt that we have had a significant bleaching event off Cairns this time around,\u201d said Col McKenzie, of the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators. \u201cThe far north probably did a little bit better, Port Douglas to Townsille has seen some significant bleaching,\u201d he said. \u201cFortunately we haven\u2019t seen much mortality at this time, and fortunately the temperatures have fallen.\u201d McKenzie said more money needed to be invested in water quality measures, and criticised what he saw as a piecemeal and uncoordinated approach to water quality projects up and down the coast.
