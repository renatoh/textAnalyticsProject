We\u2019re used to sporting codes being sexist: used to paltry pay packets for female athletes, used to their bodies being objectified, used to sports administrations being dominated by men. Pointing out egregious examples of the worst of sport\u2019s sexism only sometimes raises an eyebrow. I write about sport and gender a fair bit. Only a couple of weeks ago, I wrote about a broadcaster in Adelaide saying on air that women should never be football commentators because they have \u201cannoying voices\u201d. He said of commentator Kellie Underwood: \u201cHer knowledge, her nous, her skills, her technique of calling and commentating is as good as any man, but I don\u2019t want to hear her calling footy.\u201d These comments passed with barely a mention. Occasionally, though, you hit a nerve. And when that happens, those who don\u2019t want to change \u2013 be they fans or media personalities \u2013 are sure to let you know. The responses are so predictable that I created a bingo card for them. Last Saturday, I published a piece on my blog about comments made by leading media personality and Australian Football League club president, Eddie McGuire. The comments were made on Triple M radio ahead of the \u201cBig Freeze\u201d at the Melbourne Cricket ground, an event where high profile football and media figures ride a sled down an ice slide into a pool of freezing water, all to raise money and awareness for Motor Neurone Disease. McGuire said that sportswriter Caroline Wilson should go into a pool of icy water and never come up. I first heard about McGuire\u2019s comments on a podcast called The Outer Sanctum. While I was surprised I hadn\u2019t heard about it elsewhere, it wasn\u2019t entirely shocking. After all, these sorts of things happen all the time in Australia without much attention. So I wrote a pretty brief piece: I transcribed the comments, uploaded a clip of the audio, and called on the AFL to act. I expected it, too, to pass largely unnoticed. But not so this time. The story started to gain momentum. McGuire\u2019s position as the president of Australia\u2019s most powerful football club, and the high profile of his cohosts undoubtedly ensured the issue got more attention. By Monday, it was front page news in Australia, and the CEO of the AFL called a press conference to discuss the issue. For the AFL, with its audience over 40% female, there was a lot at stake. As the story grew, so too did the backlash, both generally and for me personally. With significant attention and widespread condemnation of the comments comes a more significant chance of change. There is a significant minority who\u2019d rather sport remains as it is: a \u201cblokey\u201d culture dominated by straight, white men. This group can be very vocal about denying there is anything wrong with the status quo, and metaphorically shooting the messenger. But even though the scale was so much bigger than it had ever been before, the responses were depressingly predictable. Even after the issue surfaced, McGuire gave a tepid apology that essentially said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry if people were offended.\u201d It was only after he had conversations both with Wilson herself and with Phil Cleary, a longtime campaigner to prevent violence against women, that McGuire issued another apology, more fully owning his actions. But that wasn\u2019t the end of it. The next evening, the host of the high-rating AFL Footy Show, Sam Newman, criticised both Wilson herself and the football media that covered the story. Addressing the camera as though it was Wilson, he said: \u201cYou\u2019re becoming an embarrassment. And even if you were underwater, you\u2019d still be talking.\u201d The implication was clear: that the only acceptable thing for Wilson to do is shut up. He then went on to criticise those who covered the story, saying, \u201cIf you search for a cause to fit a narrative you are peddling, eventually you will convince yourself you stumbled onto something, as most of the cowardly excrement have, those excrement who have weighed into this. I would like to mention their names [but] as no one reads, watches or listens to them because they\u2019re in second-tier media outlets, I won\u2019t bother.\u201d I can only assume he included me in that comment, as the first person to write about it. Again, Newman uses harsh language to suggest that those who spoke out should not have done so: essentially, that we should shut up. He\u2019s not the only one who thinks so. Over the past week, I\u2019ve received hundreds of emails, Twitter messages and comments on my blog, ranging from supportive to downright abusive. My favourite was the man who emailed me to tell me to get my \u201cover-educated head out of my ass\u201d, then signed it \u201cLove, Brian\u201d. But almost all of the creative types of abuse and negative feedback have the same end goal in mind: to silence people who speak out. Sometimes it\u2019s through gaslighting, suggesting that the reactions of those who are speaking out are disproportionate or just plain wrong. In this case, it was the many incarnations of \u201cwhy can\u2019t you just take a joke\u201d or \u201cstop taking yourself so seriously\u201d. These responses are designed to make those speaking out question the legitimacy of their own reactions. Sometimes, it\u2019s through \u201cplaying the man\u201d and criticising the person who is making the comment, rather than the substance of the comment itself. I have lost track of the number of times I\u2019ve been told by men on the internet this week that I\u2019m only doing it for attention. I asked male journalists if they had ever had this response: few had, and certainly none with the frequency I\u2019ve received it this week. Some have gone as far as to claim they know definitively that my motivation was to raise my profile, which conveniently ignores the years of writing on this topic. I write about sexism \u2013 and diversity more broadly \u2013 in sport because I believe sport is an important part of our culture, and that to be a truly inclusive society, we need that inclusiveness to extend to sport. The only way for that to happen is through attention on the issue, both for fans who might think twice about their words and actions and for those in leadership positions in the game, that they might take actions to improve the culture from the top. I absolutely write so the issue \u2013 not me personally \u2013 gets attention. It\u2019s also a strange criticism to make of a journalist: we all do our jobs to gain attention for the issues we cover, whether that\u2019s the story of the day or insights into bigger issues. The best journalism is the stuff that stays with you, that makes you rethink the way you approach an issue. Suggesting that female journalists are doing something wrong when they are successful in drawing attention to an issue is as incorrect as it is a blatantly sexist attempt to silence us. Others use more obvious diversion tactics, either changing the subject \u2013 \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you talk about this incident from eight years ago\u201d \u2013 or by making false comparisons \u2013 \u201cwhy don\u2019t you care about real gender discrimination, like women suffering in the Middle East\u201d. This attempts to derail to conversation and shift it from the discussion of real incidents of sexism to something else. And then there are those who just resort to abuse: claiming the sexist taunt is totally accurate or making similar, or even more abusive comments themselves. These can be anything from name-calling to threats of violence. When you call out sexism in sport in a way that genuinely draws attention to it, all of these responses are entirely predictable and they are designed to do one thing: to stop us having the conversation, lest we one day actually change something. Despite all the abuse she has received, both in this incident and more broadly, Caroline Wilson hasn\u2019t been silenced. She has spoken up this week about what happened, first in a column for The Age, then appearing on this week\u2019s edition of The Outer Sanctum. Perhaps more importantly, she will be on her beat this weekend, covering the football with fearlessness and insight. And I, and the countless other women who have spoken up about this, won\u2019t be silenced either. We will continue to fight to make football a better, more welcoming place. These are important conversations: sport is one of Australia\u2019s most significant cultural institutions. We need to keep discussing how to make it more inclusive for all: for women, for people of colour, for members of the LGBT community. Sometimes, the blokes afraid of change won\u2019t listen to us at all. Sometimes, they\u2019ll scream from the rooftops trying to drown out our voices."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
