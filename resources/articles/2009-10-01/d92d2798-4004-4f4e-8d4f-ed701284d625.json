The title refers to the 4,000 Italian boys \"sacrificed\" each year to become castrati, performing virtuosic music of coloratura verve and passion. Essentially this tortuous process stopped their voices breaking while their bodies continued to develop (a strange neutering reflected on the CD cover in which Bartoli's head is superimposed on a male nude scuplture) so the Catholic church, not permitted to have female singers, could still have a voluptuous soprano line, and never mind how. The practice flowered especially in the Neapolitan Baroque \u2013 Farinelli was a cult hero \u2013 but limped on into the 20th century. Mainly world premieres, these arias are by names such as Porpora, Graun and the more familiar Caldara. Il Giardino Armonico play like the wind. But Bartoli is the quivering, vibratile star and the turbulent opening, \"Come nave\" (\"Like a ship amid the waves\") leaves you giddy. More reflective numbers, such as Graun's \"Where is my love?\" strike you dumb with their beauty. Altogether an exhilarating if exhausting business, fantastic stuff safest in small quantities. c"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
