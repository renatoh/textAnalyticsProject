The decision, which will raise the pay of most cabinet colleagues from \u00a399,793 to \u00a3117,979 a year and his own from \u00a3116,339 to \u00a3163,418, was announced almost as an afterthought at the end of Mr Blair's ministerial reshuffle. Senior ministers have been grumbling for years that they deserve the \"rate for the job\" and in March the senior salaries review body rebuked the prime minister for \"distorting\" the ministerial pay structure. MPs will receive \u00a349,822 from April 1. But in the wake of an election which saw voter turnout fall to 59% amid accusations of alienation and apathy, last night's move is bound to cause criticism, even though government salaries have fallen rapidly behind those of senior civil servants and the private sector for many years. Downing Street last night sought to put a positive gloss on the decision by stressing that Mr Blair had forgone 41% of the salary he had been entitled to since 1997, and most cabinet ministers 27%. Well over \u00a31m has been saved in the process. The lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, was legally obliged to take his salary, which is still slightly above Mr Blair's. William Hague takes the full \u00a3110,000-plus as leader of the opposition - until he steps down. Other cabinet members in the Lords, who do not get part of an MPs salary in their package, will move from \u00a374,911 to \u00a388,562. Last year Mr Blair bounced his team into accepting a fourth year of pay restraint - rises of only 2.9% - without any debate in cabinet, fully aware that John Prescott had accused him of behaving \"like Jesus Christ\" on the subject. \"You have a wife who earns money, I have one who spends it,\" Mr Prescott was alleged to have told him. On entering office Mr Blair and the chancellor, Gordon Brown, had argued that New Labour should set an example in pay restraint, fearful that the unions would demand big pay rises after the tough Tory years. They also introduced the minimum wage at \u00a33.70 an hour, the equivalent of \u00a39,235.20 a year for a 40-hour week, though families have been given extra help. In the event, unions exercised restraint while directors in the City and elsewhere pursued telephone book salaries, share options and bonuses on a scale not seen in the rest of Europe. The reshuffle saw Peter Hain replace Keith Vaz as Europe minister, despite his openly voiced doubts in the past about key policies, including the euro. No 10 insisted that Mr Vaz, the centre of controversy over his financial dealings, had resigned on grounds of ill-health and not been sacked. It said he was one of four ministers to go voluntarily. About 20 others were sacked and replaced, mainly by \"class of 97\" newcomers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
