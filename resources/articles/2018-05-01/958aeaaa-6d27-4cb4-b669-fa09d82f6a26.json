Correa, who was president of Ecuador between 2007 and 2017, called the Guardian\u2019s \u201cOperation Hotel\u201d story \u201csensationalistic\u201d and said the embassy security measures were \u201croutine and modest\u201d in an interview with the Intercept . \u201cWhen we have special security, we hire private security firms to provide it. There is nothing unusual about this. It would have been a violation of our duties if we did not,\u201d he told the website. Correa, who now lives in his wife\u2019s home country of Belgium, claimed Ecuador\u2019s current government was not allowing the WikiLeaks founder to receive visitors, a move he criticised, describing it as a form of \u201ctorture\u201d and a violation of the country\u2019s duty to protect Assange\u2019s wellbeing and safety. The Guardian contacted Correa by email prior the publication of the Operation Hotel article but received no response. An adviser to the ex-president said he had not been authorised to \u201cforward\u201d Correa\u2019s responses but confirmed the former leader had received the questions. In his interview with the Intercept, Correa said that did not see the email until after the story was published. The adviser confirmed that the Operation Hotel security operation to protect Assange cost around $60,000 monthly, a similar figure to $66,000 calculated by the Guardian in an investigation with Focus Ecuador. Most of Ecuador\u2019s main newspapers and broadcasters have published stories following up the Guardian\u2019s investigation, which prompted intense debate on social media about the public spending on Julian Assange\u2019s extended stay in the country\u2019s London embassy. The government of Correa\u2019s successor, Len\u00edn Moreno, has made no public comment on the article. But the British ambassador in Ecuador, Katherine Ward, told local journalists that Assange had broken the law and was \u201cmore or less a fugitive from justice\u201d. Speaking at a public forum at a university in Quito, she added Assange prevented the UK from \u201chonouring an extradition request from Sweden\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s accumulated indignation about the Assange case,\u201d said Jorge Ortiz, an analyst of international affairs in Quito. \u201cSix years have passed and the people don\u2019t understand why the government has given refuge to Mr Assange,\u201d he said. \u201cCorrea handled public funds as if they were his to do with as he pleased. There should be an investigation into these completely unjustified costs.\u201d Last month, prosecutors in Quito opened an investigation into Correa and 10 former officials for alleged mismanagement of public debt during the last five years of his government."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
