By the weekend it was plain that the director general was out of his depth in trying to manage the crisis gripping the BBC. As editor-in-chief, he was ultimately responsible for a catastrophic editorial misjudgment over Lord McAlpine \u2013 probably worse than the original Newsnight decision over its Jimmy Savile investigation, now the subject of its own drawn-out inquiry. He failed to respond to blinding warning lights before or after transmission. Breathtakingly, he was not even alerted to a front-page story in Friday's Guardian spelling out the problems in black and white. No editor-in-chief can be as out of touch as that and survive. So, honourably enough, he quit. Such a high-profile resignation can sometimes lance the boil and allow for a clean start. That \u2013 amid a welter of inquiries, recriminations and legal cases \u2013 is not possible. The first and most urgent problem facing the acting director general, Tim Davie, and the chair, Lord Patten, is how to stabilise the rudderless ship of BBC journalism while the BBC Trust searches for a successor. The normal chain of command was suspended pending the Savile incriminations and inquiries, with Patten hinting that he expects a cleaning-out of the executive block of the Augean stables \u2013 whether or not merited. But the alternative chain of reporting lines and supervision failed spectacularly on the McAlpine story. Patten is not an executive and Davie is not a journalist. So who is, for the moment, in charge of the clattering train? Next, the temporary team must decide what to do about Newsnight. It has, for more than 30 years, been the most thoughtful and reliable current affairs show on British television. In recent years it has sometimes struggled with pared-back resources and with its tone of voice. It is not clear that it is suited to doing the kind of ambitious and aggressive investigative journalism that has recently proved so troubling. That's not to say it shouldn't attempt tenacious and challenging journalism; it should \u2013 providing it has enough money, people, legal advice and editorial oversight. Under its most recent editor, Peter Rippon, it was plainly a divided and unhappy ship. But it would be both wrong to close it and wrong to rush to reform it \u2013 particularly while editorial heads are so distracted. So why not take it off air for the rest of 2012 and bring it back in the new year, revived and refreshed? Then the BBC Trust \u2013 which is notably short of people with editorial experience \u2013 must quickly find someone up to the job of running a vast media company with 23,000 employees in the middle of brutal technological change while at the same time being \"editor\", in a meaningful sense, of the 40 hours of output generated each and every hour of the day. The director general, in short, needs to be both a chief executive and an editor-in-chief. It is sound, battle-hardened editorial judgment that counts for most: the editorial imperative must always have primacy over the operational. The DG of the BBC must be tough, wise, experienced and brave. Such qualities count more than immersion in corporate management systems. Finally, there needs to be a sense of proportion. Yes, this is a genuine crisis for the BBC. It is difficult to excuse some of its recent mistakes of journalism and management. But it is still a trusted, reliable and internationally respected organisation which will survive and, under the right leadership, thrive. Some of the fury and derision is merited; much isn't. It will be interesting, when Lord Justice Leveson reports in a matter of weeks, to see how many currently outraged Fleet Street executives behave with the dignity and acceptance shown by George Entwistle. And it would be plain wrong if the editorial failures of a single BBC programme were allowed either to distort the bigger picture about the glories of public service broadcasting or to distract attention from where this started \u2013 one of the worst cases of child abuse ever uncovered in Britain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
