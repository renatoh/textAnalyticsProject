Unless I knew them, I wouldn\u2019t ask, so all of the shirts I have now are players that I know.\u201d As a result Aarons, who joined the League One high flyers Wycombe Wanderers on loan in September after being left out of Newcastle\u2019s 25-man Premier League squad, has only a handful of swapped shirts: jerseys worn by Bobby Reid, who also grew up in Easton, in inner-city Bristol, Yannick Bolasie, his former teammates Ivan Toney and Adam Armstrong, and Raheem Sterling, who was also born in Kingston and acts as a source of inspiration. \u201cHe is like superman right now,\u201d Aarons says. \u201cHe\u2019s matured and found his mojo. I\u2019ve spoken to him about that [his form]. He said he\u2019s learnt to ignore everyone else and focus on himself and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to do. He is a massive, massive sort of role model to every kid like me. Raheem has been there and done it. Even though he is only a year older than me, which is crazy; it seems like he has been around for at least 10 years.\u201d Aarons is courteous and compelling company in modest surroundings at Wycombe\u2019s training ground, a world away from the bells and whistles of the Premier League. He acknowledges his career has not gone as projected but he is relaxed, happy to be playing and confident he can get back to the top flight. He uses Wyscout, the analysis platform, to glean bits and pieces from Sterling, as well as perfecting his own game. \u201cI watch Raheem, Douglas Costa, [Kylian] Mbapp\u00e9 \u2013 I watch loads of players that play wide and score goals. I\u2019ll watch clips at home or after training and I\u2019ve got a match analyst that sends me my clips and shows me what I need to do. I might draw a clip in from Cristiano Ronaldo and put it in and be like: \u2018This is what I need to do.\u2019 I love football so I have to watch it, try and learn and master the trade.\u201d As a five-year-old Aarons moved from Jamaica to England, and he spent three years at Bristol City before being released at 16. Trials at Arsenal, West Ham, Crystal Palace and Birmingham followed before Leeds offered him a professional contract. But then Newcastle came calling and Aarons signed on the dotted line after an hour of training. Everything happened pretty quickly, perhaps too quickly. Initially, he says, the move was a culture shock. He was living alone at 18 when he made his debut and first met his cousin Max, the Norwich defender. Aarons smiles but his words are genuine, and telling. \u201cI wish I had me now when I was his age,\u201d he says. \u201cI try to make sure he doesn\u2019t make the same misjudgments or errors that I made when I was that age \u2013 your personal life, making sure you are living right. \u201cEverything was trial and error and, at that age, I don\u2019t feel like you can afford to make those mistakes. You are a little blinded by [the lights]. I grew up really, really poor and overnight everyone loves you and you have a bit more money, you have freedom and, if you don\u2019t know how to handle it, it can make or break you. Luckily, it didn\u2019t break me that bad. It was difficult to deal with that limelight. I\u2019m thankful I came through that.\u201d Aarons turns 24 next week and although there have been bumps in the road since his debut, notably being charged with affray for his part in a bar brawl and rupturing an anterior cruciate ligament, the winger is focused on the bigger picture, acutely aware of how things can change overnight. \u201cI played against Daniel James in my first start for Sheffield Wednesday [on loan against Swansea] and now he\u2019s at Manchester United. It would have been difficult to try and guess that that would have happened at that time.\u201d Aarons recognises his arrest in Newcastle three years ago did not help his image and says there is an unfair perception of him. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that clubs have said \u2018no\u2019 [to signing me] because they have heard this and that. Because of those reasons, I had to go on loan to other places to try and get games and do what I needed to do. It\u2019s been a tough-ish 18 months or two years since my first loan but I have learnt a lot. It\u2019s weird because I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done anything that deserves the reputation or words people say about me but the only way I can correct it is by playing well and scoring goals.\u201d He is doing just that at Wycombe, for whom Aarons has scored in each of his past two games. The switch to Adams Park, where he will stay until at least January, represented another courageous step after Serie A loans with Hellas Verona, where he was reunited with Fabio Pecchia, first-team coach at Newcastle under Rafael Ben\u00edtez, playing against Juventus and against Internazionale and Milan at San Siro, and then Slovan Liberec. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to take a risk,\u201d he says. \u201cI could think: \u2018Do you know what, I can\u2019t be bothered with this, I\u2019ll stay with the under-23s, just chill and earn money.\u2019 But that\u2019s not the sort of person I am. I\u2019m not in this for money; I want to actually be a top player. In the long term I want to be a Premier League player and if that happens at Newcastle that would be perfect for me because I\u2019ve come through there. It\u2019s a great club, I love the club and the fans are great there.\u201d As for Ben\u00edtez, Aarons says the Spaniard was \u201cvery hard to read\u201d but he accepts responsibility for his ups and downs on Tyneside, though being left out of Steve Bruce\u2019s squad hurt, having spent the second half of last season at Wednesday. \u201cI was massively surprised and disappointed, because the week before I had started the preseason game and I had played every game in the summer so the minimum I thought was I was going to be in the squad. It was a tough time and frustrating but the gaffer here [Gareth Ainsworth] rang my agent. My agent told me to speak to him [Ainsworth] and hear him out. I need to do well here \u2013 it\u2019s a massive loan. Hopefully when it gets to January I\u2019ll look back at this loan and be very, very happy about it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
