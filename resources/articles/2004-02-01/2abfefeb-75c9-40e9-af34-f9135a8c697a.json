Someone at the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, the world's leading provider of graded music exams, had heard her winning piece for solo piano, Les Pavots, broadcast on BBC Radio 3 and been very impressed. The board wanted her to join 15 distinguished composers in writing a piece for cello and piano, a compilation called Spectrum, for student, amateur and professional cellists. And so The Stonebreaker by Alissa Firsova has been published along with pieces by such big names as Gavin Bryars, Sally Beamish and Steve Martland. \"Winning the competition opened up so many opportunities,\" says Alissa, who is in her last year at the Purcell school, one of four specialist music schools in England. \"It totally changed my view of music.\" Until then her ambition was to become a pianist. \"I think that competition piece was only the second I'd written,\" she says. \"I began to understand that to become a musician you don't only need the performing side ... It's about creating something of your own. Now I can never even think of having a musical career without having my own music to perform.\" Since winning our competition, she says she has \"written loads\". She won an internal school composition prize for her first piece for orchestra, and then won a scholarship to study with the composer David Bedford at last summer's Dartington international music festival in Devon. There she wrote a clarinet quintet which was performed by Endymion last Saturday at the Purcell Room on London's South Bank. Today we announce another opportunity for budding young composers to enjoy similar success, as we launch the sixth Guardian/BBC Proms young composers competition. If you are aged between 11 and 18 and like creating music, no matter what style - classic, pop, jazz, or any combination - this is your chance to have your piece heard, enjoyed and assessed by some of the most respected names in music. There are two categories, junior (12-16 years) and senior (16-18 years), with up to three winners in each. Junior winners will each receive a Roland EM-15 creative keyboard and a BR-532 digital studio for their schools. Winners in the senior category will receive a Sibelius 2 software package. The winners will hear their pieces at a concert given by Endymion, an ensemble renowned for performance of new music, at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London, on August 2 and will be performed on BBC Radio 3. All winners and runners-up will be invited to attend a day at the Royal Albert Hall on July 23 to take part in workshops with leading composers and attend that evening's concert. Everyone who enters will be invited to attend our forum for young composers on August 2. This gives you the chance to meet people of your own age who share your interest and passion. As well as inspiring talks and workshops, all entrants can attend our version of Question Time. A panel of composers writing music for film and TV, the concert hall and the charts will be grilled about their working lives, how they got started, what's the best way to get commissions and performances, and more. The day ends with a prom in the Royal Albert Hall. PK I like to think of new music coming from a garden of creativity. It's a wonderful place that sustains all forms of musical life and where, with careful nurturing, a small shoot of inspiration can develop into a powerful tree. Maybe this is rather a poetic description of what our young composers do. But this nurturing is perhaps something the musical community doesn't encourage sufficiently in the UK. What is great about the Guardian/BBC Proms competition is that it gives young people a chance to transform from amateur music mechanic to fully-fledged sound designer. Composers and performers depend on one another. Composers can be the reason that performers develop in the world of music, and vice versa. Where might I be in my own musical journey if the James MacMillans, Christopher Rouses, Thea Musgraves and Ned Rorems of this world had not found the determination as young composers to protect themselves from the lonely elements of doubt and criticism? By the same token, where might composers be if their appetites for communicating with audiences were not stimulated by the visionary performing musician? I can see this from both sides. I'm a performer, and I have also found satisfaction through composition. We composers need support and cultivation; like all those great landscape gardeners we have moments of inspiration and moments of frustration. Do we go for the grand design or the humble cottage garden? And what about our patrons and audiences? What do they desire this season? Composition is a long and exhausting business. Like planning and sowing in the winter, you hear the sounds in your head that will eventually come out beautifully. But will you finally sit back in August when it is all done and admire your creation? Will you relish your musical harvest, or criticise the quality of the crop? Young musicians have so much to give to the music community and the community as a whole, but they need good conditions to cultivate their seed. I look forward this year to sampling the new talent of 21st-century composition and supporting and nurturing that gift, by offering advice from my own experiences of this rewarding field, and by helping to outline areas where I feel home-grown talent lies.
