I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this morning. Boris Johnson may have been missing from last night\u2019s Conservative leadership television debate, but he still managed to dominate proceedings as his five rivals took their chance to attack the frontrunner. Jeremy Hunt said the former foreign secretary could not be relied on to negotiate with Brussels if he wasn\u2019t even prepared to face cross-examination on TV, while Rory Stewart had a dig by saying of the candidates in the studio: \u201cI hope it\u2019s one of us who becomes prime minister.\u201d Ahead of the next round of voting tomorrow, the five men laid out their case for winning the leadership with much focus on how they would repair Britain\u2019s Brexit divisions. But Johnson was boosted after he won the backing of one-time leadership rival, Matt Hancock, on Sunday night. Hunt and Stewart were seen by our political correspondent as having had the best of the debate, but sketch writer John Crace reckons that the empty lectern left for Johnson was the night\u2019s winner. But whoever wins, reckons columnist John Harris, they will inevitably fail unless they first try to fix our broken democracy. * * * Hong Kong tensions \u2013 Hong Kong\u2019s political crisis has entered its second week, with demonstrators demanding that the city\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, stand down over her handling of proposed new extradition laws. An estimated two million people flooded the centre of the city on Sunday in what is believed to be the biggest protest in Hong Kong\u2019s history. Protesters want a full public apology from Lam for her attempt to force through laws allowing people to be deported to China for trial. But many experts see the anti-extradition protests as morphing into a wider challenge to Lam\u2019s pro-Beijing government. Joshua Wong, the prominent activist leader who was released from prison today, stepped up pressure on Lam by calling for her to quit. * * * Wrong path \u2013 Painted cycle lanes are a waste of money and do nothing to make cyclists feel safer on the roads, according to Britain\u2019s cycling and walking commissioners. They say the government has wasted millions of pounds on the schemes and have failed to change people\u2019s travel habits. The commissioners, who include the Olympic champions Chris Boardman and Dame Sarah Storey, are meeting in Manchester today for their first summit and call for an end to car-centric transport planning as well as European-style zebra crossings on side roads to indicate pedestrian priority over cars. * * * Myanmar threat \u2013 The United Nations has threatened to withdraw aid from \u201cclosed\u201d refugee camps in Myanmar\u2019s troubled Rakhine state to avoid complicity in a government \u201cpolicy of apartheid\u201d towards Rohingya Muslims. A letter seen by the Guardian sent from UN resident coordinator Knut Ostby to the country\u2019s rulers relayed a decision by the world body and its humanitarian partners to withhold support \u201cbeyond life-saving assistance\u201d in certain camps, unless changes occur. * * * Heathrow warning \u2013 Psychologists say residents in west London could have their mental health damaged by an increase in the number of planes flying over the area if Heathrow airport is allowed to expand with a third runway. The airport\u2019s owners will tomorrow publish a consultation on its expansion plans, including environmental aspects of building a third runway. It could see between 17 and 47 extra flights over scenic Richmond Park. But a doctor who treats patients experiencing stress and anxiety by recommending a trip to the park says the plans will be detrimental to her patients\u2019 mental health. * * * Heights of controversy \u2013 For someone who made his money in property, Donald Trump will no doubt be delighted that his name has been given to some of the most contentious real estate in the world. In honour of his recognition of Israel\u2019s claim to the Golan Heights on the country\u2019s border with Syria, one of the settlements that sprung up in the area after thousands of Syrians were displaced in 1967 has been named Trump Heights. One resident, Naomi Ish Shalom, hopes the US president will visit soon. \u201cI think it will mean something for him, that there is a place in the world, far away from the States, with his name,\u201d she said.

Lunchtime read: Peter Andre embarks on life\u2019s third act For someone widely seen as a here-today, gone-tomorrow pop star, Peter Andre has had a varied career and is now following his early incarnation as a pop-star-turned-reality-TV star with another as an actor in a production of Grease about to tour the UK. But it hasn\u2019t been an easy path for the 46-year-old, who has endured a breakdown and depression along the way. Andre\u2019s mental strife was severe enough to take him out of the public eye for six years (\u201cI remember praying to God: help me get through the day\u201d) after scoring two No 1 hits in the 90s, before he reappeared on I\u2019m a Celebrity and married co-contestant Katie Price. Now remarried, Andre is philosophical about his dark times and opens up to Simon Hattenstone about why would-be reality TV contestants should have mental health checks and how, as a young boy, he narrowly missed encountering Michael Jackson.
