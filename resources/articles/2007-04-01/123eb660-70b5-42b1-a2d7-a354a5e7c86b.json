A sharp rise in ABN Amro's share price yesterday following a counter approach by three banks led by Royal Bank of Scotland, saw banking analysts predicting that Barclays may struggle to match any price the consortium puts on the table. Analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort described the approach by RBS, Santander of Spain and Fortis of Belgium as \"close to perfect ... We believe they could offer up to \u20ac38 per share\". \"We see this as an almost unbeatable combo,\" they added, giving the consortium a 70% chance of winning. At Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods, analysts estimated that the consortium could offer \u20ac39.5 per share, well above the \u20ac34 that has been suggested as the price being considered by Barclays. ABN Amro's shares ended the day 5% higher at \u20ac35.5. Bank shares rose sharply yesterday amid speculation that the fallout of the ABN situation would spark a wave of takeovers. Barclays rose 12.5p to 756p while RBS was at one stage the day's strongest gainer. It ended at \u00a320.71, up 48p. RBS has recently faced criticism for doing too many deals and will be keen for its shareholders' support if it goes ahead and tables a three-way bid for ABN Amro. It is hoping to avoid a cashcall by using existing reserves and its own shares to pay for the part of ABN Amro it wants: LaSalle in the US and the London-based wholesale bank. Any three-way bid is likely to be intricately structured and a factor in ABN Amro management being put off opening its books to the consortium, which has set a deadline for today for a response to its demands to gain access to data that Barclays has already seen. Analysts at KBW suggested any three-way bid could be composed of 7% cash, 28% Santander shares, 35% Fortis shares and 30% shares in Royal Bank of Scotland. The Dutch bank also helped boost its share price by bringing forward a trading statement that showed it was on track to beat its profit targets for 2007. Net profits rose by 31% year-on-year to \u20ac1.31bn (\u00a3892m) in the first three months of 2007. Earnings per share rose 30% to \u20ac0.65, from \u20ac0.50. But evidence that Barclays and ABN Amro were keen to press on was apparent when the Financial Services Authority, which needs to approve the deal, revealed it has received detailed information from the two banks. \"The FSA (and the Dutch central bank) have recently received the further information they requested from ABN Amro and Barclays concerning the legal and management structure of the proposed ... entity,\" the FSA said. John Varley, Barclays chief executive, is expected to hold the same position in the merged group, while ABN Amro chairman Arthur Martinez could chair it"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
