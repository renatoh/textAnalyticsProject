ABC reported that Christie was interrogated last month at the governor\u2019s mansion in Princeton for hours as part of the \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal. Those familiar with the meeting told ABC the investigation appears to be \u201cwrapping up\u201d. Christie\u2019s meeting with prosecutors took months to arrange, according to ABC News, and prosecutors reportedly considered issuing a subpoena for Christie to testify before the grand jury. The George Washington bridge, between New York and New Jersey, is one of the world\u2019s busiest. When two of three lanes were closed in September 2013, the town was thrown in chaos by the volume of traffic trying to enter the bridge. Some alleged that the closures were a retaliation against the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, who refused to endorse Christie during his most recent campaign. Some of Christie\u2019s most senior staffers were fired as a result of investigations into the closures. One of the most infamous emails released during a state legislative inquiry was from Christie\u2019s former deputy chief of staff Bridget Anne Kelly, who before the closures wrote that it was \u201ctime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\u201d In December, a New Jersey legislative committee concluded that there was no evidence that Christie knew about lane closings on the bridge. The Christie administration is also being investigated for funnelling money from the Port Authority, a bi-state agency, to repair the Pulaski Skyway, a bridge that is owned by the state."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
