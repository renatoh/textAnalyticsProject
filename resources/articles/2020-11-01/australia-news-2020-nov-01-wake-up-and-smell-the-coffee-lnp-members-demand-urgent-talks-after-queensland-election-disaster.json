As counting continues in a number of close seats, the LNP\u2019s numbers are likely to go backwards in the next parliament. In her concession speech on election night, Deb Frecklington said she intended to remain as the state leader. The coronavirus pandemic has been a defining issue of the campaign but party figures, including the former premier Campbell Newman, say the result also points to longstanding problems. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the LNP to wake up and smell the coffee,\u201d Newman told Sky News. \u201cThe polling throughout the three years showed an LNP primary vote bouncing around between 35% and 37%. I happen to know that a track poll in June this campaign on those marginal seats \u2026 at one stage the primary vote was down at 32%. \u201cIt\u2019s not about Covid-19. Yes, that\u2019s obviously been very difficult for them. But that is going the be the excuse that they present to people, but that is self-delusional. It\u2019s time to realise that they\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d The LNP\u2019s election preparations were remarkable in that four months before polling day \u2013 based on the tracking poll Newman referred to \u2013 party backroom figures attempted to replace Frecklington as leader. Of greatest concern then was that polling showed she had failed to cut through against the popular premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk. Among the membership there is considerable anger directed towards certain party powerbrokers, including some with links to the mining magnate, Clive Palmer, who ran an expensive but ineffective anti-Labor spoiler campaign. Palmer\u2019s United Australia party spent more than $4m on advertising attacking Labor and won 0.6% of the statewide vote. Frecklington had previously relied heavily the backing of those powerbrokers. But since the attempted leadership coup, that relationship between the leader\u2019s office and party head office has become strained. Sources say the disconnect hampered the campaign. The party also referred concerns about a series of private election fundraising events featuring Frecklington and attended by property developers \u2013 who are banned from making donations \u2013 to the electoral commission. Another factor causing concern is the increased factionalism within the merged party, and claims that candidate selection for the Queensland election was largely based on ideological preselection battles rather than electoral common sense. Some candidate choices appear to have backfired. The seat of Maiwar \u2013 a previously marginal electorate held by the Greens \u2013 had previously been identified as a key target of the LNP campaign. The LNP\u2019s candidate there, the former journalist Lauren Day, was backed by the Christian right and endorsed by anti-abortion campaigners. On election day LNP volunteers were spotted putting up anti-abortion signs. The Greens won the seat with a large swing. It is now considered safe. \u201cIf we can\u2019t pick a moderate to run in Brisbane\u2019s western suburbs, of all places, then it\u2019s hard to see where actual pro-business, progressive Liberals fit in with the modern party,\u201d one member said. \u201cThe Greens don\u2019t lose seats when they win them. That is heartland area we might never win back.\u201d The LNP only holds four seats in Brisbane \u2013 a position considered a low ebb for the party. Yet across the city, seats swung to Labor, solidifying the margins of sitting MPs. The situation has caused increasing frustration among moderates, who say the merged Liberal and National parties are being heavily influenced by the Christian right and regional interests. The LNP also struggled to cut through in regional areas, including target seats where its primary vote did not get above 30%. One of the stories of the election was the collapse of the One Nation vote, which went backwards by 6.8% after a low-visibility campaign by its figurehead, Senator Pauline Hanson. A low primary vote for the LNP in 2017 was blamed on a surge for One Nation. But deserting One Nation voters did not appear to return to the LNP. The conservative parties \u2013 as separate entities and then after the 2008 merger \u2013 have lost 11 of the past 12 Queensland elections. Some party members suggest the situation shows that the merger of the Liberal and National parties is \u201ca failed marriage\u201d that detracts from its messages at both ends of Queensland, and that a demerger should be discussed. The University of Queensland political historian Chris Salisbury told Guardian Australia he expected demerger debate to follow an election loss. \u201cIf [the LNP] lose this, there\u2019s a good chance there will be a push to split,\u201d Salisbury said last week. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t been talked about as much this time, but it\u2019s the case more so now than ever before.\u201d Some members who support a demerger in principle are also concerned that the process would \u201cleave two carcasses for the buzzards\u201d and that a better option may be a \u201cstability pact\u201d arrangement that would carve up the state among factional interests. It remains unclear whether Frecklington will be able to remain as party leader. The Gold Coast MP David Crisafulli is considered the most likely challenger. \u201cThere\u2019s no one currently in this team who seems to be capable of winning an election,\u201d Newman told Sky. \u201cThis is not the fault of the LNP\u2019s secretariat. This sits at the door of the parliamentary team and the leadership team and the staff of the leader.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
