Staff and patients love to feed them; but managers want to send them into permanent exile. Feathers have been ruffled. Local papers report allegations by anonymous doctors and nurses that their jobs are at risk if they continue to feed the little ones; Halton hospital says that is nonsense. The only certainty is that managers want to rehouse the ducks with the help of a bird protection group. Ducks turned up about a year ago and settled into the hospital's courtyards where they have relied on generous food parcels. Staff say the mass waddling has proved therapeutic for patients. But managers fear the food will attract other birds which may bring with them infection and threats to hygiene. \"We have been told that under no circumstances should members of hospital staff feed or provide water for these ducks,\" an anonymous health worker told the Runcorn Weekly News. \"If we do feed them then the bosses have said that we would be 'severely disciplined' and could lose our jobs.\" Oh no they won't, says a statement from North Cheshire hospitals NHS Trust. \"The trust categorically denies that any members of staff were threatened with disciplinary action or dismissal regarding the ducks at the hospital,\" it said. The trust accepts that patients and staff enjoy seeing the duck families but added: \"As wild birds, they should be left to forage for food themselves. Staff putting out food will also encourage other species of birds to enter the courtyards, which would create issues over hospital cleanliness and infection control.\" Consultations over shifting the lot \"to a more suitable habitat in Runcorn\" are in progress."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
