Discharged from the force after being raped on a stakeout, tough-nut cop Kaja (Marta Nieradkiewicz) is lured back to the coast by the Central Bureau of Investigation to help bring down drug baron Kawecki (Andrzej Seweryn). The silver-fox plutocrat has mastered the art of hiding in plain sight: the well-to-do head of the Solid Gold bank, he launders his money through a posh restaurant and butters up Warsaw politicians for favours. Director Jacek Bromski manages the curious combination of being both too impatient to push his case and too slow to make us care. The initial sexual assault, a series of attention-drawing murders, Kawecki\u2019s dealers later bringing their takings directly to the bank \u2013 either Gydnia\u2019s criminal class are completely foolhardy, or the plausibility police need to have a closer look at Bromski\u2019s script. At the same time, he seems only half-interested in Kaja, who starts out loaded with Lisbeth Salander attitude, kickboxing a wine-bar creep to the ground, until the story meanders away from her. Bromski\u2019s preoccupations belatedly turn out to be more wintry. Only generating intermittent heat from the investigation itself, his focus shifts to whether \u2013 given the political interests on whose toes it treads \u2013 the investigation will take place at all. Here, Kaja\u2019s seasoned boss Nowicki (played with crinkled, phlegmatic reserve by Kieslowski regular Janusz Gajos) takes the reins. He indicts Kawecki\u2019s \u201cdictatorial\u201d lust for power, but admits to Kaja that, in his eagerness to nail the businessman, he has become a dictator himself. There is tragedian\u2019s meat here \u2013 but Bromski never fully carves it up. \u2022 Solid Gold is released in the UK on 6 December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
