Maybe it\u2019s double now,\u201d he guesses, \u201cOnly a few people have that money now.\u201d In the wake of the medevac legislation \u2013 allowing for those detained on Manus Island and Nauru to be transferred to Australia for medical treatment \u2013 the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has claimed the new measures will propel a fresh wave of asylum seeker boats on to Australian shores. But in Indonesia, where more than 13,000 asylum seekers and refugees live in financial hardship and uncertainty, most say they couldn\u2019t get on a boat \u2013 even if they wanted to. For many, mustering up the thousands of dollars that would cost, is near impossible. \u201cThe Australian prime minister, I am so sorry to, say is always telling lies about refugees and our situation,\u201d 21-year-old Erfan Dana, a refugee from Afghanistan, says. \u201cIf I had another option I would not have spent three years of my life in a detention centre,\u201d he continues, \u201cIf I had enough money, I would not choose to be watched 24 hours a day, not going outside with a free mind, and a brave heart, like an ordinary person.\u201d Dana arrived in Indonesia aged 16, and now lives in housing provided by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) in Batam, where he shares a room with three others. Each IOM registered refugee, he says, is in an extreme financial situation, receiving an allowance of Rp1,250,000 (about AUD $123) per month, or less than $4 a day. Thousands of refugees are living that way, in protracted limbo, waiting out a brutally long resettlement process. Most refugees have been here for at least a few years, some a decade, others even longer. Last week an Afghan father and son who have been stuck in Indonesia for 17 years set themselves on fire in their detention centre in Sulawesi, in attempt to get the attention of the UNHCR, after a month-long hunger strike failed. Sajjad, the son, died in hospital three days later. \u201cThey were tired of waiting too long, and suffering from an uncertain future,\u201d says Dana, who can recall at least six other refugee suicides in recent years, \u201cIt was heart breaking for everyone.\u201d One Yemeni refugee, who goes by his nickname \u201cChucky\u201d, is being helped by his family, but that might not last forever. \u201cMy family is supporting me for now, but I don\u2019t know how long that will last,\u201d the 25-year-old told the Guardian, \u201cIf they allowed us to work in Indonesia it would be easier for us to survive, instead of risking our lives on boats.\u201d Prohibited from working in Indonesia \u2013 a country most envisioned would be a brief transit stop \u2013 economic struggles are constant for the thousands of asylum seekers and refugees stranded here from countries such as Afghanistan, Yemen, and Iran. Last year it got so bad that hundreds started sleeping under makeshift tarpaulin tents on a street in West Jakarta, in the hope the adjacent detention facility, already full to the brim, would offer them shelter and food. Some refugees do work illegally, such as setting up stalls in traditional markets, but Badavi says they only make enough to get by: \u201cjust enough for life, and for food.\u201d While Morrison has perpetuated fear-mongering claims the asylum seeker \u201cbeast\u201d could be once again stirring, in Indonesia it is totally different story. Not one of the six refugees interviewed for this story said they knew anyone willing to get on a boat. Besides the financial infeasibility for most, few are willing to put their life in the hands of a people smuggler. Mozhgan Moarefizadeh, an Iranian refugee and co-founder of the Refugees &amp; Asylum Seekers Information Centre, says hardly anyone sees taking a boat as a viable option anymore. \u201cAny time the boat talks come back to the community everyone is just sick of it. They are like no, it just not an option anymore,\u201d Moarefizadeh says, \u201cFirst off it is very risky. They arrive and either they will be turned back or be stuck on Manus, or Nauru or Christmas Island. So what\u2019s the point?\u201d More to the point, she says, many who are already registered as refugees by the UNHCR aren\u2019t willing to try, knowing they will likely get caught and then have to start the lengthy resettlement process all over again. The belief is that after many years in Indonesia already, it is probably faster, and safer, to take the legal route. And even if people smugglers are waiting eagerly in the wings, there are significant doubts traffickers could find thousands willing to get on board. \u201cI hope no one can go by boat,\u201d Badavi says, reflecting on his own perilous attempt several years ago, \u201cBecause then a lot of people will die again.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
