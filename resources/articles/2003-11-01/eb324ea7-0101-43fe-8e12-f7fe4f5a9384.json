From the aeroplane, high above this southern state, on the last leg of a journey from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, via New Delhi and Bombay, I could already see a stark contrast with India's teeming cities and dusty tourist roads. Fed by craggy, forested peaks to the East, Kerala's lowlands ooze fertility. Criss-crossed with swathes of farmed fields, the 50-mile wide, dead-flat strip of land bordering the Arabian Sea is otherwise thick with keras, the graceful coconut palms which give the state its name. At street level, my first impressions of Kochi, Kerala's second city, were of ease, even affluence. The roads are good - some drivers even practise lane discipline - and clean, and most homes are made of bricks and mortar, a far cry from the thousands of shanties which skulk at the edges and in the cracks of communities further north. Here, Sixties bungalows nestle up to acid-coloured villas and the odd plantation-style house. All interspersed with riotous tropical flora, they give parts of town the look of West Hollywood reclaimed by the jungle. Well-fed souls peopled the streets, and, back-lit by intense afternoon sun, crocodiles of cute school-uni formed children wove beneath centuries-old 'sleeping trees' that trailed creepers onto cobbled streets. Natural riches - rice, fish, timber, tea, coffee and spices - have played their part in this prosperity. Keralan life has also been moulded by a spicy political history. Despite some racy ancient customs - polyandry was practised by women in the Dravidian society of the eighteenth century, and their sisters the Nair warrior caste replaced male lovers simply by discarding their slippers - more recent times saw the end of one of India's most oppressive interpretations of the caste system. Its emphatic rejection in the first half of the twentieth century ushered in radical social and land reforms, and early state leaders, including in 1957 the world's first freely-elected Communist government, ordered high public spending on health and education. The World Bank's World Development Report for 2004 found Kerala's standards of literacy and health care way ahead of the rest of India. School enrolment here is 100 per cent and, most remarkably in a country where the salutation 'may you be the mother of 1,000 sons' still speaks to a collective fear of an uncertain future, the state has achieved zero population growth. The result is a heartening model of an inclusive Indian society, functional and forward-looking. I saw none of the overwhelming poverty and crowding which make a degree of shock a virtual condition of Indian travel, and my interaction with people was easy and equal. There is a thriving arts scene, and not just in tourist-friendly traditional forms. There are thoroughly modern artists relating to a globalised planet. I visited an exhibition in Kochi's hip Kashi Arts Caf\u00bf showing multimedia works honouring the contemporary great Bhupen Khakar, whose more recent canvases celebrate his controversial (and still illegal) homosexuality. Artistic flair filters through to people's homes, lorries and guest accommodation. Even at the modest end of the scale, I found an aesthetic (and hygienic) quantum leap from the trekkers' rests in the north. At Kochi's Fort House, \u00a310 bought me a pristine, airy, mosquito-proofed room set in a Balinese-style sculpture garden, with a cool stone floor, big white bed and gleaming tiled bathroom. At no extra charge came the services of youthful manager Sanjay Stephen, whose line in suave attentiveness - 'may I book you a massage?', 'did you know there is an organic, locally-made insect repellent that smells exactly like jasmine?', 'I took the liberty of arranging your cab for the airport tomorrow' - that suggests a future at the New York Plaza. Keralans even have the luxury of ethical living. The Kashi Caf\u00bf offers urns of boiled, filtered water to tackle the deluge of discarded plastic bottles that now threatens to engulf India. And Kochi's trendy Idiom bookshops replace plastic carriers with stylish sacking numbers. Noticeboards detail yoga tuition, ayurvedic treatments, eco-tourism, and www.corpwatchindia.org bulletins allege violations of water resources by local Coca-Cola plants. For travellers, Kerala is richly rewarding. Historic centres such as Kochi and the state capital, Thiruvananthapuram, are wildly eclectic architecturally, peppered with monuments to millennia-old traditions of tolerance and integration - Catholic churches, synagogues, mosques, Jain and Hindu temples - and cool hill stations border manicured tea plantations in the mountains. Dazzling festivals and events are a staple, especially Onam, the four-day harvest celebration in September, and August's Nehru Cup Snake Boat Race in Alappuzha, in which huge teams of men row decorated boats up to 100m long. And do it all again in mid-January for the benefit of tourists, for whom the optimum visiting season runs from October to March. I sampled a pleasantly scruffy beach scene at Varkala, where hundreds of eagles surfed thermals over rugged orange laterite cliffs, and each night a crowd of locals materialised on the beach to gasp at the sunsets. Go soon: it will probably become over-developed soon. (Gnosh restaurant also deserves a mention in the Best Gastronomic Pun On A Hindu Deity category.) Here I learnt that the best relief from sunburn was to pay a man 30p to shimmy up a tree and douse me in coconut milk. Also to beware killer keras - falling coconuts claim 500 heads a year in India. Kerala's classic must-see is a boat tour along some of the 1,500km of lagoons, rivers, lakes and backwaters which lace the lowlands. Every kind of fishing craft - and fishermen who simply walk neck-deep in the shallow channels - slid past me, and whole micro-communities living on tiny spits of land. As the sunlight thickened in late afternoon, the landscape melted into a living Gauguin painting. Framed by complicated purple and yellow blossoms, and a thousand shades of green, dark girls wrapped in exotic colours bathed babies at the water's edge. Sunset transformed the scene again, turning the palms into black fireworks against a pink and violet sky. Even public transport runs like a dream. The Great Indian Train Journey changes from an effective but chaotic adventure, frequently preceded by a three-day wait for a ticket, into a comfortable cruise through luscious countryside. In Kerala the third-class passage comes into its own - glassless windows offer premium views and fresh air, there's space to sprawl, and all for about 50p per 100 miles. All this efficiency doesn't threaten the daily idiosyncracies that make Indian travel endlessly entertaining. As I waited on the platform at Varkala station, a crackling Tannoy broke the silence with an electric organ rendition of Mozart's Symphony Number 40. With bossa nova beats.
