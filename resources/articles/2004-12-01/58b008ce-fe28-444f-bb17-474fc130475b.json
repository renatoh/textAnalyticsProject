Robinson already faced playing Wales at Cardiff on February 5 without the Bath centre Mike Tindall, who may be out for another six weeks because of a foot injury. The Rugby Football Union said in a statement last night: Typically, after the operation like the one Will has had, a player can expect to be back into team training after three months and back to full match play after four months.\" Robinson is likely to be without another shoulder injury victim, the Gloucester wing James Simpson-Daniel, who missed the November internationals with a hamstring problem. He is having surgery next Wednesday, when a decision will be made about the length of his recovery period, having damaged his shoulder during the warm-up for a Heineken Cup match against the Cardiff Blues earlier this month. The Wasps centre Stuart Abbott, who has been injured for most of the season, limped out of last Sunday's Powergen Cup win over Bristol with a hamstring strain. Greenwood, a key member of the World Cup winning squad, has struggled to reach peak form this year and was relegated to the bench last month by Robinson. Greenwood and Tindall are the two most experienced midfielders at Robinson's disposal with 55 and 41 caps respectively, and if Tindall is also ruled out next February the head coach's idea of playing Wilkinson at No12 with Charlie Hodgson at fly-half would look more attractive. \"It's disappointing to hear of the injuries to these world class players but I'm pleased to note their progress has so far been positive,\" said Robinson. It's a cause for concern that there appears to be more rugby injuries at this level, and it's important we all protect the welfare and longevity of every professional player.\" Wilkinson, who has not started a match for Newcastle since the middle of October when he aggravated a biceps injury, will be on the bench again when the Falcons play Leeds at Headingley on Monday. Wilkinson played 40 minutes against Edinburgh and Saracens earlier this month, and his club coach Rob Andrew is committed to nursing him back into action after an injury-ravaged year. Wilkinson, like Tindall, is out of contract with his club at the end of the season, but while Newcastle are confident he will commit himself to a new deal Bath are not close to agreement with the England centre, whose availability would interest Leeds. Bath have a strict wage structure which caps salaries at less than \u00a3120,000. Tindall's agent is believed to be seeking a 30% increase on his current \u00a3110,000 a year deal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
