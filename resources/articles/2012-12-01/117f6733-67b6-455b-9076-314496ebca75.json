Tradition having reasserted itself, England's rugby players turned up in an all-white strip to thrill Twickenham against the All Blacks on Saturday. There had been a generally hearty outcry a fortnight ago when the kit sponsors \u2013 in another wretched device to sell replica shirts \u2013 dressed the England XV in garish plum-coloured purple before their hapless defeat by Australia, an outfit memorably described in these pages by Richard Williams as making them resemble \"nothing more than a bunch of damsons in distress\". In recent seasons England have also sported strips of dark blue, vivid red or grey-black \"anthracite\". Will Twickenham ever realise that for romantic traditionalists the matter of ancient teams twinned with ancient colours remains a serious and un-jokey subject? On the very same weekend as English rugby's purple splurge I cannot have been the only one who winced at the picture of a Cardiff City footballer sporting a bright robin-red shirt and not the club's blue of a century. The new Malaysian owners reckon red \"the more dynamic when it comes to marketing our merchandise in Asia\". So Wales's fabled Bluebirds are slaughtered at a stroke. England rugby's narrow-eyed disrespect for traditional values is horribly modern. White, blue, red and green had been the timeless and inviolate robes that satisfied the four home unions since the first international contests in the early 1870s. It was the same at football \u2013 well, not quite and don't tell the SNP that the blue of the saltire was absent from the Scottish national football strip till as far into history as 1900. Until then the national team was adorned in primrose\u2011and\u2011pink hoops in feudal genuflection to the racing colours of the longtime Scottish FA president Lord Archibald Philip \"Primrose\" Rosebery. When it comes to romance, in fairness both Twickenham's and Cardiff's commercial regimes can legitimately ask: \"How long is a legend?\" For instance, time immemorial's Red Devils of Manchester United have, since they were Newton Heath FC, played in the following kaleidoscope of colours: green-and-gold till 1896; white till 1902; red till 1923; white (1927); and for the first half of the 1934 season it was cherry hoops before they settled on plain red shirts. So when does tradition become history? Have Liverpool FC always been the Reds of Anfield and Everton the Blues of Goodison? For the first Merseyside derby in 1893 Liverpool wore royal blue and white quarters, Everton \"ruby\" tops and black shorts. So there. The black-and-yellow of Wasps and the red-and-black of Saracens are probably the most ancient surviving rugby colours of all while, for football, if Arsenal's bespoke and singular white sleeves on red body looks as if they are pre-Victorian, it is only 80 years next spring since manager Herbert Chapman's whim and wheeze about the change. The current rugby internationals have nicely reminded us how the first All Blacks arrived in 1905 with their \"dark blue guernseys\" turning them from a distance into the collective name they happily retain. Two years earlier, on the first official tour by a British side, the South Africans played the first two Tests in white shirts, but for the third at Newlands they wore a set bequeathed them by a local club, the Old Diocesans, which had just folded, so handed over its basket of myrtle-green jerseys to the fledgling international side. And myrtle green it famously remains. The Australian rugby union Wallabies arrived in Britain for a tour in 1928 with their skip of light blue shirts, but at once a horrified Twickenham informed their manager: \"Didn't you know, ol' boy? Cambridge are the only serious club to play in light blue.\" And so they ordered up for them some \"yellow\u2011ochre shirts with optional green piping\". In football, patterns as well as colours remain severely under threat from the commercial greed of men who know the price of everything and the value of nothing. So be ready for a possible last glimpse of the legendary colours of generations \u2013 and each distinctively to their own. It is never the russety-yellow of Wolves but always the sacrosanct old gold; or only the canary of Norwich; it is never the orange but always the tangerine of Blackpool; never the blue of Coventry but only the sky blue; and never the dull red and soft blue of Burnley, Villa or the Hammers but always, always, only the claret and blue. The same went for the patterns: the stripes of Stoke and the Sheffields; the blue \"halves\" of Blackburn, the blue \"quarters\" of Bristol Rovers, the blue hoops of Queens Park Rangers, the green ones of Celtic; the black verticals of good ol' Newcastle and prehistoric Notts County \u2026 One of the loveliest stories of recent times \u2013 with regular and happy reminders this autumn of the Italian club's stylish progress in the Champions League \u2013 was the invitation from that mighty institution Juventus to ancient but unlikely little Notts County, 150 last week and the world's oldest football club currently professional, to be guests of honour and opponents at last year's opening of their new stadium. County were the 1903 donors of a set of black-and-white-striped shirts to the boys' club which was to grow into the one and only, and massive Juve. Hooray for both of them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
