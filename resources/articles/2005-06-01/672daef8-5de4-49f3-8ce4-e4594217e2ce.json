Can you suggest an investment which would have higher returns than putting the money into a high-interest saving account? I know nothing about investing in stock and shares, so I would feel uncomfortable going that way. MQ A You could consider National Savings Certificates. The 29th issue runs for a two-year term and pays a fixed interest rate of 3% tax-free. Whether this is competitive depends on whether you are a standard or higher-rate taxpayer. You add either 20% (standard) or 40%(higher-rate) to the 3%. Even if the rate is a bit lower, you would have a very safe investment, backed by the government. Furthermore as it is a fixed rate, it may become more competitive if the forecasts of a reduction in interest rates over the next two years prove to be accurate. Remember, however, that you would receive reduced interest if you did not leave the money invested for the full two-year term. If this rate is too low, I'm afraid the only alternative is to shop around amongst the banks and building societies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
