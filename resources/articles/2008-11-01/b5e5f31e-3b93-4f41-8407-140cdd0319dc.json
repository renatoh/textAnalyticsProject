The England midfielder travelled to Colorado for a meeting with renowned surgeon Dr Richard Steadman after being plagued by a tedinnitis problem for almost two years. And Manchester United have confirmed Hargreaves has had surgery on his right knee and will have a further operation on his left knee in a fortnight, ruling him out for the remainder of the campaign. Hargreaves has made only three appearances for United since May's Champions League Final triumph over Chelsea in Moscow, one of them an effective performance against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, and has become increasingly frustrated at a problem that would not go away. Sir Alex Ferguson confirmed on Friday that Hargreaves had recently seen specialists in London and Sweden without being able to get the injury resolved, sparking fears his career might be in jeopardy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
