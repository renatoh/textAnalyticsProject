But this weekend, a couple of hundred miles from Soho Square as the crow flies, a cup triumph could be masterminded by a man from Yorkshire. Steve McClaren will this afternoon lead his FC Twente team into Rotterdam's De Kuip Stadion for the Dutch Cup final. It is the climax to a season that should make all of us who sneered at his appointment at an unfashionable club in Holland, who sniggered at a television interview where he took on a comedy accent, feel a little ashamed. Ever since he waded through the quicksand of the England job, grinning that fixed smile as he sank, McClaren has been a soft target. Former England managers have always struggled to scrub the mud that comes with the territory off their reputations. The umbrella pose, the \"wally with the brolly\" headline, will forever be part of McClaren in a way that only Graham Taylor, Glenn Hoddle and Sven-Goran Eriksson can empathise with. That a turnip, Eileen Drewery and Ulrika Jonsson conjure up that trio's time in an FA blazer as evocatively as any result is proof of that. Although McClaren rejects the idea that his season in Holland has been a form of rehabilitation, he surely feels unburdened by the sweet air of celebration that swirls around FC Twente. Two weeks ago the club finished second in the Eredivisie. The players were given big bunches of flowers and they duly set upon their manager, whacking him with their blooms in a Dutch version of the bumps. It was McClaren's birthday. Twente finished behind AZ Alkmaar but ahead of Holland's big three, Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord. If they can beat Heerenveen in the cup final it will be their most successful season ever. So McClaren chose very well. Last summer he had been interested in the vacant position at Blackburn that ended up costing Paul Ince a chunk of his reputation. It is easy to imagine how unforgiving the Premier League would have been at the slightest slip. Twente are off the beaten track enough that he could get on with it in relative peace, yet have enough quality and ambition for any achievements to be noted. Last week a spokesman in their press office observed drily that there had been a lot of interest from England all of a sudden. McClaren is still cautious of a character assassination. He let his guard down enough to admit: \"I was probably due to fall, but it was a hard fall.\" His season has been played out in a very supportive environment, though he had to quash a fair amount of scepticism on his arrival. Given how familiar the Dutch are with English football, their opinions were based on a watered-down version of our tabloid newspapers. The locals, who had just lost a highly regarded coach to the Bundesliga, were not hugely enthusiastic to start with. Probably the most sensible thing McClaren did was to bide his time. He did not crash around trying to make a big impression, but worked solidly and subtly with the available material. People soon warmed to him because they admired his penchant for playing in a Dutch-style flexible 4-3-3 system. They even found, to their surprise, that McClaren sent out one of the nicest teams to watch in the Eredivisie. He also passed the Johan Cruyff test. \"All I did was come and try not to get in the way,\" he says. Foreign managers are not so commonplace in Holland. Why would they be, when they grow so many clever football strategists of their own? But how strange it seems to consider that an imported coach winning silverware could be a rarity. McClaren is one of the few homegrown managers to have won a trophy in England since the birth of the Premier League 16 seasons ago. Joe Royle and Harry Redknapp have won the FA Cup with Everton and Portsmouth respectively, and McClaren, Ron Atkinson, Roy Evans and Brian Little claimed the League Cup. That's a grand total of six of the last 51 trophies that will have been awarded by the end of this season. Roy Keane's unsympathetic assessment that the success of a manager can be judged only on silverware does not really work in the Premier League, given how rare it is for anybody outside the big four to win the prizes. Below that glass ceiling, Redknapp and Aston Villa's Martin O'Neill are the only managers working in the Premier League who have a major English honour on their CV. The more you think about it, the more obvious it is that McClaren should be grateful he ended up in Enschede instead of Blackburn. Now that he is safely back on his feet, the burning question is what McClaren does next. Rumours have linked him with the notoriously difficult Ajax job from which Marco van Basten recently resigned. The Germans are always keen to pick up the best of the Dutch league coaches, as proved by Louis van Gaal's move to Bayern Munich having won the league with AZ. And it would not be stretching the imagination for an English club to woo him back home. It's funny how his record at the Riverside looks even better all of a sudden given Middlesbrough's plight. For the moment, he has said he is happy to stay where he is, a big fish in a small, pleasant town near the German border in a rural area of Holland. In recent years Twente have improved steadily. Having virtually doubled their capacity to 24,000, they played in front of a packed, appreciative audience the whole season long. Twente are a club who like to present themselves as on the rise, in more ways than one. They recently brought out a line of condoms, and the chairman, Joop Munsterman, was happy to use a sales pitch dreamed up by his wife: \"Stand up for FC Twente\". At least, as McClaren might have noted with some relief, the jokes are no longer on him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
