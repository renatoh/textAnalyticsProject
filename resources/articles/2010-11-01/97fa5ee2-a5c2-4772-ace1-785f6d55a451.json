Maude was speaking after publishing 194,000 items of government spending since the election, revealing for the first time the scale of the private sector's role in the state. Some firms received more than whole government departments to deliver services. He said: \"Some margins in some of the contracts \u2026 were not evidence of the contracts having been very rigorously negotiated. They were too rich. Part of it is the terms which are not toughly negotiated so [there is] insufficient control \u2013 people [are] able to make too much money.\" David Cameron said the publication of government spending data would \"act as a powerful straitjacket on spending that will save us a lot of money\". Cameron announced that the Freedom of Information Act would be extended so that people can request any government datasets for \"personal or commercial\" reasons. From January the government will also publish details of all contracts worth more than \u00a325,000, to allow other companies to undercut them and force costs down. More details about the way government uses taxpayers' money emerged today as the records were made publicly available and people began to pore through them. A thorough analysis of departmental spending on postage, phone bills, hospitality, utilities, printing and agency fees, conducted by respected data blogger David McCandless, reveals that some have spent significant proportions of their overall budgets on back-office functions. The Cabinet Office spent \u00a31.165m on hospitality, dwarfing other departments. The Department for International Development spent just \u00a3985 on hospitality in the same five months. In agency fees for casual staff, the Government Equalities Office spent 16.4% of its income \u2013 \u00a34m in total \u2013 on agency staff. The Department for Energy and Climate Change appeared to have spent 16% of its budget \u2013 \u00a375m \u2013 on utility bills, while the Ministry of Defence and Cabinet Office both spent 5%. There was continued focus on the role of the biggest companies in the state. After the \u00a33.3bn paid to Capita (including provisions for teachers' pensions), property firm Telereal Trillium was the second largest supplier, receiving \u00a3569.5m and HP Enterprise the third largest with an income of \u00a3435.3m for IT services. Maude has been renegotiating the biggest contracts and claims to have already saved \u00a3800m on deals with the top 19 companies. He is now negotiating with the next 34 biggest suppliers, meeting each and signing new agreements on the savings they will make. He admitted he was likely to face fierce opposition from companies to the government's insistence that all future contracts will have confidentiality clauses removed and will subsequently be published in full \u2013 unless there are reasons of national security, personal confidentiality or in cases where there were \"compelling\" legal reasons. \"Have we had representations? Probably, I have no idea, but I wouldn't be surprised,\" Maude said. \"We're an important customer, this is the way we're going to do business. The presumption would be against confidentiality clauses.\" Maude also gave more details of plans to create a new \"public data corporation\" responsible for collating and releasing government data sets, merging the Ordnance Survey (OS), the Met Office, Land Registry and perhaps Companies House from next April. There is likely to be strong opposition to the plans as the government is considering selling part of the company to the private sector when it is created after April 2011. That will cause unease among public sector unions and others concerned that the quality of essential services such as OS maps and weather forecasting could be compromised by private shareholders seeking profit by reducing quality on unprofitable areas. Maude said that the initial aim was to create a central repository. \"Its principal objective is to enable us to release data on a uniform basis. Its second priority is to get synergy from bringing together different organisations, reducing overheads and getting operational expertise in collecting and managing and distributing data.\" Maude said it would be \"ridiculous\" to debar companies whose employees are related to ministers after the Cabinet Office was criticised for paying the legal firm that employs Miriam Gonz\u00e1lez Dur\u00e1ntez, Nick Clegg's wife, \u00a388,000 this year. DLA Piper, one of the country's largest legal practices, has a contract to monitor government compliance with employment laws. Maude said the contract dated back to 2008 and that there were strict rules about conflicts of interest. \"It would be pretty unreasonable if whenever any politician's, any minister's relations were involved in any company, that company was automatically debarred from having business with government.\" Class acts The Foreign and Commonwealth Office spent just under \u00a3150,000 with the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) to teach senior staff to increase their \"personal impact\" in \"ambassadorial charisma\" classes. A spokesman said: \"Like other departments, the FCO uses Rada Enterprises, a recognised training company, for senior staff on increasing personal impact. Our diplomats need to meet and influence world leaders and opinion formers to promote British interests. This training helps them to do that skilfully and with confidence.\" The Department for Culture, Media and Sport spent \u00a395,506 on flag-flying. A DCMS spokesman said it was responsible for providing and managing the flag-flying services for ceremonial state occasions, including state visits, trooping of the colour and special flag days, for example Commonwealth Day, UN Day and Europe Day. Brophy LTD is contracted to put flags up and down in the Mall, Parliament Square, Horse Guards Road and Windsor. It also carries out maintenance and safety checks on the flag poles. A second firm, Flag Consultancy, provides new flags. The Treasury spent \u00a32.5m on advisers to Sir John Chadwick who was appointed in January 2009 to work out how much compensation Equitable Life policyholders should get. The Treasury said: \"The work \u2026 was essential to establishing the relative loss figure for policyholders. It was the first time bottom-up estimates of losses suffered by policyholders as a result of government maladministration had been calculated. This work was incredibly complex in nature. It involved looking at over 30m premium payments in 2m policies held by approximately 1.5m policyholders.\" Chadwick's advice to limit payouts to between \u00a3400m and \u00a3500m was described as \"unsafe and unsound\" by the parliamentary ombudsman, which felt between \u00a34bn and \u00a34.8bn would be more appropriate.
