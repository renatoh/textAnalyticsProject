The production, with the well-established Sheffield-based Compass Theatre Company, was to start this month. A week before Christmas, Arts Council England terminated the company's core funding of \u00a3232,000 without warning (Letters, December 21) and so the tour has been pulled. Compass's future seems bleak, and everyone has been thrust out of work - some of us having given up chances of employment elsewhere to do a play we believe in. Sixteen venues around the country are now deprived of Compass, which specialises extremely successfully in vibrant interpretations of classical plays. This is just another example of savage, cavalier cuts to theatre funding, hot on the heels of similar stories concerning the Bristol Old Vic, Derby Playhouse, Northcott Exeter and Yvonne Arnaud in Guildford. From first-hand experience, I really fear for our dramatic heritage and for those now entering my profession.
