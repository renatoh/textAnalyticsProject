The acting US ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, told Congress that Trump\u2019s order in mid-July to cut off security assistance triggered a series of high-level meetings with cabinet members on how to get it resumed, given the urgency of the Russian military intervention in eastern Ukraine. Taylor testified on 22 October, but the House committees holding impeachment hearings released a full transcript on Wednesday. The veteran ambassador told congressional investigators it was the \u201cunanimous opinion of every level of inter-agency discussion\u201d that the aid should be restored and that the secretaries of state and defence as well as the CIA director and the national security adviser work together to arrange an urgent meeting with Trump \u201cto convince him to release the hold\u201d. However, no meeting could be arranged until September. Taylor said part of the reason was the cabinet secretaries involved went on work trips abroad during the period, but he added: \u201cI think this was also about the time of the Greenland question, about purchasing Greenland, which took up a lot of energy in the NSC [National Security Council].\u201d On 20 August, Trump cancelled a trip to Denmark on the grounds that the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, had \u201cno interest in discussing the purchase of Greenland\u201d. Frederiksen had called the US president\u2019s proposal to purchase the semi-autonomous Danish territory \u201can absurd discussion\u201d. Trump had said two days earlier he was actively looking into the idea but it was not a priority. \u201cStrategically it\u2019s interesting and we\u2019d be interested, but we\u2019ll talk to them a little bit,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s not number one on the burner, I can tell you that.\u201d Taylor\u2019s remarks suggest Trump\u2019s Greenland purchase idea consumed considerable resources at the NSC, at the expense of other issues which the rest of his administration considered national security priorities. Taylor has testified that it eventually became clear to him that Trump, through his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was withholding the security assistance as a form of leverage to convince the Ukrainian government to investigate the president\u2019s political rivals. Adam Schiff, the chair of the House committee who was leading the questioning of Taylor, observed that the revelation about the role of Trump\u2019s temporary preoccupation with Greenland was \u201cdisturbing for a whole different reason\u201d. Taylor agreed it was \u201ca different story\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
