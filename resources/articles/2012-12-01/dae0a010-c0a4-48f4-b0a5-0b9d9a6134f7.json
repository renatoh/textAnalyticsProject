The European champions, who arrived at their base in Yokohama on Sunday, will play the Mexican club Monterrey in Thursday's semi-final before a potential showpiece against the imposing Copa Libertadores winners Corinthians. The Brazilians are seeking to return the Club World Cup to South America for the first time since 2006 after five years of dominance from the likes of Barcelona, Manchester United, Internazionale and Milan, and would represent daunting opponents in Sunday's final at the Yokohama international stadium. \"In Brazil, this has always been seen as the one opportunity for our clubs to play against one of the big European teams,\" said Oscar. \"That opportunity doesn't come around very often, and this was always seen as the chance for them to test themselves against a big opponent from Europe, and to go and show their football to the world. When it became the 'Club World Cup' instead of the Intercontinental Cup, the whole world outside Europe started to take it seriously because it was the only way they could face a stronger team and test themselves against the best. \"Nowadays, even the European clubs have started to take the competition more seriously and they've been winning rather than the South Americans. The European teams have won the last five times and this is a trend we hope to continue, but I know they have always found it very difficult. \"It is not an easy competition to win. For Chelsea, we are representing Europe and we are going there with a determination to do it well. It's a very important title, worldwide, and one Chelsea have never won. If we do, it is going to give us so much more confidence and strength for the rest of the season. It would give us the chance to keep building on the back of all these [recent] results. That's what I'm hoping for and expecting.\" Oscar, 21, has special personal motivation to excel against Corinthians, having grown up a S\u00e3o Paulo supporter. \"They are great rivals, the two biggest clubs in S\u00e3o Paulo state,\" he said. \"There are so many big clubs in Brazil but Corinthians have the largest fan base in the country, maybe along with Flamengo. We have to be aware because Corinthians are going to take a huge group of supporters to Japan, even though it is so far away, and they're a strong team with many excellent players. \"Paulinho, for example, plays with me in the national team and has been outstanding in Brazil. He'll be one of the stars of the competition, so we have to be careful.\" Oscar has reason to be wary, having experienced this tournament before, the midfielder part of the Internacional side defeated by Mazembe from Congo in the 2010 semi-final. As it transpired, Rafael Ben\u00edtez's Internazionale prevailed comfortably in the final against the African champions. \"I was only 19 but it was a great experience for me,\" added the midfielder. \"Unfortunately, we were all expecting to get to the final and it was such a big surprise for us when we lost to Mazembe. Very disappointing. I am pleased to have the second opportunity to take part again and I hope that this time I will get to the final and get a trophy at the end of it. \"I am really not sure why but Brazil and Japan seem to have this special connection. Brazilians love Japan and the Japanese seem to love Brazil. There are so many Japanese people who live in Brazil: my wife Ludmila's grandfather is Japanese. The countries have this special link and this is one of the reasons why so many fans from Corinthians will be in Japan for the tournament. But I am concentrating on Chelsea. We are improving and I'm absolutely sure that we will be ready to fight for this title.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
