The emergency services network (ESN), which is supposed to replace the existing Airwave system, will cost \u00a39.3bn and will not be in service until after 2022, according to the National Audit Office. A highly critical report released on Friday has concluded the 49% increase in cost to the taxpayer is the fault of the Home Office\u2019s management. The delay could go well beyond 2022, it added. May \u2013 as home secretary in 2011 under the premiership of David Cameron \u2013 signed off the plans to buy ESN as a cheaper and better option to replace Airwave. Sir Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, said the Home Office must draw up a comprehensive plan if it is to introduce the new system, which is critical to the police, ambulance and fire services. \u201c[The Home Office] has already been through one costly reset and is in danger of needing another unless it gets its house in order,\u201d he said. Emergency services have communicated using the Airwave dedicated digital radio network since 2000. It is used by all police, fire and ambulance services in England, Scotland and Wales, for communications between control rooms and teams in the field, as well as 363 other organisations including local authorities and train operating companies. The ESN service is intended to match Airwave in all respects. It is supposed to allow users to take advantage of high-speed mobile data and save money by sharing an existing commercial 4G network. Auditors said a ministerial decision was expected to find ESN would not be as resilient to power cuts as the current system. Technology needed to allow emergency services to communicate effectively using ESN is not yet ready, according to the watchdog. It said aircraft such as police helicopters were currently unable to receive the signal needed to communicate with those on the ground and devices were unable to communicate directly with one another without a network signal. It had been expected emergency services would start using ESN in September 2017, with the transition completed at the end of this year. By 2017, the Home Office had realised its plan was not achievable. Last year the department announced a \u201creset\u201d of its approach, based on a phased introduction of ESN services, rather than launching the whole programme at once. The latest plan is for Airwave to be switched off in December 2022. The NAO report said: \u201cThere are still significant risks and, based on past performance, it seems unlikely that ESN can be delivered by the target date of 2022.\u201d Of the extra cost rise, \u00a31.4bn is the cost of extending Airwave, \u00a3500m is an increase in contingency, and the rest of the programme is forecast to cost \u00a31.2bn more \u2013 but all forecast costs are highly uncertain, auditors said. Meg Hillier, the chair of the public accounts committee, has warned ESN\u2019s implementation must not be allowed to fail. \u201cESN is to be used by police, firefighters and ambulance crews for the communications they need to do their life-saving jobs. The Home Office must take an urgent and honest examination of its ability to deliver to its new schedule for this critical project,\u201d she said. A Home Office spokeswoman did not address the criticisms in the NAO\u2019s report, but instead released a statement that said ESN was \u201con track to deliver an ambitious, world-leading digital communications network for the emergency services by 2022\u201d. She added: \u201cWhen fully implemented, its mobile technology and infrastructure will transform the emergency response of police officers, firefighters and ambulance crews. This will result in faster and better treatment for victims.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
