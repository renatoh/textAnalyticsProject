Mr Blair's official spokesman said the whole of No 10 was \"delighted\" at the scenes portrayed from the Iraqi capital. The PM believes they demonstrated the burden Saddam had imposed on his people and their joy at the oppression being lifted. But No 10 also exercised caution, saying victory was far from complete. Meanwhile Mr Blair told MPs that coalition forces still did not know who was competent now to offer unconditional surrender on behalf of the ruling regime. Asked when the instant of victory might come, Mr Blair's spokesman said: \"I think we will know that moment when we see it.\" Mr Blair was expected to speak to US president, George Bush, later tonight to discuss the extraordinary scenes in the Iraqi capital. Earlier today, at prime minister's questions, he told the Commons: \"In relation to whom we would take a surrender from, it's extremely difficult, as we speak, to know what's left of the governing higher ranks of Saddam's regime. \"We must be clear that whoever we accept a final declaration from, that so far as Saddam's regime is concerned the war is over, whoever it is, has the appropriate authority.\" On whether victory had already in effect been achieved, Mr Blair's spokesman said: \"I think it is premature, whenever there are still parts of the country that the coalition does not yet control and when the situation on the ground in Baghdad remains as fluid as it is. \"That caution should not in any way give the impression that we do not celebrate alongside these people who are celebrating and in no way should it detract from their gratitude for lifting the burden of Saddam from their shoulders.\" In the Commons, Mr Blair cautioned MPs: \"This conflict is not over yet. There are still some very difficult things to do and, as we speak, there is still resistance ... among those parts of Saddam's regime that want to cling to power. \"So it's not over yet.\" But asked whether the prime minister later watched the TV pictures of Iraqis trying to topple a statue of Saddam and the scenes of general jubilation, his spokesman replied: \"We are all, as you would expect, watching these images, along with the rest of the country, and are delighted at what we are seeing in the reaction of people on the ground. \"It shows what the ordinary people thought of Saddam and just how much of a burden his rule has placed on them. We have seen today the scales of fear falling from the people of Iraq.\" But there was little disguising the private relief and celebration in No 10 as the war against Saddam's regime appeared all but over. \"A substantial part of the country we can say with certainty is free of violence,\" said Mr Blair's spokesman. He admitted No 10 still did not know the fate of Saddam amid a swirl of conflicting rumours, but added that the Iraqi leader's option of exile ended once conflict began, saying that if he was still alive \"we do believe he should be brought to justice\". Looking ahead, the spokesman indicated UN weapons inspectors would be welcome to verify any finds of chemical or biological weapons made by the coalition forces. \"We all want the world to see the truth whenever we find weapons of mass destruction,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
