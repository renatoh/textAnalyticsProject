An emergency report into the cracked Opal Tower was completed in February by prominent university deans of architecture after the brand-new building was dramatically evacuated in December. Five recommendations were handed down to improve building quality, reform certification and prevent it from happening again. On Wednesday the government\u2019s minister for better regulation, Kevin Anderson, said he had just released a discussion paper calling for \u201cstakeholder input\u201d on reforms that included many of the Opal recommendations. But Engineers Australia say the changes are years overdue and were obvious before the cracks emerged in Opal Tower and in Mascot Towers this month. The main recommendation of the Opal Tower report was to create an official registry of engineers who would then be used to provide independent third-party certification of designs and on-site inspections during construction. Jonathan Russell from Engineers Australia said the recommendations from Opal Tower were in fact already recommended a year earlier \u2013 in February 2018. \u201cThe Opal Tower recommendations of February 2019 are largely reflected in the Building Ministers Forum [BMF] report of a year earlier. This includes a recommendation to require engineers to be registered to practice. \u201cWhen calculating the time to take action, the starting point is February 2018, not February 2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThe real question is if there has been any progress on implementing the BMF report recommendations of February 2018. And the answer is, not nearly enough.\u201d Russell said many members of the public assumed wrongly that the engineers register already existed. \u201cThe general public and home investors have simply assumed that engineers must be registered to practice in NSW. That is not the case \u2013 anyone can call themselves an engineer.\u201d Mehreen Faruqi, a federal Greens senator for NSW and former civil engineer, said the registry was \u201ccommon sense\u201d and \u201cshould have been done years ago\u201d. \u201cThese reforms are urgently needed. As a professional civil engineer, I think it is pretty ridiculous we still have a situation where there is no register. \u201cEngineering associations have been calling for things like a registry of qualified engineers for years.\u201d The Opal Tower report in February also made other recommendations: the creation of an open repository for certifications (\u201cto raise the accountability of certification processes\u201d) and the creation of a Building Structure Review Board. On Wednesday, Anderson said the government was \u201ccommitted to getting important reforms right\u201d. The discussion paper, called Building Stronger Foundations, contained four reforms. As well as the registry of engineers, it floats the introduction of an industry-wide duty of care, which would allow a homeowner to seek compensation if a building developer or builder had been negligent, and the appointment of a building commissioner. A duty of care had previously been recommended by the Owners Corporation Network, who advocate for homebuyers. \u201cThe problem with building is that it is not always clear who owes a duty of care to who,\u201d their chairman Phillip Gall told Guardian Australia earlier in June. Anderson said people now had the \u201copportunity to provide feedback\u201d to the ideas. \u201cThe legislation will implement many of the recommendations from the Lambert and Shergold-Weir reports into the building industry, and now we want to hear from industry and the wider community to help finalise the legislation. \u201cWe are committed to getting these important reforms right and ensuring they are developed in close consultation with the industry and community.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
