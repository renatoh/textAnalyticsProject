How else to explain the findings from More in Common about our political allegiances? Far from being broadly left or right leaning, with Ed Davey\u2019s rump somewhere in the middle (not a pretty image, I grant you), we apparently belong to one of seven political tribes. These are progressive activists, civil pragmatists, disengaged battlers, established liberals, loyal nationals, disengaged traditionalists and backbone Conservatives. I think I can understand established liberals and backbone Conservatives, but I find the rest quite bewildering. So, sorry, More in Common, but I think I\u2019ll stick to the tried and tested. So much simpler. Are you thinking of upping sticks and moving house? Well, you could do worse than follow Prue Leith\u2019s example. She\u2019s put her Cotswold home on the market for a cool \u00a310m and placed it in the hands, according to one report, of a \u201cboutique estate agent\u201d. No, I haven\u2019t got a clue what can be boutique about an estate agency either. Still, if it is all too much for you, get away from it all by booking, courtesy of Saga, a \u201cboutique cruise\u201d. Again, me neither. Headline of the week comes courtesy of the Daily Telegraph: \u201cScottish pubs to reopen, but alcohol is banned.\u201d I know we live in trying times, but I\u2019m not sure which bright spark dreamed up this inane concept. And word of the week comes from the Times\u2019s polygon puzzle - \u201cclodpole\u201d - a foolish, awkward or clumsy person. I do hope the uncharitable among you, especially of the drinking fraternity in Scotland, aren\u2019t thinking that this could possibly be applied to Nicola Sturgeon. \u2022Jonathan Bouquet is an Observer columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
