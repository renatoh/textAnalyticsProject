Mr Allen said today's extraordinary general meeting - the last held by Granada before the merger - represented a \"poignant moment\" for the company. And he confirmed that the new chairman or chairwoman would not be appointed until after February 2, when the newly formed ITV plc is expected to start trading after shareholders overwhelmingly voted for the merger between Carlton and Granada today. \"The nominations committee led by Sir Brian Pitman [the acting chairman of ITV plc] are meeting a number of candidates and have started the interviewing process,\" said Mr Allen. \"We are hopeful that a timetable of February or March will be achieved.\" The post has been vacant ever since Michael Green, the chairman of Carlton, was ignominiously ousted last October. He had been lined up for the same role at ITV plc but after a shareholder revolt he was forced to accept that with Mr Allen as chief executive, the appointment would have breached corporate governance rules. Several names have been linked to the post, including the former Vodafone chief executive Sir Christopher Gent, and the former head of the England and Wales Cricket Board, Lord MacLaurin - currently chairman of Vodafone. There is also speculation that Hans Snook, the chairman of Carphone Warehouse and former Orange boss, is being considered after he was linked to a similar post at Channel 4. Mr Allen today disclosed that the shortlist of half a dozen included people from outside the broadcasting industry. Granada shareholders voted in favour of the merger at an extraordinary general meeting in Westminster, with the support from 99% of shareholders coming just hours after Carlton investors gave their backing to the union. While Granada saw its proposal to get the merger through comfortably passed, there was a minor rebellion over executive rewards. Over 5% of shareholders voted against two types of executive pay package, a share option scheme and a commitment plan. Mr Allen would not put a figure on the number of job losses that will be sustained when the ITV merger goes through. Over 250 jobs have already gone at some of ITV's divisions and there are fears of a widespread cull at its sales houses and programming operations. The merger will give ITV plc control of 11 of the 15 franchises in the network including LWT, Merdian and Granada in Manchester, and will mean the company is responsible for over 50% of television advertising. Mr Allen said he had no immediate plans to acquire the Scottish franchises of ITV, which are owned by SMG, arguing that it was \"not about timing\". \"It's about do they want to sell and is it at the right price,\" he said. He also denied that the merger was in essence a takeover by Granada, which will account for 68% of the merged ITV. \"This is one company that, frankly, always needed to come together,\" he said. \"The deal that was structured was a good deal. The issue is about getting on and delivering the benefits, which is why we are seeing the share price moving as it is moving.\" The combined value of Carlton and Granada has mushroomed by more than \u00a33.5bn in less than a year. Last March, it had hit rock bottom with a market capitalisation of \u00a31.7bn but it is worth \u00a35.5bn today. The higher the price rises, the more potential buyers from overseas such as Viacom or Hollywood mogul Haim Saban will be put off. \"As to foreign players coming in, we will continue to drive this business forwards,\" Mr Allen said. \"If we do that, we will continue to remain as an independent public limited company.\" He said he had received \"no approaches\" from potential buyers. Earlier today Carlton shareholders gave the merger the green light as Michael Green brought the 20-year history of the company to a close. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
