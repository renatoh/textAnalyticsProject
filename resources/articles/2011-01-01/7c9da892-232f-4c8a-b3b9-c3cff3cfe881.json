Or that Kanye West has pulled on a pair of pumps and is about to tackle Swan Lake for the Royal Ballet? Nope, I thought not. They're both ridiculous ideas. No amateur performer, however plucky, could expect to just parachute into the professional arena. Yet there's one artform where this sort of thing is happening more and more: standup comedy. Recent debutants include Lembit Opik, Gail Porter, Tommy Sheridan and Hardeep Singh Kohli. But two more celebs have now realised that, unnoticed by the rest of us, comedy is where their talents truly lie. One is 1960s armed robber turned journalist John McVicar (heckle if you dare). The other is rapper Sean Combs, in whose adoption of a succession of cuddly toy names (Diddy, Puffy, Daddy, Flopsy) a sense of fun has long been evident. Time was, standup was held to be a terrifying pursuit. Taking to the stage alone, obliged to be instantly hilarious, is the stuff of nightmares. Back then, public figures who wanted stage time chose instead the low-pressure An Evening With format. Tony Benn did it, so did \"Mad\" Frankie Fraser. But now, with comedy booming and its sense of danger fading, people look at standup and think: I could do that. Are they right? Interviewing Tim Vine recently, we debated the relative merits of observational versus one-liner comedy. I argued that, whereas the skill is visible in one-liner comedy, some observational comedy can seem like pub chat. Yes, said Vine, but making it seem like pub chat is the skill. Fair enough, I said, but no matter the skill, you're still stuck with pub chat. But Vine is right to point out that making standup look easy \u2013 in defiance of the hothouse atmosphere in which it usually takes place \u2013 is no cakewalk. And so, heading off to review a famous comedy rookie, the critic is conflicted. The novelty of the event, and its newsworthiness, gets the juices flowing. But \u2013 sorry McVicar, sorry Flopsy \u2013 these debutants are often terrible. To consider oneself a bit of a wag is one thing. To be a standup is quite another.
