But the only thing \"super\" about the local, London and European elections on June 10 is likely to be the record abstention of Labour voters. One minister out and about in the safest of constituencies last weekend could not find one voter prepared to cast their X for Labour. Labour voters are on strike. Yet the ideological barricades are as crystal clear as ever. \"Better services. Lower taxes\" is the Tory promise. \"Britain's working. Don't let the Tories wreck it again\" is Labour's. Well-worn these may be, but they represent their parties. How honest is the Tory slogan? Michael Howard's claim that Conservative councils will \"cost you less but deliver more\" is the same old mirage - having your cake and eating it (and not getting fat either). It is a familiar code that voters well understand. Conservatives out of office always promise lower taxes, and the \"better services\" part is just a fig leaf to cover the indecency of appealing to naked greed. No one likes to think themselves selfish; people pride themselves on voting in the national interest. The necessary accompanying myth is that all tax is always wasted on \"red tape\" and \"pen-pushing bureaucrats\". There is never a shortage of bad anecdotes about a public-service failure among the million NHS treatments a day. How easy for Howard yesterday to produce a few quotes from some bad Ofsted reports, without mentioning the overall statistics that show such improvement since 1997. How well is Howard doing? Well enough to bring out the voters who stayed home at the last two elections - but that's nowhere near enough. Simon Atkinson, of Mori, points to the remarkable stability of all the polls, showing Labour and Tories level, or Labour slightly ahead. The real story is Labour's remarkable strength. By every previous mid-term rule it should be crashing through the floor; Mrs Thatcher always trailed badly mid-term. Labour should be on its knees as one calamity follows another in Iraq, and Tony Blair stumbles from crisis to blunder. Trying to seize back the initiative, he exudes a manic hyper-energy, compulsively making speeches and unexpected announcements. He has lost aplomb. However, \"Britain is working\", his party's campaign theme, though hardly inspiring, hits the spot where most voters seem to be. The litany of Labour's economic success is becoming as boring as Gordon Brown's delivery: lowest inflation, interest rates and unemployment; best growth and best results ever in just about anything you care to measure. Polls suggest most people do acknowledge this, however grudgingly. Howard has had all the advantage he's going to get and, suggests Mori, barring future calamities, Blair has probably taken all the hits he will take over Iraq and his unpopular Bush alliance. There should be no serious problem for Labour. But then comes the great unknowable. Pollsters admit they are not good at predicting turnout, and people tend to lie when asked how certain they are to vote. Already this time fewer than ever before claim they are going to vote. \"Won't vote\" is the defiant stance Labour MPs are finding everywhere - not apathy, but anger. Labour admits it is in for a pasting, but no amount of discounting a bad result in advance can prepare them for what may happen. What if June brings the worst mid-term result ever recorded for a government? What if virtually no one votes Labour? Permanent discontent is the eternal fate of left-of-centre voters; an election few think matters offers a risk-free chance to send Blair a ferociously satisfying message. The party may rationalise a crushing defeat, trusting that Labour voters will keep the Tories out in a general election. But the shock might have an impetus of its own, sending waves of panic among the many backbenchers facing expulsion, even if Labour were to win a workable majority. A mighty collapse of its vote breaks the magic of Labour's invincibility, and a Liberal Democrat surge may take on a trajectory of its own. In an electoral era that has broken the old rule books, there is no knowing what a near-zero Labour vote might do. What would it do to Blair? Never underestimate his resilience or the underlying support still in the polls for the party he leads. At home on every measurement all public services are improving at a rate never seen before. But even so, he will stagger under a wipe-out on June 10. With only a few weeks to go, it's far too late to pull rabbits out of hats. His recent announcements look like panic measures - cutting immigrants' benefits or even his first, welcome, promise for a universal system of children's centres for all under-fives (eventually, with no money or fixed date). In the current mood he could promise the earth, and the press would wait politely until the end of his speech to ask, as again yesterday, when he's going to go. There is probably little now that would get his own core vote out in June. It's his own fault: he always prized the relatively few switchers at the expense of his own people. If he survived a humiliation, would he spend the next year making sure he recaptured the Labour vote? That is far from certain, however much his colleagues would urge it. That inflexible part of him forged in the defeat of 1992 does not risk alienating Worcester woman, Mondeo man or any of those polling phantasms he thinks put him into power. \"Choice\" is his mantra, a politically empty idea essentially at odds with social justice. Faced with a voters' strike, he would need to take radical risks with his imaginary middle England. He might find that rediscovering clear, visionary leadership would allow him more progressive steps than he ever realised, without losing public support. Some well-chosen fights with the Tories would be defining: why not take on taxing the super-rich and watch Howard squirm in their defence? If the Lib Dems do well in June, Labour voters may only return with an offer of policies worth fighting and voting for. Gordon Brown, writing on these pages, yesterday allowed no sliver of linguistic difference with his leader, claiming unconvincingly: \"United as a party, we must hold firm to our enduring Labour values.\" But if June 10 is as bad as expected, that unity will be egg-shell fragile. The party will urge Blair to find more of those Labour values and make them his own. That would go against his political grain, which says he owes his victories to defying his party's instincts. His party has been willing to follow his political genius through two glorious general elections, but Iraq has deeply dented that respect. They may demand the leader change or be changed unless he can adapt to what may feel like changed circumstances after June 10. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
