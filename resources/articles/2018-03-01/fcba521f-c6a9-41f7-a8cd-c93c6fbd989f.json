In a letter to the prime minister on Friday, Bill Shorten said that the Hodgman government\u2019s policies represent a \u201cdirect threat to [the] essential national consensus\u201d achieved by the national firearms agreement. The changes \u2013 released to shooting groups and farmers and revealed just the day before the election \u2013 include extending the limit on gun licence duration from five to 10 years and abolishing mandatory weapon removal for minor breaches of firearm storage laws. Shorten said that he was \u201cconcerned by reports on the eve of the recent Tasmanian state election that the Hodgman government had secretly committed to water down that state\u2019s gun laws\u201d. \u201cSimply put, the weakening of gun laws threatens the safety of our community,\u201d he said. \u201cI ask you to order an immediate review into the compliance of the Tasmanian government\u2019s proposal with the national firearms agreement. \u201cIf, as appears to be the case, that proposal would breach the agreement, I ask you to publicly demand that your Liberal party colleagues in the Tasmanian government abandon it.\u201d With record marches and civic activism calling for gun control in the United States, the federal Coalition government in Australia has been criticised for considering creating a \u201cfirearms advisory council\u201d, which the gun lobby says would give it \u201ca seat at the table\u201d for consultation. After his re-election in Tasmania Will Hodgman defended the Liberal government\u2019s controversial guns policy, arguing it would not breach the national firearms agreement and suggesting it might be changed before it is introduced to parliament. \u201cWe will engage with our colleagues on a national level to ensure there is no breach of the national firearms agreement,\u201d Hodgman said. \u201cIt will not happen.\u201d The prime minister\u2019s office referred a request for comment to the minister for law enforcement, Angus Taylor. Taylor said the Turnbull government \u201chas no intention to change the national firearms agreement\u201d and noted Hodgman had committed \u201cnot to do anything to compromise the agreement\u201d. \u201cShorten\u2019s letter is simply another political stunt from Labor,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Labor were serious about tough gun laws, they would have backed the Turnbull government\u2019s legislation to impose minimum mandatory sentences for illegal gun traffickers instead of voting them down.\u201d In other changes revealed in a 9 February letter to a firearm consultation group, the Tasmanian government said it would allow greater access to category C firearms \u2013 such as self-loading rifles and pump-action shotguns \u2013 for farm workers and sporting shooters. On Sunday the Liberal Democrat senator David Leyonhjelm told ABC24 the proposed changes were \u201cnot much of a weakening\u201d of gun laws. He cited a proposal that where farmers are already allowed to use certain types of firearms, the workers on those farms should be able to use the same weapons, saying it \u201cmakes an awful lot of sense\u201d. \u201cBill Shorten can huff and puff all he likes about it, at the end of the day if a state decides they don\u2019t want to cooperate with the national firearms agreement, that\u2019s up to them,\u201d Leyonhjelm said. The Liberal Democrat said he thought it was \u201cvery good politics\u201d for Hodgman to release the policy to firearms owners and licensees \u201cwho are prepared to vote on that issue\u201d. Those who \u201cwho jump up and down about gun laws being too weak and wanting more controls and so on\u201d don\u2019t vote on the issue, he claimed. Leyonhjelm \u2013 a recipient of donations from the gun lobby \u2013 said Shorten risked alienating 1 million gun owners who would see \u201cthis is a confected story that has nothing to do with safety\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
