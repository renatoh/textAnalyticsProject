It lacks a word processor. It doesn't have a spreadsheet. There is no camera. There is no calendar. It isn't a personal digital assistant (PDA). And there is even a health warning attached to its calculator, stating that it has \"limited accuracy\". Oh, it doesn't make phone calls, either. Its selling point is that it is an \"internet tablet\", one of the first of what may be a new generation of handhelds with instant access to the internet either through a wireless link - at home or in local hotspots such as Starbucks - or with a Bluetooth short-distance wireless link (which most smart phones have). As a fast link to the internet, it is the most impressive I have encountered on a mobile device. In standby mode it took 45 seconds to reach a bookmarked website using Wi-Fi broadband at home - including the time it took to establish the right wireless connection. Once that was done, it took only 10 to 15 seconds to move from one website to another. Using Google was a joy. The 770 has a big high-resolution screen for a mobile device (9cm by 4.5cm) and weighs 180g. You can input text either by using the stylus on a screen-based keyboard or using the handwriting recognition mode (there is no conventional keyboard). This is fine for finding sites or typing a quick reply to an email but pretty hopeless for anything much longer. I started writing this article using Google Mail (which, as with other email sites, can be accessed easily) but soon gave up. However, I wrote a short blog post without any trouble and was impressed by the way it handled my Flickr photographic account, doing everything a laptop would do. It gave speedy access to internet radio such as Shoutcast (with loud and clear volume) and to the online encyclopedia, Wikipedia. A button at the top gets rid of all the toolbars etc, enabling the website to occupy the whole screen. An adjacent button increases the size of the text if you have difficulty reading, and if this means that part of the picture is out of sight then the stylus will guide you around the screen. Other features include audio and video players, games such as chess, and a regularly refreshing news feed on the home screen. You can watch films if you have a big enough memory card. Although it can't be used as a phone, there are plans for a download to provide internet telephony soon. The more I used this device the more I was impressed with how well it did its limited functions. Once you accept it is a complementary product and not one that is going to replace everything else, then it assumes a life of its own. If you want something that is lying around the house, or by your bedside, for instant use when needed, then this is for you. It could come of age during an era of omnipresent Wi-Fi, enabling anytime, anywhere access to the web for everything from word processing to blogging and video sites. Previous attempts to sell internet tablet computers have failed despite massive accompanying hype. This one has two things in its favour. It is tailor-made for the cloudburst of web applications we are promised and, being based on open source, it can call on a volunteer army of Linux enthusiasts to write programs for it. Let's hope they start by making it easy to use online word processors such as Writely. On the downside, there is a price tag of $350 (just under \u00a3200). This is cheap if you regard yourself as buying a powerful, web-friendly computer, but a tad expensive as a luxury to leave around the house as an extra consumer durable. At a lower price it would be very tempting. vic.keegan@theguardian.com \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
