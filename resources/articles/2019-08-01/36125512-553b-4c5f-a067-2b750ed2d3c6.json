The Saracens prop has not been available to Eddie Jones since the Champions Cup final in mid-May but is now ready to resume national service. It has been a long, eventful slog for the loosehead who tore the tendon at the top of his hamstring so badly the muscle became detached from the bone. An operation was required and only now can he joke about how he was transported in a wheelchair across Los Angeles airport en route to Tonga where he was the best man at his brother Billy\u2019s wedding. \u201cA poor lady had to push me,\u201d said the 19st (122kg) Vunipola. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest airport I\u2019ve been to in my life and she was struggling a bit. I asked her: \u2018Are you OK?\u2019 I owe her a thank you for that.\u201d The 28-year-old also ended up having to spend two weeks in bed which, initially, was not a problem. \u201cFor me it was pretty much heaven. I was in bed constantly, apart from when I needed to go to the bathroom or the kitchen. I don\u2019t need much excuse to stay in bed.\u201d By the end of the fortnight, though, even a constant diet of television and his PlayStation was wearing thin. \u201cI needed to move and get the hamstring moving but I also felt very sloppy by the end of those two weeks. You get bigger and you lose muscle \u2013 not that, with me, you can really tell the difference.\u201d Precisely what he weighed at the most inactive point of his rehab remains a secret \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t want Eddie finding out\u201d \u2013 but weeks of subsequent hard work have left him at his lowest fighting weight since the tour of Australia in 2016. \u201cIn terms of body weight I\u2019m near enough the lightest I\u2019ve ever been. I feel good about that but match fitness is something different. We\u2019ll see how I go the weekend, if I get the chance. It\u2019s not Ireland I\u2019m excited about, it\u2019s being back playing. It\u2019s been tough the last four weeks, training by yourself and then watching.\u201d At his best a fully-fit Vunipola will be a key member of England\u2019s World Cup squad and he is vowing to make the most of his latest opportunity on the global stage, having seen his cousin, Wales\u2019s Taulupe Faletau, ruled out of the tournament through injury. \u201cToby has had some terrible luck and I\u2019m gutted for him. It reinforces the fact that any day could be your last, so you have to try to enjoy it as much as you can. \u201cAt the last World Cup I had only just started my international career. When you are that age you think you have loads more World Cups coming round. Now I\u2019m 28, with a few more injuries under my belt. As a team we have talked about not taking anything for granted. \u201cIf we want to do what we set out to do and win the World Cup, we need to use every day to get better. That is what we\u2019re trying to do. If I do get the opportunity to play this weekend, I\u2019ll be very excited to get a ball in my hand and do the thing I love.\u201d England should be able to welcome back the flankers Tom Curry and Sam Underhill at Twickenham but Exeter\u2019s Henry Slade and Jack Nowell and Bath\u2019s Ruaridh McConnochie are targeting the final warm-up game against Italy in Newcastle on 6 September. Northampton\u2019s Lewis Ludlam has also been given this week off because he has not yet had his full mandatory allocation of summer rest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
