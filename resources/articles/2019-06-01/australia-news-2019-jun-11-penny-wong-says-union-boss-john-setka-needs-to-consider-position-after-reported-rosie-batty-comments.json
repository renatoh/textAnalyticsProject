Speaking in Perth on Tuesday, Albanese revealed he had asked the party\u2019s national executive committee to suspend Setka immediately, and would move a motion to have him booted from the party at the next meeting of the ALP\u2019s administrative body. Setka, the Victorian secretary of the CFMMEU, has claimed he was \u201ctaken out of context\u201d after the Age reported he told a union meeting Batty\u2019s advocacy had led to men having fewer rights. On Tuesday, Setka said he had fallen victim to \u201cdirty ALP politics\u201d and that people were \u201cmaking up lies about what I said\u201d. Albanese said he had written to the national executive on Tuesday morning after speaking to Batty, who was made an officer of the Order of Australia as part of the Queen\u2019s Birthday honours list on Monday. \u201cMy concern here is that John Setka undermines the credibility of the trade union movement through the position that he holds and the public views that he has expressed,\u201d Albanese said. Setka told The New Daily on Tuesday he had the \u201cutmost respect for Rosie Batty\u201d. \u201cEvery time I see Rosie Batty I want to give her a hug,\u201d he said. \u201cI would rather be called corrupt. It\u2019s not even an exaggeration of what I said. It\u2019s an outright lie.\u201d He did concede he had said lawyers had told him laws had been skewed against men following the Victorian royal commission into family violence and Batty\u2019s campaigns. Sekta\u2019s comments came after a concerted push to have him stand down. \u201cIf any of these allegation[s] are correct, John Setka must resign,\u201d the ACTU secretary, SallyMcManus, said in a new statement on Tuesday. McManus did not address which allegations she was referring to but a spokesman said she was not addressing any matters before the courts. The ACTU secretary has been overseas for a labour conference but has now chosen to fly home early to deal with the unfolding crisis. Michelle O\u2019Neil, the ACTU president, added: \u201cWe will not tolerate violence against women in our movement, our leaders must demonstrate our values.\u201d The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, backed Albanese\u2019s actions on Tuesday afternoon, saying Setka\u2019s reported comments about Batty were \u201cdisgraceful and his refusal to apologise for them is appalling\u201d. The Victorian government also intends to dump Setka from a government board \u2013 the Building Industry Consultative Council. Albanese\u2019s comments come after Labor\u2019s Senate leader, Penny Wong, also declared herself on the side of Batty and called on Setka to consider his position. \u201cI want to say to Rosie Batty, I\u2019m on your side,\u201d Wong said. \u201cI thought his comments about Ms Batty were completely inappropriate. They are not in step with the values of the broader labour movement or the Labor party.\u201d On Tuesday the outgoing senator Doug Cameron called on Setka to resign. He said on Twitter he strongly supported the CFMMEU, but Setka should \u201cput the movement and members first by resigning\u201d. Batty, whose son Luke was killed by her estranged husband in 2014, told the ABC on Monday that Setka\u2019s remarks were \u201cludicrous\u201d and an example of \u201csomebody whose leadership role really needs to be challenged\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m quite astonished with those comments,\u201d said Batty, who was on Monday appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia for her advocacy. \u201cRather than feel, you know, men have less rights, we have so much more to gain by recognising that moving forward we\u2019re [moving to] a place of equality.\u201d Last month Setka also told a Victorian court he would plead guilty to charges of harassing a woman. Setka\u2019s role as state secretary is elected, meaning it would be hard to remove him unless he stood down. Sources close to the ACTU said that internal discussions around Setka\u2019s future began some time ago. They said the ACTU would argue it would not be appropriate for Setka to remain in his role if a harassment conviction was recorded. The CFMMEU has been approached for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
