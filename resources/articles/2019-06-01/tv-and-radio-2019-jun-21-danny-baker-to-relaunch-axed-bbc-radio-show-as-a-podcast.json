The DJ, 61, who was sacked by the broadcaster in May over accusations of racism, said on Twitter that the podcast would be released twice-weekly and feature the same elements as his previous show. \u201cMy own standalone podcast, featuring all the old firm and even the Sausage Sandwich Game, will begin in the new year. Emails encouraged, calls taken, subjects bizarre. A twice-a-week meeting, we can rule the world,\u201d he wrote. Baker\u2019s departure from the BBC came in the wake of a tweet in which he depicted the newborn son of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, whose mother is African-American, as a chimpanzee. Following widespread criticism, Baker deleted the tweet and said that he hadn\u2019t recognised the racial connotations of the tweet because his mind was not \u201cdiseased\u201d. The BBC cancelled Baker\u2019s show soon after, with a Radio 5 Live spokesperson describing the tweet as going against \u201cthe values we as a station aim to embody\u201d. The tweet was subsequently investigated by the Metropolitan police, which declined to take further action. Baker later issued a formal apology for the tweet, describing it as a \u201cnaive and catastrophic mistake\u201d. Writing on Twitter, Baker said that he had altered his social-media habits in the wake of the controversy. \u201cI only nip in [to Twitter] for half an hour a night now. Learned my lesson,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
