Mr Snow will replace Paul O'Neill, who Mr Bush sacked on Friday. The president also fired Larry Lindsey, the White House economic adviser, as part of a shake-up designed to control political damage from the ailing economy. Mr Snow, 63, currently serves as chairman, president and chief executive of CSX Corp, a transportation conglomerate based in Richmond, Virginia. The company runs the largest rail freight network in the eastern United States. \"I appreciate John's willingness to serve his country,\" Mr Bush said today. \"He has led one of our nation's largest railroads with skill and success.\" In an oblique reference to the continuing fallout from financial scandals such as those at Enron and WorldCom, Mr Bush added: \"John has a deep, long-standing commitment to ethical corporate governance.\" Mr Snow's total direct compensation in 2001 was $20.5m (\u00a313.6m), according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. CSX posted $8.1bn in revenue last year. Mr Bush intends to replace Mr Lindsey with Stephen Friedman, a former co-chairman of the investment firm Goldman Sachs, White House officials said. The president hopes that the new team will do better than Mr O'Neill and Mr Lindsey at communicating administration economic policies to Congress and the public, officials said. Mr Snow was deputy undersecretary at the transportation department under former president Gerald Ford. The vice-president, Dick Cheney, who brought Mr O'Neill into the administration and then led the selection process for his successor, also served Mr Ford as chief of staff. The Senate still must confirm Mr Snow's nomination. Mr Snow's first task will be to help build support for a major economic package Mr Bush plans to introduce later this month or in early January. The White House has been at work for months on a new economic package centred on additional tax cuts for lower and middle-income individuals, playing down the administration's earlier focus on business-side tax proposals to stimulate investment. Mr Bush said today that the economy still faced \"challenges\" to growth, and said his administration would put forward policies to tackle persistent unemployment, the tax burden, consumer debt and a lack of investor confidence. After November's mid-term elections, Mr Snow told the Wall Street Journal: \"I do feel more confident that the economy will come up quicker, as opposed to having Democrats take control.\" Democrats on Sunday seized on the shake-up as evidence that Bush's economic agenda is in distress. Former vice-president Al Gore, who may seek the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination and a rematch against Bush, said on ABC television that Mr O'Neill and Mr Lindsey are \"fall guys for failed policies\". Democratic senator Joseph Lieberman, Mr Gore's running mate in 2000, said the shake-up would mean little without changes in economic policy. \"The economy needs something different from what President Bush has given it,\" he told Fox television."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
