By switching off at half-time after a Martin Grainger free-kick and Tommy Mooney's penalty had established a 2-0 lead, City sold the spectators short. \"Our display in the second half was a disappointment,\" said Trevor Francis, the City manager. \"I'm reluctant to be critical because it was very hot and our second game in three days. But our mental attitude was not as good as it should have been. We should have gone into the second half looking to finish things off.\" Fortunately for them Stockport's first effort on target came three minutes from time when Shefki Kuqi pulled a goal back from the penalty spot after being fouled by Michael Johnson. But for the County manger Andy Kilner that goal should have been the winner. For him the difference between winning and a fourth successive league defeat was down to one man: the referee Rob Styles. \"I hate to say it but I feel two completely mystifying decisions in the first 21 minutes cost us the game. Why the free-kick was given, I'll never know. And why the penalty was awarded, only he knows. \"Unfortunately for me we had this referee at Wolves a couple of years ago. He cost us the game there and me the best part of the week's wages in fines after I said what I thought of him. This time he made his intentions clear early on and it was obviously a struggle, especially against a side like Birmingham.\" Whatever the rights and wrongs of those decisions, one side dominated in the first half and it was not County. Grainger, making amends for being sent off at Walsall on Saturday, struck with his early free-kick and almost repeated his success with another in the 11th minute. Again taken from just outside the penalty area in the inside-right channel, this time Stockport's goalkeeper Lee Jones palmed the ball to safety instead of it curling into the top right-hand corner. Geoff Horsfield then twice went close following incisive City manoeuvres but Mooney's satisfaction at scoring his fourth goal in five games, when he converted the penalty after Scott Taylor had bundled over Stan Lazaridis, was short-lived. The striker was taken off on a stretcher in the 61st minute after falling awkwardly, and Francis fears the worst. \"He's gone to have his injured ankle x-rayed. I don't like the sound of it because he said to our physio he heard a crack when he landed.\" Birmingham (4-4-2): Kelly; Gill (Sonner, 63min), Purse, M Johnson, Grainger; Eaden, Hughes, O'Connor, Lazaridis; Horsfield (Furlong, 76), Mooney (A Johnson, 60).
