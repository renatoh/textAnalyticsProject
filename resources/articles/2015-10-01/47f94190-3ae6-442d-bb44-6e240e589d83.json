It arrived at the fourth attempt as Nathaniel Clyne\u2019s early goal earned the eight-times winners a place in the quarter-finals of the Capital One Cup at the expense of Bournemouth. \u201cIt feels much better than a draw,\u201d the relieved Liverpool manager admitted. Southampton await in the last eight and, though Liverpool suffered another nervous finale having struggled to put the tie beyond Eddie Howe\u2019s team, there was further encouragement for their new manager. The stand-in goalkeeper, Adam Bogdan, produced a commanding display to thwart Junior Stanislas throughout the first half and Matt Ritchie at the death. Roberto Firmino had his finest game since arriving at the club for \u00a329m from Hoffenheim while Klopp\u2019s willingness to give youth a chance \u2013 with Jo\u00e3o Teixeira, Connor Randall and Cameron Brannagan handed full debuts \u2013 paid dividends. There were hugs all round on the final whistle as Klopp celebrated his maiden Liverpool victory with every member of his backroom team, his substitutes and a few supporters near the dugout. It was a scoreline rather than a performance to savour, and a release after beginning his Anfield reign with three consecutive draws. Klopp said: \u201cI didn\u2019t think the other games were so much worse than tonight but, of course, the result makes the biggest difference. We only had one hour\u2019s training with this new team and a new system but we got better minute by minute; we closed the spaces better and we also played football for the whole 90 minutes.\u201d Anfield, evacuated on Tuesday when a man was reported missing while on a stadium tour, witnessed decent debuts from the three youngsters and calm guidance from the experienced heads around them. Changes were necessary due to injuries and Saturday\u2019s trip to Chelsea \u2013 when Klopp expects Christian Benteke to have recovered from a slight knee problem \u2013 but also a reward for young talents who have impressed the German coach in training. \u201cIt was clear to me that the first chance I could give them I would do it,\u201d said Klopp. Teixeira, an attacking midfielder from Sporting Lisbon, exuded confidence and played an audacious part in the decisive goal, the product of a fine, flowing Liverpool move that left Klopp jabbing the air in delight. Divock Origi received several furious rollickings from his manager in the first half but showed the workrate and movement demanded with a surging run down the right. The Belgium international squared inside to Firmino, the Brazilian released Teixeira behind the Bournemouth defence and with only Adam Federici to beat but running away from goal, the 20-year-old beat the keeper with an impudent back heel. A debut goal to remember beckoned until Adam Smith scrambled the ball off the line, only for Clyne to convert the rebound. Bournemouth were highly unfortunate to fall behind. But for Bogdan\u2019s one-man crusade against Stanislas in the first half the visitors would have established a commanding advantage. Three times Stanislas tested the Hungarian goalkeeper before the interval. Three times he was denied. The impact of costly injuries and shipping ten goals in their previous two league outings did not show in the visitors\u2019 approach. Howe\u2019s team were close to an early lead when the lone striker Yann Kermorgant dispossessed Joe Allen. The fit-again, combative Harry Arter released Stanislas down the left and the midfielder had only Bogdan to beat when he cut inside the recalled Dejan Lovren. Simon Mignolet\u2019s deputy flew off his line to smother the shot. He also tipped over a Stanislas header at close range and clawed away the former Burnley player\u2019s attempt to beat him with a powerful free-kick angled towards the near post. Aside from the goal, Liverpool\u2019s brightest moments of the first half were two Firmino shots from distance that Federici saved well. Klopp said in his programme notes that it was the team\u2019s responsibility to enthuse the crowd, not vice-versa, and a subdued Anfield atmosphere reflected the fare on display. Gradually, however, the noise increased in tandem with Liverpool\u2019s performance level. Firmino was at the heart of the home team\u2019s improvement, not only with a creative touch that maintained pressure on the Bournemouth goal but his willingness to press and challenge every opponent. One successful interception should have resulted in Liverpool edging into the comfort zone but having taken the ball off the toes of Marc Pugh and surged clear into the area, he dragged his shot wide of the Kop goal. Shaun MacDonald headed wide from a Stanislas corner but otherwise, and despite the disruption caused when Kolo Tour\u00e9 departed early with a hamstring injury, Liverpool\u2019s defence was rarely stretched in the second half until the closing minutes. Randall merited credit for his part in the clean sheet. After a difficult opening, when Bournemouth doubled up on the often unprotected full-back, the defender recovered impressively to stifle the visitors and keep them pegged back with several determined runs down the right. Federici saved well from a Teixeira free-kick and a powerful half-volley from the substitute Lucas Leiva but despite yet again offering opponents a way back, Liverpool this time held firm. Klopp is off the mark."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
