The London 2012 chairman, Seb Coe, a Chelsea fan, said yesterday that he would consider asking Mourinho to play a part in the promotion of the Games despite the manager's sudden departure from Stamford Bridge on Wednesday. Chelsea were among the first clubs to lend their support to London's bid and Lord Coe, a Stamford Bridge regular, has discussed his plans for the Games at length with Mourinho. The Portuguese said at the launch of London's controversial logo that he would be keen to remain involved in the Games even if he was not working in England come 2012. \"When we come to look at our ambassadorial programme, he [Mourinho] would be obvious, given that he has been with us throughout this project,\" Coe said. London's lack of charismatic ambassadors was underlined at the launch of its sponsorship deal with Adidas yesterday. With Christine Ohuruogu off limits there are few genuine British medal hopes, forcing Adidas to rely on a hologram message from David Beckham and the presence of the American athletes Tyson Gay and Allyson Felix for star quality. Blue revolution fails to follow blueprint Jose Mourinho's departure from Chelsea utterly undermined a PR offensive for the launch of Blue Revolution, a self-indulgent documentary charting the Roman Abramovich years, on Wednesday night. In the film the chief executive, Peter Kenyon, outlines the club's grandiose ambitions, but questions may now be asked about Kenyon's role in the crisis enveloping Stamford Bridge. Presumably Champions League gates below 25,000 and the sudden promotion of a coach who would be fortunate to get a job in the Championship on the basis of his CV are not part of his break-even blueprint. Kenyon has a working relationship with Avram Grant, however, and they travelled together to the Champions League draw in Monaco last month. Meanwhile, as the club tried to regain the initiative by publishing an \"open letter\" to fans that laughably claimed Mourinho had neither resigned nor been sacked, a scheduled appearance by Shaun Wright-Phillips at the Chelsea megastore was hastily cancelled. Day of mixed emotions for long-serving Clarke Chelsea's assistant manager, Steve Clarke, had a momentous day. After confirmation that Mourinho had left the club he took training alongside his new boss, Grant, watched by the owner, Abramovich, before travelling to the funeral of the former Chelsea manager Ian Porterfield in Surrey. Clarke played under Porterfield during the latter's two-year spell in charge of the club in the early 1990s. Olympic deal looks a bargain for Adidas Adidas trumpeted its sponsorship of London 2012 as a \u00a3100m deal but the company will earn back much of its investment via merchandising. The deal includes a licensing agreement by which the sportswear firm will pay 2012 a royalty fee for all merchandising sold but keep the mark-up on the goods. Insiders say London will receive about \u00a370m in cash, value-in-kind services and merchandising revenue, but there are precious few details available of how the remaining \u00a330m, earmarked for schemes designed to boost participation among young people, will be spent. McLaren fallout hits mechanics in pocket The disquiet in the McLaren team has spread from the drivers to the mechanics, who are said to be close to revolt after it emerged that they may be left out of pocket by the team's FIA punishment. They are on a bonus scheme linked to constructors' championship points but, with McLaren stripped of all those points, they stand to lose \u00a34,000 each. Ron Dennis is thought to be considering making up the shortfall to head off further dissatisfaction as the season enters its final weeks. Panel membership boost for Ohuruogu Christine Ohuruogu's appeal against her life ban from the Olympics will be heard by the same officials who cleared the triathlete Tim Don to appear in the Beijing Olympics. The news that Nicholas Stewart QC will chair the panel, and be joined by the BOA board members who heard Don's appeal, is a boon to Ohuruogu, who is hopeful that the triathlete's case has set a precedent. Like Ohuruogu, Don was banned after missing three drugs tests but he successfully appealed against the BOA ban on the ground that he was confused by UK Sport's new whereabouts system."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
