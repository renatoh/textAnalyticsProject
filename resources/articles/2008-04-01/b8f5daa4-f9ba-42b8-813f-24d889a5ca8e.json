The Chancellor, Alistair Darling, will use Tuesday's meeting with major banks and building societies to insist they pass on recent interest rate cuts to their customers. But he is also expected to discuss ways to help people at risk of defaulting, including putting those with previously good credit records on 'flexible' mortgage schemes - which allow a few months' breathing space from payments, to be made up in the future - or even deals allowing distressed homeowners to sell up to the lender but stay on as rent-paying tenants. This week the Bank of England is expected to unveil the details of a plan to inject \u00a350bn into the mortgage market, by swapping packages of mortgage debt for more secure government-backed bonds. But Darling will make clear he expects the benefit to be passed to customers through cheaper mortgage rates and more help for those in trouble. 'It's about saying firstly that they have got to be in a position to pass on the rate cuts, plus having a discussion about what to do about people who are in danger of defaulting on their mortgage payments,' said a Whitehall source. 'For example, putting people on flexible mortgages, so that they aren't being put into a position where they get into bad debt because they can't make their payments.' Flexible mortgages allow customers to underpay for a few months and then make bigger compensating payments later if circumstances have improved. Many lenders also offer 'mortgage holidays' to customers in specific circumstances, such as couples who have just had a baby, which could be extended. Ministers say they are prepared to listen to ideas from industry, but the government is already studying so-called 'rentback' schemes now operated by private companies which offer to buy houses from struggling owners, and then rent the same house back to them as tenants. Housing charities argue some are exploiting desperate families by buying houses at less than two-thirds of their market value and ministers, together with the Financial Services Authority, were already looking at tighter regulation. One option is encouraging more lenders to offer their own shared-ownership schemes to good customers struggling to meet payments, where the bank would effectively buy the house and the former owner would stay on as the bank's tenant, paying rent. Yvette Cooper, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, and housing minister Caroline Flint, will also attend the meeting which follows criticism from Labour MPs, first revealed in The Observer this month, that the government was not doing enough for homeowners at risk. Up to two million customers due to come off cheap fixed-rate deals this year face remortgaging just as lenders are scrapping such offers and house prices are falling. Lenders are expected to propose increased state support for those who lose their jobs and then default on payments. Currently homeowners are only entitled to state help with the mortgage once they have been out of work for nine months - by which time some may have lost their homes. Stephen Timms, the welfare minister, is to meet the Council of Mortgage Lenders tomorrow. A source at the Department for Work and Pensions said ministers understood the pressures on homeowners and were ready to listen to lenders but added: 'It is a balance between what it costs the state to do this versus making life easier for individuals. There is obviously not a lot of spare capacity (in the welfare budget).' Repossessions last year averaged 80 a day, expected to rise to 125 a day by the end of the year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
