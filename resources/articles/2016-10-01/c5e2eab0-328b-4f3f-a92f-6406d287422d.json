What does this twist mean? Eyes grew wider when it emerged that the new emails had come to light through an unrelated FBI investigation of Anthony Weiner, the husband (separated) of top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Weiner is under investigation for allegedly sexting with a 15-year-old. Read full news coverage Trump said the news had made him rethink his assessment of everything inside and outside government being \u201crigged.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very proud that the FBI was willing to do this, actually,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election,\u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign chair John Podesta said in a statement demanding more information. The political repercussions, if any, were unclear. Vice-president Joe Biden tamped down speculation that he might serve as secretary of state in a Clinton administration. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything I can if Hillary\u2019s elected to help her,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want to remain in the administration.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
