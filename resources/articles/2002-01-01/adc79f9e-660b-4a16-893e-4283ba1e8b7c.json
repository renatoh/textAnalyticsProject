But the obstacles are unlikely to get in the way of his hurdler Majlis in today's feature race at the Sunbury track, the Lanzarote Hurdle. The application of blinkers has seen Majlis come good on his last two starts - he wore the headgear regularly on the Flat in Ireland - and the five-year-old can complete the hat-trick off a useful looking mark. When runner-up to Pedro Pete here last season, Majlis (3.05) finished ahead of Tikram, who declines to re-oppose on 10lb worse terms. Gary Moore relies on Rob Leach instead, but bigger dan gers are probably Pagan King, for whom the sharp track is ideal, and top-weight Tysou. Haydock 1.30: Historic has been a fine advert for the training skills of George and the front-runner should go well here. But the step up in trip can see Jair Du Cochet back in business. The French raider was vastly superior to his former stable-mate Janus Du Cochet, who got within a length and a half of It Takes Time at Cheltenham. Kempton 1.35: Londoner, ante-post favourite for the Triumph Hurdle, is likely to be all the rage here. With the benefit of experience, easy Wetherby winner Rigmarole might prove better value. Catterick 1.45: Ichi Beau, who has developed into a useful two-mile chaser, could be hard to beat off this much lower hurdles mark. His stable is not in the best of form, though, and preference is for Dushaan who goes well for promising rider Tom Phelan. Haydock 2.00: A 19lb rise in the weights has made things harder for morning line favourite Banker Count. At three times the price, Red Striker appeals. Breathing problems have hindered Red Striker's progress, but he is useful on his day and was travelling ominously well when blundering badly five out in Behrajan's race at Wetherby. Kempton 2.05: Oliver Cromwell goes well here and will strip fitter than when chasing home Cupboard Lover last month. He is the one for the forecast with Gumley Gale , who is on the upgrade judging by his latest Ascot run. Wincanton 2.15: Provided his legs stand up to this comeback run, Gold Cup winner Looks Like Trouble should be far too good for these. Haydock 2.30: Beaten by Valiramix and Landing Light on his last two starts, The French Furze can lead all the way to hold off Rodock. Kempton 2.35: The One Man colours should be to the fore with Heros Collonges , who is owned by John Hales. He is rated Cheltenham material by his shrewd trainer. Catterick 3.25: Reverting to fences here last time, Lurpak Legend ran well to finish fourth behind Sharpastrizam. A similar effort should suffice. Kempton 3.40: Super Tactics should make a bold bid to win the race named in his honour. The course specialist is closely handicapped with King On The Run on their form here last season, but the latter goes particularly well when fresh and his stable is in flying form."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
