The prime minister spoke to reporters barely an hour after his office had formally received its copy of Lord Butler's inquiry. Aides were quick to say that Mr Blair was not shifting the goalposts away from the divisive issue of weapons of mass destruction. He will make what is likely to be an hour-long Commons statement with questions at 1.30 pm, after Lord Butler's press conference on the findings of his committee. Exactly how Lord Butler will apportion blame, and whom he puts in the spotlight, is still uncertain. Mr Blair and close aides like Jonathan Powell, his chief of staff, are likely to feel some heat. John Scarlett, the former chairman of the joint intelligence committee, who was responsible for signing off the September 2002 dossier which wrongly alleged that Saddam Hussein was capable of deploying weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes, came under early pressure from a different source yesterday when Labour backbenchers tabled a parliamentary motion calling for his removal as head of MI6. Mr Blair caused controversy in May by giving Mr Scarlett the top MI6 job. Labour leftwingers Jeremy Corbyn and Alice Mahon yesterday tabled an early-day motion calling for Mr Scarlett to be removed from his new post. Mr Corbyn later said: \"Since the inquiry is going on into the effectiveness or other wise of the intelligence service and he is part of the subject matter of the inquiry, it seems very strange that he should be promoted in the middle of the inquiry.\" Lord Butler will focus on the extent to which MI6, under Sir Richard Dearlove, allowed itself to be influenced by the government's political imperatives as it prepared for military action against Iraq. Sources familiar with the report say it does not \"damn\" any particular individual. Asked whether he expected to be damaged by the report, Mr Blair replied: \"I feel very much as I did 18 months ago. I think it is very difficult to look at Iraq today, to look at Iraq under Saddam, and say we would be better off, the world would be safer, we would be more secure, if Saddam was still in charge of Iraq.\" In a byelection speech in Leicester South, Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the issue was one of \"trust and judgment\". Mr Kennedy (who, with Michael Howard, began reading the report behind closed doors at 6am today) argued that \"the only mandate this government had for the war was winning a [Commons] vote where military force was specifically sanctioned to remove the elusive WMDs. Lord Butler's terms of reference include investigating \"the accuracy of intelligence on Iraqi WMD ... and to examine any discrepancies between the intelligence gathered, evaluated and used by the government before the conflict, and between that intelligence and what has been discovered by the Iraq Survey Group since the end of the conflict\". The survey group has found no WMD in Iraq. G2 cover story Jonathan Freedland, page 19"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
