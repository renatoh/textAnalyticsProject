Pink cards are sent depicting storks carrying bundles, in-laws arrive bearing bouquets of flowers, work-mates ring and say they would never have guessed. But not in the Danvers-Smith household. \"I was devastated,\" said Natasha, one of Britain's foremost 400m hurdlers. Such a reaction will not have made her many friends at the antenatal clinic. But among her fellow Olympic hopefuls it must have seemed a perfectly understandable reaction. It has scuppered her chances of going to Athens this summer. Danvers-Smith, 26, who is married to her coach Darrell, said: \"I went into a depression stage. I had dreams of what I wanted to do this year. \"Wanting to achieve my goals was the whole wide world for me. I could medal at the Olympics. I would have money, recognition - something I have been aiming at for years. \"Financially, it will be really, really hard. This year was going to be an investment in my future - our future. Now, instead of making an income, I'm going to be incurring a cost.\" All had seemed plain sailing until she ran in the first race of her summer build-up. Worried that her body \"didn't feel right\" she booked a date with her doctor and was told: \"You're pregnant, Mrs Smith.\" \"I was the main bread- winner in the family because it's hard for coaches to get rewards in athletics,\" she said. \"At the same time, I would have lost my soul if I had made the decision not to have this child. It would not have fitted at all well with my heart. \"But I will come out on the other side. There will be another Olympics. I am really happy and hoping that everything is fine with the baby. It could have been another year but, because I've made what I think constitutes a sacrifice, this child will be very special.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
