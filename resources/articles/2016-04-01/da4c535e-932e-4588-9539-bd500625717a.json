When crossing Deptford youths might stop a stranger and ask them to show their ankles. If they are not wearing two pairs of socks, it will confirm they are not local. \u201cIn that case, they\u2019ll punch you in the face and tell you to fuck off or they might take your phone, not to use it, but because they can \u2013 for power,\u201d said Michael Harris, 22, who runs a boxing club in the centre of New Cross, Lewisham. Not everyone is subject to the two-sock rule. Only individuals who are black, male and below the age of 20 are liable to be confronted. Numerous diktats and codes govern the streets of New Cross and the behaviour of its young people, but the main driver of violence on the streets of south-east London remains the postcode. In this district of the capital, where deprivation levels are among the highest in the country, Lewisham (SE13) and New Cross (SE14) are known locally as \u201cthe ghetto\u201d. Peckham (SE15) is dubbed \u201cPecknam\u201d after the Vietnam war. Woven into the postcode rivalry are themes of respect and retribution, with hostilities \u2013 according to Harris \u2013 often inherited from fathers and uncles. But the overriding issue is the widespread carrying of knives. The streets of Lewisham, where the murder rate is twice the national average, have been classified as the \u201cleast peaceful\u201d in England and Wales in an index by the Institute for Economics and Peace. Last weekend the streets registered their latest victim, 17-year-old upcoming rapper Myron Yarde, who was fatally stabbed during an altercation involving at least 10 male youths. Harris runs the Double Jab Boxing Club in New Cross, where Myron, known as MDot, regularly worked out in the weights room over the past two years, and where his \u201cgodbrother\u201d, Courtney Bennett, 20, fought his way from an uncompromising background to become a champion boxer. The Double Jab lies 250 metres from the backstreet where Myron was found by police on Sunday, lying in a pool of blood. He had been stabbed in the leg, the knife severing an artery. A 15-year-old boy appeared at Bromley Youth Court, south London on Saturday charged with Myron\u2019s murder. The defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, rose only to give his name, age and address. Immediately outside the Double Jab\u2019s imposing metal door lies Fordham Park, a recently renovated urban space close to the SE14 and SE13 border from where stabbings and shootings are frequently reported to Harris. His father Patrick, 52, who founded Double Jab four years ago, is concerned the area is becoming desensitised to the violence. Half the initial intake had either been in prison or shot. \u201cWe\u2019ve had gunfights outside the door, knife attacks in the park. It\u2019s terrible out there. New Cross is becoming a war zone, the things that happen at night, the things you don\u2019t see,\u201d Patrick said. He estimates up to 80% of New Cross residents aged between 12 and 18 have been threatened with a knife. Almost next door to the club is Deptford Green secondary school, where Myron studied, and where many of its 1,100 pupils are considered fair game by those from rival schools \u2013 another sub-category of attacker and victim. According to Michael Harris, Deptford Green pupils have a long-standing rivalry with those attending Addey and Stanhope across New Cross Road and the two Peckham academies, Walworth and Harris. Patrick said the club occasionally served as a \u201csanctuary\u201d to teenagers fleeing violence. Michael added: \u201cWe had three kids from the school running in here screaming, \u2018They\u2019ve taken my phone and pulled a knife on me.\u2019 Then we had a girl from Deptford Green who was beaten up across the park and ran in here. They come for protection.\u201d Michael Harris said that, to understand the psychology of New Cross, it is essential to accept that many of its teenagers feel genuinely terrified on its streets. \u201cThey carry knives because they think they are in danger. Half of them don\u2019t want to fight; they carry them because they feel insecure and don\u2019t want to be considered a target.\u201d Harris, from the Aylesbury estate in Walworth, added: \u201cIf you don\u2019t lash out, someone will lash out at you, so they lash out to prove they are not a target. If they don\u2019t, they might get \u2018rolled up\u2019 and so they overreact and someone ends up dying.\u201d Four teenagers have been arrested over Myron\u2019s death: two 15-year-olds and two 16-year-olds. Marnie Swindells, 21, who coaches at the Double Jab in between training to be a barrister, said: \u201cThe kids around here live in fear \u2013 fear of getting robbed, bullied, picked on or beaten up. They are scared, so they carry a knife.\u201d Harris recounts conversations with some of the club\u2019s 150 members, including one who \u2013 with knife-carrying being so routine \u2013 mentioned in a matter-of-fact way that he had stabbed three people. At least another two, he added, had been involved in shootings, with a further dozen recounting knife-related incidents, including stabbings or threats. In one month last year, 10 people were stabbed, including one fatality, in Lewisham and Greenwich, although many incidents are not reported. Last month the Metropolitan police recorded 676 violent crimes in Lewisham, including a man stabbed in his home in New Cross Road. In New Cross in January, Scotland Yard recorded 60 violent incidents. The area\u2019s reputation can intimidate the young offenders who are sometimes sent to Double Jab to learn discipline and a positive way of channelling aggression. \u201cSome will actually be scared of coming here, scared of being knifed. Sometimes I have to meet them off the bus and walk them to the club,\u201d said Harris. \u201cEven if you are not in a gang, you will be attacked because you are from [another] area. You will know gang members because you grew up with them at school or they lived nearby. You are attacked because they think you might be [in a gang].\u201d Myron was not a member of any gang and was considered kind, funny and decent by his peers. Those who work with the teenagers of New Cross have little faith in attempts by the authorities to break up long-standing gang structures. Harris believes the police often fail to grasp the nuances of gang culture, underestimating its role in providing opportunity, solidarity and income in an area defined by deprivation, an anti-education culture and where a quarter of young people live in families claiming tax credits. \u201cThe police are fighting a losing battle. Gangs don\u2019t work like an organisation,\u201d he said. \u201cGang leaders become father figures, mentors and teachers who can provide an income, solidarity and security in an unsafe area. They teach them how to make money and they keep them safe. \u201cYou have children with no job, no means of making money and then they are asked if they can store some stuff at their house and get paid \u00a35,000 for that.\u201d The team at Double Jab witness many teenagers who consider themselves on the scrapheap before they have even finished school. \u201cOne problem is that they get labelled as a problem early on and this always leads to them becoming a bigger problem,\u201d said Patrick. Michael Harris added that many felt categorised as \u201cwasters\u201d by teachers and quickly stopped trying to achieve at school before drifting into criminality as a means of ensuring safety in an unsafe area. Many had never even tried getting a job, mainly because they never expected to get one. \u201cThey think they\u2019ll never get a job. They have no CV or anything because they think they\u2019ll just get rejected,\u201d said Harris. Myron was considered one of Deptford\u2019s bright hopes, an inspiration among his friends and peers with his musicianship and rapping prompting predictions of fame. His popularity was demonstrated by the instant success of a fundraising page to pay for the his funeral \u2013 his mother, Marcelle, died of cancer last year. It rapidly raised twice the \u00a37,000 target. Among the many tributes is one from fellow south London rapper Giggs, who suggests that a new New Cross generation believes there is a future beyond the turf wars and knives. In an Instagram post, Giggs wrote: \u201cThere\u2019s loads of opportunity out there for us street dudes now \u2013 music, working a camera, being a comedian. These are things we never knew we had access to before, so now that we know we can make big things happen and we\u2019ve got options.\u201d A sense of being able to escape criminality is also becoming evident among the Double Jab regulars. When the manager at a local William Hill branch asked Harris to push forward some candidates for a job, with the promise that he would ignore criminal records, the results were spectacular. Of 14 individuals, nine are currently working full-time. \u201cIt just shows what you can do if you give people belief and an opportunity,\u201d Harris said. Myron has gone, but in this toughest of neighbourhoods, people like Michael Harris are determined that his legacy of pursuing a dream lives on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
