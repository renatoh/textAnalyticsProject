I sat alone with my mum in her old Ford Escort, in the empty car park of the local Co-op. \"What, gaylords, like at school? It's ... where two men sleep in the same bed and kiss each other,\" I replied. \"That's kind of right. But it's more like ... well, you know how usually a man loves a woman, and a woman loves a man? Well gay is where, instead of loving a woman, a man loves a man. Or a woman, instead of loving a man, loves another woman.\" A pause. \"It's exactly the same as a relationship between a man and a woman, but between either two men, or two women. There is no difference apart from that.\" Another pause. \"You may have heard a woman who loves another woman being called a lesbian, but I don't like that word. Gay is a nicer word to use; the right word to use.\" My mum dropped her head slightly. With her eyes to the floor she drew a sad smile. I had seen the expression only once before, when my dad told me about the divorce. \"Shaun, there's something I need to tell you. I'm gay.\" I was confused. I tried desperately to grasp what I had been told. I didn't understand. \"Don't worry, Mum. I still love you.\" She turned and reached for me over the gear-stick. \"I love you too and I'm still the same. I love you more than anything. I'm still exactly the same.\" She began to let go but before I unwrapped my arms from around her neck I whispered into her ear. \"And don't worry, Mum, I promise I won't tell anyone.\" My name is Shaun Noble and my mum is a lesbian. I have one sister, who is three years younger than me. A dad, who I have not lived with since I was seven. And two stepmums, one my dad's partner and the other my mum's. But to most people I know - my uncles, aunties and cousins, my friends, team-mates and colleagues, and to new people I meet - my parents are separated. My dad has remarried, my mum is single and we rent a large double bedroom to a female lodger called Jane, whom my mum met through work. In short, it's complicated. Having a gay mother is unusual. A few flag-fliers in the gay community champion gay parents as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Children raised by gay parents, they say, will not be negatively affected in any way. I do not agree. Some anti-gay protesters, on the other hand, almost put gay parents with the paedophiles and child abusers. They argue that children of gay parents lack adequate role models, will be socially inept and, worst of all, will be gay themselves. Needless to say, I don't agree with them either. At 10, the concerns of a boy switching from junior to secondary school are the bullies. In terms of bullying potential (and they were the only terms that mattered), I knew having a gay mum was the kind of thing that got you outcast and bogwashed in big school. I was lucky, I remember thinking. I only had a gay mum. I wasn't fat, I didn't have ginger hair or spots, braces or glasses. So why tell anyone about Mum? Why volunteer to be the bullied outcast? To keep \"the secret\" was my natural disposition from the moment she told me. But it was not easy. I didn't talk to anyone about Mum. I was too scared of their reaction, too shy and perhaps too ashamed. I didn't invite friends to my house because I was terrified they might uncover the truth. But ultimately my mum's sexuality is as much a part of me as it is of her, and on some days that part wants out. On some days, like the day I decided to write this, or the day Mum pulled into the Co-op car park, it's not enough to keep the secret or avoid the truth. It's on those days that I want to stand in front of the world and shout, \"My mum is a lesbian!\" It was Christmas of year 11 before I told someone. I was 15 and had nearly had sex for the first time. I was in bed with my girlfriend, Sarah. After another evening of fumbling and \"shall-we-shan't-we\", we decided to tell each other all our secrets. \"You go first,\" Sarah said. \"No, you.\" \"No, I don't want to. You go.\" \"OK, I'll go,\" I said. The sick, nervous ache I felt while trying to put a condom on 25 minutes earlier returned to my stomach. \"Are you OK?\" Sarah asked. \"Yeah, I'm just nervous.\" \"Please tell me.\" \"I want to tell you, I just don't want to say it.\" I couldn't say it. \"Have you got a pen and paper?\" \"Yeah, on my desk.\" I sat at the desk and wrote it. In blue ink, on the first line of an A4 piece of paper, I wrote what I had never written or spoken before: \"My mum is gay.\" Scared now, I ripped the paper from the pad. I folded it in half and in half again. I opened the desk's bottom drawer and grabbed a small pink envelope. As if it were where it belonged, I sealed my secret inside. \"I'm going to give you this but I don't want you to read it while I'm here,\" I said. \"OK.\" \"I'm going outside and I'll post it through the letterbox. I want you to look out your window and not come down until I've gone.\" I got dressed. I took my keys and wallet and walked out of the room. I ran down the stairs, took my coat from the hook and left. I switched on my bike's silver front and red rear lights and walked it to the front door. I looked up for Sarah in her bedroom window and gave a sad smile. I took the small pink envelope from my pocket and pushed it through the letterbox. I cycled home and left her with my secret. On that night I overcame the greatest milestone of my adolescence. Three weeks later, I lost my virginity. I am no longer running down stairs and posting envelopes through letterboxes, but telling people about my mum is still a little daunting. The concern is usually unnecessary. My girlfriend now not only knows my secret but has also told her Catholic Scottish-Irish family. If they can accept an Englishman with a lesbian mother for a suitor to their daughter, there's much cause for optimism. I have five life-long friends that I've known since primary school. They surely know the truth. I no longer give them the lodger story or deny what to them must be obvious. It is something we know but never mention, and that's how I like it. It's different with my football teammates. This Saturday I will be indulging in the to-and-fro of abusive changing-room banter. Little is kept from the bantering arena. The rules are simple: whatever is disclosed to the group is prey for the group. And what is known about you, defines you. Baz is defined by his drunken lust for larger women and Jez by his uneven testicles. My secret, then, remains hidden from my football friends. Not, as was the case in school, from fear of cruelty or banishment from the social circle. With maturity comes confidence and forthrightness that overcomes pubescent fears of social exclusion. And changing-room banter is all in good spirit, if not always in good taste. I choose to guard my mum's sexuality because I do not wish to be defined by it. I also do not want to be the butt of everyone's jokes. It is at home, even more than in the football changing room, where the secret we all know remains most hidden. My mum gives the lodger story to explain her relationship with Jane, or avoids the subject. Sometimes she introduces Jane as a friend she lives with, and leaves assumptions to be made either way, if at all. My mum, then, does not \"fly the flag\". Why? To me, my mum is gay. That she is gay has the relevance of her being tall, slim or blue-eyed. But to society she is \"a lesbian\", which has far more significance. She is a successful single mother, homeowner and career woman. She also happens to be sexually attracted to other women. She keeps the secret, I think, not so she can hide who she really is but so she can be who she really is. She also keeps the secret to protect her children. \"So who's Jane?\" Nan asked for the fifth time one afternoon. This time, however, no one answered. She had turned left rather than right out of the downstairs bathroom, opened the first door she confronted and walked into the garage. \"We're in here, Mum, your tea's waiting,\" my mum shouted from the kitchen. \"Oh lovely.\" With a gleaming smile Nan stepped on to the kitchen floor. \"Is this my tea?\" Nan asked. \"Yes, Mum.\" \"So when are you going to find another husband?\" Nan enquired as if there had never been such a sensible question. \"Oh, Mum, what do I want one of those for?\" Nan chuckled and took a few silent seconds to ponder another question. Her eyes wondered around the room and fell back on Mum. \"We don't want you being lonely,\" Nan remarked. \"I'm too busy to be lonely, and Jane's always about.\" \"Ah, that's right.\" Nan's eyes wondered once more. \"So who's Jane then?\" Mum began to give the lodger story, but she stopped. She looked at Nan's wide eyes, childlike smile and bobbing head. She took Nan's shaky old hand and told her what she never before dared. \"Jane is who I live with now. I don't need another man because I have Jane. Jane is like another husband; I love her and she loves me.\" Nan turned away, shocked. Her hand slipped from Mum's grip. Her eyes wandered up and around the room, as if gathering her thoughts. Her gaze fell from the ceiling, to the wall, and back to Mum. For the first time mother and daughter sat with no secrets between them. Nan smiled wide, gleaming. \"Is this my tea?\" Nan asked, unsure. \"Yes, Mum.\" \"So who's Jane then? And when are you going to find another husband?\" Some secrets are meant to be kept. \u00b7 All names have been changed"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
