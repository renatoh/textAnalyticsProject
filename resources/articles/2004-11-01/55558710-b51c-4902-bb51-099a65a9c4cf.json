The Observer can reveal allegations that Blunkett sent Fortier as many as 10 letters from his lawyers demanding DNA tests to establish whether he is the father of her unborn baby. Blunkett is alleged to have repeatedly written to Fortier, who is married and heavily pregnant, detailing the times and locations of their meetings during a three-year affair. Last night the Sunday Telegraph claimed that Blunkett had also used his influence as Home Secretary to obtain a visa for Fortier's Filipina nanny. The allegation was strenuously denied by the Home Secretary last night. 'I am very saddened that someone I cared so deeply for should seek, quite erroneously, to damage my public position. This cannot be in the interests of any of us,' he said. Blunkett said he had merely examined the application for the nanny, Leoncia 'Luz' Casalme, but had not intervened at any stage of the official process. It is also alleged that Blunkett and Fortier have already obtained private DNA test results that prove her two-year-old son William was fathered by Blunkett. Sources close to Fortier's husband, Stephen Quinn, last night said he would 'not be surprised' if the two-year-old turned out to be Blunkett's biological child. Blunkett was also accused of arranging first-class train tickets for Fortier that were intended for use by him as an MP. He has already faced claims that he put pressure on the US embassy to grant a visa for Fortier and her son to join him on holiday. One Home Office source last night dismissed the claims, saying it was 'a sadly bitter personal matter'. The source said the claims about the visa had been checked out and rejected by the Home Office. Last week, Fortier, 44, took leave from her job with a stress-related disorder. Friends are deeply concerned for her health, warning that Blunkett's barrage of letters is putting her under huge strain: 'She's very afraid of him. She finds him very bullying and overpowering.' The Home Secretary is reportedly planning to go to court to demand further tests to establish whether he is the father of Fortier's unborn child, despite the damage that such a public wrangle could inflict on his political career. Family law experts warned yesterday that such a case would be likely to be heard in the High Court because of the applicant's high profile. The paternity suit was initially said to be a shock to Fortier's husband, Stephen Quinn, 60, who believed he was the children's father. Press reports at first suggested this would be proved in the case of William, quoting one source as saying: 'William was achieved through a London hospital in such a way that only Stephen can be the father.' But a close friend of Fortier questioned this interpretation, saying that Quinn was unsure who was the father, but has said he will stand by his wife even if one or both are found to be Blunkett's. Irish-born Quinn, the publisher of Vogue magazine, married Fortier in 2001. Months later, she began an affair with Blunkett, 57, which lasted for three years until this summer. The friend of Quinn and Fortier said: 'Kimberly is taking a lot of pressure. Blunkett piles it on all the time: there are lawyers' letters day after day, 10 in total. 'They are very long and very heavy. They're endlessly repeating lists of the times they met, causing enormous hurt to her and her husband.' Quinn has resolved to keep the marriage alive, said one confidante. Supporters of Blunkett argue he just wants to be a responsible father to the children if they are his, and to contribute to their upkeep. However, friends fear that the Home Secretary, who is reported to have been devastated when Fortier ended the affair, appears unable to 'let go' of the failed relationship."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
