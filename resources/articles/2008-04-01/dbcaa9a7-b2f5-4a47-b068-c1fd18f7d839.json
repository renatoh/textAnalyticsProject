The mathematicians will claim they can still be caught by Hull City, but no one is expecting a 13-goal swing during Sunday's fixtures involving the two clubs. That much was obvious at the final whistle last night as thousands of fans poured on to the pitch to celebrate what is almost certain to be a third return to the top flight in six years. Such scenes had been anticipated beforehand but few present would have imagined the evening would produce such a dramatic finale. With 13 minutes remaining Southampton pilfered a goal through the 19-year-old substitute Adam Lallana which threatened to ruin the party. The gasps of disbelief from the fans were loud and clear before Chris Brunt thundered a low shot between Richard Wright's legs to spark pandemonium. \"I'm delighted for the players, the supporters and the staff,\" said Tony Mowbray, the Albion manager. \"Even though mathematically we haven't got enough points, it's got to be a strange weekend for us not to be in the Premier League. It's been a hard slog this season, especially on the back of the play-off defeat last season [against Derby] and also having the tag of the best team in the league, which can be a burden sometimes. But the players have overcome that.\" Mowbray would not be drawn on the suggestion that this promotion vindicated his footballing principles but, mindful of the fact that he feels some managers in the division have taken pleasure at defeating his side through less celebrated methods, he will doubtless feel an additional sense of satisfaction when he wakes up this morning. Nigel Pearson, Albion's former assistant and now the Southampton manager, is likely to be in a more thoughtful mood. Nothing other than an Albion win had been envisaged but a determined defensive performance from his players, allied to a few touches of good fortune, provided the platform for a spirited display which came agonisingly close to yielding three points. Instead Saints returned with one, although that reward may prove invaluable when Sheffield United visit on Sunday for a match which Pearson's side must not lose to have a chance of survival. \"It would have been nice to hold on,\" Pearson admitted. \"In the context of what we are looking for, a win would have been priceless. But there are still a lot of positives. A point gives us more of a fighting chance because it brings two more teams [Blackpool and Coventry] into the equation.\" Indeed another point on Sunday would be enough if Leicester, above Pearson's team on goal difference, were to lose at Stoke. Either way, Pearson was entitled to claim that his players would take encouragement from their contributions against an Albion side who failed to find their rhythm until the start of the second half. By that point Southampton might already have been ahead, Neil Clement appearing to handle Jason Euell's cross in the 37th minute only for the referee to wave away the appeals. It was a reprieve for Albion, but punishment followed later. After Ishmael Miller and Kevin Phillips had both squandered chances, Jermaine Wright's sliderule pass released Lallana. There was still much to do but, with the angle narrowing, the teenager speared a splendid low shot inside Dean Kiely's far post. Back came Albion, Clement and Luke Moore both heading over during a pulsating finish which culminated in Brunt's goal and mass celebrations. \"The players are enjoying the moment but I think they want to win the league,\" added Mowbray, whose side will be crowned champions if they can match Stoke's result. \"Hopefully we can finish the job off on the weekend.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
