Blackburn Rovers scored three times in the opening 18 minutes but, in the end, the final whistle came as a blessed relief. From a seemingly impossible position, Preston very nearly made their hosts pay. Twice they scored in the second half but Blackburn withstood the onslaught and, having climbed from 15th position in mid-October to third, their chances of a return to the Premiership are looking increasingly bright. The proliferation of Lancashire derbies has been a feature of the First Division so far with Bolton and Burnley also harbouring thoughts of representing the north-west in the Premiership next season. Yet, of the contenders clinging on to Fulham's coat-tails, Blackburn look by far the best equipped to file in as runners-up come next May. Under Graeme Souness the club have finally started showing clear signs that they are on the mend following the extravagant and ultimately ill-advised leadership of Brian Kidd and, with Mark Hughes and Matt Jansen leading the attack, goals are always likely. Jansen has been showing the form recently that once saw him coveted by Manchester United and, having coming off second best in a one-on-one with the Preston goalkeeper David Lucas after five minutes, he rapidly atoned with a classy opening goal. As he collected a throw-in and cut into the penalty area, it seemed at first that the striker had run the ball too far. But Jansen managed to ride Michael Appleton's challenge and lashed a venomous drive through Sean Gregan's legs. For Preston, worse was to follow almost immediately. This time Jansen surged down the left before whipping in a precise left-wing cross towards Hughes. From six yards out the rest was a formality. Preston were looking dispirited and by the time Martin Taylor flicked on Craig Hignett's corner for Jansen to head in his second the hosts' fourth successive home win was little more than a formality. Jonathan Macken restored some credibility eight minutes after the interval with a neatly taken goal and as Blackburn lost their impetus the visitors were suddenly playing with renewed urgency. When Henning Berg fouled Mark Rankine on 72 minutes and David Healy converted the penalty, full-blown anxiety was engulfing the home fans. Blackburn held on but only just. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
