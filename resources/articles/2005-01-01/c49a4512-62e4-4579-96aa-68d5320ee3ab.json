Unknown a year ago, Franz Ferdinand have been shortlisted for best British band, album, breakthrough, live act and rock act at the music industry prize-giving ceremony, to be held next month. The band, who have sold nearly 3m copies worldwide of their self-titled debut album, are renowned for interests that extend well beyond three chords. Last year they edited an edition of the Guardian's G2, and curated a night at London's Frieze art fair. In a shortlist dominated by the new and - unusually - the critically acclaimed, the Radiohead-inspired Muse received four nominations. Kasabian, who held underground gigs at their Leicester farm, got three, as did the Streets, Keane and Natasha Bedingfield. The dance category has been dropped, reflecting the ailing health of the British club scene. In its place are a new best live act award and a one-off gong for best song of the past 25 years. The seemingly random timeframe conveniently ties in with the Brits' 25th anniversary. After a year in which British music was accused of selling out to middle-of-the-road acts such as Jamie Cullum - this was on top of internet piracy and singles sales falling to a historic low - the nominations are a ray of artistic light. Traditionally, when the going gets tough, British music gets creative. The going is tough indeed: in the last week of December just 7,000 sales were required for a single to reach No 3 in the chart. Previously, it would have taken at least 15,000. Last week legal internet downloads overtook sales of shop-bought singles for the first time, at 312,000 to 282,000. Some predict as almost inevitable the demise of the physical single. Meanwhile, the controversial merger of the giant Sony and BMG labels precipitated more staff cuts in a year that has seen most companies shedding employees. The rise of Franz Ferdinand, Kasabian and the rap act the Streets is held by industry observers as evidence that British talent flourishes in adverse conditions. \"There's been a shift back toward acts that are being allowed to develop and grow organically,\" said Paul Williams of the trade magazine Music Week. \"There was a realisation by the industry two or three years ago that they were struggling to find new career artists. \"There were so many here today, gone tomorrow TV acts that were big for six months but didn't sell albums. Franz Ferdinand are signed to Domino, a very credible indie label.\" There will still be a decent portion of cheese served up at the awards, which will be held in London on February 9. The best song category - voted for by Radio 2 listeners - will provoke plenty of waving arms in the next weeks, as voters choose from Joy Division's suicide ballad Love Will Tear Us Apart to the original Pop Idol winner Will Young's chirpy Leave Right Now. It was also announced that Bob Geldof will receive the Outstanding Contribution award. Half a million pounds of the proceeds of the February 9 show will be donated to children affected by the tsunami disaster. \u00b7 Caroline Sullivan is a Guardian music critic And the contenders are ...
