With the Gold Cup fancy Kingscliff the latest well backed horse to be scratched, the Ladbrokes spokesman Balthazar Fabricius estimated an industry-wide \u00a31m loss for ante-post punters who lose their stake when their selections are taken out. \u00b7At least the biggest on-course bet of the day was a winner - one intrepid punter had \u20ac200,000 on the Champion Hurdler Hardy Eustace at 7-2 to take \u20ac700,000 out of the Irish rails bookmaker Chronicle. \u00b7Missing from the ring this week is racing fan Alan Shearer, who is detained on football duties but may end the Festival as a winning owner. Shearer part-owns Akilak, rated a big chance in Friday's Triumph Hurdle, and the omens looked good yesterday when Arcalis, from the same stable, took the opening race with ease. William Hill offer 14-1 about Shearer scoring tonight against Olympiakos and Akilak rounding off a Geordie dream double. \u00b7With every single outright favourite finishing out of the frame yesterday, it was no surprise that the Placepot bet (which requires Tote punters to pick a placed horse in all six races) paid the best part of \u00a37,500 for a \u00a31 unit. Even less of a shock that nobody scooped the Jackpot bet - pick all six winners - which rolls over to today. \u00b7 The Irish money has already arrived for Oh Be The Hokey in today's amateur riders' Kim Muir Chase (4.40). Ladbrokes reported a plunge that has seen the odds tumble from 33-1 to a \"nervous\" 8-1 last night. \u00b7Expect a quiet week on the FTSE this week as traders focus on the action at Cheltenham. Betfair, the website on which punters can bet against one another, is reckoning on handling more transactions in the four days of the Festival than all of the European stock markets combined. \u00b7And remember, no matter how hard the going gets for punters, as the slogan of ring bookie Rickert Limited reassured customers yesterday: \"A bad day at the races is still better than a good day at work.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
