One charity that can explain it is Motorvations, since the at-risk and educationally excluded teenagers it offers motor mechanic training to may well arrive at its workshops unfit, overweight or undernourished. Based in Romford, Essex, Motorvations annually provides 90 or so 13- to 17-year-olds, often from very difficult backgrounds, with high-quality training to gain recognised qualifications in motor maintenance, tyre fitting and welding, along side basic skills in numeracy, literacy and IT. The training takes place in a supportive environment where the young people are also helped to deal with issues such as physical and mental health problems. Having experienced at first hand the difficulties of training someone who is hungry, moody, hyperactive or lacking energy and agility, Motorvations is putting its Guardian Charity Award of \u00a36,000 towards a new gym, nutrition centre and juice bar. This will boost its wider work on fitness and diet, enhance its lifeskills education on sexual health, smoking and drugs misuse, and provide a social centre for youngsters, as well as offering courses related to leisure and nutrition. The charity's administrator, Laura Hill, says the new PC it has won \"will be a valuable addition to our learning rooms for both tuition and job searching\". She adds that for the dozen staff - led by managers Geoff Webb and Chris Lee - meeting the needs of very disturbed young people who have had terrible life experiences is both a continual challenge and a reward. \"We aim to improve young people's self-esteem, confidence, social skills and behaviour. Watching these children grow in confidence and knowledge keeps us all committed,\" Hill says. It is hard to overstate the problems many of its recruits face, coming from socially deprived backgrounds, low-income households, or families with a history of unemployment, violence or substance misuse. Its over-16 programme dedicated to those who are Neet - Not in Education, Employment or Training - offers help to a particularly vulnerable group; no longer funded by the educational authorities, but unable to receive advice or benefits from the Job Centre until they reach 18. After eight years in operation, Motorvations is convinced of its success in getting marginalised and hard-to-reach young people previously lost in the system to find positive solutions for themselves. As well as recognising its staff's enthusiasm and commitment, Motorvations hopes the award will boost its profile and credibility. This will be essential for its six-year plan to become self sufficient while doubling student numbers and expanding its courses into new areas, from construction - 2012's Olympics are just down the road - and rural skills to finance and self-employment. As well as its courses, Motorvations keeps its recruits busy -refurbishing bicycles to help other charities or doing physical activities such as mountain biking, pony trekking, go-karting, mountain climbing and canoeing. Among the charity's \"graduates\" is Dominic Ling, aged 18, who made such good use of his time with Motorvations that he is mentoring new entrants and has been appointed to its board of trustees. He said the key was great staff: \"People here are not like usual teachers. They can be serious if they need to, but they're more like best friends who can help you with problems.\" Ling admits: \"I was getting caught for car crime, couldn't get on to a college course and was spending too much time out on the streets.\" But he adds: \"Motorvations was a chance to put my education back on track. It changed my life. Now I'm at college, planning to go to university - and I haven't seen the police in a year and a half.\" haveringmotorvations.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
