The Late Show aired after Donald Trump spoke from the White House and \u201ctried to poison American democracy\u201d, said host Stephen Colbert. Still on his election special set, Colbert wore all black, \u201cdressed for a funeral\u201d, he said, \u201cbecause Donald Trump tried really hard to kill something tonight\u201d with a 15-minute rant so full of lies and attempts to discredit the electoral process that even network news, finally, cut away. Colbert planned for a somber evening, he added, not because he\u2019s \u201ca prophet, it\u2019s just that he\u2019s so predictable. For weeks, we\u2019ve been talking about how there\u2019d be a \u2018red mirage\u2019, and how all those outstanding Biden mail-in ballots might let Joe catch up, and then Trump would probably come out around, I don\u2019t know, Thursday? Maybe evening news time, and pretend that he won and accuse everyone else of cheating. The guy does not have another gear, get a new act!\u201d Donald Trump has always been clear with his intentions, Colbert continued, rolling a clip of the president from 20 October 2016: \u201cI will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election \u2013 if I win.\u201d \u201cSo we all knew he would do this,\u201d said a visibly emotional Colbert, who took a long pause. \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t know is that it would hurt so much. I didn\u2019t expect this to break my heart. For him to cast a dark shadow on our most sacred right, from the briefing room in the White House \u2013 our house, not his \u2013 that is devastating.\u201d The usually affable host urged, sans jokes, Americans to take in and reject Trump\u2019s attempt to unlawfully grab power, including congressional Republicans. \u201cFor all the predictable behavior of the last few days, and the last four years, right now something unpredictable needs to happen: Republicans have to speak up. All of them. Because for evil to succeed, all that is necessary is for good men to do nothing. \u201cSo say something right now, Republicans,\u201d he added. \u201cNot later, not after you\u2019ve stuck your finger up in the wind or wherever you want to put it. Right now.\u201d Colbert concluded with a call for Republicans to acknowledge \u201ceverything that was obvious to so many of us\u201d \u2013 namely, that \u201cDonald Trump is a fascist. And when it comes to democracy v fascism, I\u2019m sorry, there are not fine people on both sides. So you need to choose: Donald Trump or the American people.\u201d Jimmy Kimmel \u201cPlease stay calm, the process is working,\u201d urged Jimmy Kimmel on Thursday night, as counters continued to process ballots in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona. \u201cWe are watching a president bleed out in real time right now.\u201d Kimmel refused to air any clips from Trump\u2019s lie-filled non-concession: \u201cI won\u2019t give him the pleasure of showing what he said tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the only thing he didn\u2019t do was pull off his wig and reveal that he\u2019s been Vlad Putin all along. It was a litany of lies, threats, just a litany of despicable and incoherent attacks on democracy in the United States. \u201cAt the end of that speech, he should\u2019ve been arrested,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cIf they could\u2019ve found handcuffs small enough to take him away, they would have.\u201d Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers dismantled the various and contradictory attempts to stop or recount votes by the Trump campaign. \u201cNo one is buying these false declarations of victory, in part because even the Trump team can\u2019t keep their bullshit straight,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cIn Pennsylvania, they want to stop the count while they\u2019re ahead; in Arizona, however, they\u2019re suddenly concerned that the counting will stop while they\u2019re behind. If you thought Trump\u2019s ghouls had plumbed the depths of their shamelessness, think again.\u201d Meyers pointed to Trump surrogates Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who appeared on Fox News on Thursday to demand votes still be counted in Arizona, where Trump was behind. \u201cYou almost gotta applaud their ability to pivot on a dime from one brazen lie to another contradictory lie,\u201d he said, \u201cbut hey, you heard it, from the president\u2019s closest and most trusted advisers: \u2018Let\u2019s take our time and count the votes.\u2019 And we agree: count every vote, in every state, everywhere.\u201d An hour later, however, Donald Trump tweeted: \u201cSTOP THE COUNT!\u201d \u2013 evidence that \u201ctrying to stay on message with Trump is like trying to ride a mechanical bull slathered in olive oil\u201d, joked Meyers. Trevor Noah And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah also mocked the Trump campaign\u2019s incoherent arguments for a Trump victory, as his supporters shouted \u201ccount the votes\u201d and \u201cstop the count\u201d at protests in different states. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we were all terrified that Trump supporters would coordinate a civil war, and yet these guys can\u2019t even agree on a slogan to shout in the streets,\u201d Noah joked. \u201cBecause they\u2019re chanting to count the votes if Trump is behind in the state, but then if he\u2019s ahead, then they\u2019re chanting to stop the count. I mean, what happens if the state switches? \u201cBut if Trump can\u2019t win the election in the streets, he has one final plan: to win the election in the tweets,\u201d Noah added, pointing to Trump\u2019s wholly unsupported claim, on Twitter, that he won in Michigan. \u201cCome on, Donald, what are you doing, man? Just because you shout it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s yours. This is the election, not riding shotgun,\u201d Noah said. Noah added: \u201cIsn\u2019t it ironic that Trump spent months warning that rioters were going to loot all the stores, but now he\u2019s the one trying to loot the electoral college.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
