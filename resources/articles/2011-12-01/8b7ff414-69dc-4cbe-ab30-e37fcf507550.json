Few who attend Scottish Premier League matches will argue that the permission that has been granted by the league for a return of terraced areas in grounds is not sensible. This is one of precious few occasions when football's legislators have listened to those who pay money, week on week, for a diminishing product at grounds which routinely lack atmosphere. Empty stands at stadiums across Scotland are indicators of declining interest. There would have been no push to reintroduce standing if the game was in a healthier state. In England, football's ongoing boom at the top level plays a part in the Premier League's categorical rejection of a return to terracing, though groups of supporters want and continue to campaign for precisely that. Scotland was not bound by law to accept the recommendations of the Taylor report but did so nonetheless. That was fair, given the scrutiny that was applied to safety after the Hillsborough disaster of 1989. The construction of all-seater grounds wounded many Scottish clubs financially, and most have not yet recovered. An unwillingness from the authorities to look at the potential for safe-standing areas, on the basis that \"other clubs have spent money on stands\", represented flawed logic. It can almost be guaranteed that every week an altercation will occur between stewards at an SPL match and a group of fans \"illegally\" standing at their seats. Recently, a party of Motherwell supporters were thrown out of Pittodrie after such a spat was not resolved amicably. It is a farcical situation. At Celtic's recent annual general meeting, a shareholder asked why the club could possibly be of a mind to rip out perfectly good seats in one area of their ground in order to let fans stand. He was roundly jeered. Celtic's supporters at St Johnstone on Sunday, as many as 4,000 of them, stood, en masse, for the entire match. Manchester United's followers have adopted a similar approach, a matter which has vexed the authorities in England. Yet people can attend a music concert at Old Trafford and be left alone to stand, and similar relaxed rules are in place at, for example, the densely populated Grand National and rugby matches of both codes. The implication that football supporters are guaranteed to behave differently from those other groups is considered by some to be stereotypical and offensive. At Hampden Park, the hardcore contingent of the Tartan Army who populate the north stand for Scotland games are on their feet for 90 minutes. When people consider safety, they must look at this scenario \u2013 thousands of people are currently standing and leaping about in seated areas, where the risk of injury is real. Some would argue the solution to this would be simply to educate or arrest supporters until they learn to sit down. The alternative solution is more practical. There should be an element of choice. There are those who want to sit, who are hindered by those standing in front and around them. A knock-on effect of a terrace would be cheaper tickets, another aspect which should be welcomed in this economic climate. It is a bit like the provision of a designated amount of low-cost housing. Ross County hosted Celtic in a League Cup tie earlier this season and supporters stood at each end of Victoria Park. If, as expected, County earn promotion to the SPL, there is no logic to them investing seven figures in extra seating when they have proven they can host one of the two biggest clubs in the country with people standing perfectly safely. Margaret Aspinall, chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, argues vehemently that standing should never be permitted because of lessons learned in 1989. Kenny Dalglish, the Liverpool manager, echoed that sentiment on Tuesday. \"My thoughts are still the same. I would prefer the all-seater stadium,\" he said. \"I don't think there's any need for us to change our mind from what it was in 1989. I have the same position as it was then.\" That view has to be respected. Nonetheless, it is simplistic to say that Hillsborough occurred because of a terrace. Standing areas must have strict safety rules. Barrier fences, which would stop people spilling on to the pitch in the event of crushing or pushing, must not return. In Europe, most notably in Germany, safe terraces bear no resemblance to the crumbling wrecks which were visible all over Britain in the 1980s. What SPL clubs will seek at first is one small, designated standing area, which will have ticket numbers policed and restricted. This is a positive step. There seems no prospect of it being replicated in England, for the time being at least, but fans there seeking a move back to terrace culture will hope the forthcoming experiences in Scotland offer more substance to their argument."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
