Chelsea's coach was quoted in the Marca sports daily as saying: \"I already have Abramovich's sword embedded in me. I'm convinced that even if I win the Champions League I will be sacked. Abramovich knows nothing about football. That's the real shame.\" However, a statement from his agents First Artist denied Ranieri used any such phrase. It said: \"Claudio Ranieri would like to make it clear that contrary to the alleged statements in today's Marca he has the highest regard for Roman Abramovich and everything he is trying to achieve for Chelsea. \"This is a complete misinterpretation of an interview done three weeks ago and should not be taken seriously. The only thing that should be taken seriously is tonight's game. \"Claudio loves Chelsea and will not let this distract him from focusing on a successful season.\" Ranieri's representatives claim the coach had said Abramovich knew nothing about football until he saw a game in Manchester last year, but that now the Russian was hooked. Vincenzo Morabito, Ranieri's Italian agent, also insisted he still wants to stay at the Blues. Morabito said: \"We are not talking to any other clubs. He has a three-year deal with Chelsea and we believe at the moment he is going to stay. If Chelsea FC decide something else, we will look around somewhere else.\" Marca printed the lengthy interview in question-and-answer format and the published version contained no reference to Abramovich becoming hooked after watching a game in Manchester. In fact, Ranieri is quoted as elaborating on his frustration with the Chelsea owner. \"From the moment he arrived, within a month we had to sign 11 players. It was crazy. And on top of everything, Abramovich's people still aren't convinced. What do they want? \"It was a very tough job to sign so many players and put them together and make them play. Abramovich doesn't realise that. They think: 'If I sign that one and that one and that one, then I'll win'.\" Asked if people such as Abramovich were positive for the game, Ranieri replied: \"No, but what can I do? The person with the money calls the shots.\" Ranieri also appeared frustrated that his team was criticised for not always playing attractive football despite being in the last four of the Champions League and second in the Premiership. \"You can't always play well and win,\" Ranieri said. \"Because of this, I don't understand Abramovich's complaints. What does he want? My blood?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
