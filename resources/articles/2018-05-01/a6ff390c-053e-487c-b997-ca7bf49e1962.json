Staff at Salisbury district hospital have described the extraordinary situation they faced when the Skripals were brought in for emergency care after being found unconscious on a bench in the town after their attempted assassination on 4 March. Doctors said there was concern over the potential scale of the incident and if more casualties would be admitted as a result of contamination. Dr Stephen Jukes, an intensive care consultant, told BBC2\u2019s Newsnight in an interview to be broadcast on Tuesday: \u201cWhen we first were aware this was a nerve agent, we were expecting them not to survive. We would try all our therapies. We would ensure the best clinical care. But all the evidence was there that they would not survive.\u201d On admission, the medical team suspected both were experiencing an opioid overdose, but that diagnosis quickly changed to a nerve agent poisoning. Dr Duncan Murray, the head of intensive care, recalled his shock as he spoke to the nurse in charge, \u201cand it was this conversation I really could never have imagined in my wildest imagination having with anyone\u201d. Once the nerve agent was diagnosed, it was simply a matter of keeping the Skripals alive. They were heavily sedated and given heavy doses of drugs designed to protect them from the effects of the poison to help restart their bodies\u2019 natural production of a key enzyme. But when DS Nick Bailey, one of the officers who had attended the scene, was admitted shortly afterwards with similar symptoms, hospital staff started to wonder if they too might fall victim to the nerve agent. Lorna Wilkinson, the director of nursing at the hospital, said: \u201cI suppose the key marker for me was when the PC [Bailey, see footnote] was admitted with symptoms \u2013 there was real concern as to how big this could get.\u201d She said she thought: \u201cHave we just gone from having two index patients [to] having something that actually could become all-consuming and involve many casualties? Because we really didn\u2019t know at that point.\u201d The Skripals and Bailey have been discharged from hospital. When asked for their long-term prognosis, Dr Christine Blanshard, the medical director, said: \u201cThe honest answer is we don\u2019t know\u201d. The \u201ctotal world experience\u201d of treating novichok poisoning was that at the Salisbury hospital. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say we\u2019re still learning,\u201d she said. The hospital received advice and help processing tests from international experts including from the Porton Down defence research laboratory, renowned for its chemical weapons expertise, said Murray. Yulia Skripal was discharged in April and she made a statement thanking the hospital last week. It was several more weeks before her father was able to be released. Moscow has repeatedly denied responsibility for the attack. The interviews will be broadcast on Newsnight on BBC2 on Tuesday 29 May. This article was amended on 30 May 2018.
