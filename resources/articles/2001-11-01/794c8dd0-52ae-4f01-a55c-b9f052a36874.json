It was Brazil's sixth defeat in their 10-country group - an extraordinary number given that they had lost only one qualifier in the previous 70 years. It means that after nearly two years and 17 matches their chances of scraping into South America's fourth and final automatic qualification spot will boil down to 90 nerve-racking minutes against Venezuela. Bolivia had the advantage of playing 3,600m above sea level, leaving Brazil - who flew in two hours before the game to counter altitude sickness - noticeably out of puff. Brazil, however, remain in fourth because Uruguay, now one point behind them in fifth, drew 1-1 with Ecuador in Quito - a result that qualifies the tiny Andean nation for the World Cup finals for the first time. Ecuador's feat was greeted by wild celebrations which left four people dead - all killed in car accidents - and 70 people injured. Argentina and Paraguay lead the group and are also through. The top four qualify automatically and the fifth meets the Oceania group winners Australia in a two-leg play-off. Logic favours Brazil to beat second-bottom Venezuela at home next Wednesday, although their coach Luis Felipe Scolari was already raising the possibility that they might have to make the long-haul flight to Sydney. Uruguay face the harder task of beating Argentina in Montevideo and hoping that Brazil slip up. Brazil started well in La Paz and took the lead in the 25th minute through Edilson's opportunistic shot from outside the area. But it was not long before Bolivia were in control. Two minutes before half-time the Brazil defender Juan slipped to allow Lider Paz to fire a low shot past Marcos. Brazil appeared unable to judge the ball, which was bouncing high and flying through the thin Andean air. After the interval Baldivieso took a free-kick from 40 yards which swung further than expected and caught Marcos off guard, looping over his head and into the net. Once Bolivia took the lead Brazil fell to pieces - as they have so many times in the qualifiers - and could have lost by twice the 3-1 scoreline. Baldivieso sealed the third from the penalty spot. Scolari said he took responsibility for the defeat and he defended Marcos's positioning for the second goal. \"Any shot here is difficult for the goalkeeper,\" he said. \"I continue to have confidence in him. He has the right to make mistakes occasionally like any other member of the team.\" The game was Scolari's fifth defeat since he became, in June, Brazil's fourth coach since they were runners-up in the 1998 World Cup. He recently took the squad to a firm of astrological consultants to ask advice about whom he should pick - a move which has begun to chip away at his public support. The Venezuela match is to be held in the north-eastern city Sao Luis - which does not even have a team in Brazil's 28-club first division - partly because the pressure from fans in the big cities is seen as undesirable. Ecuador's hero of the campaign has been the Colombian coach Hernan Dario Gomez, who was persuaded to stay on in the job despite being shot in the leg in an attack this year. Paraguay's joy at their second consecutive World Cup finals was tempered by news that Fifa has banned their captain Jose Luis Chilavert from the tournament's first two games. The goalkeeper spat in the face of Brazil's Roberto Carlos when the teams met in August.
