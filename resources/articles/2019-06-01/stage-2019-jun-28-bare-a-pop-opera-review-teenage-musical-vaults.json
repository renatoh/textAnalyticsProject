It\u2019s a coming-of-age musical set in a Catholic boarding school and focuses on the fear, doubt and passion in a gay relationship between two teenage boys. Jon Hartmere\u2019s lyrics are dark and punchy and Damon Intrabartolo\u2019s score rumbles with the turbulent energy of teenage life. Here\u2019s a musical that should brim with personality and pertinence, but Julie Atherton\u2019s haphazard production is simply underwhelming. The band sit on a balcony to the side of the stage and never really feel part of the action (the key changes come as a surprise to everyone). The actors perform on a raised stage with a thrust platform that splits the audience in two and makes it a nightmare to connect with the crowd below. A dodgy sound system blurs the lyrics and the superfluous activity at the edges of the stage \u2013 lots of mumbling and bluster from the ensemble \u2013 constantly distracts. Libby Watson\u2019s design features a line of endlessly rotating lockers, and Stuart Rogers\u2019 choreography involves an awful lot of spinning and thumping of chairs. There are tantalising flashes of what might have been, particularly with some strong solo numbers in the second half. Lizzie Emery nails her mournful ballad, All Grown Up, and Georgie Lovatt is a touching mix of fragility and defiance as the lonely and overweight Nadia. Stacy Francis shines as the wisecracking Sister Chantelle and her big number, God Don\u2019t Make No Trash, is generous and wise; a rare burst of feeling and purpose. It\u2019s a blessed relief in an otherwise oddly muted show. At the Vaults, London, until 4 August."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
