Surrey police said that the man, who was arrested on Wednesday night, has been released \"pending further inquiries\". A spokeswoman said that he had not been released on bail for legal reasons, as he had already been before a magistrate to have the length of his time in custody extended. The man, who was being questioned over the brutal attack on the 26-year-old mother in a lane in Little Bookham, Surrey, will now have to be re-arrested if police wish to detain him again. But Detective Superintendent Adrian Harper, who is leading the investigation, said that there has been a \"huge leap forward\" in the last 48 hours in the inquiry. The man was arrested at Croydon police station, which comes under the authority of the Metropolitan Police, on Wednesday night. His name had been passed to the Metropolitan Police by the Surrey force. After being held for 36 hours, police went before Staines Magistrates' Court this morning to obtain a 24-hour extension. Mr Harper said: \"This is a large and complex inquiry that has taken a huge leap forward in the last 48 hours. \"The case presents very complex forensic issues, which are being progressed as quickly as possible but will nevertheless take some weeks to solve, even using the latest and most advanced techniques. \"It is not possible to keep this man in custody whilst we resolve these inquiries. \"We are delighted with the response from the media and public, which has resulted in over 400 calls being received. \"A number of lines of inquiry remain active.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
