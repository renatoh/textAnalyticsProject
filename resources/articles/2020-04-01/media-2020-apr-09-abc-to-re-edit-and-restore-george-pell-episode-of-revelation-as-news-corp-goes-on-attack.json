Episode three of the series addressed historic allegations about Pell and aired before he was freed from prison and had his convictions overturned. The broadcaster responded to the decision of the high court to quash Pell\u2019s conviction by pulling the third episode of the series focusing on the Ballarat diocese from iview and ABC Online. \u201cIn response to the high court\u2019s decision regarding Cardinal George Pell, the ABC has temporarily removed episode three of Revelation from its platforms while updating its content,\u201d a spokesman for the ABC said. But the ABC is standing by Revelation and all its other programs, podcasts and articles about Pell. \u201cThe ABC has \u2013 and will continue to \u2013 report accurately and without fear or favour on stories that are in the public interest, including this one,\u201d an ABC spokesman said. \u201cWe stand by our reporters and our stories.\u201d ABC investigative journalist Louise Milligan, who broke stories about abuse in the Catholic church for ABC TV programs 7.30 and Four Corners says her award-winning book Cardinal: The Rise and Fall of George Pell will not be withdrawn from sale. \u201cNothing happens to my book,\u201d Milligan told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt speaks for itself. \u201cI stand by it 100% and so does my publisher [MUP]. I am proud of the journalism in it, which exposed a dark history in the Catholic Church \u2013 how a generation of children were let down and continued to be let down when they came forward to tell their stories as adults. \u201cI am in awe of their bravery. I am thinking of every single one of them and hoping they are OK. They deserved better. They still deserve better.\u201d Milligan and a host of other journalists who reported on Pell are under attack by News Corp commentator Andrew Bolt and other Pell supporters who claim the ABC colluded with Victoria police to have Pell charged. In a fresh attack on Milligan on his Sky News program Bolt claimed the book Cardinal \u201cslammed Pell\u201d, was \u201ca real hit job\u201d and that Milligan \u201cled the crusade\u201d against Pell. The Australian\u2019s columnist Gerard Henderson agreed with Bolt and said there had been a \u201cmedia pile-on led by the ABC\u201d against Pell. \u201cLed by Victoria police, in cooperation with the ABC, the whole web of media pile on against George Pell went on for years,\u201d Henderson old Sky News. Australian Catholic University vice-chancellor Greg Craven also took aim at the alleged campaign by the \u201cVictorian police and the ABC\u201d. \u201cThe coercive power of the state was engaged in a very cosy deal with the national broadcaster,\u201d Craven said on Sky News. Professor Mark Pearson, a media law expert from Griffith University, says the biggest danger for the media lay in defaming Pell beyond what he had been convicted of. \u201cThe defences of a fair and accurate report of a court case and fair comment upon such a case will normally defend material about any court case until someone has been acquitted,\u201d Pearson told Guardian Australia. \u201cOnce someone has been acquitted any new material would need to be defensible on the grounds of truth which is a very difficult defence to prove because of the need for evidence and the fact that you\u2019d need to prove the truth of the imputations. \u201cHistorical material is normally safe as long as it does not go beyond the material that was presented in the court. Speculative historical material or material to do with other matters may not be defensible. \u201cAnd people would need to be very careful, with any criminal case, what they publish once someone has been acquitted of a crime.\u201d Revelation is a coproduction with In Films for the ABC, financed by Screen Australia with assistance from Screen NSW."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
