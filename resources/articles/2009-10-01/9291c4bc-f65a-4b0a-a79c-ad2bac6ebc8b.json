Sir Christopher Kelly, the standards watchdog, will outline proposals next week when his report is published that go further than MPs had expected. Tough new rules on outside earnings, which require MPs to register their hourly pay, will be tightened still further. It is understood that Kelly will call on MPs to make a declaration to constituents before their election outlining exactly what outside work they wish to do. To the surprise of senior figures in the main parties, Kelly is to cut back the payments made to MPs when they stand down from parliament. At the moment they are entitled to a resettlement grant of between \u00a332,383 and \u00a364,766 when they leave Westminster to allow for adjusting to life outside parliament. The level of the payment depends on the age of the retiring MP and length of Commons service. Kelly is expected to say that the payment should be a fixed sum. This could amount to a few thousands pounds covering several months' salary. Kelly was said to be mildly irritated, but not surprised, when details of his report were leaked on Tuesday night. As expected, Kelly will propose that MPs lose the right to claim mortgage interest on their second home and instead rent a property. This will hit David Cameron and George Osborne, who emerged relatively unscathed from the expenses scandal but who make high claims on their mortgages. They will accept the recommendation from Kelly, who is expected to give MPs up to five years to abide by his rules. Among the other changes proposed by Kelly are: \u2022 Imposition of a 60-minute rule. This will mean MPs will not be able to claim for a second home if their journey from their constituency railway station to Westminster is 60 minutes or less. Kelly believes only 12 MPs will lose out. \u2022 Abolition of the \u00a310,400 communications allowance which helps MPs send out leaflets to constituents promoting their work. The Tories have campaigned for its abolition. Labour is keen to maintain it because Lord Ashcroft, the Tory deputy chairman, has flooded marginal constituencies with millions of pounds. \u2022 End to the right of MPs to employ relatives. This is likely to be phased in, and might not apply to existing MPs. \u2022 Reduction in first-class train travel and in the daily \u00a325 subsistence allowance for MPs. MPs across the Commons are angered by the rules which, they say, fail to take heed of their need to maintain two homes. A shadow frontbencher said of the 60-minute rule: \"This one is a non-starter. If I ever need to go back to my constituency I need to be there with a car \u2013 you wouldn't go there without a car \u2013 so I would drive in and it would take me about two hours.\" A female junior minister said: \"I wouldn't be surprised if this new rule would see women dissuaded from entering parliament. Imagine them standing on dark station platforms at midnight waiting to get home to their family before getting up at 6am to start it all again. If he really does propose this, women will say no thanks.\" Sir Nicholas Winterton, the Tory MP for Macclesfield, who is standing down at the election after criticism of his expenses, criticised Kelly. Calling on MPs to take \"a tough line\", he asked: \"How much is he paid? What's his golden civil service payment? How many jobs does he do? Why is he to dictate? What experience does he have of being an MP, the hours worked, the costs? He is determined to hit MPs on the head and undermine them.\" But others said MPs should accept the proposals. Tony Wright, the Labour chairman of the Commons public administration committee, said: \"There will be individual hardship. There will be individual injustice. But I am afraid that is the price we are all going to have to pay for this terrible mess \u2026 if we really do want to clean this system up we just have to bite the bullet.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
