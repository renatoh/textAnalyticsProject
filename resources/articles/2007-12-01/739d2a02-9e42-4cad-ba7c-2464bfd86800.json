Moravcik, a hero at Parkhead during his time in Glasgow between 1998 and 2002, is keen to forge a career in management after a spell coaching Slovakia's under-17 team and his identified Dunfermline as the ideal post in which to begin that process. \"There is 100% interest from Lubo in that job,\" said a source close to the Slovakwho has scored 29 goals in 75 league starts for Celtic. Neil Lennon and Steven Pressley have been linked with replacing Kenny but neither is understood to be interested.
