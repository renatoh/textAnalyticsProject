So it's probably in that environment that my column has thrived most. It coincided with the rise of the \"festival circuit\", and I was fortunate to have the willing co-operation of the Observer and the festivals themselves in getting to cover so many of them. I still recall the jolt of a morning vodka with Alan Parker in Moscow where, because his Pink Floyd film The Wall was the most famous bootleg of the Soviet era, he is some kind of deity. Marrakech is a wonderful setting for a film festival and I shall cherish an afternoon with Martin Scorsese there, even though he spilt my mint tea as he crossed his little legs under one of those low tray tables. Bangkok briefly held a terrific festival, where I began a friendship with Olivier Assayas, although I mostly remember it for the food. San Sebasti\u00e1n has the best food, of course, and the biggest drinks, although I also saw some fabulous South American films there at the height of the continent's new wave (such as Bomb\u00f3n el Perro) and had my first interview with Woody Allen and the neurotic cast of Melinda and Melinda. The saddest festival has to be Edinburgh, which has ineluctably withered since moving outside the rest of the summer festivities there. It's also the worst walk, along that stinky road to the multiplex. Give me Venice's smelly canals. Although it too is \"at risk\" from the Toronto and Telluride festivals, I've had some lovely times there and seen some memorable films (When the Levees Broke, Children of Men, Couscous). A moonlit swim in the Cipriani pool with Keira Knightley after the Atonement premiere; a bottle of champagne on the Excelsior beach with Samantha Morton and Laetita Casta; a dance with Spike Lee to Michael Jackson's Bad. At Shanghai there was a dinner with the late, lovely Anthony Minghella after we'd spent an afternoon talking to students at a gigantic university, followed by my DJing at the Chinese premiere of Woody Allen's Match Point and getting Maggie Cheung, Andy Lau and Zhang Ziyi on the dancefloor. That's not to mention Taormina, Locarno, Dublin (I love Dublin) and our own brilliant LFF. But the winner will always be Cannes, where for 12 days \u2013 and nights \u2013 in May of every year this century, I have been at my happiest and Trashiest. Best party The lavish MTV Cannes parties at Pierre Cardin's bubble house are no longer. Gone are the private villas and the snows of yesteryear. Now there are more PR people than stars and journalists. They have us all by the balls. But the best things happen without pricey VIP rooms and clipboards. AmfAR's Cinema against Aids gala at Cannes is always spectacular. I went when it was at the Moulin in Mougins and Sharon Stone did the auction \u2013 a lady to whom you couldn't say no. But now it's at my favourite hotel in the world, the Hotel du Cap in Antibes. I danced with Chlo\u00eb Sevigny and Cameron Diaz there once, and then gave generously to charity. The Vanity Fair party at the Oscars is ridiculously fabulous, but I prefer the unruly old bashes from the early days of the Bifas, when Ray Winstone lead the way. His daughter, Jaime, upholds his legacy. It sometimes goes the other way too \u2013 one of the worst parties was when Vera Drake opened the LFF in 2004: amazing venue, great film, but such a downer that everyone walked around the Great Court in the British Museum in sepulchral silence. However, a key party that sticks in my mind was in 2002, when the Bafta awards ceremony first moved from a slow berth in April to become a vital part of the awards season. Suddenly I was at the Sanderson hotel with Nicole Kidman, Dustin Hoffman, Russell Crowe, Salma Hayek and Julia Roberts all milling around Harvey Weinstein. Madonna popped in later and Anna Friel fell over on the dancefloor. I remember the injection of glamour that it brought to a cold February, helping to re-establish London as the world destination for such things during the next decade. Best star Anna Friel and Samantha Morton were very good value at parties. Michael Fassbender's an impressive sight in full swing too, and a properly good bloke. Sally Hawkins is really, really funny. George Clooney is a giggle \u2013 he showed me how to tie a windsor knot \u2013 and Tilda Swinton is as passionate as she is hilarious and witty. Obviously at parties and dinners, and off the record, you get the best bits of a person. I was fortunate enough to host 350 episodes of the Film Weekly podcast for the Observer too, and had some wonderful guests giving amazing insights. Sometimes it was the least expected who were the richest voices. Ray Harryhausen was a delight; ditto Bruce Robinson recalling making Withnail and I, Terence Davies getting so excited he turned red, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd on his friend Lars von Trier's infamous Hitler gag, Sir Norman Foster at the top of the Gherkin and Werner Herzog discussing The Simpsons. My favourite male guests were David Thewlis, Vincent Cassel, John Sayles, Danny Boyle, Jacques Audiard and Denzel Washington. Of the women, it must be Lynne Ramsay, Naomie Harris, B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo, Mira Nair, Mila Kunis and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz. Best film I can only take a Proustian dip into the best experiences I've had in and around certain films, as both Trash, interviewer and reviewer. Michael Haneke's Hidden; Abdellatif Kechiche's Couscous; Tran Anh Hung's At the Height of Summer; Claire Denis's 35 Shots of Rum; Shane Meadows's This is England; James Marsh's Man on Wire; Douglas Gordon's Zidane; Matteo Garrone's Gomorrah; the Coen brothers' A Serious Man; Clooney's Good Night, and Good Luck; Ken Loach's Looking for Eric (dinner with Cantona!); Fran\u00e7ois Ozon's Potiche (dinner with Catherine Deneuve!); Bruce Weber's Let's Get Lost, the signed poster for which sits in front of me now. Would like to thank\u2026 I have measured out my life in Trash. I met my wife on a one-night, 15-hour \"assignment\" in Ibiza, there and back to the premiere of It's All Gone Pete Tong; we had a La Dolce Vita-themed wedding (lucky I found a girl who didn't mind being up to her thighs in a fountain); I wrote of the birth of my first son Cy and his impending diet of black-and-white movies (how hopeful I was, before Dora the Explorer and Fireman Sam); my mother and grandmother have both made it into these pages. And to my dear cousin Amiee, with whom I stayed in LA while covering the Oscars and who was gutted she didn't get a mention next to Shirley Bassey in dispatches: hello Amiee! Thanks to the stars, directors, writers, execs and PRs who all gamely helped create and sustain 14 years of gossip on and off screen. Thanks to the editors, subs and lawyers who let me reveal the whispers from the other side of the red carpets and velvet ropes. My revels now are ended, at the Observer at least. I hope you enjoyed them even half as much as I did."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
