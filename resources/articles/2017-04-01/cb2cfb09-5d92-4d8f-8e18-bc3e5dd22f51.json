The man from Fresno often talked of liberating black people, facing discrimination as an African American man with a criminal record and the injustice of the \u201cwhite man holding us down\u201d. \u201cHe was just so angry \u2013 angry at the system,\u201d said Sharisse Kemp, a cousin who grew up alongside Muhammad. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t get the feeling he was a danger to himself or anyone.\u201d Kemp, 33, was sent into a state of shock on Tuesday when she got a call from her mother saying that police had accused Muhammad, 39, of fatally shooting three white men at random in downtown Fresno, California. He allegedly shouted \u201cGod is great\u201d in Arabic and said he wanted to kill as many white people as possible. The deadly rampage has made headlines across the globe, with some conservatives in the US labeling Muhammad a Muslim terrorist, blaming the Black Lives Matter movement and claiming that the media was failing to give the shooting the attention it deserves as an anti-white hate crime. But in Fresno, an agricultural community in the Central Valley three hours south of San Francisco, stunned relatives of the suspect said the tragedy stemmed from Muhammad\u2019s long battle with mental illness and his inability to get proper treatment and stabilize his life after a seven-year prison sentence. Police officials have said they have found no links to terrorism, and hate crime experts said the shooting appeared to follow a troubling trend in recent years of mentally ill shooters acting on their own and targeting victims by race. \u201cHe needed help,\u201d said Malvina Howard, Muhammad\u2019s aunt, in tears on Tuesday night. \u201cHe just gave up on whatever life he was living \u2026 Some people, their brains don\u2019t work right.\u201d Police said Muhammad shot 16 rounds in less than a minute. The victims were identified on Wednesday as 34-year-old Zackary David Randalls, who was an electric utility worker, and local men Mark James Gassett, 37, and David Martin Jackson, 58. Muhammad, who was arrested shortly after the shooting, is also a suspect in a separate fatal shooting of motel security guard Carl Williams, 25, on the night of 13 April. Muhammad served time in federal prison for drug offenses and a firearm possession charge, records show. He was previously diagnosed with some form of psychosis \u201cwith a substantial degree of paranoia\u201d, and a federal judge in 2005 said he was suffering from a \u201cmental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent\u201d, according to court documents. On social media, Muhammad recently posted #LETBLACKPEOPLEGO on multiple occasions, the Los Angeles Times reported. He also reportedly wrote about \u201cblack warriors\u201d and \u201cwhite devils\u201d and referenced black nationalism and the Nation of Islam. \u201cI don\u2019t know what was in his mind,\u201d said Muhammad\u2019s 81-year-old grandmother, who raised him, as she sat on Tuesday night in her living room, a short drive away from the crime scene. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard for me to think about what has happened and why \u2013 the why is the most important thing I would like to know.\u201d Her family requested that the Guardian not publish the grandmother\u2019s name for safety reasons, citing fears she could be targeted in Fresno or by rightwing social media users online who have been digging into Muhammad\u2019s history and calling him a terrorist. As a local news station blasted eyewitness testimony of the shooting on her television nearby, the grandmother described how mental illness runs in the family and how her grandson was drawn to Islam at a young age, eventually giving up the family last name and changing it to Muhammad. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand it,\u201d she said, noting that the family was not religious. The grandmother said that Muhammad\u2019s early interest in Islam in some ways helped him mature and avoid the wrong crowd as a teen. Muhammad has spoken about the challenges of growing up around gang violence in a public access TV show he produced in Fresno. \u201cHe was looking for a place to call home,\u201d said Howard, 54, noting that at one point as an adolescent, Muhammad started going to a Baptist church. \u201cI think he never really knew who he was.\u201d His relatives said when he was younger, he became involved in the Nation of Islam, which the Southern Poverty Law Center considers a hate group. But it wasn\u2019t clear what role the group played in his life while he was in prison and after his release in 2014. Incarceration, Kemp said, seemed to permanently change Muhammad for the worse. After prison, she noticed him suffering from what appeared to be hallucinations. \u201cHe was like a whole new person. He just wasn\u2019t mentally there.\u201d In addition to his anger about the racism he experienced \u2013 being followed around in stores, for example \u2013 Muhammad grew increasingly frustrated with how hard it was to find work and rebuild a life after prison. \u201cHe felt like he was being held back,\u201d his grandmother said, noting that he struggled to access mental healthcare. \u201cI think a lot of it is the system failed him.\u201d Howard recalled one instance of Muhammad asking to turn the television off, because he thought someone was talking to him through the device. She said the family didn\u2019t understand his mental illness and often felt helpless: \u201cHow do you talk about something with someone who doesn\u2019t think anything is wrong with him?\u201d Muhammad, who has three children, also has white friends and has dated white women, she added. On Sunday, days after police say Muhammad killed a motel security guard, he showed up to his grandmother\u2019s house in tears, which she said was unusual. \u201cHe was hugging me. He was crying.\u201d There has been a recent increase in hate crimes in the US, including a jump in homicides, according to Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. The Fresno shooting, he said, appeared to follow the pattern of lone shooters motivated by racial antipathy, such as the white supremacists who targeted a Sikh temple, Dylann Roof killing nine black church members and Micah Johnson shooting police officers in Dallas. \u201cThe ways these things are reported, it\u2019s as if there\u2019s some kind of a James Bond enemy factory that creates these mechanized people,\u201d said Levin. Instead, it\u2019s typically a \u201cboiling cauldron of mental illness and amplified anger that is then directed oftentimes by an amalgam of symbols and ideologies\u201d. While these shootings are often used to promote Islamophobia and demonize Black Lives Matter, statistics show that African Americans are still disproportionately victimized by hate crimes and that there has been a huge rise in attacks against Muslims in recent years. Research also suggests that the mentally ill are more likely to be victims of violence rather than perpetrators. Kemp said she felt it was wrong for the public or the media to blame the shooting on Islam. \u201cMy heart breaks for the families,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything we could say to make it OK, but we are truly sorry for their loss.\u201d At the grandmother\u2019s house on Tuesday, Muhammad\u2019s father declined to talk to a reporter, saying only: \u201cKori is going to prison for the rest of his life.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
