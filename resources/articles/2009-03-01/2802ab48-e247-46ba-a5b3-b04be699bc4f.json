It was clearly not the return O'Neill had in mind when, moments earlier, he reflected on the likelihood that Arsenal would overhaul Villa at some point over the coming weeks and claimed that his side would need to \"win a significant number\" of their remaining fixtures to finish in the top four. That task did not appear nearly so difficult a little under a fortnight ago when Villa were comfortably ahead at home against Stoke City and poised to open up a cavernous eight-point advantage over Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side. But the two late goals conceded that afternoon, followed by defeat at Manchester City three days later, mean that Arsenal have been presented with a window of opportunity that they can jump through with victory at home against Blackburn Rovers today. With Villa not hosting Tottenham Hotspur until tomorrow, three points would guarantee Arsenal fourth place for 24 hours at least and crank up the pressure on O'Neill and his players ahead of an unforgiving schedule that includes trips to Anfield and Old Trafford after taking on Spurs. With those fixtures in mind, O'Neill admitted that Villa's players have already accepted they may well find themselves involved in a game of catch-up with Arsenal as the season draws to a close. \"We don't kick-off until Sunday and we could be fifth by then,\" acknowledged the Villa manager, whose side are without a victory in six matches in all competitions. \"If you look at some of the fixtures that we have in the immediate future, they're exceptionally difficult. But we would still be hoping to be in a striking position for the last six or seven games of the season. It's in our hands [at the moment]. We've got a lot of tough fixtures. But [Tottenham] is so, so important to us.\" The Spurs manager, Harry Redknapp, has turned up the heat ahead of the trip to Villa Park by saying that he does not believe O'Neill's side will qualify for the Champions League. \"I think Villa will just miss out on the top four,\" Redknapp said yesterday. \"They have done very, very well and they're a good side, but Arsenal have got players coming back now, key players like [Theo] Walcott and [Cesc] F\u00e1bregas who will make the difference to them.\" O'Neill predicted Arsenal will be \"re-energised\" following their dramatic penalty shoot-out victory over Roma in midweek but he believes that his own players should also \"gain determination and energy from the fact that we are competing against the four English sides in the last eight of the Champions League\". A short break in Dubai should also have helped to galvanise the squad, with O'Neill confident that belief has not started to waver after a chastening run of results. \"It was a real setback losing two points against Stoke when we really had the game in our grasp and should have seen it through,\" said the Villa manager, who doubts that Martin Laursen will be fit for the trip to Manchester United on 5 April as initially hoped, after the central defender suffered a \"setback\" in his attempts to recovery from a troublesome knee injury. \"It's condensed into a 10-game season now and it's up to us,\" O'Neill added. \"We want to try and get ourselves going again at Villa Park and try and win a game.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
