In the five weeks since Bayliss was appointed by England\u2019s director of cricket, Andrew Strauss, the void has been filled by the ringing endorsements of those players who have worked under the 52-year-old Australian. Eoin Morgan, Mahela Jayawardene, Brendon McCullum and Brad Haddin \u2013 disciples of his regimes at Kolkata Knight Riders, Sri Lanka and New South Wales \u2013 have talked up his ability to empower cricketers by keeping their dressing room calm and delivering concise, considered messages without ever going down the route of hyperbole, or, as Morgan put it, \u201cbullshit\u201d. \u201cI keep things simple. At the top level it\u2019s about creating a good environment,\u201d Bayliss continued. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a good, honest, hard-working environment where players enjoy what they\u2019re doing, it allows them to go out with less pressure and show off the skills they\u2019ve got.\u201d These words could have been delivered by Paul Farbrace, who is reunited with Bayliss six years after their time together in the Sri Lanka set-up and who seemingly began the unshackling of England\u2019s cricketers while they awaited the permanent replacement to Peter Moores. \u201cHe will be my eyes and ears early on while I get to know the system and the players,\u201d said Bayliss, who admitted his old friend played a part in convincing him to up sticks from Sydney and start a new life in the mother country. \u201cHe is a good coach as well. I\u2019m very lucky to have him.\u201d The pair have been through more than just cricket together, of course, having both been on the team bus that was attacked by terrorists in Lahore in 2009 and saw six policemen and two civilians killed. \u201cI certainly remember when the bombs and the bullets were flying around,\u201d he said, while demonstrating he was just a matter of inches from being struck. \u201cThere was nothing you could do except keep your head down and your arse up.\u201d Bayliss admits that ordeal, along with the tragic death of the batsman Phillip Hughes last November when playing for South Australia against his New South Wales side, has shaped his outlook on life and keeps the cricket fully in perspective. Having left his dual roles in Australia and Kolkata following a \u00a3400,000-a-year offer from Strauss \u2013 an approach he neither courted nor expected having agreed contract extensions at both \u2013 Bayliss will not be joined by his wife and two children for at least 12 months because of his 17-year-old daughter\u2019s final year at school. Now, with a working visa secured, the former first-class batsman can familiarise himself with their new home and continue passing on a message of self-determination to his players that began during their four-day training camp in Spain over the weekend. \u201cOne of my philosophies is that the best coaches are the other 10 players in the team,\u201d he said. \u201cThe younger players look up to those older players and learn from them. If you\u2019re watching the right things, listening to those players, asking the right questions, you will learn more about the game actually competing than you will from any coach.\u201d Whether this player-led approach, the green shoots of which were evident against New Zealand, can bring about an Ashes victory this summer remains to be seen, with just seven days now until the first Test in Cardiff. Much has been made of his inside knowledge of Michael Clarke\u2019s tourists, with nine of his former charges in their 17-man touring party. Yet again, it comes down those who take the field. \u201cThere are enough guys in the England team with enough experience and who have played these guys plenty of times before,\u201d Bayliss said. How will he feel when the national anthems blare out at the Swalec Stadium just as the sledging-heavy pre-series hype turns into actual bat on ball action? \u201cI am old enough that in the first seven or eight years I was at school I sang God Save the Queen so I know most of the words and probably more than I do of our own at the moment,\u201d he joked. While Bayliss has worked with the one-day captain, Morgan, at Kolkata, his relationship with Test equivalent Alastair Cook is just days old. Asked if he rated his new ally\u2019s abilities as a leader, he replied: \u201cI\u2019ve not seen him up close or worked with him before. What I will say is that it is a lot easier from the captain\u2019s point of view if the team are playing a good, positive brand of cricket.\u201d And the overall objective? \u201cLike any other team worth their salt we want to be No1 in Test matches, ODIs and T20s. If you haven\u2019t got those aspirations I think you\u2019re kidding yourself.\u201d With a CV that includes two Sheffield Shields, two IPL titles, winning the Big Bash League at Sydney Sixers and two ICC limited-overs finals with Sri Lanka, success has followed everywhere Bayliss has worked. To make that hot streak to continue, England\u2019s players will be told to stand on their own two feet. There will be no spoon-feeding."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
