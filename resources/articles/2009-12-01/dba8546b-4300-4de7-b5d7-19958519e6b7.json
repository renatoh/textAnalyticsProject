The England Under-21 international, who was a target for Sunderland in the summer, has made only three appearances for Villa this season and will be allowed to leave the club for a fee of about \u00a33m. Birmingham and Wolves are both keen to sign the midfielder but Alex McLeish, who has a sizeable transfer kitty at his disposal, looks set to win the race."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
