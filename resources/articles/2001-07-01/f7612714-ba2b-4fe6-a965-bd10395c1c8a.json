Inamoto was paraded at Arsenal's London Colney training ground, with interest so intense that more than 100 members of the media from the Far East were present, a total which easily exceeded the televised unveilings of such high-profile Gunners signings as Sol Campbell and Thierry Henry. The Japanese, a 21-year-old defensive midfielder, was first spotted as a teenager by Ars\u00e8ne Wenger during the Highbury manager's days in the J-League and his transfer to the north London club will greatly enhance Arsenal's potential in the lucrative and rapidly expanding Far East market. Inamoto might not quite be in the David Beckham league, but his rusty-coloured moptop haircut is designed to make him instantly recognisable. He said: \"Blonds are supposed to stand out and that is why I have my hair this colour. I want to stand out on the pitch.\" His four-year deal starts with the baseball-loving Japanese international, capped 22 times, travelling with his new colleagues to their pre-season tour of Austria today, despite having played a full 90 minutes for his former club Gamba Osaka on Saturday. Wenger, who indicated this fifth capture of the summer would be his last before the Gunners' new assault on the title, said: \"I have seen a lot of Inamoto to know that he has the ability to become a very strong player and a real force in the Premiership. \"Having travelled in the other direction when I went to the J-League, I know it is very difficult when you move to another country. You have to be mentally very strong but Inamoto is a player who I saw at the recent Confederations Cup and I was very impressed with. \"I knew a little bit about him when I was in Japan but he has developed very well and I know we are buying a player of considerable talent.\" Inamoto will almost certainly miss the start of the Premiership season as he will be called up for Japan's friendly against Australia on August 15, three days before the big kick-off. His absence from Arsenal's opener at Middlesbrough underlines the fact that his marketing potential off the pitch may be just as important as his physical presence on it. Inamoto, who will probably play a small part in tomorrow's friendly against the Turkish side Kocaelispor near Innsbruck, said he is relishing the chance to pioneer Japanese football in the Premiership. \"There are a lot of players in Japan who have the qualities to play here but naturally I'm very proud to be the first one,\" he said. \"I need to work very hard on my game because the Premiership is a tough league which is watched all over Japan and, as such, I need to do well to stay in the national team.\" Inamoto will be joined in the Premiership by another Japanese international, the striker Akinori Nishizaw, who is on a 12-month loan to Bolton from Cerezo Osaka. Whether Inamoto plays alongside the unsettled Patrick Vieira at Arsenal remains to be seen, although the club's vice-chairman David Dein went to great lengths yesterday to insist the Vieira saga will soon be at an end. Dein made two points: \"Firstly, I want to make it clear that he is going to respect his contract at Arsenal, and the other is that he wishes to distance himself from comments attributed to him in the past. He will be an Arsenal player this season.\" Vieira was at the training ground yesterday but missed an ideal opportunity to express publicly his desire to stay at the club. But he did confirm that he will accompany his team-mates to Austria. Tottenham were poised to make their fifth signing of the summer as the Argentine defender Jose Antonio Chamot was completing a medical at White Hart Lane yesterday with a view to a free transfer from Milan. A Spurs spokesman said last night: \"Chamot will certainly not sign until at least Tuesday lunchtime as he has yet to complete a full medical. The player has agreed to the terms offered, so there should be no problem with the move going ahead\". Chamot, 32, a veteran of the 1994 and 1998 World Cup s, has agreed a two-year deal. The central defender, who has 44 caps, was previously with Atletico Madrid and Lazio. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
