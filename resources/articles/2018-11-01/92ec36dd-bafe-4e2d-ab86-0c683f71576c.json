They can\u2019t afford to eat\u2019", "bodyText": "Idir Ghanes, 42 Unemployed computer technician from Paris We are here to protest against the government because of the rise in taxes [in general], not just petrol taxes, which is the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. We\u2019ve had enough. We have low salaries and pay too much tax and the combination is creating more and more poverty. On the other side, there are government ministers and the president with their fabulous salaries. I\u2019m not against the rich, I just want a fairer distribution of wealth in France. This is the first time I\u2019ve been on a protest. I\u2019m unemployed; it\u2019s harder and harder to find a job and, even when you find this famous job and you think your life will improve, the salaries are so low you find you\u2019re in the same situation as before, if not worse. At the last election, I left the ballot paper blank. I don\u2019t have confidence in any of the political parties and I don\u2019t see that changing until a party emerges that is more interested in the people than in those with huge fortunes. It\u2019s unacceptable that people do not have decent salaries, that at the end of the month, they are in the red and can\u2019t afford to eat. Florence, 55 Works for an air freight company outside Paris We tell them our concerns and we elect them, then when they get into power they seem astonished when we come out on the streets like today to protest. It\u2019s as if the protests have just fallen from the sky, when we\u2019ve already told them how we feel. Above all, President Macron has not listened to the ordinary French and doesn\u2019t understand the concerns of their daily lives. When he appears on television we have the impression he is uncomfortable with normal people, that there is a certain contempt for us. I didn\u2019t vote for him. I haven\u2019t voted for a while. When I did, I would describe myself as moderate right, centre right. Bruno Binelli, 66 Retired carpenter from Lyon We left just after midnight to come here today. There are so many things we are fed up with. We work, we pay taxes, but it\u2019s all too much. To give you an example; my aunt died recently and left \u20ac40,000. She worked all her life, she paid her taxes and charges, but the government took 60% of that. Does that seem fair? I\u2019m not in any political party. I often vote Front National but I\u2019m not Front National. It\u2019s not my mentality and, besides, I\u2019m Italian by origin, but I do it out of protest to say things are not good and if you continue like this we will end up with electing someone from the extreme right. But they don\u2019t listen to us. Macron listens to nothing. He\u2019s suddenly concerned about ecology but it\u2019s a lie, it\u2019s a pretext to make us pay more tax. We no longer know what kind of car to buy, petrol, diesel, electric, who knows? I have a little diesel van and I don\u2019t have the money to buy a new one, especially as I\u2019m about to retire. We have the feeling those from the countryside are forgotten. Marie Lemoine, 62 School teacher from Provins I came here in a car share to save money and to not pollute the planet even more. We gilets jaunes (yellow vests) represent the poor of France, those they call the sans-dents (toothless), those with modest or low incomes, who are being crushed. If you live in the countryside you have to have a car to get to work, so we are directly affected when fuel prices go up and up. And when the electricity bill goes up and up, and the gas bill, and the charges and taxes, it\u2019s hard to bear. We feel we are being targeted instead of the airlines, the shipping lines, those companies who pollute more but pay no tax. Personally, I have the means to get by, but I know many people who cannot and I\u2019m here for them. I\u2019m here for my children and grandchildren and all those people left crying by the 15th of the month because they\u2019ve gone into the red. I\u2019m not right or left, I\u2019m a gilet jaune. We\u2019re not here to make a political party point. Most of us are pacifists and don\u2019t want to fight. We are just normal people who are fed up. I voted for Mr Macron last year, but I feel betrayed and I\u2019m angry. I was wrong. Macron is our Louis XVI, and we know what happened to him. He ended up at the guillotine. Marc Mouilleseaux, 24 History and geography teacher at the lyc\u00e9e in Creil I\u2019m fortunate as I\u2019m a public servant, so I\u2019m not complaining about pay. I\u2019m here for others in my family who are having difficulties, like my grandmother who has been hit hard by the new tax on pensions. I also know people who wanted to come to the demonstration in Paris today to protest about the tax on petrol but can\u2019t because they cannot afford the petrol. But it\u2019s not just that, it\u2019s an accumulation of things. The fuel tax was just the final straw. I don\u2019t hold out much hope that Macron will listen to us and I\u2019m quite resigned to that. All we can do is show that people are angry, that they are not alone and that they can do something about it. I hope there is no violence, but people are angry. I can understand why, for years they have voted for things and nothing has changed for them. They don\u2019t see a way out. But things have to change. I am a member of Debout la France (a rightwing party) so I\u2019m involved in politics. I voted for Marine Le Pen in the second round of the presidential election, but only because, for me, she was the least bad option."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
