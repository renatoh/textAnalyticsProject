The majority were used to ferry late night revellers back to their accomodation at break-neck speeds. To actually rent a motorbike wasn't possible in Santiago unless one befriended a bike-owning santiaguerran who would gladly loan you the use of their vehicle for a small charge. Alternatively, there is a mechanic by the huge statue of Antonio Machado in Plaza de la Revolucion, which may be able to offer some help. Be aware that as a result of the lack of replacement parts, vehicles in general are often kept running by the resourcefulness of the owner or local mechanic. I did hear that in Havana some of the larger hotels were able to offer some sort of hire service. William Ellis"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
