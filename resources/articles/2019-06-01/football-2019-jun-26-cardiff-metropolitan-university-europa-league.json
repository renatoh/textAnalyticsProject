He needs to put the players through their paces, wash some kit, pack another couple of strips into his VW transporter van, finish his academic work and then remember to settle the bill for the spaghetti bolognese he has pre-ordered for a party of 40 the next day. \u201cI\u2019ve received 14 phonecalls just since we\u2019ve been chatting,\u201d says Edwards, shaking his head and smiling at the madness of it all. Edwards is the former Swansea City, Nottingham Forest and Bristol Rovers defender in charge of Cardiff Met, who will become the first British University men\u2019s side to play in European competition when they take on Progr\u00e8s Niederkorn in Luxembourg on Thursday. The students beat Bala Town in the Welsh Premier League play-offs last month to take their place in the preliminary round of the Europa League, creating a little bit of history in the process and putting a fresh slant on the phrase \u201cintelligent footballers\u201d. \u201cThe squad used to be top heavy with undergraduates,\u201d says Edwards. \u201cThese days we\u2019re top heavy with PhDs and postgraduate students and then a small amount of undergraduate students, so for a footballing university team we\u2019re very experienced. Some players are approaching 300 games for the team. And we\u2019ve got varying backgrounds. Two of our players came from the professional game, one has captained Hereford at Wembley, and then you\u2019ve got some boys who have never been at an academy in their lives \u2013 we\u2019ve got five farmers from the west.\u201d Their success is quite a story and, in fairness, one that should be framed around Edwards being described as much more than an ex-footballer, mindful of the fact that since retiring from the professional game in July 2006, the 43-year-old has gone on to gain a first-class honours degree at undergraduate level, a distinction in his masters and a PhD. Edwards spent four years on the latter and his doctoral work \u2013 \u201cexamining the sociological significance of humour and how it is used as a critical component in the negotiation of coaching relationships\u201d \u2013 means far more to him than representing his country and everything that came with his career as a footballer, including the David Beckham, Alan Shearer and Fernando Redondo shirts that are packed away somewhere in his loft. \u201cI\u2019ve got senior Welsh caps, played in the Premier League etc, but that [the PhD] is the best thing I\u2019ve ever done, because I wasn\u2019t expected to succeed in education,\u201d Edwards says. Edwards certainly did not expect to return to football after hanging up his boots and enrolling as a student at Cardiff Met. He had been spending his spare time watching rugby when he answered a call for help. \u201cThe chief executive of the student union, Mike Davies, said they were going to pull the football programme because it was pointless, and asked if I fancied taking over,\u201d recalls Edwards. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really interested in the football team and didn\u2019t even know what level they played at. So I looked and we were at the bottom, the armpit of Welsh football. But they said they\u2019d pay my masters fees, so it was a case of \u2018Where do I sign?\u2019\u201d A decade on and as well as having \u201cDr\u201d before his name \u2013 something that caused confusion with one former Forest teammate who wondered whether the Welshman was now in a position to sort out knee problems \u2013 Edwards has a total of five promotions on his CV, just about every coaching qualification going and is totally immersed in the role. He earns his living in the lecture theatre; managing the football team is voluntary and none of the players get paid either. In fact, the students hand over \u00a3150 to cover the annual membership fee. \u201cWe\u2019ve survived off loyalty from the players. And I\u2019m loyal to them,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cI don\u2019t get paid for the football. My role is as a senior lecturer [in sports coaching science]. Like the rest of the players, I could probably work elsewhere and get X amount per week but I wouldn\u2019t get the same enjoyment, buzz and fulfilment. Whereas at most places it\u2019s about entitlement.\u201d A principled man who \u201cdoesn\u2019t do egos\u201d, Edwards put a rule in place from day one that anyone playing for the university has to be either a student or alumni. On top of that, he expects his team to deliver \u2013 and not just on the pitch. \u201cIf I find out they\u2019re not in classes, they\u2019re in trouble, they know that. But then the dressing room looks after that. No one would dare come in and say they had a 45 or a 50. Come in and say you got a 65 or a 70, yeah. That\u2019s the work ethic the boys have. They\u2019re embarrassed to get a poor mark.\u201d It is tempting to wonder what their opponents in Luxembourg make of it all. Edwards is hoping that there may be a little bit of complacency. \u201cI think they\u2019ll be at the level of our champions, TNS. We played them on Friday, deliberately so for the mindset to be right. We know it\u2019s going to be a hard test for us. But they may well underestimate students.\u201d Whatever the outcome over the two legs, Cardiff Met are guaranteed \u00a3193,000 in prize money for reaching this stage and although none of that will end up in the pockets of the staff or students involved, Edwards has been turning a few ideas over in his mind. \u201cI think we need to sit down and look at how we can reward the players\u2019 loyalty,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat that looks like, I don\u2019t know. Maybe we get a holiday next year as a group.\u201d Perhaps a trip to Las Vegas? \u201cMaybe not Vegas,\u201d says Edwards, looking a little taken aback at that suggestion. \u201cMaybe the Mumbles.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
