Please do not add spoilers from later episodes. This felt like exactly the right time for a full flashback episode. Obviously anyone who has read the book knows there are still interesting developments to come back at the Waterford residence. But after last week\u2019s revelation about Luke, I\u2019m glad we actually get to see his journey since that fateful ambush in the first episode. This is the handmaid\u2019s tale and hers alone, but the wife\u2019s tale (last week) and the husband\u2019s this week are welcome embellishments. When we first left Luke at the side of the road, cowering by the family\u2019s crashed Volvo, we followed June and Hannah into the woods. This week we see Luke\u2019s valiant one-man resistance and his The Fugitive-style escape from the back of that crashed ambulance. In the quiet chaos following the vehicle\u2019s spectacular roll down the river bank, Luke takes what he needs, stuffs his bag full of pain relief and one of the guardian\u2019s guns and flees. Slowly. The unbearable tension of suppressed rage, hidden from view, is replaced this week by the unbearable tension that ensues when the suppressed break cover and run. Both are equally hard to watch, but I found myself missing the muted turquoises and creams of the Waterford\u2019s house. This isn\u2019t me saying that the Nazis ran a really efficient train service; I have just grown to admire the order and colour coordination of the Gilead architects. They\u2019re fascists, but tasteful ones. Back in the time before (which we now know is three years prior to the present-day action), Luke and Hannah flee with their drugged daughter \u2013 Benadryl antihistamine to ensure she doesn\u2019t give them away \u2013 helped by a man who will later pay for his complicity with his life. Lying on the abandoned kitchen floor after his escape, a wounded Luke is rudely awoken by some angry women in beanies . Once they\u2019ve established he\u2019s only wearing the a guardian\u2019s jacket and is really on their side, Luke is scooped up and given medical treatment. He has found salvation, or rather, it has found him. Before you know it, he\u2019s living in Canada, seemingly close to one of the women, Zoe, he met in the van and free of Gilead. For the time being anyway. When Luke insists that he must head back to Boston to find his family, one beanie woman (sadly also RIP by episode\u2019s end) shows Luke inside a nearby church in which the rafters are hung with dead bodies of those who tried to rebel. He gags on the smell and agrees that perhaps he should go to Canada with them to regroup and get clear of the danger. In present-day Toronto, we finally see Luke heading for the official-looking building where he will receive the never-hoped-for message from June, hastily scribbled and handed over before the Mexicans left the Waterford house that morning. Luke walks down a municipal corridor lined with posters of the missing, hundreds of them. An official invites him into an oak-panelled meeting room and hands him an envelope pertaining to one June Osbourne. His face says he\u2019s expecting confirmation of her death but the envelope contains that same scrap of note paper she held at the end of last week\u2019s episode. The thought of even that connection between them is thrilling considering the intervening years. In a direct mirror of last week\u2019s ending, the camera homes in on Luke\u2019s face, the tears coming as it sinks in. She\u2019s alive. He is overcome. In the most judicial edit of the episode, we cut back to Offred sitting in profile in her room, looking more like June than ever despite the handmaid cowl and smock. She says in her head, \u201cI love you. Save Hannah\u201d and I am a mess of parental blubbering. If you aren\u2019t rooting for this little family by now, you\u2019re a lump of sentient clay or Donald Trump or both. To the sound of Nothing\u2019s Gonna Hurt You Baby by Cigarettes After Sex we leave Luke and June locked into each other, despite the distance. Hope reigns. Blessed be the fruit. May the Lord open. Under his eye \u2022 Finding his daughter\u2019s shoe in the forest, Luke clings to it desperately, impotent with fury, unable to save his people. It\u2019s too awful. \u2022 The ruined town where an injured Luke hides out is covered in graffiti telling us what has already happened here. \u201cGender traitor\u201d slogans are sprayed on walls and doors. Everything is smashed. The initial push to seize power has been brutal. \u2022 When Luke calls Offred \u201cJune-bug\u201d in the trunk of the car, it\u2019s shattering, knowing this break for freedom will fail. Their relationship is perfectly foregrounded so that closing shot of Luke has full impact. \u2022 Luke\u2019s \u201cWho are you guys?\u201d to the people in the van is met with a grinned, \u201cTwo straights, a gay and a nun,\u201d from the kind-looking man in thick-rimmed glasses. God, I was glad of the humour by this point. \u2022 I don\u2019t know if I can take another series of this tense awfulness but also, I can\u2019t bear for it to end in just three more instalments. I need June and Luke to find each other again, but I will riot if episode 10 ends with this. Conflicted isn\u2019t the word."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
