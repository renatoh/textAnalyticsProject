Instead, it has maintained a constant following, albeit one that rests in the background of the gaming spectrum. Which presents developers with a challenge. How should their 2D shooters innovate in a well-served market? The team behind XType Plus has opted to mix the dense \"bullet curtains\" of Japanese arcade shooters with the twin-stick controls as modelled by Geometry Wars, while also focusing exclusively on boss battles, presenting the player with increasingly aggressive space leviathans. On the whole it's a good effort. Two modes \u2013 a classic arcade arrangement and time-trial version \u2013 are certainly engrossing and backed by polished visuals and luscious sound. But what XType Plus lacks is the depth of scoring and variety of bullet patterns that really provide hours of gameplay. A well-produced treat, then, especially for a pocket-change price, but one that falls short of the genre's finest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
