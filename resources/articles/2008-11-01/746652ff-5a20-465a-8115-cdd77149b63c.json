Insiders predict that British racecourses could follow suit and one track admitted that such an arrangement has already been considered. \"Other [racecourses] may have been a bit gun shy, but now we are going first, I am sure others will follow,\" said Warren Brown, chief executive of Melbourne Racing Club, announcing the deal, which is reportedly worth a seven-figure sum in Australian dollars. John Holmes, owner of Great Leighs, Britain's newest racecourse, confirmed that he had toyed with selling the naming rights to his track. \"This [news] does not surprise us,\" he said. \"We have been exploring this type of opportunity for a long time. It has always been our intention to think outside the box. \"At Great Leighs, we are extremely excited about new opportunities and we have been in discussion about such for the past few months, though at this point we are governed by non-disclosure agreements.\" One of Newmarket's two courses is sponsored and journalists are encouraged to refer to it as the Natwest Rowley Mile, so the addition of branding to a course's name would not be unprecedented. But the replacement of a course's name with the sponsor's, a more effective arrangement from the sponsor's perspective, would be much more controversial. Michael Harris, chief executive of the Racehorse Owners' Association, argued that such a deal should be off-limits for high-profile tracks. \"In our current economic climate, we have to go after every penny,\" he said, \"but if Sandown in Surrey gave up its name for a sponsor, would it not cause racing to lose something very special? \"I think it would, in the same way that, if a Group One race loses its identity, racing overall loses something. If the King George, which hasn't got a sponsor now, became the Coca-Cola Stakes, that would be appalling - even if Coca-Cola put in \u00a31m, it would be appalling. If you sell out completely for commerce, you lose something that is rich and nostalgic and part of the fabric of racing.\" But Harris conceded it might be appropriate for courses like Southwell and Wolverhampton, whose function is largely to provide action for the betting shops, to sell their naming rights to a sponsor, whose name would then appear in national newspapers every time a race-meeting was staged. The Racecourse Association offered a cautious welcome to the development. \"I wouldn't discourage people from coming forward, offering large sums of money,\" said chief executive Stephen Atkin. \"I suspect that racecourses would welcome being put in that predicament - but the sums involved would have to be substantial. \"You have to take your hat off to Betfair for their ingenuity but the identity of a racecourse is very valuable, not least in terms of letting people know how to get there.\" As an example of the perils of selling naming rights, Atkin referred to the history of the football team Llansantffraid FC, which played as Total Network Solutions for nine years before its sponsorship deal ended. Having achieved some limited fame as TNS, the club has since changed its name to The New Saints. Atkin had particular concerns about a racecourse giving up its name in exchange for a bookmaker's. \"It would be highly likely to put off a lot of sponsors,\" he pointed out. \"Obviously, you wouldn't get any of the other bookmakers sponsoring there and there are other sponsors who don't like racing's relationship with betting to be too 'in your face'. \"But we live in a capitalist society and I see no reason why people shouldn't come forward with this sort of proposition. It's not the sort of thing you could go looking for because then people think you're hawking it around, but if the opportunity arose, I think people would look at it.\" That was confirmed by Julie Harrington, group operations director of Northern Racing, which owns nine racecourses, including Chepstow and Newcastle. Northern would happily contemplate such a deal, she said, \"if we can find the right commercial partner\". \"People like Emirates [Airline], you can imagine a racecourse partnership with someone like that,\" she added. \"In the next year, in the current economic climate, I should imagine most sponsors will be working with existing partners. But certainly in the next five years, I could see a racecourse selling their naming rights.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
