Beckham was expected to start on the bench but manager Carlo Ancelotti named the midfielder in his starting lineup. Mirko Vucinic's 22nd minute goal allowed the hosts to head into the dressing room ahead at half-time but two quick goals from Alexandre Pato, who scored twice within eight minutes in the second half, allowed Milan to turn the scoreline around. However, Vucinic struck again in the 73rd minute to level the game and leave Milan in third position, nine points behind league leaders Inter. Beckham, who was used on the right-hand side of a midfield three alongside Clarence Seedorf and Andrea Pirlo, played a largely defensive role in the first half. It was only in the second that he moved further forwards, sending crosses into the Roma area. The on-loan LA Galaxy midfielder was eventually replaced in the 89th minute by former Arsenal player Mathieu Flamini."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
