Instant messaging wasn't new, but ICQ was viewed by many as the best of breed at the time. Mirabilis was spending considerable amounts of cash to build its burgeoning user base and keep the servers running smoothly. Its main investor, Yossi Vardi, was asked how the company was planning to make money. He half-jokingly declared, in a line that became famous: \"Revenue is a distraction.\" And Vardi's endgame wasn't to get money from users. It was to sell the company \u2013 and in 1998 AOL, heading toward the peak of its own market capitalization, bought Mirabilis for $400m. On Monday, another fast-growing service that needed just one customer pulled off a similar coup. Instagram, a mobile-oriented photo-sharing service, sold itself to Facebook for \"approximately $1bn in a combination of cash and shares of Facebook.\" When you see a vague description of this kind, you should assume that the vast majority of the purchase price came in stock, not cash. Even so, this deal is a major one for Silicon Valley and the technology business in general, for all kinds of reasons. Technology journalist and entrepreneur (and friend) Om Malik thinks the deal makes sense, and his view is gaining wide currency: Facebook was scared shitless and knew that for first time in its life it arguably had a competitor that could not only eat its lunch, but also destroy its future prospects. Why? Because Facebook is essentially about photos, and Instagram had found and attacked Facebook's achilles heel \u2014 mobile photo sharing. Perhaps so. Certainly the deal makes a certain amount of sense if Facebook is becoming an unregulated monopoly like your local electricity company. To the extent that Facebook is succeeding in its bid to become an alternative web, where it controls the ecosystem rather than existing as part of the wider open web, it can afford to spend any amount of money to buy what amounts to a feature. But there's another way to think about this deal, too, and it summons other lessons from the ICQ era. Back then, AOL was also surging in value, with cashflow increasing rapidly. It saw ICQ as a must-have feature for its own service, and paid what at the time was a staggering amount. In 2000, AOL \"bought\" Time Warner. I put that word in quotes because the acquisition relied on inflated AOL stock, just before the era's tech bubble burst. The Time executives who made this deal were stunningly clueless about the internet (and in most cases that doesn't appear to have changed a great deal), and they royally mistreated their shareholders. The strategy Vardi (also a friend) employed for Mirabilis was sound, but could ICQ have commanded such a price a few years later? Not likely. It's tempting, today, to believe that Facebook's buyout of Instagram signals the eventual end of the current technology bubble. (As in the last one, of course, all kinds of brilliant people are insisting that no such thing exists at the moment; I'll be happy to be proved wrong.) But circumstances also suggest that today's bubble, assuming we're in one, has room to expand. The main reason is the recently passed Jobs Act that, as noted recently, is ostensibly designed to fuel entrepreneurship in America but which is at least as likely to promote corporate fraud. Silicon Valley loves the law, but the scam artists of the world are surely salivating, too. When a flood of sleaze adds to a rising tide, all boats float higher \u2013 for a time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
