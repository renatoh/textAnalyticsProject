The England centre-half is currently considering his future, having met Venables on Sunday after returning from a short break in Nice. Ferdinand emerged from that meeting stressing that he was faced with \"a huge dilemma\" and had \"the toughest decision\" of his life ahead of him, but it seems increasingly likely that the 23-year-old will take his first step towards following Lee Bowyer out of Elland Road by telling Leeds officials he wants to leave. Though Sir Alex Ferguson has yet to table a bid for his chief summer transfer target, sources close to Ferdinand confirmed last night that the former West Ham defender's heart is set upon moving to Old Trafford. While the meeting with Venables was constructive - \"I feel Leeds will achieve things with him in charge,\" said Ferdinand - it did not do enough to change the defender's mind. It may only be 20 months since Leeds paid \u00a318m for his services, but his barnstorming displays at the World Cup whetted Ferdinand's appetite with the desire for silverware and Champions League football. The centre-half currently earns \u00a330,000 a week at Elland Road and has four years remaining on his contract, but would be prepared to forgo a \u00a31m loyalty bonus to move over the Pennines, where he should be able to double his wages. A fee in the region of \u00a330m would at least relieve the financial pressures on Leeds, though that would be scant consolation for their fans at the sight of their talismanic captain leaving for their arch rivals. A potential move for Valencia's Roberto Ayala, ironically another target for Manchester United, as a replacement would do little to appease them. The exodus from Elland Road should already be underway by the time Ferdinand tells the chairman Peter Ridsdale of his decision, with Bowyer edging closer to completing his protracted \u00a39m transfer to Anfield. The 25-year-old former Charlton midfielder spent yesterday discussing personal terms and undergoing a medical at Liverpool's Melwood training complex. Though negotiations took longer than expected - \"The position at the moment is that talks with the player are still ongoing,\" confirmed a spokesman last night - G\u00e9rard Houllier will resume talks today in an attempt to complete the deal before Liverpool leave for a pre-season tour of France. All being well, the controversial midfielder should then make his debut in Friday's friendly against Le Havre."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
