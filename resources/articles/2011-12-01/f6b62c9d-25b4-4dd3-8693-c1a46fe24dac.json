With a tip of the hat to the rapper LL Cool J, author of that declarative couplet, Tiger Woods embarked on the next phase of his career on Sunday after winning a tournament for the first time in more than two years. The former world No1 holed a six-foot putt on the final hole of the Chevron World Challenge in California to beat Zach Johnson by a shot and reacted like he had just unlocked the secret of cold nuclear fusion. \"It feels normal. I know it's been a while, but also for some reason it feels like it hasn't. It's pretty funny because one of my buddies texted me this morning [with] an old LL Cool J lyric: 'Don't call it a comeback; I been here for years,'\" Woods said after the victory, which earned him $1.2m, a prize he donated to his charitable foundation, and lifted him to 21st in the world rankings. Not for the first time in his career, the most famously obtuse athlete in the world was being more than a little coy. The victory was more than normal, being greeted around the world as the second coming of a fallen idol. Woods is back, declared the headlines from Hong Kong to San Jose and back. Clearly, the resurrection tale never goes out of fashion. These past two years have been torrid for Woods, who has suffered the greatest fall since Icarus. He has endured the embarrassment and humiliation of a sex scandal. His personal life has fallen apart, along with his marriage and his carefully nurtured (over the course of a decade) public image. Once untouchable on the golf course, he becomes trapped in the body of Joe Blow, PGA Tour journeyman \u2013 a middle-of-the-pack fixture more often than not. There have been moments over that time when he threatened to recapture the form that won him 82 tournaments around the world, including 14 major championships. He managed three top-five finishes in the majors and would have won the Chevron event last year but for two sensational putts on the closing holes by Graeme McDowell, who edged him out in a play-off. This time, it was Woods who made the shots when it counted most. He held a two-shot lead heading into the back nine but was one behind standing over a 15-foot birdie putt on the 17th hole. He holed that, and then on the final hole hit a nine-iron approach to within six feet, and rolled in the putt for a winning birdie. \"People don't realise how hard it is to win golf tournaments. I've gone on streaks where I've won golf tournaments in a row, but still \u2026 I don't think I've taken it for granted. And I know because of how hard it is,\" he said. Woods, as he has often done at the high points of his career, spoke again about the influence of his late father, Earl. \"He would be proud of the way I hung in and was grinding, the way I was staying focused on what I was doing. I didn't let anything get in the way of my shot selection and commitment to each shot and the shot shape I was going to play,\" he said. \"When he was alive that was something he was always kind of harping on at me. No matter whether you play the right shot or not, at least be committed to it. I was very committed to each and every shot, whether it was going to end great or not.\" For all the euphoria, both from Woods himself and from the wider golf community, which is clearly happy to have its biggest \"name\" back in the winner's circle, a note of caution must be sounded. The Chevron World Challenge may carry the imprimatur of a PGA Tour event but it is nobody's idea of a seriously meaningful tournament. The field was limited to 18 players and many of them seemed more preoccupied with getting home to their families after a long season than with chasing victory. The real test for Woods will come next month when he travels to the Middle East to play in the Abu Dhabi Championship, where he will face Europe's leading players, including the world No1 Luke Donald, as well as Lee Westwood and Rory McIlroy, both of whom won at the weekend, in South Africa and Hong Kong respectively. If Woods wins against a field of such quality then it might be time to give the old Sid Waddell line an airing. The greatest comeback since Lazarus?
