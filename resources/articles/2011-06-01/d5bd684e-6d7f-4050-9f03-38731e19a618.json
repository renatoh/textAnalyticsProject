If Diego Benaglio deserved credit for blocking after Bent had been sent scurrying through by Jack Wilshere, then there was little excuse for the shot skewed over an empty net late on. \"Fabio told me: 'Don't worry about it,'\" Bent said. \"All strikers miss chances, and today it wasn't meant to be.\" His previous progress, and the weight of goals he manages in the Premier League, should not be ignored, but one wonders whether Bent will be first choice if all other contenders are fit and available. Wayne Rooney will clearly stroll back into this team, but Andy Carroll's progress early next season at Liverpool will be intriguing. If he flourishes, then Bent could be reduced to bit-part role again. 2 Jack Wilshere really is a senior player This was only a second competitive start for Wilshere but, already, he seems key to England's progress. The 19-year\u2011old's dynamism thrust the hosts back into contention, Johan Djourou curtailing his weaving run to earn the first-half penalty from which England got back into the game. There were clever runs and passes, through balls for the forward and delivery to the wider players. It was the teenager who coaxed and created offering real hope for the future, while players such as Frank Lampard, who rather plodded through and was substituted at half-time, may now see their opportunities start to dwindle. Wilshere's decision to miss the Under-21 tournament has divided opinion, but he appeared to tire towards the end, justifying that stance. If he is fresh and fit at the start of next season, he will be integral to the senior side. Wilshere himself suggested he will have to regain his place once Steven Gerrard returns, but space will surely be made to incorporate both. It is his guile and drive around which this team should be built. 3 Fabio Capello picked the wrong team The omission of Ashley Young, who had impressed against Denmark, Wales and Ghana, from the start was baffling, particularly given that Capello had name-checked the Aston Villa forward in the buildup as a player who had impressed him in training. The manager's assertion post-match that life on the wing was not suited to the 25-year-old was rather dispiriting; the inevitable second-half cameo, sparked by the equalising goal, had offered a reminder of his qualities and England had needed his slippery intent from the start, whether that was in central or wider areas. But could Young be incorporated in this team behind a lone forward if Rooney, Gerrard and Carroll were fit? Capello, invariably, is cautious when it comes to selection and James Milner's inclusion suggested that much. But ignoring Young's credentials from the start was mystifying. \"The manager told me to go out and play as I have been recently and had been in training,\" said the forward, \"and that's what I did.\" The Villa player will go into talks with his club owner, Randy Lerner, this week having earned a man of the match award for his country as a second-half substitute. His suitors will have taken note. 4 The players made basic errors It would be churlish to blame Capello for the basic defensive errors that undermined England's display against the Swiss. The hosts had already been pulled out of position too often by the time Tranquillo Barnetta ended his 32-match scoreless sequence at this level with two messy goals from free-kicks within three minutes. Rio Ferdinand, back for only his third international appearance in a little over a year, was bypassed for the first, with Joe Hart slow to react on his line. James Milner's wandering from a two\u2011man defensive wall moments later allowed the midfielder to fizz in the second at the goalkeeper's near post. \"I thought they were going to take it short so I moved, but it gave Harty no chance,\" Milner said. \"That was poor, no excuses.\" There were other alarming moments, with the Swiss finishing the stronger side and coming close to restoring their lead. This was only the second time in 22 home games that England have conceded more than once, but there was a vulnerability that was disturbing, and Capello should not be considered culpable for inexplicable errors from experienced performers. 5 A sense of realism is required Perhaps those kind of mistakes should be expected these days. England are in a transitional period: the Football Association may want to look long term, but the manager's focus remains very much short term, with his own tenure entering its final year. Capello has some senior players with time against them, plenty of whom may see their chances dwindle leading up to the 2012 tournament in Poland and Ukraine. Lampard and Ferdinand are among them, players who retain their class but whose powers may be on the wane. Yet their replacements \u2013 whether youngsters such as Wilshere or older players still finding their feet at this level \u2013 will be prone to the odd error as they grow used to life in the England bubble. For example, Hart's uncharacteristic mistakes, and snarl at a television camera as he departed the turf at half-time, were a reality check. Next season will provide a test of the new breed's mental fortitude as much as their qualities on the field."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
