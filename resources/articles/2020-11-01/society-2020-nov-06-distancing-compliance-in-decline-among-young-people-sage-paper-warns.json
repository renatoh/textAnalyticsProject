The paper, by the behavioural scientists\u2019 group and considered by Sage on 22 October, recommended that university teaching should immediately go completely online and that schools should give out free face coverings. \u201cYoung people asked to isolate or stay at home should be provided with good financial and other support eg free mobile phone data, streaming and gaming,\u201d it says. According to work from University College London, complete compliance among young people was nearly 60% in early April, but down to 20-30% by late September. That compares with 40-45% of 30- to 50-year-olds and 50-55% in the over-60s. Young people\u2019s jobs, education and living conditions may all make it more difficult for them to stick to the rules, the paper says. They are more likely to work in jobs with high numbers of social contacts, for instance, and being at university or college makes it harder to keep apart. \u201cYoung people are more likely to live in all-adult, crowded, multi-occupancy housing, often with poor ventilation which may further contribute to rapid transmission,\u201d says the paper. But taking risks is often an important part of young people\u2019s identity, and only 60% \u2013 less than any other age group \u2013 have confidence in the government\u2019s measures for controlling the pandemic. They are also more likely to have had depression in the pandemic, with around a third reporting severe depressive symptoms. The main aim of the paper was to help get messages to young people about the need to cut down on social contact and comply with isolation rules. Instead of instructing them on what to do, the best approach is to \u201cemphasise what other peers are doing\u201d, says the paper. \u201cCommunication interventions that explicitly target young people risk defining them as the problem and thereby alienating them.\u201d In early September the health secretary, Matt Hancock, delivered a grim warning to young people not to \u201ckill granny\u201d by taking the virus home. The paper urges the use of non-government sources such as charities, celebrities, sports clubs and commercial brands to get messages to young people, who need accurate information, for instance about wearing masks and the risks to their loved ones. Young people are strongly oriented towards their peer group, the paper says. They should be encouraged to care for each other but also made aware of the risk of infection among their friends."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
