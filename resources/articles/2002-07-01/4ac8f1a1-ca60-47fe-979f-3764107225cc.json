I certainly expect a Ferrari one-two here.\" Coulthard's impressive performance can be attributed in part to the excellent performance of his Michelin tyres in the oppressive 26C (79F) here at the Circuit de Nevers. Michael Schumacher, who leads the standings on 86 points, is assured of the championship so long as he wins and neither his team-mate Rubens Barrichello (32) nor Williams' Juan Pablo Montoya (31) finishes second. Should Montoya finish second he would be 59 points behind with 60 points available in the remaining six races, his hopes over in everything but theory. Barrichello would have a deficit of 58 points if he finished second tomorrow. Montoya, although his season is all but lost, is unimpressed at the prospect of Schumacher matching Juan Manuel Fangio's record of five world titles, proclaiming that neither heritage nor statistics means much to him as he battles to establish a reputation as a grand prix winner. Schumacher starts tomorrow's 12th round of the world championship poised to equal the achievements of the legendary Argentinian driver, who raced in formula one from 1949-58. Yet for the Colombian it would add nothing to Schumacher's celebrity status, and he continues to regard the Ferrari team leader as nothing more than another rival to be beaten in wheel-to-wheel competition. Montoya, who mesmerised the crowds 13 days ago at Silverstone where he battled for the lead against Schumacher in the opening stages of the British grand prix, also believes that the German is far from unbeatable. \"There is no secret to this business,\" he said. \"You work to improve your car, then it goes round corners better and then you are faster. \"Everybody thinks that Michael wins because there is some Schumacher magic. The guy is bloody good, but he has a good team and a terrific team behind him. He's not doing anything different to anybody else. He's just driving the car and the car is quicker. Simple. \"Sure, Michael is beatable. Everybody is. Michael has the best car and they [Ferrari] are doing the best job. And the driver who has the best package is going to win. That's formula one and it has always been that way.\" The Jaguar team, meanwhile, breathed a brief sigh of relief as their Michelin tyres gave the hitherto troublesome R3s something of a performance boost, enabling Eddie Irvine and Pedro de la Rosa to be sixth and eighth fastest. For the second race in a row Tom Walkinshaw's Cosworth-powered Arrows cars sat out the first session because of legal wrangling over the team's future. \"As we speak there are still negotiations going on in London with investors in the team,\" said Walkinshaw, who would not name the parties. \"We were advised to do very little today so that consequences of anything happening on the track wouldn't interfere with the negotiations.\" The reality is that Walkinshaw is attempting to persuade the Morgan Grenfell bank, which has a stake in the team, that preventing Arrows from recruiting new investors to help with an outstanding loan will only bankrupt the team. \"The cars will be running tomorrow but we are taking things one day at a time at the moment,\" he said.
