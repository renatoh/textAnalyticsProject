The study, by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, found there had been no improvement in the number of children living in poverty in Scotland in recent years, despite commitments to halve child poverty levels by 2010 and eradicate it entirely by 2020. The report calls on the Scottish government to do more to tackle the issue, including improving employment opportunities for parents, and increasing access to affordable, quality childcare. Ten years ago, Scotland led the way in tackling child poverty with the numbers reducing at a faster rate than elsewhere in the UK. But the JRF's findings show that in the last five years, the numbers of children living in poverty north of the border have remained static, and levels are now similar to the rest of the UK. It is estimated that some 210,000 Scottish children, or 21%, are classed as living in poverty. The figure for the UK as a whole is 24%, although that is skewed by high rates of child poverty in London and the Midlands. Dr Stephen Sinclair, deputy director of the Scottish Poverty Information Unit at Glasgow Caledonian University, one of the report's authors, said childcare was a contributing factor. \"In Scotland, we have a key thing we don't do as well as the rest of the UK and that's childcare,\" he said. \"Affordable, quality childcare is a problem for parents, particularly lone parents. That needs further action and the Scottish government recognises this.\" Experts also blame insufficient benefits for the lack of progress on child poverty. \"The figures (for Scotland) have flatlined over the last few years,\" said John Dickie, of the Scottish Child Poverty Action Group. \"In the first part of the last decade we saw real progress in the numbers \u2013 they were coming down faster in Scotland than anywhere elsewhere in the UK . What has happened is that, much in the same way as the rest of the UK, progress has ground to a halt over the last few years, essentially because the level of investment in child benefits and tax credits has not been sustained, and we are beginning to see the limits of the existing welfare-to-work policies. \"It's not good enough just to get parents into work. That work needs to pay enough and be flexible enough so that it provides a real route out of poverty.\" Sinclair called on the Scottish government to encourage employers to create more flexible jobs that allow parents to combine work and care responsibilities, and provide in-work support and advice to help parents remain in employment. They should also be giving serious consideration to the concept of a Scottish living wage and what more public sector employers can do to tackle poverty among their employees. \"The political opportunities to end child poverty in Scotland are potentially greater than in many other parts of the UK,\" said Dr Sinclair. \"This places a huge responsibility on the Scottish government to do all it can to achieve the target of eradicating child poverty by 2020.\" Holyrood was to be commended, however, on their sensitive handling of the issue. \"One thing the Scottish government does deserve credit for is the tone, the language they use,\" he said. \"There is no condemnation and none of the blame-the-victim language that we have seen from certain UK government ministers who have talked about a lack of aspiration.\" A spokesman for the Scottish government said it was doing everything within its devolved powers to deal with the issue, which remained a \"scourge on our nation\". \"Scotland will be best placed to eradicate child poverty when full responsibility for all tax, spending and social welfare issues come within the control of the Scottish parliament and government,\" he said. The government is committed to an anti-poverty framework with the target of increasing the proportion of income earned by the bottom 30% of Scotland's population by 2017, he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
