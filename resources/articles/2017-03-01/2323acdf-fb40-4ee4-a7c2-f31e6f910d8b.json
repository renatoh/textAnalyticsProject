The former NFL quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner was informed of the assignment on Monday. \u201cSending him to a full-season club is what we hoped to be able to do,\u201d Mets general manager Sandy Alderson told Newsday. \u201cAnd based on what he\u2019s done in spring training, and his whole body of work since last fall, we feel comfortable with him going to Columbia.\u201d The 29-year-old is hitting .235 \u2013 four hits in 17 at-bats \u2013 in seven games for the Mets in spring training entering Monday\u2019s Grapefruit League exhibition game against the Detroit Tigers, where he was expected to start in leftfield. Tebow, who saw regular-season action in three NFL seasons with the Denver Broncos and New York Jets in addition to brief practice-squad stints with the Eagles and Patriots, received a $100,000 bonus to sign with the Mets organization in September despite having not played organized baseball since his junior year of high school in 2005. The Fireflies open the season on 6 April with a seven-game homestand. \u201cTim Tebow will bring major excitement and national attention to the Fireflies and city of Columbia,\u201d Fireflies team president John Katz said in a statement on the club\u2019s website. \u201cBaseball fans, sports fans and Tim Tebow fans will likely come from around the southeast to see him play. We expect this to add to the energy at Spirit Communications Park and around downtown Columbia, especially during our opening weekend.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
