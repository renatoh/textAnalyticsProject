But like such other second-tier works as Sinclair Lewis's Babbitt or Budd Schulberg's What Makes Sammy Run?, Warren's sprawling melodrama - first published 60 years ago last summer and now made into a film for the second time - created an American archetype. Does that creature still live? Willie Stark, the self-described \"hick\" politician who makes himself virtual dictator of a deep-southern state before being gunned down in the lobby of a skyscraper he created, was based on Louisiana governor and senator Huey Long (1893-1935). The most roguish of 20th-century American demagogues, a \"progressive\" caudillo with a touch of Ubu Roi, Long was unique for his left-liberal views - on matters of race as well as economics. Louisiana was a chunk of the third world when Long was elected governor in 1928. It had one of the highest illiteracy rates in the country; it had fewer than 300 miles of paved roads and only three modern bridges. Long embarked on a huge public-works campaign financed by taxing the oil companies that dominated the state. Over the course of his reign, he built countless highways, 111 bridges and a 34-storey state office building - while putting together a coercive political machine that tithed state employees at 10% of their salaries. Long was loathed by Louisiana's elite but, although impeached as governor, he avoided conviction, and two years later won a Senate seat. During the early New Deal, he had a considerable impact on the national scene; his share-the-wealth populism pushed Franklin D Roosevelt left even as Long schemed to push him from office. Long planned an independent presidential run in 1936, hoping to split the New Deal coalition and elect a Republican against whom he could run in 1940. In Forerunners of American Fascism, Raymond Gram Swing called Long \"the hillbilly come into power, with the crudity of the hillbilly and his native shrewdness multiplied tenfold\". For FDR, the Louisiana senator was \"one of the two most dangerous men in the country\" (the other was General Douglas MacArthur). Few tears were shed in Washington when Long was assassinated by the son-in-law of a political enemy. A natural performer, Long was one of the first politicians to use sound trucks, and he was a master of the airwaves. (Acknowledging his populist origins by appropriating William Jennings Bryan's slogan \"Every man a king\", Long signalled his modernity by nicknaming himself the Kingfish, after a character in the hit radio show Amos'n'Andy.) Long was also a master of invective. Anyone harbouring the slightest class envy has to appreciate his extravagant attacks on the Rockefellers and Mellons. The New Yorker reporter AJ Liebling compared these scurrilous antics to those of Charlie Chaplin, albeit noting: \"It is hard to put yourself across as a buffoon and a potential martyr at the same time.\" For Liebling, Long was basically a rube - \"a chubby man [with] ginger hair and tight skin that was the colour of a sunburn\", an \"uneasy\" combination comparable to \"an orange tie on a pink shirt\". But other writers were fascinated by Long's genius. Before All the King's Men, Long had already inspired no fewer than five novels - Sinclair Lewis's It Can't Happen Here (1935); two books by Hamilton Basso, Long's chronicler and a friend of Faulkner, Cinnamon Seed (1934) and Sun in Capricorn (1935); John Dos Passos's Number One (1943); and Adria Locke Langley's bestseller A Lion is in the Street (1945). Robert Penn Warren, a professor at Louisiana State University when the school was the governor's private preserve, had been working since 1938 on his Huey Long story, initially as a verse drama. He finished the play in Mussolini's Italy - \"The thud of boot heels of parading Black Shirts on the cobble stones of Rome seemed to give appropriate sound effects\" - and, once back home, began turning it into a novel. All the King's Men, as one early reviewer noted, posed the question of the age: \"Can the man of ideas work with the dictator in the interests of historic change?\" It won the Pulitzer prize in May 1947. Harry Cohn, boss of Columbia, paid $200,000 for the rights and hired Robert Rossen to write, produce and direct an adaptation. The project turned more political when Rossen, one of the most successful communists in Hollywood, was subpoenaed by the House Un-American Activities Committee. To his chagrin, the filmmaker was not then called upon to testify. He thus eluded the blacklist (temporarily), and the production went forward. Originally, Cohn wanted to cast Spencer Tracy as Willie Stark. Then another name surfaced. An agent, Charlie Feldman, sent Rossen's screenplay to Hollywood's fastest-rising action hero, John Wayne. The star was scandalised - to the point, according to his biographers, of being moved to chuck ashtrays and heave furniture around. Wayne wrote Feldman a furious missive, informing him that he found the script despicable: All the King's Men \"smears the machinery of government for no purpose of humour or enlightenment\", \"degrades all relationships\" and defames \"the American way of life\". The part went to another, less glamorous specialist in western roles, Broderick Crawford. Meanwhile, Warren had adapted his novel for the stage. This new version was first presented by the leftwing German \u00e9migr\u00e9 Erwin Piscator at New York's New School for Social Research. Typical of Piscator's experimental Dramatic Workshop, the production placed its non-professional actors on a revolving stage and in the audience, and it involved various projections - one a film clip satirising the Nazi propaganda documentary Triumph of the Will. Rossen was also interested in evoking a totalitarian regime, but his film - shot on location in Stockton, California, under the influence of Italian neo-realism - involved a different strategy. Rossen's All the King's Men makes no specific references to Louisiana or even the south. But in its combination of rough populist politics, orchestrated hoopla and a hypnotised electorate, the movie comes closer than any other in imagining a fascist America. Crawford's Stark is a baffling character - a self-absorbed, narcissistic idealist, fuelled by resentment and ambition. Once he realises he has been framed for the election, he reinvents himself as an \"angry hick\" and enjoys a startling reversal of fortune, transformed into an American Mussolini: \"Willie Stark, Messiah or Dictator?\" as one newsreel has it. (Industry insiders believed that Crawford's performance was actually based on Harry Cohn. A year later, Crawford played another character modelled on Cohn: the uncouth millionaire junk dealer in Born Yesterday.) Power quickly corrupts and, to make it obvious, the initially teetotalling Willie is always half crocked. This monster autocrat looks back to Citizen Kane and forward to Lonesome Rhodes, the cracker-barrel demagogue of Elia Kazan and Budd Schulberg's 1957 A Face in the Crowd. Wayne's distaste notwithstanding, All the King's Men would have been a far scarier movie had he accepted the lead role. (Fittingly, he was beaten for the Oscar that year by the man who did.) Political hostility scarcely ended with the Duke. According to Edward Dmytryk, one of the original Hollywood Ten, Rossen was called to account by the Communist party's Hollywood commissar, John Howard Lawson: \"Censure is too flabby a word. Rossen's excoriation took place during a meeting of the Ten\" where the \"bewildered\" director spent the evening \"pilloried by Lawson and those two acid-tongued specialists in the party's disciplinary procedures, [Herbert] Biberman and [Alvah] Bessie\". Although Dmytryk professes not to understand the party's problem, the movie - like the novel - clearly uses the character of Stark's upper-class hatchet man Jack Burden to ponder the relationship of intellectuals to political power. \"You can't make an omelette without cracking eggs,\" Burden explains by way of justifying Stark's strong-arm tactics. That Rossen had appropriated a notorious remark by the Stalin apologist Walter Duranty could scarcely have passed unnoticed. Despite the sectarian disputes, All the King's Men and its star were named best picture and best actor by the New York Film Critics Circle. Still, Rossen had to plead with Cohn to get the movie a qualifying run in Los Angeles and personally paid for ads in the trade papers. Nominated for six Oscars, All the King's Men was named best picture - with Crawford and Mercedes McCambridge (in her screen debut as Stark's mistress and handler Sadie Burke) winning for actor and supporting actress. It grossed $2.4m, Columbia's top money-maker for 1950. Eight years later, Sidney Lumet directed a live television version of All the King's Men, adapted by Don Mankiewicz and with Stark played by the B-movie heavy Neville Brand. Rossen's anti-hero evoked European dictators; the devolved Willie conceptualised by Lumet and Mankiewicz is a bullying blackmailer with a brutish persona suggestive of Al Capone (whom Brand would soon play) or the recently deposed demagogue Senator Joseph McCarthy. There's nothing remotely idealistic about this Stark. A year later Warren reclaimed his turf, offering yet another version of his play. The adaptation one really wants to see, however, is the 1971 Soviet mini-series, directed by Mikhail Kozakov. Had All the King's Men been remade or staged in the 60s or 70s, the key referent would surely have been Alabama governor George Wallace, a southern governor running for president who, like Huey Long, was taken out (by a would-be assassin) before the election. As it was, the property lay dormant until the age of Reagan, when it re-emerged in musical form as an anachronistic historical spectacle. Carlisle Floyd's opera (Willie Stark) was succeeded by Adrian Hall's mixed-media pageant, with a score by New Orleans-born Randy Newman (mainly drawn from his 1974 LP, Good Ol' Boys. Perhaps the property's latest impresario director-writer Steve Zaillian should have gone the theatrical route in adapting All the King's Men. Rather than a revivalist political passion play, Zaillian has produced a heavily atmospheric southern gothic. Distant thunder rumbles as a high-powered Anglo-American cast slogs through the marsh grass of Warren's narrative, to which Zaillian is most faithful. Compared with beef slabs like Crawford and Brand, Sean Penn's Willie is a calculating pipsqueak. Despite his coxcomb coiffure, there's nothing dramatic about his transformation into a sneering, swaggering, puffed-up autocrat, nor in the fascination with which he's regarded by his high-born betters, mostly played by British actors - Jude Law, Kate Winslet and Sir Anthony Hopkins. Shot on location in pre-Hurricane Katrina Louisiana, the latest All the King's Men wrapped in March 2005 and was scheduled for release that autumn. Then test screenings revealed audiences were confused by the hopscotch chronology. Extensively re-edited and delayed by a year, Zaillian's film is still cluttered with flashbacks and memories. Elements of the 30s, 40s, and 50s are mixed in the service of a brooding myth. Evidently, the movie was prompted by superstar political consultant (and native Louisianan) James Carville, who mentioned to Hollywood producer and Democratic fundraiser Mike Medavoy that the time was ripe for a new version. Why? The Huey Long story once served as a case study of radio-fuelled populism, a vision of brass-knuckled American fascism or, as in the case of Ken Burns's career-launching 1985 documentary, a bit of fascinating Americana, but its contemporary relevance seems limited. Zaillian evinces far more sympathy for his Willie than either Rossen or Lumet show for theirs, but it's an oddly unrequited affection. There's little that's lovable about Penn's Stark. The actor may have taken the actual Huey Long as the model for his speeches, most delivered to a nocturnal zombie audience, but it's a cold performance. No one will ever confuse this Willie with that other former governor, flawed liberal, sexual hound dog and impeachment survivor who so recently dominated America's political imagination. Perhaps that's the point. Could this All the King's Men have been pre-emptive? Was Carville putting yet another spin on the blighted career of his erstwhile boss? Was he obliterating the memory of the late 90s All the King's Men knock-off, Primary Colours. The outsized figure of the Louisiana dictator has long since been eclipsed by that of our generation's most successful southern politician. Bill Clinton once gave a university lecture on Willie Stark's tragic corruption. His own career, at once greater and more diminished, would be a tragicomedy to conjure with. \u00b7 All the King's Men is released on Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
