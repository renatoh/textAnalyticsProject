Coleman had said before Saturday\u2019s draw that he wanted to avoid the distraction of facing England but having been pitted against them in Lens in Group B, he is now looking forward to the all-British clash with anticipation. \u201cKnowing Baley, knowing his mentality, he will take it in his stride. He always wants to perform for Wales, he knows how important he is and the way we play and this is our first tournament for a long, long time,\u201d said Coleman of the first Welsh side to qualify for a major finals since 1958. \u201cHe knows he has the capacity to turn a game on its head. If he is on fire, he will score a goal no matter who he is playing against. There is a lot of pressure on him as well. Because of his mentality he will take all of this in his stride.\u201d Coleman said that Bale\u2019s experience in Madrid since becoming the world\u2019s most expensive player would stand him in good stead next summer. \u201cHe has been in Madrid and it is a goldfish bowl. He is used to having that sort of pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time he comes back from Madrid with Wales you could see him growing, maturing. He is a lot different now than he was three years ago, I can assure you of that.\u201d Coleman conceded there would now be huge pressure on Wales to get a result in their first match against Slovakia if they want to qualify. England play Russia in their opener on the same day, 11 June. \u201cThe pressure will be on us to get something in that first game because we know what is coming next. We have three games we have to perform in \u2013 it is not a case of saving something for the next one.\u201d The Wales coach, whose side qualified by finishing second behind Belgium, said the draw would put as much pressure on England as his side. \u201cEveryone was asking me for my reasons for not wanting England, but it was not because of the fear we wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t get a result, it was what came with it,\u201d he said. \u201cLuckily it is not the first game. I am excited and it will be great. The game will be fantastic.\u201d Coleman and Hodgson have known one another since they briefly crossed paths at Blackburn, when the former was a player and the latter a coach. \u201cI have a lot of respect for Roy. I worked with him when I was a player \u2013 an excellent coach,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been in this industry, on this side, for 15 years and for him to do what he has done and the length of time, you have to be pretty special. He is a good guy as well.\u201d Coleman was sold by Blackburn before Hodgson got the chance to see him play but the England manager said they had become friends since. \u201cI don\u2019t even remember if he actually did any training sessions with us, he was sold on even before I got a chance to see him. He doesn\u2019t hold that against me,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we share a love, of course, and an appreciation of Fulham Football Club which was good to both of us in Chris as a player and manager and me as a manager.\u201d The Republic of Ireland coach, Martin O\u2019Neill, meanwhile, said he was \u201cmorose\u201d after landing Italy, Sweden and Belgium in the draw and believes his side will have to explode out of the blocks in their opening match against Sweden to stand a chance of going through."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
