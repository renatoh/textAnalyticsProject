Decide on a message, goes the mantra, and never deviate. So it was that the \"new\" Masters was presented to the world this week \u2013 a kinder, gentler place where the players would be given the freedom to express their talents and the fans would be able to reacquaint themselves with what was once the most dependably exciting tournament in golf (as long as they didn't run anywhere on the premises, of course). \"Let's have some fun,\" Payne announced on the first tee on Thursday after Arnold Palmer, in his role of honorary starter, had whacked the first shot of the week. And by and large, everybody has \u2013 even Rory McIlroy, who learned that Augusta's munificence extends all the way into the offices of the competition rules committee. At any other tournament in the world, the chances are that the Irish teenager would have been disqualified for his minor transgression, but, as in so many facets of its behaviour, Augusta runs to the beat of a different drum when it comes to interpreting the rules of golf. It has tended towards leniency through the years, as Ernie Els and Palmer have discovered. Some would argue this is yet another manifestation of Augusta's arrogance, but it is also a charter for common sense. This was one such occasion and if the rules absolutists were harrumphing over their clubhouse lunch today at the get out of jail card given to McIlroy, then they can at least take some mean-spirited comfort in the fact that the youngster will never be allowed to forget Friday's events. Meanwhile, the rest of humanity will take the time to consider the supreme irony involved in heaping so much opprobrium on a teenager guilty of nothing more than impetuosity when a far greater \"crime\" against the golf goes relatively unnoticed. Obviously, no one knows how the final round will turn out, but we can already predict one of the central tenets of the post-victory reviews. The roars at Augusta were missing and now they are back \u2013 as anyone who spent yesterday afternoon at Amen Corner will testify. It was yet another memorable experience in what had been a wonderful week. For that, Payne deserves credit, even if he wasn't actually responsible for the glorious weather. Unlike his predecessor, the ghastly Hootie Johnson, Augusta's current chairman is not constitutionally averse to the modern world, as those who have visited the tournament website will know. It is a magnificent resource,; easily the best of its kind anywhere in the sporting world. Yet it is only a website and, brilliant though it is, it is not the reason why the Masters has been held in such esteem for so long. That credit belongs to Alastair Mackenzie, the Scotland-born genius responsible for Augusta's unique layout. Golf course architecture is one of those subjects guaranteed to send the casual fan to sleep, and who can blame anyone for that. After all, you don't need to know how John and Paul wrote \"I Saw Her Standing There\" , only that it is a brilliantly crafted song and sounds great. The problem arises, or at least public interest begins to wane, when the music sounds off-key, and for the last few years the Masters has sounded like Gerry and the Pacemakers \u2013 a pale facsimile of the real thing. Those who do take an interest in architecture and who have long considered Augusta to be the most strategically brilliant layout in the world (outside of St Andrews, at least) know that the responsibility for \"crime\" lies largely with Johnson, who sanctioned a series of changes to the course around the start of the decade that undermined its elemental genius. Holes were lengthened, trees planted, rough grown. Thinking golf was replaced by mindless golf. Where once players had multiple options, they now had one: middle of fairway, middle of green, hope for a single putt and for God's sake don't take any risks. Therein lay the road to public indifference, and the Masters was halfway there. Fortunately, Payne appears to have recognised the problem and he is nimble enough to do something about it. \"The changes to the course this year were relatively minor,\" he said before the tournament started, which was strictly accurate in fact, but somewhat disingenuous in tone. The changes were indeed minor \u2013 a 10-yard overall reduction in the course yardage, a few trees taken out here and there \u2013 but the intent was clear. Payne can't criticise Johnson directly, but he has done so indirectly, by softening the greens and pushing up tee boxes. Nor can he undo Johnson's botch job, at least not in one go \u2013 that would be the ultimate affront to the code of the Green Jackets. In the meantime, the man in charge has sought to make his point in more subtle ways, by bringing the birdies and generating a measurement of excitement. For that he deserves the plaudits that are likely to come his way after the last putt has dropped."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
