But when the 52 workers arrived on Tuesday at Punchestown racecourse, site of the Oxegen festival, they were met with a surprise. Instead of the hotel they had been promised by contract cleaners Cleanevent, they were told they would be sleeping on the concrete floor of the stables. The block had breeze-block walls, no windows or flooring, and, some of the workers claimed, only enough campbeds for a third of them. A spokesman for the contractors, which also supplies Wimbledon and Wembley Stadium, said it was investigating the claims. Only after one worker called the police did the organisers promise to buy inflatable mattresses, placed in a kitchen metres away from the dressing rooms of artists such as REM, the Verve and Amy Winehouse, all of whom play tonight. Sonia Mendes, one of the workers, said: \"For me, no way. It would have been shameful for me to stay.\" She and two others insisted on being bussed back to London the following day. David Hanley, a spokesman for Cleanevent, said it was looking into the reports. The event's promoter, MCD, said it \"worked with contractors in advance to ensure all staff requirements are fully met.\" Each contractor was responsible for its own staff welfare, it said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
