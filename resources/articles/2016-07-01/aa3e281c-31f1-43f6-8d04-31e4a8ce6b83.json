Of the total amount raised by Clinton, roughly $40.5 million was made on behalf of her own campaign, with an additional $28 million raised for the Democratic National Committee and state parties. Donald Trump used funds from his nonprofit Donald J Trump foundation to buy a signed Tim Tebow football helmet for $12,000 at a charity auction, in a transaction that possibly violated IRS rules against self-dealing, the Washington Post reported. Using nonprofit funds for personal use is generally illegal, although the legality of the football helmet transaction is unclear, according to three tax law experts interviewed by the Post. Loretta Lynch, the US attorney general, acknowledged on Friday that her meeting with Bill Clinton this week had \u201ccast a shadow\u201d over the justice department\u2019s investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Lynch said she would \u201cfully accept\u201d whatever recommendations were made by the FBI and prosecutors, but sought to quell concerns stemming from the encounter with Bill Clinton, at an airport in Phoenix, reiterating that the justice department process for the email case remained wholly independent. Kevin Kellems, a seasoned political operative brought aboard the Trump campaign on 20 June to oversee surrogates and coordinate their messaging, abruptly resigned from the position after less than two weeks. Kellems was director of communications for former vice president Dick Cheney and worked on Newt Gingrich\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign. In his resignation letter, quoted by the New York Times, Kellems said he has \u201cenjoyed meeting some fine and dedicated people.\u201d According to the conservative Daily Caller, former secretary of state and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will meet tomorrow with representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Up for discussion: the investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. Citing \u201ca source close to the investigation,\u201d the Daily Caller reports that the interview may be conducted at Clinton\u2019s home in Washington, DC. The interview is likely \u201cthe final step\u201d in the FBI\u2019s investigation. The Democratic party has released a draft of its national party platform online this afternoon. The first draft, which will be finalized at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia later this month, features a long wishlist of progressive policies, including a $15 national minimum wage, equal pay for women, a \u201cmultimillionaire surtax,\u201d acknowledgment that the Trans-Pacific Partnership is controversial within the party and numerous other policy planks. Earlier today, Donald Trump asked a Turkish man whether he was \u201cfriend or foe\u201d during a speech at the Western Conservative Summit in Denver, Colorado. The comments, which appeared to be in jest, were directed at a man later identified as Yusuf Serce, a journalist and columnist. One day after the first quarterly deadline since Hillary Clinton became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, the former secretary of state\u2019s campaign has released its first fundraising numbers: $68.5 million for the month of June. \u201cMore than 1.5 million grassroots donors have stepped up to say you\u2019re committed to stopping Donald Trump - and to breaking the highest glass ceiling in America,\u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign stated in a release. Of the total amount raised by Clinton, roughly $40.5 million was made on behalf of her own campaign, with an additional $28 million raised for the Democratic National Committee and state parties. The Democratic party has released a draft of its national party platform online this afternoon. The first draft, which will be finalized at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia later this month, features a long wishlist of progressive policies, including a $15 national minimum wage, equal pay for women, a \u201cmultimillionaire surtax,\u201d acknowledgment that the Trans-Pacific Partnership is controversial within the party and numerous other policy planks. Some of the key proposals: \u201cWe believe that Americans should earn at least $15 an hour and have the right to form or join a union. We applaud the approaches taken by states like New York and California. We should raise and index the minimum wage, give all Americans the ability to join a union regardless of where they work, and create new ways for workers to have power in the economy. We also support creating one fair wage for all workers by ending the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers and people with disabilities.\u201d \u201cWe will fight to secure equal pay for women and - after 240 years - finally enshrine the rights of women in the constitution by passing the Equal Rights Amendment. While Donald Trump thinks it is \u2018dangerous\u2019 for women to leave the home and paid family leave hurts our economy, Democrats will make sure that the United States finally enacts national paid family and medical leave by passing a family and medical leave act that would provide at least 12 weeks of paid leave to care for a new child or address a personal or family member\u2019s serious health issue, and we will fight to allow workers the right to earn at least seven days of paid sick leave.\u201d \u201cDemocrats will not hesitate to use and expand existing authorities as well as empower regulators to downsize or break apart financial institutions when necessary to protect the public and safeguard financial stability, including new authorities to go after risky shadow-banking activities. Banks should not be able to gamble with taxpayers\u2019 deposits or pose an undue risk to Main Street.\u201d \u201cWe will ask those at the top to contribute to our country\u2019s future by establishing a multimillionaire surtax to ensure millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share.\u201d \u201cWe will only approve new trade agreements if they support American jobs, raise wages, and improve our national security ... We should never enter into a trade agreement that prevents our government, or other governments, from putting in place rules that protect the environment, food safety, or the health of American citizens or others around the world.\u201d \u201cWe will continue to stand up to Republican efforts to defund Planned Parenthood health centers, which provide critical health services to millions of people. We will continue to oppose - and seek to overturn - federal and state laws and policies that impede a woman\u2019s access to abortion, including by repealing the Hyde Amendment.\u201d \u201cOn the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), there are a diversity of views in the party. Many Democrats are on record stating that the agreement does not meet the standards set out in this platform; other Democrats have expressed support for the agreement. But all Democrats believe that any trade agreement must protect workers and the environment and not undermine access to critically-needed prescription drugs.\u201d \u201cWe will reform mandatory minimum sentences and close private prisons and detention centers ... We will invest in training for officers on issues such as de-escalation and the appropriate use of force, and encourage better police-community relations and the use of smart strategies like police body cameras. We will end racial profiling that targets individuals, based solely on race, religion, ethnicity, and national origin, which is un-American and counterproductive.\u201d \u201cWe reject attempts to impose a religious test to bar immigrants or refugees from entering the United States. It is un-American and runs counter to the founding principles of this country.\u201d \u201cDemocrats support a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Citizens United and Buckley v. Valeo. We need to end secret, unaccountable money in politics by requiring, through executive order or legislation, significantly more disclosure and transparency - by outside groups, federal contractors, and public corporations to their shareholders.\u201d \u201cFinally, Democrats will not stand for the divisive and derogatory language of Donald Trump. His offensive comments about immigrants and other communities have no place in our society. This kind of rhetoric must be rejected.\u201d Earlier this year, the Guardian sought out Bernie Sanders supporters who said they would rather vote for Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton. Surveys at the time suggested a small proportion of Sanders fans, 7%, were willing to make such a switch. We decided to go back to 150 of the 500 or so supporters who contacted us to see if Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union had made them more or less likely to favor the Republican Trump over the Democrat Clinton. Our thinking was that the economic and political turmoil caused by the success of a campaign based on nationalistic, anti-immigration sentiment led by a charismatic rightwing leader might have prompted some second thoughts. Sanders penned an op-ed for the New York Times this week urging the Democrats to bring struggling working-class disaffected voters into the party fold rather than pushing them towards Trump. So what was this group of Sanders supporters thinking, post-Brexit? About 50 responses were received. Some said they were no longer considering switching to Trump. About half backed Brexit, half opposed it. Most of those who were still switching to Trump said they saw the Brexit result as vindication of their decision to back the Republican. Except in one case, those who opposed Brexit did not feel inspired to change their voting behavior in the wake of the UK\u2019s decision. \u201c[The] outcome only concretes my vote for Trump, because I think in the long run it will do us good rather than harm, just like this Brexit vote,\u201d wrote Peter Kartachian, a 34-year-old machinist from California. \u201cThese Chicken Littles who are claiming the world is ending because of this will soon be shown to be the empty suits that they are.\u201d In at least two cases, Brexit has flipped previously unsure voters into the Trump column. One New York woman, Janet H, who asked for her surname not to be used as she didn\u2019t want her family to know she is backing Trump, said she\u2019d been leaning towards the Republican candidate until his racist comments about a judge of Mexican origin led her to switch, begrudgingly, to Clinton. \u201cThen Brexit happened,\u201d said Janet H. Yet another Republican \u00e9minence grise has come out strongly against Donald Trump\u2019s impending presidential nomination - this time, a former chair of the Republican National Committee itself. Marc Racicot, a former governor of Montana and chair of the RNC, has published an editorial in the Washington Post calling on \u201ca second miracle in Cleveland\u201d to prevent Trump\u2019s accession to the party\u2019s nomination, writing that the real estate mogul has \u201cneither the aforementioned qualities of principled leadership, nor offered any substantive or serious conservative policy proposals\u201d to merit the position. \u201cAfter long and careful consideration, I cannot endorse or support [the voters\u2019] decision to express their frustration, anger and disappointment by selecting Trump as the Republican nominee for president,\u201d Racicot wrote. Trump, he said, has failed to demonstrate, among other things, \u201cpersistent seriousness, solemn and honest commitment to the interests of others, exhaustive study and detailed proposals, sincerity, humility, empathy, dignity, fairness, patience, genuine respect for all of God\u2019s children, durability, modesty and the absence of self-interest.\u201d In addition, Racicot continued, Trump\u2019s inconsistency with the Republican platform on a myriad of issues make him unsuitable for the nomination. \u201cBoth, in my humble view, are indispensable preconditions to his selection as the Republican candidate for the office of president of the United States,\u201d Racicot wrote. \u201cAs a result, I cannot endorse or support Trump for president.\u201d Eternal presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is using his vast email listserv to warn his supporters about labels on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in US food, kicking off with an email titled simply \u201cMonsanto.\u201d \u201cThe corporate interests are at it again,\u201d Sanders wrote. \u201cMonsanto, agribusiness and the bio-tech industry have spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to overturn legislation passed by Vermont, Connecticut, Maine and Alaska that calls for the labeling of GMO food. In fact, they are moving aggressively now because Vermont\u2019s strong law goes into effect today.\u201d \u201cThis legislation is important because people have a right to know what is in the food they and their children eat. The more information we have, the better consumers we become. This is not a radical idea. It is why over 60 countries around the world have passed GMO labeling laws.\u201d Most scientific reports have indicated that GMOs are generally safe, both to humans and the environment, although Sanders has dismissed studies showing this as either too short-sighted or financially backed by agribusiness interests. House minority leader Nancy Pelosi released a statement this afternoon condemning the decision by House Republicans to hold a vote on an amendment, rejected by the Senate, that fails to close what her office characterized as \u201cthe terrorist gun loophole\u201d: \u201cAll across America, families are demanding real action to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and suspected terrorists, not a toothless NRA bill that will do nothing to keep our communities safe,\u201d Pelosi stated. \u201cThe American people cannot understand why Republicans want it to be easier for a suspected terrorist to buy a lethal weapon than to set foot on a plane. If you\u2019re too dangerous to fly in America, you\u2019re too dangerous to buy a gun in America \u2013 simple as that. But a month after the worst mass shooting in American history, House Republicans are once again putting the NRA ahead of their responsibility to keep the American people safe.\u201d Pelosi called the motion, submitted by Texas senator John Cornyn, \u201cjust the latest evidence that House Republicans have become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the NRA.\u201d At the risk of overusing the term \u201cshade...\u201d According to the conservative Daily Caller, former secretary of state and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will meet tomorrow with representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Up for discussion: the investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. Citing \u201ca source close to the investigation,\u201d the Daily Caller reports that the interview may be conducted at Clinton\u2019s home in Washington, DC. The interview is likely \u201cthe final step\u201d in the FBI\u2019s investigation. Federal officials have already interviewed top Clinton aides, including Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin. It\u2019s not known when the investigation will conclude. James Comey, the FBI\u2019s director, has repeatedly said that there is no specific timeline for wrapping it up. Maria La Ganga is inside the Western conservative summit for the Guardian \u2013 and reports that the amazing crowd Trump has been boasting about from the stage is actually quite sparse: Trump is claiming credit for Nato developing an anti-terrorism unit. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m an expert on Nato. Nobody ever asked me about Nato before. But I have a lot of common sense, and a lot of business sense.\u201d Trump has called Nato obsolete. He says he did not mean abandon it. He said he might have meant fix it. \u201cIt\u2019s a different world. I see things that a lot of people don\u2019t.\u201d Trump is on to the Bill Clinton - Loretta Lynch meeting. He questions whether the meeting was a coincidence and casts doubt on Lynch\u2019s description of the conversation, which she said was about CLinton\u2019s grandkids and golf. Trump also drops a little news: all of his children and his wife will be speaking at the Republican convention. \u201cYou see what happened where Bill Clinton goes into an airplane. He just happened to be at the airport,\u201d Trump says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a joke. It\u2019s a serious thing... As you know, Hillary is so guilty... how that\u2019s not being pursued properly. I think he really opened it up. He opened up a Pandora\u2019s Box and it shows what\u2019s going on with our laws, with our government.\u201d Trump doubts Clinton\u2019s presence at the airport was coincidental. And he wants to know how Lynch and Clinton spent their time together \u2013 it\u2019s unknown how long they met for but it\u2019s been described as a half-hour \u2013 what did they talk about? Trump says he loves his grandchildren, \u201cbut if I talk about them for more than about nine or ten seconds ... after that, what are you gonna say, right? I love em. I love my children. My children are going to speaking at the convention... Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, Don... my wife is gonna be speaking at the convention. \u201cI love golf. But after talking about it for a couple of minutes, it\u2019s hard to talk about it.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to have job loss like you\u2019ve never seen, ever before, if I don\u2019t win.\u201d \u2013 Donald Trump Then Trump says he will expand the electoral map, by winning Ohio and Pennsylvania, but also, \u201cwe may even have a shot at New York and California\u201d because \u201cwe have tremendous crowds\u201d in those places. \u201cI think that we have a lot more leeway than anyone else running from the Republican party,\u201d Trump says. Everything he just said flies in the face of everything the polls are indicating. A Siena College poll in New York published Thursday depicted Clinton up 23 points on Trump in the state. But the polls could all be wrong. This is true. Trump is talking about repealing and replacing Obamacare. \u201cI already talked about the fact that we\u2019re going to save the second amendment, right? That\u2019s a biggie.\u201d Trump says he\u2019ll eliminate regulations, lower taxes and simplify the tax code. \u201cHillary Clinton is raising your taxes \u2013 we\u2019re lowering your taxes big league,\u201d he says. Or was that \u201cbigly\u201d? We definitely heard \u201cbig league\u201d that time, after most always hearing \u201cbigly\u201d. Trump begins: \u201cOh if I\u2019d have known they had these TelePrompters I would\u2019ve used them.\u201d He jokes that he\u2019s getting used to the TelePrompters and he likes them. \u201cThis is a tremendous crowd and we really appreciate it,\u201d he says. Trump begins by talking about the delegates selection process in Colorado, where delegates were elected at a state convention dominated by Ted Cruz. \u201cAll of a sudden I didn\u2019t get the delegates,\u201d he says. \u201cThe system\u2019s rigged. It\u2019s rigged. It\u2019s rigged against the people.\u201d Trump quotes Fox host Bill O\u2019Reilly as saying that his political movement is the \u201csingle greatest phenomena\u201d that O\u2019Reilly has seen in his lifetime. Trump is now taking the stage. Here\u2019s that live stream again: After his speech, Trump will attend a private fundraiser hosted by beer magnate Pete Coors and former NFL coach Mike Shanahan. Here\u2019s a snippet of the Palin speech. She said something about the \u2018splodey heads keep sploding\u2019: It\u2019s a lively scene outside the Colorado convention center, where Trump is scheduled to speak imminently: At Trump\u2019s Manchester, New Hampshire, event Thursday afternoon, an attendee asked him about hiring military veterans to work for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), saying \u201cwhy aren\u2019t we putting our military retirees ... in TSA? Get rid of all these heebeejabis they wear at TSA, I\u2019ve seen them myself. We need the veterans back in there. \u201cYou know, and wee are looking at that,\u201d Trump says. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a lot of things\u201d. Trump is late to the conservative summit in Denver. But they say that it\u2019s been confirmed that he has landed. Donald Trump will meet at the weekend with Indiana governor Mike Pence, whose name has been floated as a potential Trump running mate. Pence is also up for reelection however, and the state party would have to submit a name to replace him \u2013 should he develop other plans \u2013 by 15 July. The Trump campaign acknowledged the planned meeting in a statement from communications advisor Jason Miller: Mr. Trump is meeting with a number of Republican leaders in the run-up to the convention in Cleveland, and he has a good relationship with Gov. Pence.\u201d Update: This post has been corrected. An earlier version stated that the Trump-Pence meeting had already taken place. Kevin Kellems, a seasoned political operative brought aboard the Trump campaign on 20 June to oversee surrogates and coordinate their messaging, has abruptly resigned after less than two weeks. Kellems was director of communications for former vice president Dick Cheney and worked on New Gingrich\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign. In his resignation letter, quoted by the New York Times, Kellems says he has \u201cenjoyed meeting some fine and dedicated people.\u201d While brief, it has been an interesting experience, and am proud of the contributions made through our early-phase project endeavors. Also have enjoyed meeting some fine and dedicated individuals throughout the organization. Look forward to running across several of you going forward. On Thursday, the Trump campaign parted ways with digital consultant Vincent Harris, a former employee of Rand Paul\u2019s presidential campaign, on the same week they hired him, the Times separately reported. Palin\u2019s stream-of-consciousness riff, her spontaneous spoken, prose poem is true to form: Together, we call em out. We call out the liars, cuz we\u2019re gonna make America great again. And this movement is exactly that... Trump is with us in withholding the oath, swearing to uphold what it is .. declarations of liberty... existential threats that others would ignore. The biggest most sinister threat, it\u2019s Islamic ideology, that is Isis, that is the death cult that isn\u2019t even acknowledged with actual verbage with leftists, with their heads in the sand... Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor, is addressing the Western conservative summit in Denver, Colorado, where Trump is due to speak shortly. There\u2019s a live stream on local NBC News. She\u2019s currently talking about the assault on the second amendment. And transitions to praise for Trump: \u201cAsk yourself, what have his critics ever built?\u201d Update: here\u2019s a live video stream: Here\u2019s a light moment from Lynch\u2019s appearance. What did her predecessor, Eric Holder, omit to mention about the job? How to lock the plane, she replies: Here\u2019s a good follow-up question for Lynch: will the recommendations from the emails inquiry be filtered through other political appointees, before she approves them as anticipated? \u201cIt\u2019s painful to me because the work of the department of justice is important,\u201d Lynch says of l\u2019affaire Bill Clinton. \u201cTo the extent that this issue has overshadowed that mission, yes, that\u2019s painful to me.\u201d She says she wants to provide as much information as possible so people have faith in the department of justice. When will the investigation wrap? she\u2019s asked. Lynch answers the question with some insight into the large scope of the investigation into Clinton\u2019s emails: I actually don\u2019t know that. I don\u2019t have that insight into the nuts and bolts... they\u2019re working on it to make sure they\u2019re as thorough as they can be, to look at it from every angle, to cover every issue.\u201d Now they switch to community policing. Lynch recounts the Clinton meeting: \u201cHe said hello, and we basically said hello. And I congratulated him on his conversation... and that led to a conversation about his travels... and then we spoke about former AG Janet Reno. \u201cBut it really was a social meeting. It really was in that regard... \u201cI do think that no matter how I viewed it, I understand how people view it. \u201cIt\u2019s cast a shadow over how this case is resolved,\u201d Lynch says, although in fact the meeting \u201cdoes not have a bearing on how this matter is reviewed...and resolved by me.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s important to me is, how do people view the department of justice because of that meeting?.. I felt that it\u2019s important to talk about what impact that meeting will have on the case, which it won\u2019t,\u201d she says. Does she regret not kicking Clinton off the plane? \u201cThe issue is how does it impact the work that I do... I certainly wouldn\u2019t do it again. \u201cIt has cast a shadow over what it should not. Over what it will not touch.\u201d Jonathan Capehart of the Washington Post is interviewing Lynch. Lynch tells him she expects to accept the recommendation of the team investigating the Clinton emails matter. She goes on to say the recommendation will be contained in a \u201cfinal report\u201d produced by the team, seeming to foreclose on the possibility of her altering or opposing the recommendation. \u201cI will be accepting their recommendations, and their plan for going forward,\u201d she says. She says the decision had been made before Bill Clinton boarded her plane on Monday. The Clinton meeting \u201chas raised concerns, I feel. While I can certainly say... I think people need the information in how that resolution will come about,\u201d she says. The first question: what happened in Phoenix? What on Earth were you thinking? Lynch says it\u2019s \u201ca perfectly reasonable question\u201d. \u201cPeople have wondered... about my role in the ultimate resolution in matters involving the investigation... certainly my meeting with him raises questions and concerns...\u201d She says it\u2019s a valid question. \u201cLet me be clear... as I\u2019ve always indicated the matter\u2019s being handled by career... investigators... it predates my tenure as AG... it is the same team. That team will make findings... they will make recommendations... [to be] reviewed by the FBI\u201d and the FBI director. \u201cThey present it to me and I fully expect to accept the recommendations,\u201d she says. It\u2019s not a recusal, she says, because she expects to be briefed on the findings, \u201cand I will be accepting their recommendations.\u201d But will she make her own determination? \u201cNo, the final determination as to how to proceed, will be contained within the final format of the report.\u201d \u201cThis case will be resolved by the team that\u2019s been working on it from the beginning... the FBI will review it... and that will be the finalization of factual findings and the next steps in this matter.\u201d Lynch is about to speak. The assigned topic of conversation is community policing. She\u2019s expected to address the Clinton emails controversy and may speak about her meeting with Bill Clinton on Monday. Here\u2019s the live stream: Donald Trump visited Capitol Hill in October 1993 to testify before the Native American affairs subcommittee about casino licenses for Native American tribes, who should get them \u2013 and how you can tell who\u2019s who. \u201cThey don\u2019t look like Indians to me,\u201d Trump says. Watch here: While we wait for the attorney general \u2013 for a catchup on the emails controversy, we refer you to Guardian Washington correspondent David Smith\u2019s piece from earlier this month, Could Hillary Clinton really be indicted over her emails? Here\u2019s the top: Did Hillary Clinton do the wrong thing when she used a private email server while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013? Yes. She herself has admitted that it was a mistake. A recent report by the state department inspector general found that she broke multiple rules despite repeated warnings to use official communications methods that would ensure her emails were stored and kept safe from hackers. Did she break the law? As an FBI investigation continues, expert opinion is divided. Some offer a view reminiscent of Bill Clinton\u2019s famous remark that he experimented with marijuana but \u201cdidn\u2019t inhale\u201d. \u201cI believe Clinton did break the law but at the same time I don\u2019t think there\u2019s evidence she committed a crime,\u201d says Douglas Cox, associate professor at City University of New York School of Law. It is a violation of federal records law to remove or destroy material, Cox notes, although Clinton \u201cin part\u201d fixed this by returning thousands of emails. More important in assessing whether a crime was committed is the question of intent, Cox says. \u201cWhile there were warnings and memos that she should have been aware of, from a prosecution side they would need to prove her knowledge and intent and have evidence of that to bring before a jury.\u201d Cox believes such evidence is lacking. In this sense the case is different from those of retired general David Petraeus, former director of the CIA, and Sandy Berger, ex-national security adviser, both of whom handled information they knew was classified and were wilfully deceitful. But a minority disagree with this analysis. Read the full piece here: A man appears at the Lynch event and says she has arrived but \u201cthe session will begin slightly delayed.\u201d Lynch is scheduled to appear any moment at the Aspen Ideas Festival. Here\u2019s a live video feed: Attorney general Loretta Lynch is expected to speak to reporters about the Clinton email affair, and possibly her impromptu (?) meeting Monday with Bill Clinton, in about 20 minutes. Offers to donate millions that turn out to be empty promises... it rings a bell somehow... More Trump Super Pac woes (further to Peter Stone\u2019s reporting we mentioned in the introductory post): rival Trump Super Pacs (outside groups that can raise and spend unlimited money but cannot legally coordinate with the campaign) are at war to attract the big-fish donors \u2013 but even Pacs with millions in commitments are having trouble actually collecting money people said they\u2019d give. Yahoo\u2019s Michael Isikoff reports on the Pac donation-collection problem: \u201cSo far, the pro-Trump super-PACs have banked only a small fraction of the tens of millions of dollars they had been promised by big contributors, sources familiar with the groups\u2019 fundraising operations tell Yahoo News\u201d: In early June, private equity mogul Thomas Barrack got big headlines when he told CNN that he had lined up $32 million in pledged contributions to Rebuilding America Now, a super-PAC he helped establish to promote Trump\u2019s candidacy. [...] But Rebulding America Now has collected only $2 million of those pledges \u2014 from a single donor \u2014 Laurance Gay, the managing director of Rebuilding America Now, confirmed to Yahoo News The LA Times reports on the tangle of Super Pacs fighting for supremacy in the rather meager world of pro-Trump fundraising: ...wealthy contributors wishing to invest in the pro-Trump effort are facing an odd assortment of super PACs with competing visions, questionable capacity and sometimes sketchy track records. According to election finance reports, of the dozen or so pro-Trump super PACs established so far, only a few have reported raising significant amounts of money or interest \u2014 for a total of about $4 million as of the end of May. And most of that has already been spent. Donald Trump used funds from his nonprofit Donald J Trump foundation to buy a signed Tim Tebow football helmet for $12,000 at a charity auction, in a transaction that possibly violated IRS rules against self-dealing, the Washington Post reports. Using nonprofit funds for personal use is generally illegal, although the legality of the football helmet transaction is unclear, according to three tax law experts interviewed by the Post. Trump got in a bidding war for the helmet at an auction to benefit the Susan G Komen breast cancer nonprofit. He won. But instead of writing a personal check for the helmet, he sent money from his foundation, which is mostly, according to the Washington Post\u2019s reporting, other people\u2019s money, donated with the intention of contributing to charity, not buying Trump helmets. Trump had not made a personal donation to his foundation for at least three years before he bought the helmet, the Post reported. Hello and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House. Donald Trump this morning is aggressively attacking Hillary Clinton over a meeting Monday on a Phoenix tarmac between Bill Clinton and attorney general Loretta Lynch. Lynch told reporters Wednesday that it was a chance meeting restricted to small talk. Trump, however, detects a conspiracy, conceived by the Clintons, to smooth Hillary Clinton\u2019s way to the presidency by arranging for a secret meeting between Bill Clinton and the head of a justice department currently investigating Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email account and server during her time as secretary of state. Under pressure from the furor over the secret meeting, Lynch plans to announce Friday that she will in effect recuse herself from the case and accept whatever recommendation career prosecutors and federal agents make in the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server, a justice department official told the Associated Press on Friday. Trump\u2019s not wholly reassured. \u201cDoes anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?\u201d he tweets. Here\u2019s how Lynch described the encounter at a news conference in Los Angeles Wednesday scheduled to discuss community policing: He did come over and say hello, and speak to my husband and myself, and talk about his grandchildren and his travels and things like that. That was the extent of that. And no discussions were held into any cases or things like that. The tempest, however, is already out of the teapot: In non-Clinton-conspiracy news, the veepstakes have not necessarily been reduced, on the Republican side, to former House speaker Newt Gingrich and New Jersey governor Chris Christie \u2013 but the two men are being seriously vetted as potential Trump running mates, according to many reports. MSNBC has this coverage this morning: Trump faces a significant fundraising deficit both inside his campaign and among the outside political groups that would support his candidacy. Potential and past donors retain reservations about the candidate, several told Peter Stone for the Guardian: Several donors backing Trump told the Guardian that the candidate\u2019s errors are piling up. \u201cHe\u2019s got to learn not to put his foot in his mouth,\u201d said Stan Hubbard, a billionaire broadcaster who has donated $100,000 to the pro-Trump Great America Pac. \u201cHe needs a clearer message without name-calling.\u201d Hubbard also called Trump\u2019s recent trip to Scotland \u2013 where he was criticized for hailing the plunge in the pound post-Brexit as good for his golf course there \u2013 a mistake. \u201cHe should have let his kids do it.\u201d Likewise, potential Super Pac donors say Trump badly needs to curb his bombastic rhetoric and craft a better message. Michael Epstein, who raised big money for Wisconsin governor Scott Walker and plans to vote for Trump but also \u201chold my nose and pray\u201d, said that he might back a Super Pac if Trump has a strong GOP convention next month and really \u201cturns it around\u201d. But Epstein added: \u201cI\u2019m less and less hopeful. He can\u2019t get out of his own way. He\u2019s going to have to demonstrate more presidential behavior, They\u2019re behind the eight ball and they\u2019ve got to move fast.\u201d Read further: At a campaign event in Manchester, New Hampshire, on Thursday, Trump joked that an airplane flying overhead was a Mexican attack: Thank you for reading and please join us in the comments."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
