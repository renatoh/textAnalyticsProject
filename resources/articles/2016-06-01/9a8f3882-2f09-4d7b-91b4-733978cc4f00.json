In his first public comments since last week\u2019s historic referendum vote, the owner of newspapers including the Times, Sun and Wall Street Journal said leaving the EU was like a \u201cprison break \u2026 we\u2019re out\u201d and suggested that a UK-US trade deal wouldn\u2019t take long to negotiate. Long seen as Eurosceptic, Murdoch kept quiet in the referendum campaign while his biggest-selling UK paper, the Sun, took a passionately anti-EU stance. At an invitation-only business summit hosted yesterday by the Times, which like many of its readers backed remain, Murdoch extolled the virtues of the Brexit vote and the campaign itself. Referring to England\u2019s disastrous 2-1 loss to Iceland in the Euro 2016 football match on Monday night, he compared the Brexit campaign to Iceland, a team playing to win, while remainers were like England, or \u201coverpaid players expected to be good\u201d. Murdoch\u2019s comments suggest that the Sun newspaper reflected his own Eurosceptic views, although the paper\u2019s editor, Tony Gallagher, has made no secret of his own dislike of the EU in a series of leaders since he was appointed last September. In a sign that Boris Johnson may not win immediate backing for any Conservative leadership campaign, Murdoch said that if Johnson backtracked on promises made during the referendum campaign on serious matters \u2013 presumably including immigration \u2013 this would trigger \u201canother bloody revolt\u201d. The owner of Fox television station and Sky also made positive comments about Trump, the Republican candidate for the US presidency, and compared his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, unfavourably to her husband."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
