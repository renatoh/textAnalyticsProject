A week that included three consecutive victories in the Premier League and Champions League has, he believes, made a big difference to team morale. \"The team is starting to rediscover our self-belief, our confidence in the group,\" he said. \"We need that. We have rediscovered our feeling for our game, the group is starting to gel and each of us are starting to understand our team-mates and find each other on the pitch.\" For Gervinho, who arrived from Lille over the summer, it has been an intense period of adaption to a new club, new league and whole new level of expectation. \"It's superb to have three consecutive wins now and we're starting to let go on the pitch and enjoy ourselves without pressure,\" he says. \"We're already thinking of the next game and winning it.\" That next game for him \u2013 assuming Ars\u00e8ne Wenger selects more of a shadow squad for the Carling Cup game against Bolton on Tuesday night \u2013 happens to be at Stamford Bridge. Away games at fellow top four aspirants have not gone well for Arsenal this season, with defeats at Manchester United and Tottenham cutting deep. Recent events have put that into a little more perspective. \"I was astounded to see Manchester United losing 6-1 to Manchester City but it shows that it can happen to all the teams,\" said Gervinho. \"On any given day a team can have a bad result. You can have a bad day but that does not make you a bad team. It's not because Arsenal conceded eight goals at United that we're a bad team. We've gone through a bad moment. We all need to win one game at a time to advance.\" Even if they have not always been at their most fluent, six wins from their last seven suggests that philosophy is working. Wenger singled out Gervinho for praise after his productive performance against Stoke. He scored once, created two goals and with his eager running was a nuisance to the visitors all afternoon. The way he clicked with Robin van Persie was encouraging and the Ivorian is hoping the Dutchman will stick around for the long term at Arsenal. \"We always need our best players so a player like Robin, frankly, we need him to stay longer at the club. It would please me if he stayed. I've just arrived at the start of this season and I would like him to stay so I can play with him a while longer. \"He is good for us psychologically. He's among the most experienced players on the pitch and when he enters the game he puts the opposition's defence under pressure and that helps our game. He's formidable and the team needs him. You always have to have leaders in the group and he's one of them who drags the team forward. He's the captain and his role is to galvanise the group and he assumes the responsibility.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
