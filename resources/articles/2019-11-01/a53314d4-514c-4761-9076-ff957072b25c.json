It is thought that Patrick will kick off his campaign on Thursday with a video, and then make an appearance in New Hampshire, so he can file paperwork to get on the state\u2019s vital early primary ballot, reported CNN. Patrick\u2019s last-minute entry into the race marks yet another change in the Democratic contest where nearly two dozen hopefuls have been competing for nearly a year, reported the New York Times. Nor is he likely to be the only late entrant as fears grow among centrist Democrats about the lackluster campaign of former vice-president Joe Biden and the stronger campaigns of the progressive senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The former New York mayor and billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg recently submitted paperwork for Alabama\u2019s Democratic primary. Patrick, who in late 2018 decided not to run, has already told Biden about his interest in the contest, according to the New York Times. Patrick is only the second elected black governor in US history and has told confidants that he would conduct a campaign similar to that of Barack Obama in 2008 \u2013 emphasizing unity. He has reportedly told some key Democrats that none of the other contenders have gathered wind, leaving space for a candidate who can appeal to liberals and moderates alike. Patrick, who counts Obama as a close friend, is nonetheless entering the competition at a disadvantage. He failed to meet the filing deadlines in Arkansas and Alabama. After leaving the governorship, Patrick also worked at Bain Capital \u2013 the financial firm in Boston co-founded by Mitt Romney. Bain could be problematic for Patrick, as other Democrats\u2019 criticism of the wealthy and the banking industry has been well received by many voters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
