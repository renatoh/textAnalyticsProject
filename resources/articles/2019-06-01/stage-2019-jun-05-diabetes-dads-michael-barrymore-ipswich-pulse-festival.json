She wants us to understand what it feels like to experience a diabetic hypo. Hugh Hughes is passing around a notebook. He wants feedback on his show about his father. Nick Cassenbaum is getting us to do just about everything: sing, holler and heckle. He wants us to fall back in love with his all-time hero, the impressionist and entertainer Michael Barrymore. All three of their shows \u2013 part of Ipswich\u2019s Pulse festival \u2013 ask the audience to share in real-life childhood experiences and reflect on innocence lost, fractured relationships, and the inspiring figures that carry us into adulthood. The title of Byrne\u2019s show, Pricks (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606), refers to her constant need to check her blood sugar level with a pinprick to the finger in order to manage her type 1 diabetes. Byrne did her first finger-prick test aged four, convinced she was going to die of \u201cdie-of-betes\u201d. These days her insulin levels are regulated with the help of an app on her phone, but it\u2019s a condition that demands constant attention, even if all Byrne wants to do sometimes is forget. Pricks is a little insular in places \u2013 more therapy than theatre \u2013 but it\u2019s also honest, informative and lit up by the deep affection that Byrne feels for her family, her protectors and her champions. We hear about her sister\u2019s patience and good humour, her mother\u2019s unwavering support, and her dad\u2019s mad dash to the hospital as his \u201cbaby\u201d experiences her first hypo \u2013 car abandoned in front of the hospital, keys still in the ignition and doors left wide open. Fathers haunt Hoipoilloi\u2019s new show The Ladder (\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606), too, although this time it\u2019s their absence that makes an impact. Sh\u00f4n Dale-Jones\u2019s alter ego, an emerging artist called Hugh Hughes, returns to the stage with a story about his dad and the rippling sense of loss that runs through his family. The show starts at the top of a ladder, where Hughes\u2019s father suffers a heart attack. It ends at the bottom, after dad\u2019s life has flashed before his eyes. Dale-Jones is a natural comic and his deadpan delivery and offbeat clowning with dad (Julian Spooner) can be very funny. But there\u2019s little shape or purpose to The Ladder, as we grind through oblique images and moments from his life. Michael Barrymore may not seem an obvious father figure but for Nick Cassenbaum, growing up during Barrymore\u2019s heyday in the 90s, this stratospherically popular TV star was everything. My Kind of Michael (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606) is Cassenbaum\u2019s homage to Barrymore\u2019s brand of entertainment in his heyday \u2013 before the 2001 death of Stuart Lubbock in his swimming pool. It is a hopeful, funny and palpably affectionate show. With the help of his pop-eyed pianist, Andy Kelly, Cassenbaum rattles through Barrymore\u2019s greatest hits and barmiest impressions. Buoyed by Cassenbaum\u2019s natural charisma and enthusiasm, the audience cheer wildly and, with amazingly little cynicism, join in with Cassenbaum\u2019s on-stage clowning. That cloying sense of suspicion and seediness that has set in around Britain\u2019s entertainment industry after the revelations about Jimmy Savile and others, momentarily seeps away. Just for a moment, we\u2019re young again. Ipswich\u2019s Pulse festival runs until 8 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
