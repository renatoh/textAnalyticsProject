But to be honest, he\u2019s lucky to still be within five, so badly did he play. Jordan Spieth wasn\u2019t firing on all cylinders either, not by a long chalk, but he battled and battled, grinding out an acceptable score, even if the wheels wobbled worryingly at the end. Spieth\u2019s still the favourite to retain his Masters title, but that dramatic finish suddenly makes tomorrow very interesting indeed. For a start, Bernhard Langer is two off the lead at 58 years of age! Please join us tomorrow! In the meantime, sleep tight. -3: Spieth -2: Kaufman -1: Langer, Matsuyama E: Day, D Johnson, Willett +1: Westwood, Snedeker, Kjeldsen +2: Berger, McIlroy Spieth hasn\u2019t hit his putt either! He\u2019s left himself a 12 footer for bogey! But first McIlroy, who has gone 80 consecutive rounds in the majors making at least one birdie. He\u2019s got this 12-footer, or that proud run is coming to an end. And yes, it\u2019s kaput. He lets it drift off to the left, and he\u2019ll be signing for a dismal 77. And then Spieth leaves his bogey effort out on the left, too! That\u2019s a bogey-double bogey finish and a 73 for Spieth, and this Masters is suddenly wide open! A very rare mistake by Spieth, as he quits on his wedge into the green. He reaches the putting surface, but he\u2019s left with a 50 footer up over the ridge running across the middle of the green. A difficult two putts for bogey, is the most realistic way of looking at this. Spieth, doubtless, will be thinking about draining it to save his par. Spieth smashes his ball low through the trees and out onto 18. That was a bit of a gamble, because there wasn\u2019t a huge gap there, but bravery pays off. He\u2019ll have a wedge in from 100 yards. McIlroy lifts a brilliant second pin high, off the bank on the right of the green to 12 feet. Incidentally the penultimate group of Danny Lee and Scott Piercy are in, both having capitulated to 79s. Lee\u2019s was a steady unravel; Piercy blew up on 15, chipping into the water at the front of 15 from the back of the green. Anyway, they\u2019ve both dropped back into the pack, at +5. Rory splits the 18th fairway, placing his drive in prime position. Spieth, however, has been erratic off the tee - it\u2019s been a strange round in that sense - and another drive flies off into trouble, down the right this time. That\u2019s deep in the trees. This is a poser all right, with no obvious route up 18, or even going rogue up the parallel 10th. Brandt Snedeker and Soren Kjeldsen are in the clubhouse with a pair of 74s. They\u2019ve dropped back to +1 today. Back on 17, McIlroy isn\u2019t miles away from draining his 30 footer, but this isn\u2019t his day. It skims by the hole, and he stays at +2. Spieth, who sent a very average wedge to 25 feet, can\u2019t scramble par for once, and he\u2019s been punished for his drive. He\u2019s back to -5. The lead\u2019s just three. Just! -5: Spieth (17) -2: Kaufman (F) -1: Langer (F), Matsuyama (F) Spieth finds his ball on some pine needles, and after a long deliberation, punches the ball back out onto a fairway through a gap in the trees. McIlroy finds the middle of the green, but that\u2019s asking his putter to write cheques it can\u2019t cash. \u201cCan\u2019t believe Spieth is not permanently on the clock,\u201d opines Mark Hughes. \u201cThe number of times he\u2019s backed off shots, irrespective of conditions is unbelievable. He\u2019s completely messing with Rory\u2019s flaky head. A masterclass in psychology, but it\u2019s not right.\u201d Erm, so having said that, Spieth flays his drive at 17 into the trees on the right. His ball clanks off a recalcitrant trunk, and off into dark trouble. He\u2019ll need a lucky break there. Rory splits the fairway, which usually doesn\u2019t qualify as breaking news, but certainly does today. \u201cWell we have an answer to the question about who would deal with the pressure better today!\u201d writes Craig McEwan. \u201cVery impressive play by Spieth. Rory will be disappointed he wilted. Could it be he needs someone else on the bag to help him when he wobbles?\u201d Matsuyama\u2019s birdie putt on 18 is always missing on the low side. His flat stick has cost him along the final stretch here. He signs for a level-par 72, and he\u2019s -1 going into Sunday. Meanwhile Spieth\u2019s bump onto the green at 16 isn\u2019t of the highest quality. He leaves himself another missable six footer. Thing is, he so rarely misses missable six footers. And this one is swallowed up by the hole too. He\u2019s a force of nature. Though it might have something to do with going out to practice three hours before his tee time, as well. Rory makes his par after an impressive lag, but already it feels like far too little, far too late. He throws his putter onto his bag in frustration. \u201cSir Nick Faldo has just described Willett\u2019s swing as \u2018commercial\u2019,\u201d reports Seamus Devlin. \u201cTwice just to prove it wasn\u2019t a mistake. I have no clue what that means but he is in with a great shout tomorrow. Can he win it?\u201d Quite a few players could win this, yes. They may need a little help from Jordan Spieth, though. He\u2019ll have a meltdown around Augusta National one day, and he\u2019ll never be quite the same again. Tomorrow afternoon maybe? Or sometime in April 2043? The latter\u2019s more likely, isn\u2019t it. Matsuyama gives himself a chance to repair some of the damage from 16 and 17 by creaming his approach at 18 pin high. He\u2019ll have a 15-footer for a birdie that\u2019ll add a spring to his step. Meanwhile on 16, neither Spieth nor McIlroy hit attractive tee shots, but Spieth\u2019s bounces off the bank to the right of the green and nestles in the fringe, while Rory\u2019s nearly rolls into the water on the left. Rory will be left with a long, long, long two putts for his par. Spieth and McIlroy have both laid up at 15. Spieth hits a crisp wedge to ten feet. Ice in the veins. McIlroy is just outside him. This is a putting shoot-out Rory can\u2019t afford to lose. But lose it he does, sending an appalling putt miles out to the left, a misread which curls six feet past the hole. A test coming back. But beforehand, Spieth slides in his left-to-right curler, and that\u2019s his third birdie in four holes. He\u2019s -6, four clear of the field. Rory knocks it in for par, but at +2 he\u2019s eight off the lead. In matchplay terms, this has been an embarrassing rout. Matsuyama\u2019s round is threatening to unravel at the death. He sends his second over the back of 17 and down the bank. He chips up well, but he\u2019s got a ten footer to avoid a second bogey in a row. He doesn\u2019t hit his right to left slider, though, and this is a bit of a miserable finish. He\u2019s back to -1. A hotter putter, and it could be so different. Willett got up and down from a similar position to Matsuyama a few minutes ago. Now on 18, he\u2019s a dimple away from draining a 30-foot birdie effort across the green. He settles for par, and a level-par 72. He\u2019s level par for the Tournament as well, and will be in one of the final few groups tomorrow. The amateur sensation Bryson DeChambeau will be no fan of the 18th hole. He took a triple-bogey seven there yesterday, and having found the woods and sand on it this time, takes a double-bogey six today. He signs for a 77, reality having kicked in a little on this very difficult day. Still, at +5 he\u2019s got nine shots over fellow amateur Romain Langasque, and should be winning the race for the silver medal tomorrow. McIlroy\u2019s second into 14 is decent, but nothing better. He\u2019s in the fringe at the back of the green, and though he gives his birdie effort a good go from 15 feet, it shaves the hole and doesn\u2019t drop. He\u2019s played appallingly, but he\u2019s also had no luck whatsoever. He looks a beaten man. But he needs to fight for a birdie or two, regroup in the clubhouse, and go again tomorrow. Though that might be too late. Spieth tickles in his birdie putt, and he\u2019s three ahead again. -5: Spieth (14) -2: Kaufman (F), Matsuyama (16) -1: Langer (F) E: Day (F), D Johnson (F), Willett (17) Matsuyama\u2019s tee shot into 16 is very average, near the water on the left, and he\u2019s got a long two putts uphill. He takes three, pulling another short one. Back to back three putts. He\u2019s back to -2, when he could feasibly be sharing Spieth\u2019s lead. Mind you, even that might have been very transitory, because Spieth\u2019s second into 14 is a marvel: he lands his ball on the left half of the green, letting the camber guide his ball round the back in a big semi-circle to seven feet. He\u2019ll have a very good look at a birdie that\u2019d give him a three-shot lead. That double on 11 seems an awfully long time ago already. A poor show on the 15th green by Matsuyama. He\u2019s on the putting surface in two, but takes three putts from 40 feet, pulling his short birdie effort. He stays at -4. The putting back on 13 isn\u2019t up to much, either: Spieth leaves his birdie effort five feet short, but salvages the par, while Rory\u2019s long trundle never bothers the hole. Par for him too. He needs something better. Meanwhile Big Dustin, having worked his way up the leaderboard to -1, bogeyed 17. And he\u2019s followed that up by missing the 18th fairway on the left, and then finding the bunker to the right of the green. But a gorgeous splash out to three feet saves the day. He signs for a level par 72, and he\u2019s level par going into the weekend. I\u2019m not sure what to think about Level Par Dustin. His meltdowns are so endearing. And yet it\u2019d be lovely to see him win a major at last. But you can\u2019t have your cake and eat it. God speed, big man. -4: Spieth (13) -3: Matsuyama (15) -2: Kaufman (F) -1: Langer (F) E: Day (F), D Johnson (F), Willett (16) Smylie Kaufman nearly curls one in from 25 feet at the back of 18, and signs for a superlative 69. He\u2019s -2 for the tournament, in third place on his own. Spieth lays up in front of the water at 13. McIlroy, from the pine needles, mishits back out onto the fairway. His head\u2019s gone. This is getting critical now, because he\u2019s still only six off the lead. Time for a couple of deep breaths, and relax. Spieth can only wedge his third to 40 feet, a poor effort. So the door\u2019s a little ajar for McIlroy. But he can\u2019t get any closer. McIlroy is all over the place. Literally. Having driven into trees down the left at 10 and 11, he\u2019s now wanging it into the pines to the right of 13. This isn\u2019t quite at the level of Sunday afternoon, 2011 , but it\u2019s difficult to watch nonetheless. The comparison of gamefaces between McIlroy and Spieth isn\u2019t flattering to the four-time major winner. It\u2019s beginning to look like he\u2019s been spooked by the emergence of Spieth. Hope I\u2019m being unfairly melodramatic about that. But the evidence of today doesn\u2019t stack up in his favour. Langer scrambles his bogey at 18! That\u2019s a round of 70 for the 58-year-old two-time Masters champion! A bogey that\u2019ll feel like ... well, not a birdie, but maybe a par. That was a fine bump up the bank to eight feet, and a wonderful putt for a player not renowned for his ability on the greens. He\u2019ll be -1 going into the final round. Jason Day meanwhile pars, and signs for a 71. He\u2019s level par, and within striking distance unless Spieth and/or Matsuyama turn on the jets. Spieth drains his birdie putt from the back of the green at 12! What a way to bounce back from that double-bogey nonsense at the 11th! He fist-pumps the air, he knows exactly what that\u2019s going to do to Rory. And it\u2019s going to mess with Rory\u2019s head, that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to do. He misses the short birdie putt, and this is turning into an utterly disastrous Saturday for McIlroy. He stays stuck at +2, while Spieth moves back to -4. Matsuyama meanwhile rakes one home across 14 for birdie, and he\u2019s staying on Spieth\u2019s shoulder at -3! Spieth finds the heart of 12, a fine tee shot. He\u2019ll have a 15-footer for birdie. But McIlroy\u2019s half the distance inside of him. Now\u2019s the time to strike? Meanwhile up on 18, Langer, things having gone so well for so long, is in a spot of trouble. He flirts with the trees from the tee, punches up the fairway, then hits a hot one straight through the green and over the back. He\u2019ll have a hell of a job getting up and down for bogey. On 15, Willett goes for the green in two, but he\u2019s nowhere near it, and finds the water. Now\u2019s not the time to be taking reckless gambles like that, two strokes off the lead. Kjeldsen meanwhile had bogeyed 10 and 11, but he\u2019s just curled in a birdie putt on 13 to move back to level par. A little chink of light for Rory and the rest of the field? Spieth, having shortsided himself in Larry Mize Country and knocked his chip 30 feet past the hole, rolled his bogey putt four feet past the hole - then missed the one coming back on the left. A pair of sixes from the biggest two names in world golf! That, patrons, is Amen Corner! And that, patrons, has changed the look of this Tournament utterly! -3: Spieth (11) -2: Langer (17), Kaufman (17), Matsuyama (13) -1: D Johnson (15), Willett (14) E: Day (17) \u201cBernhard Langer, the Tom Watson de nos jours?\u201d wonders Simon McMahon. \u201cBut who\u2019s in the Stewart Cink role? Not Sergio, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d Ah Sergio! What\u2019s he up to? Dropping shots hither and yon, that\u2019s what! Having started out with double bogey and birdie, he\u2019s dropped further shots at 3, 6, 9, 10, 11, and now 13. He\u2019s +8 for his round and for the tournament. Ah well, there\u2019s always Troon. Birdie for Willett at 14, grabbing back the shot he dropped on the previous hole. He\u2019s -1 again. Meanwhile McIlroy races his bogey putt ten feet past the hole. This is shambolic. However he gathers himself and knocks in for a double-bogey six. He\u2019s back to +2. Another birdie for Kaufman, who putts in from the fringe at 16. That\u2019s his third birdie in four holes: 13, 14, 16. And he\u2019s -2, in a tie for second with Langer and Matsuyama. Meanwhile Willett in trouble at the back of 13. A duffed chip doesn\u2019t make it to the putting surface, and that\u2019s a bogey that takes him back to level par. McIlroy drops and chips four to the fringe of 11, but he\u2019ll likely be making double bogey now. Spieth clanks his own chip 30 feet past the hole, though. That looks like bogey, though with Spieth\u2019s putting prowess you never know. More trouble for Rory, who is falling apart like wet cake. He pulls his drive at 11 into the trees down the left, and his ball rests near an unfriendly trunk. And the Masters could be drifting away from him. He tries to punch one out and hook it down towards the green, but overdoes it and the ball scampers into the water. That was completely idiotic, he should just have taken his medicine and chipped out. But now he\u2019s really up against it. Spieth pushes his second way right, into Larry Mize Country, and will have a job getting down in two. But that\u2019s not going to make McIlroy feel much better. McIlroy wedges his third into the heart of 10, and he\u2019s got a 15-footer uphill to save his par. But he doesn\u2019t hit that one, and he\u2019s back to level par now. He\u2019s five shots behind Spieth, who takes two putts for a par that keeps him at -5. Up on 16, Day couldn\u2019t match Langer\u2019s achievement of getting up and down from the back, and he\u2019s level par again. And birdie for Dustin at 13. He\u2019s right in this now! -5: Spieth (10) -2: Langer (16), Matsuyama (12) -1: Kaufman (15), D Johnson (14), Willett (12) E: Day (16), Piercy (10), McIlroy (10) Langer isn\u2019t too far away from a fourth birdie in a row, but his putt from the fringe at the back of 16 dies left from 20 feet. He taps in for par. On 12, Matsuyama leaves his tee shot short, just to the right of the bunker at the front, but he chips up to a few inches and taps in for par to remain at -2, alongside Langer. And a second dropped shot of the day for Scott Piercy, at 10, and he\u2019s back to level par. He\u2019s been moving backwards slowly but surely. Shades of 2011 on 10, as McIlroy hooks his drive into the woods down the left. He doesn\u2019t find the cabins this time, but he\u2019s forced to chip out back onto the fairway, taking his medicine. He really has to gather himself, and hang on in there. He\u2019s exuding panic. Spieth, by contrast, is the very essence of calm. He splits the fairway then eases an iron pin high to 15 feet. \u201cRory doesn\u2019t look happy playing with the machine that is Jordan Speith,\u201d argues Andy Gordon. \u201cHe might even be better off playing in the penultimate group tomorrow and concentrating on his own game instead of the distraction of what Speith is doing.\u201d Oh there\u2019s no concern about that right now. He\u2019ll be nowhere near the final group the way he\u2019s going right now. He needs to find a momentum changer, without pushing too hard to find it. Bernd Wiesberger has had an awful run today: bogeys at 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15, plus a double at 3. But this was nearly one of those memorable days, as his tee shot at 16 took two bounces towards the pin and was surely heading in for a hole in one! But it clanked the flagstick at slow pace and somehow stayed out. So unlucky! Coming in the group behind, Bernhard Langer, who threatens the flagstick himself though the ball scampers to the fringe at the back. His partner Jason Day is further up the bank to the right of the green, but they\u2019re both near the flag, and pars shouldn\u2019t be out of the question. Danny Willett clips his tee shot at 12 to eight feet, and guides in a gentle right-to-left slider. The birdie brings him under par for the competition. Meanwhile on 15, Day and Langer have peppered the flag: both will have ten footers for birdie. Langer pops it in, and that\u2019s three birdies in a row! Day can\u2019t follow him in, though, and it hooks out to the left. He\u2019ll stay at -1, but the 58-year-old two-time Master is in a tie for second at -2! More on Langer\u2019s birdie at 14: he chipped in from off the back of the green! That sent the gallery into ecstasy. A birdie for Kaufman on 13, and he\u2019s back to level par. And he\u2019ll be moving to -1, because he\u2019s just spun his second at 14 to six inches. Spieth and McIlroy meanwhile both send short irons into the heart of 9. Both balls threaten to spin back off the glacial green, but both hold on. Just. They\u2019ll have 30-feet looks at birdie. Spieth first, and his excellent putt somehow stays out on the left. He taps in for par, and he\u2019s out in 35. McIlroy up next, and though he\u2019s dead on line, he\u2019s left it five feet short. His flat stick is cold today. He\u2019s not looking confident at all. But he knocks his par putt in, and he\u2019s out in 38. Meanwhile bogey for Kjeldsen on 12 after visiting the bunker at the front. He\u2019s back to level par. One of the putts of the week by Jason Day! He\u2019s got a 70-footer across the warped-LP 14th green. And it drops, right to left to right and in! A punch of the air, and that\u2019s a huge bonus birdie! Back-to-back birdies, and all of a sudden he\u2019s -1, just four off the pace! As is Langer, who birdies the hole too! Matsuyama can\u2019t make his birdie on 10, dribbling it past the left edge, a disappointment given the quality of that second shot. Back on the 9th tee, Spieth finally finds a fairway - he hasn\u2019t really needed to do so, but still - and Rory follows him down there. Look at this leaderboard, though! The names on it! -5: Spieth (8) -2: Matsuyama (10) -1: Langer (14), Day (14), Kjeldsen (9), Piercy (9), McIlroy (8) McIlroy leaves an apologetic putt six feet short. He\u2019s in danger of letting this round unravel. But he knocks in the par save to stay at -1. He\u2019s still falling further behind, though, because Spieth taps in for his birdie, no more than his approach deserved. At -5, he\u2019s three clear of Matsuyama, though the young Japanese whirlwind has just skelped his second at 10 pin high to 12 feet, and will have a good look at birdie there. Justin Rose finished with a one-over 73. Given he was out in 40 strokes, that\u2019s a stupendous effort. Birdie at 16 wrapped things up there. He\u2019s +3 overall, and not quite out of this yet, providing Spieth doesn\u2019t do something immense. Lee Westwood also enjoyed himself on the back nine: birdies at 12, 13, 14 and 18, and he was back in 32. He signed for a one-under 71, and he\u2019s +1 overall. McIlroy has to take his medicine from the fairway bunker on 8 - the size of the lip! - and is left with 230 yards to the green. He crack-whips a long iron pin high! He\u2019ll have 35 feet across the green for birdie. Spieth, having taken a three wood off the tee, doesn\u2019t have the length to reach the green in two; another fairway wood sets him up for a wedge in. His third, from 101 yards, screeches to a halt five feet from the hole! That\u2019s a beauty. Unless his putter lets him down - and it so rarely does - he\u2019ll be moving into a three-shot lead again. Bernhard Langer for eagle at 13. He\u2019s an inch to the left away from draining an uphill one from 35 feet. He taps in for his birdie, and he\u2019s level par! His partner Jason Day guides a right-to-left downhill dribbler into the cup for birdie and a move back to level par too. The second-placed Matsuyama pars 9 to reach the turn in 35. Spieth\u2019s radar from the tee is all out of whack. He takes a fairway wood instead of driver on the par-five 8th, but still sends it out right. He\u2019s in better nick than McIlroy, though, who blasts his driver into a fairway bunker down the same side. McIlroy is beginning to look very frustrated. He needs to remember this is only Saturday, and he\u2019s just three off the lead. A long way to go, and no need to push too hard. But I suppose if you make one or two avoidable mistakes, it\u2019s only human nature to try to grab something back. Putting troubles for Jordan and Rory on 7. Spieth isn\u2019t too far away with his long attempt to save par, but his effort flies six feet past. McIlroy gives his downhill birdie effort an aggressive batter, and he\u2019s got eight feet coming back. He can\u2019t make the par saver, pulling it left. Bogey. Spieth isn\u2019t missing his bogey putt, though. So even though Spieth dropped one there, that\u2019s another hard-as-nails putt to limit the damage. His lead\u2019s only two, mind you, though it\u2019s not McIlroy breathing down his neck any more. -4: Spieth (7) -2: Matsuyama (8) -1: Kjeldsen (8), Piercy (7), McIlroy (7) Snedeker, in the fringe at the back of 8, trundles a birdle putt into the cup. If that didn\u2019t drop, that was away off the front. He really gave that a clack! That\u2019s turned him round after birdies at 4, 5 and 7. He\u2019s still one over for his round, but he\u2019s also back to level par for the Tournament, and feeling much better about himself. His partner Soren Kjeldsen chips to eight feet and rolls in for birdie. He\u2019s -1. Spieth\u2019s ball has stopped just short of the pine needles down the right. No unconscious patrons lying around, so that\u2019s good news. He whips an iron greenwards, but the wind catches it, and he\u2019s in the large bunker front left of the green. All he can do is punch out 40 feet past the hole. In fact he\u2019s lucky the slope doesn\u2019t take his ball off the green away to the right. That doesn\u2019t stop him hopping around in the irritated style. McIlroy meanwhile finds the heart of the green, and will have a downhill putt from 20 feet for birdie. A dropped shot for Smylie Kaufman at 11 and he\u2019s back to +1 And Willett, off the back of 9, very nearly chips in for birdie. He taps in, and he\u2019s out in 36, level for the championship. Spieth\u2019s been wayward from the tee today. He lashes his drive at 7 into the patrons down the right. Not sure whether that got into the trees or just clumped some poor bugger upside the head. McIlroy blooters his big stick down the middle. Up on 8, Matsuyama rolls an eagle effort from the best part of 80 feet to a couple of inches. He\u2019ll surely move to -2 and a share of second place with McIlroy. Bogeys for Langer and Day on 12; they\u2019re back to +1. And Dustin misses a 12-footer for birdie on 10. Spieth and McIlroy both clip tasty irons into the par-three 6th. McIlroy into the heart of the green, Spieth just off the back. McIlroy has a long, straight-ish uphill putt. He doesn\u2019t quite hit it, and it dies right. Par. Spieth, from the fringe back left, takes the pin out and races an aggressive chip at the hole. It stays on the high side, before racing eight feet past the hole. He\u2019ll have a tester coming back. But he\u2019s made par saver after par saver this week. And he does it once again! He\u2019s making something that is very, very difficult look like a breeze. Just the four players under par for the week! -5: Spieth (6) -2: McIlroy (6) -1: Matsuyama (7), Piercy (6) E: Langer (11), Day (11), Kaufman (10), D Johnson (9), Willett (8), Kjeldsen (7) It doesn\u2019t feel right to type this, but Dustin Johnson has been solid all week. No great dramas. This is as close as we\u2019ve got: a right-to-left curler for birdie from the back of 9. It would see him out in 35, but it stops one dimple\u2019s width shy of its 20-foot journey. So unlucky! He stays at level par for the Tournament, and who doesn\u2019t want to see him involved in some capacity on the final day? Nobody, that\u2019s who! C\u2019mon big man. Another near miss on 11, where Jason Day very nearly knocks in a 40-footer, but the ball dies a couple of feet before the hole. He stays at level par as well. Danny Willett isn\u2019t a mile away with a 30-footer birdie effort up 8 either. Spieth apart, this is turning into a logjam at the top of the leaderboard. So the reason Spieth complimented McIlroy at 5, then. Both creamed their three woods down the fairway, but McIlroy had quite a distance advantage. So well done. But McIlroy did nothing with it. Spieth could only find the front of the huge green; McIlroy, 40 yards ahead of him, ended up five feet behind! But he nearly curls in a 60-foot monster, and taps in for par. So close to one of the week\u2019s outstanding birdies. But not quite. Spieth\u2019s up next, and though he\u2019s not so close, he\u2019s not missing the four footer he leaves himself. Par, and it\u2019s as you were. First Westwood, now Rose with a mini-revival. He was out in 40 after a terrible stumble between 4 and 7: bogey, bogey, bogey, double bogey. He\u2019s just raked in a long one on 16 for birdie, his fourth in six. He\u2019s back to +3 overall, and like many competitor, not out of this, providing Spieth stumbles a little. Lee Westwood went out in 39, but he\u2019s turned it around magnificently. Birdies at 12, 13 and now 14, after guiding his ball from left to right around the banking at the back of the green and back towards the pin, real wall-of-death stuff. He\u2019s +2 overall. Day misses a tiddler for birdie at 10, his putt pulled to the left. Soren Kjeldsen, who started out bogey-bogey, arrests the slide with birdie at 6; he\u2019s back to level par. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing that hasn\u2019t been said before, but Jordan Spieth is ridiculous,\u201d writes Matt Dony. \u201cStill not even 23. Technique and ability to spare, but his mental strength seems almost unshakeable, which seems so at odds with his \u2018nice, polite young man\u2019 appearance and demeanour. He seems almost too perfect. I almost hate him.\u201d Ha! Yes. It\u2019s impossible, though, isn\u2019t it. He\u2019s a class act, in just about every respect. He even complimented Rory for outdriving him on 5 a couple of minutes ago. News of Danny Willett, who opened up today with bogeys at 1 and 4. He\u2019s just carded back-to-back birdies at 6 and 7, the latter after stroking in a 20-footer from the back of the green. He\u2019s back to level par for his round, and for the Tournament. Also a catch-up with Jamie Donaldson, who we last heard of eagling at 2. It\u2019s not been going so well. He doubled 7, dropped another at 11, birdied 13 and doubled again at 14. He\u2019s back down at +5, heading in the wrong direction today. A couple of strokes of luck for Spieth and McIlroy on 4. Or perhaps a couple of clanks of luck. Both tee shots clatter off the grandstand on the left, and rebound in front of the bunker to the left of the hole. Both have a pitch at the hole. Spieth leaves his eight feet short, but McIlroy nearly holes his. Spieth once again scramble his par: his 13th successful effort from 16 attempts this week. Unsurprisingly, that\u2019s the best in the field. He stays at -5, three ahead of McIlroy, who tidies up for his par too. That\u2019s his best showing at 4 this week; it\u2019s cost him three strokes already. Another bogey meanwhile for Snedeker, this time at 5, and he\u2019s back to level par. Scott Piercy leaves his tee shot at the par-three 4th short of the green. He\u2019s always chasing his score. He nearly curls in a 25-foot right-to-left curler to save his par, but doesn\u2019t quite hit it. He\u2019s back to -1. His partner Danny Lee misses a short par putt, pulling it left from three feet. A second bogey of the day and he\u2019s back to level par. Bogey for Langer at 9; he\u2019s out in 35 and level for the Tournament. His partner Day birdies, and he\u2019s out in 35 too; he\u2019s level par after a bogey-birdie start. Spieth clips a magnificent chip, with a lot of check spin, across 3. His ball stops three feet to the right of the cup, leaving a very makeable uphill par saver. Clever. McIlroy can only knock his third 15 feet past the cup, and he\u2019s got a treacherous downhill putt to save his par. It\u2019s got a huge swing, too. He judges the line well, but perhaps understandably doesn\u2019t quite hit it. Bogey, and he drops back to -2. Spieth taps in for his par and suddenly he\u2019s got a three-shot lead! -5: Spieth (3) -2: Piercy (3), McIlroy (3) -1: Langer (8), Matsuyama (4), Snedeker (4), Lee (3) Another birdie for Bernhard Langer! The veteran German picks up a stroke at the par-five 8th, and moves back up to -1! His playing partner Jason Day however misses a tiddler and has to settle for par; he stays at +1. Back on 3, Spieth punches out from the trees on the right, up and onto the green. His ball topples off the left-hand side, just. McIlroy wedges onto the front of the green, but his ball spins back in the hectic fashion, and he\u2019s back down the fairway. Both have some work to do there. Meanwhile bogey for Snedeker on 4, and he\u2019s back to -1. Spieth has the honour at 3, and he slices his drive deep into the trees down the right. McIlroy again finds sand with his tee shot, on the left of the fairway. He\u2019ll be able to reach the green, but that\u2019s a treacherous one both at front and back, so finding the right amount of spin will be a serious issue there. McIlroy sends his wedge pin high to ten feet. He\u2019ll have a look at birdie from there. It\u2019s one he might have to make, because Spieth should be picking up at least a stroke here. Spieth to putt first, for his eagle. It\u2019s not a particularly good effort, clacked with purpose towards the hole, but misread, the ball breaking wildly to the right. He\u2019s left himself a four-footer, albeit one with a lot of movement. That\u2019s not a gimme. McIlroy next, though - and he prods his, across sheet glass, to the left of the hole. He\u2019ll have some work to do coming back. The tension is already palpable, and it\u2019s only the second hole on Saturday! Spieth prowls around his birdie putt, and tucks it away. First blow to the leader, who moves to -5. Rory has to make his par, and even though he\u2019s got to putt through his shadow, in it goes. Matsuyama bogeyed 3, incidentally. -5: Spieth (2) -3: McIlroy (2) -2: Snedeker (3), Piercy (2) -1: Matsuyama (4), Lee (2) McIlroy drives into the bunker to the right of 2. He takes his medicine and doesn\u2019t go for the green, laying up and hoping his wedge will do the trick. Up on the green, Scott Piercy, from the fringe at the back, nearly bumps one in for his birdie, but has to settle for a second par. Then once the green\u2019s vacated, Spieth, from the second cut on the left, lashes a long iron into the front of the green. That\u2019s a beauty, and he\u2019ll have a 30-foot uphill chance for eagle. Meanwhile news of Jason Day, who made a bogey-birdie start: he\u2019s just sunk two medium-length par savers on 6 and 7, hanging on in there at +1. Spieth and McIlroy both find the centre of the 1st green, but they both have long putts for birdie. Spieth leaves his 40-footer four feet short; a little test to save his par. McIlroy gets his distance right, but his line a little wrong; he\u2019s got a little tester for par, too, the ball turning five feet to the left. These are crucial putts, because this round will have a whiff of matchplay about it. Rory first - and he holes without fuss. Par. Spieth next - and he\u2019s not messing about either, tapping home a short one that nevertheless had a little right-to-left about it. Ahead of this pair, Danny Lee had bogeyed 1 to drop to -1, while on 2, Brandt Snedeker birdies to move to -2 and a share of second. Already these are exciting times, with the leaderboard having suffered a minor shoogle: -4: Spieth (1) -3: McIlroy (1) -2: Matsuyama (2), Snedeker (2), Piercy (1) -1: Lee (1) Sergio\u2019s chipping has let him down this week. A small meltdown at the front of 9 yesterday cost him a couple of strokes. And he\u2019s unravelled on the very first hole today, too, failing to get up from the bank to the left of the green. A double to open, a birdie on 2, and another bogey at 3, and he\u2019s back down to +2. Another European going in the wrong direction quickly is Shane Lowry, who has opened with four bogeys in a row. He\u2019s +4, and nothing much as gone right for the Irish star since that front nine of 31 on Thursday. A quick start for the young Japanese sensation Hideki Matsuyama. A fifth-place finish here last year; he\u2019s got the game to win. And could this be his breakthrough major? Why not? He\u2019s just birdied 2, and moves to -2 overall. Langer, sadly, has just bogeyed 6 to drop back to level par. So I\u2019m glad we put up that leaderboard when we did. And Smylie Kaufman, the 24-year-old from Alabama playing in only his second major and first Masters, has birdied 2 and is one under for his round through 5. He\u2019s level par for the Tournament. OK, so this is what the world has been waiting for: the final pairing of Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy. The Jack and Arnie de nos jours. Or the Jack and Tom. Or Nick and Greg. Or Tiger and Phil. Ah you know what I mean. They both split the fairway, and it, my golfing buds, is ON! But never mind Jeff Knox! The real story so far today is the fiftysomething two-time champ Bernhard Langer! The 1985 and 1993 winner birdied 2, and now he\u2019s added another to his card at 5. He\u2019s two under for his round, and -1 overall. He\u2019s three off the lead! So just before Spieth and McIlroy tee off, what better excuse to show where he stands on the leaderboard: -4: Spieth -3: McIlroy -2: Lee, Piercy -1: Langer (5), Matsuyama (1), Snedeker (1) Bernhard Langer, though! Bubba Watson, the 2012 and 2014 winner, shot a 76 today, to go with his pair of 75s. Not ideal. But probably enough to see off his marker, the Augusta National member, course-record holder, and cult figure Jeff Knox. Word is that Knox didn\u2019t finish every hole, and they\u2019re very fastidious about scoring around here. Just ask poor old Roberto De Vicenzo. So Bubba wins. In any case, details might be sketchy, because the club have by all accounts been getting a little cagey about Knox\u2019s exploits, as they think he might be getting too much attention. However, it\u2019s not been a total media lockdown, because here he is draining a monster on 13: You could sell that one to Jordan or Rory for a few quid. Thanks to Niall there. Several Aston Villa supporters were in that darkened room. They don\u2019t want to come out. They were holding their knees to their chest and rocking quite a lot. Anyway, to the brighter but very windy Augusta National. Good news for young Bryson DeChambeau: the spiritual love-child of Payne Stewart and Chevy Chase has birdied 2, to pick up the shot he dropped at the opening hole, Tea Olive. He\u2019s back to level par, and I\u2019m liking this guy a lot. His response last night to being asked whether he could win wasn\u2019t far off a sulky teenager\u2019s \u201cUh, yeah, stupid.\u201d As though he\u2019d been asked the most ridiculous question in the world. But it wasn\u2019t arrogance, just simple self-belief. He did think it was a ridiculous question. Because he backs himself to win. Which is why he almost certainly will, a lot, when he turns pro. Not here, this week, though, surely? Hmm. The spirit of Bobby Jones will be on his side, so rule nothing out. I\u2019m handing back to Scott now, who has emerged from a darkened room and will lead you all the way to the close of play, as Spieth and McIlroy go toe-to-toe. Enjoy! DeChambeau strikes the ball low, which has helped him hit greens in breezy conditions all week. He lost his way on the first, and needs to stop the rot after dropping four shots in his last three holes. Lowry and DeChambeau, a pairing whose names alone ooze collective sophistication, have both bogeyed the first. Which is disappointing. Jason Day has birdied the second to get back to +1. He\u2019s off at 2.30pm local time, 7.30pm UK time, alongside Soren Kjeldsen, and he\u2019s certainly in with a shout. Louis Oosthuizen is the first man to finish his third round under par; the South African went round in 71, and will go into the final round on +4 overall. Bill Haas, -1 for the day and on the 16th, could also make it to the clubhouse with a smile on his face. England\u2019s Danny Willett is teeing off shortly alongside your friend and mine, Sergio Garc\u00eda. Can the mercurial Spaniard beat his best ever finish \u2013 joint fourth in 2004? A couple of British names getting swept away in the stiff breeze: Justin Rose, who has dropped five shots in four holes, sliding from +1 to +6. Yowza! Jamie Donaldson has also double-bogeyed the seventh, but things are less drastic for the Welshman at +3 overall. Bernhard Langer has birdied the second to move into the top ten! The two-time Masters winner is leading the veterans\u2019 charge this year, reckons Ewan Murray: At the other end of Amen Corner, Adam Scott gets in a right state on the 13th, but manages to scrape a par. He\u2019s two over for the day, +6 overall. The group on six over are tied for 35th, but not entirely out of contention, ten strokes behind Spieth. Henrik Stenson, three over today to slide to +6 and out of contention, misses a shot at birdie at the 11th. Playing partner Hunter Mahan misses a bogey putt \u2013 that\u2019s his second double bogey today, to go with two bogeys and two birdies. An up and down day. Day bogeys the first, faltering with his chipped approach to the green to slip back to +2, some six strokes behind Jordan Spieth. Teeing off shortly: Dustin Johnson at 1.50pm Augusta time, with Shane Lowry and amateur hero Bryson DeChambeau starting ten minutes later. Patrick Reed, on +7 after going two over so far today, lines up a downhill, down wind birdie putt on the 15th, but it rolls a few feet short. On the 16th, Oosthuizen taps in a short putt to save par. Thanks, Scott. I\u2019ve just slipped out of my Grand National silks and into a fetching pair of plus fours. World No1 Jason Day, starting on +1, has just teed off, as we work our way towards the business end of the field. Brooks Koepka picks up a birdie on the second, and he\u2019s one under for the day, on par overall. Penny for Greg Norman\u2019s thoughts. Larry Mize picked his pocket on 11 in the 1987 play-off, still one of the more ludicrous major-championship heists of all time. The Great White Shark will be wondering why Mize couldn\u2019t have wanged his approach into the drink that fateful day, instead of bailing out to the right, from where he preposterously chipped in for victory. Mize has obliged today, 29 years too late. A double bogey, and that\u2019s his seventh shot dropped in the last eight holes. He\u2019s +9. That birdie-birdie-birdie start seems a while ago now. But then so does 1987. So having started wittering, and in order to shovel some Hamburger Helper down my throat, I\u2019m going to hand over to Niall McVeigh, who will treat you with love and respect for the next hour. See you soon! And now Webb Simpson moves back into the red. He was one of the few players to have earlier experienced the sweet taste of credit, having birdied 2, only to double at 7. But birdie at 8, followed now by another at 13, has moved the 2012 US Open champion back up to +4. So Simpson, Streelman and Donaldson are all under par for their rounds today. It\u2019s getting to be quite the gang. Kevin Streelman has chipped in from 60 yards up the 2nd fairway for eagle. Like Donaldson before him, he\u2019d bogeyed the opening hole before eagling the next; like Donaldson before him, he rises to +1. Meanwhile Lee Westwood and Paul Casey are out together, English nearly men on tour. Both have started bogey-birdie; both are +2 overall. Justin Rose has bogeyed 4, and so Jamie Donaldson is now the only player out on the course under par for his round today. There are 35 men out there. It\u2019s fair to say the combination of wind and glacial greens is causing all manner of bother. Birdie for Rose at 3. He rises to +1. That 77 yesterday has probably left him with too much to do. It wasn\u2019t a good performance, though it also wasn\u2019t all his fault: having the ball hit the flag at 13, then bounce back into Rae\u2019s Creek, was enough to take the wind out of his sails. But he\u2019s a level-headed sort, and he\u2019s got a good record here, with near misses last year and back in 2007. So if he posts something relatively low today, you never know. Meanwhile the wheels have come clanking off Rafael Cabrera-Bello\u2019s birdie bandwagon. He\u2019s had a miniature meltdown with the flat stick on 5, in the style of Jordan Spieth yesterday, and walks off with a triple-bogey seven. He\u2019s now one over for his round, +4 overall. It doesn\u2019t take long round here, does it. Make that two players: Billy Horschel has bogeyed 3 to drop back to +3 again. Justin Rose is out, incidentally: he\u2019s opened with a pair of pars. I would have said he\u2019s following Adam Scott\u2019s lead, but the 2013 champion\u2019s run of pars has come to an end at the long par-five 8th, a result of lashing his drive into bother down the left of the hole. Meanwhile here\u2019s our main man in Augusta, with a small but significant insight into the relentless brilliance of Jordan Spieth ... By the way, if you missed Ewan\u2019s highly entertaining account of swinging his way around Augusta National, now\u2019s the perfect time to catch up. We\u2019re never going to play there ourselves, so we might as well shoot 121 vicariously. Eagle for Jamie Donaldson! The Welsh Ryder Cup star opened his account today with a bogey at Tea Olive, but he\u2019s instantly moved into red figures by sinking a 66-foot eagle effort from the front of the large green at the par-five 2nd. He springs up to +1, and is one of only three players out there under par for his round today. Ian Poulter had a miserable day yesterday, shooting a 78 bereft of birdies, and his downward spiral continues. Bogeys at 1 and 3, and that opening round of 69 seems a long time ago now. He\u2019s +5. Matt Kuchar has bogeyed 6 - he\u2019s +4 - while Harris English slips back to +3 after bogey at 5. Their membership of today\u2019s under-par club is taken up by Billy Horschel, who has birdied 2 to move to +2. This isn\u2019t so much Moving Day as Gently Oscillating Day. The wind might need to die down a bit before things pick up. Par save of the day might already have been made. Charley Hoffman has been all over the place today - bogeys at 1, 3 and 5 - and the 7th was no different. He hoicked his drive into the trees down the right, hacked into more bother down the side of the hole, then dumped his third into the deep bunker at the front of the green. Sure enough, he splashed out delicately, sending a perfectly weighted escape scampering into the cup! The gallery erupts. A huge smile plays across his face - and he\u2019s so busy grinning at his caddy that he nearly falls back into the bunker. He stays at +7, so this is inconsequential on one level, but sport\u2019s not just about results, and that\u2019s a lovely warm moment. Cabrera-Bello appears to be in the mood to buck the general trend. Birdie at 2 now, after lobbing over sand to a couple of feet, and tapping in to move to +1. He\u2019s a man in form, after a good showing at the WGC Cadillac and third place at the World Match Play. Confidence will be high. A few folk were talking him up at the start of the week. In truth, he\u2019s unlikely to become the third Spanish winner of this event after Seve Ballesteros and Jose-Maria Olazabal, but he\u2019d be a decent-enough each-way bet. Certainly if he keeps on in this manner. Harris English joins the small group in red numbers, meantime: after bogey at 1, he\u2019s birdied 2 and now 4 to move to +2. The Mize Bell Curve is complete. He bogeys 6, and he\u2019s back where he started at +5. Three birdies followed by three bogeys. Ah, hold on, make that four. He\u2019s just shipped another at 7, and now he\u2019s +6. Greg Norman will be wondering why he couldn\u2019t have carried on like this 29 years ago. So there are just two players under par for their rounds so far. The aforementioned Matt Kuchar, and Spain\u2019s Rafael Cabrera-Bello, who opens with a birdie at Tea Olive. He\u2019s +2. Adam Scott registers his sixth par of the day at 6. Under normal circumstances this would be nothing special, but the winds are really whipping around Augusta National right now. So much for Moving Day. Maintenance rather than movement is the watchword right now. The later starters will be thanking their lucky stars the wind is due to drop around 2pm local time. Jason Day and Dustin Johnson might be the last big names to catch the tail end of the unsettled conditions; it should be more manageable once the Garcias, Matsuyamas, McIlroys and Spieths come out to play. How much more manageable remains to be seen. But the wind could easily stretch the field, one way or the other. Trouble at t\u2019mill on 3. Hunter Mahan tied for ninth place last year, the third top-ten Masters finish of his career. He\u2019s extremely unlikely to be making it four this time round. He whistles his approach to 3 long and wide right, then clumps his chip back through the green and off the front. He can only chip up to 20 feet, and he\u2019s not getting that left-to-right curler in for bogey. A double, and he crashes down to +7. His playing partner Henrik Stenson meanwhile, from the back of the green putts off the front. A double for him as well. He\u2019s +5. Larry Mize isn\u2019t so much on a rollercoaster but a bell curve. Birdies at 1, 2 and 3, then that bogey at 4. And now another bogey at 5. A par would be nice. He\u2019s back to +4. What Augusta National gives, it also takes away, and then usually takes away some more, so the 1987 champ better watch out. Matt Kuchar has enjoyed an equally eventful start. Bogey at Tea Olive, followed by birdies at 2 and 3. He\u2019s +3 overall. Just three players under par for their rounds today: Mize, Kuchar and Webb Simpson. Early days, of course, but still: God speed, everyone! Hunter Mahan\u2019s second into the par-five 2nd is a facsimile copy of Louis Oosthuizen\u2019s famous albatross shot from the final day in 2012. Problem is, the hole\u2019s not in the same place; in fact it\u2019s on the other side of the green. He rolls a 60-foot eagle putt across the dancefloor to four feet, and should knock in the birdie effort. But he pushes it right, and has to settle for par. He\u2019ll not be reclaiming the shot he dropped at 1. He\u2019s +5. His playing partner Henrik Stenson, just turned 40, has started par-par and remains at +3. Meanwhile it\u2019s fair to say these greens haven\u2019t got a whole lot easier today. On 7, Justin Thomas double bogeys, having taken four putts. He\u2019s 56th of the 57 players in the field: Bubba is propping the leaderboard up, having bogeyed 9 to go out in 39. He\u2019s +9. It\u2019s almost as though he\u2019s lost interest. The Larry Mize fairytale had to end sometime. And it does so at 4. Bogey, and he\u2019s back to +3. Kisner\u2019s going backwards too, with bogey on 7 that drops him to +4. On 3, Scott finds a fairway bunker with his driver, and he\u2019s up against a high lip. He tosses a beautiful wedge high into the air and onto the back of the green, where it spins back to 30 feet. That\u2019s a fine outcome from where he was. By way of comparison, his playing partner Charley Hoffman, from a perfect spot in the centre of the fairway, gets no spin whatsoever on his wedge into the green, and he\u2019s more than twice the distance outside Scott. After bogey at the opening hole, this is a pretty poor start for Hoffman. He takes a 70-foot trundle at his birdie, and watches in horror as the ball kinks off to the right, 20 feet from the hole. Scott\u2019s huge left-to-right curler stops five feet short. Par yet again. Hoffman can\u2019t save his, though, and he\u2019s back to +6. All the fault of his wedge. Adam Scott was hotly tipped to win his second Green Jacket this week. He looked like missing the weekend action yesterday, before nearly holing in one at 12: birdie there, plus others at 15 and 18, saw him safe and snug, well above the cut line at +4. A quick start today and he could be onto something. But it\u2019s not happening. A fairly solid par at Tea Olive, then a 350-yard drive down the par-five 2nd. He fails to parlay prime position into a birdie. From the front of the green, he\u2019s putting long for eagle, but leaves it well short, and his ten-foot effort for birdie is never going in. To add insult to injury, as he walks off the green he juggles his ball with his putter, drops it, and takes a fresh air swipe at trying to catch it before it hits the turf. That\u2019s not going to bolster confidence. A third birdie in a row for Larry Mize! This time at 3! What a start! The veteran and local hero could sell that to the rest of the field for a fair old sum. He\u2019s +2. And there\u2019s another birdie for Kevin Kisner, at 6: he\u2019s +3. Proof that there\u2019s a score out there if someone really fights for it. On the flip side, though, there are 17 players currently out on the course, and only four of them are in red figures for the day. There have been some early red numbers. Kevin Kisner has birdied 3, Victor Dubuisson and Webb Simpson have picked up shots at 2, and the 1987 Masters champ Larry Mize has flown out of the blocks with birdies at 1 and 2. He\u2019s +3 all of a sudden. That\u2019s only seven strokes off the lead, so there\u2019s hope for everyone if they can string together a few good holes. The two-time champions Bubba Watson had the most ground to make up - he was the only player at +6, just avoiding the halfway cut - but any hopes of a golfing fairytale are all but extinguished. He\u2019s bogeyed 3 and 4 to drift out to +8. He\u2019s got a tendency to switch off in these sort of circumstances. If he does, expect him to be outscored today by his marker, the Augusta cult hero Jeff Knox, who as Augusta tradition demands will make up the odd-numbered draw. Knox has already outscored the likes of Craig Stadler and Rory McIlroy in the past. Oh, and Sergio Garcia, who departed in that lofty vehicle, high dudgeon. A two-time Masters champ would be Knox\u2019s biggest prize yet. We\u2019ll keep you posted. Here we go, then: Moving Day! And we can indeed expect a lot of movement. A fair bit of it backwards, no doubt: the wind is still whipping around like a whirligig. It is, however, expected to drop by the time the leading lights make their way out, from 2pm ET onwards. Good news for the later starters, then, a little treat for doing so well on Thursday and Friday. Welcome to day three of the second Jordan Spieth Augusta Procession . So much for that draft. Things changed quickly, didn\u2019t they? At around 2pm local time yesterday, the reigning Masters champion had a five-stroke lead on the field. He was the only player picking up shots on a rock-hard course battered by wind, as the chasing pack floundered en masse. A weekend of competitive golf began to look like a pipe dream. He had a four-stroke lead over the field, a six-stroke advantage over Rory McIlroy. And then he four-putted at 5. The seeds of doubt took a while to shoot up. But by the end of the day, Spieth had carded four more bogeys, and ended up signing for a 74, his first over-par round in a short but stellar Masters career. Meanwhile McIlroy picked up birdies at 13, 15 and 16 on his way home, scribbled his name at the bottom of a 71, and we\u2019ve got ourselves a tournament! -4: Spieth -3: McIlroy -2: Lee, Piercy -1: Snedeker, Kjeldsen, Matsuyama E: Aphibarnrat, Willett, Garcia, Lowry, DeChambeau, D Johnson, Berger Pretty much perfect, then, as this is what everyone\u2019s been waiting for: a Spieth versus McIlroy shootout in a major. And it\u2019s only Saturday! Imagine if they keep trading blows all weekend. It\u2019s certainly not beyond the realms, because both players are already fighting tooth and nail for every precious stroke: witness the way they both scrambled magnificent pars on 18 yesterday, to make their evening meals taste that little bit sweeter. This isn\u2019t just about Spieth and McIlroy, though. Most, and maybe all, of the 57 players remaining will still harbour hopes of winning the Green Jacket; they made it to the weekend thanks to the ten-shot rule, after all. In 1956, Jack Burke won from eight back at the halfway mark; he was nine behind coming into the final round. In 1978, Gary Player won from eight back with 18 holes to play. And in 2016? With the course likely to pose another tough challenge today, before being set up for a birdie blitz tomorrow, anything is possible. What a weekend we have in store! It didn\u2019t look like it for a while, but this, dear patrons, is on! We\u2019ll get going at 4pm BST, which is 11am in the sweet Georgia town of Augusta.
