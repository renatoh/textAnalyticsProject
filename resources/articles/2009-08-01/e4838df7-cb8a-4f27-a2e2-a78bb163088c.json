Too much jealousy. Everyone wants to knock them down but I hope they do really well. They have not broken any rules. They have paid the money, they are not doing it with backhanders, it's legitimate money. So good luck to them, I say.\" Those are magnanimous words given that Hart could conceivably be thought of as one of the victims of the Abu Dhabi United Group's \u00a3235m splurge. Hart is not the first young English goalkeeper to be tagged the \"next big thing\", but he had shown more than most that he fitted the bill until the overhaul got under way. Then came the news that Shay Given was being signed from Newcastle United to take his place, followed by several unhappy months of sitting on the bench, wondering what he had done wrong and hoping to find a club where he could feel more wanted. He is at Birmingham City now, on a season-long loan, and relishing once again the sense of having a manager who is confident enough to believe he is equipped for the Premier League now rather than being one for the future. Alex McLeish has immediately installed him as his first-choice goalkeeper, taking over from Maik Taylor, and Hart could be forgiven for thinking he has had a good start. Wayne Rooney's winner for Manchester United is the only goal he has conceded in Birmingham's first three games back in the top division going into tomorrow'smatch at Tottenham Hotspur and it is not a huge leap of logic to believe that Fabio Capello will be monitoring him closely. For Hart, however, there are other considerations. \"People say to me, 'Well, it's a World Cup year so you had to do this now' and I know where they are coming from but, honestly, that wasn't the thinking behind this move,\" he says. \"The World Cup could have been this summer or three years away and I still would have wanted to get a new club. I had to play, you see. It's job satisfaction and I've got that here. The manager has been great to me and given me the opportunity to play straight away; that's the whole point of being in this industry, isn't it? To play, to be in the limelight, to enjoy the game. But that had gone for me at Man City.\" Hart's gratitude to McLeish stands out \u2013 \"I just want to repay him,\" he says more than once \u2013 and even if he still talks about Manchester City with obvious affection it is clear, too, that he found it a chastening experience when Given was signed to take his place. \"I just laughed,\" he says, but he is shaking his head when he says it. \"I didn't know what to think, to be honest. I'd heard people talking about it happening. It was in the papers. So I approached people at the club and asked if it was true. They said, 'Nothing is final and ra ra ra.' Then, right at the end of January, Shay was training with us. I just had to accept it because what else could I do? I just thought, 'Whatever!' But there was no point being bitter or stroppy about it. \"I was comfortable about how I had done. OK, I wasn't perfect, but which goalkeeper is? I still felt I had been playing well but he [Mark Hughes] felt he had to bring in another goalkeeper and I suppose it his job to make those decisions. What I would say is that everyone else I spoke to at that time was really supportive. All the supporters were really appreciative of what I had done and how I had been playing.\" The fact he has signed on loan, with Hughes unwilling to sanction a permanent transfer, does at least suggest there could still be a future for Hart in Manchester and that the world's most financially endowed club remain appreciative of the potential he has shown since becoming a part of the Shrewsbury Town squad at the age of 15. Hart was a year-11 pupil at Meole Brace School Science College when Shrewsbury asked for permission to take him out of class. \"I can still remember the head teacher asking to see me one day,\" Hart recalls. \"Shrewsbury had only two keepers and one was injured. I'd been training with them in my school holidays and I suppose I was the next best option they could think of. They were playing Exeter away so I had to have the Friday off school to travel down. A couple of my mates from school came, too. Then, suddenly, I was in a dressing room full of men rather than other kids. So I had to learn fast.\" Hart had grown up in Shropshire in a family dominated by Wolverhampton Wanderers supporters and, as well as excelling at football, the former head boy was also a talented cricketer. \"I played for Worcestershire in the same group of kids from which Steve Davies [an England one-day wicketkeeper] came through. I was a bowler \u2013 left arm, smash it down as fast as I could. I did a lot of work with Damian D'Oliveira and I probably had a chance of doing that for a living. But when I reached 16 I knew I couldn't carry on playing both football and cricket and I was already in the Shrewsbury squad.\" He made his first-team debut on the day after his 17th birthday and was signed by City for \u00a3600,000, possibly rising to \u00a31.5m, when Stuart Pearce was manager in 2006. He is now 22, which might be young in football terms, particularly for a goalkeeper, but he has already played almost 150 senior games, including his first full England cap against Trinidad &amp; Tobago 15 months ago. That occasion stands out as the proudest moment of his career to date \u2013 even if he remembers \"having nothing to do\" \u2013 but Hart's short career so far has also incorporated some difficult moments. One, clearly, was the sudden realisation that his No1 spot at Manchester City had been taken from him. There is a resigned shrug when he reveals that he has not heard anything whatsoever from Hughes since the deal with Birmingham was arranged. Another came this summer when, having helping England to the final of the European Under-21 Championship, he was suspended for being booked in the semi-final against Sweden, his crime being the \"ungentlemanly conduct\" of trying to put-off his opponents during the penalty shoot-out. It is an experience that still jars. \"That feeling, being in the final but watching from the stand; I have never felt anything like that before. Even now, though, I don't know what I am supposed to have done wrong. Football is supposed to be fun and I was just trying to act in the traditions of Bruce Grobbelaar, I suppose. I was trying to enjoy it and play to the rules, and there's no rule against moving around. We tried to appeal but you can't mess with Fifa.\" Hart, one suspects, has plenty of time to make up for that disappointment, as well as to expunge the memory of those difficult months as Given's understudy at Eastlands. The man Sven-Goran Eriksson describes as \"one of the biggest talents in this country\" may, after all, be needed in Manchester again, even if he is uncertain himself. \"There's no guarantee I will ever play for them again,\" Hart says. \"I would love to but, if I'm not needed, then fair enough. I'm at Birmingham now and I've got nothing to do with Manchester City any more. I still find myself supporting them, their result is the first one I look for and I want the lads to do well, but Birmingham are my priority now. I want to do well for myself, I want to do well for Birmingham and if that means I get another chance with England, that's perfect for everyone.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
