A powerful first half from the hosts all but secured victory against an unusually subdued Blues, whose only salvation was a late Leigh Halfpenny penalty that ensured they claimed a losing bonus point. Given a recently dismal record against Cardiff, this win for Edinburgh will prove especially welcome; they also retain realistic hopes of winning Pool Two. Edinburgh were inspired by the back-row performances of Roddy Grant and the recalled Netani Talei. \"It was a much improved performance from us, from a week ago,\" said Michael Bradley, the Edinburgh coach. \"The boys were up for it. Three wins from four in this competition is not a bad start.\" The possibility of a Gavin Henson debut for Cardiff Blues had heightened interest in the fixture. As it was, the 29-year-old was left in Wales to complete his recovery from a hamstring problem. In reality early talk of a Henson appearance in Edinburgh never seemed much more than a ruse. It seemed much more likely that the Blues' coaches would ease Henson back into competitive action in a match which would, on paper, appear less hazardous than this one. Edinburgh's start highlighted Blues' right to be cautious. Greig Laidlaw kicked the hosts in front after three minutes and Edinburgh extended their advantage with another Laidlaw penalty. Visser , collecting Nick de Luca's smart pass before touching down in the corner. Laidlaw's conversion handed the hosts an enviable 13-0 lead inside 15 minutes. Dan Parks did his bit to haul Blues back into the match with a penalty of his own. In he early stages, though, territory had been dominated by the Scottish side. Given the ease with which Blues had swept the same opponents aside a week earlier, their first half showing in particular here was difficult to comprehend. Perhaps they just did not fancy it on an icy Edinburgh evening. Visser blundered badly when dropping a Laidlaw kick, when the Dutchman should have notched a second Edinburgh try. Instead a Laidlaw drop goal and penalty stretched Edinburgh's advantage to a useful 16 points by the interval. The hosts opened the second period with the same vigour they had displayed in the first. Cardiff's first spell of intense pressure followed. Yet the Edinburgh forwards, combative all evening, repelled all before them. A Halfpenny knock-on brought an end to a promising attacking move and in the end the visitors had Parks's second successful penalty to thank for reducing the deficit to 19-6. Soon afterwards Parks converted a 70th-minute penalty from in front of the posts, then Halfpenny kicked over from long range to keep Blues at least on level terms at the top of Pool Two. But the night had long since belonged to Edinburgh.
