Van Gaal\u2019s side are on a run of six consecutive league victories, the first time the club have managed this since Ferguson\u2019s final season two years ago. However, Van Gaal is a confessed perfectionist and has not always been content with the displays. When it was put to the Dutchman that United have been famous for claiming three points when not always playing well and that he was more concerned about the performance, he said: \u201cI am not only focused on results. That\u2019s the main importance [but] when I speak with Sir Alex he says: \u2018Not any problem, you have won.\u2019 But for me it\u2019s also the performance that\u2019s very important because when you perform you shall win more and that\u2019s what I want to show to the fans and the players want to show that and I think also that the guarantee of wins is much bigger when we perform better. \u201cFor example the game against Hull City was a good game [winning 3-0, in November] and that I have said. We dominated 90 minutes and I want to see more games like that. And now they are too few games that we are dominating 90 minutes and that\u2019s a process.\u201d Van Gaal wants the perfect match from his side. \u201cSo we have to wait and see but of course when you win six times in a row then the confidence is rising,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am still looking for a game that it\u2019s more closer to the perfect game than we have given until now.\u201d For Saturday\u2019s trip to Aston Villa Van Gaal will be without Marouane Fellaini through illness and Marcos Rojo because of a thigh complaint though he also revealed Rafael da Silva had recently been left out of the squad on merit only. \u201cRafael is not injured. Last week he was fit but I have to select [on merit]. Rojo no. We have five injuries and one is ill \u2013 Fellaini \u2013 so they are not coming up.\u201d Van Gaal said \u00c1ngel di Mar\u00eda had trained during the week but that the Argentinian was not match fit. \u201cWhat I have said about Robin van Persie or [Radamel] Falcao, I say it also for Di Mar\u00eda \u2013 there\u2019s no difference,\u201d the manager said in reference to his refusal to bring back players quickly after injuries. \u201cIt\u2019s a procedure and he must follow that procedure. Maybe I shall select him on the bench or maybe not. I have to make my decision because there is one training to go.\u201d Van Gaal became irritated when asked about V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s, the goalkeeper who is training with United. \u201cIt\u2019s only talk from you. Not from us. Not from V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s, not from no one, only the media. I am not here to inform the media. You have to wait and listen and see and that\u2019s it.\u201d Pressed if Liverpool may be interested, Van Gaal said: \u201cOK, then he goes to Liverpool. Yeah, when you see that. But you are suggesting and it\u2019s a big mistake to do that as the media. That\u2019s why I am always angry because you are inventing stories. There are no stories. He is training here. I give him the possibility and then we shall see.\u201d Asked if there was any progress on David de Gea\u2019s new contract, Van Gaal said: \u201cWhat? What? No. No. Otherwise we give that news but first on Manchester United TV. You do understand that? It\u2019s like that. It\u2019s logical.\u201d On whether Van Gaal had seen enough of Falcao to make a decision whether to sign him permanently, the manager said: \u201cHe didn\u2019t play so much then you cannot see too much of a player and he didn\u2019t train so much because he was a lot of time injured so first you have to be fit. \u201cI have said that three weeks or a month ago, the first demand is fitness of a player. And OK, we wait for the fitness of a player. Now he shows fitness on the training sessions so maybe I shall select him, maybe for the bench or the lineup. Wait. And see.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
