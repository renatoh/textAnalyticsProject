There is no such thing as a Muslim priest. Her use of this term is a small example of the solipsism which got us into this mess. Francis Merritt Woking, Surrey \u0095 Muslims have been quick to condemn the comments of Lady Thatcher. I hate to admit it, but she may have a point. For whilst Muslims may argue that Islam is a religion of peace, the Koran exhorts believers to \"Fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them... \" (Surah 9:5). Surely Muslim leaders should give a clear ruling that such verses must not be taken literally. Only then can they rebut comments like Lady Thatcher's. Andy Bannister Pinner, Middx andybannister@mac.com \u0095 Although I condemn the attacks on British Muslims, perhaps if more was said condemning terrorism by the leaders, Muslims would no longer be an easy target. Richard Robinson London \u0095 Tories must stand up and say this is not the way of conservatism. They must say that it is disgraceful. I have not heard enough condemnation from Tory leaders. Sean Louth London \u0095 By employing the US administration's maxim \"for us or against\", Lady Thatcher considers the entire Muslim world to be \"against\" by default. She attempts to vilify the entire Muslim world by demanding that their leaders be more vocal. Richard Stubbings Bristol \u0095 Lady Thatcher seems to enjoy scraping the barrel. Someone should tell her the barrel is empty and it's time to hang up her spoon. Steve Taylor Stratford-upon-Avon, Warks steve@stetay.com \u0095 Over the years there must have been many acts of terrorism which Margaret Thatcher never got round to condemning. Are we to assume she supported them? Brian Moss Tamworth, Staffs \u0095 Not once as a Muslim have I heard Lady Thatcher apologise to the Chileans for the bloodlust of her bosom friend Pinochet. Will she do so now to set an example to the uncivilised Muslims? Nurudin Mehta London"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
