But it does remind me that while I was away for Thanksgiving, my clever and ever-alert niece, who shall remain nameless lest Politicus and other ingrates try to track her down, showed me the following truly hilarious spoof from You Tube, which I hadn't seen and which I recommend in the highest possible terms. It's a parody of an American game show called The $10,000 Pyramid. If you're not familiar, it works like this. There are two teams of two players. Categories appear on a board, and the team picks a category, and the host will reveal to them the meaning of the category by asking them, for example, to \"name these things associated with Christmas.\" And the first thing will be \"Santa Claus,\" and the clue-giver will say to the guesser, \"This is the jolly man in the red suit who delivers presents,\" and so on and so on. It's actually one of the better American game shows of all time. Anyway, without further ado, here it is. Enjoy:"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
