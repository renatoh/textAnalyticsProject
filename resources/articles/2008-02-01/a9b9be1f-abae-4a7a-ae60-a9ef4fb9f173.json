Since the turn of the year Rafael Ben\u00edtez's team have only won once in the Premier League, struggled against lowly opponents Luton and Havant &amp; Waterlooville in cup competition - and today they were knocked out of the FA Cup at Anfield by struggling Championship side Barnsley. For a while the tie was uneventful, Dirk Kuyt ending his 14-game wait for a goal by poking home a first-half opener. But Barnsley only needed 12 minutes of the second period to draw level with a Stephen Foster header. Liverpool laid siege to the Barnsley goal for the last half hour, but they were unable to force a second past inspired keeper Luke Steele - a West Brom loanee - and they eventually paid the price, Brian Howard's 25-yard shot stunning the Kop with seconds remaining to knock the 2006 winners out of the competition. The result will heap pressure on manager Ben\u00edtez; long out of contention in the league, Liverpool's season could effectively be over by Tuesday night, should their home Champions League tie against Serie A leaders Internazionale go with the formbook. Chelsea had no such problems at home against Huddersfield, beating the League One side 3-1, Frank Lampard scoring twice and Salomon Kalou adding another. But Town could at least boast holding the 2005 and 2006 champions at half-time, Michael Collins cancelling out Lampard's first strike just before the break. West Bromwich Albion delivered the result of the day at managerless Coventry City, Tony Mowbray's men thrashing their Midlands rivals at the Ricoh Arena for the second time this season. The Baggies improved on their 4-0 league win by scoring five: already a goal up through Chris Brunt when Michael Doyle was sent off for a late challenge on Zoltan Gera just after half-time, they pulled away with goals from Roman Bednar (two), Ishmael Miller and Gera. In the final 3pm kick off, Cardiff effectively wrapped up their progress against Wolves within the first 11 minutes, Peter Whittingham and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink doing the business. Earlier, Bristol Rovers upset Southampton 1-0 at the Memorial Ground, Rickie Lambert grabbing the only goal of the game with a deflected free-kick six minutes from time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
