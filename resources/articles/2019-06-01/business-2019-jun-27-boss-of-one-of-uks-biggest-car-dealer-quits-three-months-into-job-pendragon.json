Mark Herbert was appointed as chief executive on 1 April and tasked with carrying out a strategic review of the business in an effort to return it to profitability in a tough market. But on Thursday the company, which trades under the Evans Halshaw, Stratstone and Car Store brands, said Herbert will leave \u201cby mutual agreement\u201d on 30 June. \u201cAs a result of the change to the management team, it is envisaged that the strategic update originally scheduled for late September will now be postponed until the appointment of a new chief executive officer is concluded,\u201d Pendragon said in the statement. It is understood that Herbert, the former boss of Jardine Motors Group UK who most recently ran a pan-Asian retailer as part of Jardine Matheson, clashed with Pendragon\u2019s board over strategy. Herbert\u2019s background is in new cars and the franchised market, while the board wants to focus on used cars and online selling through its Car Store website. Until a new chief executive is found, Martin Casha, the longstanding chief operating officer, and Mark Willis, the new chief financial officer who joined from Ten Entertainment in April, will run the business, reporting to Chris Chambers, the chairman. Analysts at Liberum said: \u201cAt the time of appointment, it was clear that the new CEO\u2019s role was not about a wholesale review of the strategy \u2026 We think it unlikely that a CEO from a listed peer would want to make the move, particularly without a mandate to review the whole strategy.\u201d Pendragon declined to say whether Herbert would receive a payoff. He joined without a probation period. The firm\u2019s performance has worsened due to falling prices in the used-car market. Two weeks ago, Pendragon shares crashed after it warned it would be \u201csignificantly loss-making\u201d in the first half and predicted a small pre-tax loss for 2019 as a whole. Analysts had been expecting a profit of almost \u00a335m. Like other dealers, the company, which sells all the main marques, has been forced to slash used-car prices to shift excess stock. It has 177 franchised dealerships and has opened 32 stores that sell only used cars."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
