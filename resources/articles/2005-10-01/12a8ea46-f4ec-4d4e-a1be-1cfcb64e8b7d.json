Scientists have found that this genetic material, nicknamed \"junk\" DNA, maintains the integrity of the more important, coding parts of our genome and is critical for evolutionary survival. Peter Andolfatto, a University of California San Diego biologist, studied the genes of fruit flies and found that the junk DNA was strongly affected by natural selection, which leads to the survival of organisms and genes best adapted to the environment. The sections of DNA which encode for proteins, known as genes, only account for a minority of its genetic material. In a fruit fly, 80% of the DNA seems to have no function; in humans that figure is closer to 95%. This section of DNA is used in creating genetic fingerprints, as random mutations do not cause problems which could predispose people to illness. Professor Andolfatto showed that junk DNA in fruit flies was evolving more slowly than expected, reflecting resistance to the incorporation of new mutations. \"In fact, 40% to 70% of new mutations that arise in non-coding DNA fail to be incorporated by this species, which suggests that these non-protein-coding regions are not junk, but are somehow functionally important to the organism,\" he said. Researchers also found that the junk DNA regions were very different in different species of fruit flies, suggesting an evolutionary importance. Just as mutations in genes change the proteins they code for, changes in the junk DNA could play a role in the creation of new species."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
