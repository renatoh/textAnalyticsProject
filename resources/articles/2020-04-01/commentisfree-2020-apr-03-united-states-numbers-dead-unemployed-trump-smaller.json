If it wasn\u2019t the job market, it was the stock market. You could read it every day in his endless, mindless tweeting or the oh-so-subtle briefings of his campaign aides. November was going to be all about the economy, stupid. Having ripped off so much of Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1980s paraphernalia \u2013 including the slogan he now claims to have invented himself \u2013 Trump was all set to ask the voters the same question that Reagan posed just before his own re-election: are you better off than you were four years ago? For an astonishingly large number of Americans, their answer is a deafeningly loud no. For almost everyone else, the answer is soon to be no. This week\u2019s unemployment numbers have taken the same rocket-ship trajectory as the number of coronavirus cases. Last week it was a record 3.3 million new claims; this week it doubled to another 6.65 million new claims. That\u2019s almost 10 million newly unemployed Americans: more than the previous 10 months combined. Experts already believe that the unemployment rate has jumped from historic lows of 3.5% to numbers we haven\u2019t seen since the Great Depression of around 17%. You don\u2019t need to be an expert to know we have yet to reach peak pain. We can argue about what number represents the greatest suffering in this pandemic: the number of the victims or the unemployed. Each one of the people affected \u2013 by the virus and by the virus-led recession \u2013 is more important to consider than the fate of one man watching cable television in the White House. But we also need to talk about the carnival barker who played a businessman on reality TV for a few years. Because we have never seen someone more ill-suited for leadership at a time of crisis. The history books tell us about Herbert Hoover\u2019s failures to intervene to stop the Great Depression. They tell us about James Buchanan\u2019s support for slavery and his failure to head off the secession of the slave states. Still, Trump stands alone: an incredibly shrinking man who looks and sounds smaller as the numbers of dead and unemployed grow ever larger. Even George W Bush\u2019s epically disastrous war in Iraq pales into insignificance. More Americans have died from this pandemic than in Bush\u2019s war of choice: more than 6,000 dead at the most recent count. Before the revisionists try too hard to make us forget, Trump\u2019s leadership as the virus spread was as loud as a red cap perched on an orange combover. He abolished the pandemic group inside his own national security council, set aside the pandemic playbook left by his predecessor, and proposed cutting the CDC\u2019s funding at the very moment the pandemic was taking hold. He spent February pretending like the pandemic was a hoax or would disappear, and spent March telling governors to fend for themselves. So how did he respond to the worst weekly unemployment claims in American history? By changing the subject to the oil industry, suggesting that the Saudis and Russians might just be cutting production. As he bizarrely tweeted to a shell-shocked nation, \u201cIf it happens, will be GREAT for the oil &amp; gas industry.\u201d Only this sociopath of a president could imagine that what\u2019s good for the oil industry is good for the souls of 10 million newly unemployed Americans. Later in the day, at his so-called press briefing, he said he knew \u201cbetter than anybody\u201d what people were suffering in the restaurant business. His cure is to allow corporations to make their restaurant expenses deductible from their taxes. If only people were going to work and having boozy business lunches, this might just be an idea worth throwing in the trash can. Instead, it\u2019s yet another presidential brain fart. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned so much, so much, that we really have a chance to be bigger and better and stronger,\u201d he concluded, treating the epic disasters of the pandemic and recession as just one more lesson in his on-the-job training course. Sadly Trump\u2019s capacity to learn is far smaller than the economy\u2019s capacity to shed jobs. So we have stimulus cash designed to help people through the worst of the pandemic arriving not this month, or next, or the one after that. Some people won\u2019t receive the help until September, according to internal documents from the Internal Revenue Service. How could we face such a botched preparation for a pandemic and such a botched response to a recession? Look no further than our botcher-in-chief, who decided to write to the Democratic leader in the Senate yesterday as if the only crisis that mattered was the one that threatened his ego. Trump\u2019s spat with Chuck Schumer began, appropriately enough, with the New York senator appearing on cable news. Demonstrating the full scope of his leadership skills, Trump wrote a letter that ran the gamut of his emotions from infantile to childish. \u201cIf you spent less time on your ridiculous impeachment hoax, which went haplessly on forever and ended up going nowhere (except increasing my poll numbers),\u201d he wrote, \u201cand instead focused on helping the people of New York, then New York would not have been so completely unprepared for the \u2018invisible enemy.\u2019\u201d When it comes to haplessly going on forever, Trump may be something of an expert. It makes up for his lack of expertise in preparing for the invisible enemy that everyone but Trump could actually see coming. Now the man who could not prepare for one pandemic disaster is even less prepared for the economic disaster unfolding at the same time. Back in the late stages of the 2008 election, in the middle of the financial collapse, then-candidate Barack Obama was stunned to hear the economists\u2019 projections of 10% unemployment. \u201cWe\u2019ll have riots on the streets if that happens,\u201d one of his closest aides said in disbelief at the time. For his part, Obama joked darkly in private that maybe it would be better to lose the election after all. Unemployment peaked at 10% a full year later. That was the single biggest factor in the Republican (and Tea Party) resurgence in Congress in 2010, effectively ending Obama\u2019s legislative power just two years into his presidency. Today, as unemployment approaches twice that rate, Trump is already trailing Biden in the three battleground states that narrowly won him the presidency four years ago: Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Those states just happen to be where the spike in unemployment claims is among the highest in the country. It won\u2019t be long before Biden\u2019s aides wonder what country they will face next January. November\u2019s election could be just the start of their troubles. \u2022 Richard Wolffe is a Guardian US columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
