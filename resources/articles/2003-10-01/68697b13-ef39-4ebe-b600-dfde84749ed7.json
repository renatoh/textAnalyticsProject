At that moment, gazing at the trophy in the suburbs of Johannesburg, it was hard to believe the future was not pre-ordained. Fast forward to Fremantle this week and Joost van der Westhuizen, the only active survivor of that feted World Cup-winning team, is speaking urgently into a forest of microphones. After 86 Tests he knows better than anyone how warped those Rainbow Nation dreams were to become. Griffiths is long gone and so, too, is any hint of romance in South African rugby. Instead there are a lot of sadder, wiser men who suspect the heady days of 1995 will never be recreated. To look into Van der Westhuizen's eyes, though, is to wonder momentarily if it is not super-confident England who should be concerned. Those eyes are the palest blue and, as someone suggested this week, look as though they belong to a German U-boat captain. There are few in the game with the same glinting determination and when the scrum-half insists England are in for a surprise at Subiaco Oval tomorrow, it would be folly to disregard him. Because, the way Van der Westhuizen tells it, the well-publicised problems that have dogged the Springboks all year have not just strengthened the squad but bonded them almost as close as Kitch Christie's remarkable group eight years ago. Their senior pro, now 32, even reckons the present coach Rudi Straeuli, also a player in '95, has borrowed the late Christie's blueprint. \"A lot of what he does is the same as Kitch: a lot of human skills, a lot of control as well.\" The upshot, he insists, is a side that, as in 1995, adds up to more than the sum of its parts. \"What convinces me is the feeling in my heart, the feeling that I've trained with these guys for the past six months and I know exactly what's going on,\" says Van der Westhuizen quietly, vehemently denying a charge that the Springbok camp is a poisonous mix of entrenched racist attitudes and divisive politics. \"I know there's no - what's the word you use? - prejudice. I know there's nothing like that going on. \"That's why I'm going into this tournament with a song in my heart, alongside guys who know exactly what the truth is. I know the truth, too. We know the only way we can prove people wrong is on the field.\" But surely, after all the racism slurs and woeful results, this is simple window-dressing? Do the rich traditions of the Springbok jersey really mean as much to those who currently don it? Van der Westhuizen's eyes flash once more. \"It still means an awful lot. The only sad part is that the players of the past don't give the team as much support as they would like. I think it would give the young guys so much more to play for, so much pride and passion. As it stands, the only way we can prove them wrong is by winning on the field. We can win six games in a row but they'll still hammer you when you lose one. South Africans only support winning teams.\" After playing for seven Springboks coachs, Van der Westhuizen has seen it all. Under Nick Mallett he says he was forced to follow strict instructions rather than play his natural game but now, despite three major knee operations - he was in the side that beat England in Paris in the last World Cup, despite seriously ruptured knee ligaments - he claims he feels fitter than ever. No Springbok has scored as many Test tries as his 38, although the fact that only three came in the 18 Tests prior to last Sunday's hat-trick off Uruguay suggests his predatory instincts have faded. Yet there is no doubt Van der Westhuizen is a happier man nowadays. He has married again, to Amor, a singer and TV host, and enjoys flying helicopters for fun. In theory he is set to retire from Test rugby at the end of this World Cup but, as yet, is in no rush to confirm it. \"I want to end my career with authority,\" he says, enigmatically. \"The day you finish you must still be proud to be a Springbok.\" Until that day dawns, England should take nothing for granted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
