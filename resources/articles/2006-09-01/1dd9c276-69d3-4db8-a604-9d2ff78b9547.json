The Premier League could also have opted to kill two more major moves from Chelsea, those of William Gallas to Arsenal and Robert Huth to Middlesbrough, on the same grounds. Indeed Huth, who spent most of Thursday night at Middlesbrough's training ground, yesterday admitted to feeling \"almost suicidal\" with worry that he would not be allowed to remain with Gareth Southgate's team. However the Premier League - which also allowed Arsenal to sign the 18-year-old Brazilian midfielder Denilson from Sao Paulo after midnight - opted to take a lenient approach and rule that the contracts had been finalised in spirit, if not in law, before the deadline. Yesterday the FA said in a statement: \"The FA Premier League can accept that the registrations of Robert Huth, William Gallas, Denilson and Ashley Cole have been accepted. \"Whilst not all the documentation was received prior to the midnight deadline the FA Premier League is satisfied the deals were completed in time and the delay in the paperwork being received was due to circumstances outside the control of the clubs.\" Arsenal and Chelsea seemingly pleaded mitigating circumstances, arguing that their deals were slowed by the FA's initial reluctance to release Ashley Cole from England duty to talk to Chelsea and undergo a medical, and the difficulty of getting the blood tests from that medical analysed late in the evening. The Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, whose visit to a European coaching seminar in Geneva was disrupted as talks over the deal dragged on, admitted his relief that the two clubs managed to beat the clock. \"It dragged on for a long time,\" he said. \"The positive thing is that it's finally over. It was the wish of Ashley Cole to go to Chelsea and the wish of William Gallas to come to us, so I'm relieved it has happened.\" Meanwhile Huth's transfer was delayed because, although Boro had completed all their paperwork and even lodged the first installment of his \u00a36m fee by 2pm on Thursday, the Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon failed to sign a couple of documents which had to be faxed to the Premier League before the deal could be ratified. Kenyon seemingly did not get round to signing these papers until after Cole's arrival had been secured, forcing his Middlesbrough counterpart Keith Lamb to wait for confirmation of the deal until around 1am. Bar a brief excursion for a meal at a local pub, Huth, Lamb and Southgate spent the evening at the club's training centre near Darlington, willing the fax machine to start whirring. As the clock ticked, Lamb engaged in some increasingly heated telephone conversations with Chelsea in between games of table tennis with Huth. \"Thursday was a very tense day,\" said Huth. \"When it got to 9pm and then 10pm you started wondering, 'Is it going to happen?' I was almost suicidal.\" Lamb was rather more sanguine. \"It went pretty close to the wire but I was confident it would happen,\" he said. \"Peter Kenyon had given me his word and Peter is a man of his word.\" Huth could also have joined Newcastle United, but had his heart set on playing for Southgate. Mark Viduka also chose Boro over the Magpies - the Australian discussed the mooted move with his agent while sitting in his car at Middlesbrough's training ground before, much to Southgate's relief, the proposed deal was rejected. Wenger's other major piece of business, the exchange of Jose Antonio Reyes, who joined Real Madrid on a season's loan, for the Brazilian Julio Baptista, was more straightforward, and the Frenchman is confident that Arsenal have done well from the deal. \"We'll see how the swap works but I'm confident it will work well because Baptista is quick, strong and a team player,\" he said. But Atl\u00e9tico Madrid said yesterday that Reyes had signed a pre-contract agreement with them. \"It included a \u20ac2m (\u00a31.34m) penalty clause if the player did not play for Atl\u00e9tico this season,\" said their sporting director Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda Pitarch. \"Our legal services will intervene to claim this money on behalf of the club.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
