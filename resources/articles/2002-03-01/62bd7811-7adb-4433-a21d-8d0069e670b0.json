The ramifications for early musicology and theology - not to mention the entire march of feminism - are immense, if it turns out that the visionary works of the definitive medieval superwoman were essentially the product of a terrible headache. The Hildegard problem is significant because it crops up in these two novels from across the Atlantic, both dealing with the doubtful visions of sisters of the faith. Mark Salzman's spare novella, Lying Awake , analyses the weird anachronism of a community of Carmelites walled up in the middle of modern Los Angeles. Louise Erdrich's chunkier Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse is a spiritual western spread out on a panoramic, Willa Cather scale. With great tact and guile, Salzman pieces together the spiritual crisis of a contemporary Carmelite, Sister John of the Cross, whose best-selling book of religious visions may in fact be the product of a hypergraphia (or voluminous writing) associated with temporal lobe epilepsy. This epiphany-inducing epilepsy has been characterised for centuries as \"holy madness\". Dostoevsky was a sufferer, and wrote of moments of unbearable lucidity during which he \"felt the presence of the eternal harmony. Five seconds during which I live a whole human existence, and for that I would give my whole life and not think that I was paying too dearly\". Salzman's book satisfies all sorts of random curiosities about the practicalities of living in a closed, silent order - such as how they communicate without talking and who does their shopping. But its real strength lies in the presentation of the surreal contrast between a holy community and the manic pace of the modern American metropolis. Sister John's initial drive to the hospital is almost more disorienting than the headaches themselves. As she experiences for the first time the surging momentum of the freeway beneath a plane-congested sky, she feels as if the whole of Los Angeles were \"trying to escape a burning building through a pinhole\". The comedy of a nun adrift in a conurbation is often exquisite. Observing the strange catalogue of reactions that people reserve for nuns, Sister John reflects that the traditional habit and wimple was originally calculated to preserve anonymity, being the outfit generally adopted by poor medieval widows. A truly effective habit today would be a luminous shell-suit and sneakers. The central figure of Louise Erdrich's Last Report on the Miracles also negotiates life in a strange form of liturgical fancy dress, but the priestly vestments and tight chest bandage are designed to conceal the fact that Little No Horse's venerable preacher is actually a woman. The story of how Agnes de Witt becomes Sister Cecilia, and subsequently transmutes into Father Damien Modeste, occupies the initial - and by far the most riveting - chunk of Erdrich's saga. Like a great midwestern river, it flows slowly and magisterially across vast distances, with an occasional tendency to silt up in places. The source of Sister Cecilia's ecstasy is not epilepsy but Chopin. When she plays the piano, \"it was as though her soul were neatly removed with a drinking straw and siphoned into the green pool of quiet that lay behind the rippling cascade of notes\". Eventually Cecilia's orgasmic Chopin becomes so sensuous that the Mother Superior feels obliged to confiscate the music and impose a strict regime of Bach exercises until she simmers down. Eventually a flash flood takes Cecilia to the familiar terrain of Erdrich's previous six novels: the Native American reservation of the Ojibwe, where the author was raised. Erdrich's North Dakota has the same mythological imprint as E Annie Proulx's Newfoundland. She writes about an obscure parcel of land and its endangered way of life with true, empathetic poetry, spiced with offbeat flashes of humour. Particularly enjoyable is Damien/ Cecilia's checklist of apt masculine mannerisms, including self-exhortations to \"Stride, swing arms, stop abruptly, stroke chin\" and \"Admire women's handiwork with copious amazement\". Less easy to accommodate is the sedate, midwestern lethargy into which the narrative sinks after its whirlwind beginning. Erdrich's poetic style tends to unwind over long paragraphs rather than become focused into sharply pointed epithets, and Father Damien's story is clouded rather than clarified by long digressions into the folkloric history of his parishioners. Erdrich's increasing band of admirers will need no encouragement to steep themselves in her oblique, Ojibwe world, however. Best enjoyed on a veranda with something strong and distilled."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
