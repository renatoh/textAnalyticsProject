Moores, the current director of the National Academy, will take up the position on May 1, 16 days before the start of the first Test against West Indies at Lord's, as England seek to draw a line under one of their most disastrous winters in recent years. Moores, who confirmed his reputation as one of England's brightest young coaches when he led Sussex to their first County Championship title in 2003, had widely been expected to take over in the short term after Thursday's announcement that Fletcher was quitting after 7\u00bd years in the job. What was less clear was that he would immediately be named as Fletcher's long-term successor too, especially as Dav Whatmore, who has announced his decision to step down as coach of Bangladesh, was believed to be in the running. Instead, the 44-year-old Moores will get his chance to demonstrate that the skills which helped turn Sussex from a perennial bunch of underachievers into the best team in county cricket will also apply to the international arena. An ECB spokesman said yesterday that Moores was not merely the board's first choice but \"the only choice\", although he declined to reveal any details of his contract. \"It's an honour to have been appointed as England head coach and to succeed Duncan Fletcher, who has been an outstanding coach of the England team,\" said Moores. \"The challenge of this new role excites me and I look forward to meeting up with the players on their return to the United Kingdom and to leading England to success in both Test and one-day cricket.\" The England captain, Michael Vaughan, said yesterday that it was \"the right time\" for Fletcher to leave. \"All good things have to come to an end and I think he's made the right decision at the right time,\" he said. \"I'm hugely behind Peter Moores's appointment because I think he'll do a good job. The happenings of the last few months and where the team have been at on the playing field have been an area of concern and Duncan has made the right decision to move on. \"I think the players have got to hold their hands up and just say we haven't performed well enough as a team. Duncan's coaching hasn't changed much over the last year but the players haven't responded and played as well as they can - we're disappointed as players because we feel we've let him down in some way. \"It has been an emotional period when you lose a great coach. He sat down with me the other night and told me he would be resigning. It was a sad moment because I know how much he's influenced my career. More importantly I know how much he's influenced English cricket. I said to him that no matter what happens on Saturday that he can walk away back to his house in Cape Town, have a few beers, have a round of golf and be very proud.\" The ECB was always keen to promote from within. Moores spent eight years in charge at Hove before replacing Rod Marsh as academy director in 2005, a position to which Fletcher played a central role in appointing him, as a member of the four-member panel that interviewed him for the job. Moores has also led the England A team on tour as part of the ECB's elite coaching programme. The decision to apoint him as Fletcher's successor will be well received on the county circuit. Whereas Fletcher was regarded as aloof, Moores's 20-year involvement with Sussex, first as a pugnacious wicketkeeper/batsman, then as coach, means he is unlikely to lose touch in the same way. Concerns about his lack of international experience are almost certain to crop up in the weeks and months ahead, but no one doubts his enthusiasm and natural man-management skills."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
