When Konta, seeded 20th, goes on to court in the first round against the German Julia G\u00f6rges \u2013 on either Monday or Tuesday \u2013 she will take with her not only one of the most reliable all-round games but a steel-trap mind that allows not a flicker of distraction. Although she has had a remarkable rise through the rankings over the past 12 months, the British No1 refuses to be lured into either complacency or overconfidence. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily feel like the hunter or the hunted,\u201d she said after the draw on Friday. \u201cI think it\u2019s an even playing field. I will go out there and I\u2019ll compete the best I can and we\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d Yet only last December, before she resumed her exciting journey, she told a group of us at the National Tennis Centre in Roehampton: \u201cIt\u2019s exciting because of more players knowing more of who I am. It\u2019s more me being the hunted rather than the hunter. However I have no fear of that. I look forward to the challenge because my goals are all very much processed and my own.\u201d That is the power of the \u201cprocess\u201d. It allows this ever-improving player to exist in a bubble, where she feels most comfortable. If it works \u2013 and it has so far \u2013 she could well roar through her side of the draw as far as the semi-finals, where Serena Williams would probably be waiting. Not that Konta would know that, she admits. \u201cI like to know just who I play [first]. It doesn\u2019t matter, because nothing\u2019s for certain. I may get to that point, I may not. The same with her, she may not, so ...\u201d But she does know where she is in the locker room: No11, somewhere between Victoria Azarenka and Petra Kvitova. \u201cI chose locker 11 because that was my highest junior ranking, so I thought I\u2019d be sentimental.\u201d So, did she feel she belonged at last, after years of, well, hunting? \u201cI don\u2019t really try to belong anywhere. I\u2019m a part of the women\u2019s tour and there are a lot of us. In the same way, it\u2019s quite a small world, so I just try to do my best in this discipline.\u201d While she tries to strip every verbal exchange of elements that might intrude on her \u201cprocess\u201d, Konta\u2019s natural warmth is palpable. And her game is in great shape. Heather Watson is also a cheery presence, although her task looks tougher: against her new doubles partner, the American Nicole Gibbs. \u201cShe\u2019s more of a counter-puncher,\u201d Watson said. \u201cShe\u2019s a good mover. She\u2019s not going to blow me away with big shots. But it should be interesting.\u201d Her priority, though, remains the Olympics. A win over Gibbs would pretty much guarantee her a place, and she couldn\u2019t be more excited. \u201cIt\u2019s everything that comes with it,\u201d she said, \u201cmeeting the other British athletes, the foreign athletes, the village, being part of the biggest sporting event in the world, competing for your country, getting lots of cool kit, trading badges, meeting new people. It\u2019s getting so close, it\u2019s stressful. I still feel I need to win at least one round here, definitely. It is a big motivation for me. I\u2019m not sleeping that great but I think that is because of my hay fever. I\u2019m getting an itchy throat and a blocked nose. And my curtains aren\u2019t that great, and it\u2019s so bright in the morning\u201d It could be curtains for Laura Robson in the first round on Sunday if she does not quickly get on top of the 28th seed, Andrea Petkovic, but she is in relaxed mood as her comeback gathers pace. The former British No1 says her injured wrists no longer give her pain, and she is desperate to start winning again. Naomi Broady, meanwhile, has played some excellent tennis this year, and she will need to produce plenty of it to get past the American, Coco Vandeweghe on Monday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
