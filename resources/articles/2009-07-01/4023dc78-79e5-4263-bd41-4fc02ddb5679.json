Without confirming the old saw that it's better to travel than to arrive, it had been quite a journey. The four of us had met an hour earlier in despair of ever finding what had once seemed an unchallenging, if novel, restaurant address. The problem with locating \"10th Floor, Peckham Multistorey Car Park\", however, is that no sign hints at the building's name, while the lift stops at the 6th floor. I knew this, having bemusedly left the car park an hour earlier for an aimless drive around what would have been Del Boy Trotter's manor if they hadn't taken fright and filmed in locations as far from Peckham as Bristol and Brighton. My friends also knew it, having done much the same. Eventually, we linked up in a nearby Morrisons car park and returned on foot, taking as distinctly fragranced a lift as you will ever encounter back to the sixth floor. Eager to prove that I had indeed been there before, but had forgotten to plant the flag, I showed them the vast object deposited behind a door to nowhere, seemingly produced from the rear of a tiger. \"This is lovely,\" muttered a veteran of unhappy outings. \"I thought that Manchester place was\u2026\" His voice dribbled away in a rivulet of melancholy. We wandered around for half an hour, descending to ground level in bemusement before reascending for one last crack. Then it happened. One of us chanced upon a ramp, and another, up to a car-less space dotted with art installations, and then a final ramp to the roof. And there in the distance, beyond metallic abstracts, stood a red tarpaulin-covered wooden structure, designed by Antony Gormley's daughter Paloma and vaguely redolent of a primitive boat. Arms were raised in triumph as we approached, and mentioned to a sweet young, possibly trustafarian chap that the odyssey had given us an appetite. \"Ah,\" he said, \"we haven't got much actual food. It's lunchtime, you see\u2026\" But your website\u2026 \"Yeah, but we were busy last night. And it's expensive to fire up the grill.\" We glanced sardonically at the bags of charcoal sat in a supermarket trolley by the bar. \"We can do you cold vegetables with anchovy sauce. And there's really nice cake.\" We slumped at a table garlanded with overflowing ashtrays, and the young chap brought over Camparis. \"Look,\" he said, possibly connecting us to the photographer's visit the previous day, \"I've decided to fire up the grill after all.\" The meal that ensued was in effect a picnic, albeit one from the surrealist imaginings of an earlier Paloma-siring artist. As crab on toast, gazpacho and cold grilled lamb arrived, so did the rain, cunningly slanted to evade the tarpaulin. \"It's damp, it's cold,\" one of my friends said to me with his head on the table, \"and I fucking hate you.\" Ox heart salad, coppa and salami, red and green tomatoes, and grilled aubergines and courgettes with that anchovy sauce made their way, and like everything else wouldn't have been out of place at the bar of St John. \"Sorry not to be more creative,\" was the critique, \"but apart from 'perfectly nice', I can't think of a thing to say. Except \u2013 did I mention this? \u2013 that I hate you.\" \"Come on,\" I consoled, \"look at that view of the Gherkin and the London Eye. Imagine being 19 and into bad art, LSD and urban deprivation tourism. It's paradise!\" A young woman, just as posh and chirpy as the young chap, brought over a date-laden cake that was indeed really nice and coffee, and asked if were familiar with Paloma's work. \"We are now,\" said one of us. \"She builds sheds. Or begins to.\" We left, losing our way once or twice before a familiar scent (and to think Theseus escaped the labyrinth without a tiger turd to guide his path) confirmed we were on the right track. Back outside Morrisons, we bade each other farewell. \"Don't forget it's a 'pop-up' and only there until the end of September,\" I told the grumpiest. \"When you go back, and I know you will, who do you want to take?\" \"Himmler,\" he said, and in a blur was gone. frankscafe.org.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
