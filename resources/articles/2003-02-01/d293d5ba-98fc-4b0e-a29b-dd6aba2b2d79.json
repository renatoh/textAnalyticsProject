Robson had said he did not want anything fancy, just the points, but his young team - average age only 23 - wrapped them up in a black and white ribbon. In the stadium where Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United all failed to win last season, the replacement strikeforce of Shola Ameobi and Lomana LuaLua scored three times in the first 32 minutes. Though Franca pulled one back for Leverkusen and the home side rallied after the break, Newcastle and Robson could content themselves with a display that was both adventurous and mature. Leverkusen are a team reduced in stature from last season of course, and sacked Klaus Toppm\u00f6ller at the weekend, but they still had to be beaten. Newcastle earned their first points of the group in doing so and will be keen to grab another three against the same opponents at St James' Park next Wednesday when Alan Shearer will be back to lead the line. Normally the absence of a partnership as effective as Alan Shearer and Craig Bellamy would have overshadowed the game. Newcastle's suspension problems, however, paled into insignificance when compared to the disarray of their hosts. The last time Leverkusen won a match was on December 7. In the seven games since they have slumped to the verge of the Bundesliga's relegation zone before sacking Toppm\u00f6ller on Sunday following the defeat by Hansa Rostock. The temporary manager Thomas H\u00f6rster was clearly unimpressed by that performance, making eight changes from Saturday's starting line-up. Leverkusen, finalists in Glasgow nine months ago, fielded only four of the side that ran Real Madrid so close. This meant the Germans began last night with a back four who had mustered just 16 appearances between them. The men replacing Shearer and Bellamy, Ameobi and LuaLua, had eight more than that even though they are nearly always second choice. Both ran with far greater confidence than any of their markers from the first whistle. Even before Ameobi stooped to nod in the first after five minutes, Newcastle had imposed themselves. When LuaLua gained possession on the Leverkusen left, he was able to drift by Pascal Ojigwe and the Brazilian Cris with embarrassing ease. LuaLua is often wasteful but on this occasion he found Ameobi unmarked two yards out, whose headed finish was a formality. Not so Ameobi's second, though again he was hardly tested by efficient German defending with Cris foresaking possession all too easily under challenge. The 21-year-old striker then chested the ball down and ghosted around Thomas Kleine, before drilling the ball low left-footed past Jorg Butt from 20 yards out. At this stage Leverkusen were painful to watch and Newcastle's fans were singing Happy Birthday to Robson. But Newcastle can generally be relied upon to make a game of even unpromising situations. Sure enough in the 26th minute the black and white stripes were split apart. Yildiray Basturk and Jan Simak combined to feed Franca. The expensive Brazilian has been considered one of Toppm\u00f6ller's failures but he clipped the ball over Shay Given coolly. The BayArena took some heart at that and yet seven minutes later the home side again self-destructed. Keeping the ball in play, Oliver Neuville succeeded merely in presenting it to Olivier Bernard. His pass found Laurent Robert whose excellent first-time cross was volleyed in superbly on the run by LuaLua. With Bernd Schneider on for the second half Leverkusen instantly looked a more urgent outfit. For the first time in the match really, the play was in Newcastle territory and Thomas Brdaric had a 51st minute header disallowed. Five minutes later after Simak had caused a spot of panic in the Newcastle area, Brdaric missed a sitter from eight yards with only Given to beat, and as home momentum gathered Aaron Hughes had to clear from virtually underneath his own crossbar as Brdaric waited again. The Leverkusen players were showing for the ball now in a way they had not been in the first half. Only a great run by the perpetual Dyer punctuated Leverkusen's growing authority and Robson was an increasingly agitated presence as he patrolled the touchline barking out instructions. Bayer Leverkusen (4-1-4-1): Butt; Preuss (Schneider h-t), Kleine, Cris (Brascher, 71), Ojigwe; Balitsch; Neuville, Simak, Basturk, Brdaric; Franca. Newcastle United (4-4-2): Given; Hughes, O'Brien, Bramble, Bernard; Jenas, Dyer, Speed, Robert; Ameobi, LuaLua (Chopra, 82).
