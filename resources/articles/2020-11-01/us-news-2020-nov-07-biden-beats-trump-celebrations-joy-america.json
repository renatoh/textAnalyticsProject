In Philadelphia, the biggest city in Pennsylvania, the state where Biden was born and which sealed his electoral college victory, celebrations erupted outside the convention center where votes were being counted. Donna Widmann, a teacher who helped get her students and their families registered to vote, told the Guardian she had not been able to stop crying. \u201cI remember four years ago, watching, you know, on 21 January 2017, him getting inaugurated,\u201d she said, referring to Trump\u2019s installation as the 45th president after his shock victory over Hillary Clinton. \u201cAnd just crying \u2026 just watching [Barack] Obama leave and just crying. I feel like so much, so much emotion has happened in the past four years, man, and it just feels really good \u2013 like I can\u2019t stop crying.\u201d Windmann, who was holding a sign saying Trump should \u201ctake the L\u201d, said she was \u201cpsyched\u201d for her students and her families to know they made a difference. Alice Sukhina, who is from Ukraine, said she had volunteered for the Biden campaign. She had not been able to see her family in four years, she said, adding that she had sent them messages saying that the wait would soon be over. \u201cI am overwhelmed with happiness,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just so ready to get some real progressive things done. I\u2019m ready to push the platform of Democrats to the left.\u201d Marissa Babnew said she was \u201cutterly excited for the first time in a very long time\u201d and added: \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of close experiences with this pandemic because of my work, and I\u2019m finally feeling hopeful.\u201d In Manhattan, where Trump made his fortune in real estate but where he remains a highly controversial and deeply divisive figure, crowds flocked to public spaces including Washington Square Park. Uptown, in Washington Heights, two friends, both actors, celebrated in Bennett Park, the sight of a key battle in the American revolutionary war. \u201cOur long national nightmare is over,\u201d said Paul DeBoy, happily quoting Gerald Ford\u2019s famous message to the nation after the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974. Ward Duffy said the cheering out of apartment block windows, banging of pots and pans, and cars honking in the streets represented \u201ca different celebration than this summer\u2019s respectful salutes to frontline workers\u201d during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThis had a visceral explosion of relief and joy,\u201d he said. Cheering, honking and banging of pots and pans erupted in Harlem too. Chase Rivera was pedaling a free Citi Bike at top speed past 152nd Street, dinging its bell and whooping loudly, wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt. He skidded to a halt when the Guardian flagged him down and, sweating in the late fall sunshine, said: \u201cWe were on our way to a dictatorship. This is the happiest I\u2019ve seen people in 2020.\u201d The native New Yorker, 25, said he was a laboratory scientist and looked forward to a president who once again respected science. \u201cLet\u2019s hear it for science,\u201d he said. \u201cBiden and Harris have already spoken on the coronavirus, and we need to get to grips with it. Then I\u2019m very excited for the Green New Deal, and that we will be part of the Paris climate accord again and take action on the climate crisis.\u201d Alan Mingo, a Broadway and film actor who has lived in the Sugar Hill part of Harlem for 17 years, had tears in his eyes as he roamed the streets, texting with friends. \u201cSeeing this euphoria, this jubilation, it\u2019s incredible,\u201d he said. He said he had been shaken out of half-sleep by the eruption on the streets when the race was called, and had passed people exclaiming how their vote had mattered. As a Black gay man, he said, he saw Trump as having inflicted pain \u201con Black and brown people, not just with his rhetoric, but when he started separating children [from their parents at the US-Mexico border] that had echoes of so many bad things from our history\u201d. He added that he was very proud that Kamala Harris would become vice-president, the first woman of colour elected to the role. On the west coast, cheers and the banging of pots and pans rang out through streets just blocks away from the hospital where the vice-president-elect was born. It was about 8.30am PT when the Associated Press made the call that Biden had secured the final electoral votes to win the presidency. Oakland awoke to cheers and honking cars. Harris was born in Oakland in 1964 and grew up in neighboring Berkeley."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
