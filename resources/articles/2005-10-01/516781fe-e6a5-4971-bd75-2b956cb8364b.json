It's an old question, raised again with the news that the parents and spouses of those killed by the July 7 bombs in London have started to receive compensation for their loss. It's an unanswerable question which requires an answer. There is one glib response - \u00a311,000. That is the basic sum the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority pays out for every life lost on that awful day. But that's if there is only one claimant. If more than one - parents, spouses, long-term partners, children are all eligible - they each get just \u00a35,500 grief money. The authority has no power to give more. The law has laid down the maximum. I should make it clear that we are not talking about cases where the claimants have suffered financially because of the death - that is a different kind of claim. The issue here is compensation for the bereavement, the grief, the pain caused by losing a child, wife or husband. Understandably, many in that situation regard a maximum of \u00a311,000 as an insult: \"Is that all a life is worth?\" they ask. No, of course not. No one - certainly not the government or the compensation authority - is foolish enough to argue that the payment is meant to represent the valuation of a lost life. But there is something troublingly illogical about the demand for more. Parents say: \"No amount of money can ever compensate me for the death of my child.\" That is heartbreakingly true. Then: \"But what they're offering is far too little.\" So if \u00a311,000 is inadequate, how much would be acceptable? How do we calculate the amount? Should it be means-tested? Should it depend on how many other children the parents have or, in the case of a spouse claiming compensation, how long the marriage has lasted? Or should we return to the first part of the parents' cry, and decide that if no amount of money can compensate for their grief, then it serves no purpose to pay them anything? The money saved could then go instead to survivors of the atrocities, who may need help for the rest of their lives. We could delve even deeper and ask, philosophically and logically, why a mother and father whose child has died of some dreadful disease should miss out on compensation for their grief, while children dying as a result of a crime trigger off payments to their parents. Is either grief the greater? There is no satisfactory answer to these dilemmas. There is, and cannot be, a correct figure to compensate for grief; \u00a311,000 is a token, a gesture, a mark of sympathy. The tough alternative is to decide that grief is random, and not capable of division into those worthy of being paid for it, while others are left in the financial cold. As a born Frenchman, I'm not enjoying London's constant gloating about its cultural superiority over Paris, especially as most of its claims are true. There's no doubt that art (of every kind), music and theatre are more vibrant and exciting here than there. Only in film-making does France beat England. On Monday, the French prime minister, Dominique de Villepin, announced his plans to restore French artists to the pre-eminence they once held, or at least to lift them out of the despondency into which they have sunk. Among other initiatives, there is to be a huge new centre for contemporary creation and hefty tax benefits for young artists. I'm sure they will be of help, if only to prevent promising artists from giving up and becoming civil servants. But art does not always thrive because money has been spent. Superior art and artists tend to emerge from a society which, at a particular time and for a complexity of reasons, is ready and willing to nurture talent and discover genius. Cities and countries go through moods and phases which can be friendly or hostile to innovative art. Paris buzzed artistically for longer than any other city in the world. It isn't buzzing now; nor is France. I am pleased that the French government values art strongly enough to create those important initiatives (at a time when the British government is going in the opposite direction), but it will not make a lot of difference. Until France regains its health and joie de vivre, its art will be in no state to try to regain its status and reputation. And London will continue to gloat. I have this in common with General de Gaulle. We have both travelled in a Citroen DS, for some distance, on fewer than four wheels. The circumstances, admittedly, were a little different. He was at the time escaping an assassination attempt by OAS (anti-Algerian independence) terrorists. One - some say two - of his tyres had been blown by the putative killer and it was only the car's ability to function on the ones remaining that enabled it to pull away out of danger. In my case, I was trying to drive to an orange emergency phone on the M1 after a somewhat mundane puncture. Still, that sort of shared experience creates a bond. The DS - the best car ever devised and designed - had its 50th birthday celebration on Sunday and I was not there to join the 1,500 of them that processed through Paris. Mine was a 1965 model with seats that still smelled of leather, a sleek dashboard that resembled a jukebox and that crazy, romantic hydraulic system that whooshed the car up and whispered it down. So low was it when parked that no clamp could be affixed to it. Alas, its very sophistication rendered it delicate, prone to tantrums and expensive to run and repair. My moment of truth came in France, when, about 10 years ago, a gaggle of French mechanics stood looking at it in awe and wonderment, none of them with the faintest idea how to fix it. The last DS had been manufactured in 1975 and in one generation it had passed from being the most exciting and modern car on earth to an amusing relic of a bygone age. But I will never again be as happy behind a wheel. This week Marcel looked at The Tree of Life, a sculpture at the British Museum: \"Rather moving and hopeful because it's made entirely out of guns and other weapons handed in after the Mozambique civil war.\" Marcel saw Panorama, on anti-terrorism laws, \"nearly ruined by absurd, faked up and badly acted conversations between Tony and Cherie Blair\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
