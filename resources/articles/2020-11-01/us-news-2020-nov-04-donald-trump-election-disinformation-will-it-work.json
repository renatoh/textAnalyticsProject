Disinformation experts weigh in", "bodyText": "Misinformation loves a vacuum, and the uncertainty around the outcome of the US presidential race has created a mighty one. As election officials work to count ballots, Donald Trump and his allies have launched a campaign to cast doubt on the electoral process. False declarations of victory and false allegations of fraud are being pumped into the information void, where their salacious narratives compete with the more prosaic reality that counting takes time. We spoke with experts on disinformation about why people believe the false narratives Trump is pushing, what those people might do in response, and why Trump\u2019s latest conspiracy theory might not catch on the way he hopes. The big lie For months, Trump has seeded doubt about the legitimacy of mail-in ballots, laying the groundwork for the vague conspiracy theories about fraudulent ballots that he tweeted wildly about throughout the day on Wednesday. Trump\u2019s claims are perfectly suited to people who share what Whitney Phillips, a professor of communications at Syracuse University, calls \u201cdeep memetic frames\u201d or \u201cdeeply, viscerally held stories about the world that shape what you think to be true and what you think should be done in response\u201d. One such frame is characterized by deep distrust of institutions and \u201ca general sense that there are people who are out to get people who look like us\u201d \u2013 such as the so-called \u201cdeep state\u201d. This mindset has been prevalent in recent months amid the rise of QAnon and Covid-skeptic communities, Phillips said. \u201cIn some ways, the sensationalist child-eating, blood-drinking QAnon stuff distracts from the really corrosive part of the narrative, which is the idea that liberals, scientists and Jews are all coming to get you, so you better go get your guns.\u201d Phillips views Trump\u2019s failure to debunk or denounce conspiracy theories as preparations for selling this latest conspiracy theory. \u201cIn the past few months, Trump started using the deep state by name; he started specifically engaging with and embracing QAnon,\u201d she said. \u201cThat underlying frame \u2013 \u2018don\u2019t trust \u201cthem\u201d\u2019 \u2013 was the groundwork for his efforts to contest the election.\u201d Notably, this disinformation effort remains a top-down approach. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about misinformation from the grassroots or foreign actors, said Alex Stamos, director of the Stanford Internet Observatory, at a Wednesday morning election debrief. \u201cIt\u2019s known influencers.\u201d Online to offline Among people who believe Trump\u2019s false claims about election theft, there is likely to be a strong impetus to take action. \u201cAnytime people feel that their rights are being taken from them, especially by the government, we do see widespread social unrest,\u201d said Joan Donovan, research director at Harvard\u2019s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. Already, protesters have targeted the TFC Center in Detroit, demanding access to the office where ballots are being counted. And worryingly, the American right does not have the same tradition of street protest that the political left does. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a robust repertoire of tactics as you\u2019re heading into a street protest, then it becomes very appealing to use violence as the messenger,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cIt does tend to enliven the spirit of paramilitary organizations and people who are supporters of the second amendment, who believe that a Democratic president would be coming for their guns. We\u2019re going to see a lot of those issues coalesce in the next few days.\u201d The role of the platforms Under intense pressure from the traditional news media, researchers and civil society, the social media platforms that long allowed Trump tremendous leeway to break their polices have taken a more aggressive stance toward his false claims about the election. In the run-up to the election, Twitter and Facebook began applying misinformation labels to some of Trump\u2019s false statements, and Facebook even expanded its policy on premature declaration of victory on Wednesday \u2013 an uncommonly quick response from a company that tends to dig in its heels when facing criticism from the press. The labels are by no means a panacea. \u201cFor people behind a certain frame, a label on a tweet is just more evidence that there\u2019s censorship,\u201d said Phillips. Stamos also noted that the lack of lasting punishments (like suspensions or bans) for repeat offenders has created a reverse incentive for certain influencers. \u201cThey seem to enjoy being punished,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of their brand now.\u201d Losing the megaphone While Trump is certainly pushing the false idea of a stolen election, and while some of his supporters are deeply susceptible to believing that narrative, it\u2019s still unclear if the narrative will take hold more broadly. \u201cIn order to do disinformation well, you have to have a few key elements,\u201d said Donovan. \u201cOne is an online cavalry ready to troll. The second is either key figures or key evidence that allow you to make your claim. The third thing is the claim has to be very straightforward and people have to have something to circulate.\u201d While various videos and photos have emerged as supposed \u201cproof\u201d of fraud, they have all been debunked by factcheckers and none appear ready for prime time \u2013 the fourth element of a successful disinformation campaign. \u201cTo really break out, you need the megaphone of conservative media,\u201d Donovan said. On election night, Fox News declined to validate Trump\u2019s conspiracy theory and instead hewed generally to evidence-based projections. \u201cThe Maga coalition that brought Trump\u2019s presidency into being has been fractured,\u201d Donovan added. \u201cThe tale of the tape is going to be if Fox News calls it for Biden ahead of other outlets or in line with other major news outlets. If they are not on board with Trump\u2019s challenges ideologically and in terms of evidence, then Trump is going to have a really big uphill battle in terms of controlling the narrative of who won.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
