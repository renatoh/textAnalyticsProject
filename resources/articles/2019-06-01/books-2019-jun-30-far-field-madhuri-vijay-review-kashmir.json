Shalini, a 30-year-old from a well-to-do family in Bangalore, is drifting from job to job, increasingly bankrolled by her emotionally distant and physically absent father. She finds herself daydreaming about her childhood, in particular a memory of her mother\u2019s flirtation with a clothes salesman, Bashir. Was he, Shalini wonders, her mother\u2019s only real friend? Certainly, he seemed to be the only person who really understood her mother, her restlessness, her sarcasm, her combativeness. Shalini decides to track him down, following a half-remembered clue that leads her to a mountain village in Kashmir. Boarding with a kind family amid the political tension and remnants of conflict, she discovers the importance of kinship and community. But her background of wealth and privilege is of little use to her here. She misunderstands the threat of soldiers. She struggles to reconcile the push and pull between living \u201can ordinary life\u201d and the realities of violence. However, with each new experience, Shalini feels the pull of a true calling. Maybe, she thinks, she can give something to these people and their lives. Her efforts prove catastrophic, however, and the novel becomes a powerful meditation on the chaos of good intentions \u2013 how well-meaning philanthropy can be undone by the naivety of privilege. Shalini is reminded that she is an outsider. At one point, she realises: \u201cFor people like me, safe and protected, even the greatest risk is, ultimately, an indulgence.\u201d It\u2019s the classic do-gooder syndrome \u2013 being a saviour doesn\u2019t mean you get what\u2019s going on. There are quiet moments of reflection as the present and past start to mirror each other, secrets are revealed and memories are interrogated until they take on new meaning. Shalini\u2019s quest \u2013 to find meaning, to discover her true self away from the everyday, away from her absent father, away from the shadow of her larger-than-life mother, away from everything that privilege can insulate from \u2013 is a masterful piece of fiction. Vijay writes with an assurance surprising in a first-time novelist, and is a delight to read. And while this is an in-depth expansion on the history and people of Jammu and Kashmir (humane but never sentimental), it is her protagonist who compels most, as Shalini watches her certainties gradually taken away from her and then returned laden with nuance and complexity. \u2022 The Far Field by Madhuri Vijay is published by Grove Press (\u00a314.99).
