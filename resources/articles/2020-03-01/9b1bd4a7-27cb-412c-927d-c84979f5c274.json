The Trump Make America Great Committee posted 2,000 iterations of an ad this week, asking users to respond to the \u201cOfficial Congressional District Census\u201d. Instead of information at the Census Bureau, however, the posts linked to a push-poll survey on the GOP fundraising site action.donaldjtrump.com, which also requests personal information for the campaign. Advocates said this could interfere with the actual census, which begins for most Americans with mailers in mid-March. The census is a once-in-a-decade event that seeks to count every person in the country, with drastic consequences for resource allocation and government representation nationwide. Trump\u2019s campaign had sponsored and posted the misleading ads on 2 and 3 March, according to Facebook\u2019s ad library, which archives political ads. Most of the posts have fewer than 2,000 impressions, or times it was on someone\u2019s screen, but several reached tens of thousands. The vast majority of those viewed by the Guardian cost less than $100. After asking questions such as \u201cDo you think Nancy Pelosi and the Radical Left are putting their personal anti-Trump agenda ahead of what\u2019s best for the American people?\u201d the site asks for a user\u2019s contact information. Terms of that website say that \u201cby providing your phone number, you are consenting to receive calls and SMS/MMS messages, including autodialed and automated calls and texts, to that number from each of the participating committees in the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, Donald J Trump for President and the Republican National Committee.\u201d A spokesperson for the Census Bureau refused to comment directly on the ads, but pointed to official guidelines that recommend Americans \u201cfight 2020 census rumors\u201d by reporting \u201cany advertisement on social media sharing fake 2020 census websites and inaccurate information\u201d. Facebook\u2019s stated policy on census misinformation bans \u201cmisrepresentation of the dates, locations, times and methods for census participation.\u201d A Facebook spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cThere are policies in place to prevent confusion around the official US census and this is an example of those being enforced.\u201d But the ads still made it through the initial vetting process and the company initially doubled down, saying that it was clear the ad wasn\u2019t referring to the \u201cofficial census\u201d, according to journalist Judd Legum. Facebook only began removing the posts Thursday after media inquiries and pressure from civil rights advocates such Vanita Gupta, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. Facebook announced last year it was doubling down on election-time misinformation. Since the midterm elections in 2018, Facebook\u2019s policy has prohibited content that easily leads to voter suppression and automatically prevents posts like that from being visible. The network said federal agencies and state election chiefs can tell the company directly about such posts, and took down a handful on Super Tuesday. But some experts say Facebook still is not equipped to handle election year misinformation. Meanwhile, this is not the first time the Trump administration\u2019s efforts have affected the census. Trump had originally attempted to include a question in the census of whether a respondent was a citizen \u2013 leading to fears the census could be used to intimidate people related to undocumented immigrants. That was overturned in a June 2019 supreme court decision, but census workers are still likely to deal with the residual effects. \u201cThe Trump administration has already sowed significant confusion about the census when it decided to push the now-dead citizenship question,\u201d said Tom Wolf, counsel at the Brennan Center\u2019s Democracy Program. \u201cWe\u2019re still cleaning up that mess.\u201d The Trump campaign did not respond to request for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
