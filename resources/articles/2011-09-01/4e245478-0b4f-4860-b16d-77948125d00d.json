Once you've got the hang of their language \u2013 their rhythms, grammar, vocabulary, syntax and all the rest \u2013 it becomes both easier and more enjoyable to experience architecture. And, whether you've set off on a trip to see specific buildings, or are just whiling away time in a town square, or waiting for a bus, the buildings surrounding you can truly take the place of text. One day, you won't need a guide to help you listen to the story of architecture. You'll have become fluent in a language at once as old as the pyramids and as contemporary as a swooping new design by Zaha Hadid. And what stories buildings tell. Collectively, they're the stuff of Dickens and Dostoevsky, Aeschylus and Sophocles, Dante and Petrarch, Joyce and Goethe, spelt out in concrete, stone, steel and glass. Mud and titanium, timber and terracotta, too. They tell tales of people who have lived, loved and worked inside them. They speak of the dark narratives of renegades, heretics and even kings executed outside their high, silent windows. They can recite epics concerning plagues, fires and revolutions, expound the story of gods and religion and mesmerise you with anecdotes about architects themselves \u2013 some gentlemanly and serious minded, some crooked, others close to insanity. I particularly like the English cartoonist Ronald Searle's drawings of St Custard's School in Geoffrey Willans's \"Down with Skool\" from 1953: a ridiculous, pastry-cutter style Regency \"Gothick\" pile is shown. Nigel Molesworth, hero of Willans's immortal tales, tells us that it \"was built by a madman in 1836\". This might just be true of your school (the madman bit, if not the date). It could even be said to be true of the Palace of Westminster, a machine for generating hot air in, stretched along the river Thames in central London. Architecture has so many stories to tell, that the historian and journalist John Gloag used it to tell the story of human civilisation itself in his very useful book The Architectural Interpretation of History (1975). Architecture and civilisation went hand-in-brick from the very beginning, starting \u2013 to the best of our knowledge \u2013 with the cities and ziggurats (towers) of ancient Sumeria, now hidden from the world in the deserts of southern Iraq. Architecture has framed our lives as nominally civilised beings for the best part of the past eight millennia. For most people, a latent understanding of architecture is nurtured in childhood, when even the simplest home can offer the delights of shadows, plays of light, the turn of stairs, and the idea of a shelter or haven that is also a place for dreams. Our homes are where we set off on our life's adventure. But most homes in the past were little more than hovels, while the majority of new houses built in Britain today are cynically cheap (to build, not to buy), and dismally crude. Even so, Britain \u2013 and especially England \u2013 is famous for its attitude to the home. Here home tends to be synonymous with the house \u2013 a solid, squareish building, preferably with a pitched roof, prominent chimneys and a pedimented door. When, as a child, I helped collect money door-to-door, exchanging wilting red paper roses for coins, I was fascinated that Londoners would still scrub doorsteps and protect the precious paint of front doors with outdoor curtains. Our homes mean so very much to us: in Britain we spend small fortunes making them over into Dettol-clean \"machines for living in\", although we shrink from this disturbingly modernist phrase, coined by radical Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier, who hoped to change our entire attitude to the house and thus to architecture at large. Of course, our homes are more than machines, yet for an architect like Le Corbusier, our homes are stepping stones to the wider, public world beyond. A world composed of buildings in a galaxy of contrasting forms and styles, purposes and functions. Temples and factories. Palaces and supermarkets. Castles and airports. Romanesque, gothic, baroque, rococo, modernist ... Over the centuries, all these building types and styles have been twisted and turned into any number of fascinating forms, some as cool as a block of ice, others as wild as a dog fight. And, here again, is the joy of architecture. There is the sheer proliferation of styles, and details \u2013 in your home town, let alone the rest of the world \u2013 to make sense of, and to revel in. There are rich quotes written into the architectural fabric all around you, even in the most familiar or apparently prosaic buildings that are easy to take for granted. How intriguing to find that the oh-so-very English Victorian town hall up the road from you speaks bastard French as well as 15th-century Florentine and even the Greek of Pericles. And look at that local authority estate over there \u2013 could those be quotes from Le Corbusier himself? For better or worse, they may well be. As you grow in confidence you can learn to read almost any building. Our collective history is written into their walls. Truly, every building tells a story.
