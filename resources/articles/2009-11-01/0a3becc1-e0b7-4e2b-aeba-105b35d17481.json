The announcement was a misunderstanding \u2014 a relaxation of border controls was meant to go into effect later \u2014 but led to tens of thousands of people heading to the border, where overwhelmed guards were forced to let them through. Now 80, Schabowksi lives in former West Berlin with his wife, but is very ill having had several strokes. He made these comments earlier this year. I could never in my life have imagined that it would be me who would announce the end of the GDR. But to get one thing straight \u2014 I announced the wall would open, but it was only the pressure by the people that made it possible. Only Egon Krenz [the head of the GDR] knew about the decision, the then district secretary of Karl-Marx Stadt [now Chemnitz], Siegfried Lorenz, and I. It was the three of us who pushed the opening through. The point of it was to boost the _standing of the SED in the eyes of the people which was completely lost. We really hoped the people would love us again after that. The fact that socialism was at an end was not clear to me at that stage. It came as a surprise to Gorbachev who rang his ambassador up on 10 November and was totally annoyed, not to say completely incensed. He wasn't against the opening of the wall as such, but wanted to determine the timing himself. He wanted the west to pay for the opening. I was excluded from the party for my actions. I was called a traitor and got murder threats. But I told my old comrades: you're cowards. If we hadn't opened the wall we could have found ourselves hanging from the lamp-posts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
