I don\u2019t know about you, but it feels to me like the individual days have dragged, while the week as a whole has flown, as we wait to find out for sure what America has decided. Joe Biden has moved closer still to taking the White House but there is not yet a conclusive result in the US presidential election \u2013 and Donald Trump has been filling the delay with false proclamations that his inevitable victory is being stolen away by fraud. The truth is that mainly because of Covid-19, about two-thirds of voters cast their ballots early, including by post, compared with one-third in 2016. Counting those papers is slower because they have to be opened and verified. Some states start verifying before election day, others do not. More Democratic voters submitted postal votes than Republicans \u2013 partly due to the parties\u2019 different views on Covid-safe voting. So the votes being counted now are tending strongly towards Biden in some areas. Here is your way in for continuing live coverage of the suspenseful election aftermath and we continue to tally the electoral college votes for each candidate when they are called to our satisfaction. As we publish the Briefing, Trump\u2019s lead is narrowing in Pennsylvania and Georgia. Pennsylvania would be the definite coup de gr\u00e2ce for his presidency, bringing Biden enough electoral college votes for the win. Democrats have also regained hope in the race for control of the Senate, with two key contests being sent to a run-off after neither Republican nor Democrat candidate won a majority. In a droning, deflated-sounding monologue from the White House press room, the president has reeled off a stream of florid lies about the validity of the election and drawn a false distinction between \u201clegal\u201d votes and those cast by mail \u2013 framing the latter as illegal, when they are not. Some television networks including MSNBC cut away from the speech in short order because of the president\u2019s lies, as Republican officialdom disowned his remarks and his support from Republican-leaning commentators appeared to implode in real time. Trump walked out after the speech without taking questions, meaning he could not be challenged on his manifold baseless assertions \u2013the biggest and fattest of which we have debunked here line by line. Larry Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland, wrote after the speech: \u201cThere is no defence for the president\u2019s comments tonight undermining our democratic process. America is counting the votes, and we must respect the results as we always have before. No election or person is more important than our democracy.\u201d Chris Christie, New Jersey\u2019s former Republican governor, said the president had the right to raise concerns but \u201cshow us the evidence. We heard nothing today about any evidence.\u201d The incumbent and his followers are furious at Fox News, which has been putting on an unaccustomed display of objectivity, calling states in favour of Biden and picking apart the president\u2019s claims. * * * Coronavirus latest \u2013 Overnight the government has closed the travel corridor with Denmark, meaning arrivals in the UK after 4am today will have to quarantine for 14 days. This is due to a variant strain of Covid infecting Danish-farmed mink and spreading to people. Liftoff for the Operation Moonshot rapid Covid testing initiative has not gone smoothly with a trial in Greater Manchester failing to detect more than 50% of positive cases, the Guardian can reveal. The tests are due to be used in the Liverpool trial of mass testing to begin today, but to what extent is now unclear. Charities and the mayor of London have called for the government to cancel plans to deport foreign rough sleepers and relaunch the \u201ceveryone in\u201d strategy to accommodate thousands of homeless people during the Covid second wave.

Eight died from their injuries, according to Ofsted. More than 300 \u201cserious incidents\u201d were notified to authorities between April and October. Almost 40% involved children under the age of one. Amanda Spielman, Ofsted\u2019s chief inspector, will say in a speech today that Covid lockdown is a \u201cpressure cooker\u201d that has created additional risk for young and vulnerable children in the most troubled families. Spielman will urge all professionals dealing with children \u2013 including midwives, health visitors, GPs, and staff of schools and nurseries \u2013 to work together to identify and protect vulnerable children in the second lockdown: \u201cWhile these children are out of sight, they should never be out of mind.\u201d * * * Brexit: UK \u2018not ready for 1 January\u2019 \u2013 Billions of pounds worth of trade with the EU will face \u201csignificant disruption\u201d after 1 January 2021 regardless of whether a post-Brexit trade deal is agreed, the National Audit Office (NAO) has concluded. Its report released today says IT systems have yet to be tested and border transit areas for lorries are not ready. Auditors also highlight concerns about the checks required for goods moving to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. HMRC still needs to make significant changes to its customs systems, even though planning for a no-deal Brexit began in 2017. Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: \u201cDisruption is likely and government will need to respond quickly to minimise the impact, a situation made all the more challenging by the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: Will Trump accept the result?
