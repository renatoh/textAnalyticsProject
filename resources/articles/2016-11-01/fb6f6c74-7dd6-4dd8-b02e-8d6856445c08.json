Such an overspend would be a setback for NHS England\u2019s chief executive, Simon Stevens, and Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, as they have pledged to ensure that trusts end the year no more than \u00a3250m in the red. The impending deficit, uncovered by the Health Service Journal, threatens to derail the agreement the NHS reached with the Treasury in July to \u201creset\u201d the service\u2019s disastrous finances this year in return for receiving \u00a33.8bn upfront of its planned \u00a38bn extra funding. The \u00a3850m sum emerged from figures supplied to the magazine by all but five of England\u2019s 237 NHS trusts, now more than halfway through the service\u2019s 2016-17 financial year, and its monitoring of trust boards\u2019 financial reports. \u201cThis is an embarrassment for Jeremy Hunt and shows the scale of the financial challenge in the NHS,\u201d said Jonathan Ashworth, Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary. \u201cAfter ending the last financial year with a record deficit, we were told that NHS trusts would get their deficits down to \u00a3250m. These projections show that target lies in tatters, with the true deficit likely to be triple that.\u201d The \u00a3850m is even bigger than the \u00a3550m-\u00a3580m overspend that some NHS leaders have said is the most the service can afford to overspend by this year without risking major financial problems. However, NHS Improvement, the health service\u2019s financial regulator, has already warned that a figure as high as \u00a3550m would make management of the overall NHS financial position very risky. Missing the \u00a3250m target by as much as \u00a3600m could make it more difficult for Hunt to balane the Department of Health\u2019s budget for this year. It would also raise uncomfortable questions about the effectiveness of the tough measures he has pushed through to try to get the NHS\u2019s finances back on track, such as limits on the amounts trusts can pay for temporary doctors and nurses from employment agencies. NHS finance experts argue that the true scale of the NHS\u2019s likely overspend in 2016-17 will be even greater as trusts are receiving \u00a31.8bn in emergency funding this year from a sustainability and transformation fund (STF) to help cover huge overspends incurred last year. If that turns out to be the case \u2013 and HSJ\u2019s projection proves accurate \u2013 the real deficit run up by trusts could be as much as \u00a32.65bn. A record \u00a32.45bn overspend was posted last year. NHS England and NHS Improvement agreed last month that what they call the provider sector\u2019s overspend for 2016-17 must be no more than \u00a3580m and reiterated their determination for it not to exceed \u00a3250m. HSJ found that after the first six months of 2016-17 \u2013 and before money from the STF was factored in \u2013 providers had overspent by \u00a31.56bn, a slight improvement on the deficit of \u00a31.61bn seen after the first half of the previous year. Sally Gainsbury, a senior policy analyst at the Nuffield Trust thinktank, said: \u201cIf the forecast deficit is \u00a3850m now, then it seems like it\u2019s only going to get worse throughout the rest of the year. Clinical commissioninggroups have been forced to hold back around \u00a3800m of their allocations this year, the 1% contingency fund, in case of overspending by trusts. And it looks as though the provider deficit will wipe that out completely.\u201d But Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents trusts, said: \u201cThere is a well-established plan to eliminate the provider sector deficit. Thanks to huge effort across all trusts, that plan is largely being delivered and is broadly on track. \u201cOur members tell us they will have to work even harder in the second half of 2016-17 if they are to successfully manage the significant risk in delivering the required year-end figure of \u00a3580m\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
