With the prime minister expected to fire the general election starting gun on Monday, expect a few policy termites to emerge from under the rubble of frantic electioneering. The Financial Services Authority to be part of the election battleground? You better believe it. This week the Conservatives proposed reforms of the FSA. One newspaper described this as part of a \"campaign to woo the City\". Surprisingly, a day later, there is nothing of the report by Richard Spring, the shadow treasury minister, on the Conservatives' website. Although the Tories believe they have identified another vote-winner, they are perhaps realistic about the breadth of its appeal. Just how many new votes it might win is, indeed, debatable. Already, if the rammed cocktail parties of the recently founded Conservative City Circle are any gauge, the grandees of the Square Mile have returned to the Tory fold. Some have indulged in a mild flirtation with New Labour over the past decade. Others have withheld their active services, and closed their wallets, without actually switching electoral allegiance. Now, though, it is no longer considered shaming to shout one's support for the Tories in ECs 1 to 4. It is, of course, wrong to assume that there are no long-standing Labour supporters among the City's establishment - nor that those who have supported New Labour did so either expediently or temporarily. But it is fair to assume that, whatever their political hue, the majority of the City's leadership has serious concerns about the functioning of the FSA. Indeed, even those of the establishment now on the FSA's payroll must be concerned at the general perception of the regulator, whatever their working experience within its Canary Wharf tower. Cynics (who rightly enjoy a brisk trade in any election run-up) might argue that the release of Mr Spring's report has been timed as an antidote to the reported unrest within City ranks at the hasty fall from grace of Howard Flight. The serial non-executive director and current MP for Arundel and South Downs has been instrumental in the charm offensive conducted by the Conservatives within the financial community. Many in the City will recognise from their own experience the dilemma Michael Howard found himself in when Mr Flight's controversial comments about his party's spending plans were publicised. Some might conclude that the best response in commerce is often more subtle than the effective excommunication enacted by Mr Howard. Others might hanker for the old days in which such brutal trampling on an individual's employment rights was possible in business. A tilt at the FSA - let's face it, a fair target - may merely be a reminder that the business of the Conservative party under Howard is bigger than any individual. And that it is a business in tune with business, just in case that was in any doubt. If the Conservatives' plans for financial regulation were to be implemented, they would transport the financial sector back to the days of \"my word is my bond\". Today, unfortunately, it is impossible to rely on the traditional handshake that used to underpin the reputation of the City. It seems unrealistic to believe that such a system of trust could be resurrected. The Tories wish to replace prescriptive rules with principle-based regulation; to subject business to prudential oversight only; to apply a lighter regulatory touch to products aimed at the wealthy; to exempt hedge funds and private equity funds from regulation; to appoint an independent board to hold the FSA to account. And to reduce the size of the regulator. All of which might, in theory, have entrepreneurs in the financial services industry rubbing their hands with glee, but is likely to have their compliance officers groaning in anticipation of the soup of uncertainty that reg-lite would create. Consumers, perhaps frustrated at the FSA's failure to nail the industry's miscreants, are unlikely to find salvation in a regime which so readily allows the \"it fits my interpretation of the principles\" defence. Moreover, any reduction in the FSA's overheads that cut into the resources of its enforcement division would be a retrograde step. What enforcement really needs is a champion prepared to put the identification and conviction of the City's regulatory wrongdoers at the heart of the FSA's purpose. An Eliot Spitzer for Britain, if you like, but a crusader embedded within the regulatory system, rather than working from left field as New York's attorney general has done. If the Tories stopped the spin for long enough to think about it, this could be the real vote-winner. It carries the risk of alienating its recently reactivated City supporters. But, as Labour realised a decade ago, you must take the greatest liberties with your core electoral franchise in your search for the swing voters. \u00b7 Edmond Warner is chief executive of IFX Group edmond.warner@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
