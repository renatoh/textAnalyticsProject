Australia had hoped the protein vaccine would be available by mid-2021. Phase one clinical trials in humans began in July in Brisbane, with phase two and three clinical trials due to commence in December. It is one of four vaccines secured by the Australian government. But on Friday the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said: \u201cUniversity of Queensland vaccine will not be able to proceed based on the scientific advice, and that will no longer feature as part of Australia\u2019s vaccine plan. \u201cI think the decision we\u2019ve made today should give Australians great assurance that we are proceeding carefully, we are moving swiftly, but not with any undue haste here,\u201d he said. \u201cOur processes will not be compromised. At the end of the day, the Therapeutic Goods Administration \u2013 like with any vaccine in Australia \u2013 must give their tick-off. Without the tick, there\u2019s no jab when it comes to vaccines in this country. That is true for the Covid-19 vaccine, as it is true for any other vaccine that is administered here in Australia.\u201d In a statement issued on Friday morning, CSL said \u201cfollowing consultation with the Australian government, CSL will not progress the vaccine candidate to phase 2/3 clinical trials\u201d. The Covid-19 \u201cspike protein\u201d has been the focus of the University of Queensland vaccine, using molecular clamp technology to lock the protein into a shape which allows the immune system to be able to recognise and then neutralise the virus. Covid\u2019s spike proteins, like most surface viral proteins, are fairly unstable. To ensure that the vaccine induced the right immune response, the clamp chosen comprises two fragments of a protein found in HIV, as those fragments provided the greatest stability to the vaccine. Adding those fragments to the spike protein is completely harmless. Trial participants were advised of the possibility that vaccine-induced HIV antibodies might be detected as a result, but it was nonetheless unexpected. Subsequent HIV tests provided definitive negative results in the trial participants. While the HIV tests were false positives and there was no risk to the trial participants, significant changes would need to be made to well-established HIV testing procedures to accommodate rollout of this vaccine, the researchers said. The Phase 1 trial will continue, where further analysis of the data will show how long the antibodies persist. University of Queensland vice-chancellor Prof Deborah Terry said while the outcome was disappointing, she was proud of the research team. \u201cI also want to thank our many partners, our donors, including the federal and Queensland government \u2013 and of course the 216 Queenslanders who so willingly volunteered for the Phase 1 trials,\u201d she said. Vaccine co-lead Prof Paul Young said that although it was possible to re-engineer the vaccine, the team did not have the time needed. \u201cDoing so would set back development by another 12 or so months, and while this is a tough decision to take, the urgent need for a vaccine has to be everyone\u2019s priority,\u201d he said. The health minister, Greg Hunt, said the announcement proved the \u201cscientific process was working\u201d. He said while the HIV results were false, \u201cthe scientific advice is that the risk to vaccine confidence was the principal issue here\u201d. The national security committee and scientific committee were \u201cunanimous\u201d not to proceed with the CSL agreement, Hunt said. Morrison said Australians should not be concerned that there would not be enough vaccines as a result of the University of Queensland vaccine being dropped. Australia has entered into enough different vaccine agreements to cover the Australian population, even if one or two vaccine candidates proved unsuccessful. With the University of Queensland candidate being discontinued, Australia still has 140m units of vaccine available to Australia, which Hunt said is \u201cone of the highest ratios of vaccine purchases and availability to population in the world\u201d. All vaccine candidates require two doses. \u201cWhat we can do is vaccinate our population twice over,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cAnd we have one of the highest ratios of availability of doses of any country in the world. So this is a demonstration of the success of the vaccination policy and approach that we have been following.\u201d He said 31m doses of two other vaccine candidates had been secured in light of the University of Queensland news. Federal department of health secretary Prof Brendan Murphy said he was confident the other three vaccine candidates would not have similar issues, as two had already published promising data from phase 3 trials. Murphy said the reason the government invested in four candidates was because they expected not all would come to fruition. \u201cWe\u2019re very confident we won\u2019t see this issue with the other vaccines,\u201d Murphy said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
