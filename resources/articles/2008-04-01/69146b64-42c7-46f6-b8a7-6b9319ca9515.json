If you're lucky, it's a piece of art or a beautiful building. A Statue of Liberty, an Angel of the North, even a big red bus. In Sheffield, our landmark is a pair of disused cooling towers on the edge of the city. These towers are a pretty ambiguous symbol. They reflect the fact that this was once the greatest industrial city in the world, but also that this industry is now long gone. That Full Monty view of the city might be the one you have: Jobcentres, Jarvis Cocker, knives and forks. But that view is wildly inaccurate. We at Go fanzine -dedicated to all things Sheffield - wanted to tell the world about the city we knew: the hills, the music, the people, the talent. So we had an idea. We'd re-use these towers as massive new spaces for art. In one fell swoop, we'd change everyone's opinion of the city, give it a new identity. We began with an ideas competition in the fanzine. From there, we heard about Channel 4's Big Art Project, a national initiative to nominate sites for public art. We entered and, in April 2006, we won. We developed the idea of a changing programme of art for the towers, which would be like a Tate Modern Turbine Hall for the north. We flew to Germany to see an example of our idea in action (the Gasometer at Oberhausen). We even got Anish Kapoor to come up with the first one. At this point, we started to get excited. After all, there's nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come, right? Wrong. Two things are more powerful. One is E.ON: a mega-corporation that burns lots of coal. It owns the towers. It wants to knock them down. Nothing we've said has changed its commitment to doing so. The second is a lack of vision. We presented our local council with national media coverage, funding to do it, and an international work of art to start it all off. Their response? 'That's nice, dear.' Soon the towers will be demolished but we won't let it lie. We're going to celebrate our landmarks in the way other cities celebrate theirs: by opening a gift shop. We've commissioned amazing artists to produce all of the memorabilia you'd usually find for a civic icon: cups, plates, tea towels. And we're going to sell it on a stall, in Sheffield's Millennium Galleries, for two weeks only. The towers will be like concrete martyrs: another good idea that didn't happen, because the people in charge didn't get it until it was too late. Another example of doing the easy thing, instead of the best thing. dontgo.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
