Stories from the New World, after the voyages of Columbus and Vespucci, told of \u201cnaked peoples\u201d and equated the nude with the primitive. Cranach shows just such an imagined culture in this painting \u2013 and has fun picturing it. His savage men and women are violent and uninhibited, existing with no knowledge of the Christian god or conception of sin. His attention to the bodies of the women, seen from front and behind, standing up and lying down, suggests he finds such a state of nature a fascinating prospect.
