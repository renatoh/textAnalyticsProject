He also left behind an unfinished autobiography, which provides much of the source material for a new docudrama to be broadcast on BBC2 on Saturday in the UK. When we published a news story about some of the themes in Terry Pratchett: Back in Black, readers provided thoughtful, and often emotional perspectives and tributes. In a discussion that largely focused on what the writer called the \u201chaze of Alzheimer\u2019s\u201d in his later days, you talked about what he meant to you, and also some of your personal experiences with the disease and the dementia it can cause. There are also revelations about his earlier life that fans may not have known and will be keen to see on screen. As it airs, this is your opportunity to discuss the docudrama, which the BBC describes as \u201cpoignant and humorous\u201d but which will perhaps again provoke strong emotional response. Have you been watching? What were the most interesting or surprising aspects of Pratchett\u2019s life on screen? What did you think of Paul Kaye\u2019s portrayal of the writer? Share your thoughts in the comments below. Terry Pratchett: Back in Black is on BBC2 at 9pm on Saturday 11 February (and available on iPlayer shortly afterwards)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
