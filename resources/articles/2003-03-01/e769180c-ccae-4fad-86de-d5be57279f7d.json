Despite the threat of a backbench rebellion over his plans to set up foundation trusts, Mr Milburn said that similar semi-autonomous status would be extended to the best primary care trusts (PCTs) and GP practices. \"We are already exploring how the concept of earned autonomy can be applied to PCTs so that those who are performing best get more freedoms,\" he told the annual conference of the National Association for Primary Care in London. \"And the concept should not stop there. I will be looking at how [GP] practices should benefit from earned autonomy.\" The health secretary said that the new GP contract, published last week, \"could mark a turning point in the history of primary care\". He said that the proposed deal, under which doctors would receive extra pay for providing \"enhanced\" services such as minor surgery, recognised GP practices \"as the cornerstone of primary care, which should enjoy greater devolution of responsibility and greater freedom\". Mr Milburn has come under fire from 116 MPs who fear his plans to give freedoms to some hospitals will lead to a two-tier health service. Following criticism from health service managers that PCTs lack sufficient resources and expertise to operate effectively, the health secretary announced plans to build up their management capacity though a national development programme and the new NHS University. This would ensure that \"every PCT in every part of the country has the information, the skills and the resources to get the best deal for patients\", he said. Private healthcare companies, including US firms Kaiser Permanente and United Healthcare, will play a greater role in the delivery and commissioning of primary care services. \"In the months to come we will want to find ways of more PCTs benefiting from such an approach,\" said Mr Milburn. The government also wants PCTs to provide more services currently only offered in hospitals, including surgery. PCTs in Dudley, Milton Keynes, Salford and Southend-on-Sea already employ consultants in mental health and paediatrics. Mr Milburn said more PCTs should follow their lead and encouraged them to further extend the range of traditionally hospital-based services provided in primary care. He said: \"This is about securing greater integration in services. It is about overcoming the divide between hospital-based care and community-based care. \"I hope that PCTs will now consider how to extend these employment opportunities for consultants to surgical and other specialties.\" GPs and primary care nurses will be given more opportunity to provide specialist services such as eye tests, said the health secretary. Later this month the Department of Health (DoH) will publish draft guidelines, drawn up with the Royal College of General Practitioners, for accrediting GPs with specialist training in dermatology, diabetes, orthopaedics and neurology. It will also publish guidelines for establishing similar specialist posts for nurses working in primary care."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
