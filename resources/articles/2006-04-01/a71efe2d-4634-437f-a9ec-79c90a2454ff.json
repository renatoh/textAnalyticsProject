The party wants 30-second broadcasts in answer to the question: \"What would you do to improve your local environment?\" The clips will be edited and used in all three slots made available to the Conservatives for their party political broadcasts before May's local elections. \"This is the first time this has been done in Britain,\" the Tory leader, David Cameron, said yesterday. \"We want to encourage people from all walks of life to participate in politics and put the public at the centre of our politics.\" The move is emblematic of Mr Cameron's determination to use technology to reach voters. The party is looking at ways of using a form of text message voting by supporters to select its candidate for the London mayoral elections via a US-style \"primary\". Cameras will also be available during stops on Mr Cameron's local election tour, allowing technophobes to deliver their responses too. In Hampshire yesterday, Mr Cameron said: \"Every year parties make party political broadcasts which are very dry, featuring politicians saying what they want to do.\" The broadcast slots last three to four minutes. Other material will be used on the Conservatives' website. Webcam clips can be sent to video@conservatives.tv and mobile phone responses to 07725 822460, with the word CHANGE as the title of the text message."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
