The Tory MP, Hoggart wrote recently, was rather like one of those polar bears stranded on a shrinking chunk of glacier. For generations, men like Cormack ran the Conservative party and the country: waist-coated figures of some stature who spoke in stentorian tones and wrote with a flourish of a fat fountain pen. For 37 years, Cormack has served the good folk of South Staffordshire, a pillar of the local community and a familiar face rising from the backbenches in the House of Commons. The party that once cherished tradition is changing, though, reshaped by David Cameron and his bright youngish things. In February, out of the blue, and with the next election not even imminent, the Conservative association in South Staffordshire deselected Cormack. Despite 10 election victories to his name, at 67, it seems, he is too old and too old-fashioned to represent modern Conservatism. Truly audacious idleness or sensational lapses of judgment are usually the only grounds for sacking Tory MPs from safe seats. Even when hit by scandal, most incumbents hang on: Tim Smith was reselected by his Beaconsfield constituency association in 1995 despite the cash-for-questions affair; this year North Wiltshire MP James Gray survived a deselection attempt after having an affair while his wife battled cancer. But even Cormack's enemies agree he has an unblemished parliamentary record. There is no whiff of personal scandal. As for his popular appeal, in 2005 he romped back into the Commons with a 8,847 majority and the biggest swing to the Conservatives of the general election. Even merciless parliamentary sketch writers, from Hoggart to Quentin Letts, have voiced disapproval at the cruel hunting down of one of the last Tory knights of the shires. When Cormack was invited to a meeting of the constituency executive in February, he had little idea of the mutinous mood. Last year, the local party elected a new constituency chairman and membership rose by 25% to more than 500. New rules were enforced. Traditionally, Cormack had been readopted on a show of hands at the AGM: a simple formality, according to association president, Wilhelm Rose. Now there was an interrogation by the executive committee and a secret ballot. Cormack was sacked by a majority of one. After 37 years service the MP was visibly wounded. \"I was ambushed,\" he says. Accounts of the meeting differ, but several attendees claim Cormack declared he would stand as an independent if rejected by his party. \"His behaviour was appalling,\" says executive member Stevie Brinkman. \"When it was announced he had been deselected, he said: 'I tell you now my name will be on the ballot paper. Even if it is as an independent, my name will be on the ballot paper'. I feel that Patrick is more concerned with being Father of the House or the Speaker - these are his main reasons for wanting to stay in Westminster. It's not for the party or South Staffordshire.\" Knighted in 1995, Cormack was promoted by William Hague to deputy leader of the House of Commons after 27 years on the backbenches, returning to them after a failed bid to become Speaker. Even implacable opponents, such as local Conservative Dennis Charnell, accept that Cormack is a highly-diligent constituency MP. Charnell has no beef with his age (like most activists, he is of the same generation) but chastises him for burying the word \"Conservative\" in his election literature - and for betraying Thatcher. Cormack, who describes himself as a \"one-nation Tory\", was one of two - just two - Conservative MPs bold enough to oppose the poll tax. \"We had a petition to deselect him after Margaret Thatcher, but were defeated,\" says Charnell. \"He stabbed Mrs Thatcher in the back.\" Cormack, however, believes that voters appreciate his independent spirit. \"I've had masses of letters from people who say they vote for me not because I'm Conservative but because they think I'm an independent-minded local parliamentarian. I've always taken the line it's country-constituency-party, in that order.\" Ask around in most constituencies and, if voters know who their MP is, they seldom have anything nice to say about them. Most ordinary voters in affluent South Staffs are unusually positive about Cormack. \"He's got a lot of support in the area. After 37 years, he hasn't sat on his backside,\" says a shopkeeper in Pattingham. \"If you contact him he's conscientious and he sees it through,\" reckons Susan Marsh. \"He's a very suitable man,\" says a passing pensioner, firmly. Boxleys butchers in Wombourne are full of praise for their MP, who is partial to their Staffordshire beef. \"He's always got time to talk to anyone,\" says David Bradley, the manager. \"He's down-to-earth, he'll never ignore anybody and he's done some good things for Wombourne.\" He is also fighting back. Constituents, Tory peers and even Lib Dem and Labour MPs, have sent Cormack letters of support. Eighty-two Conservative MPs, including rightwingers, the old and the young, signed a letter to South Staffs association praising Cormack as an \"outstanding parliamentarian\" with \"unimpeachable integrity\". Crucially, a number of irregularities were uncovered at the meeting where he was deselected. There were 27 committee members at the meeting yet 29 votes were cast. Cormack's supporters claimed that up to four committee members were not informed about the meeting. Central Office investigated and Angela Browning, the party's deputy chairman, ruled that Cormack could have grounds for a legal challenge. The vote was declared void and the MP's fate will now be decided at a second, extraordinary executive meeting in May. Ahead of the new vote, the Firs, the constituency HQ in Codsall, is in turmoil. A snooker table and dusty shelves of trophies are about the only things untouched by the builders. There's modernising work going on; Cormack has moved his constituency office to another village. Health and safety regs decreed it, explains Dave Billson, the association chairman, who is sitting in the bare room that used to be Cormack's office alongside Robert Marshall, one of his deputies. At first glance, this scene looks a bit like the conspiracy alleged by Cormack's supporters, who claim that a coterie of local councillors plotted this coup for months. \"Patrick always sees the best in people and couldn't imagine this was going on,\" says one. \"They are little men and they got a bit of power and it goes to their heads,\" says another. Billson, a former police officer, firmly denies talk of a plot and insists that, as chairman, he will support whoever is the official candidate. \"But,\" he says, \"times have changed. Certain people are not happy with him.\" \"Certain people\" include Marshall, a beady-eyed district and county councillor. \"We now need to appeal to the whole constituency and not just the sections we may like,\" says Billson, who wants the party to attract the blue-collar 20 and 30-somethings who \"are the future of South Staffs\". \"Not just the rich,\" Marshall chips in. So the argument is that Cormack does not appeal to hardworking young families? \"You might say that. I couldn't possibly comment,\" says Marshall with a smirk. \"I'm a traditionalist but something has got to change. This new chap came along who we all think is wonderful - Cameron - and I think South Staffs is basically moving with the times.\" They recently held a new members' evening. \"About 20 people came to a little wine and cheese here,\" recalls Marshall. \"Sir Patrick said a few words and I heard a lady point at him and say, 'That's the reason why we keep losing elections - that's what people don't like'. Politics is about people, and I think you could argue maybe he's a little bit removed from the ordinary chap. I wish he wouldn't speak like he does because I'm sure there are more votes in speaking like an ordinary man.\" The phrase that recurs most among local \"anti-Patrick\" Tories is that it is \"time for a change\". They see their seat as a flagship and want to feel part of the Cameroonian conversion. \"Sir Patrick is stereotypical of what you would think of a Conservative MP,\" says executive member David Heseltine. \"Given how David Cameron says he wants the party to appear, this would be a good time for Sir Patrick to step aside and let new blood in. If Cameron wants more young people or female MPs, then ours is an ideal seat.\" Without being asked, Marshall tackles the theory that he covets Sir Patrick's job. \"As soon as this happened there was a rumour put around saying there's a local councillor after his job, meaning me, and I'm not,\" he says. On her living room wall, Wilhelm Rose, the president of South Staffs Tories, has a cushion embroidered by her daughter that says: \"I'm not really 80, I'm 18 with 62 years experience.\" With a sharp eye for a funny story, Rose has been a party member for more than 60 years (and has a framed letter of thanks from Cameron to prove it). She worked for Enoch Powell (\"Very interesting, lovely man, been proved right\") and when she met Cormack she thought, \"Well, here's another man that I would be very willing to do anything for. After Enoch Powell I thought I'd never find another man like this, but Patrick so impressed me.\" Rose says she has been accosted on the streets since the deselection. \"I can't go out of the house without people coming at me, clamouring 'What have you done? What have you done?' It has given the Conservatives a very bad name,\" she says. Far from being a Tory dinosaur hopelessly out of touch with young, blue-collar voters, she says, Cormack has a talent for reaching those who are not natural Tories. \"When you're canvassing, so many people say 'I'm not really Conservative but I vote for Sir Patrick', Patrick mixes with all sorts of people.\" \"I think they used age as an excuse,\" she continues. \"He's such a vital person. It's ridiculous to talk about his age, it really is. When Patrick was canvassing we went to the local Church of England primary school. We sat down with some little ones with our rosettes on. The teacher asked if they knew who Patrick was. A little boy asked, 'Is he the Pope?' Patrick roared with laughter. He gets on well with young people.\" If Cormack is sacked for a second time at the next association meeting, he can appeal to South Staffs' 500 members, although he would be weakened without the executive's endorsement. If he loses that vote, there is little realistic chance of being reselected as Tory candidate at the next general election. Would he stand as an independent? Cormack insists he is only focusing on remaining the Conservative candidate: \"I don't want to talk about any alternatives.\" After deselection, Cormack bumped into Cameron at the unveiling of the statue of Margaret Thatcher in the Commons. \"He expressed his concern and commiserations, but I'm afraid leaders like to keep things at arms length,\" he says, gathering up sheaths of supportive correspondence in his office. Here there is no blogging, and no plans to pose with huskies or put a wind turbine on his roof. \"There's nothing worse than an old person trying to be trendy,\" as Rose says. Sir Patrick Cormack is fighting on, his way: by writing and receiving letters. \"I may have a nice office and I'm very grateful but I never arrive in this room later than 7.45am and frequently I'm here until after 7pm,\" he harrumphs softly. The sky is darkening over Westminster Square. If his time is up, like the polar bears, the last of the Tory grandees will go with dignity and quiet indignation. \"I do regard being an MP not as a job but a way of life,\" he says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
