Cartoon-dykons are characters such as TankGirl, BatGirl and Lara Croft ('My favourite animated dykon is still Velma in Scooby Doo.') Tele-dykons are TV personalities who, intentionally or not, attract a sapphic following ('Does it matter if she's a \"bona fide sista\" or not? Switch it on!') Author Stephen Tropiano wrote in his book Prime Time Closet of gays appearing slowly on television. Dr Kerry Weaver of ER fame inspired respect ('the most real-life TV dykon'). Tipping the Velvet brought 'lesbianism to the mid-week mainstream'. But TV-dykonography goes much broader than this, being anything identified on the telly as iconically appealing to lesbian viewers. Daytime Dykonography, specifically, is what appears - causing particular celebration - in the morning or afternoon. 'We both had the day off,' says a dykonographer, 'so we checked out Catherine Bach in an old episode of the Dukes of Hazard, Portia in a lunchtime repeat of McBeal, Nigella, the Barbara Stanwyck film on two, Mel's arms and hair on Today With Des &amp; Mel, and then we tidied up before Jennifer Aniston.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
