Lawyers for the twins, who now control the group, claim Paddy McKillen had previously sought to hoodwink his fellow shareholders in Coroin. His alleged attempts failed, however, as Sir David and Sir Frederick ultimately secured a majority interest. Kenneth MacLean QC, counsel for the brothers, told the high court in London that McKillen owed about \u20ac240m to Anglo Irish Bank by the end of 2010 as the banking world he knew had \"fallen apart\". Among his biggest investments was the luxury London hotel group, which also included the Connaught and the Berkeley. But this business too was struggling too, its \u00a3660m debts transferred to NAMA, Ireland's state-backed toxic loan book. MacLean told the court that McKillen's determination to secure a lucrative outcome for himself \u2013 allegedly at the expense of fellow shareholders in the hotels business \u2013 \"would make avarice itself blush\". McKillen is one of a band of Irish investors who founded investment vehicle Coroin to acquire the hotels in 2004 using large borrowings from now-distressed Irish banks. When the business later got into financial difficulties, according to McKillen, the Barclays pounced. The brothers are accused of offering \"unlawful\" side payments to the family of Derek Quinlan, another Coroin shareholder, in order to ensure he transferred his stake in the company to the Barclays. Quinlan's holding effectively had no value to him personally as it was pledged as security for bank loans well in excess of the value of shares. The Barclays have insisted payments to Quinlan and his family, who had been in financial difficulty, were the actions of family friends. They were, the brothers have insisted, wholly separate from commercial discussions over Quinlan's stake in Coroin. Turning the tables on McKillen, lawyers for the Barclay brothers suggested that he had himself been highly seeking a lucrative side deal with Coroin suitors from Qatar. His shares, MacLean said, had been pledged to his banks, meaning a direct sale would generate little or no value for him. McKillen accepted that he had discussed with people representing the Qatari ruling al-Thani family a possible sale of Coroin that included a side deal involving a management contract for himself. MacLean said the proposal to pay management fees of \u00a35m a year for between three and five years after a sale \"could not possibly be justified ... [and] was really an inducement for selling your shares\". The case continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
