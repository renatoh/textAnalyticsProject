In a little noticed section of his speech, the chancellor said current public spending would increase by 0.8% a year between 2011-12 and 2014-15. This will feel painful because it is lower than recent increases in public spending that have often outstripped the overall growth in the economy. But the modest 0.8% figure is still a rise, allowing the government to claim that it will increase spending. The chancellor's words need close inspection, however. He only referred to current spending and not overall spending. Darling made no mention of capital expenditure which is set to fall dramatically in the next spending round from 2011. Capital expenditure is mentioned in the Treasury literature released with the PBR. But this is in a different context \u2013 it is forecast to fall to 1.3% of GDP \u2013 making it difficult to come to an overall figure on government spending from 2011. This has echoes of the row during the summer when Gordon Brown claimed that voters would face a choice between \"Labour investment and Tory cuts\". He made this claim on the basis of current spending, stripping out capital expenditure. Fraser Nelson, the editor of the Spectator, who set the agenda during the row in the summer, has blogged on this. We will have to wait for the comprehensive response to the PBR by Institute for Fiscal Studies to answer this question: did the chancellor set capital expenditure aside because he would have had to admit that overall government spending will fall from 2011?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
