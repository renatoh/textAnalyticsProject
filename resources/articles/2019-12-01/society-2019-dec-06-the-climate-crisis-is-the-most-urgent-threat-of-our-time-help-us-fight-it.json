This year, our theme is the climate emergency and our support goes to charities whose work is essential for the renewal of nature and the planet: not just planting new trees but protecting and restoring existing forest, woodland and other natural habitats in the UK and in the Amazon basin of South America. As Guardian and Observer readers, we hope you will have appreciated our comprehensive reporting on the causes of the climate crisis, from fossil-fuel burning and rainforest-clearing to pollution-emitting cars and planes. We\u2019ve tracked the destructive consequences, including forest fires, melting ice caps, extreme weather events such as droughts and flash floods and filthy air. We\u2019ve reported the evolving science of global heating and followed the emergence of a wave of youth-led eco-activism led by Greta Thunberg. We\u2019ve covered the fight of environmental and land rights activists across the planet against ecologically destructive corporate and political interests. We remain focused on the urgent giant policy steps that governments, businesses and consumers can and must take to avoid climate catastrophe. This year\u2019s charity appeal highlights ways we as citizens can support practical, natural solutions to climate change. Planting and protecting trees is a positive way that we can help. Trees are vital in producing oxygen and absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. They provide a natural habitat for animals, birds and insects and stem the decline of biodiversity. They can prevent flooding and soil erosion. They provide shelter and shade, and reduce air and noise pollution. Forests and woodlands are natural sources of beauty, wellbeing and peace. We are partnering with four fantastic charities: Global Greengrants Fund UK links social and environmental justice, providing resources for indigenous communities in the Amazon basin to help them peacefully protect their land rights from commercial encroachment and resist the destruction of precious rainforest. Woodland Trust plants millions of trees, creating new woods and forests in the UK as part of its Big Climate Fightback, while restoring and protecting existing ones from developers, pollution and disease. It manages and cares for 1,000 woods, each freely open to the public. Trees for Life aims to rewild thousands of hectares of the Scottish Highlands, providing natural solutions to the climate crisis while enabling native trees birds, mammals, trees and insects to thrive and flourish and creating a unique space for people to enjoy the healing power of wild nature. Trees for Cities works with local communities in socially deprived areas of the UK to plant trees in schools and parks, housing estates and woodlands. Its aim is to tackle the climate crisis, encourage social cohesion, improve air quality and beautify neglected urban spaces. In recent years, Guardian and Observer readers have raised millions through our annual appeal for topical causes that reflect our shared commitment to a fairer, more just society, from supporting refugees and campaigning against homelessness to fighting Windrush immigration injustices. The climate emergency \u2013 the most urgent issue of our time \u2013 felt to us to be a compelling choice for the 2019 appeal. Over the next few weeks, our website and newspapers will highlight the work of our charity partners. We hope we can inspire you to give generously and help protect the planet we share.
