Walsh, who exposed Armstrong's links with the Italian trainer Michele Ferrari, currently in court on drugs allegations, sat a few yards from the Texan, separated only by a bank of cameras and a baize table as the five-times Tour winner gave his press conference. LA Confidential, which contains the extensive testimony of Emma O'Reilly, a former masseuse in Armstrong's US Postal Service team, was mentioned once amid banalities about his form (\"I feel stronger than last year\"), his rock-star girlfriend Sheryl Crow (\"she's here\") and the course. The question asked most here, usually in a whisper, is \"have you read the book?\" but Armstrong limited himself to a single Blue Peter-style statement, delivered with the sarcastic rider \"especially because our esteemed author is here\". \"I think extraordinary declarations must be followed up with extraordinary proof. Mr Walsh and [co-writer] Mr Ballester have worked for four or five years and have not come up with extraordinary proof. The case is complicated and long but I will spend whatever it takes and however long it takes.\" The defending champion has sought an injunction against the book asking that a card be inserted stating that it contains defamatory material. The case was thrown out by a Paris judge last week but his appeal is due to be heard today. Armstrong has made other accusations, notably that the writers \"spoke to hundreds, perhaps thousands of people and found only two willing to make totally false accusations\". The writers, however, insist that theirs is a serious investigation and they are merely presenting the information for the public to make up their minds. Armstrong was more approving of the Tour organisers' decision to refuse entry to riders involved in doping inquiries. The Italian Danilo di Luca, who was brought to the race by the Saeco Coffee Machines team but has been placed under investigation with 14 other riders in Italy over doping allegations, was refused yesterday. Tour organisers are examining the cases of three other riders: the Italians Stefano Zanini and Andrea Peron and the Czech Pavel Padrnos, a team-mate of Armstrong. The cases date back to 2001, in Italy, and their status is unclear. There was no doubt over the case of the Spaniard Gorka Gonz\u00e1lez, who was thrown out yesterday after being found \"unhealthy\" in the blood tests carried out on all cyclists before the Tour begins. He was found with an abnormal level of reticulocytes - young blood cells - which are checked to restrict the administration of EPO. While not officially a drug test, he will be examined further and will not race until declared \"healthy\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
