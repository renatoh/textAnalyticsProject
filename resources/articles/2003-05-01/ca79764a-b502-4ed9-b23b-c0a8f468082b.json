And little more than half an hour later the Essex side prevailed on penalties. Dagenham, who missed out last season when finishing second on goal difference to Boston United, who were later found guilty of financial irregularities, had been left with a lingering sense of injustice this term. They will now have a chance to rectify that when they face Doncaster Rovers at Stoke's Britannia Stadium. Things had looked grim for Garry Hill's side when Adriano Rigoglioso fired Morecambe into an aggregate lead with only four minutes remaining. But Terry struck soon after to take the tie into extra-time and Tony Roberts, the Dagenham goalkeeper once of Wales and QPR, settled matters with two excellent saves in the shootout. \"I'm very emotional for the players who have worked so hard to overcome the disappointment of last season,\" Hill said. \"When we were in 15th position in November they could easily have folded but they have turned things around magnificently. \"I always think you have one big blow in a season and hopefully ours was going out to Norwich [1-0] in the FA Cup fourth round, and it won't be next weekend in the final.\" Morecambe, trailing 2-1 from the first leg, cancelled out the deficit when the Daggers striker Steve West sliced into his own goal five minutes after the interval. And Rigoglioso's close-range effort appeared to have settled it, until Terry's intervention. Despite chances aplenty, neither side could find the golden goal that would have curtailed the contest and the shootout continued the drama, with Dagenham establishing and then surrendering a two-goal advantage before Tarkan Mustafa struck the decisive penalty. \"We are a young side and we will only get better,\" said Jim Harvey, Morecambe's manager. \"I am sure we will be at least in the play-offs next season.\" Morecambe (4-4-2): Mawson; McKearney, Murphy, Bentley, Perkins (Ubershar, 52); Thompson, Stringfellow, Drummond, Elam; Rigoglioso (Talbot, 99), Curtis (Carlton, 67). Dagenham (4-4-2): Roberts; Mustafa, Cole, Matthews, Goodwin; Janney (Heffer, 67), Shipp, Terry, McGrath (Broom, 110); Stein, West (Smith, 105).
