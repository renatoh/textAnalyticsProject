There were fears the cup would fold after last week's decision by Premier Rugby and Ligue Nationale de Rugby not to sign an accord to replace the expiring one , the English clubs protesting at the refusal of the Rugby Football Union to give them some of its shares on the organising body, European Rugby Cup Ltd. Mark McCafferty, chief executive of Premier Rugby, said the clubs were prepared to sign a new accord, replacing the one which ends in 2009, as long as it was for seven years and allowed them a shareholding. He added: \"We have no intention or desire to break away from the RFU but we accept that if, for whatever reason, we ceased to be in the competition, we could not hold on to the shares.\" The RFU management board chairman, Martyn Thomas, said: \"That is a seismic shift by Premier Rugby and addresses our key concern about handing over shares.\" McCafferty attended a meeting of the ERC shareholders in Dublin yesterday as one of the RFU's two delegates but left before the board met in the afternoon. \"I made a couple of proposals for the others to consider ... It would be wrong to say I am optimistic about Premiership clubs competing in Europe next season because we have reached the 11th hour. There is hope and the future of this great tournament should not hinge on whether we can agree a deal over player welfare with the RFU because that could take months.\" If the Premiership clubs were not party to the new accord the RFU would invite six First Division clubs to take their place but while the French Rugby Federation vowed to field teams in the absence of their leading sides, it is not sure where it stands legally on issuing invitations to its second division. Under French law the decision of a sporting body's president is binding. Last week the LNR president, Serge Blanco, refused to allow a vote to be taken by all its member clubs, which includes the French second division, after his board's decision to withdraw from Europe. A number of clubs and the FFR president Bernard Lapasset are exploring whether there is a way of overriding Blanco's edict that the ban is \"non-reversible\". LNR did not send a representative to Dublin yesterday If the French remain on the outside the FFR will field regional teams. Blanco last night broke his silence after being blamed at the start of the week by the International Rugby Board chairman Syd Millar for bringing the Heineken Cup to its knees. \"I have been defending the interests of clubs who have taken great risks in the last 10 years to increase their budgets ninefold and who today fear for their futures,\" said Blanco. \"The IRB ignores the clubs when they should be having dialogue with us over a number of issues. I find it tiring and you have the impertinence to talk to me about respect.\" Officials from the Six Nations will gather today and set a date for the next ERC board meeting when the teams taking part in next season's Heineken Cup will be decided. The European Challenge Cup will be mothballed on financial grounds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
