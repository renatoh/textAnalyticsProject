Almah also features pianist Nitai Hershkovits, drummer Ofri Nehemya, and the unique oboe and cor anglais improviser Yoram Lachish, alongside violin, violas and cello. Cohen's Song for My Brother unfolds in a rolling trance, pivoting on an emphatic bass break, On a Black Horse veers between wistful baroque symmetry and implacable string-group funk, and Thad Jones' A Child Is Born gains new resonances from the contrast between Lachish's plaintive reeds and Cohen's bass. There are gliding oboe lullabies, pounding Arab dances, and the hip-hoppish Shlosre is a fiendish rhythmic workout for the jazz trio at the core of this band. It's genre-blending music from a conventional melodist's angle, but made with a real sensitivity to its ingredients."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
