Fifa said on Monday that its lawyers were analysing the situation. However, insiders said the banner clearly broke the ruling body\u2019s rules on making political statements. The England players were told by the Football Association not to answer any questions concerning the banner \u2013 which read Las Malvinas son Argentinas (the Falklands are Ours). Meanwhile, it has emerged that the World Cup opener between Brazil and Croatia will take place without a proper test event that would meet UK safety requirements. The race to finish the Arena de S\u00e3o Paulo has meant that none of the three warm-up events \u2013 including a Brazilian league fixture and a clash between two Corinthians\u2019 junior sides \u2013 were held in front of a capacity crowd. In the UK the Green Guide to stadium safety states that to gain a licence test events must take place at 30%, 60% and full capacity before a safety certificate can be granted. One of the huge temporary stands at one end of the new stadium, which seats 20,000 people, has yet to be filled to capacity because the local fire department refused to approve it before the game between the two youth sides on Sunday night. Instead a machine has been used to stress-test the strength of the new stand. The finishing touches were still being put to the stadium this week before Thursday\u2019s opening match. A total of three workers died in the construction of the stadium, partly causing delays that left organisers facing a race against time to finish it in time for Thursday\u2019s match."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
