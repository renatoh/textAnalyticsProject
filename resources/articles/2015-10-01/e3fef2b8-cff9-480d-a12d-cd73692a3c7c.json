As recriminations grow over Fisher\u2019s appointment, Benn \u2013 who stood for Labour in Croydon South in May \u2013 has written to Labour\u2019s general secretary, Iain McNicol, saying that Fisher\u2019s previous behaviour \u201ccontradicts Labour party rules\u201d, which state that supporting a non-Labour candidate will lead to automatic expulsion. Her dramatic intervention is a severe embarrassment to Corbyn, who was a close friend and political ally of the late Tony Benn. It reflects deep dismay across much of the party at the Labour leader\u2019s choice of a hard-left and notoriously outspoken individual to fill such a key role in his inner circle. In the letter, sent on Friday and obtained by the Observer, Benn, who is also the niece of the shadow foreign secretary, Hilary Benn, cites a tweet that Fisher put out telling voters not to back her in Croydon South but to vote instead for the Class War candidate, Jon Bigger. The tweet from August last year, which has been deleted from Fisher\u2019s account, said: \u201cFFS if you live in Croydon South, vote with dignity, vote @campaignbeard.\u201d @Campaignbeard was Bigger\u2019s twitter account. Benn, who failed to take the safe Tory seat, says in the letter: \u201cI was the parliamentary candidate for Croydon South, having been democratically elected by the local party. Actively advocating voting against the official Labour candidate, in favour of another party, contradicts Labour party rules.\u201d Calling for Labour\u2019s national executive committee (NEC) to investigate, she cites the party\u2019s rule book, which says anyone who supports a candidate standing against the official Labour candidate \u201cshall automatically be ineligible to be or remain a party member\u201d. She adds: \u201cThe Labour party is a broad church. I welcome lively debate and robust challenge. However, as I\u2019m sure you will agree, there is a clear difference between this and the behaviour of Mr Fisher referenced above.\u201d Her move suggests the NEC could be heading for a tumultuous row over Fisher\u2019s continued membership of the party. Many Labour MPs are complaining at what they see as attempts to pack the ruling body with Corbyn loyalists. Members of the parliamentary party were outraged at the appointment, and to a lesser extent the choice of leftwing Guardian columnist Seumas Milne as the new director of communications. The appointment of Fisher was raised by former minister Caroline Flint at Monday\u2019s rowdy meeting of the parliamentary Labour party. On 8 May, the day after the general election, Fisher celebrated the defeat of Ed Balls, tweeting that it was \u201cfitting that the architect of Labour\u2019s miserable austerity-lite economic policies should lose #Balls\u201d. In September 2014, he described the Labour party\u2019s frontbench as \u201cthe most abject collection of complete shite\u201d. On Friday Lord Grabiner became the second peer to abandon Labour\u2019s benches in the House of Lords because of Corbyn\u2019s leadership of the party, saying \u201cI can\u2019t square [staying] with my conscience\u201d. He followed Lord Warner, who resigned the Labour whip five days earlier, saying Labour was no longer \u201ca credible party of government-in-waiting\u201d. Today Labour\u2019s former policy chief, Jon Cruddas, writing in the Observer attempts to chart a way forward for Labour while criticising the way it has allowed the Tory chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne, to claim the devolution agenda as his own. Cruddas, who announces the formation of a new grouping of MPs, party members and council leaders called Labour Together, says the party is \u201cstuck in an unpopular, outdated politics of taxing and spending and using state control\u201d which he says \u201chas got us into a situation in which a Tory chancellor looks more in tune with our Labour councils in the north than the Labour party itself\u201d. He applauds Corbyn for challenging the party to rethink \u201cthe way in which it does politics\u201d but says it has to develop a policy agenda that appeals to a wide cross-section of voters, while at the same time reclaiming the devolution agenda as its own. Shadow energy secretary Lisa Nandy, the Labour MP for Croydon North Steve Reed, and council leaders Judith Blake (Leeds) and Nick Forbes (Newcastle) will join the group."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
