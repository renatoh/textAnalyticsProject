Appleton described the players as \u201ccheesed off\u201d and \u201ca bit down in the dumps\u201d when they convened at the training ground for the first time since Shakespeare was sacked on Tuesday. The decision to relieve Shakespeare of his duties only four months into a three-year contract has been greeted with a mixture of surprise and disappointment inside the club, leaving the board facing a backlash from within. \u201cObviously the meeting before we went out to training was a little bit raw. People were disappointed and wanted questions answering, but I\u2019m not the person for that,\u201d said Appleton, who was Shakespeare\u2019s No2 and has been asked to take charge of the team while the club search for a permanent replacement. \u201cFrom my point of view it\u2019s all the questions that are for certain senior members and not myself. I didn\u2019t release Craig and I\u2019m not sure of the reasons why. If there\u2019s a million and one questions thrown at me today regarding \u2018why this?\u2019 and \u2018why that?\u2019 then you\u2019re probably asking the wrong person.\u201d Appleton would be open to the idea of one of the players acting as a representative for the rest of the first-team squad and speaking to the board in order to get the answers they are seeking, but for the moment he wants everyone\u2019s focus to be on Saturday\u2019s game at Swansea, where Leicester\u2019s owners are expected to be present. \u201cI\u2019m sure those conversations will certainly take place over the coming days,\u201d Appleton said. \u201cBut from my point of view, I\u2019d rather those conversations take place not going into the buildup of a game. Whether it\u2019s one of the senior players or not, the reality is we have got a massive game on Saturday, and come [Friday] I fully expect the focus to be on the game. And then if people want to raise those questions, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re more than happy to do that at a different date.\u201d Mindful of the mood among the players, Appleton took the view that it was best to \u201cchange the format\u201d of training by putting on a session that was more relaxed, and he felt the atmosphere lifted as a result. \u201cComing off the pitch, from lads who were a little bit cheesed off first thing and a bit down in the dumps in the meeting that we had, they actually came off with smiles on their faces because they enjoyed the session.\u201d Although Leicester are third from bottom with only six points from eight matches, Appleton said he had no inkling whatsoever that Shakespeare was under pressure and claimed that the \u201cfeeling within the camp is that there wasn\u2019t much wrong\u201d. The 41-year-old described Shakespeare as \u201cclearly shocked\u201d to lose his job, and said he personally has not been given any timescale for how long the club want him to act in a caretaker capacity. Sean Dyche, the Burnley manager, remains one of the frontrunners for the post and admitted he is flattered to be linked with the position. Dyche insisted, however, that there has been no approach from Leicester and said that his sole focus is on Saturday\u2019s match against Manchester City."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
