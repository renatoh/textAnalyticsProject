The rivers Tone and Parrett will be dredged where they meet, on a five-mile (8km) stretch. The first part to be dredged will be a 200-metre stretch of the Parrett, north of Coates Farm. This stretch has been identified by local people as being particularly silted up. Work should begin next month, provided the water drops to levels that make the operation safe. The news came as the Met Office confirmed the winter had been the wettest on record, with an average of 486.8mm of rain across the UK as a whole, exceeding the previous record of 485.1m set in 1995. The south-west of England and south Wales had 632.5mm of rain, substantially above the previous record of 610.7mm. The 492mm recorded in south-east and central England was far above the previous highest, 437.1mm, in 1915, when rain across northern Europe contributed to the massive casualties of the first world war. The Environment Agency and the government have come under severe pressure from local people to resume dredging, and senior Conservative politicians including the prime minister have backed the measure as a way of helping avoid future floods. But experts and the agency have long believed it is expensive and often ineffective, especially when it is not accompanied by wider measures that allow water to be absorbed in the landscape. It can also simply displace the problem of flooding. Dan Rogerson, floods minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), said: \"Today marks a crucial step forward in ensuring local communities around the Somerset Levels are better protected from the devastating impact of floods. We know those affected are tired and fed up but I can assure them we are working around the clock to clear the flood water so they can get on with their lives.\" He added that once the immediate emergency had passed he would be looking to draw up a plan for the area that could help to reduce flooding risk. A new plan from Defra and the Environment Agency will be presented by the government early next month. Paul Leinster, chief executive of the Environment Agency, said: \"We are committed to dredging as part of a broader package of work to protect people, property and land in Somerset.\" Defra said there were two severe flood warnings still in place on the Somerset Levels, with the largest ever pumping operation in England still under way. River levels were continuing to fall, including along the Thames and Severn. But the reduction in flood risk across affected areas may be slow because of an unsettled weather outlook. Groundwater levels are still rising in some areas as the effects of rainfall continue to be felt, and flood warnings are still in place across parts of southern and central England. Rain is forecast to spread across much of the country towards the end of the weekend. The army is still on hand to assist in the floods cleanup effort. Rail and road transport were still badly affected, Defra said. The Environment Agency said its plans to cut amounting to about 1,700 jobs would not affect its operations in flood remediation and prevention. The GMB union said the cuts would affect the agency's ability to respond to severe weather events. Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, said investment in flood defences would be a priority for an incoming Labour government and accused the coalition of \"short-termist salami-slicing\" of budgets for these. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Balls said: \"Of course, if Labour wins the next election, there will need to be spending cuts. There will be a big deficit still to be brought down after the global financial crisis and the chancellor [George Osborne] is set to break his promise to balance the books by 2015. \"But how we make those cuts is vital. Our zero-based review of public spending \u2013 a root-and-branch review of every pound spent by government from the bottom up \u2013 is clear that we must eliminate waste and inefficiencies, but also prioritise preventative spending that can save money in the long term. \"There can be few better examples than investment in flood defences.\" Spending on defences was boosted after the 2007 floods, but the coalition government then cut it by 17% in real terms in 2010, said Balls. \"Even after announcements in recent weeks, the House of Commons library says that government spending on flood defences is lower in real terms during this spending review period than the last one,\" he said. \"Meanwhile, there were over 300 shovel-ready flood-defence projects last year that could have been built but weren't due to lack of funding.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
