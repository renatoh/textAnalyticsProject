So let's round them up. \u2022 Fresh from having essentially told every Symbian developer in the world to give up and start writing for another platform on Friday, Nokia's chief executive Stephen Elop made his case for the changes again: \"We are creating a swing factor,\" he said. \"Wireless operators very much want a third ecosystem. They want customer choice and they want choices for themselves. And now they have that third choice.\" This is the same wilful refusal to accept that RIM is a viable contender that we've been hearing all week - which I'd suspect is going to have RIM's nose significantly out of joint. After all, GfK says that RIM's BlackBerry series was the biggest selling smartphone at retail in the UK for 2010. \"We are paying [Microsoft] for the software,\" Elop said. \"But we won't have to develop the software. And there will be some very apparent operating savings from doing this.\" Elop tried to allay those fears as he explained that Microsoft will contribute financial benefits to the company that total in the \"billions of dollars.\" So in essence it was the same line that he was spinning on Friday - which isn't surprising, since all there's been since then is the markets' reaction (bad), the employees' reaction (bad), the developers' reaction (bad among those Symbian developers still remaining outside Nokia) and the press reaction (mixed). Google called for disaffected developers to apply; so did HP. You can see that Microsoft might like the idea of being able to add location data from lots of phones, and Nokia might like the idea of cutting its costs while having a US-based ecosystem. Business Insider suggested that the benefits to Microsoft financially are very small - that even if you assumed Nokia keeps its smarpthone share, Microsoft only gets about $1.4bn in licensing revenue, which is peanuts by the standards of Windows and Office; on that basis it suggested that what Microsoft is trying to do is keep the enterprise. I don't think so - I think Microsoft has grander ambitions about cornering advertising and location-based services on phones, just like Google. There's going to be real antipathy between those two. \u2022 Samsung announced its Galaxy S II smartphone, with dual-core processor and which runs Android 2.3 (\"Gingerbread\") and includes its \"four content and entertainment hubs, for instant access to music, games, books, magazines and social networking services.\" Said Simon Stanford, managing director mobile for Samsung UK and Ireland: \"Following the huge success of our first Galaxy S handset last year, which sold in excess of 10 million units, we're aiming for its successor to become the ultimate smartphone.\" And it has a 4.27\" super AMOLED screen (active matrix organic light-emitting diode - basically, it's very bright but your battery lasts longer). \u2022 Samsung also announced the Galaxy Tab II tablet - and this is 10.1\" rather than 7\". It is, or will be, a dual-core machine running Android 3.0 (\"Honeycomb\") - the Android version devised for larger tablet screens, unlike, er, earlier Android versions such as you find on, um, the Galaxy Tab I. It will have a 1280x800 screen, 8MP rear-facing camera and 2MP front-facing camera, 16GB or 32GB models. Battery: 6860mAh capacity, though that's not an indication of life - and Samsung isn't making any claims about how long the battery will last. Vodafone customers will be first to get a go with it when it goes on sale \"in the spring\" (that's a suitably long period). Ah, and it also says that it \"builds on the industry-wide success of the two million-selling Samsung Galaxy Tab.\" So, no dealing with the question of how many of those \"sold\" were shipped to Antarctica. \u2022 Since we're talking tablets, my sources tell me that HTC is going to be introducing a 10.1\" tablet as well, also dual-core, also running Honeycomb. No dates, but it looks like it will also be sold through mobile networks. Separate rumours have been circulating that HTC is going to introduce a Facebook phone with a dedicated button - we'll have to see whether those pan out later this week. Last week (getting ahead of the rush?) INQ introduced a \"Facebook phone\" - though it isn't branded as such, as Tim Bradshaw of the FT noted in his report tying INQ and HTC into a \"Facebook phone\" that \"neither is branded [as that]... HTC's handset will have a dedicated button that takes users straight to Facebook, according to people familiar with the device.\" \u2022 Sony introduced its own Experia PlayStation phone, though from the opening description you'd think it was a compact camera: \"The Sony Ericsson Xperia\u2122 neo features a powerful 8.1 mega-pixel camera, a VGA front facing camera and HD video recording capability. Furthermore, Sony's award-winning Exmor R\u2122 for mobile sensor with the f/2.4 lens enables the capture of high quality, bright pictures and HD videos even in low light.\" And it makes phone calls too. Oo, and plays games too. Keith has blogged about it on the Games blog."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
