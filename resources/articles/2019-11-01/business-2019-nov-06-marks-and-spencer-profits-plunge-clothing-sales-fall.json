The chief executive, Steve Rowe, blamed the 5.5% decline in like-for-like clothing sales on buying errors that meant popular sizes sold out too quickly. A new design team was shedding its womenswear\u2019s reputation for \u201cfrumpiness\u201d, it said, but progress was undermined by the 135-year-old company\u2019s slow and complicated logistics, which meant it could not move products around the country fast enough. This setup contributed to a dire performance from its website, where sales were flat. Rowe conceded the numbers for the first half of its financial year were \u201cnot pretty\u201d. \u201cClothing is not where I wanted it to be,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are about 18 months behind and racing to make up lost time. My No 1 priority is to get under the bonnet of the clothing business.\u201d He pointed to the stronger performance delivered by M&amp;S\u2019s food halls, where the results of its \u201ctransformation\u201d programme were \u201cbeginning to show\u201d. The food business returned to growth over the period, with like-for-like sales up 0.9% in the six months to 28 September, thanks to a programme of price cuts and new ranges. Following almost two decades of attempts to revive the high street giant, Rowe and the retail veteran Archie Norman, who joined as chairman in 2017, are the latest management team to try to reinvent the retailer, which recently lost its place in the prestigious FTSE 100. Like Mothercare, which on Tuesday said it was closing down its loss-making UK chain, M&amp;S is facing an existential crisis as it struggles to compete with cheaper rivals such as Primark and the rise of online shopping. Jill McDonald was ousted as M&amp;S clothing boss in the summer after buying mistakes ahead of a jeans promotion left it with empty rails for a month. While maintaining its crown as the UK\u2019s largest clothing retailer, sales at the high street chain have now been falling for about eight years. Richard Lim, chief executive of consultancy firm Retail Economics, said M&amp;S\u2019s clothing ranges were \u201cconfused\u201d and had been missing the mark season after season: \u201cThe race is on to fix its broken business model,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sector is evolving at an unprecedented pace and some of the deep-rooted challenges in the business are proving extremely challenging to resolve.\u201d As part of its fightback plan, M&amp;S is closing 120 full-line stores, which sell clothing and food under one roof. It has struck a deal with Ocado, which will result in the online grocer carrying products from M&amp;S rather than Waitrose from next year. The contrasting fortunes of the food and clothing divisions have led to speculation that M&amp;S could break up. However, Norman \u2013 who made his name with the turnaround of Asda in the 1990s before selling it to Walmart \u2013 pointed out that most of the profit in both businesses was made in combined stores. \u201cThere are very strong sinews that join the businesses together that make the idea of taking the division too far today completely impractical,\u201d he said. In a bid to revitalise its clothing business, M&amp;S will cull the size of its range to focus the chain\u2019s massive buying power on a smaller number of potential blockbuster items. It is also changing the fit of its products in an attempt to attract younger customers. In menswear, for example, where shoppers complained that the clothes were \u201ctoo old\u201d, it has started to stock more slim and skinny-fit trousers. The shares, which have lost a third of their value over the past year, finished flat at 182p on the update, which showed a 17% decline in pre-tax profits (before one-off items) to \u00a3176.5m on sales of \u00a34.9bn. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to do, but I\u2019d like to think that yes, we\u2019ve seen a low point and the start of something different,\u201d said Rowe, when asked if M&amp;S had reached its nadir. The company also pointed to a recent spike in fashion sales, with full-price and planned promotional sales up 2.7% in October on a year ago. \u201cOne swallow does not a summer make \u2013 I\u2019ve certainly been here before \u2013 but I am encouraged by the reaction we have had,\u201d said Rowe. He said that M&amp;S was seeing dramatic sales uplifts when it managed to get the price, style and availability right \u2013 giving the example of jeans, where sales were up 34% in October compared with last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
