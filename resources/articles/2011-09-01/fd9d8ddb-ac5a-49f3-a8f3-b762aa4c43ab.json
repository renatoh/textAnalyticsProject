In the escalating battle between the countryside lobby and the government over a new national planning policy framework (NPPF), that should be a guiding principle as the number of households massively outstrips house-building. Aside from zealots opposed to any development, the case for better housing should be accepted by those understandably concerned by ministerial doublespeak \u2013 principally a commitment to \"sustainability\" and \"growth\" coupled with an inability to adequately explain either concept. No wonder there is a backlash from the shires, underpinned by the uncharacteristically robust campaign of the National Trust, reinforced by an outraged Daily Telegraph. And still the government piles confusion on to bewilderment. Those Tory faithful in open rebellion took David Cameron at his word when he promised that communities would be at the heart of what amounted to a new, micro-localist planning process, dismissed by critics as a charter for nimbyism. Then comes along the NPPF, pledging that \"at the heart of the planning system is a presumption in favour of economic development\". Turning this micro-localism on its head, it noted that application of this \"presumption\" would mean that communities and neighbourhood planning must conform to a wider (Treasury-inspired) agenda for growth. In desperation, Eric Pickles's beleaguered department for communities and local government has produced a dismal attempt at rebuttal seemingly at odds with its own NPPF. Unbelievably, it claimed that the framework \"puts local people in the driving seat of decision-making ... communities will have the power to decide the areas they wish to see developed\". Aside from this latest intervention, which raises serious questions about political competence, the case for a sensible debate on the urgent case for new and renewed housing must now be paramount, with building in England at its lowest level since 1924. The big house-builders, of course, want new housing at any price no matter how poorly designed, built and located \u2013 often miles from community facilities, bus routes and the social amenities that add to the vitality of urban neighbourhoods. So we have to plan new settlements, renewed neighbourhoods and urban extensions with the vision and determination of those pioneers in the garden city/suburb movement and post-1945 new towns. And yet, as the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba) points out, we have to do more. Its Case for Space report makes clear that many of our new homes are too small and poorly designed. The most common three-bed home should have 23% more space to meet the basic, recommended minimum size. Riba is about to launch a future homes commission examining the often lamentable state of our new housing. \"In the rush to build quickly, and cheaply, we risk storing up unnecessary problems for the future,\" says the institute's chief executive, Harry Rich. Pickles needlessly undermined construction last year by scrapping regional planning, but England not only needs to build more, it has to build better. The danger in the desperation to kickstart building is that the government will unleash a free-for-all. That could further fuel greater car dependency with poorly-designed housing estates miles from anywhere \u2013 at the expense of urban England. And our towns and cities outside of London certainly need a champion, a latter day Michael Heseltine, to aid regeneration and renewal \u2013 but that's almost another story.
