He said \u201cMy experience in government ends here \u2026 I did all I could to bring this to victory. Renzi has called a cabinet meeting for 1730 GMT, after which he said he would tender his resignation. The margin of the rejection\u2013 close to 20 percentage points \u2013 was much wider than expected. On a high turnout of 65.47%, 59.11% of voters chose no; 40.89% went for yes. Overseas voters bucked the trend, voting overwhelmingly (64.7%) for yes. The vote prompted the euro to initially fall to a 20-month low against the dollar and then bounce back to its highest level since mid-November. But shares in Italian banks have tumbled. Shares in the world\u2019s oldest bank - Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena - fell sharply. Concerns about MPS were raised during the stress tests on the sector by the European Banking Authority in July, when the bank was ranked as the weakest of the 51 European institutions subjected to the annual assessment. France\u2019s far right leader Marine Le Pen has welcomed the Italian referendum as an anti-austerity signal to France. She said: \u201cAfter the Greek referendum, after Brexit, this Italian No adds a new people to the list of those who would like to turn their backs on absurd European policies which are plunging the continent into poverty.\u201d Italy might have to spend public money to rescue some of its banks, according to European Central Bank governing council member Ewald Nowotny. \u201cThe difference between Italy and other states such as Germany and Austria is that, until now, in Italy there has not been any significant state aid or state takeovers (of banks),\u201d he said. Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, admitted that the result was a \u201cconcern\u2019. But finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, says Italy should continue with Renzi\u2019s economic policies. \u201cItaly has to continue the path that Prime Minister Renzi has taken economically and politically\u201d, he said. The referendum \u2013 which was on questions of constitutional reform not the euro or EU \u2013 was nonetheless seized upon by populist groups including the Five Star movement and the anti-immigration Northern League (Lega Nord), which called for snap elections. Matteo Salvini, head of Italy\u2019s far right Northern League party, has hailed the referendum result as Italy\u2019s \u2018liberation day\u2019 from the Renzi government. He said it sent a message to Europe. European commissioners and finance ministers put a brave face on the result. Pierre Moscovici, the European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, said he had \u201cfull confidence in Italian authorities to manage this situation\u201d. French Finance Minister Michel Sapin, said: \u201cThe referendum wasn\u2019t about Europe.\u201d Italy\u2019s president Sergio Mattarella is thought unlikely to call fresh elections but is instead expected to appoint a caretaker prime minister. Finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan, culture minister Dario Franceschini and Senate president Pietro Grasso are the names most commonly touted. Renzi has called a cabinet meeting for 1730 GMT, after which he said he would tender his resignation. Reuters looks at the possible contenders to succeed him and what happens next: Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan, who has pulled out of meetings with European finance ministers in Brussels this week, is viewed as a possible candidate to replace Renzi. Senate President Pietro Grasso and Transport Minister Graziano Delrio have also been tipped as possible successors. It is unclear if Renzi will have enough support in his Democratic Party (PD) to remain party leader - a role that could give him a say in who becomes the next prime minister. President Sergio Mattarella will consult with party leaders before naming a new prime minister - the fourth successive head of government to be appointed without an electoral mandate, a fact that underscores the fragility of Italy\u2019s political system. In the meantime, Renzi would stay on as caretaker. The new prime minister, who will need the backing of Renzi\u2019s PD to take office, will have to draw up a new electoral law, with the Five Star Movement urging a swift deal to open the way for elections in early 2017, a year ahead of schedule. \u201cFrom tomorrow, we will start work on putting together 5-Star\u2019s future programme and the team of people that will make up a future government,\u201d said Luigi Di Maio, tipped to be the group\u2019s prime ministerial candidate. Opinion polls put 5-Star neck-and-neck with the PD. Shares in Italian banks are significantly down notes analyst and commentator Ferdi Giugliano. Pier Carlo Padoan, Italy\u2019s finance minister and leading contender to replace Renzi, has told European finance leaders that Italy cannot make commitments for extra funds for the 2017 budget. He cited the \u201cpolitical situation\u201d in Italy, according Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the group of 19 countries that use the euro. Earlier Dijsselbloem said there is no need for \u201cemergency steps\u201d after Italian voters rejected constitutional reforms. He told reporters in Brussels that \u201cit doesn\u2019t really change the situation economically in Italy or in the Italian banks. It doesn\u2019t seem to require any emergency steps.\u201d Stephanie Kirchgaessner picks out some interesting variations in the way Italians living abroad voted out: Shares in the world\u2019s oldest bank - Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena - have fallen after the vote, writes the Guardian\u2019s city editor Jill Treanor. Investors in MPS, which was founded in 1472, fear the resignation of Matteo Renzi as prime minister will affect attempts to clinch a \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.2bn) lifeline from investors by the end of the year. The shares plunged 10% before recovering some losses. They were trading 3% lower at around midday in London. Concerns about MPS were raised during the stress tests on the sector by the European Banking Authority in July, when the bank was ranked as the weakest of the 51 European institutions subjected to the annual assessment. A consortium led by JP Morgan, the Wall Street investment bank, is reportedly meeting to discuss the fundraising. There were also reports that Monte dei Paschi bank officials will meet the Qatar Investment Authority \u2013 the gulf state\u2019s sovereign wealth fund \u2013 to try to secure backing from a key investor. Even so, there are expectations that the Italian government will need to prop up the bank, despite new EU rules which prevent state aid unless bondholders have been forced to take losses. Alberto Chiandetti, a manager at the Fidelity European Opportunities and Fidelity Funds Italy investment funds, said: \u201cThe focus is on whether an anchor investor will materialise or not. If not, Monte Paschi needs a plan B and in that scenario, bank shares are likely to suffer most. We should know [on Monday] whether such an anchor investor exists for Monte Paschi.\u201d The prospects of a capital injection for MPS being found entirely from private investors appeared to be receding, analysts said. \u201cI think a precautionary recapitalisation is ultimately still probable as a private sector-only solution is now highly unlikely to work,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director of Eurasia Group. Our former Paris correspondent Lizzy Davies has a better translation of Le Pen\u2019s reaction to the Italian referendum. Welcoming the \u201chuge No\u201d to Renzi\u2019s proposals, Le Pen said it was \u201ca No to the absurd policy of ultra-austerity which Matteo Renzi pursued, a policy wanted by the European Union and imposed on Italy.\u201d The \u201causterity purge\u201d in Italy had led to no economic gain, Le Pen claimed, using the referendum result to attack her opponents in France, particularly Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, the right\u2019s Thatcherite presidential candidate, who Le Pen said would like to \u201cspeed up\u201d austerity. She added: \u201cAfter the Greek referendum, after Brexit, this Italian No adds a new people to the list of those who would like to turn their backs on absurd European policies which are plunging the continent into poverty. More broadly - and the impressive growth of the [far-right] Freedom Party in Austria shows just this - the global rejection of all the European Union\u2019s policies, its economic and migration ones in particular, is speeding up on the continent. \u201cIt is time that France chose someone capable of being the leader of a Europe of nations and freedoms, able to coalesce the energy of all countries which reject an austerity-led, free trade-supporting and pro-immigration political model.\u201d Italy\u2019s former prime minister, Mario Monti, predicts there will be no early elections and that a new centre-left government will be formed and return Italy to a policy of fiscal tightening. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s World at One programme, Monti said: \u201cI do not believe there will be early elections. I\u2019m convinced that the president of the republic, in his wisdom, will find a solution within the space of the current political majority of the centre left.\u201d He said there was no need for alarm. \u201cIn the financial markets the reactions are considerably cooler than many feared,\u201d Monti said. He claimed that in the last 18 months, Renzi\u2019s government had relaxed fiscal policy a \u201cbit too much\u201d in the hope of winning the referendum. Monti, who backed a no vote, added: \u201cWith the distraction of the referendum over, there may well be a refocussing of economic policy on its core business which is not that of creating a favourable consensus.\u201d Monti said the no vote was not the result of populist sentiment. \u201cIt would be inappropriate to see this result as another victory for populism. Prime minister Renzi himself had played the populist card quite strongly from the top, particularly against the European Union.\u201d Monti argued the voters demonstrated maturity in rejecting money being transferred by the state to the banks. He also denied that the vote was a rejection of the euro. \u201cAmong the parties which recommended the no vote, there is the Five Star Movement and separately they say that if they were in majority government one day they would promote a referendum for Italy to go out of the euro. But I know so many people who voted no though being fervent pro-Europeans.\u201d Before the vote, Monti argued that there was no reason for Renzi to resign if he lost the referendum. But in his interview Monti said: \u201cthe negative outcome for him was so massive that I understand and respect his immediate [decision to] resign.\u201d France\u2019s far right leader Marine Le Pen has welcomed the Italy referendum and claims it boosts her chances of becoming France\u2019s next president. In a statement the Front National leader said the result was a signal to France. She claimed her key opponent in the presidential election Fran\u00e7ois Fillon backed Renzi and his austerity policies She said after Brexit and the Greek referendum, Italy was the latest country \u201cto turn its backs on absurd European policies that are plunging the continent into misery.\u201d She added: \u201cIt is time that France chooses a leader who can be the leader of free Europe of nations, able to unite the energy of all these countries in rejecting a political project based on austerity, free-market and immigration.\u201d Matteo Renzi is preparing to formally submit his resignation before Italy\u2019s president, writes Stephanie Kirchgaessner in her latest roundup from Rome. Renzi conceded shortly after midnight on Monday and is expected to head to the presidential palace, the Quirinale, on Monday afternoon. The anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the Northern League quickly sought to capitalise on Renzi\u2019s defeat and say they want snap elections, even before a planned reform of electoral laws is to go ahead. Luigi Di Maio, one of the M5S\u2019s rising stars, declared that the populist movement was ready to create the future government, while the xenophobic Northern League head, Matteo Salvini, said his fringe party \u2013 which has its roots in secessionism \u2013 ought to be considered a \u201cserious alternative\u201d. Salvini called the result \u2013 and the strong showing of the far right Austrian party in elections yesterday, which it ultimately lost \u2013 a clash of \u201call against one\u201d. Theres\u2019 no need to panic or hyperventilate argues analyst Vincenzo Scarpetta. In a blogpost for the Open Europe thinktank he writes: European politics is slightly more complex than dominos. What took place in Italy yesterday was neither a general election nor a referendum on the single currency. Either would likely be a different proposition. The \u2018No\u2019 camp was a very broad church. This makes me wary of describing the result simply as \u2018Renzi being brought down by the populist wave\u2019 \u2013 unless we want to describe Mario Monti or former Italian Constitutional Court President Valerio Onida (to mention but two examples) as populists for being against the reform. There was certainly an anti-establishment (and anti-Renzi) element involved, but one should also bear in mind that \u2013 beyond the headlines and the slogans \u2013 the proposed constitutional changes did raise some genuine issues and proved more controversial than many seem to appreciate. Undeniably, Renzi\u2019s resignation opens a period of greater political fluidity during which the reform process in Italy will slow down \u2013 and that will be regarded as bad news in Brussels, Berlin, and other European capitals. However, as I already wrote last week, the framework is completely different from late 2011 and there are simply too many unknowns at this stage to predict \u2013 as some are doing \u2013 that the next Italian general election will certainly open the door to an anti-euro government in the Eurozone\u2019s third-largest country. Here\u2019s a roundup of the latest on Italy\u2019s referendum and its aftermath: Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi has said he will resign on Monday after voters dismissed his plans for constitutional reform in a crushing referendum that saw close to 60% of voters opt for \u201cno\u201d. He said: \u201cMy experience in government ends here \u2026 I did all I could to bring this to victory. If you fight for an idea, you cannot lose.\u201d Though Renzi had been predicted to lose, the margin \u2013 close to 20 percentage points \u2013 was much wider than expected. On a high turnout of 65.47%, 59.11% of voters chose no; 40.89% went for yes. Overseas voters bucked the trend, voting overwhelmingly (64.7%) for yes. Renzi\u2019s departure \u2013 and the prospect of politically uncertain months ahead \u2013 prompted the euro to initially fall to a 20-month low against the dollar. But after early losses it bounced back to its highest level since mid-November after traders realised there was little prospect of Italy leaving the single currency. Italy might have to spend public money to rescue some of its banks, according to European Central Bank governing council member Ewald Nowotny. \u201cThe difference between Italy and other states such as Germany and Austria is that, until now, in Italy there has not been any significant state aid or state takeovers (of banks),\u201d he said. Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, admitted that the result was a \u201cconcern\u2019. But finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, says Italy should continue with Renzi\u2019s economic policies. \u201cItaly has to continue the path that Prime Minister Renzi has taken economically and politically\u201d, he said. The referendum \u2013 which was on questions of constitutional reform not the euro or EU \u2013 was nonetheless seized upon by populist groups including the Five Star movement and the anti-immigration Northern League (Lega Nord), which called for snap elections. Matteo Salvini, head of Italy\u2019s far right Northern League party, has hailed the referendum result as Italy\u2019s \u2018liberation day\u2019 from the Renzi government. He said it sent a message to Europe. European commissioners and finance ministers put a brave face on the result. Pierre Moscovici, the European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, said he had \u201cfull confidence in Italian authorities to manage this situation\u201d. French Finance Minister Michel Sapin, said: \u201cThe referendum wasn\u2019t about Europe.\u201d Italy\u2019s president Sergio Mattarella is thought unlikely to call fresh elections but is instead expected to appoint a caretaker prime minister. Finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan, culture minister Dario Franceschini and Senate president Pietro Grasso are the names most commonly touted. More brave faces have been put on Italy referendum\u2019s from the European establishment. The Markets expected Renzi to be defeated in the referendum so priced in the outcome, according to Reuters. But they were surprised by the scale of the defeat hence the initial fall in the value of the euro. Luigi Scazzieri, an analyst at the Centre for European Reform, argues that the vote is unlikely to lead of more instability in Europe. Writing for the Guardian\u2019s Opinion section he says: A new government would likely be made up of the same political majority currently supporting Renzi, with the possible addition of Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia party. It would face the same challenges and would continue to act in much the same way, steering the country towards new elections in late 2017 or 2018 and pursuing the stony path of incremental economic reform. Indeed, while Renzi sought to portray the reforms as a make or break moment for Italy, the economic reforms of the past five years are not about to be undone. A takeover by the populist Five Star Movement is unlikely either now or in the next election. The movement may run out of steam, as it increasingly becomes embroiled in political mishaps arising from its administration of Rome and Turin. Crucially, planned electoral reforms are likely to lead a form of proportional representation that will make it difficult for any single party to form a government. The continuation of coalition governments will exclude the Five Star Movement, which refuses to take part in them. And any new Italian government is likely to behave in the same way as Renzi\u2019s government did towards its European allies, seeking to bend fiscal rules in its favour and to press for a more expansive fiscal policy. It will also continue to demand solidarity from the EU with its efforts to deal with migrants and to rebuild the areas affected by recent earthquakes. Italy is unlikely to be the domino that leads to more instability in Europe. Paul Mason, Guardian columnist and author of Postcapitalism, is buoyed by the referendum result in Italy and the presidential election in Austria. Matteo Salvini, leader of Italy\u2019s far-right Northern League, says the result \u2013 alongside the \u201chair\u2019s breadth\u201d defeat of far-right Freedom party candidate Norbert Hofer in Austria \u2013 sends a message to the EU. Italy might have to spend public money to rescue some of its banks, including by taking stakes in them, according to European Central Bank governing council member Ewald Nowotny. \u201cThe difference between Italy and other states such as Germany and Austria is that, until now, in Italy there has not been any significant state aid or state takeovers (of banks),\u201d Reuters quoted him saying. Nowotny, who heads Austria\u2019s central bank, added: \u201cIt therefore cannot be ruled out that it will be necessary for the state to take stakes (in banks) in some way.\u201d Follow the latest market reaction here: BuzzFeed\u2019s Italian Europe editor Alberto Nardelli cautions against playing down the referendum result: Germany\u2019s foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier has admitted that the result of the Italian referendum is a \u201cconcern\u2019. He said that while the result of the Italian referendum on constitutional reform,was \u201cnot the end of the world,\u201d it was also \u201cnot a positive development in the case of the general crisis in Europe.\u201d Steinmeier said that Germany was watching the developments \u201cwith concern.\u201d He added that Renzi\u2019s government had been moving in the right direction, and he said Germany hoped the new Italian government would continue along the same path. What happens now in Italy? Our Rome correspondent Stephanie Kirchgaessner has the answers: Prime Minister Matto Renzi said at an emotional press conference after the vote that he would submit his resignation to Italy\u2019s president, Sergio Mattarella, on Monday afternoon. We can expect that the president will either accept his resignation or ask Renzi to stay, but the prime minister\u2019s overwhelming loss, with about 60% of Italians rejecting the proposed changes, mean he is most likely leaving Palazzo Chigi. For now. Then what? With Renzi gone it will fall to Mattarella to cobble together a new government. He will call in all the leading parties to see if they can reach an agreement on a new government. The major players will be Renzi, who is still the leader, for now, of the ruling Democratic party; Silvio Berlusconi, representing Forza Italia; Beppe Grillo or one of his emissaries \u2013 young guns Luigi Di Maio or Alessandro Di Battista; and Matteo Salvini of the Northern League. Hang on, won\u2019t there be an election? That\u2019s what the Five Star Movement and the Northern League want. They will put considerable pressure on Mattarella to dissolve the current parliament and set a date for a snap vote. If they appear to be in a hurry on this front, that\u2019s because they are, and for good reason. One of the major reforms that the Renzi government passed before Sunday\u2019s rout was an elaborate change to the country\u2019s electoral laws. The change was designed for the winner of the next election, which everyone thought would take place in 2018, to automatically take a majority of seats in parliament. At the time the so-called Italicum law passed, it was fiercely opposed by the Five Star Movement, which compared it to a fascist power grab. The changes in election rules were meant to work alongside the changes to the constitution that have now been rejected by Italian voters. The Democratic party has made it clear that it now wants to, and must, change the electoral law back to a proportional system. Not surprisingly, the Five Star Movement sees a big opportunity for the party to win if elections are held right now, under the new electoral laws, and before they are changed back to a proportionate system. This is the brutal fight we are heading into. Mattarella will have the final say. So will there be a snap election or not? Stay tuned. Most analysts do not think it is a real possibility, but there are a lot of moving parts at the moment. If the main centrist and traditional political parties \u2013 the Democratic party and Forza Italia \u2013 can stay aligned, because both have an interest in changing the electoral law back to the way it was, they can likely stave off calls for a snap election. In which case, who might be the next prime minister? Some names have been floating around for weeks, given that Renzi was behind in the polls for a while and Sunday\u2019s defeat was not really unexpected. The leading contender at the moment seems to be Pier Carlo Padoan, who currently serves as finance minister. It\u2019s a choice that might calm investor concerns, given that Padoan has long been seen as the lead figure in dealing with the aftermath of the economic crisis and continuing problems with Italy\u2019s banking system. Dario Franceschini, the culture minister, is another name that has been in the mix, as well as economic development minister Carlo Calenda, also famous for being at the centre of an unlikely row over prosecco with Boris Johnson. Federico Santi, an Italy analyst at Eurasia Group in London, said it was most likely that Renzi\u2019s replacement would be a member of the PD, and one who would be deemed acceptable to critical factions within the party as well as centrist coalition partners such as Angelo Alfano, the centre-right interior minister. But Renzi will also want to pick someone who does not necessarily harbour grand political ambitions themselves who might ultimately challenge him in the likely case that he wants to return to Palazzo Chigi in the future. What will the caretaker government do and how long will it take to get off the ground? Analysts predict that a caretaker government could be in place within a few weeks and that Renzi could remain at the helm of the government until a new government is secured with the backing of parliament and one other piece of impending business \u2013 passage of the 2017 budget \u2013 is completed. How has Mattarella handled crises like this in the past? We really don\u2019t know. This will be the first time the president, who was elected in 2015, has been at the centre of such a big moment for the country. He has been tight-lipped so far and is supposed to be an independent actor, making decisions in the best interests of Italy. Alessandra Mussolini, Italian Senator, Forza Italia MEP and the granddaughter of the dictator Benito Mussolini, says the Italian referendum result is ominous for German Chancellor Angela Merkel. She spells out the messages by retweeting a provocative image of Europe\u2019s fallen leaders posted by a right wing blogger. Matteo Salvini, head of Italy\u2019s far right Northern League party, has hailed the referendum result as Italy\u2019s Liberation Day from the government of Matteo Renzi. He is giving a press conference that is being streamed on Facebook. Pierre Moscovici, the European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, is putting a brave face on the Italian referendum. Speaking to reporters in Brussels he said he has \u201cfull confidence in Italian authorities to manage this situation\u201d. He added: \u201cI\u2019m very confident in the capacity of the eurozone to resist all kind of shocks.\u201d French Finance Minister Michel Sapin, took a similar move-along-nothing-to-see-here line. He insisted that the Italian referendum \u201cis a question of internal politics. The referendum wasn\u2019t about Europe.\u201d Since you\u2019re here, we have a small favour to ask. More people are reading the Guardian than ever \u2013 but far fewer are paying for it, and advertising revenues are falling fast. So you can see why we need to ask for your help. The Guardian\u2019s journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. But we do it because we believe that independent reporting and plurality of voices matter. If everyone who reads our reporting helps to pay for it, our future would be much more secure. Fund our journalism and keep the world informed. Support us with a monthly payment or a one-off contribution \u2013 Guardian HQ Germany\u2019s hardline finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, says Italy should continue with Renzi\u2019s economic policies. \u201cItaly has to continue the path that Prime Minister Renzi has taken economically and politically\u201d, Reuters quoted Sch\u00e4uble as saying. The response prompted a Gif of a headshaking Sch\u00e4uble: The euro has rebounded from a 21-month low, clawing back almost all the ground it had lost overnight. Reuters has more: The single currency tumbled as much as 1.4% in Asian trade to hit $1.0505, its weakest since March 2015, as investors worried about increased political uncertainty in the euro zone. But by 0855 GMT it had recovered almost all of those losses, trading down 0.1% on the day at $1.0650. The result had been widely expected, though the size of the \u201cNo\u201d vote, at with 59.1%, was more emphatic than had been forecast. \u201cBecause the vote was largely expected, there really isn\u2019t enthusiasm to push the move too far,\u201d said Societe Generale macro strategist Kit Juckes. \u201cFrom here, FX will take its cue from (bond) spreads, the equity market reaction, and wait for rating agencies to opine.\u201d Italy\u2019s 10-year government bond yield shot up as much 13 basis points to above 2% soon after European bond markets opened, still below a 14-month high around 2.17% touched in late November. By 0855 GMT it was back below 2%, up 6 basis points on the day. European Central Bank sources told Reuters last week that the bank was ready to step up purchases of Italian government bonds temporarily if the referendum result were to spur a sell-off, but traders said on Monday that they had seen no evidence of the ECB in the market so far. The ECB holds its next policy meeting on Thursday. \u201c(The result) has marginally increased the likelihood of a crisis like in 2011 or something, but even a full-blown crisis ... is not in itself something that is a meaningful burden for the euro,\u201d said Commerzbank\u2019s head of currency strategy in Frankfurt, Ulrich Leuchtmann, referring to the spiralling of Italian borrowing costs five years ago. \u201cThe only thing that would be a big burden (for the euro) is if the ECB reacts to it with more expansionary monetary policy, but ... Italian government bond spreads have reacted relatively benignly at the moment, and therefore it\u2019s relatively unlikely that the ECB will do anything big.\u201d Some analysts said the euro was drawing some support from Sunday\u2019s presidential election in Austria, where voters roundly rejected Norbert Hofer, the candidate vying to become the first freely elected far-right head of state in Europe since World War Two. Our Business Live blog has the latest: Lee Hardman, currency analyst as the Japanese finacial service company MUFG, says the relatively mild reaction on the markets reflects the irony that a no vote actually limits the risk of anti establishment parties gaining power in Italy. He said: \u201cBy rejecting the constitutional reforms, the Senate will retain it powers acting as a counter balance to the Chamber of Deputies. \u201cThe system of checks and balances reduces the risk of an anti-establishment party like the Five Star Movement gaining power and being able to call a referendum on the euro. \u201cThe current updated electoral law, which favours majorities in the Chamber of Deputies but is based on more proportional rules in the Senate, also makes it difficult for the Five Star Movement to govern by favouring political fragmentation. \u201cThe award of a majority premium of seats to the most popular party in the Chamber of Deputies will be challenged in court, and the law is likely to be changed under a potential caretaker government to make it favour more the formation of coalitions rather than one party rule which would make it even more difficult for the Five Star Movement to govern. \u201cThe difficulty the Five Star Movement faces in coming into power is one of the reasons why the negative euro reaction has been more modest than some have feared.\u201d Leading Ukippers are in a jubilant mood. But Brexit-backing Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan predicts that Italy won\u2019t be leaving the Euro. Daniele Caprera, the UK spokesman for the Five Star Movement (M5S), has repeated his party\u2019s opposition to Italy\u2019s membership of the Euro. He was asked on the BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme if the M5S would hold a referendum on Euro membership if it gained power. He said: \u201cThe Euro is a problem for Italy right now and we would like to get people\u2019s voice on that. The Euro is damaging the Italian economy and Euro isn\u2019t good enough for Italy right now.\u201d He dismissed talk of a global populist wave sweeping governments power as a \u201cmedia agenda\u201d, adding \u201cthis is mostly an Italian problem\u201d. Caprera added: \u201cThere is already a crisis in the EU. The current European system doesn\u2019t meet the European people\u2019s needs. It is more of economic system. It doesn\u2019t help socially any of the problems that there are in Europe with immigration, and financial problems. Europe right now is being used to bring in cheap labour, to lower everybody\u2019s salary. It is not a very good system.\u201d Asked if M5S was on the brink of power, Capera said: \u201cI think so. We are very credible. We want to change Italy. We want to participate in Europe but we need somebody who will listen. So far they have failed ... All they have been focused on is economics and austerity.\u201d Sandro Gozi, Italy\u2019s secretary for European affairs, says the project of European unity has lots a key player following the resignation of Matteo Renzi. Interviewed on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme Gozi was asked whether the no vote represented the beginning of Europe breaking apart as he warned before the vote. He said: \u201cThe beginning of Europe\u2019s disintegration started with Brexit and it is up to the other 27 governments to relaunch Europe. That was our policy, that was our goal as the Renzi government. It is clear that Europe now loses a major political actor to its relaunch.\u201d Gozi accepted the referendum result will lead to political instability in Italy, but not financial uncertainty. He said he did not see any risk to financial stability, but added there were \u201cbig questions\u201d now over the reform project in Italy. Gozi said: \u201cIt is clear that it was reformers against us: conservative camps, which was a mixture of has beens, many former prime ministers and the populists from the extreme right of the Northern League and the Five Star Movement. He added: \u201cIt is clear that politically we are in a period of uncertainty. And it clear that the coalition of \u2018no\u2019 is coalition of resistance to political change. This is the big question on which we have to work in next days and months.\u201d Our Rome correspondent Stephanie Kirchgaessner warns against over interpreting the results from a binary choice. She points out that many of those who voted no are also bitterly opposed to the far right Northern League and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement. Follow the jittery reaction in the markets on the Guardian\u2019s business blog. Has Renzi become the latest victim of the global rise in populism? Leading analysts differ. Richard Haas, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, says the result is ominous for western democracies and shows the current difficulty of governing from the centre. But FT editor, Lionel Barber, advices against generalising from the result pointing to the particular problems facing Italy. Leave.EU, the pro-Brexit campaign funded by former Ukip donor Arron Banks, has welcomed the Italy referendum result and hopes it will lead to Italy leaving the Euro. French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, says he respects the decision of Matteo Renzi to resign. In one of the first reactions from a fellow world leader, Hollande paid tribute to Renzi\u2019s courage and dynamism. Hollande, who last week announced he would not be contesting next year\u2019s presidential race in France, said he shares Renzi\u2019s desire to steer Europe towards jobs and growth. In a statement from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace he said he hoped Italy could rebound from the current situation. What eurozone crisis? asks Politico Europe as it urges its readers to stay calm. In its daily Brussels Playbook briefing it says all the talk of crisis is just talk ... for now: It\u2019s nearly impossible for a solvent country to leave the euro, and the number of savers with more than \u20ac100,000 in fragile banks is very small indeed. While the euro dipped (before rallying) to $1.05 when No emerged victorious, it borders on voodoo-economics to equate small currency movements with fundamental economic strength or weakness. Reality check: Italians voted to reject change. Leaving the eurozone is the biggest change imaginable and wasn\u2019t on the ballot. Renzi\u2019s resignation is no earthquake: Italy will have its 65th government since 1945 \u2014 it\u2019ll likely manage. Not that the future looks pretty: The country\u2019s inability to reform and move forward has seen it grow at an average of just 0.6 percent each year since 1960. Analysis from Stefano Stefanini: The former diplomat and current La Stampa columnist advises Playbook readers that while Europe is concerned about Italy this morning, Italy is anxious about the post-Renzi government, not the euro. In the medium term, Italy now joins France at the top of the list of 2017 electoral worries. That doesn\u2019t leave Angela Merkel in the clear: she\u2019ll be called upon to help save the EU by helping to save Italy\u2019s political centre. Italy Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi has said he will resign on Monday after voters dismissed his plans for constitutional reform in a crushing referendum that saw close to 60% of voters opt for \u201cno\u201d: My experience in government ends here \u2026 I did all I could to bring this to victory. If you fight for an idea, you cannot lose. Though Renzi had been predicted to lose, the margin \u2013 close to 20 percentage points \u2013 was much wider than expected. On a high turnout of 65.47%, 59.11% of voters chose no; 40.89% went for yes. Overseas voters bucked the trend, voting overwhelmingly (64.7%) for yes. Renzi\u2019s departure \u2013 and the prospect of politically uncertain months ahead \u2013 prompted the euro to fall to a 20-month low against the dollar. The referendum \u2013 which was on questions of constitutional reform not the euro or EU \u2013 was nonetheless seized upon by populist groups including the Five Star movement and the anti-immigration Northern League (Lega Nord), which called for snap elections. Matteo Salvini, leader of the Northern League, bracketed the result with Donald Trump\u2019s win in the US, Vladimir Putin, and support for France\u2019s far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen. Italy\u2019s president Sergio Mattarella is thought unlikely to call fresh elections but is instead expected to appoint a caretaker prime minister. Finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan, culture minister Dario Franceschini and Senate president Pietro Grasso are the names most commonly touted. Austria Far-right Freedom party candidate Norbert Hofer was beaten in the presidential election re-run by Green-turned-independent Alexander Van der Bellen. Hofer conceded after early results showed Van der Bellen ahead on 53.3%. The new president-elect said the result was a \u201csignal of hope and change to all the capitals in Europe\u201d; with Green politician Werner Kogler hailing it as a small global turning of the tide in these uncertain, not to say hysterical and even stupid times. Hofer called the intervention of former Ukip leader Nigel Farage \u2013 who had claimed the far-right candidate would call a Brexit-style referendum for Austria to leave the EU \u2013 a \u201ccrass misjudgment\u201d: It doesn\u2019t fill me with joy when someone meddles from outside. Meanwhile French prime minister Manuel Valls is expected to announce on Monday that he is seeking the Socialist party candidacy for president, after Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s decision not to stand for another term. Valls\u2019 office confirmed he will speak at 6.30pm (5.30pm GMT) \u2013 but it\u2019s not clear whether he will resign as prime minister in order to campaign. And to round off leader resignation news, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, John Key, also \u2013 unexpectedly \u2013 resigned on Monday. Italy\u2019s Sky TG24, citing pollsters Quorum, says younger voters opted overwhelmingly for no, by 81% to 19% among 18- to 34-year-olds. For the 35-54 age group, 67% chose no, with 33% ticking yes. It was only among the 55+ voters that a majority went for yes, by 53% to 47%. All votes \u2013 from within Italy and overseas ballots \u2013 have now been counted. The final result is: YES 40.89% NO 59.11% Turnout was 65.47%. The office of French president Manuel Valls has issued a statement confirming he will make a statement at 6.30pm (5.30pm GMT) but giving no further details. It\u2019s widely expected that he will announce he is seeking the Socialist candidacy for next year\u2019s presidential election \u2013 and could step down as PM to do so. In other European leader news, French prime minister Manuel Valls is expected to announce a bid for the presidency today, media there are reporting. The move has been anticipated since Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s announcement that he would not seek a second term as president. It\u2019s possible that Valls will resign as prime minister to focus on campaigning for the Socialist party\u2019s primary vote at the end of January. An announcement is expected at 6.30pm Monday, French media are saying. Italy Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi has said he will resign on Monday after voters dismissed his plans for constitutional reform in a crushing referendum that saw close to 60% of voters opt for \u201cno\u201d: My experience in government ends here \u2026 I did all I could to bring this to victory. If you fight for an idea, you cannot lose. Renzi\u2019s departure \u2013 and the prospect of politically uncertain months ahead \u2013 prompted the euro to fall to a 20-month low against the dollar.

And in completely unrelated news New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, John Key, has also \u2013 unexpectedly \u2013 resigned. There are three options for what happens next for Italy\u2019s government, AFP reports \u2013 one more likely than the others: 1: Renzi stays in power Theoretically Matteo Renzi could win a vote of confidence in parliament, either with his current majority or with a new one including Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s centre-right Forza Italia. But during his press conference, Renzi seemed to exclude this possibility. \u201cMy experience of government finishes here,\u201d he said. The crushing victory for the \u2018no\u2019 camp makes the return of Renzi a very distant possibility. 2: Technocratic government This is the most likely scenario. President Sergio Mattarella can appoint a head of government with the support of the current majority or a new enlarged majority. A number of names are already circulating, including finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan and senate leader Pietro Grasso. The caretaker government would be tasked with passing the 2017 budget in parliament and modifying a new electoral law before elections take place. He or she could also decide to continue until the end of the current parliamentary term in February 2018. 3: Immediate dissolution of parliament This is highly unlikely. A recent electoral reform was designed to ensure the leading party has a parliamentary majority in the chamber of deputies, while the failure of the constitutional reform of the senate means it still maintains a proportional system, making the two chambers irreconcilable and a parliamentary majority almost impossible. The populist Five Star movement, whose founder and leader Beppe Grillo has called for an election \u201cwithin a week\u201d, believes the electoral law could be modified in the senate if necessary to align it more closely with that of the chamber of deputies. But most other political parties, who have a majority in parliament, disagree, precisely to avoid a victory of the populist party. They are instead advocating reform of the electoral law. Alexander Van der Bellen, the man who narrowly saw off a far-right challenge to become \u2013 albeit largely by default \u2013 the first Green head of state in western Europe, is a tall, austere 72-year-old retired economics professor who has often called himself \u201ca child of refugees\u201d. A Green MP for 18 years before leaving parliament in 2012 to become a popular Vienna city councillor, Van der Bellen ran as an independent \u2013 although his campaign, which benefited from broad support particularly on the centre-left aimed at keeping out his nationalist rival \u2013 was backed financially by the Greens. Having consistently scored more highly than the party, he resigned his membership on Monday, saying the president needed to be above party politics. Viewed by many conservatives as too leftwing, and by more militant Greens as not radical enough, Van der Bellen spent the early part of his political career in the Social Democrats and even flirted briefly with Freemasonry. A schoolmasterly, sometimes even hectoring, campaigner known as Sascha in reference to his Russian roots, he led the Greens from 1997 to 2008, turning the party into the country\u2019s fourth biggest political force and stepping down only after elections in which it lost votes for the first time in a decade. A heavy smoker \u2013 \u201cI once quit for four months \u2026 but why should I torture myself at my age?\u201d \u2013 and outspoken supporter of gay marriage, the divorced and recently remarried father of two collected more than 4,000 signatures from Austrian public figures and celebrities during his presidential campaign. Van der Bellen\u2019s father was born in Russia to a family descended from Dutch immigrants. His mother was born in Estonia, from where both fled when the Red Army invaded in 1940, moving first to Germany and eventually settling in Austria. Aware of the need to appeal to voters a long way outside the party\u2019s normal base, Van der Bellen, who lists 19th-century Russian literature and Donald Duck cartoons among his interests, has not shied away from espousing a few traditionalist traits. His campaign videos have featured some unabashed yodelling, his speeches have often referred to the attachment he feels to his Tyrolean Heimat (homeland), and he has repeatedly stressed the social duties and obligation to integrate of Austria\u2019s 90,000 newly arrived refugees. La Repubblica goes with: \u201cNo wins, Renzi leaves.\u201d Il Tempo probably needs no translation: And neither does Il Manifesto: Regional newspapers L\u2019Alto Adige and Trentino have the referendum sweeping Renzi out: One constituency that has overwhelmingly voted \u2018yes\u2019 in Italy\u2019s referendum? Overseas voters. With most of the overseas ballots now counted, yes leads no by 64.92% to 35.08%. You can see a country-by-country breakdown here. For more on why the referendum could be bad news for the Italian economy, specifically the banking sector, there\u2019s a good explainer here courtesy of Wolf Richter on his blog, Wolf Street. To summarise, the country\u2019s banks have bad debts of \u20ac286bn sitting on their books. Somehow this situation needs to be dealt with, but the can has been kicked down the road continually in recent years. One reason is that for the debts to be written off, it means a massive hit for junior bondholders, many of whom are ordinary Italians who were tempted into buying dud bank debt. The problem is particularly acute for the third largest bank, Monte dei Paschi, which needs a \u20ac5bn recapitalisation. But thanks to the referendum, borrowing costs are rising, making it very expensive to get that capital into the bank, which has already gone through two failed rescues. As Richter writes: The already complex \u2013 and ultimately very costly \u2013 task of dealing with Italy\u2019s zombie banks, after years of brushing toxic waste under the rug, has become vastly more complex in the absence of a government with a mandate. Instability and uncertainty are likely to ricochet from Italy\u2019s banking crisis to the eurozone and its teetering banks, and beyond. \u201cI lost and I say it loud and clear, even if I have a lump in my throat,\u201d Italy\u2019s prime minister Matteo Renzi said in a late-night press conference. \u201cTomorrow afternoon I will call a cabinet meeting \u2026 I will then go to the Quirinale where I will tender my resignation to the president.\u201d With all the votes counted within Italy (counting of overseas ballots is not yet complete, and those tend towards yes, so the percentage might shift a little, but won\u2019t change the outcome), here\u2019s how the result stands, on a turnout of 68.48%: YES 40.74% NO 59.26% A thumping defeat for Renzi. Nigel Farage\u2019s dabbling in Austria\u2019s election has earned him a rebuke from the party he had backed to win the presidency. The former Ukip leader had claimed far-right candidate Norbert Hofer would call a Brexit-style referendum for Austria to leave the EU \u2013 something the candidate himself had explicitly ruled out: It is not something I want. We need to build a stronger union. Farage also told Fox News host Sean Hannity last week: I would put my money on the Freedom party\u2019s Mr Hofer winning that election. Hofer lost the vote to former Greens leader turned independent Alexander Van der Bellen, and labelled Farage\u2019s comments a \u201ccrass misjudgment\u201d, adding: It doesn\u2019t fill me with joy when someone meddles from outside. After the results became clear on Sunday night, Anton Mahdalik, a Freedom party member of Vienna city council, also criticised Farage\u2019s referendum claim: That didn\u2019t help us, it hindered us. One name in the frame as a potential successor to Matteo Renzi in Italy is Pier Carlo Padoan, currently the country\u2019s finance minister. Asked on Friday about his future plans, Padoan told Italy\u2019s Sky TG24: Of course, it will be up to the new government \u2013 if there will be a new one, which I don\u2019t think will be the case \u2013 to decide its composition. The culture minister, Dario Franceschini, and Pietro Grasso \u2013 current Senate president, and briefly acting president of Italy until Sergio Mattarella\u2019s swearing-in \u2013 have also been touted as possible caretaker leaders. It will be up to Mattarella to appoint a new prime minister once Renzi formally submits his resignation on Monday. It will be hard, as the dust settles, to escape the Brexit prism through which many across Europe will view the Italian vote. But what was the referendum actually about? Stephanie Kirchgaessner explains: The reforms, which would have affected a third of the Italian constitution, had already been approved by parliament but by a slim margin, thus requiring that they also be passed by referendum. Under the current system, which was created under Italy\u2019s 1948 constitution, there are two chambers of parliament with directly elected lawmakers, the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Both chambers have equal power \u2013 it\u2019s known as \u201cperfect bicameralism\u201d \u2013 and both must agree on legislation before it is passed. This means, put simply, that it can take a very long time for things to get done. For example, a law to give children born out of wedlock the same rights as children of married couples took nearly 1,300 days to be approved. Under the proposed reforms, the Senate would have lost almost all its power \u2013 the number of senators would have been reduced from 315 to 100, and the remaining senators would no longer be elected directly. Instead, the 100 would have been made up of lawmakers selected by regional assemblies. Some mayors would also serve as senators. That would have meant that most laws could be passed, including Italy\u2019s budget, by the Chamber of Deputies without consulting the Senate. The Senate would only have had the power to weigh in on big issues such as other constitutional reforms and the ratification of EU treaties. Some, but not all, constitutional experts believed the changes were essentially a power grab that would have made Renzi, or whoever was sitting in Palazzo Chigi, much more powerful. They argued that the changes would obliterate the delicate balance of power that was designed in 1948 by people who had witnessed the rise of fascism. All of Renzi\u2019s political opponents on the left and the right were aligned against the constitutional reforms, in large part because they wanted to force his resignation. With 98% of votes tallied in Italy, it does look as if the \u2018no\u2019 vote is holding on to its near-20 percentage point lead, heading \u2018yes\u2019 by 59.61% to 40.39%. Interestingly, as the Sky News tweet notes, \u2018yes\u2019 votes were in the majority among overseas voters \u2013 according to this official count by 65.2% to 34.7% so far \u2013 and in three Italian regions: Trentino-Alto Adige, Emilia-Romagna (by a whisker) and Tuscany. Market reaction to the Italian referendum result has been muted by comparison with the ups and downs in the hours and days after the Brexit and Trump votes. Shares are down across most Asian markets: Nikkei in Japan down 0.4% ASX/S&amp;P200 down 0.86% Hong Kong down 0.06%. In futures trading, the FTSE100 is expected to dip 0.68% at the open while the Dow Jones average on Wall Street is set to fall 0.18%. The euro has slipped to a 20-month low of 1.0575 against the US dollar. However, most reaction seems to agree that the biggest issue is the future of Italy\u2019s fragile banking system. The referendum was meant to smooth this week\u2019s intended refinancing of Monte dei Paschi, Italy\u2019s third-largest bank, which needs to raise an extra \u20ac5bn in capital and sell off \u20ac28bn of bad loans. But the political uncertainty set off by the referendum result will make it more difficult to secure that funding and condemn Italy\u2019s already moribund economy to more months of stagnation. Minori Uchida, chief currency analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in Tokyo, told Reuters: The \u2018no\u2019 vote was priced in to a certain extent in advance. So I do not expect a freefall in the euro in the near term. But in the long run, this will delay progress in Italy\u2019s efforts to get rid of banks\u2019 bad debt and is likely to widen the yield spread of German [and Italian bonds]. Working out what the message voters wanted to send in Italy will not be straightforward, Stephanie Kirchgaessner reports from Rome: It was clear from the high voter turnout \u2013 68% of eligible voters cast ballots on Sunday \u2013 that Italians were indeed sending a message to the political establishment in Rome. But deciphering that message will not be easy, despite celebratory claims from Europe\u2019s far right. Italy is facing a number of big issues that were not technically on the ballot: a migration crisis in which the country feels abandoned by Europe; an unresolved banking crisis; steep unemployment and a debt load of 132% of GDP with no solution in sight. The fact is that Renzi\u2019s defeat was almost a foregone conclusion give the scale of the opposition he faced, and not just from Northern League leader Matteo Salvini and Beppe Grillo, the bombastic former comedian and head of the Five Star Movement. But even from within the Democratic party and leftwing voters who defied the prime minister for a whole host of reasons, including a former prime minister, Mario Monti. While Salvini and M5S officials have touted the win as a major victory for their causes \u2013 they are not totally aligned but are vehemently opposed to the euro and the EU generally \u2013 it is clear that many Italians who voted no would not necessarily support either party in a general election. Indeed, some were indifferent to Renzi\u2019s fate but believed the rise of populism made proposed changes to the constitution especially dangerous. While defeat for Renzi\u2019s proposal was not unexpected in Italy, the size of the \u2018no\u2019 victory has exceeded most predictions. As the Financial Times\u2019 bureau chief in Rome notes: The current tally has \u2018yes\u2019 on 40.28%; \u2018no\u2019 on 59.72%. Monday\u2019s Guardian front page leads on news from Italy and Renzi\u2019s departure: After a tumultuous night in Italy, Matteo Renzi will on Monday head to the Quirinal palace to submit his resignation to president Sergio Mattarella. It is 14 months until the next elections are due, and it\u2019s expected that Mattarella will attempt to pull together a caretaker prime minister \u2013 likely from from Renzi\u2019s Democratic party \u2013 to serve until the February 2018 vote. The populist Five Star Movement and the anti-immigrant Northern League want early elections \u2013 but have no power to make that happen. Forza Italia, the right-wing party led by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi (yes, him), is less keen on a snap poll, Buzzfeed\u2019s Alberto Nardelli says: We are closer to a final result in Italy and the no vote is holding steady at around 59%. With 90.8% of precincts reporting: YES 40.3% NO 59.7% Italy is not voting to leave the eurozone or the EU. But there could still be far-reaching implications. Renzi came into power promising to be a reformer, to drag Italy \u201cout of the swamp\u201d and build a strong centre-left majority, so his loss is a big blow to people who think his defeat is a rejection of his agenda. It will also be seen, much like Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, as a victory of populist forces over an establishment party, although the reality is more complicated. A new caretaker government will probably take over and new elections could be held as soon as next year. One reason some observers think this vote is such a big deal is because it could open the door to the election of the Five Star Movement (M5S), a populist, anti-establishment party that has said in the past it wants to call a referendum on membership of the euro. But even if the M5S took over Palazzo Chigi, the prime minister\u2019s residence, it would not mean Italy abandoning the euro anytime soon. Doing that would require a constitutional amendment and another referendum. Euroscepticism is definitely on the rise in Italy, but there is no overwhelming political consensus against the single currency right now. The victor in Austria\u2019s presidential election, Alexander Van der Bellen, said his victory has sent \u201ca red and white signal of hope to all the capitals of the European Union\u201d, as he pledged to be a president for all Austrians, whether they had voted for him or against him. On that note, Reuters has this latest on market reaction to the vote in Italy and news of Renzi\u2019s imminent departure: US equity index futures fell after a stinging defeat for Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi, who said he would resign following a referendum over his proposals for constitutional reform. Exit polls and early projections on Sunday showed Renzi lost the referendum by a wide margin. \u201cBuy bonds and sell stocks,\u201d hedge fund investor Douglas Kass, who runs Seabreeze Partners Management Inc, said after the vote. \u201cThe technicals and fundamentals and political/geopolitical considerations are all souring.\u201d S&amp;P 500 e-mini futures were down 0.3% shortly after electronic trading resumed on Sunday evening \u2013 paring some losses after initially falling 0.5% \u2013 signalling Wall Street could start the week on a shakier footing after stumbling last week for the first time since the 8 November US election. Last week, the S&amp;P 500 shed 1%. Major Wall Street indexes had previously hit a series of record highs over the past three weeks following Republican Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential election, as investors rotated into sectors expected to benefit from campaign promises of tax cuts, infrastructure spending and bank deregulation. The referendum result in Italy has prompted a drop for the euro \u2013 but not a Brexit-style lurch: With 73.7% of precincts declared: YES 40.6% NO 59.4% And Beppe Grillo, founder of Italy\u2019s populist Five Star Movement, has called, via his blog, for an early election \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. A snap election is by no means certain, of course. Back to Italy, where Virginia Raggi, the mayor of Rome and a member of the Five Star Movement, has tweeted her approval of the referendum result: Italians have won. Now we rebuild the country. Our revolution does not end, in Rome and in Italy. While we\u2019re on the subject of prime ministerial resignations, here\u2019s another: John Key, prime minister of New Zealand, has just announced he will step down within a week. You can catch up on that news here: This is Claire Phipps picking up the live blog from Jon Henley, with continuing live coverage as Italy reels from the resignation of prime minister Matteo Renzi. We\u2019ll also have fallout from the result in Austria, where Alexander Van der Bellen has defeated far-right candidate Norbert Hofer for the presidency. Here is what Stephanie Kirchgaessner, the Guardian\u2019s Rome correspondent, said earlier about what was likely to happen next after the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, hands in his promised resignation on Monday: It will fall to President Mattarella to try to cobble together a new government with the agreement of the country\u2019s largest parties, including Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s conservative Forza Italia. The young guns of the Five Star Movement, including Luigi di Maio, made clear last week that they would call for a swift election if the No camp was victorious. But while some see the potential rise of either the M5S or the Northern League \u2013 which are both anti-EU \u2013 as a sign that Italy could try to pull out of the single market, some analysts have downplayed that possibility. An exit from the euro would be exceedingly complicated and \u2013 while Euroscepticism is clearly on the rise \u2013 there is no clear political consensus to leave the single currency. Wolfango Piccoli, an analyst at Teneo Intelligence in London, said the most likely outcome would be for Renzi to resign and a new caretaker government to take over. The new government would then be expected to focus entirely on the passage of a new electoral law, which in turn would hamper the ability of either the M5S or the Northern League from winning a strong majority in the next elections. A much-needed note of calm from the BBC\u2019s Gabriel Gatehouse. This referendum defeat does not necessarily mean snap elections, still less Italy exiting the euro: Following what looks set to be a heavy defeat in his referendum on constitutional reforms, Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi confirms \u2013 as he promised \u2013 that he will resign. \u201cI have lost and I say it out loud,\u201d Renzi told a news conference, adding that he would submit his resignation on Monday. Addressing the nation live on television from the Palazzo Chigi, Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi concedes and says he \u201ctakes full responsibility\u201d for the heavy referendum defeat. Although, as this tweet notes, \u201cI\u2019m coming\u201d is what Renzi tweeted when he took office. So perhaps we should not assume he will depart the scene immediately ... Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, is expected to address the nation shortly after suffering what looks like a heavy defeat in the constitutional referendum which he called \u2013 and after which he promised to resign if he lost. Renzi has just tweeted to thank his supporters \u201canyway\u201d, and to confirm he will be speaking live from Palazzo Chigi in a few minutes. \u201cLong live Italy! PS I\u2019m coming,\u201d he concludes. The Northern League\u2019s Matteo Salvini is clearly ecstatic with the No camp\u2019s sweeping victory, writes Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Rome. The xenophobic Salvini clearly saw the victory as part of the right wing\u2019s onward march: But, explains Stephanie, even if it looks like Renzi was indeed trounced, that does not necessarily mean that every Italian who voted No was voting in favour of Salvini or his brother-in-arms, the M5S\u2019s Beppe Grillo: While some saw the plebiscite as a vote of no confidence in the prime minister, others \u2013 including those on the left and some within Renzi\u2019s own party \u2013 saw the referendum as strictly a question on the topic at hand: whether or not to change the constitution. Indeed, some \u2013 like a former communist the Guardian chatted with yesterday \u2013 voted No precisely because of concerns that rightwing forces were gaining traction. The reforms were seen by these opponents as weakening Italy\u2019s democracy and potentially handing too much power to whoever inhabits the prime minister\u2019s residence at Palazzo Chigi. Having had to commiserate with Norbert Hofer, the losing far-right candidate in Austria\u2019s presidential election, Marine Le Pen, the leader of France\u2019s far-right Front National, cheers Matteo Salvini\u2019s far-right Lega Nord \u2013 which backed the victorious No camp in Italy\u2019s referendum: The Italian interior ministry has a live results page, which you can visit here. This is what it looked like almost exactly an hour after the polls closed: The first projection based on the actual vote count in Italy\u2019s constitutional referendum shows Matteo Renzi may have suffered an even heavier defeat, Reuters reports: The projection by the Piepoli Institute/IPR for state broadcaster RAI estimated those voting \u2018Yes\u2019 to back the reform at 39-43%, compared with 57-61% for \u2018No\u2019. The projection pointed to an even wider defeat for Renzi than was suggested by three exit polls published immediately after polls closed. My colleague Graeme Wearden has this on the reaction of Europe\u2019s single currency to news of the Italian prime minister\u2019s possible referendum defeat: Europe\u2019s single currency took an immediate dive on the foreign exchange markets when the referendum exit polls were released, but it\u2019s not a full-blown crash. The euro has fallen by one cent against the US dollar, or almost 1%, to $1.0573. Some economists have warned that a No victory would hamper efforts to recapitalise Italy\u2019s banks, and undermine efforts to reform the country\u2019s economy, which has been dogged by weak growth for the last 15 years. The Guardian\u2019s Stephanie Kirchgaessner has sent her initial analysis of the first exit polls in Italy\u2019s constitutional reform referendum, which predict Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi is heading for defeat: If the exit polls hold, the results will be read as a victory not only for the anti-establishment M5S, but for Matteo Salvini\u2019s anti-immigrant Northern League. Voter turnout was especially strong in areas of Lombardy and Veneto that are considered strongholds of the Northern League, or Lega Nord, as it is known in Italy. Renzi is expected to speak at midnight in Italy. Lorenzo Guerini, a top official from the prime minister\u2019s PD party, declined to comment on the results in a brief statement in which he said the high voter turnout was a positive sign for the country\u2019s democracy. The possible win for the No camp could rattle European and global markets that had been rooting for a Renzi victory and will not want to see the country besieged by more economic and political uncertainty just as its economy was \u2013 slowly \u2013 improving. In the days leading up to the vote, unnamed bankers expressed concerns in media reports that a no win could even destabilise plans to rescue Banca Monte dei Paschi of Siena. And here\u2019s what that looks like in graphic form, together with the turnout \u2013 69.1%. Remember, these are very much provisional figures based on exit polls, which are often unreliable in Italy. Projections of the result based on the actual vote count can now be expected at regular intervals of around 30 minutes, with the first due before midnight. They should become increasingly accurate as the night goes on. Here is Reuters\u2019 first take on the predicted heavy defeat for Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi in the referendum on constitutional reforms on which he has staked his political future: Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has suffered a heavy defeat in a referendum over his plan to reform the constitution, according to exit polls. Renzi has said he would resign if Italians rejected his plan to reduce the role of the upper house Senate and claw back powers from regional authorities. He is due to address the nation at around midnight (2300 GMT). An exit poll by the Piepoli Institute/IPR for state television station RAI, estimated those voting \u2018Yes\u2019 to back the reform at 42-46 percent, compared with 54-58 percent for \u2018No\u2019. Two other polls - by Tecne\u2019 for privately owned TV channel Mediaset, by EMG Acqua for La 7 - gave \u2018No\u2019 a similar lead of at least 10 points. Voting ended at 11 p.m. Italy\u2019s exit polls are notoriously unreliable, says Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Rome, but early indications are showing a win for No. Rai News estimates 58-54% of Italians favoured No, while 46-42% supported Yes. If the results hold, it will be a major defeat of Matteo Renzi and Italy\u2019s centre-left Democratic party and a big win for his opponents in the Five Star Movement and the far-right Northern League. Polling stations have just closed in Italy, where voters are having their say in a referendum on constitutional reform backed by prime minister Matteo Renzi and most of his supporters in the Democratic party but opposed by his rivals on the left and right, including Beppe Grillo\u2019s M5S, in large part because they want to force Renzi out. Stephanie Kirchgaessner, the Guardian\u2019s Rome correspondent, says: With just minutes to go before the polls close, pundits in Italy are saying one thing is clear: the constitutional referendum was treated as a general election and showed Italians were highly motivated to make their voices heard. Now we have to wait to see what it is they\u2019re telling us. The Guardian\u2019s foreign affairs analyst Simon Tisdall has this to say about what Alexander Van der Bellen\u2019s victory in Austria\u2019s presidential elections means for Europe in the wake of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU and Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US: The sigh of relief that followed Alexander Van der Bellen\u2019s victory in Austria\u2019s rerun presidential election on Sunday could be heard all over Europe. After the twin traumas of Trump and Brexit, centrist parties, social democrats and liberals of all stripes had feared another triumph for the advancing forces of nativist populism represented by Van der Bellen\u2019s rival, the far-right Freedom party\u2019s Norbert Hofer. [But] comforting though Van der Bellen\u2019s victory may be for European progressives, the fact remains that slightly more than 46% of Austrian voters backed Hofer\u2019s candidacy. That figure reveals a nation that is sharply divided, and overall, more rightwing and intolerant in its outlook than previously. You can read his full commentary here. A quick reminder of what exactly Italians are supposed to be voting on today (as is the way with referendums, many will of course be voting on something else altogether), courtesy again of Stephanie Kirchgaessner: A series of major changes to the Italian political system. These reforms, which affect a third of the Italian constitution, have already been approved by parliament but by a slim margin, thus requiring that they also be passed by referendum. Under the current system, which was created under Italy\u2019s 1948 constitution, there are two chambers of parliament with directly elected lawmakers, the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Both have equal power and both must agree on legislation before it is passed. This means it can take a very long time for things to get done. Under the proposed reforms, the Senate would lose almost all its power \u2013 the number of senators would be reduced from 315 to 100, and the remaining senators would no longer be elected directly. Instead, the 100 would be made up of lawmakers selected by regional assemblies. Some mayors would also serve as senators. If the yes campaign wins, most laws could be passed, including Italy\u2019s budget, by the Chamber of Deputies without consulting the Senate, arguably making the whole process of passing laws a lot easier. The Senate would only have the power to weigh in on big issues such as other constitutional reforms and the ratification of EU treaties. Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s Rome correspondent Stephanie Kirchgaessner\u2019s latest take on what the high turnout in Italy\u2019s constitutional referendum could mean ... In a word (or four), no one really knows: Figures released by the interior ministry showed that about 55% of eligible voters had cast their ballots as of 7pm. However, the relatively high turnout did not clearly favour the centre-left government\u2019s campaign or the opposition, led by the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S), because both sides have strongholds in high-voting regions. Italy\u2019s prime minister Matteo Renzi will address the nation at around midnight (2300 GMT), Reuters reports, an hour after polls close in the high-risk referendum on constitutional reform on which he has staked his premiership (he\u2019s said he\u2019ll resign if he loses.) Exit polls are due to be released as soon as ballots close, but full results are not due until after 2am at the earliest. Some eager souls are already there: In Italy, the Guardian\u2019s southern Europe specialist John Hooper reckons that based on the high turnout figures, we should maybe not be dismissing prime minister Matteo Renzi\u2019s chances of pulling off the second upset of the night too soon: Following politicians in neighbouring Germany, France\u2019s Socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has said Van der Bellen\u2019s win over the far-right\u2019s Hofer in Austria\u2019s presidential election represents a vote for European unity and tolerance. Hollande, who announced last week that he would not be seeking a second mandate in France\u2019s presidential polls next year, said he \u201cwarmly congratulates Alexander Van der Bellen for the clear and uncontested result\u201d, adding that the Austrian people had \u201cmade the choice for Europe, and openness.\u201d Marine Le Pen of France\u2019s far-right Front National, who is widely expected to make it through to the run-off round of the presidential election in May, sent her congratulations to Hofer, saying he had fought courageously and predicting his Freedom party would win next year\u2019s parliamentary election in Austria: Alexander Van der Bellen has been holding a press conference in Vienna and the Guardian\u2019s Philip Oltermann was there. The newly elected head of state said he would be an \u201copen-minded, liberal-minded, and above all a pro-European president\u201d, adding that his triumph over Norbert Hofer of the far-right Freedom party sent a \u201cmessage to the capitals of the EU that one can win elections with high European positions.\u201d The defeated Hofer said his loss was \u201creally very painful ... but the voter is always right in a democracy.\u201d He also criticised an intervention by Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, as having contributed to the party\u2019s defeat. Farage said on Fox News on Friday that Hofer would hold a referendum on Austria leaving the European Union. Pointing out that an overwhelming majority of Austrians support EU membership, Hofer described the Ukip figurehead\u2019s comments as \u201ca crass misjudgement\u201d, adding: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t fill me with joy when someone meddles from outside.\u201d So who is the new Austrian president? Alexander Van der Bellen is a tall, austere 72-year-old retired economics professor, a Green MP for 18 years before leaving parliament in 2012 to become a popular Vienna city councillor. Van der Bellen\u2019s father was born in Russia to a family descended from Dutch immigrants. His mother was born in Estonia, from where both fled when the Red Army invaded in 1940, moving first to Germany and eventually settling in Austria. Viewed by many conservatives as too leftwing, and by more militant Greens as not radical enough, Van der Bellen spent the early part of his political career in the Social Democrats. He campaigned on an unashamedly pro-European platform, arguing that Austria\u2019s economic growth depended on it and saying this evening: From the beginning, I fought and argued for a pro-European Austria. I would think it a big mistake to promote the drifting apart of the EU. Known as Sascha in reference to his Russian roots, Van der Bellen led the Greens from 1997 to 2008, turning the party into the country\u2019s fourth biggest political force and stepping down only after elections in which it lost votes for the first time in a decade. A heavy smoker \u2013 \u201cI once quit for four months \u2026 but why should I torture myself at my age?\u201d \u2013 and outspoken supporter of gay marriage, he is divorced and recently remarried. He lists American crime novels, 19th-century Russian literature and Donald Duck cartoons among his interests. The Guardian\u2019s Angela Giuffrida has been talking to voters in Italy\u2019s constitutional reform referendum. She spoke first to Alessandra Castelli, who has lived in London for more than 10 years and may be one of the millions of Italian voters abroad to whom prime minister Matteo Renzi is looking to for salvation: This is an occasion to really change Italy. Most of the people voting No are the ones wanting to keep the the current government out. They don\u2019t care if it takes ages to approve a legislation, they just want Renzi out. But this is ridiculous , in a country where for 70 years we had 63 governments, and where at the G7 we always have to send a different prime minister. Those who have to actually endure Italy\u2019s stagnating economy, however, beg to differ. In Orvieto, 36-year-old chef and restaurant owner Valentina Santanicchio said: It\u2019s fine for those living a nice life in Berlin or London looking towards Italy and saying \u2018it needs to change\u2019 - we\u2019re the ones who have to live through the misery here. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t think we need a change in the constitution, but there are other priorities, the main one being jobs. Italy has so much potential, but it\u2019s wasted. I\u2019m nervous about the potential instability, but this is a government we didn\u2019t elect. The victorious Austrian independent presidential candidate, Alexander Van der Bellen, said his unexpectedly comfortable projected win over the right-wing populist Norbert Hofer showed voters supported his message of \u201cfreedom, equality, solidarity\u201d. Van der Bellen, a former economics professor and left-leaning one-time leader of the Green party, said he would work to unite a country that was deeply split between the moderate liberals who voted for him and those who backed instead Hofer\u2019s Eurosceptic, anti-immigrant Freedom Party. Final results will not be available until more than 500,000 absentee ballots are counted on Monday, the interior ministry said, but with most ballots cast on Sunday now counted, Van der Bellen appears to have an unassailable 53.3% of the vote. Back in Italy, Stephanie Kirchgaessner has an update on the turnout in the country\u2019s crunch referendum on proposed constitutional reforms. The prime minister, Matteo Renzi, has promised to resign if he loses the plebiscite, prompting fears of possible political and eurozone uncertainty: About 57% of Italian voters have cast their ballots in this referendum as of 7pm, a strong showing for a complicated question about the nation\u2019s constitution. The high turnout numbers lend credence to the view that this vote has really touched a nerve in Italy, and is seen by some as a vote of confidence in prime minister Matteo Renzi. It looked initially like turnout figures in the south were going to be far lower than northern and central Italy, but it now seems they have caught up. It\u2019s hard, though, to make too many sweeping assumptions about this \u2013 while some Renzi strongholds will encourage the prime minister, other cities that back the far-right Northern League, which opposes the reforms, have also come out in full force. The Austrian federal chancellor, Social Democrat Christian Kern, has congratulated Van der Bellen for his victory over the far-right\u2019s Norbert Hofer. In a clear allusion to fears by mainstream politicians that a win for Hofer and his party\u2019s anti-immigrant views would have harmed the country\u2019s image abroad, Kern added that: I am convinced that we will have a president with Van der Bellen who will represent Austria domestically and abroad in an excellent manner. Martin Schulz, the German president of the European parliament, has congratulated Van der Bellen, saying he won Austria\u2019s presidential election with \u201ca clear pro-European message and campaign\u201d, and describing the victory as: Partial results showed Van der Bellen with 53.3% and his far-right, anti-immigrant Freedom Party rival Norbert Hofer on 46.7%. The Conference of European Rabbis, which represent more than 700 leaders of mainstream synagogues across the continent, is delighted with the defeat of the far-right candidate in Austria\u2019s presidential election. Austria has just passed a difficult test. Let\u2019s hope that the results in Austria will strengthen political forces in Europe which are committed to combat racism, antisemitism and xenophobia. The Guardian published this article on Saturday on why the Jewish community was praying the Freedom party\u2019s Norbert Hofer would fail to win the presidency. Fresh from Vienna, here\u2019s Philip Oltermann\u2019s more considered take on the unexpected outcome of Austria\u2019s presidential election: Austria on Sunday decisively rejected the possibility of European Union getting its first far-right head of state, instead electing a strongly pro-European former leader of the Green party as its next president. Alexander Van der Bellen, who ran as an independent, managing to increase his lead over Freedom Party candidate Norbert Hofer by a considerable margin from the original vote in May, which was annulled by the constitutional vote due to sloppy voting. The rightwing populist candidate for the Austrian presidency conceded his defeat within less than half an hour of the first exit polls, writing on Facebook: \u201cI congratulate Alexander Van der Bellen for his success and ask all Austrians to pull together and work together. The 45-year-old said he was \u201cendlessly sad\u201d and \u201cwould have liked to look after Austria\u201d. Freedom Party secretary Herbert Kickl, who has acted as Hofer\u2019s campaign manager, said: \u201cThe bottom line is it didn\u2019t quite work out. In this case the establishment - which pitched in once again to block, to stonewall and to prevent renewal - has won.\u201d Werner Kogler, a delegate for the Green Party, described the result as a \u201csmall global turning of the tide in these uncertain, not to say hysterical and even stupid times\u201d. You can read Philip\u2019s full report here. Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, has reacted to the news that the left-leaning, Green-backed candidate Alexander Van der Bellen is on course for an unexpectedly comfortable win over his far-right rival Norbert Hofer in the Austrian presidential elections: Angela Giuffrida is on the ground for the Guardian in Orvieto, Italy, where she interviewed Steve Brenner, an American expat with dual citizenship who owns a hotel in Rome and voted No in the referendum because he is not convinced the reforms would actually create a more efficient, cheaper, and smaller government, as the Yes camp has said. Italy, from what I understand, does not have a problem with the number of laws it passes. It has a problem with enforcing them. It has a problem with the judiciary and executive process. As for stability, the biggest problem for me in Italy is a lack of faith in government. That undermines everything and it\u2019s what makes governments unstable. Back to Italy, where voters are still casting their ballots in the country\u2019s referendum on proposed constitutional reforms. Polls close at 11pm local time (10pm GMT). Exit polls \u2013 not very reliable, particularly early on in the evening \u2013 will be announced on Italian television as soon as polls close, with the first projections based on actual votes counted starting to appear from around 11.30pm. Those projections are then more or less every half hour, becoming steadily more accurate as the night wears on. If the result is clear-cut, the winner could be known by around midnight \u2013 if not, the result may come as late as 3am. A reader, Heather Hampson, has asked about the Guardian\u2019s use of the terms \u201cfar right\u201d and \u201calt-right\u201d \u2013 which some see as a term that sanitises the movement it describes \u2013 and how we distinguish the two. As it happens, our style team published its guidance on just this subject, along with an explanation for it, last week. Essentially, the Guardian has not banned the use of \u201calt-right\u201d because it exists as a term that is used in the world, particularly in the US, and \u201cit is the media\u2019s job to describe and reflect the world as it is.\u201d But it also believes the media should describe and reflect that world \u2013 including the \u201calt-right\u201d \u2013 accurately. So this is the style team\u2019s guidance: alt-right: Use once, with a hyphen and in quotes, at first mention, followed by the brief but broad description of it being a far-right movement. Prefer far right (noun) or far-right (adjective) at any subsequent mention. More specific descriptions can be used where relevant when mentioning individuals associated with the movement, but such descriptions should be evidence-based. Alexander Van der Bellen\u2019s provisional victory in Austria\u2019s presidential election has been enthusiastically welcomed across the border in neighbouring Germany, which faces key elections of its own before next autumn. Vice chancellor Sigmar Gabriel of the centre-left Social Democrats told Bild newspaper: A load has been taken off the mind of all of Europe. This is a clear victory for good sense against right-wing populism. Manfred Weber, the influential head of the main centre-right group in the European parliament, tweeted: and then added: Ulrich Kelber, another Social Democrat, suggested that Donald Trump\u2019s election may have been a turning point and \u201cthe liberal majority pushes back\u201d, while the Germany Greens leader, Simone Peter, said it was a \u201cgood day for Austria and Europe. The right-wing rabble-rousers have to be stopped!\u201d In Italy, Stephanie Kirchgaessner has details of an embarrassing moment for prime minister Matteo Renzi as he cast his ballot in today\u2019s referendum on constitutional reforms. There\u2019s pretty high level scrutiny for voters in Italy. You have to show identification and a voter registration card, which gets stamped once you have cast your ballot. Footage taken of prime minister Matteo Renzi shows he forgot to bring his ID, but poll workers let it go. Norbert Hofer has posted on his Facebook page, thanking his supporters and congratulating Van der Bellen. Here\u2019s a (rough) translation: Dear friends, I would like to thank you. You have given me such great support, and I am incredibly sad that it didn\u2019t work out. I would have liked to watch over our Austria. I congratulate Alexander Van der Bellen on his success and ask all Austrians to stick together and to work together. We are all, equally, Austrians, no matter how we voted at the ballot box. Der Spiegel\u2019s deputy foreign editor, Mathieu van Rohr, predicts the scale of left-wing candidate Alexander Van der Bellen\u2019s win in Austria. That\u2019s quite a swing, and it is at least possible that part of it may be down to voters\u2019 uncertainty following the shock results of the Brexit referendum vote and Trump\u2019s US presidential victory. The defeat of far-right candidate Norbert Hofer to the liberal, left-of-centre Alexander Van der Bellen in Austria\u2019s presidential elections marks a setback for the Eurosceptic, anti-establishment cause in Europe. After Britain\u2019s shock vote to leave the EU and Donald Trump\u2019s unexpected win in the US, insurgents across the continent, including Geert Wilders of the Dutch Freedom party and Marine Le Pen of France\u2019s Front national, hailed upsets that, in Le Pen\u2019s words, \u201cmade the impossible possible\u201d. Today\u2019s Austrian vote was seen as the first in a strong of upcoming tests for Europe, with a victory for Hofer likely to further embolden the populists in potentially pivotal presidential and parliamentary elections due in the Netherlands, France and Germany over the course of 12 months. For a more in-depth overview of what could still turn out to be a critical year for the future of the European project in its current form, you can have a look at my analysis of the issues facing the bloc, which was published yesterday. Back to Italy now, after that unexpected early result from Austria. Stephanie Kirchgaessner reports that a no vote there will be seen as a huge rebuke of Renzi and a big win for M5S, which has already said it would call for immediate elections if their side wins. The conventional wisdom is that Italy is facing a populist backlash much like Brexit in the UK and Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US. This view is not wrong, but there are many voters who will vote against the reform who are not necessarily fans of Five Star-founder Beppe Grillo or the Northern League\u2019s Matteo Salvini. Renzi has a fair share of critics on the left, and many are simply unhappy with the proposed constitutional changes. But that does not mean they would support M5S or the far-right Northern League in a national election. A yes vote would mark a really stunning turnaround for Renzi, considering how much opposition he was up against heading into the race. The far-right Austrian presidential candidate Norbert Hofer\u2019s campaign manager, Herbert Kickl, has conceded his candidate\u2019s defeat to former Greens leader Alexander Van der Bellen, Reuters reports. Kickl told the state broadcaster: The bottom line is it didn\u2019t quite work out. In this case the establishment - which pitched in once again to block, to stonewall and to prevent renewal - has won. If confirmed, the margin of Van der Bellen\u2019s forecast win over Hofer in Austria is a major surprise. Polls in the run-up to the vote had the two candidates neck-and-neck, with several putting the far-right Freedom party\u2019s Hofer ahead. But the first official results, released minutes ago, show the independent with 53.5% of the vote, with Hofer 46.4%. Interior ministry officials have told the Associated Press that votes obviously continue to be counted and the percentages are therefore almost certain to vary, but the outcome is now unlikely to change. Hofer\u2019s campaign manager appears to confirm the early exit poll trend, telling state broadcaster ORF that Van der Bellen has won, Reuter\u2019s reports. Philip Oltermann in Vienna reports that early exit polls indicate Austria has voted in Green-backed candidate Alexander Van der Bellen as its next president, handing a painful defeat to rightwing populist Norbert Hofer. According to public broadcaster ORF, Alexander Van der Bellen had gained 53.6% of the vote with 58% of voting districts counted \u2013 too strong a lead to be turned around for Freedom Party candidate Norbert Hofer, who had only gained 46.6% of the vote. The margin of error is around 1.2%, which accounts for the optimism now coming form the Van der Bellen camp. With officials under clear instructions not to cut any corners to avoid another embarrassing recount, many experts have suggested a definitive result may not emerged until Monday, Tuesday, or possibly even Wednesday. The Freedom Party candidate and his wife Verena Hofer cast their votes in his hometown of Pinkafeld in Burgenland, the easternmost and least populous region of Austria. \u201cI am calm and confident\u201d, he told the press outside the voting booth. Van der Bellen and his wife Doris Schmidauer voted at around 11 am at a school in Vienna\u2019s Mariahilf district, telling journalists that he did not expect a clear result until Monday. Stephanie Kirchgaessner reports that there is already one alleged voting irregularity getting a good deal of attention in Italy today: We can call it Pencilgate. The Tuscan singer PieTro Pel\u00f9 claimed in a complaint that has circulated online that was given a pencil at the polls that was erasable. In comment on social media, some responded by saying that the pencil was indeed indelible on the section of the ballot where people actually vote, but not on normal paper. In Austria, reports Philip Oltermann, polling booths have now closed and the first region has been counted. Only anecdotal evidence so far, but the first two districts that were 50/50 in May now show a lead for Van der Bellen. The first projections will be without the capital, Vienna, so could well show Hofer in the lead. The first Vienna districts will be coming through at about 6pm local time. In Italy, writes the Guardian\u2019s Rome correspondent Stephanie Kirchgaessner, there are still many hours to go before voters will know the outcome of today\u2019s referendum. Polls close at 11pm local time, but we\u2019re not likely to know the results for a while later and exit polls are not considered to be especially reliable. Official voter turnout figures released at noon, which will be updated at 7pm, show relatively high turnout in northern and central Italy, and low turnout in the south. That may favour Renzi and the yes camp, but it\u2019s difficult to draw too many conclusions. It looks like pro-Renzi Florence and the area around Bologna had a high turnout in the morning, but so did strongholds of the rightwing Northern League, which supports the no vote. A brief guide, first, to who\u2019s who and what\u2019s what in the presidential election in Austria, where polls have just closed. The candidates: Hofer, a 45-year old engineer who has risen through the ranks of his Eurosceptic, anti-immigrant Freedom party. A smooth talker with a ready smile, he changes his style, tone and the contents of his message depending on his audience. Van der Bellen is a former economics professor, running as an independent but backed by the Greens. He\u2019s strongly supportive of the EU, is in favour of liberal migration policies, and often sounds the alarm against what he sees as Europe\u2019s rightward drift The issues: Essentially, Austria\u2019s political direction. The president\u2019s role islargely ceremonial, but a win for Hofer would signal a lurch to the right for the country and a symbolic blow to the European project. A victory for Van der Bellen would hearten pro-EU and anti-nationalist leaders. Why now? The race was supposed to be won in May, when Van der Bellen defeated Hofer by less than a point, but the Freedom Party contested the result and on July 1 Austria\u2019s constitutional Court ruled the elections had to be re-run. An earlier date in October was pushed back to today after problems with the envelopes on some postal ballots, which wouldn\u2019t seal. Who can vote and when will we know the results? About 6.4 million voters over 16 can vote. Early results issued by the interior ministry should be available about an hour after polls close, with as-good-as-final results out by late evening \u2013 although if the race is very close, postal ballots will count and a final result might not be known bfore Monday or even Tuesday. Good afternoon and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of what could prove a pivotal day in European politics. Polls are about to close in Austria, where voters are choosing a new president who, surveys predict, could be the first freely-elected far-right leader of a western European country since the second world war. In Italy, meanwhile, the prime minister, Matteo Renzi, has staked his political future on a constitutional reform referendum that he looks set to lose, potentially opening a path to power for the anti-establishment, anti-euro Five Star Movement. Norbert Hofer, whose far-right, anti-immigrant Freedom party was founded by a former SS officer, and Alexander Van der Bellen, the son of Estonian refugees who is backed by the Green party, are re-running their contest of last May. Austria\u2019s constitutional court overturned the result of that, which Van der Bellen won by the narrowest of margins, due to irregularities in the processing of the postal vote. Recent polls suggest this time Hofer may have the edge. In Italy, voters are giving their verdict on a raft of changes to the political system that will \u2013 Renzi argues \u2013 streamline the decision-making process by reducing the power of the senate. It\u2019s all quite complicated, but what matters is that the prime minister has said he will resign if he loses. That raises the prospect \u2013 though by no means the certainty \u2013 of political and economic instability and early elections that Beppe Grillo\u2019s unpredictable, populist M5S could win, a prospect that alarms many in Italy and beyond even if the chances of it actually forming a government are not great. But while the actual consequences are far from clear, after the UK\u2019s shock Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u2019s upset win in the US presidential election, victory for Hofer and defeat for Renzi would at the very least mark two more big steps forward for the anti-establishment, nation-first parties challenging the political mainstream across Europe. And with pivotal elections \u2013 and populist, Eurosceptic advances, perhaps triumphs \u2013 coming up next year in several EU member states including the Netherlands, France and Germany, there is a real chance that historians will look back on tonight\u2019s events as the beginning of the end of the European project in its current form. The Guardian\u2019s Berlin bureau chief, Philip Oltermann, and Italy correspondent, Stephanie Kirchgaessner, are in Vienna and Rome and will be contributing their insights throughout what could well be a long evening.
