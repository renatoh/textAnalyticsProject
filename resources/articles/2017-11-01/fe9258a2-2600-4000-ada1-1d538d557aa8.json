The brown thornbill, Acanthiza pusilla archibaldi, is a subspecies of the Tasmanian thornbill, distinguished from its cousins on the big island by a slightly longer beak. It is about 10cm long, coloured various shades of brown, and thoroughly unexciting to the untrained eye. Hobcroft\u2019s was only the fourth confirmed sighting since 1974. According to a forthcoming review of Australia\u2019s avian threatened species programs, the King Island brown thornbill is most likely to be the next bird to be declared extinct. It shares the podium with the King Island scrubtit, Acanthornis magnus greenianus, which, with a population of fewer than 50 adults spread across three isolated areas of ever-shrinking melaleuca swamp, is No 3 on the list. The orange-bellied parrot, which stops off on King Island on its precarious annual flight from south-western Tasmania to the Victorian coast, and has a wild adult population of fewer than 20 individuals, is the second. The difference is, you have probably heard of the orange-bellied parrot. As of Wednesday, it had garnered more than 1,700 votes in the Guardian\u2019s bird of the year poll, and last year a crowdfunding campaign raised $140,000 to fund fieldwork during its breeding season. The thornbill didn\u2019t make the list. The King Island brown thornbill heads a list of unmarketable, critically endangered little brown birds. Neither it nor the scrubtit, which shares its habitat, have received meaningful funding. Nor have they been the subject of a concerted research effort. The King Island natural resource management group applied for a share of the $5m federal threatened species recovery fund earlier this year, but was rejected. The group\u2019s coordinator, Kate Ravich, is trying to raise the profile of the King Island scrubtit, a \u201chappy little bird\u201d whose habitat backs on to her backyard. \u201cThey are a little brown bird. They are not sexy,\u201d she says. \u201cOrange-bellied parrots are very sexy because they are rare and colourful. Some birds are easy to sell and everyone loves them, and others are very hard to sell because they are little brown birds.\u201d The Australian National University researcher Matt Webb led the most recent published research on the King Island scrubtit in 2015. Scrubtits have been listed as critically endangered since the 1990s and the population fell by 75% after a bushfire in 2007 which destroyed 90% of available habitat at Nook swamp, one of its last remaining strongholds. When Webb spoke to Guardian Australia he was on the Tasmanian mainland working on the swift parrot conservation program, which is part of the difficult bird research group, alongside the orange-bellied parrot. Sugar gliders have been eating the young swift parrots, hampering recovery efforts. Webb says it would be much easier to save the King Island scrubtit than any of the headline-grabbing Tasmanian parrots if only it could attract some decent funding. He is not optimistic. There are hundreds of threatened species vying for a share of limited annual funding. Despite being two of the most imperilled birds in Australia, King Island brown thornbills and scrubtits are not high on the list. \u201cAny money that has gone towards the King Island scrubtit \u2026 it\u2019s been through NRMs [natural resource management groups] or other smaller bodies, and it\u2019s really small amounts of money, $5,000 or $10,000,\u201d Webb says. \u201cYou look at what\u2019s required for things like [orange-bellied parrots] and swift parrots and the amount of money required is orders of magnitude greater than anything that\u2019s appeared [for the scrubtit]. I would be so pleasantly surprised if serious money was put on the table for the species but really, unless we\u2019re going to try and do it properly, it\u2019s probably not worth doing.\u201d Preserving the species would mean protecting the remaining melaleuca swamp, controlling hazard-reduction burns, managing the acid sulphate soils which can cause significant habitat destruction, and possibly transferring birds between the island\u2019s three isolated populations to give it the genetic diversity necessary to survive the hundred or so years until the burnt-out melaleuca swamp grows back into the ideal habitat. Not enough is known about the brown thornbill to tailor a recovery effort, but the habitats of the two species overlap, so Webb says it\u2019s a fair guess that what\u2019s good for one would benefit the other. So far neither species has attracted significant attention. \u201cOne of the issues with the King Island scrubtit is it is a subspecies, and often subspecies don\u2019t get as much attention,\u201d Webb says. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how that\u2019s not very consistent, because there\u2019s things like the Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle that\u2019s a subspecies \u2013 some would say it\u2019s not even that \u2013 and that receives a lot of attention. \u201cBut then, they\u2019re an eagle. This is a little brown bird. If you look up closely it\u2019s actually quite beautiful but barely anyone gets close to it.\u201d The problem is not endemic to King Island. Two other little brown birds identified as among the most imperilled by the threatened species research are the clumsily named Mount Lofty Ranges chestnut-rumped heathwren, Hylacola pyrrhopygia parkeri, a 20g bird from South Australia\u2019s Fleurieu peninsula; and the Grey Range thick-billed grasswren, Amytornis modestus obscurior, newly rediscovered in western New South Wales. Neither has a detailed recovery plan because there is little survey data available. \u201cYou would be surprised how many birds out there have a handful left and there\u2019s not much happening,\u201d says BirdLife Australia\u2019s head of conservation, Samantha Vine. BirdLife is using the threatened species research, led by Charles Darwin University\u2019s Prof Stephen Garnett, to shape its preventing extinctions program, focusing on the 20 most imperilled species. Vine, who is also an informal expert adviser to the commonwealth threatened species commissioner, says access to threatened species funding takes a lot of lobbying. \u201cIt really is up to those sort of committed champions to raise the alarm and lobby for resources,\u201d Vine says. \u201cYou would be surprised how many times a species has been saved from extinction by a handful of people.\u201d An example can be found in a 10,000km square patch of native grassland in western NSW, just south of Hay, where the plains wanderer, an odd little bird that looks like a cross between a quail and a very short emu, is enjoying something of a reprieve. The state\u2019s population of plains wanderers, Pedionomus torquatus, declined by 90% since 2001 because successive years of drought, followed by a few years of flood, deprived the fussy bird of its preferred level of grass cover. A similar decline was seen over the border in Victoria. BirdLife Australia convened a summit on the bird in 2014, as part of a campaign on forgotten species, and warned that the critically endangered bird \u2013 the only member of its family in Australia \u2013 could be lost. The NSW government responded. A captive breeding program has begun at Sydney\u2019s Taronga Zoo, a national recovery plan was developed, and threatened species officers from the office of environment and heritage have been working with local landholders to develop grazing management strategies to support the birds. One of those threatened species officers is David Parker. \u201cA really core part of it is maintaining appropriate grazing regimes and most of the time it\u2019s just status quo with what landholders typically do out there,\u201d he tells Guardian Australia. \u201cIn times of drought it\u2019s usually making sure that the habitat isn\u2019t overstocked, or in wet times making sure there\u2019s lots of grazing in there that sort of kept ahead of the grass growth. If it\u2019s too bare they disappear and if it\u2019s too tall they disappear from that area as well.\u201d Parker said the bird was not widely known among the general population, but \u201cif you\u2019re a birdwatcher, a mad twitcher, it\u2019s one of the birds that\u2019s on the top of your twitching list\u201d. \u201cI like to think it\u2019s all about the legs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe female is more brightly coloured, again a real oddity amongst the bird world \u2026 she\u2019s got really strong straw-yellow legs and bill. And she\u2019s got a rufous breast patch and a nice collar around her neck, black and white collar, whereas the male\u2019s quite dull.\u201d Another species targeted by BirdLife\u2019s forgotten birds campaign, which has since been subject to a concerted conservation effort, is the Mallee emuwren, Stipiturus mallee. Weighing about the same as a teaspoon of sugar and with a tuft of blue feathers on its chest, the Mallee emuwren has the advantage of being objectively adorable. A bushfire in 2014 wiped out the South Australian population, and the remaining habitat in Victoria\u2019s Mallee region is increasingly vulnerable to bushfires sparked by climate change. South Australia has now begun a captive breeding program and is working to reintroduce the bird to the state. The bushfire was the wake-up call needed to direct funding and attention to the little bird, which is rumoured to be a favourite of the threatened species commissioner, Gregory Andrews. \u201cIt shows what can happen if we respond in time,\u201d Vine says. \u201cI actually think in a few years we will be looking back at the Mallee emuwren and seeing a really different story there, but it\u2019s one that could have easily gone off the radar if people hadn\u2019t rallied around it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
