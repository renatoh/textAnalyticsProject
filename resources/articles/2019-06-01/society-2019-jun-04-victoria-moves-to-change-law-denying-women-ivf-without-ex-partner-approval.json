The legal change is in response to a case last year in which a Melbourne reproductive clinic told a woman that under Victoria\u2019s Assisted Reproductive Treatment Act, she first needed her estranged husband\u2019s consent. The 45-year-old woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had been separated and living apart from her husband since late 2017. The matter was urgent because patients were generally able to use their own eggs in an IVF procedure only when they are younger than 46. The woman took her case to the federal court and the judge ruled in her favour. Lawyers from Maurice Blackburn, who represented the woman, relied on Victoria\u2019s Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act to argue she had a right not to be discriminated against based on her marital status. During the court case, the clinic, Melbourne IVF, said it had no objection to offering the treatment to the woman without her husband\u2019s consent if the court found it was legal to do so. Justice John Griffiths ordered that the woman could undergo IVF without consent and declared parts of the Victorian laws were \u201cinvalid and inoperable\u201d. Victorian Assisted Reproductive Treatment Authority chief executive Louise Johnson said divorce proceedings could take a long period of time, which some women trying to conceive did not have. \u201cI recently had a phone call from a clinic telling me that a single woman, who was going through a divorce and separated, was considering travelling interstate for treatment,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWhen it comes to fertility treatment, time matters. A year can make a difference to the quality of eggs if you\u2019re a women in your late 30s, early 40s. This can impact on their chance of success.\u201d Jennifer Kanis, a spokeswoman for Maurice Blackburn, praised moves to modernise the outdated law. \u201cVictorian women should not have their former partner control their reproductive choices,\u201d she said. If the laws are passed, IVF clinics will have to make changes to paperwork. In April last year, the Victorian government announced a review of the state\u2019s IVF laws."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
