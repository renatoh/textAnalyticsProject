The \u00a34.7m summer signing will start the EFL Cup third-round tie at the iPro Stadium having been sidelined at the start of the season by a broken hand. Karius featured in pre-season when Simon Mignolet was on a break following Euro 2016 and, eight weeks after sustaining the injury against Chelsea, their competition to be Liverpool\u2019s first\u2011choice keeper can commence with the 23\u2011year\u2011old\u2019s inclusion against Nigel Pearson\u2019s struggling side. Liverpool\u2019s manager insists his decision to buy Karius from Mainz does not guarantee he will be preferred to Mignolet. But, despite the Belgium international\u2019s encouraging form this season, Klopp admits the No1 position is not taken. \u201cLoris will play, if nothing happens,\u201d Klopp confirmed. \u201cHe was a really strong Bundesliga goalkeeper and that means a lot. Germany is a goalkeeper country. We have no issue with goalkeepers. The best keeper in the world plays at Bayern Munich and is German. We have always had good ones, maybe not always the best in the world, but good ones. \u201cThe German mentality is we like this job. The kids like to wear gloves. It\u2019s good to be in goal for a Bundesliga team. I saw his way. He had a bad start at Mainz, when no one wanted him, to become an outstanding goalkeeper. We wanted him, I spoke to him and that is what we got. \u201cWhat we want is two really strong goalkeepers and that is what I think we have got. Loris had an advantage in pre-season but could not use it because of injury. In this moment Simon came back from the national team and did a brilliant job. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to make a big battle of these two goalkeepers, why should I? Goalkeepers need to feel secure but you can\u2019t play your whole life as a keeper without conceding goals. \u201cYou will always feel a bit guilty, more or less, but you want a manager who will say you can still stay and feel confident. I can\u2019t say \u2018today, him and then today him\u2019. The pressure on the players is big enough. I don\u2019t have to make any more, they have to do their best and then when I have a feeling for something I will change, or not. \u201cIt is not because we paid money for Loris and did not pay money last year for Simon that I make the decision. \u201cIt is about what I see in training, and what I see is two very good goalkeepers and another for the future we gave to Huddersfield [Danny Ward]. The business is done for this position hopefully and now they have to perform.\u201d Mignolet has responded well to the threat posed by the arrival of Karius, although his distribution was an occasional and obvious source of irritation to the Liverpool manager during the 2-1 victory at Chelsea on Friday. Klopp refused to confirm whether the former Sunderland goalkeeper would return to the team for the Premier League game against Hull City at Anfield on Saturday irrespective of Karius\u2019s display at Derby. He said: \u201cWhere is my possibility to answer? If I say \u2018Yes\u2019 what does that mean for Loris? If I say \u2018No\u2019 what does that mean for Simon? The question makes sense but the answer would not. \u201cThere is no No1 at this moment, there is no decision, it is just about performing and showing how good you are. For all players it is the same. I won\u2019t say someone is our centre-half for the next 15 months. It is about performing and improving. Show how much you can help the team.\u201d Liverpool will have Roberto Firmino available for the cup tie with the Brazilian forward back in training having missed the visit to Stamford Bridge with a minor groin problem. The Germany midfielder Emre Can, who has been sidelined by an ankle injury sustained in the EFL Cup victory at Burton Albion last month, is also in contention for a recall."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
