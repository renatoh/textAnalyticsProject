There are two types of holiday: one that you've been on before and one that is completely different. Generally, you have one that is completely different before you decide it's best to have one you've done before. Travel agents are like estate agents on fast-forward. They have half an hour to move you somewhere else for two weeks. Travel agents are at their most helpful when you know exactly where you want to go or when you don't care where you go. It's the people who haven't given their holiday a moment's thought until they step through the door who cause the most trouble. Inevitably, they step through the door seconds before you do. There are exclusive travel agents who will tailor a bespoke holiday to your exact requirements. You also get one-to-one guiding expertise and 24-hour concierge assistance. What this means is you're actually paying for the guide to have the exact same holiday as you're having. There aren't many exotic locations left for holidays - the Antarctic now has more tourists than penguins, the Amazon is like Henley Regatta and Cambodia has 15 universities' worth of gap-year students at any given moment. If you want somewhere really unspoiled by progress, try Morecambe. Package holidays come in half board, full board or self-catering. Half board is where you eat giant breakfasts and steal half the buffet to tide you through to dinner; full board is where you rarely leave the hotel restaurant; and self-catering allows you to immerse yourself in the local culture and eat pizza for seven days. One week isn't long enough for a holiday because it takes two days to work out where everything is and another three to relax, then it's time to think about coming home. Two weeks is too long, because the restaurant repeats its menu, you've seen all the sights and you're tanned to a crisp. Ten days is the ideal length, but you're not going to get that unless you book a specialist one-to-one with Rupert."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
