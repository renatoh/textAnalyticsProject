It would be great if it could finish next week and we could go back to what it was like in that nice week in February after the bushfires and before the virus. The big, strange overwhelming energy (panic buying! fear! what\u2019s that cough mean?) of earlier weeks has given way to listlessness and ennui. The drama of the previous weeks now seems like the product of the virus\u2019s signature fever. Now it\u2019s harder to summon the animation to sob over the sourdough starter as you listen to the morning news. That is if you are still listening to the news. Sobbing and grief was real big March 2020 energy. We\u2019re in April, and different people now. Hello listlessness and lethargy. Iso life this week feels like those rainy childhood Sundays in the middle of winter: stuck indoors, nothing to look forward to, fighting with a sibling over a piece of Lego, the theme song of 60 Minutes with its ticking clock comes on \u2013 a sign that it\u2019s time to go to bed, another dreary week ahead of school, homework and sport. Loathed midweek nights of goosebump blue skin and skinned knees, playing netball games on asphalt courts in the rain. The weeks blur and you think nothing good or exciting will ever happen to you. Nothing fun is around the corner. This time will never end. This is your life. And so it is here. Telephone conversations that only two weeks ago were full of high drama, life-changing news (I\u2019ve lost my job! I\u2019m moving in with my boyfriend of two weeks!), and vulnerable, brave declarations of love and fear, have now all flat-lined to this: \u201cDid you go to the supermarket today?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cDid they have any toilet paper?\u201d \u201cNo, still none.\u201d Silence. The sound of someone stirring a pot of lentil soup. \u201cI should go.\u201d \u201cBut you have nowhere to go.\u201d \u201cI know, but I\u2019m going to hang up now.\u201d \u201cShould I go to the supermarket for some Doritos? Or is that dumb? But I really feel like Doritos. Do you think l\u2019ll get the covi? Imagine getting covi because Doritos.\u201d \u201cI gotta run.\u201d \u201cRun where? Should I get the Doritos?\u201d This is now every phone call ever. For those of us who are not homeschooling or essential workers, we have been given a surplus of something we\u2019ve always craved but have proven we don\u2019t know how to deal with: time. There\u2019s now so much time. But this gift comes with restrictions: we can\u2019t spend this time travelling or with friends, or in parks and beaches, or even with members of our family if we live apart. This is time to spend by ourselves, in our homes. This week the new smallness of life is truly beginning to sink in. The dominant mood is akin to that listless sensation you get from having spent too long on Instagram, scrolling. It\u2019s the feeling of being too full and too empty all at once. Of seeing too much and seeing nothing. It\u2019s not just the phone calls. It\u2019s the non-routine routine: getting up and then going back to bed, working in bed, working at night, sleeping in the day. It\u2019s the same avo-crusted leggings for a week straight. It\u2019s the Zoom drinks where your friends are now just a confusion of squares on a screen, talking over each other and dropping out. It\u2019s the matted hair and mellow carb highs. It\u2019s the glazed-eye nights on TikTok that end at 2am when your phone dies. Every now and then a panicked thought finds its way through the mush: when is this bit going to end, this endless rainy Sunday? At least, through some incredible miracle of the internet, we can get dispatches from the frontline of our future. Talking nightly to friends in other countries, where the virus is a couple of weeks ahead of us, they have travelled through the same emotional weather, albeit just a few miles up the road. Friends in London, Madrid, Barcelona and Rome had fear when we had complacency, anxiety when we had fear, grief when we had anxiety \u2013 and so forth. This week: a friend in Barcelona can\u2019t leave the house but says: \u201cI\u2019m fine actually. Cooking, reading, watching films and eating. It\u2019s not so bad actually when you know everyone else is in the same weird-ass boat.\u201d A friend in Madrid has little children who haven\u2019t left the apartment in two weeks. He is amazed and grateful for their resilience. Friends in Rome and northern Italy are using the time to cook increasingly elaborate meals. They sound resigned but also relaxed. The fear has gone from their voices. What these dispatches tell me is that the virus has forced us into a structure not of our choosing, but we just have to yield. This current listlessness will pass, and turn into something else. Ahead of us all is pain. But also maybe stillness, acceptance, tranquility and gratitude. The only way out is through. \u2022 Brigid Delaney is a Guardian Australia columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
