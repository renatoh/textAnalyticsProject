In addition, in a lengthy investigation it published on Friday, based in part on interviews with the alleged victim, her friends, the accused and fraternity members, the Washington Post reported that some \u201cclose friends\u201d of the woman in question, who are themselves advocates for victims of sexual assault, \u201csaid they believe something traumatic happened to [her] but have come to doubt her account\u201d and noted several other important problems with Rolling Stone\u2019s work. Rolling Stone\u2019s original article was an expose about rape at UVA that centered around the alleged gang rape of a first-year student, \u201cJackie,\u201d in an upstairs room of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house in 2012, and detailed how the administration failed, at several turns, to respond to the alleged incident. It garnered worldwide attention and prompted a swift response by the university and, reportedly, an investigation by local police. But the article, published amid national scrutiny of and a federal crackdown on the way colleges and universities handle sexual assault on campus, was also met with skepticism in parts of the media. In a statement published online on Friday, Rolling Stone\u2019s managing editor Will Dana wrote: \u201cIn the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie\u2019s account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced. We were trying to be sensitive to the unfair shame and humiliation many women feel after a sexual assault and now regret the decision to not contact the alleged assaulters to get their account. We are taking this seriously and apologize to anyone who was affected by the story.\u201d Responding on Twitter to the mounting criticism Friday afternoon, Dana said he found it \u201cdeeply unsettling\u201d that Rolling Stone published an article he didn\u2019t have \u201ccomplete confidence\u201d in, and that he couldn\u2019t explain the discrepancies between the reported story and the fraternity\u2019s statement. \u201cWe should have either not made this agreement with Jackie or worked harder to convince her that the truth would have been better served by getting the other side of the story. That failure is on us \u2013 not on her,\u201d he wrote. Some media critics had questioned the reporting methods, scrutinizing the degree to which the magazine relied on a single source, Jackie, and the reporter Sabrina Rubin Erdely\u2019s failure to contact the men accused of carrying out the attack. \u201cFor the sake of Rolling Stone\u2019s reputation, Sabrina Rubin Erdely had better be the country\u2019s greatest judge of character,\u201d the Washington Post\u2019s media critic, Erik Wemple, wrote on Tuesday. In the statement, Dana explained the magazine\u2019s editorial decision not to reach out to the accused. \u201cBecause of the sensitive nature of Jackie\u2019s story, we decided to honor her request not to contact the man she claimed orchestrated the attack on her nor any of the men she claimed participated in the attack for fear of retaliation against her,\u201d he wrote. Over the course of several interviews with the Washington Post, Jackie defended her version of events and recounted a similar story, the paper reports. According to the paper, she said had been invited to a date party by a member of the fraternity, was lured into a room by her date and was brutally attacked by seven men while two watched. \u201cI never asked for this,\u201d she told the Post. \u201cWhat bothers me is that so many people act like it didn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s my life. I have had to live with the fact that it happened every day for the last two years.\u201d The fraternity also released a statement Friday afternoon. In it, the fraternity denied having hosted \u201ca date function or a social event\u201d on the weekend in September of 2012 when the gang rape is alleged to have taken place, said that it would not have been initiating new members during the fall semester \u2013 the Rolling Stone story implied that the rape was an initiation ritual \u2013 and said \u201cno ritualized sexual assault is part of our pledging or initiation process,\u201d calling that a \u201cvile\u201d idea. The UVA chapter of Phi Kappa Psi has suspended all operations while the investigation takes place. The fraternity said it is assisting local police with the investigation. Charlottesville police captain Gary Pleasants said: \u201cOur purpose is to find the truth in any matter and that\u2019s what we are looking for here. These articles do not change our focus moving forward.\u201d The paper also reported that the name of one of the men Jackie alleges attacked her turned out to be similar to the name of a student who belonged to a different fraternity. This man, a UVA graduate, told the Post he had worked at the school\u2019s Aquatic and Fitness Center \u2013 a detail Jackie provided in her account of the alleged rape, and that Rolling Stone had published \u2013 but said he had never met Jackie in person and that he was not a member of Phi Kappa Psi. In its statement, the fraternity said none of its members had worked at the facility during the time period in question."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
