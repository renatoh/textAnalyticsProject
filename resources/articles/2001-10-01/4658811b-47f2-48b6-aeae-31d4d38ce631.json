He turned round to see the thief start driving off, but was near enough to grab the car and be dragged along until he was flung off, sustaining a broken bone in his wrist and twisted back muscles. The car has not been found. Mr Leeson was shocked when 13 weeks later, against the expectations of the police and the recommendation of the loss adjusters involved, his motor insurer Allianz Cornhill refused to pay up because of an exclusion in the policy: \"Loss of or damage to your car arising from theft, when ignition keys are left in or on your car\". \"I'm one of these strange people who always reads the small print in insurance policies, so I knew there could be a query over the claim because I wasn't sure exactly where the keys were at the time of the theft,\" Mr Neeson says. \"I had been cleaning the car with the keys in my tracksuit bottom and they must have fallen out, possibly when I got in and out of the car to get the toy duck. \"So I was absolutely honest with the insurer and said that they may either have been on a passenger seat or on the ground next to the car. But I felt that I had done nothing wrong and a lawyer friend suggested I took my complaint to the Financial Ombudsman who agreed to consider my case.\" Given the Ombudsman's recent stance on such cases, Mr Neeson is now hopeful of soon receiving a decision in his favour. His advice to anyone facing a similar refusal to pay out from an insurer is to keep on pursuing their claim. \"In my case, because of the amount of money involved, I had no choice but to continue with my claim. But if your claim is for only a smaller amount, at times it would be so easy to give up and let the big boy win. The message is not to give in,\" he says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
