Then add in factors missing in Scotland: a terrorist movement supported (to some extent) by 10% of the population; a local language used (unlike Gaelic) by 15-20%, but with a status out of all proportion to that; a history of civil war and dictatorship within living memory; and wealth greater than almost anywhere else in the country. That, very roughly, is the situation in Spain's autonomous Basque country, which yesterday appointed its first non-nationalist government of modern times. The new Basque president, Patxi L\u00f3pez, a Socialist, is a very brave man. His administration \u2013 which says it intends to unite a divided society \u2013 has been declared a target by Euskadi Ta Askatasuna, the movement that has killed more than 800 people (including journalists and academics) since it began its campaign of violence in the 1960s. He comes to power thanks to a remarkable informal coalition with the Partido Popular, conservatives who are at the same time fiercely opposed to the Socialist government in Madrid. Between them, the two parties won 38 seats in elections in March. The main Basque nationalist party won more seats than either of them, but not enough for a majority in the contest, from which smaller parties supportive of Eta were excluded. The appointment of the new government is a testing moment not just for Basques, but for all European nationalist movements, including those in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. It raises questions about who nationalism is supposed to serve: everyone who happens to live in autonomous regions, whatever their cultural or linguistic background (as the SNP hopes in Scotland), or a narrower and exclusive definition based on identity (the case in the Basque country). The large majority of the Basque population who speak only Castilian Spanish, and the large minority born outside its borders have not been well-served by 30 years of nationalist rule. Often, Basque nationalists have found themselves drawn to violent separatism, defined around an interpretation of culture and territory that lacks popular support. By contrast, their Catalan counterparts have led a peaceful search for increased autonomy. The return of democracy brought the Basque country greater autonomy than almost anywhere else on the planet that does not enjoy full independence \u2014 and yet Eta was not satisfied. It continued to kill. That tainted all Basque nationalists, including democratic ones. That is why they find themselves excluded from power by the proud and distinctive nation they claim to represent. The lesson: end the violence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
