At his final midnight Maga rally on Monday, Donald Trump promised his supporters \u201cone of the greatest wins in the history of politics.\u201d But while polls in the swing states may have tightened in recent days, they still showed Trump\u2019s Democratic rival, Joe Biden, ahead on election eve. The first big electoral college prize of the night is Florida, where the last polls close at 8pm east coast time, potentially indicating which way the national race will lean. But many believe the ultimate result could come down to a close-fought battle for Pennsylvania\u2019s 20 electoral college votes. And Trump voters at the president\u2019s last rally in Michigan warned Lois Beckett: \u201cThere\u2019s going to be violence either way.\u201d This election isn\u2019t about the next four years, says Bill McKibben. It\u2019s about the next four millennia: Time is the one thing we can\u2019t recover, and time is the one thing we\u2019ve just about run out of in the climate fight. How election night could turn into election week Trump reportedly intends to declare victory prematurely \u2013 and possibly falsely \u2013 if he appears to be ahead at any point on election night. And newsrooms across the US are preparing to counter the president\u2019s misinformation, for fear of facilitating his efforts to undermine the democratic process. If the results are close, then election night might instead become election week. Tom McCarthy outlines the key results and when to expect them, while Sam Levine asks the experts how a narrowly contested race could play out after Tuesday \u2013 particularly if it reaches the courts. In the meantime, you can follow all the Guardian\u2019s coverage of election day on our live blog. A referendum on the Trump presidency However much Trump tried to make the 2020 campaign about Joe Biden, it was always going to be a referendum on his own presidency. Unable to define his opponent, and unprepared to tackle the pandemic, Trump instead tried to replay his winning campaign of four years ago. It got him over the line then, writes David Smith \u2013 but will it be enough this time? Past incumbents have successfully made elections about not themselves but their opponents. George W Bush shifted the spotlight to challenger John Kerry. Barack Obama did likewise to Mitt Romney. But this president\u2019s profligate and shambolic campaign could neither escape the pandemic nor find a way to define Biden. It is still all about Trump. Twitter flagged a Trump tweet as misinformation on the last day of the campaign, after the president claimed a recent supreme court decision would lead to voter fraud. According to one veteran GOP campaign lawyer, systemic voter fraud is the GOP\u2019s \u201cLoch Ness Monster\u201d: \u201cPeople have spent a lot of time looking for it\u2026 but it doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d The president fears criminal prosecution, argues Samer S Shehata, and that\u2019s the real reason he\u2019s terrified of losing the presidency: If Trump loses the election, there may be calls to investigate and prosecute him for possible crimes involving obstruction of justice, violating the emolument clause of the constitution, and/or tax fraud, among others. What kind of president would Biden be? This election looks set to be the biggest betting event of all time, and Biden remains the clear favourite in the gambling markets, with one player placing a record-breaking \u00a31m bet on the Democratic challenger. For the latest Today in Focus podcast, Evan Osnos, author of a new Biden biography, tells Anushka Asthana what sort of president he might be. Biden said on Monday that it was \u201ctime to take back our democracy,\u201d while Trump went on making wild claims about a Biden presidency turning the US into \u201ca prison state.\u201d Even if Trump loses, argues Richard Sennett, the wounds of the last four years will take a long time to heal: After an election that Trump will probably lose, what worries me about the base is that it will shift towards the conspiracy theorists, armed vigilantes, a reborn Ku Klux Klan, because the aggressiveness of such groups can be counted on. Mainstream America will have turned against the real America. If this seems too extreme a prospect, you need only remember that in 2016 the accepted wisdom was that anyone like Trump could not possibly be elected. In other election news\u2026 A record number of women and women of color are on the ballot today, with 318 women from both major parties running for a seat in the House or Senate \u2013 up from the 2018 record of 257. Of that 318, 117 are women of color. Democrats need a net gain of four US senate seats to flip the upper chamber of Congress. Miranda Bryant lists the 10 closest senate races to keep an eye on tonight. America set a new record for daily coronavirus cases over the weekend, with infections surging by 10% in a week in Idaho. Trump meanwhile threatened to fire Anthony Fauci and falsely claimed at a Florida rally that \u201cdoctors get more money if someone dies from Covid.\u201d Stat of the day At least 97 million votes were already cast before election day. Of those, some 24 million were from people who didn\u2019t vote in 2016, while 8 million were from people voting for the first time. Guardian US data editor Mona Chalabi explains how these new voters and former non-voters could end up shaping the result. Don\u2019t miss this Republicans have spent more than a decade attempting to dismantle the Affordable Care Act \u2013 the healthcare law better known as Obamacare. And even if Trump loses the presidency on Tuesday, the US supreme court he has packed with conservatives could yet strike it down. Exactly one week after election day, the court \u2013 including its new Trump-nominated justice, Amy Coney Barrett \u2013 will hear a case that could result in 20 million Americans losing their insurance in the midst of a global pandemic.
