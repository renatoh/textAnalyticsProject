But 24 hours before the start of the US Open today, most bookmakers had barely taken a bean on the player bettors have relied on for a decade. The layers seemed happy to take Woods on. \"Bearing in mind Tiger Woods's comparatively average record on par-70 courses and the fact that he failed to feature in the Players Championship and the Memorial, we feel this is the time to get against the world No1,\" said Skybet's senior golf compiler, John Rhodes. However, the money started to come for Woods yesterday morning when William Hill chalked up 4-1 about the 2002 champion and promptly racked up \u00a3200,000 liabilities in less than a morning's trading, thus being forced to cut him to 3-1. There is still plenty of 7-2 available about Woods winning at Oakmont Country Club though, as layers look to balance their books. The biggest reason why the bookmakers are content to take money on Woods is the venue. The course is a brute. The greens are the fastest the players will encounter all year, the fairways narrow and the rough punishing. Paddy Power offers just 1-4 that the champion's total will be over par with Sporting Index quoting the winning score at 285-286 - five or six over. If punters need proof of how tough the Oakmont rough is, consider the fate of Phil Mickelson, now 14-1 with Totesport. The left-hander damaged a wrist practising shots out of the rough three weeks ago and has not played since. Otherwise Mickelson, under the tutelage of Woods's former coach, Butch Harmon, and striking the ball beautifully, would have had a great chance. Only the double Masters champion will know if his wrist can stand the pressure of playing, and so his price has drifted from 8-1 a month ago. Due to the lack of confidence in the top two in the world there has been support for a number of other players in the run-up to the first three-ball teeing off at midday today. Bear in mind most bookmakers are betting in-play on the outright market, so there is still time for punters. VC Bet has cut the price of Jim Furyk from a best -priced 22-1 into 16-1 after heavy early support. Coral still offers 18-1, which seems fair value about the 2003 champion who tied for second last year. Furyk, one of the straightest drivers on tour, was beaten in a play-off in the Crowne Plaza Invitational three weeks ago. David Toms is another straight driver and solid putter who has seen his odds shrink. The former USPGA winner is a general 50-1 shot having been double that a fortnight ago. Third place in the St Jude Championship last week suggests Toms, in the top 20 in three of his last four US Opens, could reward each-way support. Boyle Sports and Paddy Power's each-way terms are a quarter the odds and cover the first six players where most go first five. Scott Verplank, not the longest off the tee but usually on the fairways, is also worth an interest at a freely available 80-1 (Boyle's reports the Texan taking \u00a350,000 out of their book). A better option, though, is to sell his finishing position at 42 with Sporting Index. Verplank has three top-10 finishes in his last five starts including victory in the Byron Nelson Championship. The prospect of a first European winner of a US Open since 1970 looks as distant as ever, although VC Bet reports Justin Rose as \"our worst loser at the moment\" after laying the Englishman at 50-1: you cannot get bigger than 40-1 now. Ladbrokes have seen money for Luke Donald, although he is still freely available at 33-1; Hill's has liabilities about Sergio Garc\u00eda (33-1, general) and Colin Montgomerie (125-1, general), whereas Boyle's (\u00a330,000 liabilities) and Paddy Power report support for Padraig Harrington (28-1, general). Betfred offers 9-2 on any European winning and Skybet will lay you 14-1 that an Englishman will win. The \"top European\" market is perhaps best for punters who want to back a player from this side of the Atlantic. Harrington is the 6-1 (VC Bet) favourite with Donald 13-2, Garc\u00eda 7-1 and Henrik Stenson 9-1 (all general). Selections Jim Furyk each-way at 18-1. The 2003 champion is an accurate driver of the ball: crucial at Oakmont. (Coral) 2 star bet David Toms each-way at 50-1. Back the 40-year-old to finish in the top six (Boyle Sports and Paddy Power) 1 star bet Sell Scott Verplank's finishing position at 42 with his form indicating he can do far better (Sporting Index) 1 star bet"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
