Top stories A week of crippling internal fighting on energy policy has triggered a nosedive in the polls for the Coalition, encouraging further speculation that a leadership challenge by Peter Dutton is imminent. The Coalition\u2019s primary vote dropped dramatically in the latest Ipsos poll, released on Sunday night, leaving Labor with a 55%-45% two-party-preferred lead that would return it to government in a landslide if repeated at the federal election. Close Malcolm Turnbull ally Christopher Pyne remained upbeat on Sunday, maintaining the government had \u201cthe right policy mix and if we are united we will win the next election\u201d, but the minister for defence industry did concede: \u201cThere are some people who don\u2019t support the current leader and that is quite obvious.\u201d Donald Trump has invoked the memories of Richard Nixon and Joseph McCarthy in a frenzied attack on the New York Times, after a report detailed White House counsel Don McGahn\u2019s extensive cooperation with the Mueller investigation into possible Russian election interference. Trump claimed he \u201callowed\u201d the meeting, but the Times suggested it was motivated by fear on McGahn\u2019s part of becoming a scapegoat for the president. Meanwhile Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani has broken new rhetorical ground in defending the president\u2019s failure to agree to be interviewed by Mueller, declaring on NBC that \u201ctruth isn\u2019t truth\u201d. More than two million people have left Venezuela since 2015 in one of the largest mass migrations in Latin American history, the United Nations has reported, with many now facing persecution and discrimination in neighbouring countries. Almost 50,000 people left in the last fortnight alone. President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has called the emigrants \u201cslaves and beggars\u201d for leaving the country in search of \u201cthe honeys\u201d of affluence. Several countries are now closing their borders to fleeing Venezuelans. Water levels are falling and rains have been predicted to ease in India\u2019s monsoon-ravaged province of Kerala, where flooding has killed more than 370 people. At least 83,000km of roads will need repairing, the state\u2019s chief minister has said, and about 20,000 homes and 40,000 hectares of crops are believed to have been destroyed. The armed forces reported that 23,213 people had been rescued in recent days. The remains of 60 Aboriginal people have been reinterred after the 2017 floods that destroyed the Fitzroy Crossing cemetery in Western Australia. Working in 40C heat, volunteers coordinated by the Fitzroy Men\u2019s Shed spent three months exhuming exposed bodies. Elders said the project was an important step for reconciliation and truth-telling about the impact of colonisation in the Kimberley. Sport Manchester United have conceded three goals in a first half for the first time since 2015, as the 12-time Premier League winners slumped to a remarkable 3-2 defeat at Mat Ryan\u2019s Brighton. It was a less enjoyable day for fellow Socceroo Aaron Mooy, as Huddersfield capitulated 6-1 to a Sergio Ag\u00fcero-led Manchester City. Australian rugby is in crisis. That\u2019s the takeaway from the disastrous 38-13 defeat to the All Blacks, which left the Wallabies on the brink of their 16th consecutive Bledisloe Cup loss, writes Bret Harris. \u201cThe most alarming aspect of the Wallabies\u2019 performance against the All Blacks was not the disintegration of their set-pieces ... but the absence of vision and ambition in their game-plan.\u201d Thinking time The community of Xolobeni on South Africa\u2019s stunning Wild Coast has fought a titanium dune mine proposed by an Australian company for nearly 20 years. Photojournalist Thom Pierce captured their largely self-sufficient lifestyle, mostly built around fishing, but residents fear the granting of a mining licence would change their way of life irrevocably. The classic Deborra-Lee Furness movie Shame, now restored and streaming on SBS On Demand, is a rare exception to the prurience and titillation of the rape-revenge sub-genre, writes Jenny Valentish. \u201cShame completely rejects the male gaze and doesn\u2019t even depict the gang rape at the centre of the plot,\u201d writes Valentish. But, \u201cWhat\u2019s depressing about Shame, 30 years on, is that its portrayal of the darker side of Australian masculinity is as relevant as ever.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s literally my job to eat as widely as possible so I can write about the food world,\u201d says food and travel writer Melissa Leong. \u201cFrom street food stands to the world\u2019s fanciest food temples, there\u2019s nothing I won\u2019t eat and, in the words of the late, great Anthony Bourdain, \u2018I\u2019m hungry for more.\u2019\u201d But how to reconcile the demands of the job with the needs of one\u2019s own body, in an industry anchored in hedonism? Media roundup The Australian, the Financial Review, the Daily Telegraph and Fairfax mastheads all lead with the leadership crisis engulfing Malcolm Turnbull, amid furious last-minute negotiations around energy policy and talk of a possible challenge from Peter Dutton. South Australian paramedics are at breaking point, the Adelaide Advertiser reports, with a Senate submission detailing 73 recorded incidents of high stress, fatigue or threats of violence on the job during the first half of 2018. And the Mercury leads with the remarkable rise from financial basketcase of basketball\u2019s Hobart Chargers.
