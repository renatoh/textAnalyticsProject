Barkham\u2019s depictions of the landscapes and wildlife are beautifully evocative. His encounters with people are just as engaging, as he discovers what it is like to be an islander. Throughout, he weaves the story of Whiskey Galore! author Compton Mackenzie and his obsession with living on smaller and smaller islands. \u2022 Read The Guardian review The Rule of the Land: Walking Ireland\u2019s Border by Garrett Carr (Faber) In a timely account, Northern Irish writer and map-maker Garrett Carr walks \u2013 and sometimes canoes \u2013 along what looks set to be the new frontier between the UK and the EU. With perceptive humour and warmth, Carr teases out stories from northerners and southerners, and adds a rich historical context. What he uncovers is not only the lives of people of the north and the south but also a separate tribe \u2013 the border people themselves \u2013 whose viewpoints set them apart from their neighbours. \u2022 garrettcarr.net The Epic City: The World on the Streets of Calcutta by Kushanava Choudhury (Bloomsbury) After moving back and forth from Kolkata to New Jersey, where his parents had emigrated, Kushanava Choudhury is drawn back to the former capital of the British Raj to live permanently. In this, his first book, Choudhury doesn\u2019t romanticise this city that enchants as much as it infuriates, preferring to reveal its grittiness. What\u2019s especially poignant is how he portrays the slow disintegration of his family\u2019s heritage in the city, as fewer members feel compelled to stay. It\u2019s in parallel with the changes in Kolkata as high-rise complexes take over historic districts. \u2022 Read The Guardian review Where the Wild Winds Are: Walking Europe\u2019s Winds from the Pennines to Provence by Nick Hunt (Nicholas Brealey) A 2014 Stanford Dolman finalist with his account of following in Patrick Leigh Fermor\u2019s footsteps, Nick Hunt again walks through Europe but this time uses the continent\u2019s four winds as his guide. He chases the helm in Cross Fell, the bora (or bura) in Trieste and Croatia, the foehn in Switzerland and Provence\u2019s mistral. In a testament to his skill as a writer, Hunt manages to keep up a cracking pace even when the winds decide not to make an appearance. \u2022 \u2018The wind makes Karst people stay in, and gives them character\u2019: Nick Hunt interview Risingtidefallingstar by Philip Hoare (Fourth Estate) Philip Hoare has turned his fixation with the sea into an elegantly written book that combines travelogue with stories of other writers and poets \u2013 Shakespeare, Melville, Thoreau, Woolf, Byron, Shelley, Plath, among others \u2013 who had shown a fascination with water. (The chapter on Wilfred Owen stands out in particular.) Some of the characters he meets along the way are just as fascinating, notably his Cape Cod artist landlady whose grandparents were on the Titanic and whose social circle included Truman Capote, Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko. \u2022 Read The Guardian review Travels in a Dervish Cloak by Isambard Wilkinson (Eland) As a teenager, Isambard Wilkinson visited Pakistan after being raised on tales of the country by his Anglo-Indian grandmother. He was able to return as the Daily Telegraph\u2019s correspondent in 2006, and his exuberant, amusing and warm-hearted observations of a country he clearly adores go well beyond that of a typical foreign correspondent. His accounts range from meeting feudal warlords and reporting on Islamist bombings to visiting Sufi shrines and trying to control a chaotic household. \u2022 10 of the best travel books \u2026 for National Read a Book Day And the winner \u2026 Border: A Journey to the Edge of Europe by Kapka Kassabova (Granta) Bulgarian-born writer and poet Kapka Kassabova dexterously unpeels layer after layer of history in a highly fraught part of Europe that, as with Garrett Carr\u2019s The Rule of the Land, has become topical once again. She crisscrosses the triangle of borders between Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey, starting in Bulgaria where, during her communist childhood, East Germans holidaying in Black Sea resorts unwittingly used deliberately misleading maps to try to flee through the forest and beyond the iron curtain. Now she sees Syrian refugees heading from south to north: \u201cThis was a year when refugees still came across the border in twos, rather than in hundreds and thousands.\u201d Driving through mountain villages, Kassabova shows herself to be a master storyteller in her encounters with the dwindling number of people left behind \u2013 among them border guards whose job it had been to shoot escaping Czechs, Poles and East Germans. In this region of complex ethnicities, Kassabova is adept at unravelling the convoluted histories of the many population exchanges that have taken place since the collapse of the Ottoman empire and during the Balkan wars of 1912-13. Kassabova combines a dry, dark humour with compassion as she tracks down people who ended up on the wrong side of the barbed-wire fence. As a Bulgarian who ended up in Scotland via New Zealand, Kassabova is one to know about the dangers of nationalism along what she calls the \u201clast border in Europe\u201d. \u2022 Read The Guardian review The judging panel for the Stanford Dolman Travel Book of the Year: Sara Wheeler (chair), Helena Drysdale, Jason Goodwin, Michael Kerr, Victoria Mather, Samantha Weinberg and Mary Novakovich \u2022 To buy the titles featured in this article visit the guardian bookshop or call on 0330 333 6846"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
