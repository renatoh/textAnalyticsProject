AQA, the exam board, confirmed the theft of a Parcelforce van containing exam papers for a number of different subjects, leading it to produce replacement papers to guard against the possibility of fraud. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to indicate that [the van] was targeted for the papers or that any of them have come to light. However, we don\u2019t leave anything to chance, so as soon as we knew about it, we contacted our senior examiners and asked them to write some brand-new papers,\u201d an AQA spokesman said. \u201cThese are now going out to schools. There\u2019s nothing for students to worry about \u2013 they should carry on with their exam preparation as normal, and when they turn up on the day of the exam, they won\u2019t notice anything different.\u201d This year\u2019s theft is one of a series to have bedevilled exam boards in recent years, although AQA appears to be worst hit. In 2008 AQA said it reset 40 papers in 15 subjects after a Parcelforce van in Hertfordshire was stolen. In 2005 the same board had to replace half a million exam papers after another Parcelforce van was stolen. In 2004 a further Parcelforce van was taken at knifepoint in Mitcham, south London, containing papers for GCSE English literature, geography, German and Spanish exams, later found scattered in Croydon. And in 2003, AQA had to reset and print 1.5m English and English literature papers after a Parcelforce van was stolen. The news came on the same day that AQA suffered mild embarrassment when it was revealed that a question in its A-level physics paper sat by pupils contained an error. The question, worth three marks, should have asked candidates to compare a 150 k\u03a9 resistor \u2013 not a 150 \u03a9 resistor as it said in the paper - to a 300 k\u03a9 resistor. A teacher who contacted the Guardian said: \u201cOne half of it has the measurements 1,000 times greater than the other half \u2013 ohms vs kilo-ohms \u2013 making drawing the correct graph as the question is printed totally impossible. I\u2019m sure they will deal with it in the marking, but it\u2019s about the effects on the confidence of the students.\u201d AQA\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cThe question can still be answered and four schools have been in touch, out of a total of around 1200. At this stage it looks as though most students haven\u2019t been affected by this, but we\u2019re letting our examiners know and will make sure it doesn\u2019t affect students\u2019 grades.\u201d AQA\u2019s A-level physics paper was not one of those in the stolen van, the spokesman said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
