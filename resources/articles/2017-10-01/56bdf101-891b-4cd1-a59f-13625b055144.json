Unsworth, Everton\u2019s academy and under-23s manager, has taken temporary charge at Goodison Park for a second time following the Dutchman\u2019s dismissal. The 44-year-old has confirmed he wants the job and had a lengthy meeting with Bill Kenwright following Koeman\u2019s departure on Monday. No timeframe has been placed on Unsworth\u2019s caretaker role, though he discussed \u201chow many games, players, short- and long-term plans\u201d with the Everton chairman and wants an extended opportunity to press his claims. Everton are expected to give their former defender until the international break to demonstrate the coaching and motivational skills that have impressed the Goodison hierarchy, a spell of four games that commences with Wednesday\u2019s visit to Chelsea in the Carabao Cup. Unsworth said: \u201cI\u2019m very close to the chairman anyway and we had a great chat, although he wasn\u2019t happy he\u2019d had to release Ronald from his contract. That was tough for him. He just said he wants me to take the team. There\u2019s no timescale. We\u2019ll keep communicating and take it from there, week by week. I would like a run at it but, like anything, results will dictate how long you get. Results and performances will determine how long I stay in the seat. I\u2019m OK with that.\u201d Beni Baningime and David Henen, two of Unsworth\u2019s under-23 players, have been called into the squad for the game at Chelsea. The under-23s coach John Ebbrell will assist at Stamford Bridge. The first-team coach Duncan Ferguson has survived the cull of Koeman\u2019s backroom staff. Alan Kelly, Unsworth\u2019s former colleague at Preston North End, has arrived as a goalkeeping coach. Although Unsworth lacks the Premier League experience of Sean Dyche or the European profile of Thomas Tuchel, two candidates for the Everton job, he says the main criteria is clear with the club third from bottom of the Premier League. \u201cThe club needs a winning manager,\u201d said Unsworth, who also has a close relationship with the director of football, Steve Walsh, dating back to Lancashire Under-15s. \u201cWhoever gets it must win. I know Farhad [Moshiri, Everton\u2019s major shareholder], Bill and the board want a winning manager. If you win you keep your job.\u201d Unsworth held out an olive branch to Ross Barkley, who had fallen out of favour under Koeman and almost joined Chelsea in the summer having declined a new contract. \u201cI would absolutely love Ross to stay,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is a top talent. Everton has done great for him and he has done great for Everton. He could one of the all-time greats here. I would love him to be persuaded by myself and the chairman to stay and sign a contract. We shouldn\u2019t be losing players of his quality. I feel very strongly we shouldn\u2019t be losing our own.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
