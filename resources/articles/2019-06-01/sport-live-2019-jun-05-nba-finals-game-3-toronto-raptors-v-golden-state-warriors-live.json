The post-game press conference is under way. You can follow along here. Some notes off tonight\u2019s game: \u2022 The Raptors have won at least one road game in each of their four playoff series in the 2019 postseason. \u2022 Golden State\u2019s Stephen Curry scored a playoff career-high 47 points. His previous postseason high was 44 points against the San Antonio Spurs on 6 May 2013. \u2022 Curry finished with the eighth-highest-scoring game in NBA finals history. \u2022 Toronto made 17 three-pointers. The only teams to make more three-pointers in an NBA finals game are the Cleveland Cavaliers (24 on 9 June 2017) and the Warriors (18 on 4 June 2017). \u2022 The Warriors used their 10th different starting lineup of the 2019 playoffs, the most in a single postseason since starters and reserves began being tracked in the 1970-71 season. \u2022 The Raptors\u2019 Kawhi Leonard (30 points) recorded his 13th game with at least 30 points in the 2019 playoffs. The only players to have that many 30-point games in a single postseason are Michael Jordan (four times), Hakeem Olajuwon, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant (two times) and LeBron James (two times). \u2022 Klay Thompson\u2019s streak of consecutive playoff games played ended at 120. It had been the NBA\u2019s second-longest current streak behind LeBron James\u2019 239 straight playoff games. \u2022 Kyle Lowry broke Toronto\u2019s franchise record for career field goals made in the playoffs, surpassing DeMar DeRozan (397). Lowry has made 398 field goals with the Raptors. \u2022 The Raptors\u2019 Danny Green moved into ninth place on the NBA\u2019s career list for NBA finals three-pointers, passing Michael Jordan and Manu Ginobili (42 finals threes each). Green now has 47 finals three-pointers. \u2022 Toronto\u2019s Fred VanVleet (11 points) came off the bench to score in double figures for the sixth straight game. He is averaging 15.2 points in those six games. The Raptors led almost the entire way in a 123-109 victory to take a two-games-to-one lead in the NBA finals, overcoming an extraordinary 47-point effort by Stephen Curry. \u201cThey\u2019re the defending champs, they\u2019re never gonna make anything easy,\u201d says Kyle Lowry, who finished with 23 points and nine assists. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to continue to work, play hard and stay level-headed.\u201d Toronto\u2019s 123 points are the most the Warriors have surrendered at home in an NBA finals game under Steve Kerr. The Raptors have won six of their last seven games from when they trailed 0-2 in the Eastern Conference finals. They improve to 4-1 against the Warriors this season ... no matter who is playing. Raptors 118-105 Warriors, 1:37 4th quarter The Warriors have showed grit over the last two minutes to force the Raptors to close, but VanVleet\u2019s desperation 28-foot rainbow over the outstretched arm of Draymond Green with the shotclock expiring will be curtains. Kerr calls timeout and concedes, inserting Jacob Evans, Damian Jones and Jordan Bell for Curry, Green and Bogut. Raptors 113-103 Warriors, 3:27 4th quarter Curry lunges for a steal and Green fouls him while he\u2019s on the ground. Not a wise foul to put Golden State in the penalty. Curry hits them both to cut the lead to 10. He\u2019s got 47 points, a career playoff high. Raptors 113-101 Warriors, 3:47 4th quarter A quick 7-2 burst by Golden State cuts the lead to 12 points. Do the Warriors have one more push left in them? Raptors 111-94 Warriors, 5:41 4th quarter Those are \u201cLet\u2019s go Raptors!\u201d chants you\u2019re hearing at Oracle Arena. Raptors 107-91 Warriors, 6:48 4th quarter Curry scores his 44th and 45th points on a pull-up, but Toronto answers with seven quick points on a Lowry three, Ibaka jumper and Lowry jumper to match the largest lead of the game at 16 points. Raptors in total command here. Raptors 100-89 Warriors, 9:21 4th quarter Curry drains three free throws to cut the lead to seven, but Ibaka responds with a pair of baskets to quiet the crowd and restore the double-digit lead. Toronto coach Nick Nurse gets a quick timeout. Raptors 96-83 Warriors, end of 3rd quarter A roller-coaster third quarter ends with the Raptors leading by 13 points thanks in large part to Danny Green, who has poured in 18 points on 6-for-8 shooting, all from beyond the arc. Curry continues to light it up for the Warriors with 40 points on 13-for-26 shooting. It\u2019s the most he\u2019s ever scored in an NBA finals game ... and there\u2019s still an entire quarter to go. Meanwhile, it looks like Andrew Bogut has just walked to the locker room with head trainer Rick Celebrini. Raptors 89-75 Warriors, 1:33 3rd quarter Bogut deposits a pair of interior baskets out of the timeout to cut it to 83-75, but Danny Green answers with a three to extend it to double digits. The Raptors continue to keep the Warriors at arm\u2019s length. Now Green hits another three-pointer and Toronto\u2019s 14-point cushion matches the largest lead of the game. A smattering of boos from Oracle Arena crowd. Raptors 83-71 Warriors, 3:23 3rd quarter The Warriors cut the lead to seven on a rough-and-tumble transition lay-up by Draymond Green, but VanVleet drains a long two with a seven-footer in his face to extend it to 80-71 \u2013 then Kawhi cans a three-pointer on the following possession off a Siakam assist to open the lead back up to 12. Raptors 73-65 Warriors, 6:30 3rd quarter Six quick points by the Raptors to open the third quarter and all of a sudden the Warriors are trailing by 14. But they put together a few tight defensive possessions mixed in with baskets from Curry and Iguodala to cut it to seven. Curry has been unconscious all night with a game-high 32 points on 10-for-20 from the field, marking his ninth career NBA finals game with 30 or more points. Raptors 60-52 Warriors, start of 3rd quarter Starters back in. We\u2019re off and running in the third quarter. Lil Pump is your half-time entertainment. ESSKEETIT! Toronto\u2019s starters are back in with 3:13 to go. A crucial stretch from here until intermission. Lowry\u2019s three-pointer to make it 55-42 ends a scoring drought of nearly five minutes for Toronto, but Curry answers with a pair of free throws followed by a 30-footer to close the lead to 55-47. The Golden State defense has cranked it up over the last few minutes. They\u2019re making all the rotations, contesting shots, drawing charges and, crucially, challenging Leonard\u2019s handle and forcing him into turnovers. A big three-pointer by Lowry, his third of the night, makes it 58-58 with 33.9 seconds to go, but he picks up his third foul on the other end to send Curry to the line (who makes both). A quick exchange of baskets takes us into half-time with Toronto holding an eight-point edge. Curry has scored 25 points (on 7-for-13 from the floor) with seven rebounds and four assists so far. He finished with 23 points (on 6-for-17 shooting) with seven rebounds and four assists in all of Game 2. Here\u2019s a look at the full half-time box score. Raptors 52-40 Warriors, 4:20 2nd quarter The Warriors are shooting 37.1% from the floor \u2013 or 33% if you take away Curry\u2019s 6-for-12 \u2013 as America\u2019s First Couple watch from the front row. But the Raptors may be missing an opportunity to blow it open a bit as they\u2019ve gone scoreless over the last three minutes. Raptors 52-38 Warriors, 6:28 2nd quarter The Raptors are starting to open it up a bit and the crowd is getting restless. The hallmark switchability of the Golden State defense has been dramatically compromised by the injuries to Thompson, Durant and Looney. Curry is already doing more than his share on offense and the Warriors are still down by 14. Siakam is leading the way with 14 points for Toronto, but all five Raptors starters have at least two field goals midway through the second frame. Raptors 45-33 Warriors, 9:42 2nd quarter Kerr is going to give Curry a puff to start the second quarter. Livingston, Iguodala, Jerebko, Cousins and Cook are on the floor. Not a Golden State combo that we\u2019re used to seeing at any point, let alone Game 3 of the NBA finals. The Warriors quickly go minus-5 with Curry and Kerr gets a timeout. Curry will be re-entering. Siakam has six points already this quarter and team-high 12 points, two rebounds and two assists on the night. Raptors 36-29 Warriors, end of 1st quartrer McKinnie, Cook, Bogut, Curry and Draymond on the floor for the Warriors after the timeout. McCaw, Green and Ibaka are in for Siakam, Gasol and Lowry. The dormant crowd comes alive on back-to-back baskets by McKinnie and Cook, but Leonard is starting to make his presence felt with four free throws followed by a three-point play on a baseline dunk that makes it 33-23. Draymond responds with a three-point play and Curry drains a 32-footer to cut it to six, but Danny Green hits from downtown on the other end to end the opening frame. And what a first quarter it was for Stephen Curry, who already logged 17 points, six rebounds and three assists so far. He scored or assisted on the Warriors\u2019 first eight baskets. Curry\u2019s 17 points are tied for the most in the first quarter of an NBA finals game by any player in the last 20 years. Raptors 26-16 Warriors, 2:13 1st quarter Siakam hits from outside to extend a run of eight unanswered points for the Raptors. That\u2019s six straight games where the Warriors have fallen behind by double digits in the first half. The teams trade baskets and Kerr makes the first substitution with Andrew Bogut and Quinn Cook coming in for DeMarcus Cousins and Shaun Livingston. Curry continues to fill it up but the Raptors continue to answer on the other end. Bogut\u2019s lay-up to make it 24-16 at the 4:14 mark is Golden State\u2019s first non-Curry basket of the night. A Gasol dunk extends the Toronto lead to double digits at the under-four TV timeout. Raptors 15-7 Warriors, 7:37 1st quarter And we\u2019re off! Curry gets a couple of open looks early and scores the first five points of the game for the Warriors, including an unassisted 30-footer. But all five starters have already scored for the Raptors, who have made five of their first eight shots to take an early eight-point lead. Curry is 2-for-4, while the rest of the Warriors are 0-for-4. It\u2019s national anthem time at Oracle Arena. Not much longer now. Country artist Tenille Arts is performing O Canada, while Metallica\u2019s James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett are playing the Star-Spangled Banner. The officials for Game 3 are Marc Davis, David Guthrie and Kane Fitzgerald. Sean Wright is the alternate official. Eric Lewis is the official in the NBA Replay Center. Teams that win Game 3 when the NBA finals is tied at one win apiece have a 31-7 series record (.816). NBA TV\u2019s Jared Greenberg reports that Klay Thompson won\u2019t be playing in tonight\u2019s Game 3. That leaves the Warriors even more undermanned with Kevin Durant and Kevon Looney already sidelined. The Warriors are departing Oakland after this season for a new $1bn arena across the bay in San Francisco. Our Vivian Ho and Gabrielle Canon took a look at what the move will mean for the city in the long term, while Golden State coach Steve Kerr spoke before tonight\u2019s game about what he expects from the home crowd in the final two (or three) games here. \u201cI expect our crowd to be loud tonight and energetic,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI think they know that we need them more than ever, given our injury situation. And this has always been an unbelievable home\u2013court advantage, so I expect a rowdy crowd tonight and whatever day the next game is. Every day\u2019s Wednesday; that\u2019s what they say in the NBA. It is Wednesday. Who knew?\u201d Toronto coach Nick Nurse said the uncertainty around Klay Thompson\u2019s status doesn\u2019t affect his team\u2019s game-planning or preparation very much. \u201cI think we\u2019re at the point of this series where we got to get out and guard these dudes, whoever\u2019s out there,\u201d Nurse said during his pre-game availability. \u201cWe got to get playing our defense, quit worrying so much about special plays, this, that, and the other thing. We need to get into the ball. When you\u2019re guarding it, be great at guarding the ball; when your man doesn\u2019t have it, help, make the rotations; if somebody goes to help, help the helper. Fly out at shooters and block out. We got to do a better job of that if we want to win.\u201d Hello and welcome to Oracle Arena for Game 3 of the NBA finals between the Raptors and Warriors. The series is knotted at one game apiece ahead of tonight\u2019s return to Oakland and all eyes are on All-Star swingman Klay Thompson and whether he\u2019ll be available for Golden State after being forced out of Game 2 with a hamstring strain. Thompson is listed as questionable and Warriors coach Steve Kerr re-affirmed moments ago that he will be a game-time decision for a team already down Kevin Durant and Kevon Looney. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how he\u2019s feeling,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do the smart thing, too. It\u2019s still early in the series and if there\u2019s any pain, any discomfort, any risk, then he\u2019ll sit out.\u201d Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s Oliver Connolly\u2019s look back at Toronto\u2019s missed chance to take a commanding series lead in Sunday\u2019s Game 2."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
