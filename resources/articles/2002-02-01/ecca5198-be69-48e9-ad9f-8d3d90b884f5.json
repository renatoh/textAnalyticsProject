The east London club are putting the finishing touches to the new offer after appointing Roeder as manager, much to everyone's surprise, following the departure of Harry Redknapp last summer. The former reserve-team manager was originally handed a one-year contract but has impressed enough to warrant a deal which will keep him at the club until 2005. \"We're in advanced state of negotiations,\" said West Ham's managing director Paul Aldridge. \"Hopefully every thing will be settled within the next week or so.\" Roeder, a former Gillingham and Watford manager, was expected by many to become one of the first managerial casualties of the season. And after the Hammers failed to win any of their opening four games, then lost 5-0 to Everton and 7-1 at Blackburn in successive weeks, there were calls for him to go However last Saturday's home win against Blackburn lifted them to 11th in the table - even though they are only six points off the relegation zone - and tomorrow evening they entertain Chelsea in an FA Cup fourth-round replay.

A related programme may still get the go-ahead as Channel 4 continues talks. The plan was for a panel of fans to select three players to be dropped, with the manager Paul Fairclough naming three replacements and viewers phoning to register their votes. \"We do not consider that the best interests of all 22 member clubs would be served if we allowed this proposal to go ahead,\" a Conference spokesman said. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
