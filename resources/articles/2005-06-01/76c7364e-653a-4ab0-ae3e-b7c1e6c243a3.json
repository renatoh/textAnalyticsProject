HMV, owner of the eponymous music shops as well as bookseller Waterstone's, is hoping new albums, DVD blockbusters and the launch of gaming consoles will bring shoppers through the doors. Over the past few weeks the company has seen growth in sales, on a comparative basis, in Waterstone's and HMV. In music, the company has benefited from Coldplay's new album X&amp;Y, and new releases from Gorillaz, the White Stripes and Black Eyed Peas. Waterstone's, meanwhile, has seen holiday book buying and a better crop of new novels. Mr Giles said this weekend's Live8 festival could provide \"a shot in the arm\" for the music industry. But, he added, longer term growth depends on consumer confidence, which is still languishing in the doldrums. The company, which yesterday reported a 10% rise in profits for the year to the end of April to \u00a3129m, makes a third of its sales from impulse buying, where people wander into its stores looking for one item and leave with several others. For instance, next month's release of the latest Harry Potter book - Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - will not make the company a lot of money because the price has been heavily discounted, but it will increase footfall. Over the next few months the company is hoping music releases from artists like Franz Ferdinand and the Streets, and blockbuster films on DVD such as Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and Sin City will improve sales. September's release of PlayStation's portable console and a new XBox console in time for Christmas should also improve computer game sales. HMV announced yesterday it will launch its digital music downloading site, which has been developed with Microsoft, in September. The group also confirmed that Brian McLaughlin, the chief operating officer and acting managing director of Waterstone's, will retire at the end of the year and become a non-executive director."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
