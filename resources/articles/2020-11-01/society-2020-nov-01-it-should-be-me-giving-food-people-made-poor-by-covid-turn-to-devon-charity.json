Out of 130 people who approached the Devon-based hub for food support between March and September, 110 had never previously needed charity food help. \u201cI\u2019m seeing people dropping into poverty because Covid hit, and they suddenly realise they don\u2019t have any reserves,\u201d says West-Harling. Many are young families \u201cup to their neck in debt,\u201d she says, people who have taken advantage of easy credit or over-extended to get on the housing ladder. \u201cIf you are on the minimum wage and 20% goes [under furlough] you still have bills and debts. Many can\u2019t afford to feed themselves.\u201d It is not only the young who have suffered. West-Harling originally set up the hub, a not-for-profit company, to provide a nutritious meals-on-wheels style service for isolated older people in the county. Many of them, sometimes living in draughty old houses in lonely \u201cgenteel\u201d poverty, have struggled under Covid. Self-employed people, often running their own businesses, have found themselves in unexpected hardship and feel acute shame about relying on charity, says West-Harling. \u201cI delivered food round to a chap who owned a tool repair business. He was devastated, saying: \u2018I should be the one taking food round to people.\u2019\u201d In one case, they took food to a vulnerable young woman who was stranded alone in rural isolation. She had been too scared to leave her house during the pandemic. \u201cShe eventually phoned in terrible distress as she had not eaten in three days and had eked out what little food she had over a period of weeks.\u201d West-Harling, who founded and runs the Ashburton cookery school, says Covid has highlighted hidden areas of rural deprivation in Devon as well as the fragility of the tourism-farming-hospitality economy. The hub has been supported well by local volunteers and food banks, but needs financial help to keep going. It is a shame the UK has never eradicated food poverty, she says, though she believes there will always be people who need help. \u201cThe way forward is a compassionate society. You cannot deal with poverty, social isolation and loneliness without compassion.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
