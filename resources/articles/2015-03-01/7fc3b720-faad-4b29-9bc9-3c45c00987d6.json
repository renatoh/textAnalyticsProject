The chairman of Fairfax Media, Roger Corbett, also a member of the reserve bank, said that the government must work on its public image of unity following a series of damaging leaks against prime minister Tony Abbott and his office. \u201cThe perception is, for one reason or another, that that team is not working as effectively as it might together,\u201d Corbett told ABC TV last night. \u201cThis leak is another example of that. It\u2019s terribly important that the PM move [to fix these issues].\u201d Corbett says that the leaks disturb him. \u201cThe integrity of government, the way ministers and the prime minister inter-react together are vital in terms of the governance of Australia, the performance and I think the public is very aware of these relationships,\u201d he said. He warned that the perception of disunity in the ministry and impressions of discord between ministers and Abbott\u2019s chief of staff Peta Credlin, are contributing to poor economic growth. \u201cOur measures of confidence in the business community are lower than they could be and certainly our political challenges are one of those factors,\u201d Corbett said. \u201cHe needs to move to fix it. Because if there is a problem there, very clearly if it\u2019s not fixed it will continue to fester for the future.\u201d He said investment outside the resources sector is lagging. \u201cThat\u2019s why decisive, ongoing leadership by the prime minister in addressing these issues are going to be so important for Australia now, but Australia for the future,\u201d Corbett said. \u201cI think the government will need to have the fortitude to level with the Australian people and tell the public that revenue must increase if we want to maintain the standards of health and other services, and infrastructure in particular, in Australia\u201d Corbett said all political parties should think hard before making commitments to the public. \u201cI think broken promises \u2026 are extremely costly to confidence.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
