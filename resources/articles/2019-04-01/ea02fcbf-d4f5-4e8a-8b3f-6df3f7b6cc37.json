Top stories The Coalition has narrowed the gap to Labor in the latest Newspoll, which gives the opposition a 51%-49% lead, two-party-preferred. The two party leaders head to Perth for their first debate this evening, as pre-poll voting opens and the campaigns move into top gear with three weeks to go. The Australian Conservation Foundation is less impressed with the Coalition, giving it a miserable 4/100 on its climate change policy scorecard, which notes it has made \u201cpiecemeal promises for pumped hydro storage\u201d but has no plan to lift renewable energy above 23%. The scorecard rates Labor much higher, on 56%, but says it is held back by \u201cfairly weak\u201d policies on stopping the burning of coal and an \u201cunclear\u201d position on Adani\u2019s Carmichael coalmine. In other election news, at least 19 United Australia party candidates have submitted incomplete or inconsistent information to the Australian Electoral Commission, failing to provide evidence they are eligible to run for parliament. The liquor, hotels and gaming lobby made its highest level of donations in seven years in 2017-18, pumping more than $1m into the Liberal, Labor and far-right parties. Harm-reduction groups have renewed their calls for the industry to be banned from making federal donations, saying the money is warping policy and being used to thwart tax and advertising reform. The Australian Hotels Association gave $1,013,625 in donations across the political spectrum in 2017-18, donations data shows. It is the highest amount since 2010-11, when it donated $1,207,304, and more than 10 times the amount it gave in 2016-17, according to a Guardian Australia analysis. Spain\u2019s ruling socialists appear to have won the most votes but fallen short of a majority in a snap general election, but the far-right Vox party has carved into the vote for the traditional conservative party. A poll for the state-owned broadcaster, RTVE, published after voting finished gave Pedro S\u00e1nchez\u2019s Socialist Workers\u2019 party 116 to 121 seats. The late poll gave Vox as many as 38 seats but early results indicated it might be more like 24. Either way, it has been a terrible night for the mainstream conservative People\u2019s party.

World The rabbi wounded in the shooting at his synagogue in San Diego has issued a plea from hospital for \u201csenseless hate\u201d killings based on religion to stop. He said he was shot at point blank range and lost a finger as he held his hands up in defence, before a congregant, Lori Gilbert Kaye, hurled herself in front of him and was killed. The US attorney general, William Barr may, not attend a Thursday hearing to review the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report of the Trump-Russia investigation, after he expressed objections over the panel\u2019s questioning format. Five people have died and aid workers have reported scenes of destruction in the wake of Cyclone Kenneth, the second tropical cyclone to lay waste to parts of Mozambique in five weeks. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the comedian who last week won Ukraine\u2019s presidential election, has pledged to grant citizenship to Russians who \u201csuffer\u201d under the Kremlin\u2019s rule after dismissing an offer by Vladimir Putin to provide passports to Ukrainians. The organisers of a half-marathon in the Italian city of Trieste have backtracked on a decision to exclude African runners, which they claimed was meant to draw attention to their exploitation. Opinion and analysis Only two rental listings across Australia were affordable for the 500,000 single people on the Newstart allowance last month, a new report suggests. And of those homes considered affordable for those on the unemployment benefit, none were in an Australian capital city, according to Anglicare\u2019s 10th annual snapshot of the rental market. \u201cWhat this snapshot shows is that finding an affordable home in the private rental market is a complete fiction for people on low incomes,\u201d the report says. Resourcefulness and sacrifice is the only thing keeping a roof over the heads of many Australians.\u201d As Game of Thrones make the internet a landmine field of spoilers, Calla Wahlquist is actively seeking them out. She thinks she knows the next big twist in the HBO show but it is not ruining it for her. She writes: \u201cWhen you say a spoiler ruined a television show for you, what you really mean is you found out, a little ahead of time, that the story was rubbish anyway.\u201d No spoilers ahead! Sport Manchester City remain on course for the Premier League title after a 1-0 win at Burnley, thanks to a goal from Sergio Ag\u00fcero. The ball was shown to have crossed the line by only 29.51mm, but that was enough for City to retain their lead at the top over Liverpool, with two matches remaining. If A-league seasons are a marathon, not a sprint, the A-League premiership campaign that concluded on Sunday was one of those incorporating a fun run \u2013 where the stragglers cross the line in fancy dress hours after the medallists, writes Jonathan Howcroft. Thinking time: Bottled water sales show we don\u2019t really care For all the innovation and choice that define the food and drink industries, if you want to make money, you could do a lot worse than bunging some water in a bottle and flogging it. A litre of tap water, the stuff we have ingeniously piped into our homes, costs less than 200 times a litre of bottled water, especially for something fancy that has been sucked through a mountain. Yet the bottled water market is more buoyant than ever, defying the plastics backlash inspired by stricken albatrosses on the BBC\u2019s Blue Planet, and a broader, growing sense that something has to change. Sales in the UK increased 7% last year, or 8.5% by volume according to a different measure. Imagine laying out half-litre bottles on the pitch at Wembley Stadium. You could fit 1.7m bottles on the grass, packed into a tight grid. Now imagine building up layers of bottles, covering the same area, to build a tower. To contain all the bottled water we buy each year, you would end up with a 514m skyscraper. Environmental campaigners are struggling to fathom why nations blessed with clean tap water grow only fonder of the bottle. \u201cIt\u2019s very surprising to me,\u201d says Sam Chetan-Walsh, a political adviser at Greenpeace and campaigner against ocean plastic. \u201cPublic awareness has never been higher, but the message is not quite reaching all the people it needs to.\u201d Media roundup Game on: poll race tightens is the headline on the Australian\u2019s front page after the latest Newspoll. The Daily Telegraph says the chief sniper during Sydney\u2019s Lindt Cafe siege is suing NSW police for negligence, claiming he and other officers were not allowed to do their jobs the way they were trained. And the Sydney Morning Herald reveals that \u201ca former high-ranking police officer is being investigated for potentially accepting bribes\u201d as part of a security guard scam at the University of Sydney.
