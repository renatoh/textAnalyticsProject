But his newly politicized version of the poem (one terrible rhyme after another) brings out ghosts of election past \u2013 Hillary Clinton (Kate McKinnon) and Nate Silver (Mikey Day) \u2013 to doomsay his chances next week. He\u2019s joined by Lil Wayne (Chris Redd), Kamala Harris (Maya Rudolph) and a very unhealthy Mitch McConnell (Beck Bennett), suffering from a case of \u201cold man purple\u201d hands, before things sputter out. Given how self-assured Saturday Night Live was about Trump\u2019s chances four years ago, it really has no business scolding Biden supporters about taking victory for granted \u2013 which isn\u2019t even the case, as every liberal is stressing out the exact same way. The show could have delivered something clever and pessimistic regarding a potential second Trump victory. John Mulaney hosts for the fourth time. He launches into a new standup set, doing an impression of New York governor Andrew Cuomo by way of Tony Soprano, talking about the election \u2013 \u201cOn 3 November, there\u2019s an elderly man contest \u2026 we might have the same elderly man, or we might have a new elderly man\u201d \u2013 and giving a detailed and surprisingly raw description of a hypothetical girl\u2019s trouble with socializing. The best bit sees him voicing his frustration with his aged nana and the self-described Greatest Generation: \u201cOh, we fought the Nazis! Well, we\u2019re trying to fight the new Nazis if you\u2019d get out of the way and stop voting for people you saw in the coin commercial!\u201d On a Halloween edition of Cinema Classics, host Reese De\u2019What (Kenan Thompson\u2019s best and most underrated character) introduces a couple of alternate scenes from Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s horror classic The Birds. McKinnon\u2019s Tippi Hedren attempts to call Mulaney\u2019s local lawman for help, but he can\u2019t comprehend the situation: \u201cYou just said a bird set fire to a gas station, so you need to explain that to me\u201d. These sketches are always good for a laugh but this one is a little flat and contains far too much mugging from McKinnon. Strollin\u2019 is a 70s funk song about voting. Thompson, Redd, Ego Nwodim and Punkie Johnson are \u201cstrollin\u2019 to the polls\u201d, only to be turned away by a stodgy bureaucrat and intimidated by an armed white supremacist. It\u2019s hard to understand the point of a 70s musical number about modern day voter suppression, but it\u2019s a one-note joke regardless. Next, Mulaney plays Ichabod Crane, lost in the woods of Sleepy Hollow and confronted by the Headless Horseman. Although he\u2019s terrified, he can\u2019t help but ask the horseman if he ever uses his severed head \u201con \u2026 himself\u201d. They\u2019re joined by a couple of Puritans who ask the spirit even more graphic and specific questions, such as \u201cWhen your throat got cut, did it sever the gag reflex?\u201d It\u2019s puerile and funny and Mulaney\u2019s nonchalant shamelessness kicks it up a notch. The Strokes are the musical guest. They play The Adults Are Talking, off their new album, with a backdrop homage to the classic John Carpenter political satire-cum-horror film They Live. On Weekend Update, Colin Jost discusses Trump\u2019s Covid superspreader campaign events: \u201cDon\u2019t worry: the president isn\u2019t trying to kill his supporters \u2013 he\u2019s succeeding in killing his supporters \u2026 he\u2019s killed more people across the midwest than Jeffrey Dahmer and John Wayne Gacy combined.\u201d They welcome their sole guest, Baby Yoda (Kyle Mooney), to talk about the new season of The Mandalorian. He talks about fans DMing him (\u201cThey\u2019re sexual in nature\u201d), going on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast to promote his new line of cannabis products (\u201cHow you think I got so green?\u201d), and calls out his nemesis Baby Groot (\u201cIf you say my name one more time \u2013 I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d). It\u2019s pretty much a carbon copy of the character\u2019s previous appearance, and while the prosthetics continue to impress, the jokes fall flat. Next, Mulaney pulls off another big Broadway number, this time set in a Times Square souvenir shop, where Pete Davidson\u2019s ill-advised attempt to buy a pair of used novelty underpants leads to a musical tour of the back of the store. There we find a host of unhinged Times Square costumed characters as mascots, as well as shoplifters and random weirdos (such as the guy who recently assaulted Rick Moranis). They sing a medley of show tunes about the dirtier side of NYC, parodying classic songs from Chorus Line, Fiddler \u2013 or Diddler \u2013 on the Roof, Follies, Sweet Charity and Les Mis\u00e9rables. It\u2019s an enjoyable entry in this welcome new tradition, but it\u2019s noticeably smaller in scope and hilarity than the previous entries. The Strokes return for a performance of Bad Decisions. Then the final sketch sees a return of Mulaney and Davidson\u2019s uncle-nephew pair from his last time hosting. Mulaney is once again furious about his nephew using a dopey dating profile picture of him and turning it into a meme, accompanied by such text as \u201cHello Darling, you may whack me in the penis with a golf club\u201d, \u201cWhen she come over and say \u2018Hi, my name is Chris Hansen\u2019\u201d, and \u201cThat feeling when the priest put the fingers in your mouth during communion!\u201d As with the other recurring sketches, it\u2019s a disappointing case of diminishing returns. The same may be said of the episode as a whole, the least of Mulaney\u2019s four. On its own, this wouldn\u2019t be anything too disappointing \u2013 every at-bat can\u2019t be a home run, after all \u2013 but given that it fell on both Halloween and the Saturday before election day, you\u2019d expect things to feel a little bigger and livelier. This proved little more memorable than any of the four episodes that have preceded it this season. This doesn\u2019t bode well for next week\u2019s post-election episode, although in terms of potential disasters awaiting us a week from now, that\u2019s very low on the list. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 November 2020. An earlier version incorrectly said Mulaney described his daughter\u2019s trouble with socializing. He was describing a hypothetical scenario."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
