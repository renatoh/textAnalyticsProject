A source close to the investigation said he felt there was sufficient evidence to merit further inquiry. The investigation was sparked by an incident in this year's Tour involving the Texan and Filippo Simeoni. The Italian rider was a prosecution witness against Armstrong's trainer Michele Ferrari, who was given a one-year suspended prison sentence on October 1 for sporting fraud, a charge which covers helping riders to dope and thus win races fraudulently. None of the charges against Ferrari related to Armstrong, but the Texan was steadfast in his support for the trainer until he was found guilty, and two days before the Tour finish he rode across to an escape including Simeoni during the stage to Lons le Saunier in central France and, according to Simeoni, made it clear that the group would not be allowed to remain in front unless the Italian dropped back. A source close to the investigation said yesterday: \"We have heard from Simeoni and the other riders involved in this well-known stage of the Tour and are waiting for the prosecutor's decision before proceeding to the next stage of the inquiry. It's too soon to talk of a trial.\" The source denied speculation that charges against Armstrong might include sporting fraud, which relates to his denying Simeoni a fair chance to contest the stage win, as Simeoni has claimed. Armstrong yesterday said that he felt the Italian authorities had no grounds for pressing charges of any kind. \"To try and make the case that I tried to intimidate a witness, that I'm potentially guilty of sporting fraud because I was just contesting my sport - it's ludicrous. As we know, the climate in Italy is very political right now and very motivated to keep the issue of doping in the forefront and this is just another subplot.\" For the first time, the Texan admitted yesterday that he might have made the wrong decision in denying Simeoni his chance to win the stage. \"We can all say: 'Lance, you should have done that or you shouldn't have done this; you're the yellow jersey and don't waste your time doing that' - that's all fine. I'm fine with an editorial that says 'bad move, no class'. No problem. But to then be investigated for intimidating a witness, sporting fraud and whatever the other charge is, that's crazy.\" Speaking to the website cyclingnews.com Armstrong added that he was unlikely to contest the Giro d'Italia next year for the first time because he was afraid the police might take him and his team, sponsored by the Discovery Channel, in for questioning. \"I have to ask myself, do I want to subject myself and my team and my sponsor to a tremendous photo op for the Italian police, and the answer to that is no. Why would I want to show up and have them waiting at the airport and whisk me off? They are wasting their time for something that has no effect on their process over there and on what's fair and right over there.\" Management at the Texan's team said the decision whether he will go for a seventh win on the Tour de France will not be taken until he begins racing in February. Whether or not Armstrong is present, next year's Tour seems likely to be without Mario Cipollini, the best sprinter of the 1990s. The flamboyant Italian is expected to announce his retirement today. The course for 2005 will hold no fears for the Texan. The race does not return to L'Alpe d'Huez but takes in climbs in the Vosges and Pyrenees."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
