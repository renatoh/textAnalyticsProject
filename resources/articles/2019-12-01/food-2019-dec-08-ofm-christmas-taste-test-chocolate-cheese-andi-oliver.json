Quite nutty with good creaminess. Immediately made me want to reach for the port. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Waitrose Extra Mature Cornish Quartz Cheese, 300g, \u00a34, waitrose.com Nice appearance. Almost a bit of a parmesan-y crystal crunch through it, which I\u2019m a bit of a sucker for. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Tesco Finest Extra Mature English Cheddar, 350g, \u00a33, tesco.com Nutty with a creamy finish. There\u2019s a slightly funny aftertaste, leaves a sort of residue on the palate. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Sainsbury\u2019s Taste the Difference Cave Aged Cheddar Truckle, 400g, \u00a34, sainsburys.com It\u2019s strong. Really nice kick. This took a while to develop but does have good power. Looks a bit too yellow to me. \u2605\u2605 Potted stiltons Paxton &amp; Whitfield Stilton Jar, 250g, \u00a319.50 paxtonandwhitfield.co.uk This one has a butter cap. Smacks you right between the eyes. Oooh! Wow, it\u2019s really strong, which is excellent. I love a good strong stilton. It\u2019s got great acidity. Texturally it\u2019s a little bit smooth for me but it really packs a punch. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Tesco Stilton Jar, 225g, \u00a34, tesco.com Quite a pale looking stilton\u2026 Wow, that is really potent. Lovely creamy finish. The acidity is really good. It starts off strong and then there\u2019s quite an enjoyable mellowness that comes afterwards. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Marks &amp; Spencer Award Winning Blue Stilton, 300g, \u00a35, marksandspencer.com Nice acidic, stilton punch to it, exactly what you\u2019re looking for. Texturally it\u2019s really nice, with a good clean aftertaste. Sharpness and good creaminess\u2026 I like that a lot. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Waitrose Cropwell Bishop Potted Blue Stilton, 300g, \u00a311, waitrose.com This has a crumblier texture \u2013 fabulous. A little less powerful in flavour. It\u2019s creamy and delicious again. Once you started eating it, you\u2019ll be still sitting there 20 minutes later. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Baked cheeses Morrisons The Best Baking Brie with Cranberries and Sloe Gin Drizzle, 590g, \u00a36, morrisons.com I love the serving dish. The cheese is pungent \u2013 absolutely delicious. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Sainsbury\u2019s Taste the Difference Baking Camembert with Sloe Gin and Fruit, 290g, \u00a33.50, sainsburys.co.uk A gooey situation with warmth from the gin. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Aldi Specially Selected Normandy Baking Camembert, 290g, \u00a32.79, aldi.co.uk A bit pappy texturally - a sweet jam on top of liquid cheese. The cheese isn\u2019t strong enough. A bit sickly. \u2605\u2605 Marks &amp; Spencer Brie En-Croute, 729g, \u00a312, marksandspencer.com Looks fabulous but it is very salty and overwhelming. Slight egginess actually. There are big cloves of garlic. \u2605 Salted caramels Hotel Chocolat Milk Salted Caramel Selector, 55g, \u00a33.95, hotelchocolat.com I like the size of this one. That caramel tastes a bit different. This chocolate tastes grown-up. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Chococo Box of Cornish Sea Salt Caramel Chocolates, 100g, \u00a311.50, chococo.co.uk Nostalgic looking. Very runny caramel. It\u2019s got a weird sourness to the caramel\u2026 A bit sickly. \u2605\u2605 Sainsbury\u2019s Taste the Difference Belgian Salted Caramels, 140g, \u00a35, sainsburys.com They look a little cheap. Overly sweet; minimal salt. A bit big. I\u2019m not sure the chocolate is that great. \u2605\u2605 Lily O\u2019Brien\u2019s Salted Caramels Tree Box, 108g, \u00a34.50, lilyobriens.co.uk I like the way this looks. More of a fudgey caramel, with a slightly chalky-fudgey texture. I can\u2019t taste any salt. Incredibly sweet. \u2605\u2605 Chocolate boxes under \u00a310 Co-op Irresistible Luxury Collection, 16 chocolates, \u00a36, coop.co.uk Nice looking little box of chocs. Tasty chocolate and the fillings are quite good too. The best box. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Moser Roth Artisan Collection, 225g, \u00a37.99, aldi.co.uk Quite kiddy looking. Taste a lot better than they look. Much more chocolatey than I expected and not too sweet. Quite surprising. \u2605\u2605 Cocoa et Co Festive Collection, 155g, \u00a36, sainsburys.co.uk These could go on a Christmas tree. Underwhelming, but not too sweet and you can taste the chocolate. Just not very exciting. \u2605\u2605 Lily O\u2019Brien Winter Desserts Collection, 224g, \u00a37, lilyobriens.co.uk Big chocolates. Crikey \u2026 just sugar. The chocolate does not have much punch. Looks good, but underwhelming flavour, overwhelming sweetness. \u2605 Chocolate boxes under \u00a320 Selfridges Festive Chocolate Collection, 210g, \u00a314.99, selfridges.com These look handmade, artisan. The chocolate tastes nice, quite creamy, no waxy aftertaste. A nice present. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Marks &amp; Spencer Signature Collection, 390g, \u00a315, marksandspencer.com Oddly perfumed. The chocolate is better than I thought it would be. Surprising. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Chococo Christmas Selection Box, 200g, \u00a317.50, chococo.co.uk The chocolate tastes OK, mid-range. Not sickly. A funny aftertaste. Not exciting but they\u2019ve made an effort. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Hotel Chocolat The Classic Christmas Chocolate H-box, 160g, \u00a312.95, hotelchocolat.com Look like they\u2019re straight out of a Christmas stocking. Don\u2019t pack much of a punch, and not a lot of variety. \u2605\u2605"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
