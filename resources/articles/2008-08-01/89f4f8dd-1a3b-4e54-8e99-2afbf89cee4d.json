The best ones give you an insight into the nuts and bolts of film-making, a glimpse into what it takes to make a movie. But nowadays they are turning into vacuous promotional exercises. The bigger the picture, the more \"amazing\" the actors/ director/ atmosphere on set. Not much to learn there. Thankfully there are new ways of heading behind-the-scenes, one of which has been pioneered by Pedro Almod\u00f3var. The great Spaniard is currently shooting his next movie, Los Abrazos Rotos (Broken Embraces) in Madrid, and for the past months, he has been blogging about the preparations. It's a treat to read. One of my favourite posts deals with finding the right hairdos for Pen\u00e9lope Cruz's character. As Almod\u00f3var explains, she \"lives two very different, almost opposing, lives, that naturally must be characterized, among other things, by very different hairstyles\". One aspect of her character sees her \"pursued by fatality, a fighter with no luck, a fallen angel,\" the other as \"light, pop, na\u00efve, outrageous, exultant.\" To represent this duality, Almod\u00f3var and Cruz try out different styles, from the wavy platinum bob to the Audrey Hepburn-style bun. Looking at the posted pictures, it's amazing to see the difference just swapping wigs can make. The director invites us into his office, where actors are rehearsing scenes - you see his desk, a wall of books behind. There he explains his faith in his actors, miles away from the Alfred Hitchcock approach. If you want to make a good movie, you must trust and nurture your cast, he says. \"[They are] what give me the greatest feeling of security when it comes to breathing life into this story.\" Elsewhere the director explains how he sometimes talks to actors as he would talk to their characters, or makes them relate to one another in character. It's \"something very Pirandello-like; the actors get inside their characters and talk among themselves with the only information to which they have access, that is, what I give them in the script. As well as being fun, it's a very good exercise for feeling that you are 'the other'.\" And it's good rehearsal practice before shooting. In his latest post, Almod\u00f3var reveals his influences for Broken Embraces, ranging from film noir to melodrama. \"We've finished the ninth week of shooting. These days we are tackling the darkest part of the film. The film touches on many genres. This week, it's the thriller. I admit that in recent years I've had a weakness for this genre. (And for the western, but I wouldn't know how to come to grips with a western).\" Almod\u00f3var reveals just enough information to keep you interested while cannily not revealing the whole plot. So to describe what Broken Embraces is about, Almod\u00f3var recalls Louis Malle's Lift to the Scaffold. \"At the end, when the characters of [Jeanne] Moreau and her unfortunate lover Maurice Ronet are cornered, condemned to live in different prisons, some photos appear of the couple in their good moments, embracing. \"Jeanne Moreau's voiceover talks of those photographed embraces as something eternal, something that no one will be able to break and that will remain forever, while she will waste away in prison. My next film, Broken Embraces, talks about that kind of embrace.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
