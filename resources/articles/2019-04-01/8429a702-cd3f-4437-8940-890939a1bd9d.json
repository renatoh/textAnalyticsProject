A tie that might have veered away from them, particularly while they laboured to contain Slavia Prague\u2019s urgent intent, was claimed late on by a marauding full-back, breaking late into the box to meet an inviting centre. That, at the very least, was an indication of this team\u2019s underlying ambition. Marcos Alonso has not been himself since the onset of winter so it was reassuring to see him galloping untracked between defenders again, even in the dregs of the game, to meet Willian\u2019s cross before planting an emphatic winning goal beyond Ondrej Kolar. Chelsea will boast another dimension to their attacking play if they can coax a consistent threat from their left-back, so integral had he been to their encouraging progress under Maurizio Sarri\u2019s stewardship at the start of the campaign. The finish served to inflict Slavia\u2019s first home defeat since August and probably one their tenacious display had not warranted given the extent to which they had unnerved the visitors. Yet, in adversity, Sarri spied promise for the decisive run-in ahead. \u201cIn the past, when we have been in trouble, we\u2019d concede immediately a goal,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we are able to stay in trouble, to fight, to suffer without conceding anything. And so that\u2019s a step forward for us. \u201cThis was a very difficult game, so I\u2019m really happy with the result and also with the performance because, in this moment, we are able to suffer.\u201d They may need to weather a wilder storm at Anfield on Sunday. It had taken Kepa Arrizabalaga, blocking from Ibrahim Benjamin Traor\u00e9 and Jan Boril, to preserve the clean sheet while Chelsea, unsettled by their hosts\u2019 energy, personified by Peter Olayinka\u2019s constant running, laboured to retain possession or make in-roads of their own. This quarter-final represented the sternest test of a kind Europa League campaign and for all that Willian had whipped a fine shot on to the crossbar midway through the opening period Chelsea had mustered little threat of their own until Alonso\u2019s unexpected intervention. Sarri would fling on Eden Hazard, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and Ruben Loftus-Cheek from the bench in a bid to impose some control, but the goal was wholly against the run of play. Slavia probably deserved better, for all that their efforts did not yield enough clear-cut opportunities. A team who had managed four goals while emerging out of the group before Christmas \u2013 they had since scored four at Genk and at home to Sevilla in the knockout phase \u2013 reverted to type, with excellent approach play running aground on Chelsea\u2019s stubborn defence. Antonio R\u00fcdiger, bellowing instruction at team-mates in a bid to raise standards, repelled everything flung at him. C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, dragged out of position at times, was as obstinate and unflappable as ever. \u201cThey were aggressive, but we were able to face them well,\u201d said Sarri. \u201cThe second leg will be just as difficult because these opponents are just as dangerous away from home, as they showed in Genk.\u201d This tie has not yet been properly claimed, but the advantage is undoubtedly with Chelsea."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
