But that's just part of it. There has been a significant decline in satisfaction with broadband in the UK in the past 10 months, according to the latest consumer survey of more than 5,000 people, undertaken by YouGov and Ipsos MORI for Point Topic (point-topic.com). \"From 92% of respondents saying they were 'very' or 'fairly' satisfied in February 2006 with the service they receive overall, it has dropped to 77% in December 2006,\" says Point Topic. \"Of particular note was the change in users who reported being 'very' or 'fairly' dissatisfied with the 'after sales support' which went from 7% in Feb 2006 to 18.3% in Dec 2006.\" You won't be surprised to find there is a pattern to the dissatisfaction. According to Tim Johnson, chief consultant at Point Topic, it's \"the whole movement to free and bundled broadband, which was accompanied by a big move to LLU or 'local loop unbundling'. The evidence is that LLU customers are less satisfied by every measure than non-LLU customers, even if they don't know they've got it.\" LLU involves other companies taking over the line from the telephone exchange to the home. The idea was brought in by Ofcom, the telecoms regulator, to reduce prices and increase competition. It's the initiative jumped on by Talk Talk, among others. \"It's not as simple as LLU bad, old-style good,\" says Johnson, \"but Talk Talk customers have quite a high level of dissatisfaction.\" In fact, the move to LLU appears to have depressed the whole market slightly. \"People who haven't done anything are also unhappier,\" says Johnson. \"They may be thinking, 'perhaps I'm paying more than I should be'.\" On the other hand, Johnson feels that this has also shifted consumer feeling against buying purely on price - especially in the London suburbs where LLU take-up is greatest and where many people can afford to pay a bit more. \"There's an awareness that price is not the only factor [in broadband]. It's not worth the money if it doesn't work.\" It will be interesting to see whether the next survey shows further decline or a recovery. Johnson seems optimistic that things will improve as new suppliers are \"bedded in\", catch up with the backlog created by price-cuts and expand LLU use even further. He's also optimistic about Ofcom's new MAC (Migration Authorisation Codes) process, introduced on February 14. This stops suppliers from holding on even when they believe they are owed money (\"debt blocking,\" it's called), and should make it much simpler for consumers to change their broadband provider. \"I hope that means people will have less to complain about,\" says Johnson. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
