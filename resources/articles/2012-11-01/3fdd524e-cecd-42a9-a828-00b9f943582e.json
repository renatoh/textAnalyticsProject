Magazines in Germany and France started to publish, rather than one frame, whole sets of pictures to illustrate stories more effectively. A few years later, Roy Stryker, of the Farm Security Administration, was commissioning photographers to capture the effects of drought and depression on American farming communities. Life magazine was relaunched by Henry Luce in 1936. The Magnum Photos agency, a response to these new markets, was founded by Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa and others in 1947. There is no clear indication as to when the term was first used or by whom. Wilson Hicks in his 1952 book, Words and Pictures, is one possibility, or maybe it was Luce himself. Photojournalism is perhaps best described as the illustration of an aspect of contemporary life by a series of pictures, usually in combination with a written story. Often it reflects a strong social concern, sometimes it is highly polemical. Examples include the work of William Eugene Smith covering the effects of mercury poisoning in Minamata (main image) or that of Philip Jones Griffiths in Vietnam (see above and below). The \"in-depth\" nature of photojournalism distinguishes it from the equally important work of press photographers, and its very contemporary nature from the work of documentary photographers. They all overlap and they all, like written journalism, bring the influence of a wider world into our lives. An instinctive genre Photojournalism is not a craft that can be taught comprehensively. So much of this kind of photography relies on instinct and reaction: an awareness of the value of each image to the whole story, of sensitivity to the subject matter, of composition, of the documenting of events over time as well as, inevitably, the restrictions, whether real or imagined, involved in working for the publications for which the story might be aimed. Most of this, if not in some way already part of the photographer's character, is gained through experience, often hard won, rather than through any form of specific education. However, there are valuable ideas and lessons that might be passed on. At its most basic and generalised, an education in photojournalism should teach you how to see. And, after understanding that, how to organise a response to what you have seen. Let's, for fun, make an extended metaphor. To feed your family you are hunting deer. To do this you need to understand the habits of the beasts, the way they move, the paths they take. But also the change in their appearance as they move through the dappled light of a woodland or stand in the shadow of a cliff. You need to watch the sky to predict how the light might change. You need to understand from a distance whether the buck has his head raised or is grazing, you need complete knowledge of their environment, of the changing nature of light, of the habits of your intended lunch. This is the ability to see. The photojournalist needs this before anything else. Now you might well complain that this is far too preposterous an example. After all, hanging round Downing Street or dodging shell fire in Aleppo is hardly the same as hunting deer in a sun-dappled woodland. But I think the general point would be that, before anything else, you have to sharpen your level of perception so you see more than you did before in your everyday life. You must start to miss nothing. Be at ease with your kit Anticipate the light, be aware of your own presence and react quickly when the time is right. Cultivate a natural, easy relationship with your equipment. Nothing you use should get in the way of your response to the story. In the days of plate cameras, press photographers would set their speed graphics to 1/250th of a second at an aperture of f/8 (a lens distance of about 2m): an all\u2011encompassing combination designed to catch any picture in a hurry. The equipment now is very different, but the camera should still effectively be an extension of your hands and eyes. The less obvious it is and the more naturally that you use it \u2013 such as in the photos of Gordon Brown (above) \u2013 the less likely you are to impose your presence on the subject. Sometimes pictures, through the apparent reaction of the subjects to the camera, seem incomplete without an image of the photographer and are weakened as a result. Choose equipment that you find easy to use and get used to using a limited range of small, portable lenses. Try keeping it in a handbag or a shopping bag. Throw away the lens cap. Have it set for use all the time. Treasure it. Find something new to say Pick a story that has a special meaning for you and try to make sure that it has not already been well covered by others. During the Libyan civil war, 400 unaccredited freelance photographers turned up in the conflict zone. Very, very few had anything new to contribute to the story. Perhaps a bit pretentiously, a photojournalist's role is \"to expand our awareness of the world we inhabit\" and to suggest new ways of regarding it. This can be in the north African desert or, of course, in the suburbs of London. There is little point in pursuing a story unless your pictures give it a new angle. Think hard about how the reader will interpret it on publication. Digital photography and the internet have radically altered both the practice and the market for photojournalism. To some this has meant a retreat into the exclusivity of gallery walls and coffee-table books. For others the reaction has been to build up mass imagery, such as online photostreams. But the ability of still images to put across indirect, complex and new ideas remains a potent communication tool, and their vivid authority through the eyes of the individual photographer has the potential to change minds and sometimes, even, to change our world for the better. Readers' assignment Think of a local service or institution: an independent manufacturer, craftsperson or farmer. Try to persuade them to allow themselves and their workforce to be photographed in a series of pictures that seeks to explain both the process and the working lives of those involved. Look out for the interactions between individuals.
