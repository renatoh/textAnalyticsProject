In reality, the idea is nonsensical. A summer fragrance is whatever you choose to wear, so don\u2019t feel obliged to play by the rules. Diptyque\u2019s Eau de Minth\u00e9 is slightly off the beaten track: yes there\u2019s a floral (rose) accord, but the predominant notes are mint and nutmeg. Jo Malone x Huntsman Birch and Black Pepper is touted as a men\u2019s fragrance, but I\u2019d happily wear its smoky sexiness all year long. If you gravitate towards a sophisticated floral, there is plenty on offer. Cloon Keen\u2019s L\u00e1 Bealtaine \u2013 a blend of jasmine, tuberose, mandarin, bergamot and neroli \u2013 is unapologetically ultra-feminine. Burberry\u2019s Her Blossom and Gucci Bloom also fit well into the archetypal floral family. Prada\u2019s Water Splash does, too, but it infuses the green notes of the frangipani flower with a touch of mandarin. Byredo also taps into the mandarin, but blends it with jasmine and cotton candy. Orange Sanguine by Atelier Cologne captures freshly cut oranges in a bottle and is totally gender neutral, as is Clean\u2019s Solar Bloom \u2013 a floral with the base note of patchouli. And for a bit of nostalgia there\u2019s always the special summer edition of CK One \u2013 a throwback to the days when \u201csummer fragrances\u201d were all the rage.

Choices that work perfectly well in autumnal climes, like a decent foundation and a smoky eye, suddenly seem OTT and no longer feel like they have any business on your face. Additionally, not all makeup is comfortable on the skin in the heat and many products wither under the pressure. And so the potential for looking totally out of step is real. However, the prevailing mindset that we should forego makeup in summer (because it\u2019s all about being \u201cnatural\u201d) doesn\u2019t work for everyone \u2013 many, like me, want maquillage all year round and there is no sin in that. Wearing it well is all about clever application and key products. Bronzers and highlighters are the quickest ways to deliver colour, glow and life to the skin. I\u2019ve found scraping a tiny bit of powder highlighter and blending it into your serum is a brilliant application technique. Blushers always add youthfulness, a pop of colour on the lips distracts from lacklustre skin, waterproof mascara is obligatory and if you do still want a cover-up without the weight, mix foundation with hyaluronic acid and apply. Because sometimes, a tinted moisturiser just won\u2019t do.

Drunk Elephant\u2019s D-Bronzi is chock full of antioxidants that mimic the benefits you get from vitamin D. It can be added into your moisturiser to give your skin a bit of colour without the weight of a foundation. Amanda Harrington\u2019s face and body tanning range is incredible. Infused with tons of skin-loving ingredients, it comes in a range of skin tones and leaves you with a natural-looking glow. Top it off with Anastasia\u2019s Shimmer Body Oil and you\u2019ll give JLo a run for her money. But here\u2019s the thing: you still need sunscreen because those pesky rays get everywhere. So, the basics: SPF is a measure of how well your sunscreen protects you from sunburn. SPF 15 blocks 93% of UVB rays, SPF 30 blocks 97% and SPF 50 blocks 98%. Ideally you should use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with both UVB (protects against the burn) and UVA (protects against premature ageing). For sunscreen to be truly effective you should be applying it at least 20 minutes before leaving the house, reapplying every two hours and, no, you can\u2019t use the same old one you\u2019ve been wheeling out for the past five years. Chances are it\u2019s way past its expiry date and doing absolutely nothing for you.
