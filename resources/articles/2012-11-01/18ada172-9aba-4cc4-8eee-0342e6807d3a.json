The seasonal bulbous fruit has long lived in the shadow of the pumpkin, a rival relentlessly promoted by our cousins across the pond. Some serious elbow grease is required to peel and cut it, but the rewards \u2013 a ripe, sweet-tasting, deep orange pulp \u2013 are worth the cussing and its shape makes for a wonderful edible bowl. True, the butternut might not be the most flavourful of ingredients; but its velvety texture speaks of comfort and heartiness. It makes a wonderful pairing with chorizo and pulled pork. And with spices, it comes to life. Stick it in the oven for half an hour, coated in olive oil with cumin seeds and cinnamon. It sounds minimal, but, honestly, magic will ensue. When warmth is needed, serve it as a thick, buttery soup, topped with a dollop of Greek yoghurt and roasted pine nuts. If you don't have a fireplace, this is the next best thing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
