Long before he became a star of the World Cup-winning France team last year, his talent and renown grew at the Stade L\u00e9o Lagrange in the banlieue \u2013 suburb \u2013 of Bondy, which now, thanks to him, has a permanent place in French football history. Today, on an overcast June afternoon, the pitch at L\u00e9o Lagrange is filled with the shouts of girls, 130 of them, many with the name of Bondy\u2019s favourite son emblazoned across their backs. They are competing in a tournament \u2013 an all-out battle of the banlieues \u2013 to mark the start of the Women\u2019s World Cup. It may be a casual contest but the competition is fierce, the pace blistering and the talent plain to see. In the first match the girls from Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s first club, AS Bondy, face off against a team from the nearby Clichy-sous-Bois. It goes to a penalty shootout. Bondy\u2019s captain steps up confidently to take her shot but the ball goes straight into the keeper\u2019s hands. When her counterpart then slots it past Bondy\u2019s keeper, a group of girls on the sidelines in Clichy tracksuits let loose yells of joy. \u201cClichy, Clichy, Clichy,\u201d they chant, streaming across the pitch to embrace their players, just as two nights earlier the France captain, Amandine Henry, had sprinted across the Parc des Princes to celebrate with the bench having put the home side 4-0 up against South Korea in the World Cup\u2019s opening match. This is the type of football Bondy has become famous for, the type that has led the Paris banlieues to be dubbed \u201cthe laboratory of football\u201d because of the talent they produce. But if the path to international superstar is not easy, and if only a select few such as Mbapp\u00e9 and Paul Pogba get to play for the biggest clubs in the world, opportunities are even scarcer for girls. Mohamed Wague, a youth worker at Bondy and the tournament\u2019s organiser, says the suburb produces five or six professional footballers from its boys\u2019 ranks each year. But Bondy added a girls\u2019 side to their ranks only four years ago due to strong demand in the neighbourhood. Until then young footballers such as Shenice Laclef had to go to nearby suburbs such as Pavillons-sous-Bois to play. Laclef, 18 and a defender, wanted to turn professional like Mbapp\u00e9 \u2013 she even trained with him once at Bondy \u2013 but she says she never quite made it. \u201cI had the hope to succeed at women\u2019s football, and I did lots of try-outs,\u201d she says. \u201cI persisted, persisted, persisted, but I never had a callback.\u201d Part of the problem is getting seen \u2013 the banlieues are awash with scouts hunting for the next big male talent but Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Suner, the sports director at Bondy who famously trained Mbapp\u00e9, says they very rarely see scouts on the lookout for girls. Even Lyon, described as the most dominant professional team in any sport, played by any gender, anywhere on the planet \u2013 rely largely on their boys\u2019 recruitment team to flag significant talent to the women\u2019s department, says Sonia Bompastor, the director of their women\u2019s academy. Bompastor, who captained France from 2004-06, says the club has only one scout dedicated to unearthing female talent. If a girl does get scouted by a professional club such as Lyon \u2013 who, Bompastor says, dedicate the same resources to girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 development \u2013 the path will be different to her male counterparts\u2019. Girls at Lyon are required to stay at school until the age of 18 whereas boys are allowed to drop out at 16, she says. Because girls need a back-up plan. \u201cThe economy for women\u2019s football is different from men\u2019s,\u201d she adds. \u201cWhen we finish our football career, we suddenly have to think about getting a job.\u201d Inequality in French football goes well beyond salaries \u2013 in the days before their World Cup opener the France women\u2019s team were ushered out of the national training facility at Clairefontaine to make way for the men, who were preparing for a low-stakes friendly against Bolivia. It\u2019s a problem familiar to the girls at Bondy. \u201cEven here we don\u2019t have the same rights,\u201d says Oc\u00e9ane Jourdain, a 16-year-old forward with the club. \u201cThe girls train on the grass while the boys train on the synthetic pitch \u2026 There are lots of things that are different.\u201d Suner says next year the club will get a second artificial pitch, which will allow them to cater better to the girls\u2019 team. Still, things are changing in French football, and it is as apparent at Bondy as it is in the top-notch facilities at Lyon. Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s name may be everywhere but there were others on the lips of the players at Sunday\u2019s tournament. \u201cWendie Renard, I love you,\u201d declares 17-year-old Bintou Dabo, citing France\u2019s best player from the opening match, the defender who scored two goals against South Korea. Even in her short life, Dabo says she has seen things change for female footballers. \u201cWomen\u2019s football has really started to become integrated into society,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a great pleasure to see, because it\u2019s really growing in comparison to previous years.\u201d Wague says the girls\u2019 sides in the banlieues are gaining in strength and numbers year by year, and he has seen an appreciable boost in sign-ups in the lead-up to the World Cup. \u201cI can\u2019t say it\u2019s similar to Mbapp\u00e9 \u2013 everyone has their own path and their own story \u2013 but we have very talented girls at Bondy,\u201d he says. Almost single-handedly, and at the age of 19, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 launched this banlieue into football\u2019s firmament. Now there are hundreds of girls in Bondy who want to do the same in the women\u2019s game. If one makes it, she will have big boots to fill. \u201cMaybe one day a girl from Bondy will join the French team, and we\u2019ll be happy,\u201d Laclef says. \u201cBut Mbapp\u00e9 is Mbapp\u00e9.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
