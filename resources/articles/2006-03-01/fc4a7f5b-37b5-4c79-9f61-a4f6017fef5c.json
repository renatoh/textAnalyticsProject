One of France's pre-eminent poets, winner of the Grand Prix and the Prix Goncourt, his work is nevertheless largely unknown on this side of the Channel. This selection is drawn from his first - and possibly finest - three collections, and beautifully translated by the poet Jennie Feldman with help from Reda himself. Reda originally made his name as a jazz critic, and the rhythms of jazz swoop and dive through his poems. His subjects are a fl\u00e2neur's subjects: \"the lime tree in the narrow yard of the Jewish butcher\"; \"Laundry majestic above the radishes\"; streets, houses, people's faces. Within his world, however, familiar objects are loaded with significance. His skies, in particular, reflect meaning; he pictures them frequently at dawn or twilight, preferring the softer ambiguities of \"the day's equable rose already spiking through brambles\" or \"the rays of evening ... / Where sky leans over uncertain, waiting for a shadow\" to midday's \"haggard gaze\". These are glorious poems, lucent and exquisite, and no poetry-lover's bookshelf will be complete without them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
