That assessment, based on the chancellor's 18 volume Treasury assessment, is expected to be \"yes, but not yet\". It will be made public in a statement to parliament on Monday afternoon. Speaking at the end of an unprecedented three-hour meeting, Mr Brown said: \"We are all resolved that the decision on the euro must be taken in the national economic interest and it will be the national economic interest that will be the determining factor.\". The prime minister and Mr Brown are expected to hold a joint press conference, either on Monday or Tuesday, to stress the unanimity of their joint position on the single currency. Speaking briefly to reporters at the end of the marathon session, the chancellor said: \"We are all resolved that nothing must be done that will put the stability of the British economy at risk. Indeed we want to entrench that stability for the long term for Britain.\" He left without taking questions. Today's meeting of the full cabinet, which ordinarily meets for around 45 minutes on a Thursday morning, follows one-to-one chats between the prime minister, chancellor and each invdividual cabinet minister. According to months of speculation, a fierce argument has raged between the prime minister and Mr Brown on whether a \"no\" assessment rules out further consideration of the euro for the rest of this parliament. Cabinet members have been ploughing through the Treasury's assessment of the five tests, along with 18 supporting academic studies, on the impact that entering the single currency would have on the UK economy. Those volumes will be released to parliament, and to the public, at 9am on Monday, allowing MPs just over six hours to familiarise themselves with the argument. It emerged today that the prime minister himself may have not read the mountains of documents word for word. Asked today whether Mr Blair had read all the documents, his official spokesman said: \"The prime minister has obviously devoted a considerable amount of time to this issue as you would expect, given that it is one of the most important issues any government could face,\" he said. The spokesman was pressed on whether Mr Blair had read it \"cover-to-cover\". \"You can certainly take it that the prime minister has devoted a huge amount of his own personal time and energy to what is a very important decision for any government,\" he said. \"The fact that we have had such a detailed process and open process with the cabinet shows, I think, the level of that commitment.\" There is speculation that the assessment shows that only one of the five tests, on the impact of the euro on the UK's financial services industry, has been met. The remaining four - whether there is sustainable convergence between Britain and the eurozone; whether there is sufficient flexibility to cope with economic change; what the impact on investment would be; and the effect on stability, growth and jobs - have not been met, reports suggest. A group of senior union leaders were today urging the prime minister to hold a referendum on the euro by next spring and warned that a continuing delay was threatening jobs. In a letter to Tony Blair, the union officials said adopting the single currency would help deliver a strong economy. The unions argue that to rule it out for the life of this parliament would be a victory for the \"anti-European scaremongers\" and would sacrifice British influence in Brussels. The letter was signed by former TUC general secretary John Monks; the new general secretary of the GMB, Kevin Curran; Tony Dubbins, general secretary of the Graphical Paper and Media Union; Ed Sweeney, general secretary of the finance union Unify; and Mike Leahy, general secretary of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation. Earlier this week, in a last gasp bid to influence the debate, the pro-euro Foreign Policy Centre issued a 10-point \"roadmap\", outlining how the UK could now win a referendum. The official procedure, laid out by the government, would see a positive assessment by the chancellor, then ratified by the cabinet, put to the people in the form of a referendum, the wording of which would be set by the government but scrutinised by the independent electoral commission. Its plan includes publishing the terms of the referendum now, and setting up a euro strategy group, comprised of the prime minister, the deputy prime minister, the chancellor, the foreign secretary, the trade and industry secretary, and the work and pensions secretary. Geoffrey Howe, a former chancellor and foreign secretary and a member of the panel, said: \"We've spent enough time trying to read the crystal ball. The most important thing is a clear affirmation that it is unambiguously in Britain's interest to join the single currency. \"The prime minister and his cabinet must now set about making the positive case. It's high time for the government to set out a road map as clear as this.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
