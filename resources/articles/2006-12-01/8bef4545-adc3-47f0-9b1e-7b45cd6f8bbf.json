Nutritionists, however, say that the amount of Omega 3 in these foods is usually minute, compared with the quantities you can get by eating oily fish. The trouble is, environmentalists, along with vegetarians are more than a little concerned by reports suggesting that at least 75% of the world's fish stocks are either exploited or significantly depleted. So where do we go for an Omega 3 fix? Those that go to health food shops or visit the specialist food section at their supermarket, will have noticed the invasion of hemp-based foods in recent months. Hemp oil, hemp seeds, hemp bars, hemp sauce and even hemp bread are among the foodstuffs now available. It is perfect timing really, as according to nutritionists, the hemp seed contains the perfectly balanced 3:1 ratio of both the essential fatty acids Omega 3 and 6. On top of that hemp grows plentifully on almost any type of ground and doesn't really require any pesticides. Convinced that hemp could be \"the future\", and assured that I couldn't get high or overdose on it, I decided to see how many different ways I could fit this new green superfood into my diet during a normal working week. It wasn't as difficult as it might sound. Monday Breakfast: Organic apple &amp; cranberry hemp bar from Mother Hemp. Lunch: Veggie burger and salad with plenty of hemp oil from Yaoh and balsamic vinegar. Dinner: Hemp spaghetti from Yorkshire Hemp and sundried tomato pesto from Mother Hemp. I drizzle some hemp oil on too - as long as you don't actually heat it up you'll get all the benefits. Tuesday Breakfast: Natural yoghurt with dried fruit, honey and a good handful of hulled hemp seeds stirred in. Lunch: Busy, so have two Yaoh hemp bars - one with pineapple and coconut and the other with apple and cinnamon. Dinner: Noodle stir-fry with some very tasty hemp sauce (like soy sauce). Wednesday Brunch: Working from home so have a late brunch of hemp seed and rye toast loaded with grilled tomato, tofu and mushrooms. Dinner: A cheese and tomato topping with pancakes made from Yorkshire Hemp's pancake mix. Thursday Breakfast: I've been very organised and soaked a pack of shelled hemp seeds overnight so I can make some milk using my Yaoh milk maker. After a minute or so the machine delivers a couple of pints of the stuff. It tastes mostly of water, but is drinkable and feels very healthy. The machine can also make milk from almonds and other nuts. Lunch: Gillian McKeith hemp bar and later in the afternoon some flavoured hemp seeds from the Good company - a decent alternative to crisps and nuts. Dinner: I make a warming winter stew with lots of root veg and thicken it up with some hemp flour. Has a bit of a grainy, spicy taste and texture, not overly keen. Friday Breakfast: Make a hemp milk smoothie with bananas and strawberries Lunch: Rye/hemp bread with soup Dinner: A big salad with roast vegetables and cous cous with hemp seeds stirred in. The verdict The oil and hemp sauce are probably the most hemp popular products available at the moment. Hemp oil is quite strong, a bit like walnut oil or how you'd imagine brazil nut oil would taste. You can mix it with other oils or a bit of balsamic or white wine vinegar if you find it a bit intense on its own. I think the bars will become a regular habit, they had a good flavour and were very satisfying. Most are raw and don't contain any sugar, butter or salt, unlike most other supposed \"health\" bars. The pancakes made a good meal, as did the pasta and pesto, although it would be hard to drag me away from wholewheat pasta permanently. The milk wasn't exactly to my taste, but neither was soya milk when I first tried it, so I'll preserver and probably stick to mixing it with something sweeter. The recommended amount of hemp to get all your omegas is 100 grams of seeds or 30 grams of oil each day. I've easily managed this and think I could keep it up. You can just have a spoonful of oil if you think you haven't had your quota. I could be imagining it, but after a few weeks of keeping going with some of the foods, I'm sure I feel more alert and my nails definitely look healthier. \u00b7 A full version of this feature appears in the January issue of Lifescape magazine"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
