Allardyce said he had inherited \u201ca happy bunch not a damaged bunch\u201d but, having won his first match with Adam Lallana\u2019s stoppage-time goal in Slovakia, he also talked about the deterioration in the players\u2019 mood on the morning of the match \u2013 a legacy, he said, of what had happened in France in the summer. \u201cI think they were probably a bit nervous,\u201d Allardyce said. \u201cI saw a little nervous tension. It [Iceland] is bound to be in the back of their mind, isn\u2019t it? They had a holiday, a pre-season, started the season with their clubs and then it comes to the first England game after Iceland and maybe there was nervous tension. \u201cIt was too negative in the first 45 minutes. I think it was possession for possession\u2019s sake rather than trying to break the opposition down. That was maybe sub-conscious, players thinking: \u2018I don\u2019t want to be the one who gives that ball away.\u2019 I could see that: \u2018What if I make that pass? Oh, I don\u2019t know \u2026\u2019 But we have to be brave. \u201cI haven\u2019t asked what their biggest fear is because I didn\u2019t want to talk about fear. I wanted to be positive and tell them what the future is. The only thing I mentioned about the past was to learn from it and the only thing I said was don\u2019t feel like that again next time around.\u201d The Football Association is no longer using Steve Peters, the Liverpool club psychiatrist brought in by Roy Hodgson for England\u2019s past two tournaments, and has turned to the sports management company set up by the Olympic gold-medallist swimmer Adrian Moorhouse. One of its sports psychologists, Jonathan Zneimer, has already been involved with England teams at every age group from under-21 down and Allardyce recognises the importance of working on the players\u2019 minds after Euro 2016 ended with Greg Dyke, the FA\u2019s then chairman, saying the players \u201cfroze\u201d and \u201cwere scared\u201d. \u201cIt is different in terms of Steve Peters,\u201d Allardyce said. \u201cThis is a company with many facets in their locker. We will use them on a consistent basis to help the players build resilience so they are able to cope with pressure better. Even though they already deal with a lot of pressure, on an international stage it\u2019s a different type of pressure and they are very young. As a squad we are really young and as human beings, when we get criticised, we hurt \u2013 we really do.\u201d The pain of Euro 2016 has by no means subsided, according to Eric Dier, whose assessment of its impact on the squad somewhat contradicted Allardyce\u2019s and was a good deal more downbeat. \u201cThere is a long way to go until the scars have been healed but it is a start,\u201d the midfielder said, reflecting on the victory in Slovakia. \u201cAll we can do is win against whoever we have in front of us but I think there is a long way to go before we repay everyone for what happened in the Euros. And for ourselves as well because we were the most unhappy of everyone and there is a long way to go until we are happy again.\u201d Lallana\u2019s first international goal spared England another wave of criticism but Allardyce\u2019s team had struggled until Martin Skrtel\u2019s sending-off and benefited ultimately from a goalkeeping mistake. England did not manage a shot on target until the 64th minute and Harry Kane admitted the team\u2019s lack of confidence in the final third may be a hangover from the tournament in France. \u201cIt could be,\u201d the striker said. \u201cIt is difficult sometimes when teams like Slovakia drop off and make it very difficult to play through \u2013 you have to be very patient and make sure that ball is spot on every time.\u201d Allardyce opened himself to scrutiny after the game by declaring he had given Wayne Rooney carte blanche to play where he wanted. The manager went on to say he was surprised Rooney operated in such a deep role \u2013 \u201cHe\u2019s not to forget we want him to score goals\u201d \u2013 but it was clear the manager was willing to give his captain special privileges. \u201cI am using his experience to its maximum on the field. He has had it at Manchester United, under many different managers, playing down the right, the left, centre-forward, in behind, centre midfield. Mine and Wayne\u2019s relationship, as we grow, will always be to promote him wherever he plays.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
