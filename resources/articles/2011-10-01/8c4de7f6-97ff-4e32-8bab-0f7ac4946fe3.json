It did not matter, though. Spain still beat the Czech Republic, easing into a 2-0 lead after 23 minutes thanks to goals from Juan Mata and Xabi Alonso, before nodding off for the next 23. Victory maintained their perfect record in Group I, which spells trouble for Scotland, who were last seen beating Liechtenstein 1-0 to keep alive their hopes of reaching the play-offs. To do so, they must either win in Spain or hope they can equal the Czech Republic's result in Lithuania. Win in Spain. Good luck with that. Scotland were decent against Liechtenstein and missed a glut of chances that would have made the final score more convincing but there was nothing that would have scared the world and European champions. Their best hope is that Spain take the night off \u2013 maybe literally, because Spain should still have too much for Scotland even if they fail to get out of first gear. That is unlikely, though; with competition for places so fierce in the Spanish squad, no player will want to be seen as not trying. Come on Lithuania, then. Belgium's task is equally daunting. While they were beating Kazakhstan 4-1, the leaders of Group A, Germany, made it nine wins out of nine with a highly impressive 3-1 victory in Turkey, who are now third, a point behind Belgium. But Turkey now host Azerbaijan, meaning Belgium probably have to win in Germany, who were able to leave out Mesut Ozil against Turkey and watch smugly as the exceptional 19-year-old Mario G\u00f6tze took his place. Just like Spain, Germany are engaged in a relentless, terrifying quest for perfection and there is no sign of either of them letting up now. Bad news for Scotland, bad news for Belgium. Republic of Ireland's negativity could catch up with them \"Andorra is never an easy place to go,\" said Tony Cottee. \"You're expected to win 25-0 and that's difficult.\" On the contrary, Tony, that actually sounds like a very easy place to go to. Spain's a difficult place to go to. So are Germany, Holland and Italy. Andorra, though? Not if you're expected to win 25-0 against a side with a princely zero points from nine games. Of course, Cottee was exaggerating a tad \u2013 Andorra are not American Samoa for crying out loud \u2013 and in a sense his point was logical: getting three points from an instantly forgettable game is all that matters. Although Republic of Ireland achieved precisely that, the manner of their victory against the group minnows was deeply unimpressive and offered little encouragement before their final group match at home to Armenia on Tuesday \u2013 effectively a play-off to reach the play-offs. Republic of Ireland need only a point to confirm second place and Giovanni Trapattoni will surely be setting them up to get that point. Irish fans have regularly bemoaned their side's glaring lack of invention, complaining that they are needlessly negative when the situation calls for them to be more gung-ho. Perhaps Trapattoni is merely doing his bit to maintain an Italian stereotype, keeping up appearances if you will, but his defensive tactics could cause problems against Armenia, who attack first and worry about the consequences later. The script has been set for Tuesday's match. Republic of Ireland will defend and hope to nick a goal from somewhere, while Armenia will pour forward. And quite possibly win. After stunningly winning 4-0 in Slovakia and beating Macedonia 4-1 at home, Vardan Minasyan's youthful side are not to be taken lightly, so the dilemma for Republic of Ireland is whether to stick or twist, whether to throw caution to the wind and win by risking defeat, something Trapattoni has shown no inclination to do. He is 72 and unlikely to start changing his ways now but perhaps, if only for one night in Dublin, he should. After all, what if Republic of Ireland really did use up all their luck in Russia? This is a good time to be Welsh 1958 was a significant year in the world of football. Pel\u00e9 became the youngest player to feature and score in a World Cup final, Real Madrid won a third successive European Cup and the Munich air disaster happened. But that is not all. 1958 was also the last time Wales got to a major international tournament, losing in the quarter-final of the World Cup to Brazil, Pel\u00e9 scoring the only goal. Never mind 45 years of hurt, try 53. Now there is a growing feeling that Wales could be on the verge of a momentous period in their history, a belief backed up by wins over Montenegro and Switzerland and a spirited performance in the defeat by England, when only a preposterous miss from Robert Earnshaw prevented them from grabbing a draw. Their scorers against Switzerland were Aaron Ramsey and Gareth Bale, two of the most prized youngsters in Europe and a pair on whom Gary Speed will greatly depend in the coming years. Wales will not be at Euro 2012 but their recent results will give them plenty of encouragement for the World Cup 2014 qualifiers, where they are in a group with Croatia, Serbia, Belgium, Scotland and Macedonia. that is difficult but not daunting. Not since Mark Hughes was in charge of the national side and they were beating Italy and Germany at the Millennium Stadium has there been so much optimism surrounding Wales. A young team will need to be given time to grow, although happily for Speed there are more youngsters to introduce, such as the highly rated Crystal Palace midfielder Jon Williams. More of a challenge, however, will be dealing with the greater levels of expectation, not to mention performing when the pressure is on, rather than when there is nothing left to play for. Andrea Pirlo: still got it Andrea Pirlo has arguably been the closest thing to Xavi over the past decade \u2013 excluding the countless mini-Xavis being produced on a daily basis at La Masia \u2013 yet, although only a year separates them in age, the pair's career paths have wildly diverged of late. While Xavi was celebrating yet another Champions League in the summer, Pirlo was suffering the ignominy of being cast aside by Milan, who decided the Italian playmaker could no longer stand the pace after 10 years at San Siro and let him go to Juventus. There cannot be anything more humiliating than Milan deciding you are too old. It is like being given fashion tips from a golfer. Their decision was not difficult to understand, though. Since winning the World Cup with Italy in 2006 and the Champions League in 2007 with Milan, Pirlo had gradually been on the wane, finding himself increasingly overrun in his deep-lying midfield role, especially as Gennaro Gattuso was no longer able to do his running for him. The reason Xavi survives and excels in today's frenetic midfield battle is because he is always on the move as soon as he releases the ball, whereas Pirlo is more stately, more aloof, more, well, Italian. Slower, basically, but that is largely a result of his role as a sitter and the more sedate nature of the game in Italy. However, his move to Juventus, who are the early leaders in Serie A, appears to have reinvigorated one of the classiest midfielders around and during Friday's draw against Serbia, his performance was labelled \"impeccable\" by Gazzetta Dello Sport, who also named him man of the match. \"Tick Tock, Tick Tock, it's the Pirlo watch,\" they wrote. \"Entrusting him with the ball is like investing in German federal bonds.\" Quite. Indeed Pirlo recorded the most amount of passes attempted out of anyone involved in the match (81) and completed 72. He still has it. Rejoice. Maybe 4-4-2 is not dead After England stank out the last World Cup, the consensus was very much 4-4-2 is dead, long live 4-2-3-1, mostly because it was the formation used by Germany and Spain. There tends to be a loud reactive voice in England which emerges when things take a turn for the worse (so every two years or so) and latches on to what the successful sides are doing, almost like a status symbol. The problem is that not too much thought goes into how it might work; just bung the best players together and they will sort it out, right? There's nothing wrong with tactical innovation and inspiration \u2013 indeed it should be celebrated and admired \u2013 but intelligent players are required to implement it. In any case Laurent Blanc does not seem too opposed to using a 4-4-2 with France. Admittedly it was only a home match against Albania, not the sort of fixture that will notify the rest of Europe about France's impending revival, even if they did win 3-0. However the fact that European sophisticates, whom England are so desperate to emulate, are willing to use the system surely indicates that it is very much alive. Against Albania Blanc opted to use Florent Malouda and Samir Nasri in the wide positions, Yohan Cabaye and Yann M'Vila in the centre and Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my and Baf\u00e9timbi Gomis up front. The result was a comfortable 3-0 victory. This does not mean that every side should line up like this or even that France will against Bosnia on Tuesday night, yet Blanc decided that both the opposition and the players at his disposal offered him that option. What comes first, the formation or the players? Well, think of it this way: playing in a 4-2-3-1 is not going to turn Gareth Barry into Andr\u00e9s Iniesta."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
