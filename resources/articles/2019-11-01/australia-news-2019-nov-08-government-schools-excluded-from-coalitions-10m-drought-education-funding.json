The Australian Education Union\u2019s president, Correna Haythorpe, said it was \u201canother slush fund for private schools\u201d on top of the $1.2bn Choice and Affordability fund for Catholic and independent schools, which also included money for drought-affected areas. On Thursday the education minister, Dan Tehan, announced the Coalition would provide \u201c$10m for schools that are impacted by drought so that they can provide relief to families\u201d \u2013 modelled on its response to the Queensland floods \u2013 and an extra $5m for childcare centres. He said the funding would address \u201cthe impact on parents of drought and worrying whether they\u2019ll \u2026 be able to continue to afford to send their children to school\u201d and the toil and hardship parents suffer paying school fees. The education department has specified the $10m is only for non-government schools as a \u201csupplementary financial source for schools\u201d which have \u201cintroduced fee relief and/or curtailed their operations to cope with this drastic situation\u201d. Haythorpe told Guardian Australia the measure was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and further evidence the Morrison government only considers the needs of non-government schools. \u201cWe have thousands of government schools \u2013 more than 80% of students in rural and remote areas are in public schools and they are deeply impacted by drought,\u201d she said. It was an \u201celitist argument\u201d that only parents in non-government schools needed fee relief which \u201crelied on the stereotype that farmers all send their kids to boarding and private schools\u201d. \u201cTo privilege one sector over another is to further entrench a level of inequality,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you recognise there is a genuine need, surely you would deliver funding to all sectors [and] not make the package elitist and exclusive?\u201d Labor\u2019s education spokeswoman, Tanya Pliberksek, said it was \u201cterrific that schools will get some extra help during the drought\u201d but said: \u201cWhat about public schools? \u201cPublic schools students and parents are struggling through this terrible drought, too. What is Scott Morrison going to do to help them?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
