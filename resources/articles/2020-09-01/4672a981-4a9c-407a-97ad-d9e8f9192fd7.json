A separate analysis found that during the entire month of August only 4% of broadcast news wildfire coverage mentioned climate crisis. Wildfires are raging in states across the American west, burning record acreage in California, Washington and Oregon. The wave of fires was first sparked and stoked by a spate of unusual weather in August, including rare lightning storms that hit parts of California that were vulnerable to fire because drought and heat had dried out vegetation. The fires came before low-elevation, coastal parts of the state reached peak fire season in the autumn when fierce offshore winds have driven the biggest fires in recent years. The fires that hit Oregon in recent days were stoked by dry conditions and rare easterly winds. Although untangling the weather conditions from climate crisis is complicated, it\u2019s clear that overall, in recent years \u201cfire risk is increasing dramatically because of climate change\u201d, said Chris Field, who directs the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. Global heating has given rise to drier, hotter conditions and more frequent, extreme droughts that have left the landscape tinder-dry and prone to explosive blazes. Although California\u2019s landscape has long been prone to fire, climate crisis has \u201cput pressure on the entire system\u201d, Field said, throwing it out of balance and giving rise to more extreme, catastrophic events. The current fires expanding with such explosive force have burned more acreage within a few weeks than what has burned in previous years. A consensus of research has made clear that extreme heat and drought fueled by global heating has left the American west tinder-dry and especially vulnerable to runaway fires. A 2019 study found that from 1972 to 2018, California saw a five-fold increase in the areas that burned annually. Another study estimates that without human-caused climate crisis, the area that burned between 1984 and 2015 would have been half of what it actually was. And a research paper published last month suggests that the number of autumn days with \u201cextreme fire weather\u201d \u2013 when the risk of wildfires is extremely high \u2013 has more than doubled over the past two decades. \u201cOur climate model analyses suggest that continued climate change will further amplify the number of days with extreme fire weather by the end of this century,\u201d the researchers write, \u201cthough a pathway consistent with the UN Paris commitments would substantially curb that increase.\u201d Climate crisis is not the only factor driving the barrage of blazes across the region. Ironically, a century of suppressing fires \u2013 extinguishing the natural, necessary fires in western forests and other wildlands to protect homes and timber \u2013 has led to an accumulation of fire-fueling vegetation. \u201cA deficit of fire, concatenated with the effects of climate change have led us here,\u201d said Don Hankins, a fire ecologist at California State University, Chico. Media Matters singled out two TV news journalists who are regularly talking about the role of climate crisis: the CBS meteorologist and climate specialist Jeff Berardelli and NBC\u2019s Al Roker. The Media Matters analysis also noted that so far, 2020 has been the third year in a row during which corporate broadcast TV news discussed the impacts of climate crisis in fewer than 5% of wildfire segments."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
