But since the likes of Hebden Bridge\u2019s Trades Club became venues, they\u2019ve been full of young people; Sydney Minsky-Sargeant even named his band in tribute. He was a Trades Club regular before studying songwriting at Manchester\u2019s BIMM Institute. There, in late 2017, he befriended original Working Men\u2019s Club bandmates Jake Bogacki and Giulia Bonometti. Their first single, Bad Blood/Suburban Heights, was released early this year on Manchester label Melodic. It was delicious: an urgent 21st-century take on the Fall with added tunefulness, along with some twisted early REM jangle. Heavenly signed the band four months later. They\u2019re now a little different, with guitars and synths courtesy of the Moonlandingz\u2019 Mairead O\u2019Connor and Drenge\u2019s Rob Graham, and Liam Ogburn on the post-punk basslines. New single Teeth has darker electronic elements reminiscent of Suicide and Soft Cell. Minsky-Sargeant is refreshingly outspoken. One of the band\u2019s newer songs, Cook a Coffee, is a sweary takedown of journalist Andrew Neil; Minsky-Sargeant has described him as \u201ca rightwing piece of shit\u201d. A headline tour and a forthcoming support slot to Fat White Family promises more unseemliness. \u201cWe just want to confuse the fuck out of people, in a good way,\u201d Minsky-Sargeant says. We\u2019ll raise 10 overflowing pints to that. Teeth is out now. Working Men\u2019s Club\u2019s UK tour continues on Thursday 7 November at the Waterfront Studio, Norwich"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
