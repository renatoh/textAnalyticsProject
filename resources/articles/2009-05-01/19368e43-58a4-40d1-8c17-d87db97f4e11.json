Those who hastened from the grandstand to the winner's enclosure after the Lockinge Stakes were expecting to see one of Frankie Dettori's flying dismounts, his well-established celebration routine after winning a Group One race. Instead came the announcement that the Italian's mount, Alexandros, had in fact been pipped by Virtual. Rather than jumping in the air, Dettori held his head in his hands as he rode into the spot reserved for the runner-up, in apparent acknowledgement of the dropped whip that could have made all the difference. Alexandros had been one of three in a line at the furlong pole, with Dettori waving his whip alongside the horse's head, when it was clubbed from his hand by Tom Queally in the act of giving third-placed Twice Over a backhander. The replay revealed an almost comic moment as Dettori appeared to register that his hand was empty before he lowered himself behind Alexandros's neck and pushed for the line. Had it been slightly nearer or slightly further away, victory would still have been theirs. But, with cruel timing, Virtual lowered his head at just the right moment and seized the first prize of \u00a3142,000 at odds of 6-1. \"I was gutted when I passed the line because I thought I was beat,\" said the winning rider, Jimmy Fortune. \"And you normally know. \"I was probably beat a half-stride before the line and a half-stride after. He's very tough. They came at him from all angles a furlong and a half out and he stuck his head down. He's very game.\" For Virtual's trainer, John Gosden, this was a welcome change of luck after some recent frustrations. He had appeared crushed by the unplaced effort of his 8-11 favourite Rainbow View in the 1,000 Guineas, since when both Debussy and Nehaam had run below expectations in trials for the Derby. Like Fortune, he had been convinced that Virtual was beaten until the result was announced and was so delighted by the outcome that he loudly and repeatedly compared his jockey to Laffit Pincay, the former champion of America who held the world record for most wins by a rider at his retirement in 2003. The Eclipse at Sandown on 4 July will be Virtual's next target. The colt was well beaten in a handicap at Royal Ascot last year and Gosden now takes the view that the course does not suit. He may have a strong hand in the Eclipse, as Pipedreamer, who runs in the same colours, also has the race on his agenda. For Godolphin, the last-gasp defeat of Alexandros was a real blow. The decline in recent years of Sheikh Mohammed's operation has been well-documented but this race, which is usually among the weaker Group Ones, provided a partial face-saver last year, when Creachadoir carried the royal blue colours to victory. Simon Crisford, Godolphin's spokesman, was among those who felt sure the photo-finish would go their way, so it is all the more to his credit that he put such a brave face on Dettori's lost whip, denying that it had played any part in the outcome. \"Some horses run for the whip and some don't,\" he said. \"This is an honest horse who gives everything anyway.\" Alexandros will now have his sights lowered to Group Three level in the Diomed Stakes at Epsom on Oaks day. Meanwhile the beaten favourite, Paco Boy, goes for the Queen Anne at the Royal meeting. The question of whether he has the stamina for a top-class mile race will again be an issue then. He clearly ran out of puff here, fading into fourth, but connections were quick to identify the rain-softened going as the decisive factor. \"A mile for him on good ground is not a problem,\" declared his trainer, Richard Hannon. But many of the punters who lined up behind Paco Boy here are likely to be more cautious next time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
