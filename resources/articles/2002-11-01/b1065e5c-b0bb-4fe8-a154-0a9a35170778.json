It is no surprise to learn that Jay Berman (Feedback, November 21) represents the views of the \"Phonographic Industry\", a term coined in 1835. His response to the concept of file sharing is both reactionary and lacking in lucid argument. Copyright material has been copied for as long as copyright material has existed. Instead of reiterating the same lame arguments about \"cynical profiteering\", it would be refreshing to hear some innovative thinking coming from the music industry. Let's get a few things straight about file sharing. Generally speaking (and at least until broadband is truly widely available), the process is long winded and somewhat hit and miss. It delivers sound that is not true CD quality, and the software used represents a virus risk and is packed with irritating pop-up advertising (and worse). Despite all the disadvantages, I do use Kazaa. And guess what? My average spend on legitimate music has increased by some 150% as a result. Downloading an album across the web isn't worth the effort for most of us. However, I regularly download sample tracks. Sorry, David Gray, I downloaded a copy of your single Sail Away a few months ago. I liked it so much that I went straight out and bought the CD. Sorry, McAlmont &amp; Butler, I downloaded your single Falling recently. I didn't like it, won't buy the CD, and will probably never listen to it again. When will this industry get real? The digitisation of the media has happened and what a fabulous marketing opportunity it offers. Let's see less money wasted on doomed attempts to control the technology and more thought put into ways of providing content-rich products in advance of the widespread availability of broadband. Current users of phonographs are excused from trying to understand the foregoing arguments. Duncan Parks (email address supplied) Beware geeks Azeem Azhar claims that Apple's introduction of its new, Unix-based OS X operating system has helped it attract a new constituency of \"uber-geeks\". As a formerly rabid Mac loyalist, I find this worrying. Presumably, these are the same \"uber-geeks\" who preferred Windows in the past because it offered so many opportunities - virtually necessities - for tinkering with the machine. Presumably these same \"uber-geeks\" are now delighted to have access to Unix - an ancient, arcane OS originally written to run telephone exchanges in the 60s - on their desktop. Apple's new OS X barely conceals the horrendous complexity of Unix, with which one is forced to grapple given the inevitable teething problems of the new system. This complexity is the antithesis of what the Mac revolution was meant to be about. It's a new OS all right, but I don't think it's a Mac OS in anything but name. Adrian Langford adrian@qualitative.co.uk Picture this I've been havering about digital cameras, waiting for the right price/quality, and meanwhile find that taking film photographs and using a scanner to send pictures by email or keep them in my computer, I can still also keep my high quality photographs. Best of both worlds. In fact, I take my scanner with me on my travels, and not only scan and send photographs, but postcards as well, or anything else of interest. Maybe I won't get a digital camera, after all... Constantine de Goguel congee@btinternet.com Slow speed I read this article with great interest, especially since I recently bought a Canon Powershot S45. The literature warned me about shutter speed, so I was prepared for this drawback. However, I was not prepared for what I can only describe as the \"effective film speed\". For the S45 this is disappointingly slow: in anything but really bright conditions I find the shutter speed is set to 1/30 sec or less and I'm being warned about camera shake! As far as I know there is no attribute that specifies this critical characteristic. The only solution is to use a tripod for landscape photos - something I never have to do using 200 ASA film in a film camera! Peter F Smith peter@earlsdon.free-online.co.uk Scam battle The article on Nigerian 419 scams (November 21) failed to mention how recipients of such emails can help combat it. The National Criminal Intelligence Service has a dedicated address: 419@spring39.demon.co.uk) to which copies of such emails (including full headers!) can be sent. Every constabulary in the UK also has a dedicated officer to whom such communications can be forwarded. Nat Queen n.m.queen@birmingham.ac.uk Tablet cure The combination of a wireless connection and a Tablet PC (Feedback, November 21) could have no better application than patients' notes in hospitals. Doctors and nurses could share the information (without the need to find the wedge of papers) and the results from labs and X-rays could be added directly to each record. Handwritten or typed notes could be added, and searched by the hospital staff. Letters or emails could be written on the same device.
