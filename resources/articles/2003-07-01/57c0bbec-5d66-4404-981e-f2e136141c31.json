All you fund managers, stock brokers, research analysts, pensions advisers, and general financial gurus - go and find something useful to do. Take up farming, or go to work in a factory, or lay bricks - anything, apart from investing in the stock market. As our resident market historian David Schwarz explains in his article today (link below), you are adding virtually nothing to the greater good of mankind. For nearly two centuries, adjusting for inflation and without re-investing dividends, your efforts on behalf of investors have produced a return less than could be had from putting the cash in the building society. For a lot of the time, especially the first quarter of the twentieth century, sliding it under the mattress would have been a better investment strategy. Schwarz's innovatory analysis should start a debate on the very nature of our financial system, but one thing is certain - the masters of the universe have had it lucky the past 25 years, and, if history is any judge, that luck is about to run out. Luc puts fat cats on their Marks Marks &amp; Spencer's Luc Vandevelde had so many pats on the back last week from the press that his shoulders must be aching, but it is only right to congratulate him on turning round his image so successfully - to go from Belgian fat cat to selfless saviour of Britain's retailing flagship is no mean feat. His decision to take his salary in shares may be impractical for all to follow. He is already a wealthy man, and has no immediate need of the readies, so he can let the \u00a344,000 per month - at last week's price - just pile up in the bank. Other directors in more straitened circumstances might have difficulty explaining that they did not really mean the last sale to reflect their lack of confidence in the company - they just had to pay the school fees or the paddock charges. And it would mean a pretty spartan Christmas for the wives and children of fat cats - the festive season usually coincides with a closed period, when they could not sell at all. But the M&amp;S boss has sent a powerful message to Britain's boardrooms: put your money where your mouth is. Will the message get through to Jean-Pierre Garnier of Glaxo? I doubt it. Roman holiday at Chelsea for now Despite the many thousand of words that have been written on Roman Abramovich, nobody in the UK press has yet satisfactorily explained to me the basic question: why has this Russian billionaire shelled out for Chelsea football club? So I'm grateful to Russian journalist Valentin Anokhin, of the magazine Russky Fokus, for the most plausible explanation yet. By a stroke of luck, Anokhin managed to get an interview with Boris Berezovsky - the exiled Russian oligarch who was Abramovich's patron in his formative years - just after the Chelsea deal and as other Russian businessmen were being treated to the wrath of President Putin. 'When the regime sets out to get Abramovich,' Berezovsky tells the magazine, 'everyone will say \"That's the guy who bought Chelsea\". As I see it, this purchase is for the purpose of Abramovich's defence, rather than business or anything else.' Chelsea fans, who were delighted last week when every day seemed to bring a new international player to the club for a multimillion pound fee, will have to pray that Abramovich's 'defence' is watertight, or that he stays on the right side of the Russian president for the forseeable future. Incidentally, it is not a new strategy to invest in football when things are looking a bit tricky at home. Dermot Desmond, the Irish millionaire who controls Glasgow's Celtic, once confided that he bought his first shares in the club when he was going through a little period of difficulty in Dublin. It worked for him - Desmond has since gone from strength to strength, and now looks untouchable at home. The same cannot be said for Abramovich. Richard Wild I must offer my condolences to the family and friends of Richard Wild, the freelance journalist who was murdered in Baghdad last week. Earlier this year, I had a phone call out of the blue from a keen-sounding researcher at ITN, who had come up with a story idea in the course of his work vetting video footage from the war in Iraq. Richard wanted to describe the raw emotions and experiences of troops involved in the conflict, and depict their actions as seen through the TV lens alongside their recorded words. His copy and images, as published on the Observer's Media pages, were lean, emotive and heartrending - the next best thing to 'being there' I have read on the conflict. As far as I'm aware, it was his only published piece of journalism. His commitment to 'telling it straight' led him to Baghdad, where, even in the short time he was there, he impressed seasoned correspondents with his enthusiasm and talent. This fine young man, with a great career ahead of him, will be sadly missed.
