The England stand-off made a complaint after tackling Craig Huby early in the second half. The referee Ian Smith confirmed that the incident would be included in his official report, but the Rugby Football League's video review panel found no conclusive evidence when the incident was studied yesterday, and no disciplinary action will be taken against Huby after Pryce indicated that he is happy to let the matter rest. On Thursday, Pryce faces a sentencing hearing with his former Bradford team-mate Stuart Reardon \u2013 now of Hull \u2013 after they pleaded guilty last month to assault."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
