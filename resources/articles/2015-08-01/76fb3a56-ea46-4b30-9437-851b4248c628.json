The Brentford manager Marinus Dijkhuizen\u2019s decision to make 11 changes was ruthlessly exploited by fourth-tier United, with Liam Sercombe, Danny Hylton, Roofe and Jon Mullins securing a comprehensive victory. \u201cIt was an embarrassing performance from my team,\u201d said Dijkhuizen. \u201cAfter 12 minutes it was nil-three and game over. It was a long night for me but also for the crowd especially, and for my players. There were a lot of lessons tonight for me and for the players. That\u2019s a good thing. The bad thing is we played awful.\u201d A manic opening 12 minutes settled this first-round clash, with Sercombe taking aim from the edge of the box and firing home a low, right-footed shot to start an embarrassing night for the Bees. That fifth-minute effort was followed by a comical second as Jack Bonham\u2019s clearance deflected in off Hylton, before Roofe sent the 903 visiting fans into raptures \u2013 taking aim from 40 yards after the Bees back-up goalkeeper strayed off his line. Ryan Taylor had chances to make it worse in a one-sided first half \u2013 a pattern which continued after the interval, when clever, unselfish team play allowed Mullins to convert and wrap up a great United win. Tom Bradshaw powered Walsall into the second round in dramatic fashion as he crashed home a stoppage-time penalty to seal his hat-trick and beat Nottingham Forest 4-3 at the City Ground, with the beaten manager Dougie Freedman admitting after the game that he had \u201cfinally reached the end of his tether\u201d with some of his players. \u201cI am bitterly disappointed,\u201d said Freedman, whose side lost their opening league fixture at Brighton on Friday. \u201cWe fought very hard towards the end and got back in the game and looked the stronger team but unfortunately we gave the penalty away, which I had no arguments with. \u201cThere is a lack of individual desire at the moment to keep the ball out of the back of the net and it has cost us once again. It is very difficult concede four goals and win a match. There has got to be changes in personnel, simple as that.\u201d Bradshaw had Walsall 2-0 up inside 14 minutes, but Tyler Walker reduced the deficit on his first start for Forest. Romaine Sawyers fired the League One side 3-1 ahead and \u2013 despite the Forest substitute Michail Antonio\u2019s brilliant late double \u2013 up stepped Bradshaw to send the Saddlers through. Forest had been 3-1 down with 10 minutes to play, only for Antonio\u2019s superb run and wonderful finish to bring them back into the game \u2013 \u201cYou will never see another goal like that in 10 years,\u201d said Freedman \u2013 and the substitute\u2019s cheeky backheel in injury-time drew them level. But the hosts pressed on and Kelvin Wilson was penalised for a foul on Bradshaw late on and he stepped up and sent Dorus de Vries the wrong way from the spot. Burnley, despite making just four changes to the side that started their league campaign with a 1-1 draw at Leeds on Saturday, were disappointing in a 1-0 defeat to Port Vale. Byron Moore scored the only goal in the 82nd minute, the referee\u2019s assistant deciding the ball had just crossed the line before being cleared. \u201cCredit to them because they worked hard to get the result. I felt we did a lot of things well, but we didn\u2019t have that edge in the top third of the pitch and have conceded towards the end,\u201d said the Burnley manager, Sean Dyche. \u201cVale had hardly created a chance, but they\u2019ve scored a scruffy one and it\u2019s proved enough for them. The team I put out should have been good enough to win a football match. No disrespect to anyone or the competition, but we know what prize we want this season and cup runs aren\u2019t our priority.\u201d Burton Albion, who beat both Wigan and QPR in last season\u2019s competition, scored a deflected 87th-minute winner to add Bolton to their list of recent conquests. Wanderers would have had a half-time lead had Gary Madine converted the simple headed chance he was presented with when Remi Matthews\u2019s save from Liam Feeney\u2019s free-kick looped up to him. However, from just four yards out, the former Sheffield Wednesday striker, who was denied a first Bolton goal at the weekend by the woodwork, planted his attempt on to the top of the crossbar, with the ball kissing the bar again before being cleared. Aside from a deflected Lucas Akins try over the top, Burton did not threaten until Ben Amos rushed out to repel Crystal Palace loanee Jerome Binnom-Williams early in the second period. The home side dominated for much of the second half, but Madine scooped well over the top following a mazy Mark Davies run, Neil Danns\u2019 free-kick was pushed out and Zach Clough\u2019s wayward effort hit the corner flag. At the other end John Mousinho drove straight at Amos, and Feeney and Dorian Dervite did likewise when up against Matthews at the other end, before the Brewers finally found the net with three minutes remaining. Palmer fired an effort at the Wanderers goal from the edge of the box and a big deflection caused the ball to divert beyond Amos as he lay stranded on the ground. The night\u2019s other Championship casualties were Blackburn, who lost 2-1 at home to Shrewsbury with all the goals coming in the opening 32 minutes, Huddersfield, who took a 35th-minute lead at home to Notts County only for Liam Noble to score two long-range goals to secure victory, and Bristol City, beaten 3-1 at Luton, for whom the summer recruit Jack Marriott, a free transfer from Ipswich, scored twice on his full debut."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
