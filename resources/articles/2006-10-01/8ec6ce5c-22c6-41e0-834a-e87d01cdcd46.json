The institute is close to home and it has a good reputation. The tutors are all experienced writers who have been in the industry, so that helps a lot. We're looking at the different types of newspapers, and we've done shorthand, intros to stories and how to write articles. We're also learning about the laws of journalism: what you can write and what you can't. We haven't done any editing or proofreading yet, but I've only been on the course for a month. Learning the shorthand is getting easier - it's completely new to me and I'm finding it a wee bit more difficult than I expected. At the moment, I can do about 60wpm. I'm really enjoying writing articles. I love writing. I always loved English at school, and started writing stories and stuff at primary school. I'm doing a work placement for one day a week from November for the rest of the year. I haven't organised it yet, but I'm hoping to work on a newspaper close to home and get to see the day-to-day running and how things work. I'm really looking forward to it; it's what attracted me to the course. There are loads of good facilities at the college: there's a newsroom with computers and there are cameras avail able. We can take a photography module as part of the course - I'm thinking about doing it because I love taking photos too. You can also do sub-editing, but I'm not as interested in that. The course is one year long and 87% of people who complete it are working in the industry within six months. I'm hoping to get a job on a local newspaper. \u00b7 Amanda Doherty, 18, is doing an NVQ level 4 in newspaper journalism at the North West Institute of Further and Higher Education, Londonderry"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
