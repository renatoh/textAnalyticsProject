The 22-year-old striker had been keen to join Tottenham last summer and went so far as to submit a written transfer request, but the deal fell apart causing acrimony on all sides. The bad blood has since cooled, between both Berahino and the West Brom chairman, Jeremy Peace, and Peace and his Tottenham counterpart, Daniel Levy. A channel of communication has been established between the clubs and it is understood that Peace and Levy will sit down at the end of the season to resolve the transfer in good faith. That was conspicuously absent last summer, when Levy antagonised Peace with four bids for Berahino, all of which were rejected. The final one, according to Tottenham, was worth \u00a325m \u2013 the price at which West Brom were said to be prepared to do business \u2013 but it came too late on deadline day. West Brom disputed that it was worth that much and were unhappy about the manner in which Levy proposed to structure his payments, not to mention the timing of the offers. With his transfer request rejected, Berahino was left to despair and tweeted his frustration just before the window closed, saying that he did not intend to play again for Peace\u2019s club. Tottenham would have liked to take Berahino in January but it was made clear to them, and everybody else, that West Brom would not sell. Peace was worried at the time about relegation, and he turned down bids from Stoke City and Newcastle United. There is now the acceptance that Berahino, whose West Brom contract expires in June 2017, can leave. He is considered to have done his bit by working hard on his game and publicly burying the hatchet with Peace. Berahino gave an interview to West Brom\u2019s official website on the Friday before last in which he stressed his relationship with the manager, Tony Pulis, had always been good and that everything was fine with Peace. \u201cI get on really well with the chairman, so there is no problem there,\u201d Berahino said. \u201cI have always got on with the chairman. \u201cMy tweet was something that I look back on and I really regret. I should never have said that. I am human. We all makes mistakes and I hold my hand up and say it was a mistake from me. I just apologise to all the fans out there that have always supported me and the club that has always believed in me.\u201d Berahino, who has been capped at Under-21 level by England, is back in Pulis\u2019s starting XI and has seven goals in all competitions for the club this season. He scored 20 for them last time out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
