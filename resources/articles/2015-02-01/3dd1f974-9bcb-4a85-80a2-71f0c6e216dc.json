Adebayor was one of a number of players who either wanted to leave White Hart Lane last month or were the subject of intense speculation. In the end, he was denied a loan move to West Ham United \u2013 the Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, refused to sanction it because of the ill feeling between the clubs \u2013 while Youn\u00e8s Kaboul, \u00c9tienne Capoue and Paulinho also stayed. Aaron Lennon pushed for a loan move and got it on deadline day \u2013 to Everton \u2013 and he followed Kyle Naughton out of the club, the right-back having completed a permanent \u00a35m transfer to Swansea City earlier in the month. Pochettino has found himself caught in the middle of the situation between Adebayor, Levy and the club\u2019s fans, some of whom have booed the striker, partly because of the comments he made after the home loss to Stoke City on 9 November, when he said that there was a negative atmosphere at White Hart Lane. However, before Saturday\u2019s north London derby at home to Arsenal, Pochettino said that it was time for everybody to pull together and for each player to remember the terms of his contract. \u201cMaybe only the 11 players who play are happy,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cThis is football. Sometimes, there are players like Aaron who was very honest with me. He said: \u2018I accept your decision but I want to play more, and I have the possibility to go to another club, and I want to go\u2019. I said: \u2018OK\u2019. It\u2019s true I never promised my players that they will play. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to identify the players who aren\u2019t happy because they\u2019ve not played much in the last few months. But we are a club. And when you sign a contract as a player, you need to understand that you don\u2019t sign to play, you sign to train. And then the club signs a manager or head coach to pick the players. This is football.\u201d Pochettino said that Lennon was the only player who had been to see him to inform him that he wanted to leave. With Adebayor, he said, it had become a club matter \u2013 in other words, one for Levy \u2013 but Pochettino said that he was pleased with how the situation had ended up, even though Adebayor remains at the bottom of the pecking order up front. \u201cI knew he could go and I would have been happy to play with two strikers [Harry Kane and Roberto Soldado] for the rest of the season,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cPossibly, we could have used [Nacer] Chadli or [Erik] Lamela [up front] but the first thing was that I wanted to keep Adebayor. It is important to clarify that. \u201cIt\u2019s important that the fans forget the past. We are in a key moment. We need to put out the bad things, the bad energy and try to help each other. Adebayor is much better, he is a long way towards recovering his confidence but, after that, it\u2019s my decision, a football decision.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
