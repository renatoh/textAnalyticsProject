Many more across the country had already begun watching The Interview from the safety of their homes, after an unprecedented decision by Sony to make the movie available for rental online on Christmas Eve. Sony controversially cancelled its holiday screenings of The Interview earlier this month after the company was hacked in an attack the FBI linked to North Korea. Sony changed course on Tuesday and announced it had arranged a limited released of the movie in hundreds of cinemas across the country. The reversal followed days of intense criticism of the studio\u2019s decision to cave to the threats. The critics included president Barack Obama, who last week told reporters: \u201cWe cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States.\u201d While the major cinema chains are still not screening the film, its release is proving a boon to smaller and independent theaters. Sony will also profit from the decision to make the movie available online, through platforms such as Youtube Movies and Xbox Video. From 1pm ET on Wednesday, the movie could be streamed for $5.99 and purchased for $14.99, including from a dedicated website set-up by Sony. The storm of controversy over the delayed released has propelled the picture into one of the most talked-about movies of the year. Tickets for the limited screenings sold out within hours or even minutes. The slapstick film, which stars Seth Rogen and James Franco, could be given a wider release if this week\u2019s hastily-arranged screenings pass without incident. \u201cIt has always been Sony\u2019s intention to have a national platform on which to release this film,\u201d said Sony Pictures chair and CEO Michael Lynton in a statement Wednesday. \u201cIt was essential for our studio to release this movie, especially given the assault upon our business and our employees by those who wanted to stop free speech. We chose the path of digital distribution first so as to reach as many people as possible on opening day, and we continue to seek other partners and platforms to further expand the release.\u201d The provenance of the cyber-attack that resulted in the release of confidential Sony emails and threats against moviegoers who watch the film is subject to dispute. A group calling itself the Guardians of Peace has claimed responsibility for the lengthy and coordinated attack. The FBI said the group was connected to North Korea and lay the blame with the regime. But some security and hacking experts have raised doubts over whether the the methods used in the attack match those associated with North Korea\u2019s autocracy. North Korea has denied involvement in the attack on Sony and accused the US government of helping devise the inflammatory plot about two journalists who travel to North Korea to assassinate Kim Jong-un."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
