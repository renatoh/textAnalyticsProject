Donald Trump was about to launch a New York office block, and he asked Soros to be his lead tenant. Soros was already a spectacularly successful financier, but told Trump he simply couldn\u2019t afford it. \u201cAnd that was just because I didn\u2019t like him,\u201d he tells me, smiling. It\u2019s not hard to see why Soros took such an instant dislike. Worldly, bookish, curious and somewhat shy, he tends to find other businessmen boring. He is unimpressed by celebrity, preferring the company of intellectuals, journalists and anyone he feels knows more about a given subject than he does. As a hedge fund manager, he was more likely to spend his free time reading and writing philosophy texts than hanging out on the golf course. If you had to conjure up a personality that is the polar opposite of the current president of the United States, it would look a lot like Soros. We meet on a sunny October morning in the office of his New York residence, with views over the Central Park reservoir. It could easily be the consulting room of an upmarket psychotherapist rather than the headquarters of one of the world\u2019s richest people \u2013 and, as both his critics and supporters would argue, one of the most influential. A few pieces of understated art decorate the cream-coloured walls; there are bookshelves lined with nonfiction and an air purifier hums quietly in the background. Unlike Trump Tower, just a couple of miles away down Fifth Avenue, there are no gold elevators here. These days, the distance between Trump and Soros is about much more than personality and aesthetics. The president has become the most powerful among a global chorus of rightwing critics focused on Soros\u2019s philanthropic efforts, which fund a broad range of causes they dislike, from minority rights and protecting refugees to liberalising drug policy and combating hate speech. Soros has long had enemies \u2013 largely, authoritarian leaders who were wary of his efforts to promote and protect democracy; more recently, this has been amplified by the antisemitic conspiracy theories that ooze from the darker corners of the internet. It is now rare for a week to go by without a populist politician painting Soros as a ruthless Bond villain with nefarious plans to reshape the planet. Last year, Trump suggested that Soros might be paying illegal migrants to come to the US; in Turkey, President Erdo\u011fan has called him \u201ca man who assigns people to divide nations and shatter them\u201d; in Italy, Matteo Salvini has claimed Soros wants the country \u201cto become a giant refugee camp because he likes slaves\u201d. Last month, Soros\u2019s financial support for the anti-Brexit Best for Britain group led Jacob Rees-Mogg to call him the \u201cRemoaner-in-chief\u201d in parliament. Nigel Farage has called him \u201cthe biggest danger to the entire western world\u201d. As a reporter based in eastern Europe, I have had a ringside seat to the political hostility Soros has faced over the years. I spent a decade in Russia, where Vladimir Putin blamed him for organising revolutions in neighbouring countries; in 2015, his philanthropic foundations were banned from the country as a \u201cthreat to state security\u201d. Last year I moved to Budapest, the city of Soros\u2019s birth, where the far-right Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, had taken Soros-baiting to a new level, erecting thousands of billboards featuring a cackling Soros, warning Hungarians not to let him \u201chave the last laugh\u201d. Now I sit opposite a somewhat frail, elderly man wearing a maroon cardigan, and it feels like a Wizard Of Oz moment. Is this really the power-broker feared by the world\u2019s nationalists? Soros turns 90 next year, and his face is creased with age, a distinctive banana-shaped fold of skin under each eye. He has lost much of his hearing, and visitors are given a microphone that connects directly to his hearing aid. He speaks hesitantly, often needing a few seconds to find the right word, and there is a hint of annoyance in his eyes during the pauses \u2013 as if the brain is irritated at the mouth for not articulating its thoughts fast enough. But appearances can be deceptive: Soros still maintains a busy work and travel schedule, splitting his weeks between Manhattan and upstate New York with his third wife Tamiko, and spending several months a year on the road. What sustains him, I ask, particularly given the recent intensity of the attacks he has faced? \u201cIt challenges me and therefore it energises me,\u201d he says with a smile, in his still-strong Hungarian accent. \u201cWhen I look at the list of people, or movements, or countries who are attacking me, it makes me feel I must be doing something right. I\u2019m proud of the enemies I have.\u201d Certainly his enemies make an impressive list of the world\u2019s least progressive politicians. But when Budapest, the city in which Soros lived during the Holocaust, is plastered with posters of him that seem to reprise 1930s tropes of the all-powerful, laughing Jew\u2026 doesn\u2019t that cross a line? Orb\u00e1n has been explicit in his opposition to Soros. \u201cI don\u2019t take it personally, and I certainly don\u2019t let it become a personal conflict,\u201d he says, matter-of-factly. \u201cThe difference between us is not personal but ideological, and we stand for opposite views of the world.\u201d Over the years, Soros\u2019s spending has had an impact that most private citizens could only dream of. Back in the 70s and 80s, he made money for his hedge fund faster than anyone else in the game, and soon began giving it away at the same speed. He is still worth around $8bn, even after a recent transfer of around $18bn from his personal funds to his foundations (together these currently spend an estimated $1bn a year around the globe). \u201cSpending my money on collecting paintings, it just wouldn\u2019t satisfy me,\u201d he says. But his philanthropy is not born of altruism, he admits. \u201cI have a big ego, and trying to make the world a better place is how I satisfy that ego.\u201d He began by providing money and organisational support for pro-democracy movements across the communist bloc. The first Soros foundation was launched in Hungary in 1984; a symbolic early project involved importing photocopiers to help dissident groups spread their message. It was a basic premise that was updated years later in Russia, where Soros spent nearly $100m during the 90s connecting regional universities to the internet. Since then, he has funded a range of causes around the world, from cultural programmes to transformative end-of-life medical care; the one unifying theme is that they must contribute to Soros\u2019s overall goal of promoting the \u201copen society\u201d. In a collection of essays and speeches published last month, called In Defense Of Open Society, Soros claims we are now living through a \u201crevolutionary moment\u201d. He remembers two previous such moments: the second world war and the collapse of communism, which marked the start of his philanthropy. Back in the 80s and 90s, as he pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into central and eastern Europe, he felt he was swimming with the tide. Repressive regimes fell, and the momentum seemed to be with the people and politicians who wanted more open and tolerant societies. And then, as Soros says, \u201cThe tide turned against me.\u201d Soros spends a minute trying to recall a name. He finds it, eventually \u2013 Martin Luther King Jr \u2013 and sombrely repeats his line that \u201cthe arc of the moral universe is long, but bends towards justice\u201d. Then he subverts it, with a glint in his eye. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that\u2019s true. I think you need to bend the arc.\u201d *** Born into a Jewish family in Hungary in 1930, Soros spent the second world war in hiding. His father had procured documents that gave him a false gentile identity, protecting him while German occupation forces and their Hungarian allies rounded up Jews and sent them to their deaths. In 1947, he left newly communist Hungary for Britain, where he worked in a series of menial jobs, including swimming pool lifeguard, train station porter and mannequin factory worker. In 1949, he gained admission to the London School of Economics, where he studied under the Austrian-born philosopher Karl Popper, whose concept of the open society made a lifelong impression. Popper\u2019s key distinction was between closed societies that claim to possess one, ultimate truth to which the population must submit; and open societies, which allow and even demand that citizens make their own choices. Having lived through both fascist and communist regimes, Soros became infatuated with this idea; he spent years reading and writing on the topic during his free time, and it continues to inform his philanthropic efforts. In his book, he explains that it is a principle that has to be defended again and again. \u201cOpen society will always have its enemies, and each generation has to reaffirm its commitment for it to survive.\u201d Soros moved to the US in 1956. His plan was to get a job on Wall Street, make $500,000 on the stock market, then return to London to study philosophy. He got a series of trading jobs before managing one of the first hedge funds \u2013 using investments to take both long and short positions in the market. He turned out to be too good at making money to give it up, moving in and out of different markets quickly; he has said that a key part of his success lay in acknowledging and reversing his mistakes. In 1992, Soros became famous as \u201cthe man who broke the bank of England\u201d, as his bets against sterling contributed to Black Wednesday. The British government had to withdraw the pound from the exchange rate mechanism, and Soros pocketed around $1bn, for which he was vilified by the tabloids. He has expressed no remorse for making a fortune out of currency speculation, shrugging that others would do the same if he didn\u2019t. He also claims that his personal role in Black Wednesday was exaggerated, but also that the timing suited him: he was looking for a bigger audience. \u201cI deliberately allowed it to happen in order to establish a platform from which I could speak out on other issues,\u201d he writes in the new book. \u201cAnd it worked. Suddenly I had a voice that could be heard.\u201d At the same time, Soros significantly increased his philanthropic spending. Unlike most other big bureaucratic trusts, where decisions are taken by boards, he is personally involved in the discussions about where the money goes. Talking to him, you get the sense he is driven by structural injustices far more than by individual suffering. On occasion, Soros has provided purely humanitarian aid: $50m to help the besieged citizens of Sarajevo during the Bosnian war; grants for more than 30,000 Russian scientists in the early 90s to keep their research alive. But he is most passionate when talking about long-term institutional reform than life-saving emergency assistance. When I ask what he is most proud of among all his projects, he talks about the incomplete but promising political progress made in Ukraine, where his foundation has supported a broad range of civil society programmes over decades. \u201cI always wanted successes in the near term, and with experience I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that real successes need 25 years,\u201d he says. \u201cTake a country like Ukraine: it had a number of revolutions, and they each failed, and now you had a free and fair election,\u201d he says, referring to the vote earlier this year for president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. In the 2004 Ukrainian election, exit polls conducted by a Soros foundation showed a very different result to the official count, and Viktor Yanukovych, who had \u201cwon\u201d the first vote, was forced to concede. He came back to power in 2010, before being toppled amid violent clashes in 2014. These revolutions, Soros says, were inevitable but not sufficient. \u201cDictators, if they are successful, always go too far, because there are no checks and balances to stop them\u2026 The point comes where people who have been cowed into obedience rebel, and there\u2019s a revolution. Revolutions generally don\u2019t succeed. You need to develop institutions, which is what open societies are all about.\u201d In the past, Putin has blamed Soros for sparking unrest \u2013 something he denies, but in a qualified manner that would hardly reassure the Russian president. \u201cIt was the people of the country who rebelled,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I enabled them to do it by various steps that the foundations took, like reliable exit polls.\u201d It is this approach that has so exercised his critics: few authoritarians would feel threatened by the distribution of mosquito nets or emergency food supplies; but the funding of critical media, legal aid NGOs and minority rights advocacy groups is a different matter. More recently, Orb\u00e1n has emerged from a competitive international field to become Soros\u2019s most ferocious critic. As a young anti-communist firebrand in the late 80s, Orb\u00e1n and his fellow young democrats received funding from Soros through his new Hungarian foundation. Orb\u00e1n even won a Soros-funded scholarship to study for a year at Oxford University in 1989. Three decades on, the Hungarian prime minister\u2019s media outlets refer to a \u201cSoros plan\u201d to ship millions of refugees to Europe and destroy the continent; last year, his parliament passed a \u201cStop Soros\u201d bill that, among other things, imposes a 25% tax on any organisation providing assistance to migrants. The Soros-founded Central European University has been forced to move much of its operations from Budapest to Vienna. Like many of Soros\u2019s rightwing critics, Orb\u00e1n often employs barely concealed antisemitism in his attacks. Last spring, I watched the prime minister give a speech outside the ornately beautiful parliament building, on the same square where Soros lived as a child. \u201cWe are fighting an enemy that is different from us,\u201d Orb\u00e1n told a flag-waving crowd. \u201cNot open, but hiding. Not straightforward, but crafty. Not honest, but base. Not national, but international. It does not believe in working but speculates with money; it does not have its own homeland, but feels it owns the whole world.\u201d This succinct summation of antisemitic tropes was delivered just a few hundred metres from a monument marking the place where hundreds of Jews were executed by fascists during the second world war. I asked Orb\u00e1n\u2019s spokesman, Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs, about the speech at the time and he denied it was antisemitic \u2013 even insinuating that my question was, because it implied that only Jews could be speculators. The Hungarian government\u2019s problem with Soros, he said, was that he uses NGOs for political purposes, despite having no \u201cmandate\u201d to do so. \u201cThere\u2019s a perception that if you say the word NGO, it goes without saying that it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he argued. \u201cBut that\u2019s not true.\u201d Many people \u2013 and not just rightwingers \u2013 might wonder if Kov\u00e1cs has a point. If you remove the antisemitism and political opportunism from Orb\u00e1n\u2019s attacks, is a leader like him right to fear the work of the Soros foundations? Soros shrugs, and sidesteps the question. \u201cWe are on opposite sides of our concept of a good society. I supported Orb\u00e1n because at the time he was a very active supporter of open society. But he became an exploiter and the creator of a mafia state.\u201d Soros\u2019s supporters would argue that what rightwing leaders consider \u201cpolitical interference\u201d is merely backing for freer and more tolerant societies. Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1, who was elected president of Slovakia in June, told me earlier this year that it is misguided for governments in the region to accuse Soros of political interference. A former civil society activist, \u010caputov\u00e1 has received Soros foundation grants in the past, and strikes a very different tone. \u201cThanks to the money from this organisation, a lot of good and valuable work has been done in Slovakia,\u201d she told me in April, shortly after winning the vote. \u201cMost of the grants were broadly in support of democracy, rather than trying to dictate on specific issues.\u201d But in taking a side in the Brexit debate, for example, isn\u2019t Soros straying into political ground? Yes and no, he says. \u201cIt falls into the category of what I call political philanthropy. Brexit is a process of disintegration that hurts both sides. It hurts Britain more on a pro rata basis and Europe more in absolute terms. Most importantly, European values can be better defended if the two of them are united. My contributions were not used for partisan or electoral purposes. They were used to educate the British public.\u201d *** An hour into our interview, Soros asks if we can take a break; the batteries have run out in his hearing aid. His wife Tamiko appears and they leave the room together for a couple of minutes to change them. When he returns, we get back to the subject of the man from farther down Fifth Avenue. Soros doesn\u2019t like getting personal: he is careful, even when it comes to Orb\u00e1n, to say that theirs is a battle between competing ideologies; he won\u2019t be drawn into the mudslinging. But Trump, for whom his disdain is explicit, is the exception. \u201cI think he\u2019s a brilliant confidence trickster, who has succeeded beyond his own expectations,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the fulfilment of the dream of a narcissist, and that\u2019s what carries him forward.\u201d Nevertheless, Soros thinks this combination of self-regard and insecurity has led the president to make terrible decisions. \u201cIn a way, we are lucky to have him because of the internal contradiction in him \u2013 he is his own worst enemy. He\u2019s digging his own grave, because of his addiction to narcissism.\u201d In recent years, Soros has become one of the biggest donors to Democrat causes and candidates. Of the current crop of contenders, he insists he does not want to endorse any candidate publicly: \u201cThis is not something that a major donor ought to be deciding \u2013 it should be decided by the electorate.\u201d Nonetheless, he speaks of Elizabeth Warren in glowing terms. \u201cShe has the experience and energy for the job. She understands the flaws of the prevailing system and has many innovative ideas about how to fix them. She would make mincemeat out of Trump in debates.\u201d He also likes Warren\u2019s plans for increased taxes on the rich. Despite his handsome profits, Soros considers himself a long-standing critic of the current financial system. \u201cThe disparity in wealth in the United States certainly contributed to the rise of Trump,\u201d he says. As far back as 1997, he wrote that laissez-faire capitalism, with its certainty in the supremacy of the market, was a new threat to any open society. He tells me he would levy a wealth tax on the super-rich \u2013 including himself \u2013 because it is the best way to fund the necessary spending on the climate crisis, an area where he feels Trump\u2019s presidency is a particular disaster. \u201cThere is a connection between the problems of open society and the problems of climate change... You\u2019ve got somebody like Trump who actually denies it, and that really makes it very hard to take the steps which are necessary to bring it under control,\u201d he says. Meanwhile, as the temperature of anti-Soros rhetoric has risen, his staff have been taking his safety more seriously. Last year, an explosive device was mailed to Soros\u2019s upstate New York residence. It was quickly detected and nobody was injured, but it showed that the threats to his life were not hypothetical. Has it restricted his movements? \u201cI am willing to risk my life for my ideas and beliefs when necessary, but I don\u2019t expose myself to unnecessary danger,\u201d he says. It is unlikely that he will return to Hungary while Orb\u00e1n is in power, he says, fearful that the relentless propaganda could inspire a physical attack. \u201cIt\u2019s quite dangerous because he has got some blind followers, just like Trump, and they may try to get me.\u201d A few days after we meet, Soros attends a board meeting of his US foundation, where the discussion focuses on how its work can be adapted to address the altered political landscape. Already Soros has made a $10m donation to a programme aimed at tackling the upsurge in hate crime in America. The 2020 budget for his US foundation has been set at $185m, nearly double the 2016 figure. \u201cFor the moment it\u2019s the still-unresolved crisis of the developed world that needs most of our attention,\u201d he tells me. Time is not on Soros\u2019s side, but it is widely expected that his 34-year-old son, Alex, will be his successor when it comes to running the foundations. I ask Soros if he is scared of dying. \u201cIt\u2019s the loss of consciousness that is so frightening for a person like me, who is so involved in thinking and understanding the world. But dying is a natural consequence of having been born and so it\u2019s nothing to be afraid of,\u201d he says. Is it something he thinks about a lot? \u201cOriginally, I wanted to spend my money while I am alive, but then I realised that would be very selfish. There are a lot of other people who have devoted their lives to working for the foundation and I owe it to them to allow the foundation to continue beyond my life.\u201d As is the case many times in the interview, he has answered a slightly different question to the one I asked. I leave unsure whether this is the confusion of old age or, more likely, a canny tactic to divulge information on his own terms. In his new book, Soros describes 2016 as the \u201cnadir\u201d in terms of the move away from open societies \u2013 with the vote for Brexit and the election of Trump. He tells me he now sees some signs that \u201cthe tide is turning again\u201d: there is the increasing momentum around the Trump impeachment discussion, and then there was the European parliament election earlier this year, in which nationalists did not do as well as many had feared. As someone who experienced the horrors of Nazi-occupied Europe, does he think those who draw comparisons to that era are wide of the mark \u2013 or could the world be heading to a truly dark place? \u201cWe certainly can\u2019t exclude it,\u201d he says. But that depends on all of us, he thinks. \u201cWe can\u2019t passively wait for things to go right. We have to act on our principles, even when the situation appears hopeless.\u201d \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
