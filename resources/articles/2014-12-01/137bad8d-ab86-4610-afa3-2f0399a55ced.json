At least we have the consolation of no longer having to fret about the looming spectre of Mourinho belittling Wenger\u2019s \u201cInvincible\u201d achievement; and with Liverpool and Spurs mired in even more inconsistency and Man United seeing so little return on the pitch for their \u00a3250m, fortunately we\u2019re only a couple of good results away from breathing some life back into our injury-ridden cadaver. With the gift of Monaco in the Champions League it really did feel as if Santa had come early. Highs: Demolishing Dortmund, seeing Chelsea lose. Lows : Failing to kick such a feeble Man Utd when they were down and instead presenting them with a gift-wrapped springboard for their recent success. Stars Not since the days of Ian Wright have we seen anyone in red and white demonstrate such unadulterated joie de vivre as Alexis S\u00e1nchez. Flops Maintaining his form of 2013-14 was always likely to be a stretch and it\u2019s sad that Aaron Ramsey has been injured again, just as his damp squib of a season was beginning to flicker. I would\u2019ve been equally disparaging about Cazorla but hopefully his performance against Newcastle was a turning point. The manager Knowing Koscielny had an achilles problem back in August, it\u2019s as if le Gaffer gambled our entire season on his six defender dice. I\u2019ll be a long time forgiving him for seemingly letting the personal get in the way of the pragmatic no-brainer of bringing F\u00e0bregas back. Nevertheless the recent show of support was a reaction from all those who couldn\u2019t abide the sight of a small group abusing him. Still, one bad result could end the Xmas truce. 5/10 Who would play him in a movie? Carry On\u2019s Charles Hawtrey. Aston Villa \u2013 Jonathan Pritchard \u2013 Observer reader 3/10 The NHS could save a fortune in sleeping tablets by dispensing Villa DVDs instead. David Cameron, another of the many thousands of Villa fans who\u2019ve stopped going, should take note. Our games fall into two categories. Attack-versus-defence training sessions for the big six and an undignified scramble for points against the crap 14. The latter involves heroic defending/goalkeeping and luck on the break. We\u2019ve scored two goals in 17 second halfs, down to the fact that the lads are knackered due to endlessly chasing ceded possession, and because Paul Lambert is tactically hopeless. I see more attacking coherence watching the village under-sevens. You\u2019d think the heat would be building on him given how poor the fare is. Far from it. Giving him a new contract just shows how detached the hapless owner is. So all in all, terrible. Dour 1-0 wins at Stoke, Anfield and Palace were relative highlights but there are too many low points to list. My gout, which is agony but actually less painful than watching us play, has come back due to excessive pre-match anaesthetising. It\u2019s the only way to get through a Saturday. Stars Alan Hutton\u2019s terrific form makes the manager look daft for ostracising him for years. Okore has started with promise and Clark and Baker have improved. Flops It\u2019s hard not to be a flop under this regime. The manager Oddly enough, Paul doesn\u2019t feature on my Christmas card list. Off the pitch his men have had us lurching from one embarrassing mess to another (bullygate, the Keane shambles) and on it we are the footballing equivalent of razor-blade chewing. He should have been sacked after Bradford two years back and since then he\u2019s managed to underperform even the lowest expectations. He has no redeeming football features. 2/10 Who would play him in a movie? Anyone from the cast of Clueless. Burnley \u2013 Tony Scholes \u2013 @clarets_mad 7/10 For a team that didn\u2019t win once in the first 10 games it might seem unusual to be so happy with how the season has gone. I suppose it depends on expectations \u2013 and when Garth Crooks and co are claiming that we are as good as relegated before we\u2019ve reached September you\u2019re thankful for everything you get \u2013 but we\u2019ve played well generally, and with a bit of luck would have more points. The three wins have obviously been the high points, against Hull, Stoke and Southampton \u2013 and the low was the 4-0 defeat at West Brom. Stars There have been fine performances all over the pitch. In defence Jason Shackell has been outstanding alongside Michael Duff and more recently Michael Keane. Flops None \u2013 though I\u2019m sure Lukas Jutkiewicz, who started the season up front, would have benefited from a goal. The manager Sean Dyche somehow led a small squad into the Premier League and is now giving them the confidence and belief to mix it with the big boys. We struck lucky when we appointed him. 10/10 Who would play him in a movie? An actor who sadly passed away almost four years ago: Pete Postlethwaite. Obviously not for his looks, but for one of his roles \u2013 Danny in Brassed Off. In that film the band kept on playing and went on to achieve great things because they all believed in Danny\u2019s philosophy and his leadership \u2013 and that\u2019s just what Sean has done at Burnley. Chelsea \u2013 Trizia Fiorellino \u2013 Chelsea supporters group 9.5/10 Everything is good at Stamford Bridge at the moment \u2013 the team are playing well, Jos\u00e9 is back where he is loved and appreciated, we\u2019re through to the next round of the Champions League, as well as the last four of the Capital One Cup and we\u2019re scaling the dizzy heights in the Premier League. Beating Liverpool and Arsenal was particularly satisfying for me. The Liverpool fixture becomes more toxic every season and putting an end to the circus that had manifested itself at Anfield at the end of the last campaign has just intensified their hatred and they wanted revenge so badly, but we simply put them to the sword again and moved on. Equally satisfying was the win over Arsenal \u2013 after last season\u2019s 6-0 destruction, many Gooners I knew were fearing double figures; in the end we only won by two goals but the performance was just as comprehensive. The only real low has been the defeat at Newcastle which was a lesson in complacency but may in hindsight be a blessing in disguise \u2013 the media had got the \u201cinvincibles\u201d bit between their teeth \u2026 Stars Hazard and Costa \u2013 two totally different beasts but both have made themselves almost indispensable. Hazard\u2019s movement and trickery are sublime and Costa is a monster. We\u2019ll keep feeding him raw meat and hopefully he will keep up the goals. Flops Can\u2019t really describe any of the current squad as a flop exactly but Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle has not seen as much action as he would have expected after winning the World Cup. The manager He has been true to his word \u2013 last year was about transition and this year about trophies. If I had one tiny criticism, it is that we sometimes do not put a game fully to bed when dominating. 10/10 Who would play him in a movie? A young (ish) Robert De Niro \u2013 dark, good-looking and brooding \u2013 with a bit of an edge and a nod at a Machiavellian persona. Crystal Palace \u2013 Chris Waters \u2013 @clapham_Grand 6/10 The season obviously started in the worst possible way, with Tony Pulis leaving just a couple of days before the first game, against Arsenal. It left us in a huge hole. Neil Warnock has done an OK job as his replacement \u2013 we\u2019ve been very competitive against the top sides and had good wins over Everton and Liverpool but we\u2019ve dominated too many games and come away with nothing or just one point. That\u2019s despite having a better squad than last season and it being a weaker league. Performances at home have in particular been largely disappointing: Villa, Stoke, and Sunderland being cases in point. Stars A lot of the focus has been on Yannick Bolasie and it\u2019s true that he has started to improve his consistency, though that has made him a marked man. Mile Jedinak has once again been a rock in the middle, but I\u2019d highlight James McArthur\u2019s contribution so far: he has been excellent and looks a wonderful signing. Flops Fraizer Campbell has struggled when he has played alone up front and the deadline signings of Zeki Fryers and Kevin Doyle seem utterly pointless given the level of performance and number of minutes they have spent on the pitch. And talking of the pitch \u2026 the playing surface has been dreadful this year and hasn\u2019t helped our cause at all. The manager The old warhorse has done well against the big sides but his reluctance to make potential game-changing substitutions until it is too late, plus his continual assertions that the team played well in every game when they clearly haven\u2019t, have started to irritate the Selhurst faithful a little. 6/10 Who would play him in a movie? All those Mrs Doubtfire comparisons are a bit unkind. So I\u2019ll say Sean Bean instead: proper Sheffield grit. Everton \u2013 Steve Jones \u2013 bluekipper.com 6/10 In the league we have done OK, but we definitely haven\u2019t reached the heights of last season. We\u2019re mid-table simply because we\u2019ve been dropping too many points at home \u2013 but the gap between us and fourth place is small, so the potential for putting the problems right and setting up a second-half-of-the-season resurgence is still there. The low point for us was getting knocked out of the Capital One Cup at Swansea in September, but there have been some real positives too \u2013 the biggest being finishing top of our group in the Europa League. The Everton fans have really enjoyed the games in Europe, with the trip to Wolfsburg just eclipsing the visit to Krasnodar in Russia. The stars There have been a few key performers who deserve a mention at the halfway point. James McCarthy has been outstanding in midfield, the defender John Stones, still only 20, has shown his maturity and ability, Steven Naismith has been a real leader, Kevin Mirallas has proven his class and Roberto Mart\u00ednez pulled off a real coup when he signed Samuel Eto\u2019o on a two-year deal in August. The flops Just the one. Joel Robles, who followed the manager from Wigan in 2013, has failed to show that he has what it takes to be Tim Howard\u2019s successor. The manager He\u2019s been excellent. He signed Romelu Lukaku together with Gareth Barry and has put most of the better players on long contracts. He has also given the players the confidence to play without fear. Now the focus is on what he can do in January to take us up a gear. I\u2019d like another striker. 8/10 Who would play him in a movie? Sean Connery in James Bond mode. Hull City \u2013 Rick Skelton \u2013 @HullCityLive 4/10 It\u2019s been a huge disappointment. We started well enough and put in some positive performances \u2013 and if we\u2019d held on to leads we established we would\u2019ve been up with Southampton and West Ham. Unfortunately, since picking up back-to-back draws at Arsenal and Liverpool we\u2019ve really struggled. Suddenly the right system and selection have proved hard to find and our fabulous team spirit has gone. Players who were brilliant last year like Curtis Davies and Tom Huddlestone have struggled as a result. The low point was the defeat at Burnley and the pathetic nature of it. Stars The promise of left-back Andy Robertson has been the big highlight. And the midfielder Mo Diam\u00e9 started brilliantly but injuries have slowed his progress. Flops Deadline-day loan signings Hatem Ben Arfa and Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez look like purchases scavenged from a bargain bin at the pound shop. The manager I\u2019m still a big fan. He\u2019s transformed the club from top to bottom and has brought a vision and an ethos that we didn\u2019t have before. I\u2019d stand by him even if we were relegated but he has made mistakes this season. The biggest being signing players who didn\u2019t fit the excellent group dynamic he had going. 7.5/10 Who would play him in a movie? It\u2019d be cruel to point out that the pigeon lady from Home Alone 2 is a dead ringer for Steve Bruce. But I\u2019ve said it now. Leicester City \u2013 Chris Whiting \u2013 @ChrisRWhiting 3/10 It\u2019s all been a bit surprising. We looked extremely competent until October but we\u2019ve been hapless ever since. Early points against Arsenal, Everton, Manchester United and Stoke seem like distant memories. More recently a return of two points since 21 September, against clubs including Burnley, Sunderland, West Brom and Palace, have seen levels of pessimism skyrocket. A lot of the Foxes faithful expected a much heartier fight \u2013 but we can still stay up this season and achieve the minimum expected. The season\u2019s obvious high was that win over Manchester United, while the lows have been virtually every single match that has taken place since. Stars Leonardo Ulloa and Esteban Cambiasso have been our leading men. Ulloa\u2019s goal return of six has been impressive in a challenging season while Cambiasso\u2019s class has shown repeatedly since, outwitting our opponents and, unfortunately, our own team on occasion, too. Flops Most of last season\u2019s stars have failed to make the step up but Ritchie De Laet and Paul Konchesky are the greatest offenders. Perhaps more worryingly, all of last season\u2019s main strikers, Jamie Vardy, David Nugent and Chris Wood, have been comprehensively mediocre. The manager Nigel Pearson is stubborn. It takes him a while to get it right but, when he does, he\u2019s an excellent manager. He\u2019s made a few blunders but I wouldn\u2019t want to be any more critical than that, given his love of colourful language. 6.5/10 Who would play him in a movie? Danny Dyer. No-nonsense, straight-talking, hard-swearing and cheeky. Suits Pearson\u2019s demeanour to a T. Liverpool \u2013 Steph Jones \u2013 Observer reader 5/10 I started this season still feeling low about the last \u2013 sometime around last April I started banging on about how great it was and even if we didn\u2019t win the league, it didn\u2019t matter as we\u2019d had a great time trying. And it\u2019s true, we did. But when it came down to it and we lost, I was gutted. Anyway, even if we were always odds-on to have a hangover from that I certainly wasn\u2019t prepared for quite how hard it is for us now. The only high has been Spurs away, when we looked like scoring every time we went forward. Lows are a few too many already. Stars The supporters, by a mile \u2013 especially those who are driving the campaign to take back the game from the corporates and reduce ticket prices to make it affordable for us all. Their demonstrations and banners on the Kop, and the decision then not to fly flags, was a massive statement. Flops Don\u2019t want to name names. It\u2019s been, from back to front, a collective struggle. The manager It\u2019s a tough one for him with none of his summer signings really showing so far, though of course the signings are not his but the transfer committee buys. Apparently. But whoever sanctioned them, they have not worked out \u2013 and we now desperately need to sign a goalkeeper and a striker in January. And a central midfielder, too. Brendan Rodgers has said that one day he\u2019d like to manage in Spain. He should probably concentrate first on trying to get it right at Anfield, and on limiting the superlatives. 5/10 Who would play him in a movie? Looking beyond the obvious \u2013 David Brent \u2013 I\u2019ll go for Hollywood 70s\u2019 icon George Hamilton. His scripts were occasionally on the woffly side and features wise, he\u2019s spot-on. Manchester City - Lloyd Scragg - @lloyd_scragg 8/10 The early signs were worrying: it looked like we might repeat our limp title defence of 2012-13. But thankfully, things have really picked-up in recent weeks. The intensity and pressing is back, we\u2019ve qualified for the knockout stages of the Champions League and we\u2019ve dealt with those nonsensical \u201cone-man team\u201d jibes. The turning point was undoubtedly the comeback against Bayern, which really does feel like a watershed moment. Stars Sergio Ag\u00fcero was in scintillating form before his injury, pushing himself ever closer to that bracket occupied solely by those two footballers playing in Spain. Continuing the Spanish theme, David Silva, like Ag\u00fcero, was playing brilliantly before his injury, with that goal against West Ham the perfect illustration of his genius. A mention too must go to Joe Hart, who deserves great credit for his consistent form since being dropped in November 2013. Flops If you watch City\u2019s games instead of reading the headlines you\u2019ll know that despite being labelled a flop by many, Eliaquim Mangala has been steadily improving, and has shown exactly why City bought him. He has all the attributes required to be a formidable centre-half. The only real disappointment has been Jovetic continuing to pick up muscle injuries, just when he\u2019s finally beginning to live up to his promise. The manager Pellegrini\u2019s willingness to be tactically flexible has turned our form right round, and all credit to him for that. How he managed the game and the occasion in Rome was particularly impressive. However, how City deal with Barcelona over two legs will prove to be the true litmus test. 8/10 Who would play him in a movie? Al Pacino could channel him. Calm, authoritative and unassuming.
