What else could have prompted his press release entitled: \"Olympic hopefuls - is it in the stars for our athletes?\" And one glance at the analysis of birth dates for the likes of Matthew Pinsent and Steve Backley is enough to chill the blood. We're seriously freaked out, we tell Russell's business manager, Doug Beaumont. This stuff's uncanny. \"Well, it's a very involved science,\" agrees Doug. You're telling us - this bit where Russell divines from the influences of Aries and Sagittarius that Paula Radcliffe is \"determined to succeed\". Doesn't he fear being ducked as a witch? \"Well...\" Just one thing, Doug - there doesn't seem to be a single instance in which he says whether the person will actually win. A pause. Could he stick his neck out? \"We'd, er, need to know the planetary positions of the others in the event.\" And then could you accurately forecast who'd win? \"It depends,\" muses Doug. \"I think that Russell would say somebody in the team is going to win a medal.\" Yes. At some level, you have to admire the work. \u00b7 Meanwhile, the Albuquerque Journal expands on yesterday's news that those who wished to hear Dick Cheney speak in the city last Saturday had to sign a loyalty pledge. The paper has obtained one of the endorsement forms, which reads: \"I (full name) do herby [sic] endorse George Bush for reelection of the United States.\" Well, this looks quite the most legally binding document since Neville Chamberlain's souvenir sheet of A4, and we're awaiting an official response on what happens to those who fib. \u00b7 Surveillance: former Daily Express sports columnist Rob Shepherd, on Sky News, fulminating about the appalling goings-on at the FA. It certainly is behaviour that Shames Us All, and we're pleased to note his electronic tag didn't interfere with the studio equipment. (Rob is fresh out of Highdown after serving half a 14-month sentence for biting a man in the face over a row about a mobile phone. Or was it about his wife's underwear? No, hang on, he'd bitten his wife earlier in the evening, but the second bite was Nokia-related.) Anyway, welcome back to Fleet Street, skipper. \u00b7 A communique arrives from Jane Griffiths, the rebel Reading East MP, so do join us in the traditional chorus of \"What's your point, caller?\". \"NO NO NO\" reads the subject line of her email, which apparently refers to the item she submitted to us concerning the competence of John Redwood's office staff. \"You misunderstand. I would not dream of mocking either my good neighbour John Redwood or any of his staff, who are able and professional in my experience. John is an excellent constituency MP among his other sterling qualities. Love and kisses.\" Right back at you, Jane. \"Love the deliberate mistake in the obituary column today,\" she adds. \"Hope the family saw the funny side too.\" Apologies. We started trying to work out what she's on about six times, but faked stress successfully enough for a doctor to say we don't have to continue. \u00b7 Speaking of being signed off sick, the British Council is still investigating whether its absentee press officer Harry Cummins is in fact Will Cummins, author of some barkingly Islamophobic columns in the Sunday Telegraph. Once again, we suggest Harry invites us down the Strand for more formal discussions on the subject. \u00b7 Calling legal experts. Would we be breaking new ground by suing someone for denying a story? And would we have to issue proceedings against ourselves as publishers of the denials, or could we technically sue the denier for besmirching the Diary's fine reputation? (Although we may have just spotted the flaw in this plan.)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
