Among a range of measures, George Osborne announced a \u00a3314m investment in the A1, bringing the route from London to Newcastle up to motorway standard. There was funding for a link road between the A5 and M1 to cut traffic going through Dunstable, and an upgrade to junction 30 of the M25 to improve access to Lakeside shopping centre. The Department for Transport will pay half the costs of upgrading 2.6 miles of the A30 in Cornwall \u2013 between Temple and Higher Carblake \u2013 from a single to a dual carriageway. It will also provide \u00a342m for cycle lanes and tracks across the UK. Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: \"[Osborne] has announced some significant new money, so to that extent it's welcome.\" But, he said: \"It's nowhere near enough.\" Funds will come from the \u00a35bn pot for infrastructure investment announced on Tuesday, which the Treasury hopes to raise from fresh cuts to Whitehall departments. It will also dip into this for \u00a3120m to build new flood defences. Meanwhile, Osborne named the 12 cities that will share \u00a350m of funding for ultrafast broadband and public Wi-Fi \u2013 announced in this year's budget \u2013 including Brighton and Hove, Coventry, Salford and Aberdeen. The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, was quick to point out that much of the infrastructure spending has yet to materialise. \"A year ago the prime minister boasted about their national infrastructure plan, 12 months on not a single road scheme has even started.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
