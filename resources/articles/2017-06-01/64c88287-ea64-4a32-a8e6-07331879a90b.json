And it hasn\u2019t been praised in the way one might expect of a Neil Jordan series. That\u2019s because, according to the director himself, it isn\u2019t. Riviera, a big-budget drama series that stars Julia Stiles and has set viewing records for Sky Atlantic this month, has Jordan\u2019s name emblazoned all over the credits, but the Irish film-maker behind hits such as Interview with the Vampire and The Crying Game now says the glossy finished product has almost nothing to do with him. \u201cAll I can say is, good luck to them,\u201d Jordan said from Spain, where he is working on a new film. \u201cI can\u2019t claim it\u2019s mine. If I had been in control of the thing it would have been quite different.\u201d Riviera is billed by Sky as \u201can intoxicating thriller set in the sun-drenched south of France, the opulent playground of the world\u2019s filthy rich\u201d, and its publicity promises \u201cmorally ambiguous characters\u201d and \u201caudacious excess\u201d, helping it to become the biggest drama premiere on the channel this year. The box set, released this month, has already been downloaded by 5.3 million viewers. Jordan is listed as the show\u2019s creator and co-writer alongside the Irish novelist John Banville, with executive producer credits going to the former U2 manager Paul McGuinness who initially had the idea for a glitzy drama set on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur. But he believes people have been misled about his involvement. \u201cCritics have said, \u2018Is this the same Neil Jordan that wrote The Crying Game? Is this the same John Banville who won the Booker prize?\u2019 The two episodes we wrote together were reworked by others, after I pulled out,\u201d the director told the Business Post. \u201cI emailed John, wondering whether his doppleganger Benjamin Black had been up to some strange double tricks. His response was that even that scoundrel wouldn\u2019t have written some of that dialogue.\u201d Jordan has no idea who rewrote the episodes. \u201cThey were changed, to my huge surprise and considerable upset. There were various sexual scenes introduced into the story and a lot of very expository dialogue. I objected in the strongest terms possible.\u201d According to Jordan, the project has moved closer to the slick glamour associated with a 1980s soap and away from his plan for a darker drama, exploring how the art market can be used to manipulate high finance. \u201cIt\u2019s being described as Dynasty sur mer,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was quite distressing for John and for myself, the way it proceeded.\u201d When he told Sky Atlantic about his concerns, there was an attempt to address them, but Jordan took \u201ca back seat\u201d from then on. In Riviera Stiles plays the second wife of a billionaire banker who dies in a yacht explosion. The series, available on Sky Atlantic and Now TV, has set a record for new box set downloads. But the reviews have been damning, frequently singling out Jordan and Banville for particular condemnation. \u201cIt is awful,\u201d said Sam Wollaston, television critic for the Guardian. \u201cWhat happened to these great writers?\u201d Jordan co-wrote the two-hour pilot for the series with Banville after McGuinness, who has a home in the south of France, approached him with an idea. It was this pilot which grabbed the attention of Sky Atlantic. \u201cThe first two episodes that myself and John wrote were very dark and complex, and that\u2019s what got everybody attracted to the project in the first place,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cSky Atlantic got involved because of these scripts. But then the producers decided to go in a different direction.\u201d McGuinness collaborated with Liza Marshall and Kris Thykier of Archery Pictures to produce the series. \u201cAm I annoyed with Paul McGuinness? I\u2019m surprised, let me put it that way,\u201d Jordan said. McGuinness\u2019s representatives responded this weekend with a statement: \u201cMaking a show of the scale of Riviera is inevitably a team effort. Neil co-wrote the first two episodes with John Banville. The show is the most successful premiere on Sky Atlantic this year. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of what we have achieved.\u201d Jordan is working on a film starring Isabelle Huppert called The Widow, which will begin shooting in September. He\u2019s looking forward to starting work on the project. \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous relief to know you\u2019ll be in control of every aspect, and you\u2019ll be proud to have your name attached to it,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cIn my mind, there\u2019s no reason why things can\u2019t be both very popular and very good.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
