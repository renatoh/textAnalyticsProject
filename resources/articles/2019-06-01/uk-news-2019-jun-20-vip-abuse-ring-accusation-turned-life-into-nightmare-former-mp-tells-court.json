Giving evidence in the trial of Carl Beech, previously known as \u201cNick\u201d, Proctor said the claims were the \u201cravings of a fantasist\u201d and lies that emanated \u201cfrom a polluted imagination\u201d. Beech, 51, is accused of lying when he claimed he was among victims of an alleged group of establishment figures including senior politicians and military and the intelligence officers who raped, kidnapped and murdered boys in the late 1970s and early 80s. His allegations led to a \u00a32m Scotland Yard inquiry, Operation Midland, and a subsequent raid on Proctor\u2019s home on 4 March 2015. Coming face to face with his accuser in court, Proctor said: \u201cThese were horrendous, horrible, heinous allegations. The worst things that one human being can say against another. It was all untrue.\u201d The 72-year-old became tearful as he described how he had become trapped in a \u201cKafka-esque\u201d nightmare when murder detectives raided his home at Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire. The following morning, he told jurors, his face was plastered across the media. \u201cI looked up at the television screen to see my face looking back at me and a story ran on the head of the BBC news television programme that my property had been searched in connection with historic sexual abuse, including child murders,\u201d he said. Proctor fixed his gaze at jurors while giving evidence, appearing avoid making eye contact with his accuser, who sat impassively in the dock making notes. Proctor told jurors he had requested to be interviewed by detectives at the earliest opportunity to learn more about the allegations and clear his name. He told jurors he lost his job because of \u201cintense\u201d pressure on his employer after a Metropolitan police detective described Beech\u2019s allegations as \u201ccredible and true\u201d. When Beech\u2019s allegations were eventually disclosed to him \u201cin gruesome detail\u201d three and a half months after the police search, \u201cI read it and reread it several times, thinking I have done none of this,\u201d Proctor said. In the media storm, the former MP said he felt \u201cnot entirely safe\u201d so he and his partner decided that they \u201creally ought not to see our future in the UK\u201d. \u201cI do not think there has been a day in the last four years when I\u2019ve not been contacted by the media to discuss the matter or asked a question about the matter,\u201d he said. Tony Badenoch QC, prosecuting, asked for Proctor\u2019s response to Beech\u2019s claim that he tried to cut the defendant\u2019s genitals with a penknife only to be stopped by the former prime minster Edward Heath. Proctor replied: \u201cI have never attempted to cut Mr Beech\u2019s genitals with a knife or anything else, either in a townhouse in central London or a tent in the desert. It\u2019s another absurdity.\u201d Asked about Beech\u2019s claim that Proctor stripped, raped and murdered a boy, he said: \u201cThe allegation is false. It emanates from a polluted imagination. The allegations are horrendous, awful, distasteful. I have nothing to do with them.\u201d Questioned about another murder allegation, Proctor replied: \u201cNot true. I had nothing to do with that. I do not believe that took place. These are more ravings of a fantasist.\u201d Proctor was given the names of a series of high-profile figures Beech has accused, including army chiefs, political figures and the disgraced entertainer Jimmy Savile. Proctor said he had never socialised with any of them. There was laughter in the public gallery when Proctor, asked whether he was friendly with Heath, replied: \u201cIf I met Mr Edward Heath walking down the House of Commons corridor, he would pass me with his nose in the air, disgusted at having to cross my path. The feeling was entirely mutual.\u201d Beech denies 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one of fraud. The trial continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
