Before becoming transport and environment secretary he poured money into the coal industry, propped up the car industry, and attacked rip-off Britain. Now in a weekend raid that \"renationalised\" Railtrack through the back door, he has created outrage - not just in the boardroom, but also among the firm's 250,000 shareholders. Mr Byers is not an easy man to pin down, even if in private he comes across as open, bright, and unstuffy. His detractors claim he is a cypher - too prone to indecision, the patronage of Downing Street, and the vacuity of Blairite rhetoric. His friends claim he is a cool customer under fire, with a sharp strategic brain, capable of spotting the big political issues in his department. In a cabinet short of Blairites, Mr Byers (and his long standing political friend Alan Milburn, the health secretary) has at least stood apart. He has even positioned himself as an outrider for Mr Blair, becoming one of the first ministers to say that the size of the cake mattered more than its precise distribution. Yet Mr Byers faces his roughest moment since the department of trade and industry's failure to spot that BMW was about to get rid of Rover. He stands by Jo Moore, his loyal and capable special adviser, despite her tasteless email on September 11 suggesting the New York attack was a good moment to put out some bad news on councillors' expenses. Downing Street has endured three gruelling days defending Ms Moore, even though everyone in Whitehall thinks the memo represents the worst in New Labour professionalism. Downing Street is standing by Mr Byers's judgment but with a lack of enthusiasm. Elsewhere in the cabinet, it is suggested Mr Byers will have to let her go. Mr Byers is now trying to defend his aide from charges that she tried to force civil service press officers to discredit Bob Kiley, the transport commissioner for London. Mr Byers arrived at the transport department determined to change the political weather over the PPP (public private partnership), the government's plan to part privatise the Tube. He felt his predecessor, John Prescott, swamped by briefs, was losing the propaganda plot. Mr Kiley was monopolising media coverage. With the London Standard openly committed to destruction of the PPP, and minds closed about the arguments, Mr Byers needed desperate measures. He also felt that the mayor, Ken Livingstone, was not averse to playing fast and loose with the facts. However, Mr Byers and Ms Moore lost the confidence of elements in his press office, some of whom, as civil servants, did not like the exacting and sometimes political demands placed on them by Ms Moore. Even worse, Mr Byers is in retreat in the face of the wrath of Railtrack. The Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph, short of New Labour targets over the past three months, smell blood. Railtrack, once the most reviled company in Britain, is recasting itself in the role of victim. Steve Marshall, its chief executive, aided by the shadow chancellor, Michael Howard, is asserting that the private sector and City will never again risk becoming embroiled with public private partnerships, the future lifeblood of local government and hospital building. Mr Byers is determined to withstand the pressure, since his proposal for a non profit-making firm was initially supported by the Liberal Democrats, the Institute of Public Policy Research, and, more important, the Treasury. But chancellor Gordon Brown is no ally and is unlikely to go to the stake to defend him. However, unless Mr Byers confronts the issue of Ms Moore he is likely to lose the more important argument about Railtrack. There is a strong case in defence of his decision and a massive case against Railtrack. But for two days he has refused to appear on TV. For a man normally astute with the media that is a mistake."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
