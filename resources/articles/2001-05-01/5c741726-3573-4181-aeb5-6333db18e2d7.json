Germany's top club said yesterday that the sale of shares to raise money for players and a new stadium was one of several measures being considered in an effort to boost their finances, but added that nothing would be decided until the end of the season. \"An IPO [flotation] is possible in the future but for the moment nothing is planned,\" said the club spokesman, Markus Hoerwick. \"We have to concentrate on sporting matters.\" Bayern, who are only two games away from repeating their German and European double of 1974, are concerned that they do not have the financial firepower to compete with the likes of Manchester United and Milan, who are backed by wealthy benefactors and listed on the stock market. They also need to build a stadium before the 2006 World Cup in Germany. In recent weeks Bayern have been rumoured to be considering a more formal link-up with Adidas-Salomon, their team sponsor of the past 35 years. Adidas has reportedly been considering buying a 10% stake in Bayern but the club denied that an investment was pending, making a flotation more likely. English and Scottish clubs have led the way with stock market flotations but analysts say they have generally made for disappointing investments. Manchester United's dominance in England and the growth of their worldwide merchandising operation have made them the best-performing club share but other British clubs have been less fortunate. Shares in the parent company of Leeds United have barely budged despite the team's strong performance on the pitch, and Aston Villa shares are now worth less than half the price at which they were first sold. Liverpool and Arsenal have considered flotations but are thought to have been put off by the fact that the City would probably not offer the backing they think they deserve. The rise in Adidas shares after Bayern's denial underlined how poorly football clubs are viewed as an investment. \"The only reason Adidas is up is because Bayern have said they are not talking to them about selling a chunk. It is a bit of a relief really,\" said one dealer. Bayern will win their third consecutive league championship if they draw with Hamburg on Saturday. They play Valencia in the Champions League final in Milan next Wednesday. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
