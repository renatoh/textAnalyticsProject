When it boils down to it, his job as Flintoff's agent is to make as much money as he can for his client (and himself) and this indisputably he has done. Fred is rolling in it, a man of means and trappings from the game of a level way beyond any England cricketer before him. And now, in persuading Flintoff that he should break away from the clutches of employment and go it alone, he is after a whole shedload more, enough to fill the swimming pool of a Cheshire mansion. Warm-weather rehab he may be undergoing in Dubai, but here on in, according to Chandler, he will roam the world, a team on every continent: Chennai Super Kings, Nashua Titans, South Australia, an as yet unnamed West Indies team if you can believe it, any time, any place, anywhere. Cricket's Martini man. The money will just roll in. Chubby will expect the bidding war to begin. All this is contingent, of course, on Flintoff ever being in a position actually to play cricket again. His knee is knackered. Reconstructive surgery, while optimistic, is no guarantee that he will regain the fitness to withstand the pounding that a fast bowler of brute strength, with the subtlety of a kick in the nuts, puts it through. Personally I would find it odd if anyone thought it a wise move to throw money towards damaged goods with a relatively modest T20 record before they had seen evidence of fitness. It seems a lot of hype and hypothesising is going on. There is nothing essentially wrong with Flintoff, or any player for that matter, wanting to be his own master. In a way it is a throwback half a century to the days when amateurs played county cricket between board meetings or out of term time, and pulled on their England sweater for nothing. More than a decade after the abolition of the distinction between amateur and professional, I still received a card inviting me to play in a Test match and asking if I was willing to accept a fee. Even professionals ducked out of some of the more arduous tours, generally to the subcontinent. But here is where Chubby does not seem to get the picture. Flintoff has turned down an incremental contract \u2013 which in essence would give him around \u00a350,000 as a top-up to his county salary, by no means inconsequential in his case \u2013 stating that he did not want anyone telling him when to play and when to rest. Those at the England and Wales Cricket Board are genuinely bemused by this, for although a centrally contracted player comes under the primary control of Andy Flower, the team director, no such power is given, beyond suggestion or advice, to one on incremental terms. So beyond a bit of chest-beating, rejecting the contract appears to serve no purpose. As yet there appears to be no conflict of interest either, with the Indian Premier League not clashing with any one-day element in England's touring commitment next winter, and nothing else as yet on the table. So actually, as far as anyone is concerned, Flintoff would be available for all England's fixtures in the foreseeable future once his fitness is established, and, just in case he gets too far ahead of himself, subject to selection. This is where the common ground ends, however. Flintoff is not the centre of the England cricket solar system, with all else revolving around him. He appears to be wanting to dictate the terms on which he will provide his services, but he will find that in Flower there is someone used to dealing with a dictator far more malevolent than either Chandler or Flintoff. It is some while since England regarded an appearance by Flintoff as anything other than a bonus. They do not plan around him and are quite used to life without him. Just as long as there is no conflict, there is no reason to suppose that the two parties, England and Flintoff, cannot coexist harmoniously. But the minute Flintoff attempts to call the shots, deciding not to attend a training camp for example, unilaterally opting out of a turgid series such as that which we are currently enduring, or dictating his fitness to play (remember Chandler's impertinent outburst after Flintoff was deemed unfit for the Headingley Test) is the minute he jettisons his England career. It will not be acceptable to England for him to cherry-pick matches. Beyond simple cricket matters, this is where, surely, he has been badly advised. Flintoff has large endorsement contracts, each of which would be contingent on his profile as an international cricketer. Take away that element and they lose their value. His profile will not come from the IPL where, beyond the subcontinent, viewing figures and general interest, were minuscule, and within India, he is a smaller fish in the pond. Maybe Chandler recognises an asset on his last legs, and is cashing in while he can. In which case good luck to him. It's a bit LA Galaxy lite. The foreign endorsements may stack up like Jenga bricks. But if he loses his England career, then he risks disappearing from view in this country and jeopardising the public's affection and goodwill for him. Would Chandler really put a price on that?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
