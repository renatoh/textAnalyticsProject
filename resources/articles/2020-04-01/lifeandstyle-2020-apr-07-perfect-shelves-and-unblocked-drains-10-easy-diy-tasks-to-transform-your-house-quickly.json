Small problems that may not have bothered you when you spent all day at work \u2013 a wonky curtain, a creaky door \u2013 suddenly demand your attention. But how do you fix things without professional help, armed only with limited tools and even more limited competence? We asked the experts for advice on the 10 simplest DIY tasks you can tackle right now. Basic sewing Si\u00e2n Berry is the co-leader of the Green party, a member of the London Assembly and a candidate in the now-postponed London mayoral election, but she is also the author of Mend It! 400 Easy Repairs for Everyday Items. She thinks the humble sewing needle might be the most important DIY tool you already own. \u201cI totally recommend sewing,\u201d she says. \u201cReplace those buttons, get those hems exactly the right length.\u201d But what if you can\u2019t sew? \u201cHemming is surprisingly easy,\u201d she insists. \u201cThere\u2019s a special stitch for hemming where you\u2019re basically hanging the fabric off very tiny stitches which don\u2019t go through to the outside. It\u2019s a really good skill because you can get all your clothes to fit you perfectly.\u201d Hanging pictures This is a basic skill, requiring only the most basic tools. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a hammer and a nail, it will be enough,\u201d says Jay Blades, a furniture restorer and the presenter of the hit BBC series The Repair Shop. \u201cHammer a nail into the wall, being mindful that there are no wires around. And you should only be going through the plaster. You don\u2019t need to hammer the nail all the way through to your next-door neighbour.\u201d This should be sufficient for smaller pictures, he says, \u201cas long as it\u2019s not a Picasso that weighs quite a lot\u201d. Affixing other things If you want to stick anything heavier to the wall \u2013 a shelf, a towel rail, a Picasso \u2013 you will need a drill, screws and some kind of fixing plug. Jo Behari, one of the authors of Beginner\u2019s Guide to DIY &amp; Home Repair, says you first need to determine what kind of wall you are dealing with \u2013 a stud wall or a solid wall. \u201cStud walls are just partition walls that cut off rooms,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you knock on them they\u2019re really hollow sounding \u2013 they\u2019re made of wood and plasterboard. You don\u2019t want to hang anything really heavy on those.\u201d To put up a flat-screen TV or a big mirror, you need a solid wall made of brick, plus a masonry drill bit. \u201cA masonry bit has a wide spiral and a little arrow at the tip, which is made of tungsten carbide,\u201d she says. A wood bit, preferable for stud walls, has a sharply pointed tip. Once you\u2019ve drilled your hole, tap in a suitable plug with a hammer. Stud walls require butterfly fixings that \u201cpoke through the hole and grab at the back of the wall\u201d. Brick walls take a more bullet-shaped plug. Resealing your bath Behari makes this sound easy. \u201cTo remove the old sealant you just need a Stanley knife,\u201d she says. Slice through the top and bottom edges of the seal at one end. \u201cThen you dig a little bit out and just start to pull, and it will all come out quite nicely.\u201d Remove any extra old sealant with a scraper and clean down with white spirit. \u201cBefore resealing, fill your bath up with water, because then it\u2019s at its heaviest point.\u201d That way the gap between tub and tile is at its widest. If you have never applied sealant with a cartridge gun, Behari recommends practising on a bit of cardboard, until you get the hang of it. \u201cTry to keep a consistent run all round the bathtub. To smooth it off, you can use a bit of washing-up liquid on your finger or water and a teaspoon. It will dry within 24 hours. You can\u2019t wash for that period of time, but, you know, who\u2019s washing these days?\u201d Bookshelves Makeshift shelves can be produced with no tools, from scrap wood. \u201cYou can probably still find random bits of wood on your state-sanctioned walk,\u201d says Berry. \u201cBits of wood and bricks make a lovely, sort-of-temporary bookshelf. At a pinch, you could use books for the uprights.\u201d A dripping tap First: shut off the water. If you do nothing else during lockdown, Behari strongly recommends you locate your stopcock and make sure it is operable. \u201cIt\u2019s normally under the kitchen sink, or in the hallway, or in a cellar.\u201d Another vital tip: put the plug in the sink or the bath before you start, so that if you drop anything small it doesn\u2019t disappear down the drain. A dripping tap probably needs a new rubber washer. More modern taps have ceramic washers, which don\u2019t tend to fail. \u201cTo work out if it is the washer,\u201d says Blades, \u201ctake apart another tap that\u2019s not dripping and swap the washers over.\u201d How do you get at the washer in the first place? \u201cThere will be a way to access the screw that allows you to take apart the tap,\u201d says Behari. \u201cIt might be under the little caps that say hot and cold, they might lever off, or there might be a tiny little hex screw at the back of the tap which you can undo.\u201d Seek out a YouTube demonstration of the repair for your specific type of tap. No matter what, you will need to secure a new washer, but this is not impossible. \u201cYou can actually still get stuff delivered.\u201d says Behari. A pack of washers of mixed sizes can be had for as little as a quid online. Cracks or holes in walls or furniture \u201cIt\u2019s best to fill cracks that are going to move \u2013 doorways, windows, those kind of areas \u2013 with something called caulk,\u201d says Behari. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit more flexible.\u201d Otherwise, ordinary filler \u2013 powdered or pre-mixed \u2013 will do, but if it is a deep crack you need to apply the filler in thin layers, so the stuff at the back gets a chance to dry. For a really big hole in a wall, there is another solution. \u201cThis sounds like a massive bodge, but it\u2019s not,\u201d says Behari. \u201cScrunch up bits of newspaper and fill the hole, so the filler has something to grab on to. And always fill your hole slightly proud of the surface so you can sand away the excess.\u201d If you have got a crack in a wooden surface and nothing to hand, you can make your own filler. \u201cIf you saw a piece of wood, you then create some sawdust,\u201d says Blades. \u201cYou can put that sawdust into the crack, mix it up with some glue on top, and then that will create your kind of wood filler. You can sand it back, you can even stain it, because it\u2019s basically wood shavings with glue.\u201d A blocked drain \u201cReally simple \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t even need any tools,\u201d says Behari. \u201cIt\u2019s just a case of putting bicarbonate of soda down the drain, flushing it through with vinegar. That really clears all the blockages out of your kitchen sink. That\u2019s a really simple thing that people should be doing on a regular basis, but probably aren\u2019t.\u201d If your shower drain is blocked, however, it\u2019s probably hair, according to Blades. \u201cWhat I do is take the drain cover off and pull out whatever\u2019s in there with a metal hanger \u2013 unravel it obviously. Hair being hair, if you twist it around it will latch on to it normally \u2013 nine times out of 10.\u201d A stuck door A door that catches in its frame could have loose hinges, so check that. If the screws are loose and refuse to tighten, Behari and Blades offer the same solution: plugging the screw hole with matchsticks. \u201cStuff as many as you possible can in there,\u201d says Blades, \u201cthen cut them off so the hole is flush, and when you screw your screw back in that will be unbelievably tight.\u201d If the door is still catching against the frame or the carpet below, then you\u2019ve got to check where it makes contact, and mark it with chalk. After that, there is only one solution: \u201c This is good exercise for your triceps,\u201d says Blades. \u201cIt\u2019s rubbing down with coarse sandpaper.\u201d And don\u2019t stop when your sandpaper becomes clogged with dust and you haven\u2019t got any more. \u201cI hoover my sandpaper,\u201d says Blades. \u201cThen it becomes new sandpaper again. I haven\u2019t bought sandpaper in years.\u201d Tackling draughts Repairing or rehanging a draughty door may be beyond the skills of a DIY initiate, but making a patchwork draught excluder isn\u2019t, according to Berry. She favours a dog design (hers is pictured). \u201cYou can do a snake,\u201d she says. \u201cSnakes are easier. But the dog\u2019s face is just one of the nicest things; you just start filling it with old socks or tights, or whatever you\u2019re using, and it gains a personality immediately.\u201d To make the snake excluder, you will need a piece of fabric 40cm wide and 5cm longer than the width of your door. \u201cFold the material over inside-out, sew the long edge together into a tube and close off one end of the tube,\u201d says Berry. \u201cThen turn it inside-out again so the hem is inside and the best side of the fabric is facing out. \u201cUse the leg of an old pair of tights as the inner lining and fill with stuffing. You can use rice, lentils, sand or similar \u2013 just make sure you sew it up tightly, so no bits can escape. Then drop the stuffed tights into your material tube.\u201d After that, you can sew up the mouth end, including a red ribbon for a tongue, and add buttons for eyes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
