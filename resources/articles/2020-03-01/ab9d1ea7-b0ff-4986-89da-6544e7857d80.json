Emergency declarations allow the government to disburse funds, deploy the national guard, repurpose medical facilities and otherwise expedite and mobilize action in response to a specific threat. \u201cIt gives tremendous powers for things that we need,\u201d Trump said in a White House Rose Garden press conference on Friday. \u201cTremendous power actually.\u201d What kind of imminent relief might the declaration indicate? Trump and members of his coronavirus response team made numerous assertions on Friday about help being on the way for the average American. But public confidence in the White House was low. The health secretary said on Monday that 4m tests per week would be available by Friday. Instead, stories proliferated of patients in need of a test who could not access one. Through 12 March, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had completed 4,000 tests \u2013 not 4m. On Friday, Trump said the private sector would only produce 5m tests in the next month, adding: \u201cI doubt we\u2019ll need it.\u201d Testing for coronavirus, including drive-through testing, has been established in many states. Private labs have been working to accelerate test production and many Americans are likely to find tests increasingly available. Asked if he took responsibility for a lack of testing so far, which might have produced a dangerous misunderstanding about the number of current US cases, Trump said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t take responsibility at all.\u201d Here is some of what the administration promised on Friday. Drive-through testing Trump was joined at his press conference by executives from Walmart, CVS and Target, who committed to devoting parking lot acreage to potential testing sites. \u201cVery soon Americans will be able to go to these drive-in sites and be able to join and participate in those tests,\u201d said Vice-President Mike Pence. Ventilators \u2018ordered\u2019 The coronavirus crisis in Italy and elsewhere has culminated in a shortage of breathing assistance devices in medical facilities. Asked about such a potential crunch in the US, Trump said: \u201cWe have ordered a large number of respirators just in case. We hope we don\u2019t need them but we have ordered a large number.\u201d Private labs to process tests Pence said the large private labs LabCorps and Quest had committed to processing tests gathered at mobile sites nationally. The participation of the private labs had been seen as a key to closing the testing gap. \u201cAmericans will be able to visit one of the sites closest to them if the test indicates it \u2026 and one of the incredible companies there will be able to process the tests,\u201d Pence said. Stockpiles for healthcare facilities The emergency declaration will help the government create and distribute needed stockpiles through a network that includes the Veterans Administration, the Department of Defense, the national guard and private hospitals, Dr Birx said, also allowing the government to \u201ckeep those hospital beds open for those who might need it\u201d. \u2018Eight, nine, whatever weeks\u2019 Asked how long the government expects it will take before coronavirus cases peak in the US, Dr Tony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health said \u201ceight, nine, whatever weeks, but I can\u2019t give you a number because it depends on how successful we are\u201d. Birx said the government was taking steps to get through \u201cthat peak of the curve we\u2019re all planning for\u201d. Update: A previous first entry in this story, announcing, as the president did, \u201ca Google site to find where to get tested\u201d, has been deleted. Despite Trump\u2019s announcement of such a service, that service does not appear, with a subsequent statement by the Google-adjacent company in question, to be real. The company Verily, which shares a corporate umbrella with Google, released a statement after Trump\u2019s press conference announcing that it was developing a Covid-19 triage test tool, but the tool \u201c is in the early stages of development\u201d, and the company is \u201cplanning to roll testing out in the Bay Area\u201d, not nationally: \u201cWe are developing a tool to help triage individuals for Covid-19 testing. Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time. We appreciate the support of government officials and industry partners and thank the Google engineers who have volunteered to be part of this effort.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
