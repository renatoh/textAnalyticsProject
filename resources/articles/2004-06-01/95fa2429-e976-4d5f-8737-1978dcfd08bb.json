Jon Dahl Tomasson has been the key figure in taking Morten Olsen's team to the quarter-finals but it was with a quiet performance from him that they departed. On an evening when Tomasson would have loved to have taken centre stage, he was outshone by the Czechs Republic's Milan Baros. Tomasson has lit up successive tournaments, scoring four times at the 2002 World Cup and getting three of Denmark's four goals this time. His subdued display last night surely had much to do with the absence of Ebbe Sand, who is valuable not only for his ability to lead the line but because that allows Tomasson to drift into deeper areas and run matches. It was a shame for Olsen that Sand was injured.With no obvious replacement, Tomasson was pushed further forward and Charlton's Claus Jensen was brought in to play behind him. Tomasson struggled to have his usual impact; his sorcery was missed. Though some of his off- the-ball runs were clever as he tried to get away from his markers, those were not always spotted by his team-mates and the need for him to lead the line meant he found it hard to find room in which to dictate play. His lay-offs can be vital to getting Denmark's wingers into their stride. If the Czechs helped stifle the counter-attacking threat on the flanks by keeping their full-backs in defensive positions, the difficulty Tomasson had in escaping the central defenders was also a factor in the Danes struggle to get the best out of Martin Jorgensen and Jesper Gronkjaer. Tomasson was involved in Denmark's best first-half move. Spinning away from Rene Bolf, he clipped a pass wide for a break that culminated in Christian Poulsen seeing a shot blocked. But with him largely quiet, Denmark could have done with their wide players causing problems. Yet Jorgensen had virtually no impact apart from a brief spell shortly after the interval and Gronkjaer produced little, spoiling moments of good work with poor end product. Though Jorgensen provided a cross that Tomasson was just beaten to with the score 1-0, soon the contest was over as Baros scored twice. Princess and \"king\" of Denmark will have been united in disappointment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
