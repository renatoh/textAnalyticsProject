He insisted he was in good enough shape to fight the general election despite being on Temazepam sleeping tablets and receiving hospital treatment twice a week for the recurrence of serious back pain. Just weeks ago at Ukip\u2019s spring conference, he denied rumours that he was unwell, claiming to be as \u201cfit as a flea\u201d and accusing his political rivals of spreading untruths about his wellbeing. In his recent autobiographical book, Purple Revolution, he revealed that several health scares including testicular cancer, a car accident and a light aircraft crash had left him with the body of a 70-year-old. He has now told the Daily Telegraph: \u201cI was not unwell \u2013 I have not had heart palpitations - but I was getting increasingly terrible pain in my shoulder, my back and so I was suffering from neuralgic pain. \u201cI was not ill but I was in a lot of pain and neuralgic pain is horrible. It is nerves. I would move my arm and it would go. I was really having a bad time.\u201d Earlier this week, Farage acknowledged he had tried to do too much at the beginning of the election contest. \u201cI started the campaign and think I made some mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cMy desperation for Ukip to do well meant that I really packed the diary and the day in a way that frankly wasn\u2019t very bright. I have now trimmed it back a bit. I\u2019m being a bit more selective.\u201d Asked whether he had got a bit \u201cwonky\u201d at one point, Farage said: \u201cI was. No, no. Hands up I was. I had completely overdone it. I wasn\u2019t getting it right. I feel a bit of the old vim and vigour back and I\u2019m looking forward to the next fortnight.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
