To mark her 90th birthday, it is in the latter role that the celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz has captured Britain\u2019s first nonagenarian monarch, surrounded by her five great-grandchildren and two youngest grandchildren. In a highly stylised portrait, released by Buckingham Palace, it is the woman who is celebrated, rather than the sovereign. With Princess Charlotte, the 11-month-old daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on her lap, the Queen is flanked by Prince George, and Zara Phillip\u2019s daughter Mia, both two, Peter Phillips\u2019s daughters Savannah, five, and Isla, three, and the Earl and Countess of Wessex\u2019s children, James, Viscount Severn, eight, and Lady Louise Windsor, 12. The last time the Queen was photographed by Leibovitz, \u201cCrowngate\u201d exploded, when a trailer for a BBC documentary featuring behind-the-scenes footage of the shoot was edited in such a way as to erroneously suggest the Queen had stormed off in a huff. Two other official pictures are released today, one showing the Queen on the stone terrace of Windsor Castle with her four dogs, corgis Willow and Holly, and dorgis Vulcan and Candy, and another of her sitting with her only daughter, the Princess Royal. On the eve of her birthday, the Queen was in Windsor to mark a significant milestone in the history of another British institution. Five hundred years after Henry VIII knighted the first master of the posts, leading to the creation of the Royal Mail as we know it, she visited her local Windsor postal department which was being renamed in her honour. On being told the Royal Mail delivers over a billion parcels a year, the Queen drily noted: \u201cI\u2019ve probably added to that this week.\u201d Moya Greene, Royal Mail chief executive, joked: \u201cI have it on good authority that your own postmen and women will be especially busy with tomorrow\u2019s mailbag.\u201d Thursday\u2019s celebrations are planned to be relatively low key. After a walkabout on her Windsor doorstep, she will later light the first of a chain of more than 1,000 beacons across the UK and overseas before attending a birthday dinner hosted by Prince Charles and attended by members of her family. Being the Queen she is blessed with two birthdays each year, one actual and one official. More formal celebrations, including a service of thanksgiving at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral and giant street party in the Mall, are planned for her official birthday in June. The Duke of Cambridge, Prince William, paid tribute to his grandmother in TV interviews and spoke of the support she has given him as he described his own sense of destiny and duty. Of the recent \u201cworkshy\u201d jibes, he said he was \u201cgoing to get plenty of criticism over my lifetime, and it\u2019s something that I don\u2019t completely ignore, but it\u2019s not something I take completely to heart\u201d. \u201cWhen the Queen decides that she\u2019s going to hand down more responsibilities, I\u2019ll be the first person to accept them,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cI take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it\u2019s about finding your own way at the right time, and if you\u2019re not careful duty can weigh you down at a very early age.\u201d His grandmother and father were both very active and engaged, and his family was \u201cextremely supportive\u201d of him not carrying out more royal engagements and having \u201ctime and space to explore another means of doing a worthwhile job,\u201d he said. Thoughts on what kind of king he wanted to be \u201cvery much occupies my thinking space\u201d, he said. But it was not a priority at present. It could be twenty or more years hence, he said. \u201cI have no idea when that\u2019s going to be, and I certainly don\u2019t lie awake waiting or hoping for it, because it sadly means that my family have moved on, and I don\u2019t want that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
