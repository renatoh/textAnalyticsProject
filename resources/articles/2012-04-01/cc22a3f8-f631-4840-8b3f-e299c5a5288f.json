Anyone bent on dismissing him will walk into his Tate Modern retrospective and find their ammunition. There are endless chemists' cupboards. There are the spots he outsources to other painters, and which \u2013 in terms of craftsmanship at least \u2013 make for an unflattering contrast with David Hockney and Lucian Freud, whose work is being exhibited elsewhere in the capital. And there is the pervasive sense of a joke being played on the crowd, a sense that has developed ever since the young Hirst said he wanted to get to the point where he could get away with bad art. But glance into that crowd and it suddenly seems like folly to damn Damien too quickly. All around, people are looking \u2013 really looking \u2013 at objects in new ways, an important aim for any artist. Take the bisected cow and calf, Mother and Child Divided. You've seen many a cow and have also, perhaps, seen their organs in a biology book. But have your eyes ever darted between any animal's inner and outer body in quite this way before? Likewise the (in)famous pickled shark, which can look like a half-funny gag when seen on television, but which stirs into undead life when its gaping mouth is encountered up close and personal. Nor is it all about empty appearances. There are also ideas at work in Hirst's art. The deeper question, though, is whether these ideas are anything but pernicious. The installation which hoisted Hirst into the big time, after Charles Saatchi snapped it up, involves specially bred insects being frustrated and killed in pursuance of the hideous object of their desire, a severed bovine head. The title, A Thousand Years, confirms the message of the grisly spectacle \u2013 \"As flies to wanton boys are we to th' gods\". Whereas in Shakespeare this is a chilling thought, Hirst revels in callous omnipotence. Throw in the bling obsession with gilded artifice, and this seems like a man whose defining mission is negating the Keatsian dictum about beauty and truth. For those who cling to John Ruskin's ideal of an artist with \"the responsibility of a preacher\", Hirst is an affront. His ruthless defence of his own intellectual property combines with career-long allegations of plagiarism from less well-rewarded peers. But sometimes, as with the jewel-laced skull, Hirst's limitless lucre is the precondition to pulling off the idea. That is a fitting irony for a paradoxical man who insists that every work must \"say something and deny it at the same time\". A more self-confident era might expect its artists to say something solid instead, but Hirst's preoccupations \u2013 purposeless, plutocratic, even pharmaceutical \u2013 are the preoccupations of our age. He is, perhaps, the artist we deserve."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
