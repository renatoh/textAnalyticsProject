This semi-efficient, Belgian-set timewaster fuses Taken with Unknown, and almost works: Aaron Eckhart is typically brisk as a security expert forced on the run after being declared persona non grata. Set against Taken's Maggie Grace, Liana Liberato (Trust) is practically a Rhodes scholar in the delinquent daughter role. Sadly, the script remains reconstituted pulp, prompting familiar foot chases through metro stations, and Olga Kurylenko scarcely convinces as a CIA chief. It doesn't entirely insult the intelligence, but often leans towards the indifferent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
