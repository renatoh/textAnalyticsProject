In an address due to be given at the Lowy Institute on Tuesday, he also criticises Australia\u2019s bid to be on the UN human rights council, asking how the country can provide any leadership when \u201cour own house is not in order\u201d. If Australia wanted to be a \u201cconfident and courageous country\u201d it must start developing its own foreign policy, independent of the United States, his speech says. And Australia\u2019s foreign aid should be increased to a minimum of 0.7% of gross national income by 2025, because the \u201cbest investment\u201d in national security was to alleviate poverty in the region. Di Natale\u2019s speech \u2013 who has been Greens leader for just over a year \u2013 says Australia is in the middle of \u201can unprecedented retreat\u201d under the Turnbull government. Commitments on human rights, asylum seekers, foreign aid, global warming and clean energy investment have all gone backwards in recent years, he says. He says the Greens are the only party that understands the threat to national security from global warming, while also recognising that Australia can harness its vast reserves of renewable energy for great opportunity. Last week senior Labor figures accused the Greens of making a preference deal with the Liberals after the Victorian Liberal president, Michael Kroger, indicated his willingness to preference the Greens over Labor. Labor\u2019s Anthony Albanese, who is being challenged in his Sydney seat of Grayndler by the Greens, accused them of agreeing to issue \u201copen tickets\u201d without any preference recommendations in numerous marginal seats, mostly in Victoria, in exchange for the Liberal party preferencing the Greens ahead of Labor in some inner-city seats in Melbourne and Sydney. Di Natale ignores the row in his Lowy Institute speech, saying only that he would work with \u201cwhoever is in government\u201d to reap the potential that Australia\u2019s energy exports and technology transfer programs held for the new economy. \u201cWe need a government that understands our collective economic future is clean and green, or it is no future at all,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are great opportunities for an Australia that capitalises on this vision \u2013 as one of the sunniest and windiest countries in the world, Australia can lead the transition to a clean energy powered future. The Greens are calling for global diplomatic efforts towards an international agreement on how to respond to people displaced by global warming, he says. He suggests Australia should start issuing a special form of humanitarian visa for such people. \u201cNo matter what strategy is deployed, given the slow pace of global negotiations set against our rapidly changing weather systems, the Greens would like to see plans put in place for this process and planning to commence now \u2013 there is no time to waste,\u201d he says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
