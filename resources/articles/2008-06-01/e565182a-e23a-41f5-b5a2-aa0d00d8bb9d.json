I want, in auntly fashion, to praise Michelle de Kretser for being good and beautiful, while scolding her for being afraid to show her goodness and beauty. What do you want to hide behind all that face-paint for, child? Do you think you have to be as skinny as a pencil and wear a ring in your navel just because other people do? The fashionable disfigurements and artificialities I complain of are, of course, literary, and they affect not her, but her novel, The Lost Dog Kretser's native style is clear, vigorous, sensitive to mood and cadence, and strongly narrative - an excellent tool for a novelist with a story to tell. She does have a story to tell, and a good one; complex, though not as intricate as the devious, multitemporal telling of it makes it seem. A mystery is involved; there are a great many echoes and doublings and ghostings; perhaps more than one lost dog. That's fine. But the echoes are rather hammered home; the semi-ghosts give off a whiff of Jamesian mothballs. Far more trenchant are the recent-historical elements of her book and its locales in India and Australia, described with persuasive vitality and an ethical alertness that gives keen observation relevance and wit. \"The scent of India, excrement and spices, billowed through the house. On a radio somewhere close at hand, a crooner was singing 'Whispering Hope'. A ziggurat of green oranges slid past, inches from the barred window . . . Eileen brought out a heavy album with brass studs along the spine. From its matt black pages de Souzas gazed out unsmiling, each new generation less plausibly European.\" Eileen's sister Iris, once a beautiful north Indian girl pale enough to marry an Englishman, is now a pitiful hulk of 82 exiled to Australia and exposed to every indignity of old age. Her son Tom, half-English though darker-skinned than she, is the viewpoint character of the novel (except for a few pointless, random dips into other minds). Tom is to some extent lost, not altogether unhappily, in Australia; and it is Tom's dog who gets lost in the Australian bush. The dog evidently has a name, because Tom calls it, but what he calls it we are not allowed to hear. It is this kind of self-conscious doling and withholding of information, these mincing power-games of author against reader, that made me begin to mutter \"Booker tricks!\" under my breath. And the prose sometimes yields to the kind of overwriting that blurbers adore: \"It was a substitution he literalised. In one of the regular sessions he devoted to Nelly, he lay in a darkened room, gazing by the unsteady light of a tea candle at a photocopied page. When he had finished, the edifice of her imaginings was tagged with his luminous urgency.\" Nelly Zhang is an artist who allows only photographs of her work to be shown, having (perhaps) destroyed the originals; she enjoys the success that that kind of gimmicky pretentiousness might indeed bring. The works described are mostly the found-objects-displayed-in-little-boxes type of thing. Tom finds them immensely moving, but then Tom has a crush on Nelly. The reader is likely to find her more interesting than her artworks. For de Kretser's displaced and subtle characters are genuinely interesting, and her writing is emotionally accurate when it isn't holding trendy poses. Such posturing is probably, and understandably, camouflage. A young author, particularly a woman, who refuses the artificiality and ironic distancing expected of successful novels in the current modernist style can be excused for disguising subversion with the very manner she is subverting. For instance, since it will automatically be damned as sentimentality, any emotion concerning animals has to be handled with tongs. Tom suffers a great deal when his dog goes missing, but we must realise his suffering almost without being told about it; he himself is quite unable to talk about it. Still, he realises at last that \"what he risked in showing empathy was to appear unironic. Irony was the trope of mastery: of seeing through, of knowing better . . . To be modern was to be ironic. Among the things he was ashamed of was seeming out of date.\" De Kretser is taking the same risk, facing the same shame, in refusing this modernist mastery. A novelist who uses a lonely man's affection for a dog as a major element of her story, whose empathy is intense enough that she can write of an old woman that fear was her \"mechanism for allotting herself time . . . Fear was her best hope\" - such a novelist courts the patronising dismissal of the realists who, in accordance with TS Eliot, cannot bear very much reality. In her valour, however, lies the virtue of her book, a fine novel, containing in it the promise of even better and more beautiful, less self-conscious works to come. \u00b7 Ursula K Le Guin's novel Lavinia will be published next year.
