I am happy to be in the fifth round.\u201d The Shrewsbury manager, Sam Ricketts, was unhappy with what he described as a foul when Cavaleiro shoved a defender out of the way en route to goal, although the referee ran it past VAR and allowed it to stand. \u201cI couldn\u2019t ask any more of my players, coming back from that early goal to take the lead,\u201d Ricketts said. \u201cClearly we missed our best chance at our own ground but I\u2019m still proud to come here and push Wolves hard.\u201d As if determined not to repeat the mistakes of the first game , Wolves took the lead as early as possible, scoring in the second minute with their first attack of the game. Ryan Haynes conceded a corner that was only half cleared, Morgan Gibbs-White swung over a second cross from the right, and when the ball dropped on the six-yard line Doherty was quickest to react to stab a low shot over the line. If that was daunting for the visitors it did not show. Shrewsbury won their first corner in the 11th minute, Oliver Norburn delivered an inswinger and James Bolton took advantage of some hesitant defending to get his head to it first. Wolves created the next opening with a trademark Adama Traor\u00e9 run and cross down the right, and Jonny Otto must have thought he had scored with a firmly struck first-time shot, only to see his attempt blocked on the line. The home side were doing most of the pressing by the half-hour stage and Willy Boly should probably have scored with a free header from a corner except that by the time Gibbs-White\u2019s cross reached him he was almost on his knees and facing away from goal. All of which made it more of a surprise when Shrewsbury scored a goal from nothing, completely against the run of play, to get their noses in front just before the interval. The game had stopped for a while as Romain Vincelot limped off with a hamstring injury and when it restarted Wolves appeared to be caught cold. Josh Laurent was given enough space to try a speculative shot from outside the area, and though John Ruddy appeared to have it covered he let the ball slip through his grasp to trickle over the line. Fortunately Doherty managed to spare his goalkeeper\u2019s blushes with an equaliser late in the hefty six minutes of first-half stoppage time added for injuries to Vincelot and Ryan Bennett, stooping to head in an Otto cross from the left. Despite Shrewsbury showing more resistance than Everton managed last weekend, Nuno resisted the temptation to send on some of his big names for the second half. His confidence was rewarded by a succession of early corners, almost all of which Gibbs-White put too close to Steve Arnold, and then by an excellent goal from open play just past the hour. The lively Traor\u00e9 picked Omar Beckles\u2019 pocket on the right, then Doherty\u2019s ball into the area was maximised by a surging run from Cavaleiro, who used his strength and control to hold off two defenders before slotting the ball home from the six yard line. \u201cYou\u2019re not singing any more,\u201d the home crowd were cheeky enough to chant. Wolves sent for Jo\u00e3o Moutinho then Ra\u00fal Jimenez after that, but though the latter brought a fine save from Arnold the score remained unchanged. Beckles almost earned extra time with a shot that grazed an upright, but Shrewsbury had to be content with four goals in two games against opponents two divisions higher. It is more than some Premier League teams will manage this season.
