The sculptor David Williams-Ellis has created the centrepiece for the new British Normandy Memorial, in Ver-sur-Mer, France: a trio of soldiers surging forward on a triangular granite plinth. With its balletic grace and lack of triumphalism, it marks the great turning point of the war and represents the changing face of war memorials in recent years. Until April, the site on which Williams-Ellis\u2019s sculpture stands was just a green field on a small hill overlooking a beach. It is, of course, not just any beach, but Gold beach, the middle one of five codenamed by the allies for Operation Neptune, the opening salvo in the liberation of France. North-west of the site are the hulking concrete remains of the allies\u2019 temporary Mulberry B harbour. This is where a piper will play on Thursday at 7.26am \u2013 the exact moment the first man landed, three-quarters of a century ago. In recent years, the number of war memorials in the UK has rapidly increased: according to the Imperial War Museums\u2019 national register there are now more than 80,000 of them. And yet, of all the countries that took part in the allied invasion in 1945, Britain has been the only one not to have a dedicated memorial where forces landed in France. It is something Williams-Ellis has helped rectify. In his Oxfordshire studio, the artist shows me the original sculptures he worked on, using leftover armature of one towering, full-size figure and a digitally rendered 3D scan of the finished piece in miniature. When we meet, the bronze is in a foundry in Basingstoke, from where it will be picked up and put on the back of a low-loader and taken by ferry to France. The piece has taken months of all-consuming focus and heavy lifting, not to mention trips to several sites in France and sessions with veterans and their children who are still grieving 75 years on. Seeing it finally in place will no doubt come as a relief. Williams-Ellis worked with an ex-footballer and a ballet dancer in order to model his statues from life: \u201cI wanted to have leadership and comradeship, but nothing too obvious,\u201d he says. The soldiers\u2019 kit (entrenching spades, gas masks, water bottles, a mug) and weaponry (a .303 rifle, a Bren machine gun and a Sten gun) are rendered with detail but not hyperrealism. He knows his way around the human head, but these faces really pushed him: \u201cI took the head of one of them off twice, it just looked awful.\u201d Unusually for a commemorative tableau, the figures rise from the base in distinctly limber silhouettes, because, as William-Ellis puts it, \u201cif you were hanging around, you weren\u2019t going to survive\u201d. By 2020, the sculpture will stand in front of architect Liam O\u2019Connor\u2019s neoclassical memorial \u2013 a walled forecourt with colonnades and gardens on either side. To be inscribed on the 160 columns will be the names of 22,442 servicemen and women who died here. Richard Kindersley and Robbie Smith have spent months creating a typeface with which to record the deceased. The roll of honour specifies rank and age: the youngest soldier Smith has come across so far was 16. \u201cThat\u2019s quite shocking,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were kids.\u201d Kindersley thinks about how they all had parents, siblings, friends: \u201cThe amount of sadness and distress aggregated must have been calamitous.\u201d Frances Moreton, director of the War Memorials Trust, points out that the vast majority of last century\u2019s memorials are not memorials but proxy graves for mourners to grieve those buried too far away or never buried at all. But the Normandy memorial represents the beginning of a shift away from living memory and into a collective commemoration of the conflict as a whole. Victorian memorials often focused on military leaders \u2013 for example, the Henry Havelock and James Napier statues that bracket Nelson\u2019s Column in Trafalgar Square \u2013 and that tradition has continued, with field marshals, majors and generals set in bronze until as recently as the 1990s. But recent efforts have seen a shift. The Normandy memorial, much like the 2007 Armed Forces Memorial in Staffordshire, the 2014 Korean War Memorial in London and the 2017 Iraq and Afghanistan Memorial, also in the capital, all focus instead on ordinary soldiers and civilian losses. Beyond that, there are modern monuments that acknowledge the complexity of what they represent (millions of lives lost or names unknown) which have used more abstract or symbolic forms. These include the bronze maple leaves floating downstream on Green Park\u2019s Canada Memorial and the rack of hats and jackets for the Women of World War II on Whitehall. From an aesthetic and conceptual point of view, the Normandy memorial is extremely conservative, its design far removed from what one would expect of contemporary work. This is an indirect result of the process: war memorials, by and large, are privately funded and created. There is no public call for submissions, no curatorial committee, no wider art-world input. This means that, contrary to, say, the exciting sense of possibility each new Fourth Plinth commission brings to the public \u2013 Michael Rakowitz\u2019s astonishing tin-can winged bull; Elmgreen and Dragset\u2019s playful rocking-horse boy \u2013 memorial statues exist in a cultural vacuum. Williams-Ellis was chosen by the architect O\u2019Connor who was picked by the Normandy Memorial Trust. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing they\u2019re not trying anything controversial or radical,\u201d says the historian Antony Beevor, noting how this memorial fits with tradition. Essentially, it\u2019s a monument for generations past. So what is it like creating a commemorative sculpture in the context of current controversy surrounding historical statues \u2013 such as Cecil Rhodes in Oxford and Robert E Lee in Charlottesville? Only time will tell, but Williams-Ellis feels that in another 70 years, we will still think people died on D-day doing something they felt was right. And, contrary to the 2012 Bomber Command Memorial, there is no question in the UK over whether the 22,442 should be memorialised. In France, feelings have been more mixed. Beevor highlights the considerable losses the Calvados region incurred at the hands of the allies. O\u2019Connor\u2019s neoclassical monument will include a large French memorial recording that nearly as many French civilians \u2013 about 20,000 \u2013 were killed and many more wounded. Compared to the almost tokenistic catch-all dedication on the Bomber Command pavilion \u2013 \u201cto those of all nations who lost their lives in the bombing of 1939-45\u201d \u2013 this, at least, has the benefit of greater precision. One of the most powerful aspects of last year\u2019s first world war centenary events was the attempt to fill the gaps in how that history has been told \u2013 the African porters whose names and numbers went unrecorded; the unheard stories of Caribbean servicemen. Here, all three figures are white and male. Had this been in Italy or the far east, Beevor says, the demographics would have been different. Here, though, any ethnically diverse portrayal would have raised eyebrows, because only a very small percentage of the people involved were not white men. The trust\u2019s website notes that only two were women. \u201cThere was an expectation to be truthful,\u201d says Williams-Ellis. He talks of the many boxes his sculpture needed to tick \u2013 symbolism, accuracy, relatability. Mixed reactions to recent memorials show that, if anything, a memorial in 2019 should allow for complexity and national humility, too. Despite the profusion of new memorials, Luytens\u2019 minimalistic Cenotaph still turns heads for its profound simplicity, its few words. What seems undeniable is that this Normandy memorial could not be more relevant now. The irony, as Beevor puts it, is that at a time when we\u2019re doing almost everything to undermine international cooperation by leaving Europe, here is a monument to one of the greatest examples of international cooperation \u2013 to liberate western Europe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
