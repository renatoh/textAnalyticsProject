How will they affect you? The childcare package This will introduce a single means-tested subsidy for families to replace the existing rebate and benefit. The single subsidy will cover up to 85% of the costs of childcare for some households, depending on their income. Lowest income households will receive the highest benefit. The subsidy will be paid directly to service providers. The size of the subsidy will be determined by an \u201cactivity test\u201d that considers the amount of work, training, study, or other recognised activity done by parents. The entry point for the activity test will be four hours a week, and those four hours will result in parents being eligible for 18 hours of subsidised child care. Families can claim a maximum 50 hours a week of subsidised care. The government says the package will stop childcare fees increasing \u201cincessantly\u201d because it is capping the hourly fee rate that childcare providers can charge, indexed to inflation. Is there a safety net? Yes. Some families who don\u2019t meet the activity test will be able to access a new \u201cchildcare safety net.\u201d It means families earning $65,710 or less who fail the activity test will still be able to access 12 hours of subsidised child care per week \u2013 at the highest 85% rate of subsidy. That is half the hours they receive under the current system. The government says families who fail the activity test could have access to more hours of subsidised care \u201csimply by undertaking recognised activity for as little as four hours a week.\u201d How will the childcare changes affect families? The government has abolished the annual cap on the amount of subsidy that families can claim for any household earning up to $185,000 a year. For families earning more than $185,000, the cap has been lifted from the pre-existing $7,500 a year to $10,000. The lowest income households will receive the highest subsidy rate. Families earning $65,710 or less, who meet the activity test, will be able to access the maximum subsidy rate of 85% of their child care fees, up from their current rate of 72%. For families earning between $65,710 and $170,710, the subsidy rate will decrease progressively from 85% to 50% (by 1 percentage point for each $3000 of family income). For families earning between $170,710 and $250,000, the rate will be 50% of childcare fees. For families earning between $250,000 and $340,000, the subsidy rate will decrease progressively from 50% to 20% of childcare fees (and it will stay at 20% for households earning between $340,000 and $350,000). To secure the vote in the Senate, the Turnbull government agreed not to subsidise families earning over $350,000 a year. What does it look like financially? The government has provided detailed cameos for various family types showing how the childcare changes will make families better off. A family on $50,000 per year: Single parent working Two children aged under 6 in long day care three days a week at $100 a day Family will be $3,295 better off a year A family on $80,000 per year: Both parents working Two children aged under 6 in long day care three days a week at $100 a day Family will be $3,424 better off a year A family on $150,000 per year: Both parents working Two children aged under 6 in long day care three days a week at $100 a day Family will be $1,626 better off a year However, the government has not provided detailed cameos to show what types of families will be worse off. It says there will be 52,100 families, earning less than $65,710, that will get a reduced subsidy due to the activity test. For low- to middle-income families, earning between $65,710 and $170,710, it says there will be 565,400 families better off, while 32,800 will experience no change. For upper income families, earning between $170,710 to $250,000, it says there will be 142,400 families better off, while 19,500 will experience no change, and 16,600 will get a reduced subsidy. For high-income families earning more than $250,000, it says 3,800 families will be better off, while 7,200 families will experience no change, and 59,500 families will get a reduced subsidy. Welfare package To offset the costs of the childcare package, the government secured a revised savings package in the Senate worth $2.4bn. It imposes an indexation freeze for two years in the base rate and maximum payment rates for family payments, saving the budget $2bn between now and 2020-21. The shadow minister for social services, Jenny Macklin, accused the government of reviving an Abbott-era budget cut with the indexation freeze. She said freezing the indexation of family tax benefit rates would mean 1.5 million Australian families would be worse off. The government has not provided cameos showing what impact the two-year freeze will have on family budgets."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
