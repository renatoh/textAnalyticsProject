An independent review last year urged the government to tighten up its regime to record contact with so called \u201cin house\u201d and industry lobbyists, amid concerns by successive integrity commissioners that attempts to sway decisions were flying under the radar. But the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has revealed her government rejects the idea, in line with a parliamentary inquiry that found \u201ccurrent lobbying regulations achieve the intent of ensuring transparency regarding parties seeking to influence government officials\u201d. Palaszczuk on Friday tabled parliamentary papers showing the government agreed with the parliamentary finance and administrative committee that the \u201ccurrent definition of lobbyists\u201d not be expanded. Currently, only professional lobbyists are required to be on a lobbyist register and record their contact with politicians and bureaucrats \u2013 while company executives, lawyers and lobby groups like the Queensland Resources Council and the Property Council are not. The government\u2019s stance puts it at odds with the state integrity commissioner, Richard Bingham, who told the committee that extending the scope of the lobby laws, as New South Wales did in 2014, would capture \u201ca larger proportion of the lobbying actually occurring\u201d. Bingham said he supported this despite expecting that \u201cany expansion of the lobbying regime will be opposed by some stakeholders\u201d. It follows a chorus for reform in Queensland in recent years from corruption fighters such as former judge Tony Fitzgerald and onetime New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption head David Ipp. Bingham\u2019s predecessor David Solomon has called for the change since 2009. Mark Ogge, a researcher with thinktank the Australia Institute, said the government\u2019s refusal to lift the veil on such lobbying was \u201can outrage\u201d. \u201cYou can drive a truck through Queensland\u2019s lobbying laws,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment, the CEO of a mining company can meet with the director general of the State Development Department and there\u2019s no record of it whatsoever. \u201cWhen you\u2019re making decisions about allowing essentially the exploitation of state assets worth potentially billions of dollars, to have that degree of secrecy around those decisions is ultimately a recipe for corruption. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly disappointing that Queensland\u2019s parliamentarians, when presented with a perfect opportunity to clean up this kind of behaviour, are failing to act.\u201d Bingham in his annual report last year said that \u201cthe benefits of the current lobbying regime in Queensland may be perceived as limited\u201d. \u201cThe regime has effectively reduced the extent of lobbying undertaken by registered lobbyists, but it does not capture a significant percentage of the lobbying activity undertaken by others who are not required to be registered,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies and individuals seeking to influence government can avoid the need for transparency inherent in the lobbyist register by undertaking their contact with government in different ways, for example by using parties who fall within an exemption (such as their own employees, industry groups or lawyers). Ogge said professional lobbyists who did have to disclose their contacts with officials often \u201cpave the way\u201d for in-house lobbyists to follow up undetected. Those contacts may show up in \u201cscant detail\u201d in ministerial diaries but nowhere else, especially with senior bureacrats, he said. \u201cAt the moment mining companies and others have a direct line to the government, nobody knows what they say or the pressure they bring to bear,\u201d Ogge said. \u201cSome of these kinds of deals are the largest transfer of public wealth to private hands that the government can make, often worth billions of dollars. \u201cThese government representatives are meant to be acting in the interests of Queensland to get the best deal possible and protect people from the negative impacts of these projects. \u201cIf they\u2019re meeting in secret, and as we\u2019ve seen, senior bureaucrats have cosy relationships with mining lobbyists, then there\u2019s a massive risk of misconduct or even corrupt behaviour.\u201d The 2015 strategic review by Queensland university of technology vice-chancellor Peter Coaldrake, recommended the registration of lobbyists be widened and that the integrity commissioner \u201ccollect and report statistics in relation to in-house lobbyist activities\u201d. Solomon in his final annual report in 2014 also called for stronger regulation of those lobbyists. He wrote to the then premier Campbell Newman in 2014 saying he had been \u201cconcerned for some time \u2026 about the general issue of nepotism and patronage\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
