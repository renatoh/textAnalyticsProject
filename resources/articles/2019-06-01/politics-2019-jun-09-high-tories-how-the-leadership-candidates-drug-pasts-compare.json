From cannabis yogurt drinks to opium at weddings, here are their confessions. Boris Johnson Appearing on Have I Got News For You in 2005, Johnson said: \u201cI think I was once given cocaine, but I sneezed and so it did not go up my nose. In fact, I may have been doing icing sugar.\u201d However, in a GQ interview in 2007, the Tory leadership frontrunner admitted to trying cocaine and cannabis at university, saying it \u201cachieved no pharmacological, psychotropic or any other effect on me whatsoever\u201d. Jeremy Hunt The foreign secretary told the Times: \u201cI think I had a cannabis lassi when I went backpacking through India\u201d. He added: \u201cThat is almost as naughty as wheat fields,\u201d referring to Theresa May\u2019s widely ridiculed answer when she was asked about the naughtiest thing she\u2019s ever done. Andrea Leadsom Responding to the revelations of Gove\u2019s drug-taking, Leadsom said she had smoked cannabis at university, but had never done it since. \u201cI have never taken cocaine or class A drugs,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cEveryone is entitled to a private life before becoming an MP.\u201d Dominic Raab Raab, who had already admitted taking cannabis as a student, said: \u201cAt university, I tried cannabis, not very often as I was into sport. It was a mistake, particularly the more I know now about the link between it and mental health issues. \u201cBut it was a long time ago and was particularly few and far between and I have never taken cocaine or any class A drugs.\u201d Sajid Javid Javid said he had never taken \u201cany soft or hard drugs\u201d. He told Sky: \u201cAnyone that takes class A drugs needs to think about that supply chain that comes, let\u2019s say, from Colombia to Chelsea, and the number of lives that are destroyed along the way.\u201d Rory Stewart Stewart told the Telegraph last week he had smoked opium in Afghanistan at a wedding. \u201cI was invited into the house, the opium pipe was passed around at a wedding,\u201d he said, adding that the family may have been so poor that they put very little opium into the pipe. Matt Hancock A source close to Hancock told the Telegraph he had \u201ctried cannabis a few times as a student but has not taken any illicit drugs since\u201d. Esther McVey McVey told ITV she had never taken any class A drugs. \u201cI have never taken any class A drugs, but have I tried some pot? Yes I have. When I was much younger.\u201d Mark Harper The former chief whip said had not taken \u201cdrugs or any illegal substances\u201d, but added he did think it was fair for candidates to be the next prime minister to answer questions about any past illegal activity. Sam Gyimah The former universities minister has denied taking any drugs. \u201cLots of calls from journos today on personal drug use,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cNot my vice, never has been.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
