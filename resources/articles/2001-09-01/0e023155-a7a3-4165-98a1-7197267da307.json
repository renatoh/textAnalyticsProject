But Christoph Eschenbach's performance of the Second Symphony with the Orchestre de Paris was no half-hearted, apologetic interpretation. His energy and focus revealed the completeness and conviction of Schumann's symphonic vision. The slow movement was especially prophetic. The long melodic lines sounded like a precursor to Bruckner's great adagios, and the weird fugue at the centre of the piece demonstrated the debt to Beethoven's Eroica Symphony. There are also premonitions of Brahms in the syncopated rhythms and liquid lyricism of the first movement. But the work is more than a collection of quotes and pre-echoes. What makes the symphony so individual is Schumann's structural design. Eschenbach relished its most original features: the way the slow introduction slides seamlessly into the first movement; the bizarre finale, which comes to a total standstill before an enormous, abundant coda. The Orchestre de Paris matched Schumann's range with refined and dynamic playing, and brought the same qualities to Stravinsky's Rite of Spring. The opening bassoon solo, written at the extremes of the instrument's register, is one of the most challenging in the repertoire. But bassoonist Marc Trenel eclipsed these technical challenges, and in his hands Stravinsky's invocation of pagan ritual sounded languid and urbane. He set the tone for Eschenbach's approach to the whole score. Long gone are the days when the Rite presented almost insurmountable difficulties to any orchestra, but rarely can the piece have sounded as polished as it did here. Rather than bestial abandon, this was a Rite of sonic splendour and virtuoso technique. Eschenbach connected the piece with the colour and fantasy of Stravinsky's earlier ballets, and showed off the glories of his orchestra, especially its vibrant woodwind section. \u0095 This concert will be broadcast on Radio 3 on September 20.
