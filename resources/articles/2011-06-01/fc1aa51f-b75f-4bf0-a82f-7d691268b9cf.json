He developed a unique style full of vibrato-humming fast runs, piano-like trills and sax-like speed. Reinhardt later led the celebrated Quintette du Hot Club de France with violinist St\u00e9phane Grappelli, toured the US in 1947 with Duke Ellington, and is regarded as Europe's first jazz improvising genius."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
