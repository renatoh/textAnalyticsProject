According to Next-Gen.biz the 'one-of-a-kind music game' is set for release late next year. Matsuura has also recently committed to speaking at the forthcoming D.I.C.E summit in Las Vegas where he could well shed more light on the project. Pa Rappa was, of course, one of the pioneers of the 'rhythm action' genre, alongside the likes of Konami's Beatmania and Metro's Bust-A-Move. It was also a key title in Sony's drive to market PlayStation as a mainstream 'lifestyle' product. Unapologetically 2D and 'uncool' the title seemed to be working against the ethos that brought us Wipeout, but it drew non-gamers to the screen like nothing before. Can the duo ever have this impact again, especially on Wii which is already an accepted mainstream phenomenon? I'm certainly looking forward to finding out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
