Brandis gave an unusually frank account of the internal rancour generated by the citizenship revocation proposal pursued by Tony Abbott before he lost the Liberal party leadership in an effort to contextualise why the solicitor-general, Justin Gleeson, was consulted irregularly on the citizenship laws. \u201cAs you will recall, this was an issue of very significant political controversy in the late days of the Abbott government,\u201d Brandis told the ABC on Thursday. \u201cIt was an issue on which, to be blunt, the cabinet was divided between on the one hand, me, Mr Turnbull and Julie Bishop and others, and on the other hand, the then prime minister Mr Abbott, and Mr Dutton, who was then the responsible minister, as to how extensive the power of executive detention should be. \u201cThere were many, many chapters to this political controversy, during the course of which Mr Gleeson was involved from time to time.\u201d Brandis contended the breadth of consultations with Gleeson as the government\u2019s internal dispute unfolded were sufficient to validate a claim he made to the Labor party that Gleeson had advised the package had a good prospect of clearing the high court. Gleeson contested this in an extraordinary submission to a Senate inquiry. He said he gave advice on the first drafts of the citizenship bill in 2014 but was not consulted on the version later introduced to parliament. Gleeson insisted the government did not seek his counsel in an orderly way on sensitive legal proposals, including whether its contentious policy to revoke citizenship for dual nationals was constitutional \u2013 which was a major concern about the package \u2013 and the legal mechanisms proposed to pursue marriage equality. The complaint is part of a simmering disagreement between Australia\u2019s first and second law officers that has been playing out behind the scenes for months. The argument entered the public domain on Wednesday, when Gleeson indicated via his submission to a Senate inquiry that the government had consulted him only intermittently on contentious legal questions, and Brandis had not consulted him before issuing a government-wide directive that all requests for legal advice come through him. Brandis told parliament earlier this year he had consulted the solicitor general about the new directive, an account emphatically rejected by Gleeson. Gleeson\u2019s detailed account of events has prompted Labor to call for the attorney to resign. \u201cHe\u2019s lied to the Senate, he\u2019s lied to the Australian people,\u201d said the shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgraceful act by the attorney general and he should be resigning. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t resign then Mr Turnbull, who is after all \u2026 was once a lawyer, should sack him.\u201d Brandis has batted off calls for his resignation. He has used a not-yet-published submission to the Senate inquiry to argue he did consult Gleeson, and he used radio and television interviews on Thursday morning to insist he had not misled the parliament. Brandis said his account of their conversation could be backed up by two contemporaneous note makers and \u201cthose notes show without doubt\u201d Gleeson was consulted about the directive. The meeting notes have been given to the Senate inquiry as part of the Brandis submission. \u201cI have not misled the parliament,\u201d Brandis told ABC Radio National. \u201cThere were consultations. \u201cWhat this was about what regularising an administrative practice.\u201d Brandis conceded Gleeson had proposed a method where legal briefs would come to him and he would inform Brandis of the request \u2013 instead of the system Brandis ultimately mandated, which was the attorney general was the first port of call. Despite the obvious difference between those two propositions, Brandis claimed there was no \u201csignificant difference\u201d between the proposals. He insisted their relationship remained functional. He said he had never had \u201ca cross word\u201d with Gleeson, and could continue to work with him, despite their relationship deteriorating into a public slanging match."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
