Well, as we were to learn so painfully, Tim Henman left another job undone - no disgrace, mind, in losing 6-3 6-4 6-4 to Roger Federer, the best player in the world - and the Queen can have a lie-in. He had done well to get this far, battling a minor back niggle and a couple of qualifiers among his obstacles en route to yesterday's semi-final. But, if the rigours of the tournament took some sharpness from his game, he wasn't about to use that as an excuse. He never does. He has given so many almost-victory speeches they must be lodged just behind his tonsils and this was just another semi-final loss, another nearly day in a career of many nearly days. Henman showed rare tetchiness in the past week, refusing one request for an interview, and veterans on the Timbobeat imagined this might be disguising a further hardening of his psyche. No, as it turned out. He was poised, as usual, occasionally brilliant, as usual, and fragile, as usual. Henman had the crowd from the start, and not just the sprinkling of Brits in New York who happened to get tickets. As ever, he had them all on the edge of their seats one moment and sliding resignedly back into them the next. Few tennis players in recent years have been able to inspire such empathy. He again brought his grasscourt game to an alien surface, with adjustments, and it was working fine until Federer broke him for a 4-2 lead and closed out the first set. Henman continued to rush and chip fearlessly, a high-risk strategy borne of belief as much as desperation. This is what got him into the semis at Roland Garros and Wimbledon and this would do just fine for Flushing Meadows. In the second, he mixed it up a little, waiting until he had taken the heat of Federer's fiercest returns before going in for the volley. He got to deuce before the Swiss struck a startling lob to hold serve. Then Henman's game got a little flaky. Curiously, the Briton was doing nearly all his best work with his back to the TV commentary box, perhaps subconsciously more relaxed. Federer only occasionally lost his composure, but he went 5-3 up without much ceremony, Henman held, weakly, then Federer closed it out. The third was, predictably, full of twists. Federer broke in the first game and cruised to 5-1 before Henman found his game again. Against all the odds - a position in which he seems most comfortable - he broke back twice before Federer served to love and ended our misery. Today, Federer has a chance to make history, going for his fourth major. For the sake of tennis, wish him well. Lleyton Hewitt, though clear second best on form and at the bookmakers, will have plenty left after another easy win, this one over Sweden's Joachim Johansson in one of the dullest semi-finals anyone here could remember. The combatants, if that is not a transgression of the trades description act, are not only good friends but soon might be related. The Swede goes out with the Australian's sister, Jaslyn, who sat in Lleyton's box, a companion for his mum, Cherilyn. So, all chummed up and ready for action, the boys played as if they were having a hit-up on a local court. In an incongruously quiet bowl, the match passed quietly into the record books, 6-4 7-5 6-3 for Hewitt, who produced nine aces and just two fist-pumps, a very low count. 'I just kept my professional hat on,' he said later. And back to front, as usual. Johansson upped his aces from 106 to 123 for the tournament, but four double-faults at key moments hurt him. Hewitt accepted them gladly and kept his mistakes to a minimum. \u00b7 Andrew Murray, Henman's Davis Cup team-mate, gave Britain some better news by beating his German opponent for a place in the US Open boys singles final. Murray, 17, a survivor of the Dunblane school massacre in 1996, enhanced his growing reputation with a 6-3 6-2 semi-final win over Mihail Zverev. His opponent in the final will be Ukrainian seventh seed Sergiy Stakhovsky. You've read the piece, now have your say.
