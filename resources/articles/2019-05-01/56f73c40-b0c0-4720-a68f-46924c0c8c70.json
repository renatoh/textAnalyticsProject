The London clubs will face one another in Baku on 29 May while Liverpool will take on Tottenham in the Champions League final in Madrid on 1 June. Arsenal beat Valencia 4-2 to win their semi-final tie 7-3 while Chelsea sealed their place in the final by beating Eintracht Frankfurt 4-3 on penalties after the match finished 1-1 after extra time, with the aggregate score 2-2. It will be the first time in the history of European football that one country has monopolised the two finals and means that both trophies will head to England. \u201cHere the level is very high,\u201d said Chelsea\u2019s Italian manager Maurizio Sarri. \u201cIf you think that, to get to the final of the League Cup, we had to play against Liverpool, against Tottenham \u2013 the finalists of the Champions League \u2013 and then we played against, in my opinion, the best team in Europe in the final, Manchester City, you can understand the level here is very high. \u201cAt this moment, the Premier League is the best championship in Europe and, as a consequence, in the world. But it\u2019s not easy for an English team to arrive in the last month in a very good condition, physically, because here we play more than in the other countries.\u201d Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who scored a hat-trick for Arsenal, was asked what reaching the final meant to Arsenal. He said: \u201cIt means a lot. I think we have learned from last season [when they were eliminated in the semi-finals]. This year we didn\u2019t make the same mistakes, so now we are through to the final and we are all happy.\u201d Both Arsenal and Chelsea will receive only 6,000 tickets for the final in Baku\u2019s Olympic Stadium despite it having a capacity of 68,700. Arsenal released a statement soon after the final whistle insisting they are working with Uefa to gain a larger percentage of seats to add to the \u201cdisappointing ticket allocation\u201d. \u201cThis disappointing ticket allocation presents us with extreme difficulties in how we allocate tickets to you, our loyal supporters. As many of you will be aware, we are proud to have approximately 45,000 season-ticket holders and over 180,000 official members. \u201cIt is inevitable that with an allocation of just 6,000 tickets for the final, there will be thousands of fans who have supported the club for years and been part of our Europa League journey this season, who will be unable to attend this match. This is a disappointing situation.\u201d There have been Champions League finals contested by clubs from the same nation before. Real Madrid beat Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 2014 and 2016. J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s Borussia Dortmund lost to Bayern Munich at Wembley in 2013 while Manchester United and Chelsea played in the last all-English final in 2008, with United winning on penalties. Milan beat Juventus on penalties in 2003 while Real beat Valencia in 2000. There have been a dozen one-country match-ups in the junior competitions. There had been three all-Spanish finals in the Fairs Cup before it gave way to the Uefa Cup, whose very first final, in 1972, was an all-English affair. Spurs played Wolves over two legs, winning 3-2 on aggregate. There have been a further eight other finals since between sides from the same country, most recently when Atl\u00e9tico beat Athletic Bilbao in 2012. However, there has never been four clubs from the same country featuring in both of European football\u2019s finals and many will argue that the billions flowing into the Premier League are now having a direct effect on those competitions. Arsenal and Chelsea\u2019s victories came after Liverpool and Spurs marched into the Champions League final following dramatic semi-final wins. Klopp\u2019s side overcame a 3-0 first-leg deficit to beat Barcelona 4-0 at Anfield and win the tie 4-3, while Tottenham were 3-0 down on aggregate against Ajax before Lucas Moura\u2019s hat-trick completed an unlikely last-minute comeback in Amsterdam, as they drew the tie 3-3 and went through on away goals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
