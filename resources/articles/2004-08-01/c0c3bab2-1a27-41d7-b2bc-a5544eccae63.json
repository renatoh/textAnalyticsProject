The result is that every paper has been splashing with different stories, as demonstrated by yesterday's editions. \"Golkar leaders fighting for crumbs\", was the lead in Rakyat Merdeka, after the largest party in parliament saw its candidate defeated in the first round of the country's first direct presidential election. \"Hundreds of legislators-elect have problems\", was Koran Tempo's preference, in an article that discussed the legal difficulties facing members of provincial and district councils, and the national parliament. \"Government sees limited oil-hike impact\", was the duller choice of the English-language Jakarta Post's newly appointed editor, although that was brightened by an unrelated photo underneath of a full washing line - the country's longest, at 2.4 miles. Republika, a newspaper whose owner is the campaign manager of President Megawati Sukarnoputri's closest rival in the elections, used a quiet day to have another go at Ms Megawati, accusing her and her running mate of refusing to admit accepting illegal campaign contributions. Kompas, the nation's most widely read broadsheet, told its readers: \"Bosses pay for processing of Indonesian workers' documents\". The story covered the impending crackdown by Malaysian authorities on illegal foreign workers. Malaysian plantation workers are hastily \"legalising\" their workers to escape sanction. Perhaps the only consistent newspaper was the capital's leading tabloid, City Post, which stuck to its usual fare with the following: \"After angering her foster mother, young orphan girl is burnt\". The strap underneath read: \"Enraged mob try to destroy the foster home\". The weeklies, however, were all on the same page, playing catch-up on the previous big story, the constitutional court's decision to deem as invalid the prosecutions of the perpetrators of the Bali bombing in 2002, because they were conducted under a piece of legislation enacted after the atrocity. \"Will they go free?\" was Tempo's simple headline, above photos of four of the ringleaders. The inside pages of the papers, too, were concentrating on some of the same stories. One is the murder of Amanda Devina, a 22-year-old student at one of Jakarta's more prestigious private universities. What made this case unique for Indonesia was the double life the woman, who had committed what is - in the eyes of many Indonesians - the sin of becoming pregnant outside marriage. She paid for it with her life. In a leader headlined \"Amanda is a portrait of our society\", the conservative Republika blamed the tragedy on the fact that \"our society's lifestyle is changing\". It urged the government to reflect that \"political life should not just be about power ... We want our families to be protected. We want a different world where our children are not deviating. We are in a transitional phase and our destruction at this time is the result of the negligence of those in power. Save our soul.\" The Jakarta Post, meanwhile, was outraged that Indonesia will be the only country competing at the Athens Olympics not broadcasting the games. In an editorial headlined \"Indonesia's Greek Tragedy\", the newspaper complained: \"We believe there is a problem of scheduling, and commercial stations are simply reluctant to sacrifice their prime-time, money-spinning reality and quiz shows for the Olympic games.\" Guessing that Indonesia's declining sporting fortunes in recent years could be partly to blame for the lack of broadcast interest, the newspaper continued: \"Given Indonesia's low standing in international and regional sports, our failure to broadcast the event, live or otherwise, would further undermine our national interest in sports and in our capacity to understand the age-old Olympic traditions of honouring excellence, international friendship and solidarity.\" Indonesia's slow season is unlikely to last much longer, however. Yesterday the government carried out its first execution in three years, of an Indian drug smuggler, and, if the TV news is anything to go by, that should dominate today's front pages."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
