On what is a competitive card the best bet comes in the opening race in the shape of Bonus Bridge (2.10) , who is confidently expected to cope with the step up in distance and class in the Grosvener Casinos Novice Chase. The Henry Daly-trained runner has plenty of stamina in his pedigree and the three miles around this stiff track should be very much in his favour. He has jumped well in his four races over fences so far and today's fast going should be much more to his liking than when an odds-on failure in soft conditions behind Cameron Bridge at Exter last month. High Cotton will have his supporters following his fine fourth in the National Hunt Chase at the Cheltenham Fes tival last time but may have been flattered in that one-off marathon event for amateur riders and is best judged on his exposed form in novice chases. Tony McCoy can make a winning comeback on his first ride since being injured at the Cheltenham Festival with victory on Deano's Beeno (2.40) in the sportingoptions.co.uk Long Distance Hurdle. His mount has an excellent record at this track and while Brother Joe and Landing Light will have the ground in their favour they have been expensive to follow in recent times. Far Horizon (4.20) has demonstrated form of sufficicent class to suggest that the Rosling King Novice Hurdle is his for the taking. At Ripon the six-furlong handicap is by far the most intriguing race of the day. High numbers have a major adavantage at this course in large fields at sprint distances and Full Spate (3.35) is ideally drawn in stall 19. Inch Again (3.05) has always looked the type to do well this season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
