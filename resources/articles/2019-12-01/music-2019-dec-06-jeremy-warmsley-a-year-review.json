Two albums in, the Londoner swapped indie sad-laddery for deliciously kitsch earworms as one half of Summer Camp. More recently, he has carved out a successful sideline in film and TV soundtracking. Clearly, however, Warmsley\u2019s appetite for the singer-songwriter life remains, and in 2019 he committed to creating and releasing a new song every month. The results constitute A Year, an album that ties the changing of the seasons to the spark, flame and fizzling out of a new romance; an emotional bell curve Warmsley cleverly mirrors in the album\u2019s ever-shifting sound. The melancholic, searching springtime songs nod to Simon and Garfunkel; strange, jerking time signatures herald the unsettling elation of infatuation; hints of eurodance and new wave echo a fractious summer. Finally, an autumn breakup brings the mumble of Arthur Russell-style strings and shades of restorative soul. To Warmsley\u2019s credit, all this conspicuous genre-hopping doesn\u2019t disrupt the flow of the record: everything is united by its maker\u2019s homespun, slightly weedy sensibility and his ear for infectious melody. At the same time, the album\u2019s conceptual basis and multitude of pop tropes make it seem more like a thoughtful showcase of songwriting talent than a loud statement of solo-artist intent. After a decade out of the game, Warmsley\u2019s return as a singer-songwriter is not so much a stop-the-presses comeback as a modest reminder of his considerable skills."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
