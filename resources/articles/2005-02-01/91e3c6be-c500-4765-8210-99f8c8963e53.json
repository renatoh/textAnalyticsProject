Robben is a big player for Chelsea and they'll miss him over the next six weeks or so, but I still think they will win the title and just about beat Barcelona in the Champions League as well. Things will be more difficult without Robben because they will have to change their style and their goalscoring will be affected. Psychologically it's a test and in some ways it's their first major worry. But I think the defensive strength they've got will see them through. What happens at Everton tomorrow will tell us a lot about how tight things might become. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson will be hoping that Everton can do their clubs a favour and a lot of neutrals will want the same. Nothing against Chelsea but I'd like the title race to be more exciting. A draw for Chelsea would help, provided that Arsenal and Manchester United win, and a defeat would really liven things up. Even then I don't see Chelsea throwing the league away. They're so strong defensively that I think they'll take the title with the lowest ever number of goals conceded. They showed at the start of the season that they can win games without Robben and Damien Duff. It was 1-0 a lot of the time and they might go back to that because when they were flying it was Robben who made them exciting. I don't see them scoring as many goals without him or making as many chances. They had chances against Manchester City on Sunday but they were scrambled chances rather than great ones. It will be interesting to see how Jose Mourinho changes things now. He hasn't got anybody to replace Robben so he'll have to adapt. The system Chelsea have been playing works with Robben and Duff because they're the only ones who can play as old-fashioned inside forwards and genuine wingers. Mourinho could carry on with one man through the middle and play Duff wide and Joe Cole behind the striker in a free role. Or he can play two up front, and that would be my choice. If Chelsea really don't want to lose they can go with Duff and one other as the strikers and play four narrow midfielders to keep things tight. Or they can use two strikers, plus Duff on one wing and maybe Tiago on the other. I'm sure Mourinho will have a plan for Barcelona and I just fancy Chelsea. I saw Barcelona at the beginning of the season and they were fantastic but recently they have looked off the boil. I think this is a good time for Chelsea to meet them. I watched Barcelona lose on Saturday night, when Ronaldinho missed a penalty, and they won't beat Chelsea like that. Ronaldinho's not playing as well as he was and they miss Henrik Larsson because he's always a goal threat, whether he plays from the start or comes on. Also, Samuel Eto'o has dried up a bit and Ludovic Giuly is not playing at the same level that he has been. I expect Barcelona will play quite an open game but I don't want to hear Mourinho complaining about the way other teams set up against Chelsea. Opponents are going to stand up and close them down and they have to get used to it and accept it. I'm afraid that's what happens when you are a top side. Most teams are not as talented or wealthy as Chelsea and they're not going to stand back and let them play. It's something Manchester United have had to put up with for years and Liverpool had the same before them. Chelsea have to accept as well that players like Robben, Duff and Cole are going to get kicked when opponents are going for the ball and are caught out by just how quick those players are. They are lucky to play in an era when the really nasty, calculated horror tackle has gone and opponents can't get away with kicking lumps out of you. If you go back to George Best's time, or even 10 or 15 years ago, the first tackle was free. If you had the Arsenal back four against you and they all had one free tackle you got a right good whack. I remember once getting a hole in my ankle against them that needed stitching and ending up in hospital afterwards. The tackle that injured Robben wasn't cynical but he is unlucky to be out for this long. Chelsea will miss him, but I think they'll be all right."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
