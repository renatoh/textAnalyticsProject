In London, the mood was sombre and at 1.45pm today hundreds of traders across the City held a minute's silence out of respect for the dead and injured. The London Stock Exchange director of operations, Andrew McStravick, said that during this period member firms refrained from trading. Other exchangesalso marked their respect. London-based futures and options exchange LIFFE also observed a minute's silence, while European exchanges Euronext and Deutsche Bourse also participated. The London-based International Petroleum Exchange, where hundreds of traders work, held a minute's silence at 11am while the London Metals Exchange held a minute's silence at noon. A spokesman for the LME, which has about 200 traders, said: \"It is in respect of those who have lost their lives. We have many member firms who had offices at the towers. \"The mood today is very sombre, and also very busy, but very determined that business will carry on as usual.\" In response to the tragic events, the FTSE, too, held all its indices at 1.45pm, for one minute. \"This move is in line with the suspended trading conditions, which was observed by the London and other European stock exchanges today,\" it said. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq remain closed, with trading in US shares not expected to reopen until tomorrow at the earliest. A spokesman for Nasdaq said the situation was being monitored and assessed by the hour. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and the families they leave behind,\" he said. Nasdaq Europe, based in Brussels, will open today but trading in US equities is closed. In London, the market was moving erratically as investors tried to gauge the impact of yesterday's outrages. A wave of panic selling in the first 10 minutes of trading caused more than \u00a321bn to be wiped from the FTSE 100 as the index dived 94 points, but it later surged 135 points ahead. By mid-morning it had stabilised to stand up just 10.6 points at 4756.6. Traders said most City institutions seemed to be holding on to their shares, a fact that had helped the Footsie to recover its early losses. Blue chips were hit by the topsy-turvy nature of the day, one moment topping the leader board and then losing ground. British Airways, which plunged yesterday after cancelling its US flights, made early progress but then fell back, off a further 7%, or 14p, to 194p. Oil giants Shell and BP were also weighing on the market, falling 28.5p and 27p to 514.5p and 561.5p respectively. Tom Hougaard, trader and technical analyst at City bookies Financial Spreads described the conditions as volatile. He said the German market was having a hard time keeping its gains and, as a result, the Footsie was losing steam, as well as France's CAC 40. \"Volume is light and that exacerbates volatility,\" he said. \"It is unknown when the US reopens for trading and despite assurance from the FED that liquidity will be provided to restore confidence, our clients are running for cover. \"Everyone wants to know what is going on, but nobody really knows. As one client said - no reason to buy now when no-one knows what is going to happen.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
