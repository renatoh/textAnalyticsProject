The US president on Thursday returned to the White House briefing room, scene of past triumphs such as that time he proposed bleach as a cure for coronavirus and that other time he condemned QAnon with the words \u201cThey like me\u201d. Trump offered a downright dangerous and dishonest take on this week\u2019s election that current vote counting trends suggest he will lose. It was possibly an attempt to intimidate and deter TV networks from declaring a winner in the next few hours. It also risked inciting protests and violence from supporters encouraged to view Joe Biden as an illegitimate president-elect. Sombre and downbeat, Trump made false claims from a prepared statement ( is that better or worse than ad-libbing lies?) \u201cIf you count the legal votes, I easily win,\u201d he said with a straight face. \u201cIf you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us. If you count the votes that came in late \u2013 we\u2019re looking at them very strongly, a lot of votes came in late.\u201d It was a bold, dramatic claim with massive implications and absolutely no foundation. Having often dismissed the significance of Vladmir Putin\u2019s hackers\u2019 meddling four years ago, Trump implied that opinion polls are a more sinister threat. \u201cMedia polling was election interference, in the truest sense of that word by powerful special interests,\u201d he said. \u201cThese really phony polls ... were designed to keep our voters at home, create the illusion of momentum for Mr Biden and diminish Republicans\u2019 ability to raise funds. They were what\u2019s called suppression polls.\u201d Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator from Connecticut, tweeted: \u201cThis is just extraordinary. It\u2019s a lie every 5 second. Not small lies either. Just nuclear grade whoppers.\u201d The president went on to throw in some racism for good measure, targeting Philadelphia and Detroit, both African American majority cities in the battlegrounds Pennsylvania and Michigan respectively. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to rig an election, and we can\u2019t let that happen,\u201d he said. \u201cDetroit and Philadelphia \u2013 known as two of the most corrupt political places anywhere in our country.\u201d The man who, during his property developing career, perfected the dark art of \u201ctruthful hyperbole\u201d sounded a wholly unrealistic note. \u201cWe think we will win the election very easily. \u201cWe think there\u2019s going to be a lot of litigation because we have so much evidence, so much proof, and it\u2019s going to end up perhaps at the highest court in the land \u2026 We can\u2019t have an election stolen like this.\u201d In a circular argument, he claimed he had predicted this debacle all along: in effect, his old lies were proof of his new ones. Gesturing towards the press, he said: \u201cI have been talking about this for many months with all of you and I\u2019ve said very strongly that mail-in ballots are going to be a disaster ... We\u2019re hearing stories that are horror stories.\u201d He was done after 16 minutes and walked from the podium, ignoring a loud barrage of questions. To the simplest of all, \u201cwhere\u2019s the evidence?\u201d, he clearly had no answer. No one can accuse Trump of failing to rise to the big occasion. This was a record-breaking performance by the liar-in-chief. Daniel Dale, a factchecker at CNN, wrote on Twitter: \u201cI\u2019ve read or watched all of Trump\u2019s speeches since 2016. This is the most dishonest speech he has ever given.\u201d Perhaps the bogus claims of fraud will eventually allow Trump to quietly slip away while saving face, contending that he would have won re-election but for cheating establishment forces beyond his control. He used to promise his supporters: we\u2019re going to win so much, you\u2019ll be sick and tired of winning. Not half as much as he is unable to contemplate the reality of losing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
