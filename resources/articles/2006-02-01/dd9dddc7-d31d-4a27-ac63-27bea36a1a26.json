We were young, but it seemed perfectly natural to cook porridge for 58 people,start a coal-fired Aga, leave the window open for the cat when we went on holiday for two weeks and walk three miles to the nearest pub. Does anyone still have the booted crossroads stamp on their membership card? We designed that. And the Formica on the dining room tables? We nailed that on. How very sad then to read of the hostel's possible closure. It was a place we loved and where we fell in love. I Mills Leeds Steve Boggan (Coca is a way of life, February 9) describes the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) as \"the paramilitaries controlling cocaine production in Colombia\". The paramilitaries are, in fact, known as the AUC - a Colombian-government backed organisation described by the former head of the Drug Enforcement Agency, James Milford, as \"among the most powerful drug trafficking groups in Colombia\". Farc is a leftwing guerrilla insurgency fighting against the Colombian state. Liam Craig-Best Justice for Colombia An Estonian friend who came here as a displaced person in the 1940s told me that she did not know what kind of country she had arrived in as she landed in Hull, which means \"mad\" in Estonian, with the head of state being the king, Estonian for \"shoe\".

Weren't we supposed to be having a very cold winter this year? Ray Duff Folkestone, Kent Here in 1066 country there is a local firm called William the Concreter (Letters, February 11).
