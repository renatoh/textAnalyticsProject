It could spin the service into a residual poor law-type institution. A \u00a32bn deficit is forecast to rise to an annual \u00a330bn deficit within seven years \u2013 a cool one-third of the current budget. That \u00a330bn is equivalent to a 5p increase on every pound of taxable income. So the deficit cannot be met by increasing revenue alone. No government is going to get elected on such a ticket, even though the NHS is the one institution that British voters most love. The only alternative is to strike a new deal with those voters. The submission to the policy review I am making this week seeks to transfer NHS and social care costs to the national insurance scheme. A penny increase in contributions \u2013 like the 2002 changes \u2013 will plug half the deficit. The other half must be met by a total rethink of how the service must be delivered around patient needs. But politicians got their sticky fingers on half of that 2002 increase in revenue. A new national mutual \u2013 independent of government but not of voters \u2013 must be established to receive all the funds and drive through reform. Kristian Niemietz, senior research fellow at the Institute of Economic Affairs In the future, user charges should play a much greater role in healthcare financing. Well-designed user charges would not just raise additional revenue, but would also limit unnecessary demand, encourage greater cost-effectiveness in the use of healthcare services, and promote the adoption of healthy lifestyles. There is a lot that can be learned from successful international examples, such as Switzerland, where out-of-pocket payments from patients account for more than a quarter of total health expenditure. Deductibles, co-payments and reimbursement limits could all have a role to play, provided they are coupled with annual ceilings and exemptions for the low-paid. Norman Warner, former Labour health minister We can't rely on income tax and national insurance increases to plug the 2020 \u00a330bn NHS funding gap. They are taxes on jobs, and the public don't connect them with funding the NHS that they care about. We need a dedicated national health and care fund for integrated health and care. This would require some general taxation but could be gradually built up with more money from hypothecated taxes associated with health and consumption of care. This means using taxes on tobacco, alcohol, unhealthy foods, gambling and inheritance, and possibly a compulsory insurance tax at age 50, to pay for social care in old age, as in Japan. We might also have to dip into our own pockets more, with holiday vaccination payments, higher prescription charges and hospital hotel costs, plus making NHS continuing care means-tested. Dr Peter Carter, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing With the NHS caring for an increasing number of patients in the face of severe budget constraints, the future of its funding has never been as important or as pressing a question. Earlier this month, nursing staff at the RCN's annual congress debated whether a possible solution to its current challenges would be to introduce patient charges for GP visits. It's a controversial suggestion, but nurses are not shy of tackling these crucial issues head on. After carefully considering the implications, 91% of delegates voted against the proposal \u2013 reaffirming the RCN's belief that the NHS should be free at the point of delivery. Nursing staff are passionate advocates for the NHS and know that, even with mounting pressures and stretched finances, it remains an excellent service. Providing patients with high-quality care requires sufficient resources and robust long-term planning, and shying away from difficult debates over these issues isn't going to do the health service any favours in the long run. The next general election is on the horizon, and politicians of all parties should follow our lead by clearly setting out their plans for ensuring that the NHS remains the best health service in the world."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
