Though a sort of anthology, it is more like a handsomely produced scrapbook, with photographic reproductions of original letters, draft articles and scribbled notes. (Great diplomacy has been shown in getting the permissions to reproduce some of these.) The result is a kind of coffee table book of intellectual contention. The LRB began in 1979, when the labour dispute at the Times meant that the Times Literary Supplement was not appearing. Karl Miller, former editor of the Listener and head of English at University College London, decided to start a new review. His former deputy at the Listener, Mary-Kay Wilmers, joined him. This volume illustrates the LRB\u2019s rickety yet oddly confident beginnings, first as an insert within the New York Review of Books, which initially provided necessary funding. It split off a year later. Wilmers had inherited some money \u2013 \u201cI didn\u2019t want it \u2026 So I found a use for it\u201d \u2013 and when Miller left in 1992 Wilmers became editor, and is still. The first issue still seems impressive, with William Empson on A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, John Bayley\u2019s review of William Golding\u2019s Darkness Visible, and new poems by Ted Hughes and Seamus Heaney. Pages reproduced from early issues are, however, forbidding: unbroken columns of print as far as the eye can see. The LRB demonstrated its intellectual seriousness by allowing contributors unparalleled wordage. (Cannily, the compilers have chosen to reprint only tantalising snippets of interesting items rather than whole pieces.) We see the page from Miller\u2019s jotter with its list of desired contributors, most of whom are eventually nabbed. A few grand refuseniks are commemorated. Karl Popper, both lofty and needy, had his assistant at LSE tell the LRB that he didn\u2019t write reviews but would be \u201cinterested to know if you have published reviews of his own books\u201d. Of the 66 well-known names on Miller\u2019s intellectual celebrity list, just six are women. There is later some fretting about the predominance of male contributors in the LRB\u2019s recent as well as distant history. It may seem odd to have a coffee table book where the pictures are of texts, but many of these are surprisingly expressive. There is the extraordinary typed letter from the poet Laura Riding complaining about Martin Seymour-Smith\u2019s biography of her former partner, Robert Graves. \u201cMr Miller!\u201d it begins, before expressing indignation in rambling sentences, where the very print \u2013 letters overtyped, words crossed out \u2013 is a chart of her feelings. It is a reminder of what an eloquent mess a typewriter could make. In contrast, the thickly but precisely corrected typescript of Julian Barnes\u2019s Diary article about the Booker prize (\u201cposh bingo\u201d) is a diagram of fastidiousness. We get the graphic drama, as it were, of the handwritten letter, in what looks like blue felt-tip, from Bruce Chatwin in 1988, protesting against an article about Aids by John Ryle \u2013 indeed protesting at the very use of the word \u201cAids\u201d. The un-joined-up script somehow makes the repressed fury all the clearer. Differently eloquent is the magnified note of thanks to Frank Kermode, for his review of The Blue Flower, from Penelope Fitzgerald, written in a hand both eccentric and highly legible: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether you\u2019d agree that writing, like teaching, produces considerable spells of depression &amp; moments of great happiness.\u201d Somehow it is great to see the actual faxed page of an extremely anxious lawyer\u2019s advice about a Christopher Hitchens piece on Conrad Black. \u201cThe real problem comes with Christopher Hitchens\u2019s opinions about Mr Black \u2013 that he is a mad, tyrannical egotist, a sinister eccentric, a megalomaniac.\u201d There is also a problem with the Labour politician Michael Meacher being designated \u201ca prefect with a reputation for frigid sadism\u201d. An editorial pen has written \u201ccut\u201d alongside both offending flowers of rhetoric. There are some good spats. Here is Al Alvarez\u2019s ex\u2011wife, Ursula Creagh, reviewing his book Life After Marriage: Scenes from a Divorce \u2013 and then, for good measure, Kermode writing to Miller to express his indignation at this \u201cvirtually inexcusable\u201d choice of reviewer. \u201cI do not believe in \u2018unprejudiced\u2019 reviewing,\u201d Miller unanswerably replies, signing off with the sad acknowledgement that \u201cthe time has come for us to have no more to do with one another\u201d. What Dr Johnson called \u201cthe acrimony of scholiasts\u201d gets its delicious due. In 1993 it is both Elaine Showalter v Camille Paglia and Judith Butler portentously denouncing Terry Eagleton. The LRB likes to show the LRB in process. On the one hand, pages proudly display memorandums in which the staff debate hyphens and the best ways to split words across the end of lines. On the other hand, we get the cock-ups over arty covers that turned out to be rubbish. LRB editors are exacting and are often themselves gifted writers (Andrew O\u2019Hagan, Susannah Clapp, John Lanchester). They also have a collective reputation for overconfidence, illustrated in some of these pages. O\u2019Hagan explains how staff disliked the last lines of poems that they were printing. \u201cThey were often too \u2018last-line-y\u2019.\u201d So some were just docked. There is an example here (\u201cCockcrow\u201d) from Patricia Beer, with her terse, infuriated letter of complaint. \u201cThe poem is, of course, ruined,\u201d she writes, with justification. Showing process also means displaying political choices. Here is Wilmers\u2019s letter to Anne Applebaum, explaining that the journal had refused her review of a book on the last days of the Soviet Union because it spent too much time reminding the readers \u201cthat Stalin was bad\u201d. There is Hitchens, once a favourite son who faxed in copious copy at all hours, being disinvited to the intellectual gathering when his geopolitics shifted. The book reproduces some of the notorious collection of responses by LRB contributors to 9/11, with Marjorie Perloff\u2019s outrage that most think that, in a phrase she picks up from Mary Beard\u2019s piece, \u201cthe United States had it coming\u201d. As Wilmers nicely observes, \u201cBeard didn\u2019t quite say that, though she didn\u2019t wholly not\u201d. Devotees will appreciate the well-deserved tribute to advertising manager David Rose, who pioneered the LRB\u2019s famous personal ads (nowadays but shadows of their former selves, sadly). The book reproduces the very first such ads, from October 1998. Some of which deploy poetry, bursts of Spanish or allusions to the writings of Jacques Lacan \u2013 but some of which have a bluntness unmatched in the paper itself. \u201cBald, short, fat and ugly male, 53 seeks short-sighted woman with tremendous sexual appetite.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not gossipy, cosy or cliquey,\u201d observes long-time contributor Alan Bennett. But, in a mostly productive way, it is cliquey. It has always had favourites and has nurtured them. With pages catching the work of writers including Lorna Sage and Jenny Diski, this celebratory volume looks like a justification of that habit. There is a leading instance. Kermode evidently got over being told by Miller that this was the end and eventually contributed over 200 pieces (more than anyone else). That is the equivalent of at least 10 lengthy books. With his unrivalled ability to \u201chover as a writer between academia and journalism\u201d, he was the LRB\u2019s tutelary spirit.
