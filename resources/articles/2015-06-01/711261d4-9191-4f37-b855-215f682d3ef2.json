A report by the National Audit Office said the 25-year contract to train aircrew was supposed to be running at full capacity by 2014. Delays have meant that it will not be operating as planned until the end of 2019. If left to continue, the delayed programme could leave British forces struggling to train enough aircrew for military operations, auditors said. Amyas Morse, the NAO\u2019s head, said the MoD needed to get to grips with the programme and hold Ascent, the outsourcing consortium, to account. \u201cThe department needs to understand better actual training performance and what affects performance before it can secure significant improvements from Ascent. Otherwise, there is a real risk that moving to the new training will affect the military\u2019s ability to train the right number of aircrew at the right time,\u201d he said. The MoD trains crew for each of the armed services, including Wildcat helicopter pilots for the navy, Apache helicopter pilots for the army, and Typhoon fighter pilots for the air force. Ascent, a consortium of the two firms Lockheed Martin and Babcock International, was originally awarded the 25-year contract to train aircrew in 2008. The contract meant that up to 480 pilots and their crew would receive \u201ccore training\u201d \u2013 including training exercises on how to fly helicopters and jets and use weapon systems. Auditors found that civil servants during the early years of the contract had \u201csignificant concerns\u201d about Ascent\u2019s performance. MoD officials were worried by rising costs and delays as well as the quality of the training, the report said, and \u201cthe department was concerned that Ascent was showing corporate and individual behaviours that undermined its partnering abilities\u201d. The report also highlights the MoD\u2019s failure to oversee the project properly. There were delays to helicopter training because civil servants did not realise that the government did not own its existing training aircraft. Civil servants struggled to hold Ascent to account, the report said. The MoD has so far paid more than \u00a3143m for the training contract, and has only been able to claw back \u00a3308,000 in deductions for Ascent\u2019s failure to meet its responsibilities. The MoD is also blamed for issuing a contract that does not stipulate significant fines if Ascent does not improve its performance. \u201cIncentives for improving core training form only around 1% of potential payments to Ascent,\u201d the report said. Delays were in part due to the substantial cuts in the numbers of aircrew undergoing training, which had seen the value of the contract cut from \u00a36.8bn to \u00a33.2bn. The number of pilots expected to be trained has dropped to 250. While Ascent\u2019s performance was considered to have improved since 2012 after the MoD raised its concerns with Ascent\u2019s shareholders, the NAO said there was still \u201cmuch to do\u201d if it was to achieve the planned benefits of the contract. Philip Dunne, the minister for defence procurement, welcomed the report. \u201cThe programme had a difficult start after initial contracts were let under a PFI contract in 2008,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are now on a much firmer footing and moving forward to deliver flight training for aircrew, more rapidly and efficiently, with greater flexibility to adapt to new platforms.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
