A rising star on the right, the younger Cheney is carrying the torch of uncompromising confrontation with those deemed to be a threat to America \u2013 from alleged terrorists to Tehran. Liz Cheney came up through a law firm with close ties to the Republicans before working as an aid officer in US embassies in eastern Europe. After her father became vice-president, she stepped in to a state department job that gave her control of a programme channelling money to pro-democracy groups in the Middle East. After leaving the state department, Liz Cheney became increasingly critical of some Bush administration policies for not being hardline enough, particularly towards Iran. Cheney said the US should support Israel if it launched an air strike against Iran's nuclear programme. But she has been a vocal defender of what her father euphemistically called enhanced interrogation techniques and others describe as torture. Cheney has tacitly sided with the \"birther\" movement which questions whether Barack Obama is legitimately elected because he is alleged to have been born in Kenya. She told CNN that the movement was in part driven by people being \"increasingly uncomfortable with an American president who seems to be afraid to defend America, stand up for what we believe in\". Her increasingly frequent television appearances have fuelled speculation that she is planning to run for political office. Last year, Cheney's sister, Mary, was quoted in the New York Times as saying: \"I think you'd be hard-pressed to find any daylight at all between Liz's and my father's views. It's not because she's been indoctrinated. It's because he's right.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
