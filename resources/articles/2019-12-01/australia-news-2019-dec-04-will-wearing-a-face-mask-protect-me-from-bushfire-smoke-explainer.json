Bushfire smoke carries PM2.5 particles \u2013 which have a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less \u2013 and can cause long-term health problems. People with asthma, lung disease or cardiovascular disease, and the young and the elderly, are all at particular risk, and New South Wales Health advises them to stay indoors and limit exposure on smoky days. Increasingly, people are turning to face masks. But are they any practical use? Dr Christine Cowie, a respiratory health expert from the Centre for Air Pollution, Energy and Health Research and the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, spoke to Guardian Australia. Will a mask do anything? In most cases, the answer is no. There are very few academic studies about the effectiveness of face masks, and wearing a mask is not the main recommended safety measure. Crucially, a surgeon\u2019s mask (or similar cloth or paper masks) won\u2019t work \u2013 the particles in bushfire smoke are too fine. Cowie says the only effective mask is a P2 mask \u2013 the kind worn by builders and sold in hardware stores. And, it has to seal well around your face. Which means you need to test it out for fit, like shoes or clothes. Different face and nose shapes will need different masks. \u201cIf it is not fitted very carefully over the nose and mouth, people will still be exposed to the smoke,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd you need to inspect the package and make sure it will filter out PM2.5.\u201d A spokesperson for the NSW Health reiterated that concern. \u201cP2 face masks can filter out most PM2.5. However, evidence suggests they may not work in practice as they require an extremely good fit.\u201d \u201cThis is difficult for people to achieve outside of an occupational setting where they can be properly fit-checked.\u201d Cowie says a mask is \u201cnot the best public health measure that we can offer\u201d. \u201cWe support the advice from the health department, which is to stay indoors and trying to minimise your exposure as much as possible.\u201d For those at particular risk, \u201cadhering to your medication program is the main messages we want to get out\u201d. Will an air purifier or air conditioner help? Cowie says the research is still \u201cnot sure\u201d about air conditioners. General household air conditioners do not have the filters needed for PM2.5. If one is used, it must be put on a recirculation setting so it is not taking in air from outside. Air purifiers \u2013 with a specific Hepa filter \u2013 could do more. \u201cThere are a few studies that indicate air purifiers are useful in reducing particulate matter indoors, but they do need to be fitted with a Hepa filter,\u201d Cowie says. Be aware that every purifier has a set amount of area it can purify. \u201cOne small air purifier will not do a whole house,\u201d Cowie says. A spokesperson for the NSW Health said in a statement: \u201cUsing air conditioning systems in recirculate mode can help reduce particles from indoor air. \u201cAir purifiers can reduce particles in a smaller indoor area such as a single room that is closed off from other areas, however, there is limited evidence of their effectiveness during bushfire smoke events.\u201d If vulnerable, see a doctor Above all, if in doubt, or if you are particularly vulnerable, see a doctor. This includes anyone with asthma, a cardiovascular or respiratory condition, or vulnerable people such as young children and the elderly. Cowie stresses that asthma attacks can be fatal. Those with asthma medication should have a preventer puffer (separate to a reliever puffer) and should use it every day. Those concerned about overusing their medicine should speak to their doctor and double-check their regime. She also advises that residents should try to check the most specific air quality index they can. The NSW Environmental Protection Agency and NSW Health put out health alerts, and people can subscribe to specific area air quality alerts. Again, pay specific attention to the PM2.5 reading \u2013 and be aware that it can vary widely between regions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
