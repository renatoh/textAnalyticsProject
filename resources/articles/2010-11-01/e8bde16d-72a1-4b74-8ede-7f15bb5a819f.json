That's six draws in seven now for Rangers, which has got to be a concern. Are all the draws, though, more worrying for a promotion-chasing side than their astonishing defensive record \u2013 seven goals conceded in 17 games now \u2013 is reassuring? Elsewhere, Luciano Becchio was dropped from Leeds's starting line-up but came off the bench to score a second-half hat-trick that brought his side a 3-1 home win over Bristol City and a place in the top six. The Argentinian was brought on with half an hour to play and the game still goalless to transform the match: within 10 minutes of his arrival there had been three goals, of which he'd scored two. I mentioned Darren Ambrose in midweek after his goal helped Crystal Palace beat Watford. Today he scored another two to bring Palace another home win, over Coventry, and is now \u2013 despite being injured between the end of August and the end of October \u2013 Palace's joint top scorer. They're no longer bottom of the table and, though I haven't seen them recently, they suddenly have an air of upward mobility. League One The bad news for Brighton &amp; Hove Albion is that they lost \u2013 for the first time since 21 August, a full 12 league games ago \u2013 3-1 at Hartlepool. The good news is that second-placed Huddersfield, third-placed Colchester and fourth-placed Peterborough lost as well. Charlton were the only winners in the top six, thrashing Posh 5-1 away from home. Peterborough drop to eighth but remain a remarkable team: they've scored 33 goals this season \u2013 no one in their division and only two of the 91 other teams in the Premier and Football Leagues have managed more. They have also conceded 33 goals this season \u2013 no one in their division and only one of the 91 other teams etc etc. In a few weeks they could celebrate the first anniversary of their last goalless draw. The day's most remarkable personal achievement came from Bournemouth's 20-year-old striker Josh McQuoid. In last week's FA Cup tie against Tranmere, his 80th senior appearance in all competitions, he scored the first hat-trick of his career. Against Walsall today, his 81st senior appearance, he scored his second. League Two Chesterfield remain top, despite losing their unbeaten home record to Burton Albion. Hereford's slightly less impressive home record continues \u2013 they still haven't won \u2013 after a 1-1 draw with Cheltenham. Wycombe beat Bradford 1-0 thanks to a rare and rather controversial double-advantage: most of Bradford's players stopped when the Chairboys' Stuart Beavon went down clutching his leg and the linesman started waving his flag, but the referee waved play on. Then the former Chelsea goalkeeper Lennie Pidgeley brought down Matt Bloomfield in the penalty area, but again the referee waved play on and Kevin Betsy tapped in. Bradford's former Wycombe manager Peter Taylor stormed on to the pitch in protest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
