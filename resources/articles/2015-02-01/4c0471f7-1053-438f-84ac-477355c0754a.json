Mark Lanegan, with whom Garwood collaborated on 2013\u2019s Black Pudding, calls him a \u201cmusical genius\u201d; Josh T Pearson says his songs are \u201cas close to heaven as you can get with a guitar\u201d. As this alt-leaning fanclub suggests, the London-based musician\u2019s approach to the genre is not the kind of dedicated study that forbids exploration: the title track, for instance, benefits from the ghostly backing vocals of Savages\u2019 Jehnny Beth, and some guitar work reminiscent of Tuareg band Tinariwen. Burning Seas, in particular, is a fascinating composition, a tangle of interweaving guitar licks that hover beneath a melody of pure 80s stadium pop \u2013 Garwood manages to make sounding like Bono seem impressively soulful. The second half of the record (this is Garwood\u2019s fifth solo album) sees him abandon the more accessible melodies for a sprawling, stripped-back sound that can be just as foreboding as track titles such as Hawaiian Death Song suggest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
