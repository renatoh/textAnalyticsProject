The US is caught on the back foot after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese are better equipped; the American fighter planes are creaky crates, and their torpedoes have all the destructive power of conkers. But, as this macho war wank from Roland Emmerich argues, the US had one thing in its favour: its men. All the most enormous, jutting, chiselled chins in Hollywood are called up to do their duty, and armed with lines of dialogue that sink like depth charges. In fairness, the screenplay, by Wes Tooke, was never intended to be the main attraction here; the priorities in this account of the Battle of Midway are the admittedly impressive aerial battle sequences, featuring numerous gut-churning plunges as the US pilots dive-bomb the enemy ships. British actor Ed Skrein stars as the most reckless of all the flyboys, Dick Best; Woody Harrelson dons a silver wig and an expression of noble fortitude as Admiral Chester Nimitz. Every tired war movie cliche is unearthed in a film that brings nothing new but will no doubt please fans of men in uniform yelling at explosions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
