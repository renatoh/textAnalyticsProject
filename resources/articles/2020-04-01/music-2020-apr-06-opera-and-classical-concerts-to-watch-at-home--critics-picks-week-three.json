Yet even if all too brief, they can fire the aural imagination of a musical child, or indeed adult. A big plus instead was then finding Knussen\u2019s precise and vividly conjured soundworld in the Ensemble Intercontemporain\u2019s performance of Songs for Sue. Claire Booth was the soloist at its 2006 premiere: here again, her clear soprano and expressive way with words are moving. What Knussen called its \u201cautumnal tone\u201d stands \u2013 or so it seems now \u2013 not only as requiem for his wife Sue, but for him too. Visually, the care and insight of the direction serves to open up the score. The many excellent recordings by the same Ensemble Intercontemporain team are similarly attractive finds. That of Edgard Var\u00e8se\u2019s Ecuatorial also combines aural and visual impact, this setting of a Spanish translation of the Mayan civilisation\u2019s sacred Popol Vuh text a visceral and compelling tribute to a long-lost world. Rian Evans The Tale of Tsar Saltan (La Monnaie, Brussels) The Russian repertory always seems to bring out the best in director Dmitri Tcherniakov. He has made Rimsky-Korsakov\u2019s operas a particular speciality, and this production of Tsar Saltan seems to me the finest of his Rimsky stagings so far \u2013 a brilliant reimagining of a work that can be easily undermined by the creaky dramaturgy of the libretto. Tcherniakov gives the fairytale plot a contemporary frame, which allows him to bring sense to the fantastical elements, played out in cartoon-like costumes referencing 1905 illustrations of Pushkin\u2019s source poem, and also makes the end of the work genuinely moving. The action on stage is complemented by animated sequences, which are at their most virtuosic during the Flight of the Bumble Bee interlude; the way in which the two elements are seamlessly integrated is an impressive achievement in itself. And then there\u2019s Rimsky\u2019s lustrous music, which positively glows under conductor Alain Altinoglu, and a superb cast, in which Svetlana Aksenova as Militrisa, and Bogdan Volkov as her son Gvidon are exceptional. Surtitles are only in French or Flemish \u2013 try this synopsis for a quick plot overview. Also available on YouTube. Andrew Clements Syzygy Ensemble: Dare to Hope If now isn\u2019t the time to explore concerts online that you couldn\u2019t ever have attended physically, I don\u2019t know when is. The Syzygy Ensemble are one of Australia\u2019s top new music outfits and their recent performance at the decade-old Melbourne Recital Centre is beguiling, ear-bending stuff. There are works here rarely heard in the UK \u2013 New Zealander John Psathas\u2019s Island Songs, for instance. It\u2019s largely driven by nervous energy, but the jazz-inflected middle movement suddenly falls still, plucked cello notes echoed by bright piano chimes and dusky shadows from the clarinet. The highlight, though, is Australian Caerwen Martin\u2019s The Beauty of Now, played with enormous sensitivity by Laila Engle (flutes) and pianist Leigh Harrold. It\u2019s irresistibly spacious and resolutely slow to unfold. The filming is a no-nonsense single angle and the sound is so close-miked you can hear the musicians breathing and practically feel the grip of rosined bows on strings: a tad unforgiving of fleeting imperfections, but ideal for anyone missing the thrill of live performance. Flora Willson Don Giovanni (Finnish National Opera) Jussi Nikkil\u00e4\u2019s Finnish National Opera staging of Mozart\u2019s Don Giovanni earlier this year is essentially a portrait of an immoralist on the skids. It\u2019s an unnerving, bleakly funny interpretation that charts the gradual descent of Tuomas Pursio\u2019s charismatic, bisexual Don from self-assured sensuality into the drug-fuelled hallucinatory hell that is the outcome of his excess. Nikkil\u00e4 takes occasional liberties with Mozart\u2019s narrative and regrettably cuts the final sextet, and his ambiguous imagery can be both erotic and disturbing. Hanna Rantala\u2019s Anna has become both the Don\u2019s consensual partner and a witness to her father\u2019s murder, while Markus Suikhonen\u2019s exhibitionist Leporello has the list of his master\u2019s conquests tattooed across his body. Patrick Fournillier\u2019s conducting is all fiery exhilaration, and ensemble values are high, with the best performances coming from Suikhonen (outstanding), Tamuna Gochashvili\u2019s tellingly manipulative Elvira and Tuomas Katajala\u2019s elegant, principled Ottavio. It\u2019s dark, edgy stuff and remarkably compelling. Tim Ashley Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra: Emily Beynon Portrait As well as a mouthwatering selection of performances under conductors such as Bernard Haitink, Ivan Fischer, Andris Nelsons and Mariss Jansons (though none, curiously, involving its music director of the 1990s, Riccardo Chailly), the website of Amsterdam\u2019s great orchestra also features chamber performances from some of its members. The programme devised by principal flute Emily Beynon, with her cellist colleague from the orchestra Honorine Schaeffer and pianist Andrew West, is particularly interesting. Its mix of French and Czech music was inspired by the art nouveau painter Alphonse Mucha, who worked in both Prague and Paris: he befriended the young Jan\u00e1\u010dek while his journalist son, Ji\u0159\u00ed, became a friend of Martin\u016f. Beynon plays her own flute-and-piano arrangements of Debussy\u2019s Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l\u2019Apr\u00e8s-Midi and Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s Violin Sonata, as well as a rather French-sounding piece by Geraldine Mucha, Ji\u0159\u00ed\u2019s Scottish-born wife. Schaeffer and West also contribute Faur\u00e9\u2019s second cello sonata, before the recital ends with Martin\u016f\u2019s Trio for flute, cello and piano; it\u2019s a feast of top-quality instrumental playing.
