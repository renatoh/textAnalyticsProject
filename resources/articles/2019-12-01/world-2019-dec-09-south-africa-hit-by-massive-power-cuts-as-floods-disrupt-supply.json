The state-owned utility Eskom said on Monday that it could only meet 80% of the country\u2019s energy demand and called for a \u201cconcerted collective effort\u201d after about a quarter of its generation capacity failed. The failure to provide adequate power for what has long been seen as Africa\u2019s most developed economy will underline the huge challenges faced by the president, Cyril Ramaphosa, as he attempts to turn round flagging growth rates and bring in much-needed reforms. South Africa is struggling with soaring unemployment, high rates of violent crime and patchy delivery of basic services. Many blame incompetence and graft under the previous president, Jacob Zuma. Power cuts earlier this year pushed the country close to recession. The most recent outages, the worst for more than a decade, started five days ago and have intensified over the last 36 hours. They are predicted to continue throughout the week. Eskom said on Monday morning: \u201cWith the incessant rains, we are beginning to experience flooding at some power stations, which have further led to load losses and has impacted supply as the rainy weather persists \u2026 Load shedding is a responsible act and highly controlled process, implemented to protect the country from a national blackout.\u201d Environmentalists and experts have criticised a new energy plan which maintained a central role for coal-fired power generation. Executives have blamed a failure to maintain the power infrastructure. Two massive new coal power stations have been crippled by a series of technical problems. The utility owes about 450bn rand (\u00a323bn) and has been described as \u201cthe biggest challenge facing the country\u201d by analysts. \u201cMess up Eskom, and you mess up the country. And it looks as though key players are doing just that,\u201d wrote Mark Swilling, an expert in sustainable development at Stellenbosch University, on The Conversation website. Ramaphosa took power last year and pledged to overcome South Africa\u2019s \u201chuge and real\u201d problems. The former labour activist turned tycoon won an election in May but faces entrenched networks of patronage and corruption, some within the ruling African National Congress party, as well as widespread political opposition to his reforms. In a further blow to public finances and business confidence, South African Airways, the publicly owned national carrier, has been put into \u201cbusiness rescue\u201d. SAA has been posting losses since 2011 and is deeply in debt. It has received more than 20bn rand in government bailouts over the past three years, which has achieved little more than keeping it barely afloat. In a statement, Ramaphosa said although many of the state-owned firms such as Eskom and SAA were deeply in debt, they remained valuable state assets with immense capacity. \u201cWe will not allow any of these strategic entities to fail. Rather, we need to take all necessary steps \u2013 even drastic ones \u2013 to restore them to health,\u201d he said. Ramaphosa\u2019s description of one troubled power station as a \u201cfitting symbol of the importance of our state-owned enterprises\u201d prompted an angry response from commentators and social media."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
