Kevan Jones, the veterans' minister, issued a statement after being named by bloggers as the person briefing against Dannatt, who has embarrassed the government by speaking bluntly about the need for more equipment \u2013 particularly helicopters \u2013 for British troops in Afghanistan. Suspicion fell on Jones when it emerged that one unnamed defence minister recently described Dannatt as a \"complete bastard\". There have also been reports that Freedom of Information (FoI) requests were submitted on behalf of Labour MPs to find out how much public money had been spent entertaining guests at Dannatt's official residence in Kensington Palace. Jones hit back last night, saying: \"It is obviously the 'silly season' in the blogosphere. General Dannatt and I have worked very closely on a number of personnel-related issues, because we both care deeply about servicemen and women. I look forward to continuing my working relationship with General Dannatt, both now as chief of the general staff and beyond into his retirement.\" A Ministry of Defence spokesman added: \"MoD ministers are not involved in a plot to smear General Dannatt. Any suggestion that they are is nonsense. At such an important time for the mission in Afghanistan, everyone at the top of the MoD is focused on the task in hand.\" Despite official statements, the government has been irritated by Dannatt's highly public criticism of it, giving the damaging impression of disunity at a difficult moment in the Afghanistan war. \"Too right I am waging some kind of campaign,\" the general said this week. \"I am waging some kind of campaign within the MoD and within government to make sure that our people on the front line carrying out difficult and dangerous operations on behalf of the nation have got the right level of manpower and have got the right amount of equipment.\" In his latest intervention Dannatt, 58, who is due to leave his post later this month, said the government needed to provide more equipment so that British troops could have permanent 24/7 surveillance to target the Taliban as they planted roadside bombs, which are exacting such a deadly toll. Twenty two personnel lost their lives last month in the deadliest month for British troops since the overthrow of the Taliban in November 2001. The increase in casualties is feeding concerns in Whitehall that the government is struggling to shore up public support for the military campaign. The Conservatives have seized on the rift between the government and the military. Liam Fox, the shadow defence secretary said: \"Labour has now become the government of fear and smear. Whilst suppressing reports of their own incompetence, they attempt to undermine the reputation of one of our most distinguished generals.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
