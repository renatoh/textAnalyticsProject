The video, released on the home affairs minister\u2019s Facebook page, is authorised by Dutton on behalf of the Liberal National party and consists of an interview with AFP Canberra airport police commander Simon Henry and images of the AFP commissioner, Reece Kershaw, and others at a press conference announcing the policy. A Labor spokesperson has called on Dutton to explain if it is \u201cacceptable for him to use AFP officers in his personally authorised videos on social media\u201d and questioned whether they might feel \u201cused for political purposes\u201d. On 6 December Dutton and the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced that 135 police and protective service officers would be stationed at airports in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and the Gold Coast in 2020, followed by, Cairns, Adelaide and Darwin Airports in 2021. The officers will be armed with Mk18 short-barrel rifles. In the video, Dutton boasts of the $107m commitment \u2013 for which funding was allocated in the 2018 budget \u2013 promising Australians will see \u201cspecialist squads of police\u201d at airports and \u201ca greater presence of canines [dogs] with the capacity to detect explosive devices, bombs, et cetera\u201d. \u201cSo Australians \u2013 I really want to say \u2013 you should be reassured by the presence of these officers and know we\u2019re doing everything possible to keep people safe at our airports this Christmas but all through the year.\u201d Dutton then prompts superintendent Henry to explain the trial at Canberra airport, which he describes as an \u201cexcellent capability\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019re right, it should reassure the members of the public who are travelling that we have a safe, secure aviation industry,\u201d Henry said. \u201cAnd it gives us the ability to also deter incidents from happening in the first place but if something does happen we have a much greater capability to respond to it.\u201d The video features at least five other unnamed officers who posed with the minister while they held the rifles and dogs on leads at the Canberra airport press conference. Electoral law requires political material to be authorised where it is made \u201cfor the dominant purpose of influencing the way electors vote in a federal election\u201d \u2013 regardless of whether it is aired outside the election period. A Labor spokesperson said the opposition \u201csupports the AFP\u2019s hard work and sacrifice as well as these new measures to keep Australians safe at airports\u201d. \u201cIt is completely acceptable for the AFP to appear with relevant ministers at announcements, however Peter Dutton must ensure that AFP officers are never put in a position where they might feel they are being used for political purposes.\u201d An AFP spokesman said all officers at the event \u201cwere aware they would be filmed for material for traditional and social media\u201d. \u201cMembers have not breached the AFP code of conduct through their involvement in this event,\u201d he said. In March the Australian Federal Police Association \u2013 the union representing police \u2013 warned the AFP is losing its independence and integrity and must be separated from Dutton\u2019s Home Affairs portfolio. Police independence from the political process has been called into question during raids of construction union headquarters in 2015, the office of former senator Stephen Conroy in 2016, and the Australian Workers Union headquarters investigating historic political donations in 2017.
