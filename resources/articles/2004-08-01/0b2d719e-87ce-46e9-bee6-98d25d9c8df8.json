The Edinburgh rider, twice kilometre world champion, sped up to pass the bus on a curve but his wheel slipped and he fell. He is not seriously hurt but he did suffer minor scrapes on his elbow, hip and thigh. \"I am fine,\" he said. \"I was lucky not break something. A stupid fall could have destroyed my tournament.\" \u00b7 Britain's hopes of success on the cycling track could be affected if the wind continues to blow in Athens. The high winds could be serious for the cycling, which begins on Friday, because of the design of the velodrome. The track is open at the sides and turbulence and dust on the track could dramatically affect performances and make crashes more likely. The British team have invested in high- performance \"disc\" wheels which they may not get to use because of the wind. Rob Hayles, who will compete in the team pursuit squad, the individual pursuit and the madison, trained on the track yesterday. \"We've got five spoke wheels in the front, just because of the wind, but even then on the back straight it was fairly dodgy,\" Hayles said. \u00b7Richard Faulds will defend the double trap title he won in Sydney under the added pressure that he is Britain's last hope of a shooting medal here after Sarah Gibbins failed to reach the final in the trap. The 34-year-old, Britain's only woman shooter, finished three rounds of qualifying at a blustery Markopoulo shooting range having hit 58 of 75 targets - a score which put her two shots away from the top six and a place in yesterday's final.\"It was not a constant wind, it was very gusty. I have never shot in conditions as ferocious as this,\" she said. \u00b7Two of Britain's rowing medal hopes were affected by the weather yesterday, as strong winds caused the postponement of all racing. Cath Bishop and Katherine Grainger had been due to take part in the coxless pairs repechage after finishing second in their heat on Saturday. \u00b7The weightlifter Kamran Panjavi had to retire from the 62kg event after pulling a muscle during his second lift of the competition in Athens. Panjavi was stretchered off the platform at the Nikaia Olympic weightlifting hall. He is now back in the Olympic Village receiving treatment from the Team GB medical team."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
