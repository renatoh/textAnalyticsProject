Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, the US government\u2019s top ally in Central America, is under increasing pressure amid public anger over crumbling public services, dismal approval ratings \u2013 and explosive revelations that he was the subject of a US Drug Enforcement Administration trafficking investigation during his first term in office. The US supported his re-election in 2017, since when the number of migrants and asylum seekers fleeing Honduras has soared. The current wave of social unrest was triggered by privatization reforms that critics warned would kill off public education and health services. This week, Hern\u00e1ndez withdrew the proposed legislation, but more strikes and protests are planned for the coming days despite the militarized crackdown. \u201cThe people are on the streets because the crisis is extreme, and they have been betrayed too many times by this government, which is no longer recognized as credible or legitimate,\u201d said Dr Suyapa Figueroa, president of the Honduras Medical College and leader of the fledgling Platform for the Defense of Education and Health. \u201cWe are willing to dialogue but only with representatives who are honest, knowledgable, and have no conflicts of interest, not those chosen by this illegal government,\u201d Figueroa added. Teachers and doctors first went on strike in April after the government approved legislative decrees granting special powers to ministers to impose major reforms to the health and education systems. But the roots of the unrest go much deeper. Education and healthcare have suffered severe cuts and multiple corruption scandals under the National party, which has ruled Honduras since a military-backed coup deposed the elected president, Manual Zelaya, in 2009. Spending on education and culture has dropped from 32.9% of the central government budget to 19.9% over the past decade, with a de facto freeze on wages and infrastructure spending. Marco Calder\u00f3n, 28, a primary school teacher in the country\u2019s industrial hub, San Pedro Sula, was among hundreds manning a roadblock this week. \u201cThe constitution establishes the right to free education, but we depend more on parents than we do on the state,\u201d he said. In 2016, asbestos was detected seeping from his school\u2019s roof, but requests for funding to replace it were turned down by central and local authorities. Instead, the teachers and parents raised $1,500 through fundraising events and collection tins at traffic lights to pay for repairs. \u201cWe have no library, no computer classes, no English teacher; I\u2019m fighting so these children can have better future,\u201d he said. The public health service is also close to collapse, with widespread shortages of medicines, staff, beds, cribs and equipment. About 40% of emergency rooms have inadequate medical cover, according to the National Commission for Human Rights. Less than 10% of this year\u2019s central government budget is allocated to health, compared with 14.3% in 2010. A previous wave of protests erupted in 2015 when it was revealed that at least $350m was stolen from the state run health insurance system, (IHSS) \u2013 some of which ended up in Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s 2013 election campaign coffers. San Pedro Sula\u2019s public maternity clinic has cancelled regular appointments due to staff shortages, offering only emergency services. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough bandages, gauze, supplements or doctors,\u201d said Sam Lu\u00eds, a fifth-year medical student. \u201cFor too long, the focus has been on security, when it should be health and education.\u201d Honduras\u2019s security and defence budget increased from 12.5% to 14.5% in the past decade, but Honduras remains one of the most dangerous countries in the world outside an official war zone, with 31 massacres (three or more murders) registered in the first five months of 2019 \u2013 compared to 39 in all of 2018. \u201cThe IMF and World Bank demand efficiencies in the public sector, but, an illegitimate government linked with corruption and drug trafficking cannot transform the health and education sectors by force,\u201d said economist Hugo No\u00e9 Pino, a former economic minster and ex-governor of the Central Bank. Last week US prosecutors unsealed court documents from 2015 which name Hern\u00e1ndez as a target of a major investigation into \u201clarge-scale drug-trafficking and money laundering activities\u201d. The court filings also named several close confidants, including his deceased sister, Hilda Hern\u00e1ndez, a former National party president linked to an IHSS fraud, and the security minister, Gen Juli\u00e1n Pacheco. The president\u2019s younger brother and former congressman, Tony Hern\u00e1ndez, was arrested in the US last November and charged with conspiring to traffic tons of cocaine stamped with his initials into the US between 2004 and 2016. President Hern\u00e1ndez released a statement denying any wrongdoing and said he enjoyed a good relationship with the DEA. There is no indication that charges were brought, nor that the investigation remains open. But the revelations fuelled further anger on the streets, which was met with state force condemned as excessive by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights\u2019 office and Amnesty International. The US embassy in Tegucigalpa did not comment on the DEA investigation, but called for calm and dialogue. The following day, after protesters set fire to a door at the embassy US officials cancelled all visa appointments for this week, and reiterated praise for the government\u2019s contribution to combatting drug trafficking. \u201cDespite the evidence, despite popular opinion, the US embassy continues to back Hern\u00e1ndez,\u201d said the sociologist Eugenio Sosa. \u201cBut what we see on the streets is widespread indignation, rejection and hate for a president who they consider illegal, illegitimate and corrupt. The people want the president gone.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
