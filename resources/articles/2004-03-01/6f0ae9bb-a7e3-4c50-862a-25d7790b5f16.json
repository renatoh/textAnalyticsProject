The Association of Colleges says that the government's commitment to higher education means that there could be little left for them. Julian Gravatt, the director of funding and development at the AoC, told EducationGuardian.co.uk: \"We're not particularly in the business of kicking universities but I think it's important to put into perspective their case in the context of others.\" In a paper produced ahead of tomorrow's budget and the forthcoming comprehensive spending review, the AoC says that universities stand to gain more than \u00a32bn from the higher education bill, which includes top-up fees, despite the fact that the sector has \u00a314bn worth of assets. The paper argues that to tackle the social gap in education, more students need to get level three qualifications. The AoC has bid \u00a31.9bn for the next spending round, which, it claims, in the document, is an \"affordable, reasonable and sensible bid\". At the end of last year the AoC was warning that up to 70,000 adult learning places could be cut as the budgets come under pressure. Now they are warning that basic skills places are being squeezed as college budgets come under even more pressure. One college principal and member told the AoC that the problem was \"a gradual attrition of provision\". Mr Gravatt said that the government's financial commitments to widening participation would be better spent on making sure that all pupils were academically equipped to go to university. \"There is an on-running issue about whether the education budget is enough. Having accepted it is what it is, then you have to think about how to carve it up. The 50% HE target will carve up a lot. But to have the fairest provision we need to target on level three. \"There is potentially a financial barrier but for a wider number it's about getting the education to go to university - 92% of students with two A-levels go to university,\" he added. Tomorrow's budget is expected to reveal an extension of the Education Maintenance Allowance scheme which encourages pupils to stay in education post aged-16 by offering them \u00a340 worth of means-tested grants."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
