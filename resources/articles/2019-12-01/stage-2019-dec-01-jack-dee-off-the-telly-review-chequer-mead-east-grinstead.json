Grumpy was always Dee\u2019s best tune, and the record isn\u2019t changing in Off the Telly, his first standup tour for seven years. Charity fundraisers, secondhand shops, electric cars, smashed avocado: you name it, Dee\u2019s teed off about it, sometimes to a sublime degree. But the returns diminish, in a two-hour show that has nothing to add (narratively, structurally, thematically) to Dee\u2019s one gripe after another. It\u2019s a pleasant jolt when he produces a mandolin for his encore, and sings a silly song about paracetamol. Oh, for more of those flavours earlier in the show! But if proceedings can hitherto feel monotonous, there remain some fine jokes. The one about the government\u2019s advice on alcohol consumption is very droll, and I loved the image of Dee brandishing a curtain rod and chasing people with stretched-ear jewellery. That routine is characteristic: like many comics of a certain age, the 58-year-old turns fuddy-duddy fire on how we live now. There\u2019s a fine riff on \u201cthe artisan movement\u201d, in which Dee scales peak pissed-off while imagining a supermarket that treats its customers like veggie delivery firm Abel &amp; Cole. Less rewarding is the routine mocking Extinction Rebellion and Greta Thunberg, which elicits rogue cheers among the crowd. \u201cIt won\u2019t be your problem, you old git,\u201d comes one heckle. Dee lets the cheers go unchallenged, but shuts the heckler down. A bad smell lingers. Blanket cynicism only works if it\u2019s obviously a caricature. As a real-life personality trait, it\u2019s depressing. But Dee just about pitches it right. He\u2019s often audaciously cruel to his crowd, and there\u2019s a choice sendup of his boorish manner when he hypothesises a delinquent guest turn on Celebrity Bake Off. There\u2019s domestic material, too, about empty nest syndrome, which he\u2019s enjoying. And political mimicry: Donald Tusk as a Bond villain and Theresa May\u2019s posture memorably burlesqued. It\u2019s a rare expressive, capering moment in a show that defaults to surly. Huntingdon Hall, Worcester, 6 December; Savoy Theatre, Monmouth, 7 December; then touring. This review was amended on 2 December to correct the spelling of avocado."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
