Depending on your point of view, he is either a maverick genius or an irresponsible ego-maniac. So much has been written about the millionaire broadcaster turned media mogul turned producer, he has become one of those rare celebrities whose myth precedes the reality. The view of the one man who mattered today, Mr Justice Lightman, undoubtedly erred towards the latter. Branding Evans a \"petulant prima donna\" the judge presiding over the high court case handed down a judgment that amounted to a full-scale character assassination, while throwing out his claim for \u00a38.6m in unpaid share options and ruling that Virgin Radio was right to sack him for going on an 18-hour drinking binge rather than presenting the show. \"To achieve what he wants without confrontation, he is manipulative and has resort to any means, fair or foul, to achieve his ends,\" the judge said of the former DJ, adding that Virgin management had dealt with the situation as best it could. Those close to Evans today said he was sanguine about the verdict but surprised by the vitriol of the judge's attack. Yet many are now wondering aloud whether the judge's damning verdict could spell the beginning of the end for Evans and reflect a wider shift in public taste. It's interesting to note that many of the qualities the judge accused him of, particularly his controlling, maverick nature, were the very things that propelled his rise to the top in the first place. In the past Evans has always seemed to come up smelling, if not of roses, then certainly of money and success. Cast your mind back to the five-year period between 1995 and 2000 when everything he touched turned as golden as his hair. Evans was at the epicentre of so-called \"Cool Britannia\". Oasis were top of the charts with Liam Gallagher sneering from every speaker in the land, Damien Hirst was leading a new wave of British art, Loaded was flying off the shelves and Euro '96 had made \"Three Lions\" the new national anthem. Talent, arrogance, success and copious wealth were in and Evans embraced them all with reckless abandon. Having risen to prominence through innovative and popular stints on Piccadilly Radio in Manchester and GLR in London he went from strength to strength. From Big Breakfast to Don't Forget Your Toothbrush and TFI Friday to his record signing as Radio 1 breakfast show presenter, it seemed he could do no wrong. But it wasn't just his broadcasting prowess that attracted admiration, envy and derision in equal measure but his business acumen too. This is the man, remember, who graduated from flogging sweets in the playground to undercut his school tuck shop to making a 3,650% return on his investment on Virgin Radio when he sold it to SMG for \u00a3225m in January 2000. Even then, though, there were traces of the man described today by Justice Lightman as someone who was \"given to extremes\" and who, despite his \"confident front\", was \"very insecure in himself\". In those days this manifested itself in a workaholic desire to cram in as much as possible and his need to surround himself with sycophantic admirers. Amateur psychologists and unauthorised biographers are fond of linking his behaviour to his formative experiences of being bullied on the Manchester estate where he grew up. But there's also a more universal reason behind his attitude - the worse he behaved, the more he got away with it and the bigger the headlines and the better the ratings. Many within the industry are now wondering whether today's court judgment could spell the beginning of the end for Evans. His much-heralded return to television earlier this year has been a disaster. Boys and Girls, a shameless rehash of Don't Forget Your Toothbrush for Channel 4, will not be coming back after audiences dipped as low as 1.2 million in its prime time Saturday night slot. Live With..., the Channel 5 teatime show not a million miles removed from his own TFI Friday, has seen Evans fall out with both its presenters who, like him, were Radio DJs known for their controversial broadcasting style. Both Chris Moyles and Christian O'Connell have publicly kept their mouths shut but privately say they will never work with him again. To make matters worse, Channel Five is planning to axe the show when it reaches the end of its current run after audiences dipped to less than 200,000. Evans has always been accused of using people and then moving on, having publicly fallen out with almost everyone he's ever worked with. But some are now suggesting that his overbearing, domineering behaviour no longer washes now that he isn't coming up with the goods. In the past Evans could always console himself with the fact that, no matter what criticism was thrown his way, his popularity with listeners and viewers continued unabated. But the rot that set in with his ill-fated attempt to produce the Lulu-fronted lottery show Red Alert for BBC1 in 2000 has continued with a string of shows that have failed to find favour with audiences. ITV's Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly have stolen his populist entertainer crown and the difference between them could not be more marked. The Geordie duo are safe, wholesome and fun for all the family in direct contrast to Evans' unpredictable ways. To many, it seems that Evans is still stuck in his mid-1990s salad days and his programmes reflect that. But times have changed. Instead of the boorish arrogance of Oasis, it is now sensitive Coldplay who are in vogue. When in 1996 Gazza was the toast of Wembley for scoring a wonder goal despite his notoriously boozy ways, today teetotal family man David Beckham dominates the back and front pages. His brief statement today after losing a court case that will cost him millions was typical of his unpredictability and desire to shock. Evans was not there for the verdict but issued a statement saying: \"All will come out right at last, have we such faith in the goodness of providence\" - an apparent reference to the words of the journalist Henry Stanley on the Victorian missionary David Livingstone. Those close to Evans said he \"shrugged off\" the verdict and remained \"chipper\". Even a legal bill for a few million pounds won't put much of a dent in his fortune. But the consequences for his career run much deeper. His friend and drinking partner Paul Gascoigne squandered his tremendous natural talent on the football pitch and ended up washed up at a Chinese second division club. It remains to be seen whether Evans becomes his equivalent in the entertainment world. \u00b7 This article fist appeared on MediaGuardian.co.uk on June 26 2003."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
