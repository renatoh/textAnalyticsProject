The Roma and other Gypsy/Traveller communities remain uniquely marginalised across Europe, notwithstanding the EU's funding of numerous projects and initiatives. Discriminatory attitudes are prevalent towards the Roma throughout Europe in a way which has made it easy for states to adopt discriminatory legislation and to reject calls for greater integration. These attitudes are not simply concerned with Roma poverty or petty crime, as has been suggested in France and Italy. This is about racism and the construction of useful scapegoats in times of economic and social insecurity. The Roma have been presented as a threat to the fabric of society in France and Italy; the solution has been liquidation of encampments and deportations. The same arguments were used against European Roma 70 years ago to even more disastrous effect, when an estimated 600,000 were exterminated. Yet we should not be too quick to condemn. Our own treatment of Gypsies/Travellers has not been positive, and there are current legislative proposals which further criminalise the travelling lifestyle by introducing a criminal offence of intentional trespass. In 2002 we were \"informed\" that \"waves\" of Roma migrants were arriving in Dover from the Czech Republic and Slovakia. There were many calls for their removal \u2013 and not just from the conservative right. A European strategy is urgently needed where the human rights of Roma are seen as a European priority rather than the responsibility of a handful of economically impoverished east European states. Dr Helen O'Nions Nottingham Trent University \u2022 Thank you for highlighting the expulsion of the Roma in France \u2013 it is deeply upsetting for Holocaust survivors to be reminded of their own sad experiences of being rounded up. We should remember all people, including the Roma and Sinti, who were persecuted because they did not fit \"the norm\". The stages of genocide are well known \u2013 identification, stigmatisation, victimisation, concentration, expulsion. I feel ashamed that we appear to live in a world where the lessons of the past have not been learned. We condemn the actions of the French government.
