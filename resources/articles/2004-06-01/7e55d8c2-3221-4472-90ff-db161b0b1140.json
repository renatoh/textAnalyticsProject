There's no nervousness, no negativity. It's all about: 'we're going to play this game, we're going to beat them and then we're into the semi-finals'. Our spirit of togetherness has never been better.\" Beckham is proving to be an accomplished tub-thumper but the England captain is entitled to bask in the general sense of well-being, particularly when compared with some of the political infighting that has afflicted some of the other teams. Unlike the Portuguese camp, where there have been divisions between some of the older hands and the younger players, the cliques that once scarred England squads comprising the different sets of Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool players appear to have been consigned to the past. There have been few hostile headlines, hardly a hint of controversy and, unlike the days of Glenn Hoddle and Kevin Keegan, Beckham has not heard anybody complaining about Sven-Goran Eriksson's tactics or selections, mostly because the players appreciate he has used his best team in every game. Nobody has called Eriksson a \"blind man\", as the former Croatia coach Miroslav Blazevic sniped about Otto Baric, or poured scorn on his tactics as the increasingly self-centred Ruud van Nistelrooy has done about the Dutch coach Dick Advocaat. The feel-good factor is not contrived for the benefit of the press. England were over-awed, heavy-legged and under-whelming when they faced Brazil at this stage in the World Cup two years ago but, free of injuries and genuinely brimming with self-belief, Beckham reflected there could be \"no excuses\" should they fail to become the first team in the last four of the tournament tonight. \"Around the hotel the players are walking round with such confidence. We really believe we can compete with the very best,\" he said. \"Sometimes in the past there has been a bit of negativity in the squad - but not one player is worried right now, regardless of whichever match we're going into. \"In the past there have been players maybe talking about the other teams more than about ourselves but that has not been the case here. We know this is a great chance for us and what there is for us if we can get through this game.\" Steven Gerrard corroborated this by reiterating his feeling that England \"can go all the way\" and, amid the general optimism, it felt slightly impudent to point out to Beckham that in one website poll 38% of England fans wanted him to be dropped. He clearly believes some of the criticism has been unjustified but he is a sturdy enough character to cope. \"Scoring important goals, taking good free-kicks, that's what I've been about for the last 10 years so when I don't do it people are bound to ask questions of me. The important thing for me is to wake up in the morning, look in the mirror and know that I have given 100%.\" Beckham-watchers will have noted that the Real Madrid midfielder has been playing a slightly different role than he is used to, either at the Bernabeu or before that at Manchester United. \"I have been sitting a lot deeper. Our three other midfielders are all very attack-minded so if that means me sitting back and taking more responsibility on a defensive side, something I've not really had to do in recent years, I will do that even if it means sacrificing some of the other things I can do. So far it has worked for the team so I will carry on.\" More defensive work will be necessary to counter the threat of Cristiano Ronaldo, Beckham's successor in Old Trafford's coveted No7 shirt, but it is his Madrid team-mate Luis Figo whom he fears most. \"He just has this great aura. Style. It being his last competition, he's determined to go out on a high and you could see that against Spain - he put everything into the match. He has an arrogance about him that he's ready to play against anyone and he doesn't mind who.\" Portents - beware years ending in four \u00b7 On the six occasions that England have played Portugal in Lisbon they have never lost, winning three and drawing three. Furthermore, Portugal have only defeated England once on home soil. \u00b7 England have only once beaten the hosts of a major tournament. However, that victory was almost 50 years ago to the day, on June 20 1954, when Walter Winterbottom's side beat Switzerland 2-0 in the World Cup. \u00b7 The last time tonight's referee Urs Meier was in charge of a match involving the hosts of a tournament (South Korea in the 2002 World Cup) they were defeated1-0 by Germany. But he did award the penalty to Romania that led to England's exit from Euro 2000. \u00b7 Portugal supporters may take hope from the fact that on the two previous occasions that the European Championship was held in a year ending in four, the host nation were the eventual winners: when Spain defeated the USSR in 1964 and when France beat Spain in 1984. \u00b7 When England won the 1966 World Cup Chris Farlowe was at No1 with Out of Time; when England won the 2003 Rugby World Cup REM were No2 in the album chart with In Time; at the moment Britney Spears is No1 in the singles chart with Everytime."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
