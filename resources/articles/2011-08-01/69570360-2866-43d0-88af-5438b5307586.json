A group of Florentine intellectuals called the Camerata decided to recreate the original form of Greek drama \u2013 which they wrongly believed to have been sung throughout \u2013 and one of them, Jacopo Peri, accordingly composed Dafne (1597). The baroque period (c1600-1750) The Camerata's successful experiment led to follow-ups, often performed at Italian courts for the entertainment of guests. The most famous example is L'Orfeo by Monteverdi (1567-1643, pictured right), which is often regarded as opera's first masterpiece. Greek myths continued to provide the subject matter as opera spread throughout Italy. Opera moved into the public sphere in 1637 when the first opera house opened in Venice, soon sparking rival operations. The classical period (c1750-1800) Two developments ended the hegemony of serious opera (opera seria). The first was the posthumous success of Pergolesi's 1733 subversive Neapolitan comedy, La Serva Padrona, in which a maid outwits and marries her master. Comedies (opera buffa) such as this made opera seria look marmoreal. The second arose from a desire to rationalise opera along Enlightenment lines. Simplicity and naturalism were the watchwords of Gluck (1714-1787), whose L'Orfeo ed Euridice (1762) and Alceste (1767, pictured left) provided the benchmarks for such \"reform\" works, focusing on dramatic truth. At the end of the 18th century, Mozart (1756-1791) drew on these traditions in a sequence of comedies (Nozze di Figaro, 1786, Don Giovanni, 1787, and Cos\u00ec fan Tutte, 1790), as well as renewing opera seria (Idomeneo, 1781, and La Clemenza di Tito, 1791), and giving a boost to opera in the German (as opposed to Italian) language (Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail, 1782 and Die Zauberfl\u00f6te, 1791). The romantic period (c1800-1890) The French Revolution impacted on opera as on everything else. New subjects extolling liberty became popular in the works of the Paris-based Italian Luigi Cherubini, the contemporary most admired by Beethoven. As the 19th century progressed, Italian composers Rossini (pictured right), Donizetti and Bellini continued to compose lyrical scores \u2013 their writing privileged the expressive power of the human voice in what has become known as the bel canto (beautiful singing) style. Verdi dominated the next generation. Over five decades he demonstrated a vigorous commitment to drama in Rigoletto (1851), Il Trovatore and La Traviata (both 1855), gradually honing his technical skills to perfection in Otello (1887) and Falstaff (1893). In Germany, Weber instigated opera's Romantic phase with his gothic-horror tale Der Freisch\u00fctz (The Marksman, 1821); its impact was wide, not least on Wagner, whose reimagining of the potential of opera would prove revolutionary. His sequence of large-scale, mainly mythological operas, climaxing in the four-evening-long Der Ring des Nibelungen (1876) and Parsifal (1882) are among man's most ambitious artistic works. Meanwhile, other national traditions arose, each with a distinct identity. The Russians, led by Glinka, Mussorgsky and Tchaikovsky, concentrated on history or the fairy tale; the Czechs, led by Smetana, Dvor\u02c7 \u00e1k and Jan\u00e1 c\u02c7 ek, on comedy, fairy tale and later realism. France preferred the grand historical epics of Meyerbeer and the more intimate moral fables of Gounod and Massenet. Verismo (c1890-1920) At the end of the 19th century, Italian opera renewed itself under the battle-cry of verismo, adopting a realistic approach to subject matter and treatment: Puccini (1858-1924) represented this tradition at its most diverse and accomplished, producing works such as La Boh\u00e8me (1896), Tosca (1900, pictured right), and Madama Butterfly (1904), whose popularity remains undiminished. Developments in the 20th century In Germany, Richard Strauss at first followed in Wagner's path, later showing greater independence with his modernist Salome (1905) and Elektra (1909), both chiming with Freud's contemporary psychological discoveries. Alban Berg would go even further in this direction with Wozzeck (1925) and Lulu (1937), though Strauss himself diverted into comedy with Der Rosenkavalier (1911) and the complex theatrical conceits of Ariadne auf Naxos (1912, pictured right) and Capriccio (1942). In the post-war era Karlheinz Stockhausen surprised everyone by creating an enormous cycle of seven operas called Licht, still yet to be staged complete. Opera appeared to have faltered in Italy and, with notable exceptions by Poulenc and Messiaen, in France. But it once more took off in Britain with Britten's triumph with Peter Grimes in 1945, which marked the inauguration of another major career that spurred on such contemporaries and successors as Michael Tippett, William Walton and Harrison Birtwistle. Contemporary opera Though the US had already produced individual works of distinction (such as Gershwin's Porgy and Bess, 1935, pictured right) it was the arrival of John Adams's Nixon in China in 1987 that marked the emergence of the so-called CNN opera, based on recent historical events, and followed up in The Death of Klinghoffer (1991) and Dr Atomic (2005); such works have demonstrated an immediate contemporary relevance in a form some modernists had declared moribund. Philip Glass's more determinedly minimalist approach was seen in works such as Satyagraha (1980) and Akhnaten (1984), whose appeal is widespread though far from universal. Pop composers, too, began to interest themselves in exploring the relationship between music and drama, such as Damon Albarn's Doctor Dee, which premiered this year. More traditional approaches have found new exponents in the prolific Hans Werner Henze, Pascal Dusapin, Wolfgang Rihm, Thomas Ad\u00e8s, Mark-Anthony Turnage and Judith Weir."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
