In a statement released late on Tuesday night, the union, which represents more than 600,000 workers and has more than 80 members among MPs, blamed ill health for his sudden departure. \u201cTim has unfortunately been suffering with ill health for some time now and has made the difficult decision to stand down from his role, that he does not feel able to continue, in leading our union going forward,\u201d it said. However, some union sources suggested Roache\u2019s departure followed a clash with senior GMB officials over allegations relating to his personal conduct. The statement continued: \u201cA meeting with the finance and general purposes committee will be convened to discuss the resignation and further updates will follow.\u201d The GMB backed Lisa Nandy in Labour\u2019s recent leadership contest, helping her to secure a place on the final ballot paper, and Angela Rayner for deputy leader. The union holds two seats on Labour\u2019s ruling national executive committee. Roache is a GMB lifer, having started in the union\u2019s postroom in 1979, and rising to be its general secretary in 2015 \u2013 being regarded at the time as from the leftwing of the Labour movement. He was re-elected last November with 61% of the vote. During Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, the GMB was sometimes regarded as a more moderate voice than Unite, whose general secretary, Len McCluskey, was an outspoken backer of Corbyn. Roache spoke out about the party\u2019s handling of antisemitism in 2018, saying he had been shocked by some of the examples he had seen. \u201cAntisemitism is a problem in the Labour party. I\u2019ve been shocked at what I\u2019ve seen on social media,\u201d he said. More recently, he hit back on social media at critics of the GMB\u2019s response to the leaked Labour report, which reproduced dozens of lurid private WhatsApp messages from staff hostile to Corbyn. The GMB branch had called for Labour to protect those named in the report. Replying to claims that this was an attack on the party\u2019s general secretary, Jennie Formby, Roache tweeted: \u201cThe GMB is NOT going for Jennie. FACT.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
