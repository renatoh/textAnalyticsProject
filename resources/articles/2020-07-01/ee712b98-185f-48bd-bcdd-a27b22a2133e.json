His report is one click away. Thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night... Roy Hodgson\u2019s verdict. \u201cThe most difficult thing to take is to play so well yet lose the game. We played really well, and could so easily have been leading. It\u2019s very hard to take, especially as there were a couple of issues that could easily have gone our way but didn\u2019t. Referees, you never see them, they\u2019re miles away. I thought the referee on the field could have given the penalty, the people in the office somewhere in Hounslow decided against it too. The other one is one of those hair-fine decisions that is hard to take. One is used to football without VAR, and when a ball is crossed along the six-yard line and someone slides in and scores, I don\u2019t remember those goals ever being ruled out for offside. I\u2019m bitterly disappointed, because that was something we didn\u2019t deserve.\u201d Peter Walton is currently on BT Sport offering his observations on the two VAR decisions. Here\u2019s a live stream. That\u2019s six defeats in a row for Palace, though when it all comes down, they\u2019ll take heart from their performance tonight. They could so easily have had a couple of goals themselves. But it wasn\u2019t to be. They stay in 14th on 42 points, one place and five points ahead of their great rivals Brighton. So life\u2019s not too bad. A word with United\u2019s goal-scoring hero Marcus Rashford. \u201cEvery game for us now is a big game. Before the Southampton game we were scoring goals for fun, but that was a bit more difficult and so was this one. These type of victories you get a lot out of as a team, because you have to work double hard to get a result. Our patterns of play are positive, it\u2019s what we\u2019re looking to improve on. With VAR you don\u2019t really know what to expect, but you can only react to the decision that\u2019s made. It can be difficult at times for both teams. We\u2019ve just got to go and win every game, so today was good to refocus.\u201d United\u2019s unbeaten run stretches to 19 matches. They weren\u2019t at their best today, but ground out the victory nonetheless. Palace will argue that the crucial decisions went against them ... but United were more clinical and classier in front of goal, and that was the real difference. United stay in fifth, but they\u2019re right on Leicester City\u2019s shoulder, and they\u2019re a hell of a handful going forward. An exciting end to the season coming up! 90 min +11: Pogba thinks about a shot from 25 yards but ponders too long and is closed down. 90 min +10: \u201cI was an early VAR supporter and defender,\u201d begins Mary Waltz. \u201cI also thought Brexit and Trump would lose. I say bin VAR.\u201d 90 min +9: Martial tears down the inside left and enters the box. Dann toe-pokes away. Martial then goes over, asking for a penalty, but the referee waves play on. 90 min +8: Martial dribbles down the left and reaches the byline. He fires towards Lingard at the near post. There\u2019s some pinball, and Sakho is forced to hack off the line. That would have been a farcical goal. 90 min +7: Fernandes whips the free kick towards the bottom left, but only ripples the side netting. 90 min +6: Rashford and Zaha tangle. Rashford grabs Zaha\u2019s leg and refuses to put it down, but is awarded the free kick. Zaha is furious and it nearly kicks off between him and Pogba. The referee calms everything down quickly enough. 90 min +5: Fernandes is named man-of-the-match by Glenn Hoddle on BT Sport. And this on a comparative off-day. A properly transformative signing. 90 min +4: Maguire wins yet another header from a corner. Yet again he slaps it off target. 90 min +3: The referee acts now, though, as he shows Milivojevic a yellow card for arguing the toss a bit too forcefully. When the game restarts, Rashford tries a curler towards the top right. Guaita tips it over. 90 min +2: Lindelof knocks Ayew to the ground. Ayew screams and demands a free kick, but nothing\u2019s forthcoming. 90 min +1: The first of 11 added minutes passes by without incident. 90 min: So now they go fairly direct, Dann sending a long pass down the inside right. Zaha spins Lindelof and races to the United box. He flashes a shot towards the bottom right. De Gea manages to turn it away for a corner that leads to nothing. Magnificent save. 89 min: Palace are enjoying a lot of possession right now ... but only in their own half. Every time they probe upfield they\u2019re forced to turn tail. 87 min: Fernandes has really come into his own in these late stages. From the left of the D, he curls a shot towards the bottom left. Guaita does well to anticipate and claim. 86 min: Mitchell throws Lingard a dummy with a crisp Cruyff Turn. Not a bad way to introduce yourself to a match. 84 min: Palace send on two subs, replacing the stricken Van Aanholt and McCarthy with Riedewald and Mitchell. 82 min: Van Aanholt was Palace\u2019s last-minute hero at Old Trafford earlier this season. Now he\u2019s wheeled off in severe pain. Here\u2019s to a quick recovery. 80 min: As Martial slotted home, he accidentally came together with Van Aanholt, who flipped over his back and landed awkwardly. Not sure whether he\u2019s damaged his wrist, elbow or shoulder, but it\u2019s a serious one because the stretcher is on and he\u2019s been given oxygen. Fernandes flicks the ball infield from the left. Rashford knocks a first-time pass down the channel for Martial, who strides into the box and slams a glorious drive into the bottom right. 76 min: United have steadied the ship now. Palace aren\u2019t carrying the same threat now. Here\u2019s Mark Childs: \u201cAfter that VAR decision, I was curious and found this EPL page that explained the lines are drawn from one of five cameras. So, Ayew\u2019s offside was obviously not a \u2018clear and obvious\u2019 error and the line was drawn from a camera placed about 8 yards away from the actual offside line. Absurd. Also, I think VAR should have given Palace a penalty for that Lindelof challenge in the first half. I\u2019m a United fan.\u201d 74 min: Rashford skedaddles down the left and pulls back for ... Fernandes. And you can\u2019t keep a good man down. He takes a first-time smack towards the bottom left, totally foxing Guaita with a fine strike ... but the ball caroms off the base of the post and away. So unlucky! 73 min: Schlupp comes on for McArthur, and is quickly in the thick of it, dragging a shot wide right from distance. 72 min: Fernandes attempts a curler towards the bottom left. It\u2019s always sailing wide. He\u2019s been quiet tonight, Fernandes, verging on poor by his own stellar standards ... and yet he\u2019s still got an assist to his name. He\u2019s some player. What a signing. 70 min: We go again. \u201cI completely agree about VAR, pretty much a disaster from the start of the season,\u201d begins David Wall. \u201cGiven that, and I imagine a large majority of supporters, players, managers, etc agree, why is no one seriously considering just scrapping it from the end of the season? All I\u2019ve heard is that now it\u2019s here we have to just live with it and hope it gets better. But that didn\u2019t apply to things that actually were beneficial (or would have been if they\u2019d been applied for more than about two weeks), like the vanishing spray to mark where the wall should be, moving a free-kick forward if there was dissent, the Zenith Data Systems Cup, or the Anglo-Italian Cup. They went almost as soon as they appeared. Well, perhaps not the last one.\u201d 69 min: As the players imbibe, Roy Hodgson takes a good old pop at the referee. Whatever could be on his mind? 67 min: Palace haven\u2019t let their heads drop, to their great credit. They ping it this way and that, then Ayew tries to spin Maguire just inside the box. He tries to curl a pass around the corner to release Zaha, but the ball flies out for a goal kick. And that\u2019s drinks. 65 min: Maguire is booked for a cynical tug at Ayew. \u201cAs a United fan, I can today speak against VAR without suffering accusations of bias,\u201d writes Matt Richman from atop the high ground. \u201cI hate it. That was scarcely an inch offside, to all human observers level, and was deserved.\u201d 64 min: Zaha comes in from the right and curls a pass towards McArthur, in plenty of space to the left of the United D. He enters the box and should have a dig, but tries to thread a pass across to Ayew at the far post, and gets it all wrong. 63 min: United finally get Matic and Lingard on. They replace McTominay and Greenwood. 62 min: Martial breezes down the inside-left channel and feeds Rashford on the overlap. Rashford slams a low diagonal shot towards the bottom right, but Guaita is behind it all the way. 60 min: But play goes on before they can make their swap, and McCarthy takes a shot from the edge of the United D. He really catches it sweetly, but it\u2019s straight at De Gea, who handles well. 59 min: United prepare to make a double change. Matic and Lingard - who scored the winner against Palace in the 2016 FA Cup final - wait on the touchline. 57 min: That\u2019s a huge let-off for United, who haven\u2019t really got going in this second half. Will that close shave wake them from their slumber? Turns out Ayew didn\u2019t cut his toenails last night, and the goal is chalked off. A couple of millimetres in it. It\u2019s not Palace\u2019s night with the old VAR. This had been coming. Zaha twists Wan-Bissaka this way and that as he enters the box on the left. He fires towards the far post, where Ayew slides home. Easy as that! 53 min: Van Aanholt makes good down the inside left and tries to instigate a one-two with Zaha. Had he been given a return ball, he\u2019d have been clear on goal. But Zaha decides to take over himself, and looks to curl into the top right. Maguire blocks. 52 min: Van Aanholt glides in from the left and takes a shot. It ping-pongs off a few bodies before nearly dropping at the feet of Zaha. Not quite, though. Lindelof and Maguire are in position to sort it all out. 50 min: Ward clumsily clanks McTominay to the ground out on the left. Fernandes flicks the free kick into the mixer. It skims off Milivojevic\u2019s head, but doesn\u2019t fall to anyone in gold, and Sakho is able to clear. 49 min: Martial burns past Sakho on the left and wins a corner. Fernandes gets two goes, but neither delivery beats the first man. Palace clear the second corner. 47 min: United will be looking to improve on their first-half performance, scoreline notwithstanding. They impose themselves with some calm possession in their own half. It\u2019s the second half! Palace get the ball rolling again. No half-time changes. BT Sport have shown another angle of the Zaha-Lindelof incident. Lindelof did indeed touch the ball, but only after connecting with Zaha\u2019s heel. Pundits Robbie Savage and Rio Ferdinand agree that it should have been a penalty. Palace will feel fairly aggrieved at that, then, especially as United went on to score the opener a couple of minutes later. The old sliding doors opening and closing like billy-o there. But whatever the rights and wrongs are of that particular decision, we can surely all agree on one thing: VAR has been a risible fiasco from the get-go, hasn\u2019t it. Half-time entertainment. For your aural leisure and pleasure. The half-time whistle goes just as the game really got going. United lead thanks to Rashford\u2019s calm, controlled, measured finish. Two minutes before the net rippled, Zaha and Lindelof came together in the box, but replays suggest the United defender got a touch, which was why the referee wasn\u2019t interested. And so here we are. It\u2019s been a good game, and the second half promises to be a lot of fun. No flipping! 45 min +4: Milivojevic curls towards the top left. It\u2019s going in, and De Gea does extremely well to claw it out for a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece. 45 min +3: Townsend has a smash. Maguire bravely gets in the road. Then Greenwood shoves Zaha over, just to the left of the United box. A free kick in an extremely interesting position. In the first of four extra minutes, Fernandes drops back and dinks a gentle ball down the middle for Rashford, who enters the box, takes a touch to the left, drops a shoulder to sit Van Aanholt down, and passes the ball into the bottom right. What a gorgeous finish! 45 min: But the ball doesn\u2019t go out of play. Wan-Bissaka fires a low cross through the Palace box. It misses everyone. But United come straight back at Palace, and ... 44 min: Milivojevic slips a pass down the inside-left channel for Zaha, who proceeds to turn Lindelof inside and out, like an old sock. Zaha enters the area. There\u2019s contact, and Zaha goes down. But the referee isn\u2019t interested in giving a penalty. VAR may take a second look when the ball goes out of play. 42 min: Fernandes threads a low shot inches wide of the left-hand post. Both goals are living a slightly charmed life at the minute. 40 min: Van Aanholt curls infield from the left. Lindelof clanks a dreadful clearance straight at Ayew, who belts a shot towards the top left. Lindelof is very grateful to see De Gea punch clear. 38 min: Fernandes sashays in from the left and sprays a diagonal ball towards Wan-Bissaka on the other flank. He crosses long and another corner\u2019s won. Fernandes takes it from the left, and Maguire wins his third header from a corner, again leaping high over Sakho. He sends this effort wide right. Palace are asking for trouble here. Maguire\u2019s likely to get one on target at some point. 36 min: Rashford swings a ball in from the right, forcing Dann to slide it out for a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece, other than a yellow card for Wan-Bissaka, who left one on McCarthy\u2019s foot as the pair challenged for a loose ball. 34 min: Pogba and Greenwood nearly open Palace up down the inside right. Not quite. Pogba flicks the ball round McArthur then goes to ground, but he\u2019s not getting the penalty he\u2019s looking for. 32 min: Maguire has taken a whack upside the head. It requires a good once-over from the physio. After a long check, he\u2019s good to go again. 30 min: This is most uncharacteristic behaviour from Greenwood. Martial comes in from the left and crosses low; Greenwood scuffs a scruffy shot wide right. Very strange; you\u2019d expect the brilliant youngster to dispatch that clinically into the bottom corner. 29 min: Wan-Bissaka has a dig from the right-hand corner of the Palace box. His effort to score his first goal for his new club against his old club is blocked at source. 27 min: Maybe he\u2019s been told to get central. McArthur dinks a cross in from the left. Zaha\u2019s the man in the middle, but the cross is a little bit too high, and behind him, and he can\u2019t get any power on his header. 26 min: During the break, Roy Hodgson gives Zaha a proper pep talk. More accurately, a Pep talk: he\u2019s fully animated in the Guardiola style. He\u2019s obviously seen something the winger can take advantage of. Let\u2019s keep an eye out for that, then. 25 min: And that, my old MBM pals, is drinks. Squirty bottles all round! 23 min: Greenwood comes in from the right and is unceremoniously upended by McCarthy. Then Ayew clatters into Pogba. And finally McTominay climbs all over Ayew. This game is being fiercely contested. File under: hard but fair. 21 min: Rashford attempts a snapshot from the edge of the Palace box. Townsend gets right up in his grille to block, and takes a kick on the foot for his trouble. Both players crumble in pain; both get up soon enough, frowning and hopping awhile before moving on. That was a good old-fashioned blood-and-thunder 50-50 challenge. 19 min: Townsend is clumsily barged over by Pogba, out on the right wing. He gets up and takes the set piece himself, launching it long towards Sakho. The big defender can\u2019t get a header goalwards. Palace launch another attack, Milivojevic looping down the middle. Dann tries to cushion a header down to the feet of Zaha, but his team-mate doesn\u2019t read his intention in time, and the ball trundles harmlessly through to De Gea. 17 min: Zaha dribbles down the left and nearly busts his way into the box, but he slips at the crucial moment and the attack peters out. For a team who have lost five matches in a row, Palace are looking pretty confident right now. 15 min: Milivojevic creams a diagonal ball towards Ward, again free in plenty of space on the right. But there\u2019s too much juice behind the pass, and it sails out for a goal kick. Fosu-Mensah, making his first start for United since 2017, has been caught sleeping a couple of times. 13 min: Ayew is nearly released by a long pass down the left, but the ball drifts out of play just before he reaches it. Had he got there in time, United were light at the back. 12 min: Martial wins a corner down the left, and Maguire certainly meets this one. He gets the leap on Sakho, but flashes it powerfully over the bar from close range. After a slow, uncertain start, United are beginning to make their presence felt. 10 min: But this is better from Wan-Bissaka, who makes himself available down the right. Rashford finds him. Wan-Bissaka wins a corner. Fernandes curls it in, towards Maguire, who doesn\u2019t react when Sakho misses his header. The ball twangs off Maguire\u2019s startled coupon, and Palace clear. 8 min: McArthur and Zaha busy themselves down the left. Wan-Bissaka hasn\u2019t made the most confident start. He\u2019s fortunate that Lindelof is on point, and that Palace over-elaborate when a no-nonsense attack looked on. 6 min: Fernandes dithers on the ball in midfield and is stripped of possession by Ayew. Palace flood forward. Dann crosses deep from the right. McCarthy heds down for Zaha, who considers a volley. Instead, the ball\u2019s teed up for Van Aanholt, who has a smash from distance. His effort is blocked. United need to wake up here. 4 min: Zaha might be in the mood against his old club, you know. He glides down the left wing, momentarily threatening to go all the way to the box. But he loses confidence in himself mid-run and turns tail when faced by Lindelof. Still, he\u2019s looking lively. 2 min: Palace are quickly on the front foot. Zaha tries to release Ward, in acres out on the right, but his pass fizzes into the stand. Then another phase, as Zaha sails in from the left, skips past Wan-Bissaka with great ease, and pearls one towards the top left. De Gea gets a strong hand behind it. A fast start by the hosts. United get the ball rolling ... but not before all the players take a knee. Black lives matter. The teams are out! Crystal Palace wear their red and blue stripes, while Manchester United sport second-choice gold. Not long now. A big result just in, with implications for Manchester United. Leicester have bounced back from that farcical defeat at Bournemouth with a 2-0 win over Sheffield United. That\u2019s a fine victory over obdurate opponents, and they\u2019re now three points clear of United in fourth. The race for the Champions League looks like going down to the wire, and a possible final-day winner-takes-all showdown between Leicester and United. One way or another, it\u2019s going to be dramatic. A chat with Roy Hodgson. \u201cIf you analyse runs of results, there are always things you\u2019re not that disappointed with, and others that you are. We\u2019ve not exactly had the best of luck, we\u2019ve made a rod for our own back in a couple of games by giving things away, but these things do happen. It\u2019s important that we put on a good show, a good performance. I\u2019m not sure what playing at home means any more! But our last home game was a good one against Chelsea and hopefully we can reproduce that tonight.\u201d A word with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. \u201cWe know what we have to do, come here on the front foot and start positive. That\u2019s what we want to see in the beginning of the game. Timothy Fosu-Mensah has been waiting for his chance and will be ready. Scott McTominay has done a great job this season so we felt it was time to freshen up [the midfield]. We lost to Palace at home so we know how they can hurt you. Their front three are quick and skilful and can score a goal from nothing.\u201d Palace make two changes to the team that went down at Aston Villa last weekend. Andros Townsend and James McCarthy take the place of Cheikhou Kouyate, who drops to the bench, and Christian Benteke, who is suspended. United make two changes to the side that conceded a late equaliser at home to Southampton. In come former Palace loanee Timothy Fosu-Mensah and Scott McTominay. Nemanja Matic drops to the bench, while Luke Shaw is injured. Crystal Palace: Guaita, Ward, Dann, Sakho, van Aanholt, Townsend, McArthur, Milivojevic, McCarthy, Zaha, Ayew. Subs: Meyer, Kouyate, Hennessey, Schlupp, Kelly, Woods, Mitchell, Pierrick, Riedewald. Manchester United: de Gea, Wan Bissaka, Lindelof, Maguire, Fosu-Mensah, McTominay, Pogba, Greenwood, Bruno Fernandes, Rashford, Martial. Subs: Bailly, Mata, Lingard, Fred, Dalot, James, Romero, Ighalo, Matic. Referee: Graham Scott (Oxfordshire). Ah yes, Crystal Palace against Manchester United. We\u2019re all thinking about it, aren\u2019t we, so here goes. This is unlikely to be quite so incendiary, though the stakes are high for the visitors. A point or more will take them into the Champions League places, above a fast-unravelling Leicester City. They\u2019re favourites to take all three, unbeaten since mid-January, and one injury-time goal against Southampton away from five wins in a row. They\u2019re one of the league\u2019s form sides. Palace by contrast have lost their last five. The Eagles will, however, take heart from their win at Old Trafford early in the season. That 2-1 win ended a 22-match winless streak against United; perhaps they can end a barren spell in this fixture by beating United at Selhurst Park for the first time since 1991. They can draw strength from the run that preceded their current losing sequence: four wins in a row without conceding a single goal. It\u2019s feast or famine for Palace ... and it\u2019s on! Kick off: 8.15pm BST."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
