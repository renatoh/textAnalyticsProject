Aun Sayal, 21, from Ilford, east London, offered fake goods for sale online and arranged for money to be transferred to him. The purchasers never received the goods, and when they attempted to trace him through email, telephone numbers and addresses left on the websites, they received no response. Yesterday he was sentenced at Guildford crown court to two years in prison, after earlier pleading guilty to eight charges of obtaining money transfer by deception, with 21 other offences taken into consideration. Surrey police began investigating Sayal in July 2002, after a local man bought a washing machine from him on eBay and never received it. He contacted police after getting no response from Sayal. Officers identified another 38 victims across Britain, the US and Europe. The victims were largely trying to buy electrical white goods and laptop computers. Victims also lost money to Sayal on cookingtonight.co.uk and lookatourgoods.com. Back in 2001, Sayal became one of the first people in Britain to be prosecuted successfully for this type of internet fraud. Sayal, then just a teenager, was sentenced to nine months in a young offenders institution after police in Ilford found he was pulling a similar auction house fraud. He was released in March 2002. Police at the time believed Sayal had made up to \u00a3150,000 by convincing victims to buy high quality electrical goods from him and then failing to deliver. He pleaded guilty at London's Snaresbrook crown court to 20 counts of \"obtaining a money transfer by deception\" between December 2000 and July 2001. He committed seven of the offences after he was arrested. DC Tony Noble, the officer in charge of the Surrey police investigation, said: \"People can be very vulnerable when purchasing goods over the internet. This result shows that internet fraud is not beyond the reach of the law but that offenders can and will be found and brought to justice.\" Officers recommended that anyone buying from a reputable auction site look very carefully at any links they may be led to off that site. They also cautioned online shoppers to be wary of goods sales hosted on free webspace, such as Geocities or Yahoo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
