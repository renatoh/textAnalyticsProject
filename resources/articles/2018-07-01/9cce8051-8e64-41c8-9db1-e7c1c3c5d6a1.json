The proposed transfer had stalled because Leicester wanted the City winger Patrick Roberts as part of the deal but it is thought that demand has been dropped. Mahrez had been holding out for a sizeable sum he believed Leicester owed him, and this may now have been resolved. Pep Guardiola turned to the Algerian in the January transfer window when his first choice, Alexis S\u00e1nchez, opted to sign for Manchester United. A move failed to materialise after Leicester demanded around \u00a395m. No formal offer was made then. The total value of the current deal is expected to rise to around \u00a375m, its basic \u00a360m fee eclipsing City\u2019s record \u00a357.2m paid to Athletic Bilbao for defender Aymeric Laporte in January. Joe Hart, the former England and City No 1, participated in Monday\u2019s opening day of training with his future in limbo. The 31-year-old will almost certainly depart after being loaned out by Guardiola for the past two seasons. Angus Gunn, the No 3 goalkeeper, is set to join Southampton. Barcelona sign Gr\u00eamio\u2019s Arthur for \u00a335.5m Barcelona have confirmed the signing of Brazilian midfielder Arthur from Gr\u00eamio on a six-year deal. The club said in a statement that the transfer fee for the 21-year-old, who joins immediately, was an initial \u20ac31m euros (\u00a327.5m) with an extra \u20ac9m (\u00a38m) in \u201cvariables\u201d. The total value of the deal is therefore thought to be \u20ac40m (\u00a335.5m). Arthur helped Gr\u00eamio win the Copa Libertadores last year and arrives just one day after compatriot Paulinho left the Camp Nou and returned to China\u2019s Guangzhou Evergrande. The clubs initially agreed that Arthur would join Barcelona next January, but the departures of Paulinho and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta \u2013 and a serious knee injury suffered by academy player Carles Ale\u00f1\u00e1 \u2013 resulted in the transfer being brought forward.
