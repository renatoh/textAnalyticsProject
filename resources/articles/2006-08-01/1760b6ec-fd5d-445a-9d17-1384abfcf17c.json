The 29-year-old sustained the injury when he was elbowed by Hermann Hreidarsson in Saturday's defeat at Charlton. Hreidarsson was sent off for the offence but Davies was later shown the red card following a separate incident involving Amady Faye. Davies had a scan yesterday and will have an operation today to determine the extent of the injury. Bolton's manager, Sam Allardyce, said: \"It is terrible news for Kevin and the squad. I feel for Kevin. He is the ultimate professional who always gives his best no matter what strain he is under from opposition defenders.\" Allardyce believes Davies came in from some rough treatment in the game and feels he was dealt with harshly by the referee Mike Dean over his sending-off. He confirmed Bolton would be appealing against the dismissal. \"Even though Kevin will be out of action for six weeks, we feel it is right to appeal against his dismissal. There was nothing in the incident and he was unjustly sent from the field.\" Gordon Strachan is on the verge of making his eighth signing of the summer, after Thomas Gravesen held talks with the Celtic manager in Glasgow yesterday. The arrival of the Real Madrid midfielder, who has struggled to hold down a first-team place since his \u00a32.5m move from Everton in January 2005, will offset the imminent departure from Parkhead of Stilian Petrov, who is expected to join Aston Villa this week. Celtic will receive upwards of \u00a35m for Petrov and save on the wages of the Scottish Premierleague's highest-paid player, who earns about \u00a332,000 a week. The SPL has announced that the season's first Old Firm match, at Parkhead, will kick off at 12.30 on September 23. Gareth Barry, who signed a new four-year contract at Villa on Sunday, admitted yesterday that he had decided to leave the club until Martin O'Neill's arrival changed his mind. \"My decision was made before David O'Leary got the sack,\" he said. \"I wanted to know if clubs were interested in me because I felt it was the time to move on for the sake of my career.\" Barry's view changed following talks with O'Neill. \"I had a few conversations with the manager and he slowly changed my mind and brought me back confident of staying and improving my game as well,\" said Villa's captain. \"He has got confidence in me and getting back in the England squad. He has got confidence that he can improve my game to another level and I believe what he says as well.\" Leeds could face disciplinary action amid a probe into whether their players were guilty of a mass confrontation with the referee Steve Bennett during the 1-0 win at Sheffield Wednesday on Sunday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
