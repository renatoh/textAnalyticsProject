European literature in translation is of particular interest. Retired health professional, 70, Toronto A: Alex Preston, author and critic, writes: Far from being a \u201cdead hand\u201d (thanks for that, Ian McEwan), modernism, the \u201cmake it new\u201d spirit of experimentation and risk-taking, is the engine that drives literature forward. If you haven\u2019t read him already, there\u2019s Roberto Bola\u00f1o. OK, so he\u2019s not European \u2013 he\u2019s from Chile \u2013 but his two greatest novels, The Savage Detectives and the epic 2666, will blow your mind. They are both rendered in luminous English by Natasha Wimmer. I\u2019ve recently fallen in love with the work of the Polish author Olga Tokarczuk. Start with the Man Booker International-winning Flights, then move on to her masterpiece, Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead. Unusually, Tokarczuk has two translators \u2013 Flights was Jennifer Croft while Drive Your Plow... was Antonia Lloyd-Jones. Annie Ernaux\u2019s The Years, translated by Alison L Strayer, is ostensibly the author\u2019s autobiography, but if a book can be both sinuous and fragmentary, this one is, circling around the truth, presenting a collage of images, episodes, memories and flights of imagination. The narrative voice moves between the first person plural and the third person. It\u2019s just a glorious novel \u2013 think JM Coetzee meets Joan Didion. A few more, both translated and otherwise: how about the genius that is (or, sadly, was) Jos\u00e9 Saramago? Start with Blindness and move on to Seeing, the former translated by Giovanni Pontieri, the latter by Margaret Jull Costa. I\u2019ve been raving to everyone about Marlon James\u2019s latest, Black Leopard, Red Wolf, but if you\u2019re into work that pushes at the boundaries of language and form, you should go for two earlier novels \u2013 the Booker-winning A Brief History of Seven Killings and the devastating The Book of Night Women. Finally, Ali Smith is one of our greatest living novelists, the Virginia Woolf of our times. Read her seasonal quartet (never have I longed for a novel like I\u2019m longing for Summer), read How to Be Both, read The Accidental, read everything!
