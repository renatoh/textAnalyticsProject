The beloved 1930s film treatments, artefacts of the early sound period, were largely stagebound yet possessed of a crackling, bawdy, close-to-the-source life. Auteuil has fashioned hidebound museum pieces that expand the backdrop with sun-dappled glimpses of port activity, while generally resisting any notes of modernity or change of emphasis. What modicum of cosy Sunday-afternoon pleasure they provide stems from the performers: Rapha\u00ebl Personnaz (from Tavernier's The Princess of Montpensier) and Victoire B\u00e9l\u00e9zy make a handsome couple as the barman Marius and his on-off sweetheart Fanny, while Auteuil and Jean-Pierre Darroussin are typically dependable as Marius's father and love rival respectively. Still, in 2013, this seems a peculiarly antiquated project for anybody to be undertaking: not just cin\u00e9ma de papa, but cinema de grand-papa."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
