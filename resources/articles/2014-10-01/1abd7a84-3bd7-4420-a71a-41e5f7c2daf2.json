Harris, the co-founder of Apollo Global Management, has been seeking to invest in the English game for some time and, with his business partner, David Blitzer, sounded out his compatriot Randy Lerner over a potential purchase of Aston Villa this year. Palace are one of a number of prospective investment opportunities he is considering as he seeks a foothold in the Premier League. Bloomberg suggested on Friday night that Harris was close to securing a deal but that assertion appears premature at best, with it by no means certain that Palace\u2019s owners, CPFC 2010, would be willing to sell a club who were promoted to the top flight in 2013 and finished in mid-table last season. The co-chairman Steve Parish has previously made it clear that he considers himself and his three fellow board members \u201creluctant guardians\u201d of the team they have long supported. They are under no immediate financial pressure to sell, with any chance of a potential takeover apparently in its infancy at best. Bloomberg claimed that two sources, who had requested anonymity, had confirmed the talks, with neither Harris nor Palace willing to comment. The agency quoted Sal Galatioto, the founder of Galatioto Sports Partners, which represented Comcast-Spectacor in its sale of the NBA franchise 76ers to Harris in 2011. \u201cJosh obviously knows how to run pro-sports franchises,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting investment that should be a very good one for him over the long run. English Premier League soccer is arguably the best soccer in the world and it\u2019s very valuable media content. It\u2019s growing in other parts of the world, especially North America.\u201d The suggestion from one of the sources was that Parish, the public face of the current owners, would stay on to run the club for Harris. The businessman was estimated to be worth $2.1bn and, with Blitzer, added the National Hockey League\u2019s Devils and their arena, the Prudential Centre in Newark, to his portfolio last year. The 49-year-old\u2019s enthusiasm in buying Villa appeared to wane over the summer. Villa are joined by Manchester United, Liverpool, Sunderland and Arsenal in having American owners. Palace were bought out of administration by the CPFC 2010 consortium \u2013 comprised of Parish and his fellow wealthy fans Martin Long, Steve Browett and Jeremy Hosking \u2013 in the summer of 2010 and have shrewdly galvanised the club in the period since. They achieved an unlikely promotion to the Premier League through the play-offs in 2013 and, after recruiting Tony Pulis as manager a year ago, finished 11th last term, with its associated \u00a374m in prize money, the third-highest placing in their history. The team, under the stewardship of Neil Warnock, sit 16th in the table going into Saturday\u2019s visit to West Bromwich Albion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
