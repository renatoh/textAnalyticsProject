The former leader of the Scottish National party, whose shrewd leftish populism pushed his party into second place in the Scottish parliament, is hoping to square the decision with his party's national executive and his constituency activists at Banff and Buchan this weekend. It will mean persuading his official chauffeur, Stewart Stevenson, to stand aside as the SNP's prospective parliamentary candidate for the seat where he was adopted after Mr Salmond decided to leave the Commons. Mr Stevenson was said last night to be ready to act \"in the best interests of the party\" - provided the executive and local supporters rallied to Mr Salmond's decision. Behind the change of heart lies a mixture of political strategy and personal preference, SNP insiders say. But the idea that their best known champion may prefer the larger pool of Westminster politics may startle some SNP activists. \"He's bored with Holyrood,\" crowed one Scottish Labour MP last night. It is known that John Swinney, the moderate MP who succeeded Mr Salmond as SNP leader last summer, wants a \"heavy hitter\" to remain at Westminster when the party's other five MPs step down at the expected May election. Mr Salmond, 46, certainly fits that bill. Since his farewell press conference at the Commons on July 21, Donald Dewar, Scotland's first minister and a big beast of the political jungle, has died - to be succeeded by Henry McLeish, a less tempting Labour target for Mr Salmond. Mr McLeish has been moving to establish himself and is poised for a showdown with his fellow Fife MP, the chancellor, Gordon Brown, over his promise that the Scottish executive will pay for both medical and social care of old people confined to nursing homes. That formula, which would cost Mr McLeish \u00a3100m of his budget - provided by the Treasury - is in line with the Sutherland report on care of the elderly. But Alan Milburn, health secretary, has rejected paying for social care on grounds of cost. Labour's problems in Scotland, where it narrowly fought off an SNP challenge in last month's Falkirk byelection, were further underlined yesterday by reports that Mr McLeish wants to change the name of the Scottish executive - to the Scottish government. That could signal a less cautious post-Dewar approach to devolution, at the risk of marking another milestone in the SNP's ambition for Scottish independence. Some Labour MPs said yesterday it was all a misunderstanding; others believed that it heralded a serious intent to \"rebrand\" the executive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
