The Arsenal vice-chairman stance will have raised eyebrows within Soho Square where he remains an FA councillor, though Dein said he intends to use his twin powers to search for a compromise that will be embraced by Fifa and Uefa. At St James' Park they were grateful for Dein's intervention. There was no comment from the Newcastle hierarchy yesterday but they are in ongoing discussions with the FA over Owen and have prepared a legal case. Newcastle's ultimate aim is to retrieve \u00a320m. They will argue that not only does that sum represent some of Owen's wages not covered by the FA's existing insurance policy, but the cost of replacing Owen whilst he is out of action, probably for the entire season. Newcastle spent \u00a310m on buying Obafemi Martins from Internazionale in August and will be paying the Nigeria international substantial wages. Had Owen been fit and available after Germany, Newcastle are expected to argue that Martins would not have been purchased as he is similar in style to Owen. In addition to being forced into the market for a player they would not necessarily have targeted, despite the manager Glenn Roeder's assertions to the contrary, Newcastle will also point to the depreciation in value of Owen. It is 13 months since they paid Real Madrid a club- record \u00a317.5m for the England striker but Newcastle would have to settle for around half that if he were to be sold when fit again next summer. One other factor Newcastle will force is the wider damage done to the business. With Owen in the team they would anticipate being higher in the Premiership table, with greater revenue streams as a consequence of that and ultimately with more place prize-money at the end of the season. Although Newcastle are not part of the G14 grouping, Dein is sympathetic to their case as Arsenal lost Philippe Senderos to injury when he was in Germany with Switzerland and the young centre-half has yet to feature in Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side this season. \"We have got the Michael Owen issue where he has been injured in the World Cup and could be out for a whole year,\" Dein said. \"In our [Arsenal's] case, we had Philippe Senderos injured in the World Cup and we haven't seen him play for Arsenal this season and we are already in October. The G14 will back Newcastle and support them and I hope they would support Arsenal if we decided to do something over Senderos. Why shouldn't we? In what other industry would you allow your employees to go to someone else and then be off for a length of time because effectively they were on secondment to someone else?\" The FA refused to confirm last night that it has recently enlarged its compensation pool but stressed that it is one of the few national associations in world football who do offer compensation for injury, and for permanent disability, via its insurers. The FA, moreover, feel its policy is a generous one and there will be questions raised about Dein's words coming soon after he has been voted off the FA board. It has been reported that the FA's compensation is based on percentages - for example it has agreed to pay 50% of Owen's or any other injured player's wages - but the FA said yesterday that compensation is based on a lump sum that would fully cover the wages of all but the highest-paid players."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
