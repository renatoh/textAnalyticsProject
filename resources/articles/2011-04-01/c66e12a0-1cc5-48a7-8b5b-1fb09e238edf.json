Not so much a question of when Saturday comes as when Thursday comes. Having tasted caviar in the Champions League, Spurs fans look like having to settle for fish paste next time round. Their hopes of another top-four finish continue to be cursed by home draws, the latest of which saw them frustrated by a wonderful shot from a West Bromwich Albion substitute, Simon Cox, whose first goal in the Premier League denied Harry Redknapp's side the three points which appeared to have been secured by Jermain Defoe's 100th. A win for Manchester City at Blackburn on Monday would leave Spurs four points and a lot of goals behind in fifth place. \"It's very difficult but we've just got to keep going,\" Redknapp said afterwards. \"We've had a great season and it's not over yet.\" But with his team facing trips to Chelsea and Liverpool as well as Eastlands, Spurs look like staying where they are. For some teams the Europa League presents a valuable chance to make an impact in an international setting, witness Fulham's progress to last season's final under Roy Hodgson, now in charge at West Bromwich. For Tottenham the tournament might get in the way of their next attempt to reach the Champions League. Redknapp unwittingly prompted this thought on Saturday when he reflected that \"a big help to us last year was that we didn't play European football\".There was not much wrong with their overall performance against West Bromwich. Luka Modric orchestrated the attack in his usual way, Gareth Bale and Rafael van der Vaart supplied the familiar quality of passes and crosses, Tom Huddlestone was a strong presence in midfield and Sandro beavered away after replacing Ben\u00f4it Assou-Ekotto, who was forced off with a hamstring problem after seven minutes. Tottenham were unfortunate in that Assou-Ekotto's injury occurred as he challenged Peter Odemwingie for a crossfield ball from Carlos Vela, the Nigerian breaking clear to beat Heurelho Gomes with a precise low shot. But the defence as a whole had reacted sluggishly to the initial threat. Albion generally stood up well to the ensuing siege, with Defoe and Roman Pavlyuchenko denied more than the odd glimpse of a scoring chance. Yet it was not difficult to imagine what Hodgson meant when he described his latest job as \"a work in progress\", much of which will be devoted to stopping the leakage of goals which has left Albion with the Premier League's next worst defensive record after Blackpool. While those from Pavlyuchenko and Defoe, scored after 27 and 66 minutes, were well taken they were helped by defenders standing off for a second or two, which at this level is all a striker needs. Cox's 81st-minute equaliser, however, was pure inspiration. William Gallas seemed to have closed down all the options but the West Bromwich forward took one step sideways before unleashing a shot which curled over Gomes and nestled in the top corner of the net. \"The kid's hit a world-class shot,\" said Redknapp. \"What can you do about that?\" \"I'm not surprised he's scored because I've seen him in training and he's a goalscorer,\" said Hodgson, matter-of-factly. The result has left Albion with the 40 points which would normally be enough for a team to stay up although their manager wants a few more to be sure. \"It takes us to the psychological point of 40 and most people would say that's enough,\" he said. \"I don't.\"The summer rumour mill may shortly be envisaging a queue of clubs forming outside White Hart Lane to sign Bale, Modric and other Spurs players keen on continuing to play Champions League football for somebody else. \"I don't see any reason why Tottenham should sell their best players,\" said Redknapp. \"We've got to be going forward.\" But for Spurs this was one draw too many."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
