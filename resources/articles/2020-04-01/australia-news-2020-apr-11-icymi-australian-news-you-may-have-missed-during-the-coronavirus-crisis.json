Here are the most important stories you may have missed over the past week. From the statement of George Pell\u2019s accuser to the worst coral bleaching the Great Barrier Reef has ever seen. You can find last week\u2019s list here. Revelation to be re-uploaded The ABC\u2019s major documentary series Revelation aired its final episode last Thursday, focusing on Cardinal George Pell. The reporter Sarah Ferguson obtained multiple on-camera interviews with the men who accused Pell of assault in the so-called \u201cswimming pool trial\u201d, which was discontinued by Victoria Police before it went to trial. It contained previously unpublished details of further child sexual abuse allegations against Pell. The original version was beamed out days before Pell\u2019s appeal \u2013 against a separate allegation of assault \u2013 was decided by the high court. After the verdict, it was taken offline from iView. But the ABC has stated that it stands by its reporting and the episode will be uploaded again shortly. Ferguson tweeted: \u201cWe are updating yesterday\u2019s events. Nothing has been pulled.\u201d Read the full story here. Pell accuser releases statement After Tuesday\u2019s high court decision, the man who accused Pell of sexually abusing him and another boy, released a statement urging victims of child sexual abuse to continue coming forward and to not be discouraged by the high court\u2019s decision. \u201cThere are a lot of checks and balances in the criminal justice system and the appeal process is one of them,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI respect that. But the price we pay for weighting the system in favour of the accused is that many sexual offences against children go unpunished. \u201cI would like to reassure child sexual abuse survivors that most people recognise the truth when they hear it. They know the truth when they look it in the face. I am content with that. \u201cThis case does not define me. I am a man who came forward for my friend who, sadly, is no longer with us. I am a man doing my best to be a loving dad, partner, son, brother and friend.\u201d You can read his full comments here. Great Barrier Reef suffers most widespread bleaching seen yet On Tuesday marine scientists confirmed that the Great Barrier Reef had experienced its third mass bleaching in five years.

The surreal scenes of George Pell\u2019s final verdict And finally on Tuesday\u2019s major news from the high court, read Queensland correspondent Ben Smee\u2019s feature on how the verdict was delivered. In a Covid-19 world, the courtroom for the case of the decade was nearly empty. How did the chief justice, Susan Kiefel, even deliver the verdict, when physical distancing rules meant only three journalists and two lawyers were allowed to sit inside? Read the full story here. William Tyrrell detective found guilty of illegal recording The former detective Gary Jubelin, who led the investigation into the disappearance of William Tyrrell, was found guilty on Monday of illegally recording during the investigation.
