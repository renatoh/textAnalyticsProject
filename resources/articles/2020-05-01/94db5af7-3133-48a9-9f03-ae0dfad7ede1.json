It\u2019s been a strange one, but I wouldn\u2019t have missed it for the world. Thanks so much for keeping me company this evening and adding your wit and wisdom in the comment box below. I have no idea if I\u2019ll be back for Strictly in the autumn, but fingers crossed we\u2019ll find something to keep us busy and entertained on a Saturday night, and I very much hope to be back in Rotterdam this time next year. Please stay safe and look after yourselves and each other, Hx Well this is entirely lovely. I\u2019d have been happy with two hours of this superimposed over European landmarks. I\u2019m singing along. Is everyone singing along? Hands in the air please, I\u2019ve been on this sofa for four hours and have no blood flow in my fingers. To wrap up tonight\u2019s show, this year\u2019s contestants are going to sing a special version of Love Shine A Light, just to remind everyone in the UK that it\u2019s been 23 years since we last won Eurovision. It\u2019s the perfect message to share right now \u2013 \u2018and we\u2019re all gonna shine a light together, all shine a light to light the way.\u2019 It\u2019s easy to be cynical, but stuff like Eurovision feels like a beacon of solidarity and togetherness in a crazy world. Hooray, Graham Norton is live on the show! He\u2019s got a bit tearful, and I know how he feels. Tonight has been quite the rollercoaster. \u2018God that was awkward.\u2019 Graham\u2019s back in the room. Here\u2019s a special message from Bjorn from Abba \u2013 we must be building up to grand finale if they\u2019re wheeling out Eurovision legends of this magnitude. He has the most soothing voice and we need him reading the CBeebies bedtime story. Ooh Denmark was nice this year too, a good singalong/foot tappy number. Sad that they only showed 20 seconds of that performance of Fai Rumore in Verona. Worth a full watch. The good news is that quite a few artists have announced they\u2019re coming back with a new song next year, which is just as it should be. Time to meet the final eight 2020 contestants, including Malta, another of my favourites from this year. Love a happy clappy banger. Aww, there\u2019s a nice VT from some former Eurovision contestants. Bit dusty in here. Also loving Conchita celebrating not wearing underwear. Since we\u2019re on a roll with former Eurovision winners hawking their new singles, last year\u2019s winner Duncan Lawrence is now singing his new single \u2018Someone Else\u2019. The opening lyric appears to be \u2018Lately I found myself on the crowded side of the street, eating in busy restaurants every night of the week\u2019. Either Duncan is trolling us, or The Netherlands has gone completely rogue. This is a perfectly lovely song if bleak break-up ballads are your thing, but can we follow a general policy of \u2018play the Eurovision hits\u2019, just for one night? For everything else, there\u2019s YouTube. Nikkie Tutorials is back. I\u2019m reliably informed she\u2019s some kind of influencer/makeup artist. Sorry, I am very much not down with this kids in this respect. It\u2019s NETTA time. In case you\u2019ve never visited Planet Eurovision until now, Netta won Eurovision for Israel in 2018 with \u2018Toy\u2019. However tonight she\u2019s going to sing a song called \u2018Cuckoo\u2019, which feels slightly off-piste. OK now I need more wine, we\u2019ve gone from quiet family wake to full viking funeral. Oh wait, I said earlier that Bulgaria was the one that people thought might win, but actually it was Romania. Sorry. Hang on, someone has just told me it was Bulgaria. Ignore me. Incidentally if you loved Iceland\u2019s entry this year, my friend and fellow Eurovision fan Rob interviewed Dadi for his podcast and it\u2019s really great. Eight more contestants from this year coming up, including my absolute favourite song of the year. Anyone who has ever followed this liveblog in previous years will know that I can\u2019t resist a generic dance bop, and Germany\u2019s Ben Dolic absolutely nailed it this year with \u2018Violent Thing\u2019. It wouldn\u2019t have won but it\u2019s my favourite song of this year\u2019s competition. Don\u2019t @ me, I stopped caring hours ago. Also anyone joining late and hoping this show is an uplifting couple of hours of escapist joyful eurononsense, run away now. I\u2019m emotionally drained. Ooh it\u2019s Michael Schulte! He sang \u2018You Let Me Walk Alone\u2019 for Germany in 2018, which is the perfect social distancing anthem. He\u2019s going to sing Nicole\u2019s \u2018A Little Peace\u2019 (which won Eurovision in 1982) with Ilse from The Common Linnets, who came second in 2014. Just FYI I do not have an encyclopaedic Eurovision memory (although I know several people who do), but I DO have Google. Iceland! What a great song, I\u2019ll be doing this daft dance in my kitchen for the rest of time. OK I\u2019m struggling a bit with contestants making little heartfelt speeches, and then Graham taking the piss out of their decor. Stop it. Time for another eight contestants \u2013 Spain, Ireland, Austria and Iceland were four of my favourites this year. Bulgaria was a bit bleak for my tastes but it was pegged as a possible winner. Now it\u2019s time to celebrate all 41 Eurovision countries with a montage of famous locations shot by night. The accompanying music is an orchestral version of \u2018Love Shine A Light\u2019 played by the Rotterdam Philarmonic Orchestra. Since most of us have haven\u2019t left our home towns in months, this feels particularly \u2018here\u2019s what you could have won\u2019 harsh. Oh god that was gorgeous. So many beautiful places, can\u2019t wait to visit more of them. The next performance is from Marija Serifovic, who won Eurovision for Serbia in 2007 with \u2018Molitva\u2019. There\u2019s a huge amount of love for Marija in the Eurovision fandom, and this is arguably one of the best vocal performances we\u2019ve ever seen on the contest. Molitva means \u2018prayer\u2019, and this has the most glorious strings. Love this version on the streets of Belgrade, absolutely beautiful. Very much enjoying seeing the houses and dogs of all this year\u2019s entries. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one finding this all a bit of a downer, but in light of the current situation it was probably the right thing to do, even if it does feel a bit like a wake. It\u2019s really hard to hit the right note at the moment, so I\u2019m just going to appreciate the effort that has gone into this. Time to meet eight more 2020 contestants, including some Skrillex-style madness from Latvia, with the incredibly topical title, \u2018Still Breathing\u2019. I\u2019d love to think that they\u2019d have followed this up with James Newman\u2019s \u2018My Last Breath\u2019, but in reality Latvia was never making it out of the semis. Next up it\u2019s a performance from Antonio Diodato, who was going to represent Italy at this year\u2019s Eurovision. For me Fai Rumore was the dark horse of the competition, but he\u2019s decided to sing Volare instead. Oh. Somebody called Nikkie Tutorials (possibly not her real name) is telling us what\u2019s going on online. No mention of this liveblog, which is just rude. Now it\u2019s time to meet Viki Gabor, who won Junior Eurovision in 2019. She is in Poland with a shonky delay on the sound, as is traditional. Her tips for kids watching right now is to \u2018make your dreams come true\u2019, which is super unhelpful. Viki is wearing a padlock as a necklace, which is either random Polish fashion or a weird lockdown reference. The Eurovision kids are going to sing \u2018Hallelujah\u2019 with Gali Atari, who won Eurovision in 1979 for Israel. It\u2019s got a Pink Windmill vibe about it, which is an incredibly niche reference. Time for another special guest, and it\u2019s M\u00e5ns Zelmerlow again! Apparently there is no limit on the number of times he can sing Heroes in one evening. \u2018What this song needs is an acoustic breakdown, and lose the leather trousers\u2019. Said no one ever. Just so you\u2019re clear on the format this evening, you\u2019re going to see a clip and a Facebook motivational quote from every one of this year\u2019s entries. By the end we will all be broken, empty husks. What makes 2020 all the more sad is that there are some brilliant songs in this year\u2019s lineup \u2013 fom this first batch of eight Russia, Azerbaijan, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden could all have ended up in the top 10. Also the man from France is dreamy. Time for us to meet some of this year\u2019s contestants, and hear a bit of their songs. If you haven\u2019t heard all these by now, Spotify has them all on a playlist. Time for our first special guest! It\u2019s Irish legend Johnny Logan, who has won the contest three times. Luckily one of those songs was called \u2018What\u2019s Another Year?\u2019, which makes Johnny suddenly extremely topical. He\u2019s going to sing it for us. This is such a lovely song, and Johnny is accompanied by lots of fans singing from their living rooms, and our hosts for this evening. Oh crikey, I knew this show was going to be hard to liveblog but this is pretty brutal. Hugs to all Eurovision fans around the world. Turns out this is not Hilversum\u2019s first Eurovision rodeo \u2013 the city hosted the contest in 1958, when Volare from earlier came third. This is all making me a bit emotional. I\u2019ve gone early. Our hosts for this evening are a very socially distanced Edsilia, Chantal and Jan, who were booked to present the grand final in Rotterdam this evening. Hopefully they\u2019ll be back for another go in Rotterdam next year. OK, on to round two, it\u2019s Europe Shine A Light! It\u2019s broadcast live from Hilversum in the north of the Netherlands \u2013 the Rotterdam Ahoy! venue that was intended for the event is now a Covid-19 hospital. In 12 years of writing about Eurovision that isn\u2019t something I ever imagined I\u2019d write, but these are the strangest of times. This show is being broadcast in 45 countries right now, which gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling that may also be wine. Graham is back! Well that was fun. Don\u2019t go away, we\u2019ve got another show along in a minute. Take a quick break to grab more snacks and booze, then come straight back for Europe Shine a Light. See you in a minute! Time to announce the results! If any of you voted for Fairytale or Gina G, you\u2019re barred from all future liveblogs. I love that Graham has a Tower Bridge backdown, like proper Eurovision voting. And the winner is\u2026ABBA. Of course it\u2019s Abba, it\u2019s always Abba. Time for more fans who\u2019ve raided the dressing up box, I love that they\u2019re doing Scooch. Would you like something to suck on for landing, sir? I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t get involved in this. Would have totally done some Keiino joiking. Time for a look at a few highlights from this year\u2019s entries, although don\u2019t expect the BBC to go big on this because that\u2019s pretty much the point of the next show. If I wanted to watch two identical TV shows I\u2019d watch any two episodes of Murder She Wrote. I think what what we\u2019ve learned from this segment is that we\u2019ve all been in lockdown too long. Because no TV show in 2020 is complete without some user-generated content, here\u2019s a montage of Eurovision fans recreating classic moments from the contest. It seems to include Andy Abraham playing a Dyson and Sonia being Lulu. OK I\u2019m loving the Russian grannies, this is joyfully bonkers. Time for Graham to have a chat with this year\u2019s UK entry that never was, James Newman. I really liked the song, and it was definitely a step in the right direction for getting us back on the left hand side of that leaderboard. Hopefully he\u2019ll be back next year. Also there was a brilliant documentary about this year\u2019s Eurovision made by BBC Newsbeat. It\u2019s on iPlayer now and it\u2019s really worth a watch. Green Screen Graham! The voting is open, but you only have 12 minutes! What\u2019s your favourite from that lot? It\u2019s a tough one, there are some great songs in there and plenty of other great ones that didn\u2019t make the Top 19. I think Waterloo will probably win it (it usually wins best Eurovision song votes, because it\u2019s the one everyone knows), although I\u2019d probably give my douze points to Conchita. And finally it\u2019s Katrina &amp; The Waves, singing \u2018Love Shine A Light\u2019. This was the last time the UK won the show, way back in 1997, and it\u2019s a fitting end to tonight\u2019s performances. We\u2019re going to see more of this song on the second show later, I think. Next up it\u2019s Alexander Rybak, singing \u2018Fairytale\u2019. This won for Norway in 2009, and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m still on a number of Norwegian most-wanted lists off the back of that liveblog. Eleven years on I\u2019ve mellowed considerably and can see why people liked it. Look, it\u2019s the best I can do right now. It\u2019s time for Conchita Wurst singing \u2018Rise Like A Phoenix\u2019 which won Eurovision for Austria in 2014. It\u2019s a brilliant, brilliant song, and the whole performance incredible. I saw Conchita live at the London Palladium a couple of years ago, she is an unstoppable goddess. Only four left! Next up it\u2019s Brotherhood of Man with \u2018Save Your Kisses for Me\u2019, which won for the UK in 1976. I was (only) three at the time, and hearing this song is one of my earliest childhood memories, although that could have been years later as it was in the charts for ever. Everyone up off the sofa to do the dance. Yes, even you. Drench yourself in Old Spice and Tramp and waggle those elbows. How do you follow that? Ah, with Netta\u2019s \u2018Toy\u2019, apparently. This won in 2018 for Israel; I didn\u2019t think it was as good as Fuego then, and I still don\u2019t now. That said, it was a brilliant bit of staging from Netta and when you\u2019ve had a bit too much to drink and have to pick from 25 songs that are a bit of blur, I can see why people might think \u2018I\u2019ll just vote for the one with the chicken noises.\u2019 Next up it\u2019s Domenico Modugno with \u2018Nel Blu Dipinto Di Blu\u2019. This song is better known as \u2018Volare\u2019, and even though it only came third in 1958, it went on to be a massive global hit and is possibly one of the best known Italian songs of all time. It\u2019s gorgeous. Now THIS is a great song. Lena won Eurovision for Germany with \u2018Satellite\u2019 in 2010, and it\u2019s three minutes of the kind of mockney cheerfulness we all need right now. This song walked so Kate Nash\u2019s \u2018Foundations\u2019 could run. It\u2019s time for Gina G with \u2018Ooh\u2026Aah\u2026Just A Little Bit\u2019 from 1996, when it came 8th. I mean, I can see why the panel picked this because it\u2019s perky and upbeat and Gina wears a proper bum-skimmer of a dress, but watching it now the performance was actually kind of terrible. Come on, it\u2019s true. Next up it\u2019s Lo\u00efc Nottet, with \u2018Rhythm Inside\u2019. I didn\u2019t vote for this because I\u2019d pretty much forgotten it existed, but I\u2019m pleased this made the shortlist because it\u2019s great. It came fourth in 2015, and the beady-eyed amongst you might recognise one of the backing singers as SuRie, who represented the UK in 2018. As Graham just mentioned, she wasn\u2019t allowed to vote for this. Time for Abba! Obviously Waterloo had to be included in this shortlist, marking first sighting of Abba for most of the world, and possibly the most famous Eurovision song of all time. It\u2019s also the last time anyone won Eurovision using a really tortured war metaphor, which is probably a good thing. Anyway they rocked up in monster platform boots, sang about Napoleon and the rest was (19th century military) history. Next up it\u2019s Mahmood from Italy singing \u2018Soldi\u2019. This was only last year, and another song that eventually came second (there\u2019s a few of them in this list). It\u2019s a great example of how Eurovision music isn\u2019t all la-la-la cheesy nonsense \u2013 Soldi was sung in Italian but had a bit of Arabic and some trap music influences that made it feel really cool and contemporary. I really love it. Song nine! Have a drink and raise a glass to Terry. No list of brilliant Eurovision songs would be complete without Verka Serduchka singing \u2018Dancing Lasha Tumbai\u2019. This came second for Ukraine in 2007 and inspired a million tinfoil Eurovision party costumes. It\u2019s camp and bonkers and joyful and I love it. If you\u2019re not bopping along to this you\u2019re dead inside. \u2018They\u2019re not the Eiffel Tower, let it go\u2019 Love Graham having a snipe at Baku. Time for Loreen, who won Eurovision for Sweden with \u2018Euphoria\u2019 in 2012. For reasons I can\u2019t remember I liveblogged that year from Stuart Heritage\u2019s house in Forest Hill, but I do recall us both having a dance around the room to this, making jokes about Claudia Winkleman and being pretty sure that it was going to win. It did, and it remains the quickest way to fill a dancefloor at a Eurovision party. Throw your hands in the air. UP UP UP UP UP UUUUUP. Time to go way back to 1965 for France Gall, who won with \u2018Poup\u00e9e de Cire, Poup\u00e9e de Son\u2019 for Luxembourg. France was only 17 when she won this, I think it translates along the lines of \u2018I\u2019m a wax doll, I\u2019m a singing doll\u2019, which feels a bit like a teenage cry for help from a girl with really pushy parents. Anyway it\u2019s a massive tune and absolutely deserves to be in this lineup. Oh YES, it\u2019s Eleni Foureira singing \u2018Fuego\u2019, which was the scene of an absolute ROBBERY for Cyprus in 2018. The world needs more sparkly catsuits and hairography, and this was a classic of the genre, but sadly it came second. I\u2019d love a Cyprus Eurovision one day; along with Malta, it scores top on the scatter graph of hot weather vs. cheap beer. Next up it\u2019s Bucks Fizz, who won for the UK in 1981 with \u2018Making Your Mind Up\u2019. I was 8 at the time and LOVED this song, although watching it now it\u2019s not entirely clear why. The vocal performance and staging was really quite patchy, although the skirt-ripping thing was cool. By 1981 standards, anyway - now it would get you a \u2018FIND THESE PERVERTS\u2019 post on Facebook. It\u2019s time for Dami Im to sing \u2018Sound of Silence\u2019, which won the jury vote for Australia in 2016, but then came fourth in the public vote and ended up second overall. Dami lost to Ukraine, who didn\u2019t win either vote; look, it was a really stressful and complicated voting year. Now is the opportunity to correct this injustice \u2013 feel free to award Dami bonus points for excellent plinth work, an enormous meringue of a dress and finding 42 different ways to pronounce the word \u2018silence.\u2019 Next up it\u2019s Dana International, singing \u2018Diva\u2019. This was the winner for Israel in 1998, which was the last time Eurovision was hosted in the UK, and a gamechanging year for Eurovision in lots of ways. It was absolutely on my shortlist, I love it. Viva la Diva 4eva. First up it\u2019s M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w singing \u2018Heroes\u2019. This won for Sweden in 2015, although if I\u2019d had a couple of drinks (which I have) I MIGHT argue that the song was fairly average and 2015\u2019s Eurovision was won by an animated stick man and a pair of leather trousers. Goodness, they\u2019re not messing about - this is Eurovision on speed. Time to start the shortlist of songs! Time to meet the jury panel! Oh how lovely, there\u2019s my stupid waving face. But hey, it\u2019s not every day I get to be the meat in a Mark De-Lisser/Mel Giedroyc sandwich. So the main focus of this show is to vote for the best Eurovision song of all time, from a shortlist of 19 pulled together by a panel of Eurovision experts. I use this term in the loosest possible sense because I\u2019m one of them. But on the upside, we get to revisit 19 brilliant performances with their original host nation postcards, and take a little trip down Eurovision memory lane. At the end the voting will open, and there will be some fun 2020 filler while they count the votes. It\u2019s all over in 90 minutes, which is my kind of Eurovision. And we\u2019re off! The Eurovision anthem (called Te Deum, fact fans) always gives me chills. Here\u2019s lovely Graham, who is driving the Eurovision replacement bus service this evening. Is everyone ready? I\u2019m ready *flexes fingers* Are we all enjoying Eurovision Pointless? I\u2019m rooting for Dana and SuRie. Although let\u2019s face it, John and Jade make a very beautiful couple. Evening all, and welcome to this year\u2019s Eurovision liveblog! Despite there being no actual contest this year, the BBC and the European Broadcasting Union have stepped up with an evening to celebrate this year\u2019s would-be contenders and 64 years of the world\u2019s biggest music event. I should be in Rotterdam right now, nursing dancing feet and a huge hangover, but instead I\u2019m here on my sofa in the UK following every minute of tonight\u2019s coverage. It\u2019s a bumper schedule on BBC One, kicking off at 6.25pm with Eurovision: Come Together, a celebration of Eurovision past and present put together by the BBC and presented by Graham Norton. After that we\u2019re being treated to Europe Shine a Light, a show produced by the EBU that is being shown in 45 countries this evening, plus loads more online. Both of these shows are being broadcast live, so I have a very limited idea of what the format is; please bear with me as I attempt to navigate all the musical glitter cannons. As I said, there\u2019s no official competition this year \u2013 it\u2019s just a joyous celebration of what would have been a brilliant Eurovision year. I\u2019m gutted for the contestants and fans that it\u2019s not happening, but we still have the music, we still have the performers and we still have the amazing Eurovision community around the world. It\u2019s a great opportunity to welcome the whole Eurovision family into our homes during a really tough time, so let\u2019s make the most of it \u2013 the comment box is open, so go ahead and sprinkle joy down below."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
