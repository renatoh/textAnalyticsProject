Although the question of the resilience of the financial services sector to withstand terror strikes paled into insignificance compared to the scale of human tragedy of the 7 July attacks, nonetheless it was a test for the business community and one which the City rose to well. At least that was the verdict of Sir Callum McCarthy, chairman of the Financial Services Authority. 'Information flowed smoothly between institutions, the FSA, the Bank of England and the Treasury,' he said. 'Back-up arrangements when they had to be used, worked; markets operated without interruption and accommodated high levels of trading.' But how well prepared are we as individuals in the face of terrorism or natural disasters? 'While a huge amount of work has been put into the aftermath of disasters to keep the financial systems running, the issue isn't just about business-preparedness,' comments Mike Grannatt, a former head of the Cabinet Office Civil Contingencies Secretariat. 'There is a challenge for people as well ... We become very fixed in our ways and get used to one way of organising our affairs. It is simple things that people might need to do like using cash machines to get their money out as opposed to going into branches or relying on the internet to do their banking.' The roof over your head In the event of some calamitous event - from bombs in the City to flash floods in Carlisle - the first port of call, after loved ones, will often be your insurer. How prepared is the high-street insurer to provide for the worst? 'We're in the business of disaster recovery and so we lead by example,' says David Ross of Norwich Union. 'If there were a disaster in which policyholders and we as an insurance company, lost all our records that, frankly, would be a fairly major disaster spread across a number of locations. If that were to happen, finding your insurance papers would be the least of our worries.' He points out that there are multiple copies of insurance polices held by Norwich Union that are 'backed up in an instant at different geographical locations'. So what happens if, as the floods subside, your house is totally washed out and you've lost everything? There is no central register of insurers and so, if you have lost your papers and can't recall your insurer, you are faced with a ring-round. 'Don't go back into a burning house to get your policy details, it is really straightforward to track down who you're insured with if we have your name or postcode,' Ross advises. During the Carlisle floods Halifax Home Insurance and Norwich Union proactively sent advisors to the homes of all their policy-holders. The Halifax, for example, will provide alternative accommodation if you can't move back into your house in the event of an 'insured incident' - including floods, storms, freezing pipes as well as 'terrorism damage resulting from fire or explosion'. Contact your insurer and you should be able to book yourself into a hotel or a B&amp;B and the insurer will pick up the bill directly. The money in your pocket What would it take to bring the banking systems to its knees? Unsurprisingly the high street banks are reluctant to go into specifics for the eminently sensible reason of not wanting to tip off the likes of al-Qaeda. 'Any disruption that the customers would see, even after a huge major disaster, would in all likelihood be minimal in virtually all circumstances. Plans have long been in place,' says Brian Capon of the British Bankers' Association. 'One branch being out of action doesn't mean that all the records on a particular client are not accessible because they are held centrally and if a branch does close down you can still run those accounts out of another sector.' A spokesman for one of the high street banks says that it would be near impossible for it to lose a client's details. 'We have two data centres in different parts of the country so we have a duplicate of everything,' he explains. 'In a situation where there's a problem with one centre we could transfer to another one pretty quickly. It's the kind of operation we do for maintenance anyway.' On 7 July a number of the bank's branches were closed down by the police in central London. 'It might have been that you had to wait until the following day to go to the bank but, let's face it, that's relatively small stuff in the convenience stakes,' he says. Civil contingencies expert Mike Grannatt agrees. 'It is true to say that the retail finance industry, such as the clearing banks, are probably ahead of many of the others in making sure they're resilient and those systems are tested,' he says. But would you still be able to take money out of the hole in the wall? 'There are some 55,000 cash machines in the UK and so, by and large, there is one near you,' points out Sandra Quinn of the Association for Payment Clearing Services. 'None of the people who load the machines are located in one place, all machines are backed up and linked to the same system.' Quinn explains that cash machines are autonomous insofar as 'if one machine down the road at the bank falls over it doesn't break down the system'. She adds, 'It stops but nothing else does.' Would you still get paid? Quinn points out that payroll systems should withstand whatever nature or terrorist cells throw at them. Most pay systems are operated through one of 40 bureaux, privately run services that are all accredited to input the data which leads to the money going into our accounts. 'Everyone has some sort of contingency process in place, and all bureaux will have back-up tapes,' she says. 'The absolute worst-case scenario is if a company is unable to collate new data for the new month for staff they would simply run last month's tape to avoid people not getting paid.' In your home Finally, how prepared are you? For a home-worker it doesn't take a terrorist cell to wreck a business. A power surge on the national grid can cause a computer to crash, and can lead to losing years of your work, family photos and email correspondence. According to a survey by the insurer AXA, some 46 per cent of small businesses have no plans to deal with the threats by terrorists, flash-floods or even staff sickness. 'If you work from home you should be OK as long as Aunt Ethel has a big enough garage for you to work in,' says Paul Dyer, managing director of Broker Continuity Planning which works with the Federation of Small Businesses to provide insurance to its members. 'But the key to business survival is all about IT and the ability to sustain your system in the event of a problem and to that extent most of us are woefully under-prepared,' he adds. Douglas Barnett, AXA's risk control and strategy manager, advises the following simple steps: \u00b7 compiling a list of clients in order of importance to contact should anything happen; and \u00b7 backing up your computer and keeping a copy of files at a relative's house 'or in the boot of your car' once a month. AXA provides its own business continuity guides for small businesses (www.axa4business.co.uk/bc/guide.asp) and the government-backed group London Prepared (www.londonprepared.gov.uk) offers a five-step guide to business continuity planning for smaller businesses. Paul Dyer says that, for home businesses, B&amp;Q is selling electricity generators. 'They are very nice and only cost about \u00a3150 each,' he says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
