Boxing is a richer sport for it", "bodyText": "One of the last people to wish Sonny Liston good luck before the start of the fight that brought the end of his reign as world heavyweight champion was a man in a dark suit and a stingy-brim hat who slipped out of the ring just before the referee called the fighters together at the Miami Beach Convention Centre on 25 February 1964. History, which not half an hour later would be rushing to acclaim the victory of Cassius Clay, little knowing that the era of Muhammad Ali had just begun, does not record the identity of the man in the hat. He was just one of the countless figures who slide in and out of the shadows that surround the sport of boxing, their motives often opaque. Had Mustafa Ameen not chosen to watch the fight between Amir Khan and Lamont Peterson in Washington DC last month from a ringside seat opposite the main television camera, the one that follows the boxers while the fight is in progress, he might well have clung on to a similar anonymity. Wearing a dark suit and a stingy-brim hat, Ameen was captured by the camera as he persistently leaned over the shoulder of the grey-haired man sitting next to him, who happened to be Michael Welsh, the nominated supervisor of the fight for the World Boxing Association, one of the two governing bodies whose titles were being contested. Ameen appeared to be talking to Welsh and pointing to \u2013 perhaps even touching \u2013 items that may have been round\u2011by\u2011round score slips, lying on the table in front of the WBA man. He was also sitting immediately in front of a small group consisting of Khan's father, manager and promoter, who wondered what the man was doing and, after the verdict had gone against them, brought his activities to their fighter's attention. They also noted that the man had climbed into the ring at the end to join the celebrations in Peterson's corner. Using Twitter, Khan alerted the world to their suspicions. The Man in the Hat and the suggestion of skulduggery made a great little story, particularly when Welsh declined to comment on the affair. Interlopers are not allowed to sit at ringside in proximity to officials, let alone interfere with their deliberations, and the plot was thickened by a reminder that there had been a highly unusual wait of 10 minutes from the end of the final round before the referee was able to announce a verdict, a points win for Peterson, that was strongly disputed by Khan and his supporters. It took a couple of days before the mystery man was identified as Ameen, an associate of the 23\u2011year\u2011old amateur heavyweight Michael Hunter, a hot prospect whose plans centre around an appearance in the colours of the United States at this summer's Olympics. On Monday Ameen told boxingscene.com that he had been around the fight game a long time, for some of it as business manager to Matthew Saad Muhammad, the former light heavyweight champion, and that he had visited England on a book tour with Muhammad Ali and Thomas Hauser, the boxing writer, some years ago. \"I'm not a mystery man at all,\" Ameen claimed, adding that he will be explaining his activities at next week's hearing in New York. I think I liked him better as a mystery, when his appearance reminded me of one of the things I like about boxing, which is its gallery of supporting players. \"Runyonesque\" is the traditional adjective for such characters, although there are those who will tell you that the great chronicler of the New York demi-monde was not averse to heightening reality. No one wants a return to the days when Joe Louis, cheated out of his winnings by crooks, was forced to scrape a living as a Las Vegas hotel greeter, or Liston could be owned, body and soul, by mobsters like Frankie Carbo and Blinky Palermo. But without its picaresque cast, boxing becomes much less attractive to the casual observer. In that sense, the fight game could do with a few more Mustafa Ameens. Bradman of the lanes and the $1m endorsement Ten-pin bowling is not generally a priority item in these pages. But who do you think was the first American sportsman to sign a million-dollar endorsement deal? Joe DiMaggio, perhaps? Arnold Palmer, maybe? Andre Agassi? Joe Montana? Michael Jordan? Tiger Woods, possibly? In fact it was Don Carter, known as \"Mr Bowling\", who died in Miami last week at the age of 85. Described in his Los Angeles Times obituary as \"the game's original superstar\", he took up the sport at the age of 13. After a dalliance with pro baseball, he returned to the world of strikes and spares at a time when it was about to undergo a spurt of post\u2011war popularity. He signed his $1m (\u00a3648,000) contract with Ebonite, the bowling-ball manufacturers, in 1964, and retired six years later, having bowled 13 perfect games in his career \u2013 meaning a score of 300 achieved through all 12 strikes possible in a game. Clearly the Bradman of the lanes. Betfair's regrettable moment While Voler La Vedette was in the process of winning the two o'clock race at Leopardstown on 28 December, a customer of the Betfair betting exchange was still taking \"in-play\" bets at 28-1. Plenty of punters saw their chance, placing wagers that should have seen them collect \u00a323m. Unfortunately the customer offering the odds turned out to have not \u00a3600m in his account, as Betfair believed, but something less than a grand. Claiming that the whole thing was caused by a software error, since rectified, Betfair declined to pay out and, being based offshore, are under no obligation to explain themselves further. Their chief executive described the affair as \"a regrettable customer and betting experience in this market\", which is a bit like calling the sinking of the Titanic a disappointing passenger experience. Even if I understood the science of modern betting, I'm not sure I'd have a much higher opinion of the people who promote it. Step on it, Andy \"I didn't take my foot off the gas,\" Andy Murray said at the weekend, talking to Radio 5 Live's Garry Richardson about his Brisbane win. Perhaps the penny has finally dropped. If so, maybe Ivan Lendl has already earned his money."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
