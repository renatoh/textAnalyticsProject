It was a disappointingly ordinary performance from a pianist who is such a dazzling interpreter of 20th-century repertoire, and though Bach obviously means a great deal to him, these performances of the first book of the 48 Preludes and Fugues suggest that he so far has not found a way of communicating that enthusiasm for the music in his performances. Technically, of course, his playing is immaculate; everything is clear, every rhythm precise, every texture perfectly balanced. What's missing is any character or warmth; there's certainly humour in some of the preludes, but none of that is evident in what become rather remorseless technical exercises, while the deliberate way in which Aimard defines each of the fugues, as though putting their subjects into quotation marks to make a didactic point, becomes rather wearing. When there are so many fine performances of this imperishable music of all vintages already available on disc, from Edwin Fischer right through to Peter Hill's recent Delphian set, this one can't be recommended."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
