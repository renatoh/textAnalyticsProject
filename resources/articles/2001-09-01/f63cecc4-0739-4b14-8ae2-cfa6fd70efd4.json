The klaxon-voiced crooner usually performs before audiences of thousands and sings Love Changes Everything, the 1989 Lloyd Webber hit with which he remains indelibly associated. But for this two-week run, his crowd can't top 250, and he has sworn not to sing anything that he has performed in public before. \"This is a change of direction,\" he says baldly. Ball doesn't just want to be housewives' choice now. He wants the rest of us to like him too. Part of the self-image of this informal show is that the two-men-one-piano formula constitutes nerve-racking self-exposure for a man more used to light-entertainment razzmatazz. Ball duly arrives on stage exaggerating nervous tension. \"No, don't look at me,\" he sings. \"You try something new, they wait for you to fail.\" He cheers himself up with Jiminy Cricket's Give a Little Whistle (from Pinocchio, a film hitherto unregarded by torch-song sophisticates). By the end of the medley, he's belting out, \"Yes, look at me. I'm glad I came.\" It's the least we expected of your solo show, Michael. A Ball novice, I'd have liked to find out more about the man himself. But there's no patter here, just songs, often artfully arranged by pianist Jason Carr. Not all of them are flattered by Ball's voice (say a little prayer for his rendition of Burt Bacharach's I Say a Little Prayer). But there are effective refits of Bowie's Life on Mars and - take a deep breath, Thom Yorke - Radiohead's Nice Dream. The curse of the show is Ball's habit, cruelly exposed at the Donmar, of overloading each song with emotion. It's a West End, musical theatre tic: trying to dictate our response to the songs rather than letting them speak for themselves. I've Got No Strings buckles under the pressure, and he animates a later series of tragic ballads with a breast-beating angst that seems ridiculous in this intimate space. I'd rather he simply shared with us the pleasure he takes in singing, and spared us the false emoting. On the evidence of the steamrolling medley of showtunes with which he kickstarts the second act (a brief snatch of Love Changes Everything here to stop the crowd's collective heart), his telegraphed soulfulness won't woo the new audiences that he's after, but his talent might. \u0095 Until September 29.
