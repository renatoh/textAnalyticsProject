Simon Moran, the music promoter who is Warrington's majority shareholder, holds the key to Cullen's future and was at the post-match press conference to hear the coach admit his position is \"uncomfortable\". His contract is up at the end of the season and no new deal has been offered. \"First 40 good enough and second 40 not,\" Cullen said when asked what had gone wrong. Indeed, heads dropped when Saints took the lead in the 48th minute with the first of three tries for Leon Pryce as 34 unanswered points took the visitors back above Leeds. Henry Fa'afili had set up the position for Vinnie Anderson's opening try for Warrington and finished the second himself with a diving catch from Lee Briers' chip. But Matty Smith brought Saints level three minutes into the second half, then Pryce took a long pass from Jon Wilkin to stride 40 metres to the corner. Briers gifted Pryce his second and the stand-off shrugged off Adrian Morley's attempted tackle and dummied the full-back Brent Grose with ease for his hat-trick. Ade Gardner and Maurie Fa'asavalu also scored. Warrington Wolves Grose; Fa'afili, Martin Gleeson, Johnson, Barnett; Anderson, Briers; Wood, Clarke, Leikvoll, Westwood, Morley, Wainwright. Interchange: Mark Gleeson, Parker, Bracek, Harrison. St Helens Wellens; McGilvray, Gidley, Gilmour, Gardner; Pryce, Smith; Cayless, Roby, Graham, Wilkin, Sculthorpe, Clough. Interchange: Cunningham, Hargreaves, Fa'asavalu, Tyrer. Referee R Silverwood (Mirfield)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
