Directed by Clint Eastwood, American Sniper has been described as \u201ca heartfelt salute to US muscle\u201d \u2013 but its star and producer, Bradley Cooper, denies that it\u2019s a political film. \u201cIt\u2019s not a movie about the Iraq war; it\u2019s about the horror of what something that a soldier like Chris has to go through,\u201d Cooper said at a press conference in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s not a political movie at all, it\u2019s a movie about a man \u2013 a character study. We hope that you can have your eyes opened to the struggle of the soldier rather than the specifics of the war.\u201d Cooper was speaking alongside co-star Sienna Miller; the film\u2019s writer, Jason Hall, and Taya Kyle, Chris\u2019s widow. Having completed four tours of duty and overcome his struggles to readjust to domestic life \u2013 events detailed in the film \u2013 in 2013 the Navy Seal was killed by a fellow veteran he was attempting to mentor on a shooting range. When asked how audiences in other countries, who may have a more ambivalent view than the film about America\u2019s role in Iraq, would receive American Sniper, Taya Kyle, played by Miller in the film, said: \u201cLess than 1% of our men and women sign up to serve this country. They\u2019re there because they\u2019re willing to put their life on the line for this country. There\u2019s an inaccurate stereotype that these guys love war and they don\u2019t \u2013 they love the fight for what they would say is justice or each other.\u201d The opening of the film depicts Kyle killing a pubescent boy and his mother as they attempt to throw a grenade at American marines. \u201cThe woman forced him into a situation where he had to make a choice,\u201d said Taya of the incident. \u201cEither he lets these marines die or he swallows his heart and says I\u2019ve got to do this. It hurt him, but either he does it or someone else has to get on the gun.\u201d Pointing out that soldiers in the US military do not choose who they fight, and struggling to contain her emotions, Taya continued: \u201cIt is a misconception to think that the Americans are over there fighting Iraqis. They\u2019re fighting terrorists. They just have to fight the people that are coming at them \u2013 it\u2019s not about politics for the soldiers at all.\u201d Such a view will, however, be seen by many as deeply political, along with the film itself, which is told entirely from Kyle\u2019s point of view, with few speaking roles for non-white characters. Deliberately structured like a western, American Sniper\u2019s climax pits Kyle against Mustafa, an Iraqi sniper who does not utter a single word throughout the entire film. The Hollywood Reporter has already suggested that American Sniper may be overlooked for a best picture nomination at the Oscars owing to most of the voters being left-leaning, quoting an unnamed film insider as saying \u201cthese red-state, red-bait movies have got to appeal to LA and New York \u2014 and that\u2019s going to be tough ... This lefty crowd isn\u2019t going to gather around a Navy Seal best known for killing people.\u201d Though Eastwood\u2019s politics have been hard to pin down \u2013 in 2012 he gave a bizarre address to an empty chair intended to represent Obama at the Republican National convention \u2013 American Sniper is a much more avowedly patriotic, even bellicose, film than his previous Oscars-winners, Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby; a more reassuring watch in an America spooked by Isis. When asked whether this is was the kind of film America now requires, Taya Kyle, who has a foundation which provides marriage counselling for veterans, replied that the film would help people to raise awareness of the challenges soldiers face on and off the battlefield. \u201cHopefully we will get some benefit in people wanting to do more for [the military].\u201d Said Cooper: \u201cWe would never have the audacity to say that this movie is what America needs All we tried to do is portray this man as honestly as possible. We found this to be a very compelling story and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s not didactic - it\u2019s very simple in its purpose.\u201d Yet other viewers \u2013 especially beyond America \u2013 seem sure to disagree. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 December 2014 as Chris Kyle\u2019s surname was incorrect in places. This article was further amended on 7 January 2015 to correct the spelling of Kaya Kyle\u2019s name."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
