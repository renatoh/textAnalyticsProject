Around the country, Australians have been told to cancel trips and stay at home. Even family gatherings, and gatherings of more than two people, are banned. In Tasmania, police will use helicopters to spot people travelling on the roads, while in New South Wales, even the state arts minister, Don Harwin, could be fined $1,000 for moving to his holiday house. New South Wales Police will use number plate recognition technology and stake out caravan parks and highways to catch people potentially travelling for holidays. The police commissioner, Mick Fuller, said he would be deploying additional police to the north coast especially, and that \u201cfrom Friday onwards, we\u2019ll be issuing tickets, particularly for those not from New South Wales\u201d. Queensland Police set up a surprise checkpoint at the Port of Brisbane ferry terminal on Thursday, turning away masses of people trying to head to Moreton Bay for a holiday. Over the weekend, police on the Gold Coast will flood the M1\u2019s southbound lane, scanning licence plates to catch people registered from further north. The district\u2019s chief superintendent, Mark Wheeler, said people would be pulled over, questioned and potentially fined if they were holidaying and not travelling for an essential reason. \u201cWe can easily check while we\u2019re driving where a car is registered to,\u201d he told the Gold Coast Bulletin. \u201cEveryone in that vehicle has made that conscious decision to do non-essential travel, so we would certainly consider to issue fines for everyone in that car, not just the driver.\u201d And even those not pulled over could have their plates scanned, and then be investigated and fined later, he said. On top of that, all Queenslanders have been warned that if they head south into NSW, they will need a border pass to get back in. Earlier in the week, police also confirmed they would be investigating a flood of applications to try to become residents of Stradbroke Island \u2013 so they could holiday there. More than 300 people had applied in a week to become residents of the popular holiday destination. The state\u2019s disaster coordinator and deputy police commissioner, Steve Gollschewski, said police would be looking into it. \u201cIt\u2019s not a game to work out how you can game the system and go to your holiday home on Straddie,\u201d he said. Victoria The police minister, Lisa Neville, said on Thursday that police will crack down on holiday travel. Visiting family for social reasons is already banned in the state, and police will also be out issuing fines to people who travel an excessive distance for exercise or recreation. \u201cTravelling from Melbourne to Lorne to surf is inappropriate,\u201d Neville said. \u201cYou can\u2019t go to an Airbnb, you can\u2019t camp, you can\u2019t caravan, you can\u2019t boat, you can\u2019t fish. You can\u2019t catch up with friends or family that don\u2019t currently live with you.\u201d On Wednesday, Victoria Police issued fines to two men because they were in a car watching a movie in a public place, six people who claimed they were \u201cjust chilling\u201d, four people who were \u201cdriving around aimlessly\u201d and to a man who said he drove from Wantirna South to South Melbourne \u2013 just under 40km \u2013 to buy a bottle of water. Tasmania Helicopters will be flown over Tasmania, keeping an eye on people travelling for holidays. There will also be an increased police presence in the state\u2019s northwest, where a quarter of the state\u2019s current cases are located. The premier, Peter Gutwein, said on Thursday that \u201cthe gloves [would] come off\u201d for Easter. \u201cWe are going to police this \u2026 If you go to a shack and you don\u2019t have a reasonable excuse to be there, you will be asked to leave. If you don\u2019t, you will be summonsed and charged.\u201d Western Australia Beaches could be shut over the Easter weekend as the weather seems set to bring record-breaking heat. Maximums of 36C are forecast for Perth on Good Friday and Saturday, prompting police to warn that they will be patrolling beaches. Going to the beach is allowed, the police commissioner, Chris Dawson, said, as long as you maintain physical distancing and do not travel unnecessarily to get there. \u201cWhat we are saying is don\u2019t drive away from your home on holidays,\u201d he said. \u201cBut yes, you are allowed to go out and exercise. Yes, you are allowed to go to the beach.\u201d However, the deputy commissioner, Gary Dreibergs, was blunt: \u201cIf you want to go to the beach, go, have a swim, pack up your towel, go back to your car, head home,\u201d he said. Local councils are standing by ready to close the beaches if they get too crowded. The WA health minister, Roger Cook, said that \u201cobviously closing the beach is an option. [But] it\u2019s the very last option \u2013 we just simply want people to be doing the right thing.\u201d South Australia Police will also be patrolling holiday areas in SA, according to the commissioner, Grant Stevens. \u201cSome of these holiday destinations have communities in an older age bracket and those older people are concerned about this,\u201d he said. Australian Capital Territory Police will be out at the ACT\u2019s border crossings into NSW, but there will not be any hard checkpoints or roadblocks. Police will also patrol near Namadgi national park, according to the ACT police commissioner, Ray Johnson. And on the NSW south coast, NSW police have said they will be targeting ACT licence plates to stop holidayers travelling to their usual destinations. Northern Territory The police commander Tony Fuller has told Territorians to stay at home over Easter. \u201cThe NT is the only jurisdiction that hasn\u2019t had a death due to the virus and we want it to stay that way,\u201d he said in the NT police\u2019s official Easter message. \u201cMost parks are closed and fishing is only possible at certain spots. Police will be highly visible over the Easter weekend. If you are fishing in a boat it should only be with the people you are living with.\u201d Australian Associated Press contributed to this report"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
