They are not the only people who, having achieved their objective, will grab a bit of the very thing they have come to see and take it home with them. Stonehenge has always been in grave danger of being carried away piecemeal by the British. Bits of Uluru, known for a tiny part of its long history as Ayers Rock, are now being returned from all over the world to the management of the Kata Tjuta national park. Most come with a note saying simply \"Sorry\", but about a quarter of them allege that the stolen rocks have brought them bad luck. Jasmine Foxlee, a graduate student at the University of Western Sydney, who has been studying the phenomenon, told an Australian newspaper this week that some of these people send back the stones in the hope of warding off future catastrophe, as if Aboriginal spirituality were a sub-class of voodoo. Uluru is one of the holiest places in the world. No man-made shrine approaches anything like its sublimity, and yet visitors insist on climbing it. To make this unimaginably ancient and wonderful thing pass beneath your feet is to behave as sacrilegiously as if you were to haul yourself up the dome of St Peter's Basilica with alpenstock and crampons. And yet tourists do it, and a line of steel posts with chain strung between them has been installed to help them do it. After 500 million years or so of unassailed integrity, the rock has had holes drilled into it, holes where water can freeze on cold desert nights, and bust the sandstone apart. The climb is steep and can be slippery. The sun is merciless. So far, 35 people have died on the rock. Each death represents a catastrophic desecration which the traditional owners are powerless to reverse. It is not the thieves who are punished by bad luck when Uluru is desecrated but the Anangu people, for whom the cash revenue from tourism has been lethal. If grace and meaning are to be restored to their lives, Uluru must be cleansed and healed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
