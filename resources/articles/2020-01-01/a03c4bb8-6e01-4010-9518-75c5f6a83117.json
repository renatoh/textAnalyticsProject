Asked about Kean\u2019s call for the federal government to abandon its use of Kyoto carryover credits to meet its 2030 emissions target, Morrison told ABC\u2019s AM that \u201cMatt Kean doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about, he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in the federal cabinet [and] most of the federal cabinet wouldn\u2019t even know who Matt Kean was\u201d. \u201cWe are dealing with our climate policies in the same way as we took them to the election \u2026 we will meet and beat our emission reduction targets,\u201d Morrison said. At a press conference in Canberra, Morrison told reporters he did not regret the remarks. Morrison said although the government will review the possibility of reaching zero emissions by 2050, in line with its Pacific Island Forum commitment, it would not adopt the target if it \u201cdidn\u2019t know the cost\u201d. The treasurer Josh Frydenberg backed Morrison\u2019s position, by saying Kean was \u201cwrong\u201d to say cabinet ministers want the government to do more on climate change. After an unprecedented summer season of bushfires which Kean and even Morrison himself have conceded is caused in part by climate change, the federal government is under pressure to do more to fight global heating. At the 2019 election a record number of voters nominated climate change or the environment as their top concern. Morrison has suggested the Coalition could go \u201ceven further\u201d than the target of 26-28% emissions reduction by 2030, which was met with a chorus of approval from moderate Liberals but sparked warnings of negative consequences for Morrison by conservative Liberals and Nationals MPs. On Monday, Morrison denied that federal Liberals were pushing to increase emissions reduction ambition, telling broadcaster Sabra Lane that \u201cwhat is being suggested by your question is that there are others [who want a stronger policy] \u2013 that just isn\u2019t the case\u201d. \u201cThe government is completely united on focusing on the challenge of the response to the current bushfire crisis and meeting and beating our emissions reduction targets and taking our climate policies forward over the next term of government.\u201d Morrison said the government was still aiming for a 26% emission reduction, and noted that while the government had a target, \u201cI can\u2019t say that for everyone else\u201d \u2013 a reference to the fact Labor will announce its target closer to the next election. Morrison ruled out a carbon tax, increasing electricity prices and \u201c[wiping] out resource industries\u201d. Morrison told 3AW Radio he had \u201cno idea\u201d if Labor will aim for zero carbon emissions by 2050 but acknowledged that \u201cwe undertook to look at that through the Pacific Islands Forum commitment I gave last year\u201d. \u201cBut we need to understand what that means \u2013 I mean, people can say that, but what does that mean for jobs? Now I can\u2019t answer that question right now \u2026 But I\u2019m concerned it wouldn\u2019t be a good thing. \u201cPeople who make these commitments need to be able to tell people what it will cost them.\u201d The Pacific Island Forum\u2019s communique committed Australia and other Pacific countries to produce a 2050 strategy by 2020 which \u201cmay include commitments and strategies to achieve net zero carbon by 2050\u201d. The federal Liberal MPs pushing for change include Katie Allen, who has said the government is \u201cstarting to move in the right direction but we have a lot more to do\u201d, and Dave Sharma and Tim Wilson, who both welcomed Morrison\u2019s comments last week on the need to \u201cevolve\u201d policy. On Sunday Anthony Albanese promised that Labor would \u201ctake climate change seriously\u201d and have a \u201cvery strong\u201d policy that aimed to be \u201cas ambitious as possible\u201d but did not commit to outbid the Coalition because he hoped the Morrison government would take action before the next election. Albanese confirmed that a 45% reduction target by 2030 is no longer Labor policy and described it as a \u201cmistake\u201d that Labor automatically maintained that target from the 2016 to 2019 election without further shadow cabinet reconsideration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
