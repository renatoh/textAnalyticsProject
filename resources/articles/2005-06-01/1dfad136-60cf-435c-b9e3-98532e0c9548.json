With the opening of the John Hansard gallery, at Southampton University, at the end of the decade, he established one of Britain's foremost exhibition spaces. He went on to become a prime mover in two distinctive explorations of the environment with photography at their core. Stable first set up a gallery on the staircase leading to the vice chancellor's rooms at Southampton in 1973, when he was working in the secretary and registrar's department. This personal initiative arose from his interest in contemporary photography: he saw its documentary emphasis as a way of tackling social issues, which, in turn, offered possibilities for dialogue and discussion within the university. Having established its presence through outreach work, the gallery - the first of its kind in a British university, and one of only four in the UK - quickly became a meeting point for photographers, students, staff and art lovers from far afield. Stable's enthusiasm, friendliness, humour and interest in new ideas meant that people wanted to work with him. And he made things happen - often at his own expense, such as the time when he took two years' unpaid leave, betwen 1975 and 1977, in order to concentrate on developing the gallery's programme of exhibitions, lectures, school workshops and fellowships. Through his efforts, the gallery moved in 1980 to a campus building that had previously housed a giant tidal model of the Solent. It opened as the John Hansard gallery, taking its name from a university benefactor who had died the previous year, a descendant of the printer who gave his name to the published proceedings of the House of Commons. This new home for the contemporary visual arts incorporated both Stable's photographic gallery and the university's fine art gallery. Stable became the first director of the combined whole, but much to his regret was compelled to resign in 1981, after having to take several months to recover from an accident in the gallery. His creation still thrives today and, with the university's Nuffield theatre and Turner Sims concert hall, forms an arts complex exceptional among British universities. Stable was born in Oswald-twistle, near Accrington, in Lancashire. He was orphaned when very young, and brought up by his grandmother in Barrow-in-Furness. Educated at Barrow grammar school for boys, he took a degree in French, Spanish and economics at Sheffield University (1951-54) before going on to study Russian at the Joint Services School for Linguists. He completed his national service in Berlin as a signals interceptor. On returning to Britain, he worked briefly for the biscuit manufacturers Huntley &amp; Palmers in Reading, but soon realised that commerce was not for him, and joined the agricultural economics department of Reading University as a researcher. From there, he moved to St Andrews University and, in 1964, to Southampton. After leaving the university, he worked as a picture framer, though reluctantly. Then, in 1990, he was invited to work on the Cross Channel Photography Mission (CCPM), a project set up by Kent county council and South-East Arts to record, through photography, the social, cultural and environmental changes brought about by the building of the Channel tunnel. He tackled this enterprise with typical energy and insight, and among the impressive range of photographers he commissioned were Peter Kennard, Anna Fox and Catherine Gfeller, from Switzerland. The CCPM became an independent photography organisation and continues today as Photoworks. Stable's final initiative, launched in 1999, was The Road, an extraordinary multi-faceted research project to study the built environment as an influence on, and indicator of, change in people's lifestyles. It brought together a Spanish photographer, Mar Mateo, and an array of creative collaborators and organisations - graphic design students, a writer, members of an environmental design consultancy, Southampton University's oral history unit and the Southampton Institute - to work with the residents of a small, Victorian inner-city street. Earlier this year, it culminated in the publication of a book and CD by the Southampton Institute. Stable is survived by his wife Yvonne and their two daughters, Lucy and Emma. \u00b7 Lionel 'Leo' Stable, arts administrator, born March 20 1933; died April 16 2005"}, "isHosted": false}}}
