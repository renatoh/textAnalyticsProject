The convent I was sent to had 20 nuns, with an average age of 33. Those were very different times: communities nowadays are much smaller and live in accommodation suited to the circumstances, in groups of two, three or four, in houses or flats. We no longer wear a habit but dress in the original purple of our order, St Augustine. But the tradition is the same: we hold together in prayer and activity. The glue is praying together: morning, midday, evening and night. There are four of us in our community: I\u2019m the eldest and the youngest is 45. Jess and I have known each other for years, but we hadn\u2019t lived together until three years ago. We\u2019ve got a lot in common. We both love poetry, and we tend to be on the same wavelength. Sister Jessica Gatty, 80 We live in a lovely, spacious house with a big garden and I do sometimes think: where\u2019s the poverty in this? But poverty is also about sharing. We invite students from the university nearby to have meals with us once a week, and we are careful not to waste food. We are very ecologically aware \u2013 we have solar panels. There is a rota for cooking and we try to eat supper together every evening. We all have roles outside the community \u2013 we\u2019re trustees of charities, for example, and one member teaches English to a Syrian family \u2013 but we try to be more than ships in the night. Christine and I are very keen on current affairs: we\u2019re glued to the evening news. Our conversations tend not to be frivolous, but we\u2019re not too serious. We make sure we have fun as well. \u2022 If you have a story to tell about who you live with, fill in this form and tell us a little about your set-up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
