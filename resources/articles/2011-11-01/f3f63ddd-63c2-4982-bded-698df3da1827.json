That was despite being credited with getting the company back into shape after a period in the artistic doldrums, and nurturing some excellent dancers. Now, a new director has been appointed: Christopher Hampson. The Manchester-born Hampson danced with English National Ballet before working as a choreographer: he made work for ENB, Royal New Zealand Ballet and Ballet Black. The chair of Scottish Ballet, Zo\u00eb van Zwanenberg, said in a statement that Hampson has \"a clear understanding of what it means to lead a national company\" \u2013 which may be a slightly barbed reference to Page's enthusiasm for programming his own camply lavish postmodern works. My ballet spies tell me that Hampson is a much more straight-down-the-line tutus man. The appointment perhaps reflects the board's desire to create a company more concerned with creating \"proper\" classical work than was Page. Hampson, who has said he wants to bring \"an even wider commissioning vision and breadth of distinctive programming\" to the company, is to take over in August. Now act that in Mandarin In New York last week, I caught Chinglish, a new play by David Henry Hwang (author of M Butterfly). A drama about cultural confusion and the limits of language, it concerns an American entrepreneur who attempts, frequently haplessly, to do business in China. Fascinatingly, at least half the dialogue is in Mandarin (with surtitles). One of the leading roles is taken by Stephen Pucci, who plays a British resident in China acting as fixer for the American (Gary Wilmes). It must be the only role in theatre that demands a western actor switches seamlessly between English and Mandarin. Hats off then to this young Briton, who studied Chinese at Leeds University before going to drama school \u2013 and doubtless never dreamed his linguistic skills would come in handy on Broadway. Scent of a ballerina Lauren Cuthbertson, the young star of the Royal Ballet, this week told our dance critic Judith Mackrell that she chooses a signature perfume for each role. Further inquiry reveals it's Vera Wang for Sleeping Beauty Act III (\"very bridal\") and Annick Goutal's Petite Cherie for Alice (\"it smells like grass and fresh flowers \u2026 and it also seemed right for the trip through Wonderland\"). She's still \"sniffing out\" perfumes for her debut in the title role of Kenneth MacMillan's Manon this month, thinking about Bulgari's Jasmin Noir for the debauched Act II, set at a party of gamblers and demi-mondaines. If she wants to stick to jasmine, I'd suggest the even loucher Jasmin et Cigarette by Etat Libre d'Orange (which smells just how you'd think, of jasmine and cigarettes). Or, depending on her interpretation, Guerlain's this-side-of-slutty but definitely sexy Shalimar."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
