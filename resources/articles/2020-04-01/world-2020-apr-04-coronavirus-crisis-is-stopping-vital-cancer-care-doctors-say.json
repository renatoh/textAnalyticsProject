Leading oncologists have said that even those patients in category one and two priority, the highest for continuing treatment, are not receiving chemotherapy. The NHS said non-urgent operations would have to be put on hold so hospitals could focus on battling the Covid-19 pandemic, and NHS England guidance states that cancer services should continue to deliver care. However, it also calls for \u201clocal solutions to continue the proper management of these cancer services while protecting resources for the response to coronavirus\u201d. Prof Karol Sikora, the chief medical officer at Rutherford Health, which runs oncology centres, said the advice provided by NHS England around cancer was sensible but was being \u201cimplemented inconsistently\u201d around the country. \u201cThat is always the trouble \u2013 it becomes inconsistent, so people getting chemotherapy have now had it stopped even though they are category one and two patients, the highest priority. Also some hospitals have put blanket bans on cancer treatment for two to three weeks ... Not everyone needs to rush ahead with cancer treatment but others need to continue despite this to get the best long-term cure,\u201d he said. Sikora said: \u201cThe important thing here is people with curable cancer still get treatment. The private sector is in talks with NHS England and providers to provide increased capacity for NHS patients.\u201d The doctor said one of his close friends who worked in gastroenterology had got an email from a nurse saying \u201cnot to bother coming in\u201d and that his treatment would be \u201cstopped for the duration of the crisis\u201d. \u201cThe emotion is very difficult for our patients ... everything is uncertain,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a hard decision regarding how much you transfer care to coronavirus and how much say \u2018we have to keep going with vital non-urgent but critical services\u2019. The same is true of cardiac care.\u201d He said that there was the \u201clooming threat\u201d that cancer centres would close and all staff would go to the new Nightingale hospitals, built to take coronavirus patients from overstretched NHS facilities. \u201cI don\u2019t think that will happen. But there is concern that they will abandon all cancer patients. It would be sad if that happened.\u201d Angus George Dalgleish, a professor of oncology at St George\u2019s, University of London, said: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult. Coronavirus is having a devastating impact on how we deliver ordinary care \u2013 everything is out on hold or delayed.\u201d Asked whether this could mean more indirect deaths because of patients not getting care, Dalgleish said that \u201cwe won\u2019t know until it is all over\u201d. \u201cBut we are already seeing the effects of patients who are not going to get treatment. I heard today St George\u2019s is going to have nine wards full of coronavirus patients. They cannot do that without seriously impacting care of everyone else.\u201d Laura Lee, the chief executive of the cancer charity Maggie\u2019s, said anxieties among patients were being exacerbated by the current situation. She said: \u201cThe government needs to be more articulate about the issue, in the same way it has explored the effects of Covid on, for example, businesses and employment. In a sense, the plight of Covid isn\u2019t just with those who are going through Covid.\u201d She said that people had heard about the plight of those losing their jobs, but not about those with health conditions who would be affected by the virus, adding: \u201cThe unintended consequences or the non-choice consequences are coming.\u201d Dr Rosie Loftus, the joint chief medical officer at Macmillan Cancer Support, said that more than a quarter of calls to the charity\u2019s support line in the past week were from cancer patients concerned about Covid-19. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing from people who are feeling upset and scared, fretful about their future and even lonelier as a result of having to self-isolate,\u201d she said. \u201cWe recognise that these are exceptional circumstances for the NHS. It is vital that, across the UK, the NHS is assessing the impact of coronavirus on cancer treatment and care, and putting in place urgent plans to ensure that vital cancer services can still be delivered safely. Even in a time of crisis, decisions for cancer patients must be made according to an individual assessment of their need for critical care and treatment and their vulnerability to coronavirus.\u201d NHS England said in a letter issued to hospitals: \u201cEssential and urgent cancer treatments must continue. Cancer specialists should discuss with their patients whether it is riskier for them to undergo or to delay treatment at this time.\u201d It said that it had secured the use of almost all independent hospitals across England and their capacity should be used for cancer diagnosis and treatment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
