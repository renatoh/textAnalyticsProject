A seven wicket loss to Australia, a 34-run defeat by an unconvincing Sri Lanka, and now a seven wicket loss to a New Zealand side with a somewhat rusty Kane Williamson. The loss of Rashid Khan was always going to be too much of a hurdle to get over, especially when defending such a small total. There\u2019s no update as yet on his health after that crack on the helmet from Ferguson - but they\u2019ve got nearly a week till their next game, against the down-at-heel South Africans. On the plus side, Ramat Shah\u2019s part-time leg-spin produced a couple of smashing deliveries and Hashmatullah\u2019s fifty deserved more than a loss with 17 overs to spare. That\u2019s it from me, thanks for all your emails, sorry I didn\u2019t have time to put them all up or reply, enjoy your evening! Jimmy Neesham wins the man of the match award for his best bowling figures of five for 31 and New Zealand are top of the table, having played three and won three! So Black Caps - can the inconspicuous win the World Cup? Can Kane Williamson, a cooler head even than Eoin Morgan, carry the trophy home? Their next game against India is one for the diary. Fire and Ice. With a pull off Aftab Alam, Williamson wins the match! Williamson not out 79, Latham not out 13. 32nd over: New Zealand 172-3 (Williamson 79, Latham 13) Hamid Hassan does enough to ensure that there will be one more over. Scores are level. James is rubbing his fingers with glee at the thought of an international transfer to the County Ground at Northampton... As a Northants fan, I\u2019d love to see Rahmat Shah replacing Alex Wakely at 3 and bowling in \u2018spin-twin\u2019 tandem with Rob Keogh. Now that Afghanistan is a full test nation, there are no ECB rules stopping this from happening. Please forward this to Wantage Road! 31st over: New Zealand 168-3 (Williamson 77, Latham 11) Aftab Alam keeps it tight but they still drill six off the over. Easy pickings now. Abhijato Sensarma has been thinking, which he does a lot! All\u2019s well that ends well, but Kane Williamson has looked either too elegant or too scratchy in recent times. He can either get stuck into a rut, or play cuts and execute delicate dabs better than anyone else on the planet, depending on his mood when he comes out to bat. Is this bipolar touch syndrome temporary, or will it carry into the latter half of the World Cup as well? If it does, as a Kiwi fan I would feel blessed on the days he gets going, and a bit tentative on the days he doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s shouldering a lot of responsibility, so while the nerves of steel combined with the determination to stay out in the middle usually bode well, against attacking teams like England and India this strategy of batting slowly for a lonf time without an adequate acceleration might come back to bite him. Fingers crossed that he flicks on his switch to become the best batsman of this tournament once these warm-ups are done with! 30th over: New Zealand 162-3 (Williamson 74, Latham 8) Hamid Hassan pitches one a little full and Williamson cracks it through midwicket for four. Pitter-patter a few singles and New Zealand are nearly there. Their first three matches were against the less powerful sides, and they\u2019ve won them all. Job done. If not spectacularly. Now, for the nail-biters. 29th over: New Zealand 155-3 (Williamson 68, Latham 8) When all of a sudden two and two make four instead of 3.4869. Kane Williamson watches Gulbadin and sees a beach ball: back foot, front foot, pint point, fours. 28th over: New Zealand 143-3 (Williamson 57, Latham 5) Aftab knows that lbw appeal against Latham was out. His eyes, mouth and arms scream it. But no. The umpire humours him by explaining there was an inside edge. Saurya Chakrabort writes: Greetings! Over the last couple of years, I\u2019ve become hopelessly addicted to the OBO coverage, which I find provides a fantastic contrast to the ball-by-ball stuff from Cricinfo. Why thank you on behalf of my esteemed colleagues! Also, huge props to you for the fantastic County blog...the off-beat poetry BTL is some of the best one can ever come across. Aww you\u2019re too nice. It is a bit niche... Anyway, let me attempt a segue to the County game- apart from the established box office stars like Rashid Khan and Mohammed Nabi, do you see anyone else from the team being a valuable addition to a county side at present? Would love to know your insight on a specific player and a specific gap he could fill in a specific county side.That\u2019s too many specifics in one line. Specific away. Come on OBOers, your thoughts please. 27th over: New Zealand 141-3 (Williamson 57, Latham 5) Seven off Gulbadin\u2019s over with narry a dash of danger. Lawrie Taylor is not alone in thinking ahead. I n reply to Alistair\u2019s comment about NZ team effort, yes I think you are right they seem to be avoiding taking the lower order teams to the \u201ccleaners\u201d. Maybe their real test will be when they come up against the West Indies against whom Australia had to dig themselves out of a hole. 26th over: New Zealand 134-3 (Williamson 47, Latham 4) A blow for New Zealand, but one they should be able to take. Latham takes no prisoners, watches Aftab for a ball, and sends his next, another full-toss, straight back past the bowler for four. 39 needed. The ball after Taylor gets four from a misfield, Aftab gets his revenge. Taylor misses a full-toss and his off stump disappears. 25th over: New Zealand 124-2 (Williamson 47, Taylor 42) Nabi\u2019s first ball is launched by a smiling Taylor on to the roof of the Andy Caddick pavillion. Andy Caddick would not be smiling. At half-way, the shadows s-t-r-e-t-c-h across the playing surface and across Afghanistan\u2019s campaign. Williamson cuts, for two, and that\u2019s his fifty. Inelegant by his standards, unusually grafting, but he\u2019s on his way. 24th over: New Zealand 113-2 (Williamson 47, Taylor 35) Six off the over, Williamson biffs a Ramat Shah long-hop to the boundary as the midgies flap about Taunton and MC Hammer hits the tannoy. 23rd over: New Zealand 107-2 (Williamson 42, Taylor 34) Taylor throws a thick-edge past the keeper and down to the boundary. Slow and steady black-caps, slow and steady. 22nd over: New Zealand 101-2 (Williamson 42, Taylor 28) A handful of singles off Ramat. And an answer to Alistair\u2019s question: aren\u2019t New Zealand by nature no better than they have to be? Too chilled to be outrageous for the sake of it? This is just the warm-up. Isn\u2019t it? 21st over: New Zealand 97-2 (Williamson 40, Taylor 26) Gulbadin bowls a no ball because there aren\u2019t enough fielders in the circle and to make it worse, Williamson cracks him for four. Then more awkwardness from Williamson who is out of sorts, in the way that only class batsmen can be out of sorts. 20th over: New Zealand 89-2 (Williamson 33, Taylor 26) 19th over: New Zealand 89-2 (Williamson 33, Taylor 26) Ramat unleashes a cracking leggie which beats Taylor. Alistair writes from Lyon. Unpatriotic of me, but I have a sinking feeling that NZ are no better than they need to be. They will win the match, but they will make it look close, as against Bangladesh. They should have killed it in 20 overs, as they did with Sri Lanka. Higher risk, bigger rewards. Or are they hiding their light under a bushel, to fool the big boys? Discuss. 19th over: New Zealand 88-2 (Williamson 32, Taylor 26) Did I say Williamson was out of touch? Gulbadin sends one in a little short and Williamson pulls it for four like an irritated man with a point to prove. A couple looking thoroughly cold and wrapped up in blankets pop up on the TV. The shade on a chilly June late afternoon is not a good place to be. 18th over: New Zealand 81-2 (Williamson 27, Taylor 25) A comedy bit of fielding down in the deep by Hamid, who gets into position and then lets the ball run through his entire defence system to. A death-star like flaw. My ten year old helper tells me New Zealand\u2019s next game is against India on Thursday. 17th over: New Zealand 75-2 (Williamson 26, Taylor 20) Crowded house comes over the tannoy - bringing back happy memories of driving a camper van round New Zealand when we were over for my brother Sam\u2019s wedding. Well, I say driving - passengering, but in control of the CD player. Fat Freddy\u2019s drop too. Nice from Hassan, a good fast yorker that went under Taylor\u2019s bat. Williamson not looking his chilled, fluent self here. Ominously for whoever they play next, he\u2019s probably nudging himself back into form. 16th over: New Zealand 71-2 (Williamson 24, Taylor 20) Gulbadin looks about. Hmmm. Enter Rahmat Shah, a batsman with a sideline in legspin. Taylor edges his first ball through third man for four. But that is followed by five watchful dots. Well bowled! And that\u2019s drinks. 15th over: New Zealand 67-2 (Williamson 24, Taylor 16) Hamid Hassan returns, just three off the over. Romeo writes again, good to see someone\u2019s out there... Afghanistan need to play more in Britain/Ireland and the kind of conditions there if they\u2019re to be more competitive. Ireland and Scotland, both fine sides in themselves, will welcome them again, no doubt, as they have before, but when will England host them for a proper series? I hope it happens before I die but I\u2019m not confident. Maybe also New Zealand could have them over for a tour? 14th over: New Zealand 64-2 (Williamson 22, Taylor 15) Since the last World Cup, no finger spinner has taken more wickets than Nabi. And New Zealand fail to get him away again. Just three off the over. One of them a frankly terrible run there by Taylor and Williamson which leaves Williamson running to the danger end. But the throw isn\u2019t quite good enough from mid-wicket and he\u2019s safe. 13th over: New Zealand 61-2 (Williamson 21, Taylor 13) Taylor cuts - ooof -he\u2019s strong. A bit short, a bit wide, just how he likes it. Gulbadin is cross with himself. Net bowler hit by David Warner report: his CT scan is fine, and he\u2019s feeling good. He\u2019ll be kept in hospital for observation for a while. 12th over: New Zealand 56-2 (Williamson 21, Taylor 8) We have spin in the body of Mohammad Nabi, Mr Reliability. Sharp haircut; tall, too. Was that last ball the doosra? New Zealand watchful, wary. 11th over: New Zealand 52-2 (Williamson 20, Taylor 6) Gulbadin bustles like few others bustle.Ian Austin perhaps, or Steve Waugh. A maiden. 10th over: New Zealand 52-2 (Williamson 20, Taylor 6) Another super over from Aftab - an lbw appeal against Taylor and a Williamson slice that just falls short of midwicket. In between Taylor slaps a big beautiful pull to the boundary. End of the power play. New Zealand have nine runs fewer and have lost two more wickets than Afghanistan at the same stage. 9th over: New Zealand 46-2 (Williamson 19, Taylor 1) Williamson cracks Gulbadin for four. Two balls later, Gulbadin sends one past Williamson\u2019s outside edge. It doesn\u2019t look out. The 18 year old wicket-keeper looks unconvinced . The umpire says not out. But Gulbadin is sure! Ultra-edge says no, no, no. Gulbadin has now wasted two reviews - one when he was batting, one when he was bowling. There must be a word for that. Rashid Khan news: he will play no further part in the match. A precautionary decision. 8th over: New Zealand 41-2 (Williamson 15, Taylor 0) Is this getting interesting? If one of these two gets out it might be. Silly shot really there from Munro. Aftab only in his second ODI has a double-strike. Munro upper-cuts, but down on the third man boundary Hamid is waiting, and catches it soundly down on his knees. 7th over: New Zealand 39-1 (Williamson 14, Munro 21) Gulbadin takes the ball. No headband here. But the same accuracy. Afghanistan have a slip for Kane Willamson, who then, to the last ball of the over,a fractionally wider one, sways onto the back foot and, head text-bookishly arranged over the bat, drives him away for four. 6th over: New Zealand 34-1 (Williamson 10, Munro 20) A big hand here for Afghanistan\u2019s seamers. Keeping it tight, keeping it on the imaginary tuppence located in that secret bowling sweet spot. Kane Williamson does sneak a boundary, an inside edge, which misses the stumps and carries on its merry way down to the boundary. To Hassan, the honours. 5th over: New Zealand 28-1 (Williamson 6, Munro 19) Aftab\u2019s chain is good and chunky, and only two runs come off that over - working his angles, keeping the batsmen guessing. Romeo writes in, hoping that Rashid Khan will be allowed to rest. I hope they don\u2019t let Rashid come out (in fact I\u2019m sure they won\u2019t). They will miss Dawlat, but Hamid and Aftab will do fine, and Ikram is a proper wicketkeeper and very talented. Game on! 4th over: New Zealand 26-1 (Williamson 5, Munro 18) Hassan, face adorned with black warpaint, headband ready, races in and Munro, foxed, edges him down to third man. But Munro is hungry. To the fifth ball, squarely confident, he drives him square for four. 3rd over: New Zealand 20-1 (Williamson 4, Munro 13) Munro pushes Aftab down the ground with such timing that\u2019s its at the boundary before you can say Quantocks. Williamson then waves Aftab away mid approach, but when the ball finally arrives just lobs him away, content to play his favoured anchor role. 2nd over: New Zealand 14-1 (Williamson 4, Munro 9) A good over from Hassan - just a couple of singles and a wide. Angus Fraser was curious enough to ask about his availability for Middlesex a while ago. Feeling slightly over-full after spending the morning making brownies and the afternoon eating them at my daughter\u2019s club\u2019s fund-raiser. I recommend Mary Berry\u2019s easy receipe. Put it all in a bowl and mix it together. Do let me know what you\u2019ve been up to. 1st over: New Zealand 11-1 (Williamson 2, Munro 0) Munro doesn\u2019t hang about, two fours - a slash though the covers, a power-push down the ground. They\u2019ll laugh off that early wicket - won\u2019t they? News on Rashid Khan after that bang on the helmet. He is not on the field, he\u2019s failed his first concussion test. They\u2019ll give him another one in 45 minutes. The headband warrior gets a breakthrough with the very first ball of the innings! An inside edge onto his pad which loops up to backward point. Taunton is looking gorgeous by the way. Hope the crowd, which looks good on the telly at least, get some thing like a match here. As a county cricket media officer said to me last week, \u201cI like Somerset. A proper club that does things properly.\u201d Ah, here come the players - Guptill and Munro for New Zealand. Everyone\u2019s favourite minnow (are they still minnows?) against everyone\u2019s second team. Aftab Alam takes the first over. Thank you Tim, my first proper boss and how lucky I was! He even paid me a small sum for work experience- back in 1997 - which was unusual to say the least, but just the way it should be. Enough now of the love-in, how about this game? Afghanistan will be disappointed with their final total after being 61-0 off the first ten. But, thanks to that last hit-a-long from Hashmatullah, they have a (small) chance. So long as Rashid Khan isn\u2019t too hurt after being hit on the helmet. News to follow. Pommie Mbangwa is looking at the pitch. He thinks the New Zealanders will enjoy themselves here. Ian Smith, Simon Doull and Mark Nicholas are all in matching blue suits, some, it has to be said, cut tighter than others. That was a strange innings. What\u2019s the Afghan idiom for the curate\u2019s egg? They started superbly, racing to 66-0 off 64 balls as Hazratullah roared and Noor Ali purred. Then they collapsed, perhaps on the basis of when in England, do as the English do. But in between the showers they showed some fight, even though the pitch had quickened up and the New Zealanders were suddenly fancying themselves as the West Indians of the Seventies. Jimmy Neesham picked up a five-for, though to my eye Lockie Ferguson was even better. One of these days, we will realise that NZ should be right up there among the favourites for this World Cup. That\u2019s it from me \u2013 it\u2019ll be Tanya Aldred, The Guardian\u2019s queen of the county scene, to see you through. I remember when she was just the work-experience kid at Wisden. Thanks for your company, your emails, and your geological bibliography. That\u2019s that! Hashmatullah has a flail at Ferguson, whose pace carries the ball to third man, where Henry takes a sharp tumbling catch as his shades fly off towards fine leg. So Hashmatullah finally departs for 59 off 99 balls, Ferguson has 4 for 37, and NZ have to get 173 to maintain their 100-per-cent record. It should be a cakewalk, but you never know. \u201cThere is no Afghan commentator on the ICC/Sunset+Vine roster,\u201d says Romeo, darkly. \u201cWhy not? Every other team has at least one and many have loads. There is something wrong here.\u201d 41st over: Afghanistan 172-9 (Hashmatullah 59, Hassan 7) Hashmatullah has been shepherding Hassan, shielding him from the strike and giving him little lectures, but now he leaves him to face five balls from Boult and Hassan is up to the task. 40th over: Afghanistan 171-9 (Hashmatullah 58, Hassan 7) Against the odds, these two are hanging in there. Edmund King has waited two hours for an answer to his question about geology books (15:22), but then what\u2019s two hours in 66 million years? And now we have one. \u201cMy wife still has a few geology/Earth Sciences books from her student days, which I\u2019ve dug out,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cThey are fairly dated by now\u201d \u2013 is that a joke? \u2013 \u201cbut there might be later editions: 1) The Story of the Earth by Patrick Moore and Peter Cattermole; 2) The Inacessible Earth by G. C. Brown and A.E. Mussett; 3) Mineralogy for students by M.H. Battey. Good fossicking!\u201d I\u2019m just wondering which one you\u2019ve made up. 39th over: Afghanistan 168-9 (Hashmatullah 56, Hassan 6) A few dots, and then Hashmatullah spots Boult\u2019s yorker, actually a full toss, and plays a very classy clip to deep square leg\u2019s right. That went off the bat so fast that you rather fear for the Afghanis if Guptill gets going. 38th over: Afghanistan 163-9 (Hashmatullah 51, Hassan 6) Ferguson tries a yorker and Hashmatullah is equal to it, digging it out so well that he gets four to long-on, and completing a fine fighting fifty off 84 balls. It\u2019s largely thanks to him that Afghanistan are still out there. 37th over: Afghanistan 158-9 (Hashmatullah 46, Hassan 6) While all this has been happening, Hashmatullah has been up the other end, like a teenager at a wedding, lurking in the corner and hoping you won\u2019t realise that he\u2019s there with his parents. Facing Boult, he picks up four off a top-edged hook. 36th over: Afghanistan 153-9 (Hashmatullah 41, Hassan 6) Do Afghanistan bat all the way down? Hamid Hassan comes in, plays a very classy on-drive for four, and moves to six off two balls. For the Afghanis, it\u2019s a funny young game. \u201cAfghan Harrow cut?\u201d wonders Peter Rowntree. \u201cHow about a Kyber chop?\u201d Nice one. Live by the slog, die by the slog. Aftab slaps a short ball into the clouds and Tom Latham does a good job of motoring into no-man\u2019s-land, waiting several minutes, and not letting the ball bounce out of his gloves as it returns to earth\u2019s orbit. 35th over: Afghanistan 139-8 (Hashmatullah 41, Aftab 6) Aftab is approaching the task the way Darren Gough once did, as if the crowd had all come to see him bat. Sometimes he even connects with the ball. Meanwhile, in Cardiff, England have taken a couple of quick wickets, but Shakib al Hasan has a hundred. 34th over: Afghanistan 135-8 (Hashmatullah 39, Aftab 4) Some defiance is needed and Aftab Alam provides it, stepping away to blast Ferguson through the covers. Off one ball, Aftab scores twice as many runs as Ikram managed in 22, which rather makes you wonder what Ikram was doing at No.8. That\u2019s a nasty blow in more than one sense. A length ball from Ferguson reared up at Rashid, hitting him on the grille and then ricocheting into the stumps. He stops ten yards into the long walk off, clearly feeling groggy. Hope he\u2019s OK \u2013 it\u2019s been a bad day for it, with the net bowler hit by a shot from David Warner earlier. And that\u2019s drinks, with poor Afghanistan reeling. 33rd over: Afghanistan 130-7 (Hashmatullah 38, Rashid Khan 0) Rashid can bat, which is lucky because Afghanistan could do with another hundred here. Ikram finally locates the middle of his bat, and it\u2019s the end of him. A full ball outside off, a decent connection but a touch late on it, and a simple catch at backward point. He was adhesive while he lasted, helping Hashmatullah add 21 off 52 balls. 32nd over: Afghanistan 130-6 (Hashmatullah 38, Ikram 2) Ikram gets another run! And it\u2019s another edge, but very different \u2013 he aimed into the covers, it went towards mid-on, and he scuttled through for a rather risky single. 31st over: Afghanistan 129-6 (Hashmatullah 38, Ikram 1) Ikram is off the mark! With an edge! That was dropped! By Taylor at slip, tipping it over the bar. 30th over: Afghanistan 127-6 (Hashmatullah 37, Ikram 0) Neesham\u2019s looking for a sixth scalp, and even Hashmatullah can see that the thing to do is just to keep him out. Neesham finishes with 10-1-31-5 after grabbing a wicket in each of his first three overs and a couple more in his seventh \u2013 he even had time for a wobble in the middle. Those are the best figures of his professional career, never mind international. 29th over: Afghanistan 126-6 (Hashmatullah 36, Ikram 0) Nearly another one as Hashmatullah inside-edges Henry past his leg stump. Anybody know the Afghani expression for Harrow cut? 28th over: Afghanistan 121-6 (Hashmatullah 31, Ikram 0) Yet another one-run over, from Neesham. Ikram has now survived nine balls, mostly by swaying out of the line. \u201cG\u2019day Tim.\u201d G\u2019day Geoff Lemon, Guardian contributor and winner of the Wisden Book of the Year award. \u201cAdam [Collins] and I had a really interesting interview with Neesham a few days ago, where he talked about having been a perfectionist to the point that he came to hate cricket. And now having changed that to just enjoying what he does, so he can relax. Could be worth linking to given his five-for.\u201d 27th over: Afghanistan 120-6 (Hashmatullah 30, Ikram 0) That\u2019s better! Matt Henry returns and Hashmatullah slaps him through the covers for a handsome four. Abhijato answers my question [15:51], which presumably means it\u2019s no longer rhetorical. \u201cAs it turns out to be,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m a sixteen year old student living in Kolkata, India. Courtesy BCCI and its control over the schedule (not that I encourage it), all the day World Cup matches start at 3pm in my timezone, so I can follow the OBOs even as I oversleep every morning (source: Mother). Courtesy my school, the summer vacation has been going on for almost a month now, leaving me plenty of free time after I distribute my study and assignment completion hours throughout the day to accommodate this cricket-watching schedule. My school will reopen from next Monday, hence curtailing my future participation in your live coverage. Hope to send in emails time-to-time anyways!\u201d My hunch is you\u2019ll manage it. There\u2019s a whole world in that paragraph. 26th over: Afghanistan 115-6 (Hashmatullah 25, Ikram 0) Hashmatullah can\u2019t resist a waft at Neesham, which connects only with thin air. He\u2019s carrying the hopes of a nation here and he needs to stick around for at least an hour. 25th over: Afghanistan 114-6 (Hashmatullah 24, Ikram 0) Out comes Ikram Alikhil, who is 18 and only just off the plane. As a teenager with jetlag, he\u2019s got to be grateful that this is a day-nighter. He\u2019s sufficiently awake to keep out a yorker from Trent Boult, and then to arch back and evade a lifter. No runs yet, but two feathers in his cap already. 24th over: Afghanistan 109-6 (Hashmatullah 19, Ikram 0) Neesham, so good in his first spell, was only middling in his second until that over, but now he has the formidable figures of 7-1-28-5. And another! A better ball from Neesham, who finds steep lift in the corridor, and that\u2019s a five-for. Just when they were eyeing respectability, Afghanistan slip back into the mire. Nabi tries a dab off Neesham, misjudges the bounce and presents Latham with the simplest of catches. 23rd over: Afghanistan 100-4 (Nabi 9, Hashmatullah 14) After a 27-minute break, the players are back on the field. Trent Boult is bowling, two balls into his second spell: he completes an over that goes for just a single. Apparently it\u2019s still a 50-over match, which may not play to Afghanistan\u2019s strengths any more than this blustery day. Play will resume at 4.05pm, in five minutes, according to our friends at Cricinfo. The same wind that is blowing the rain in and out at Taunton is making its presence felt at Cardiff, where CricViz noted a short time ago that 96 per cent of Jofra Archer\u2019s deliveries had been clocked at 140kph. He\u2019s off now, but Mark Wood is on, which is a fine example of the fire giving way to the frying pan. More on Afghanistan\u2019s game plan. \u201cJames Wrout [15:24] is nine-tenths right,\u201d says Romeo, \u201cbut Afghanistan\u2019s young players are used to much shorter games where it\u2019s six or miss (or out). Hazrat first played with a hard ball only six years ago, and the tape-ball game the youngsters in Afghanistan play is usually ten overs per innings. As Hazrat says, you have to go for a six every ball. It\u2019ll take a while for them to get into the habit of not getting out, but there are players who can do this.\u201d An email for anyone who was watching children\u2019s telly in Britain in about 1971. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying the occasional aerial view of the village of Trumpton,\u201d says Alistair Connor. \u201c\u2018This is the clock... The Taunton clock...\u2019 It\u2019s a bit niche, but frankly Taunton doesn\u2019t ring any other bells for me, and I\u2019ve driven through it at least once. \u2018Pugh, Pugh, Barney McGrew, Cuthbert, Dibble and Grubb\u2019 are presumably the backbone of the local XI?\u201d Ha. \u201cA message of optimism,\u201d declares Abhijato Sensarma. Where are you, Abhi, and do you ever sleep? \u201cAfghanistan are scoring at round 4.50 rpo. They might have lost wickets but they have surprising batting depth, with a majestically wristy Rashid coming in only at number eight! Rather than taking risks, the conditions are helpful enough to let them peacefully knock the ball around. If they manage to get a score in excess of 240+, panic can easily set in for the Kiwis. They\u2019re known to start too slowly and rely too much on Ross Taylor and/or the lower middle order rescuing them, especially during chases. If the spinners can keep their act together while eking out a few wickets too, something special could indeed take place. The thriller is still afoot!\u201d Full marks for positivity, but I\u2019d like to see you tell Martin Guptill he\u2019s a slow starter. Where\u2019s Annie Lennox when you need her? The PA goes for Prince instead. 22nd over: Afghanistan 99-4 (Nabi 9, Hashmatullah 13) Another good over for Afghanistan as Nabi cuts for a measured two and Neesham, straying onto the pads, throws in four leg byes. This partnership is 29 off eight overs, and worth twice that in the circumstances. 21st over: Afghanistan 90-4 (Nabi 7, Hashmatullah 12) We\u2019re back, de Grandhomme is still on, and Hashmatullah is in the mood, hitting a majestic cover drive. Officially, no time has been lost, so it\u2019s still a 50-over match, in theory. James Wrout is back for more. \u201cI think my two favourite teams (Afg and WI) both suffer from the same deficiency,\u201d he sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s either dots or fours. I wish they could turn the strike over more often, like India and England do. I\u2019m no tactical genius, so the coaches are probably ahead of me with this idea. What a shame it hasn\u2019t sunk in yet.\u201d Play will resume at 3.30, in about ten minutes, assuming the weather doesn\u2019t do another about-turn. That\u2019s Afghanistan\u2019s job. \u201cA slow accumulation of strata,\u201d says an email subject line. Edmund King, you know how to leave the reader wanting more. \u201cI can\u2019t help feeling that this game, with its slow accumulations of scoring, its occasional sudden unconformities, and now the steady drift of wind and rain across the landscape, feels very geological. Or perhaps I\u2019m projecting. I\u2019ve spent much of the last week wandering the coastal paths around Berwick and have become obsessed with the Lower Carboniferous, which is a turn of events I did not see coming. Does anyone out there have any recommendations for books that can be read by someone who knows little about British rocks and landforms, but would like to learn?\u201d Edmund is right to assume that that question needs to go over my head. But I do know one thing about geology, after getting into a chat with a geologist at a college reunion. \u201cGeology,\u201d she told me, \u201cis everything over 66 million years old. The rest is gardening.\u201d Guess what? The sun is now shining. The umps are in the middle, showing off their scarlet anoraks. It\u2019s now raining hard \u2013 \u201cstair rods!\u201d according to Mark Nicholas \u2013 so you have permission to follow the action elsewhere, as long as you stay with The Guardian. Djokovic is out! And England\u2019s seamers, of whom there are five today, have started solidly against Bangladesh. 20th over: Afghanistan 84-4 (Nabi 6, Hashmatullah 7) Neesham continues, but maybe that change of ends was a mistake. Nabi lofts him for what feels like four or six all the way, only for the ball to stop in the soggy turf. And now they\u2019re off for rain. Pity, but the wind should send it on its way fairly soon. 19th over: Afghanistan 79-4 (Nabi 3, Hashmatullah 6) Is the nightmare over? We can but hope, as there\u2019s a single or two and even a cut for four, by Hashmatullah off de Grandhomme. What Ferguson has done to be taken off is not quite clear. A few captains in this World Cup seem to be playing by the usual conventions rather than going for the kill \u2013 Jason Holder did it against Australia, taking Oshane Thomas off when he was on fire, and it probably cost them the match. \u201cHow\u2019s the OBO?\u201d wonders my colleague Emma John. \u201cI\u2019m covering the game in Taunton. I think you\u2019d really like the playlist they\u2019ve got on the PA down here at Taunton. It\u2019s pretty indie. At the end of the first over I heard the words \u2018Barbra Streis-end\u2019 over the tannoy and thought maybe the ICC had renamed the ends as well as the grounds. Then I realised they were playing Duck Sauce.\u201d 18th over: Afghanistan 72-4 (Nabi 1, Hashmatullah 1) Now we see why Neesham went off \u2013 he was just changing ends, having clearly decided that he could do better than snapping up three quick wickets. That\u2019s another maiden. Off the last 44 balls, Afghanistan have amassed 6 for 4. 17th over: Afghanistan 72-4 (Nabi 1, Hashmatullah 1) Not much happening in this over, apart from two oddities. A bowler with three for 10 is taken off, as Neesham gives way to de Grandhomme. And a batsman, Hashmatullah, gets off the mark from his 20th ball. 16th over: Afghanistan 71-4 (Nabi 1, Hashmatullah 0) Yet another maiden from Ferguson. This has turned into a Test match, with slips and leg slips. And it\u2019s not a form of the game that the Afghanis are used to. If you\u2019ve ever felt like emailing the OBO, now\u2019s your chance. 15th over: Afghanistan 71-4 (Nabi 1, Hashmatullah 0) Slight pause there while I called Tanya Aldred to warn her that this innings may not go the distance. She was at the cricket in a way \u2013 a fund-raising afternoon for her daughter\u2019s team. Something to do with forgetting the prizes for the raffle: proper creekit. Now come on Afghanistan, dig in for a few overs. If Ultra Edge was a person, it might decide, in the interests of a proper day out for the crowd, that there was no edge. But it\u2019s not, so Gulbadin has to go. And that\u2019s drinks, with a dream start for Afghanistan turning into a nightmare. Gulbadin is given caught behind, slashing at a wide one from Neesham, and he\u2019s looking for a reprieve, possibly out of sheer desperation. 14th over: Afghanistan 70-3 (Gulbadin 4, Hashmatullah 0) Another maiden from Ferguson, who now has the improbable figures of 3-2-9-1. He would have been right at home in the first World Cup, 44 years ago. 13th over: Afghanistan 70-3 (Gulbadin 4, Hashmatullah 0) The captain, Gulbadin, has had enough of this nonsense: he sees a short one so early that his pull goes straight back past Neesham. But before that we had three wickets for no runs in the space of 11 balls. After a terrific powerplay, the wheels have come off. Another one! Oh dear. Rahmat sees something juicy on his legs, only to get a leading edge and present Guptill at gully with the easiest of catches. This game has spun through 180 degrees in about five minutes. 12th over: Afghanistan 66-2 (Rahmat 0, Hashmatullah 0) Ferguson, who earned the wicket with his extra bounce, completes a wicket-maiden with a 91mph bat-beater outside off. Hashmatullah did well not to hit that. Meanwhile, in Cardiff, England have made the highest score of this World Cup, and their own highest in World Cup history. See what Rob Smyth made of it here. Nooooooooor! A bouncer from Ferguson, a tickle or a glove, a catch behind, and the end of the classiest 31 you\u2019ll ever see. 11th over: Afghanistan 66-1 (Noor Ali 31, Rahmat 0) Now they\u2019ve seen off Henry too (5-0-38-0). Jimmy Neesham enters the fray and there\u2019s more sumptuousness from Noor Ali, who off-drives like a star. But then Neesham strikes as Hazrat gets a bit carried away with his own stroke-making. I got ahead of myself there and so did Hazrat, who scoops a square something and picks out Munro at deep point. Shame. 10th over: Afghanistan 61-0 (Hazratullah 34, Noor Ali 26) Another little victory for Afghanistan: they\u2019ve seen off Trent Boult, who was testing as usual (4-0-13-0). Lockie Ferguson comes on, bringing a gift for Hazrat, who leg-glances for four. And then Noor spots a full one and crunches it away with a square drive to round off the powerplay in style. \u201cTeacher\u2019s pest,\u201d is how Brian Withington begins his latest. \u201cAs someone perhaps guilty of sticking his hand up rather too often, might I be permitted a further observation?\u201d Oh, go on then. \u201cIt sounds like a cracking day for competitive kite flying between innings - where you attempt to cut the opposition string and then chase after the downed kite. I believe it\u2019s a very big deal in Afghanistan.\u201d 9th over: Afghanistan 51-0 (Hazratullah 30, Noor Ali 21) Hazrat\u2019s policy of going aerial finally pays off with swivel for six off Henry. And then he tries an orthodox cricket shot, with a rasping cut for four. That\u2019s fifty up, and a big boost for Afghanistan \u2013 their best opening stand for ages. \u201cI have a feeling about this game,\u201d says Romeo. \u201cWith Noor Ali in and Rahmat to come, there will be backbone for the hitters to bat around. I hope I feel the same later on. I\u2019ve been following Afghan cricket for years now and even flew for four hours to see them at Lord\u2019s against MCC. I think there\u2019s a bit of disinformation floating around about Asghar: as I understand it, he has an injury (could be wrong). In any event, AfghanAtalan!\u201d 8th over: Afghanistan 39-0 (Hazratullah 19, Noor Ali 20) The better Noor plays, the worse Hazrat gets. He wafts at Boult and is dropped by Ross Taylor at first slip. It was a tough one, fast and high. Here\u2019s a rather irate email. \u201cThis is NOT a minor match, Tim.\u201d OK... \u201cApart from the futile pleasure of seeing NZ at the top of the points table for as long as possible, it\u2019s all about the glorious stealth march to the semis. They looked a bit genteel against Sri Lanka, they need to learn to put the boot in. England and India seem nailed on for the semis, and in spite of my moral obligation to think the worst of Australia, they are looking good too. \u201cSo. Rendezvous at Old Trafford on the 22nd, for the quarter-final against West Indies \u2013 as it happens my mate Stanley from Trinidad has got us tickets.\u201d 7th over: Afghanistan 37-0 (Hazratullah 18, Noor Ali 19) Noor has now decided to be Greg Chappell. He plays the shot of the day, an on-drive with a flick of the wrist. \u201cThree exquisite shots from Noor Ali,\u201d says a Kiwi voice. \u201cSorry if I missed something,\u201d says a very polite James Wrout, \u201cbut has there been any explanation for Mo Shahzad not playing? Dropped? Injured? Important lunch appointment?\u201d Ha. It\u2019s a knee injury, bad enough to rule him out of the rest of the World Cup. Big moment for his understudy, Ikram Alikhil, who was born this century \u2013 he\u2019s 18, and already has a Test cap in his backpack. 6th over: Afghanistan 33-0 (Hazratullah 18, Noor Ali 15) Boult tries a wide yorker to Noor, who reaches it on the full and straight-drives, again, for four. You may reach for the sky, he\u2019s telling Hazrat, but I\u2019ll keep my feats on the ground. 5th over: Afghanistan 27-0 (Hazratullah 17, Noor Ali 10) A lovely straight drive from Noor, and then the Afghanis throw classicism to the wind. Hazrat sends a skyer to deep midwicket, where two fielders converge without getting a hand on it. Then he hits the ball even higher, and three men pile in, including de Grandhomme, who drops it. 4th over: Afghanistan 19-0 (Hazratullah 14, Noor Ali 5) Another tight over, from Boult, who does appeal for LBW against Hazrat. It\u2019s not given and Boult doesn\u2019t review, wisely, as it was leg-stump-ish and there was an inside edge. Meanwhile there\u2019s been an alarming incident in the nets at the Oval, where an unnamed bowler was hit on the head by a stroke from David Warner. 3rd over: Afghanistan 18-0 (Hazratullah 14, Noor Ali 4) Hazrat slugs Henry to leg and almost picks out the man at deep midwicket, but it would only be a problem if they were playing one-hand-one-bounce. Henry restores order, helped by some sharp fielding by Santner. There\u2019s a roaring wind, better for the Afghan flag-wavers than for the bowlers. 2nd over: Afghanistan 16-0 (Hazratullah 13, Noor Ali 3) At the other end it\u2019s Trent Boult, ranked No.2 in the world. He finds some swing and is half-way to appealing for LBW when Noor Ali jabs down with a leading edge. In the scorebook, it will look perfectly fine, as it goes for two. 1st over: Afghanistan 12-0 (Hazratullah 12, Noor Ali 0) Matt Henry is having a great tournament already, but being a New Zealander, he has gone widely unnoticed. He tries an early bouncer, which Hazratullah hooks nicely. Henry bites back, drawing the edge, but that goes for four too. And then Hazrat swats another four past midwicket. Henry again responds, beating the bat. We have a contest already. Do send in an email if you feel like it, especially (at the risk of sounding like a teacher) if you don\u2019t usually put your hand up. I\u2019d love to know what you think, where you are and what else you\u2019re up to today. \u201cHow,\u201d asks Andrew Harrison, \u201cdo you think Afghanistan will react to the disappointment of their last game? Is there much chance they can pull off an upset here?\u201d Well, most of them have dealt with bigger disappointments, so yes, there is a chance, but it\u2019s slim, and it got a little slimmer when Kane Williamson won the toss. The pitch looks a touch green, but Taunton is usually full of runs and Afghanistan probably need 250 to make a game of it. It was 20 years ago today (plus a fortnight), Sgt Sourav told the band to play. The last time Taunton hosted a men\u2019s ODI was at the 1999 World Cup, when India played Sri Lanka. The day is remembered for one thing \u2013 a stand of 318 by Ganguly and Rahul Dravid. It ought to be known for something else too: being a first taste of ODI cricket for a Somerset boy called Jos Buttler, who went along as a spectator, aged eight, and formed the impression that you are supposed to hit the ball out of the ground \u2013 something he\u2019s just done, for the millionth time, in Cardiff. \u201cWould\u2019ve liked NZ to bat,\u201d says Joachim Suggate, \u201cand see what kind of total they could put up.\u201d Amen to that, but maybe Afghanistan can catch them under the lights, which are brand new and therefore liable to go wrong. Is this an email I see before me? \u201cAnyone for Porter?\u201d asks Brian Withington, spotting my source for the last line of the preamble. \u201cAfternoon Tim. Showing an early glimpse of stocking? God that man knew how to write a lyric ...\u201d He did. But let\u2019s face it, if he was starting out today, he\u2019d be writing for the OBO. One team is unchanged, and you can probably guess which. Afghanistan 1 Hazratullah, 2 Noor Ali, 3 Rahmat Shah, 4 Hashmatullah, 5 Nabi, 6 Gulbadin (capt), 7 Najibullah, 8 Ikram Alikhil (wkt), 9 Rashid Khan, 10 Aftab Alam, 11 Hamid Hassan. NZ 1 Guptill, 2 Munro, 3 Williamson (capt), 4 Taylor, 5 Latham (wkt), 6 Neesham, 7 de Grandhomme, 8 Santner, 9 Henry, 10 Ferguson, 11 Boult. Great for the leaders, not so good for the game. Afternoon everyone. (Anyone?) This is the game for you if you support New Zealand, have a soft spot for Afghanistan, can\u2019t abide England or like a bit of novelty. These two teams have only ever met once in one-day internationals, in the last World Cup, when Daniel Vettori made sure it wasn\u2019t much of a contest. But that was in Napier, where I suspect there weren\u2019t many Afghanistan supporters. Today, in Taunton, at the weekend, the cheers should be more evenly distributed. The New Zealanders are top of the table with two wins out of two and a commanding net run rate, but they\u2019ve had a relatively gentle start (Sri Lanka and Bangladesh). Afghanistan have lost to Australia and, more painfully, to Sri Lanka, but they\u2019re spirited and skilful and will surely rattle one of the big teams in this World Cup. Today would be a great time to do it, as it would prove, with four weeks of the round robin still to come, that these days, heaven knows, anything goes. Play starts at 1.30pm BST and the forecast is for sunny spells."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
