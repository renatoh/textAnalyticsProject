It could be argued that the best way to ensure that a new-born child blossoms into a sporting prodigy is not to make them repeat basic drills from the moment they can walk, nor to spend their infancy forcing them to endure DVDs of the 1970 World Cup, nor even to hand them over to Mr Miyagi and book your seat at the next all-comers karate convention. No, the best way to make your baby brilliant is to give them a silly name. Tiger Woods is the greatest golfer of his generation despite being named after a jungle-roaming feline. Kobe Bryant is the finest basketball player of his time, even though his parents named him after a type of beef produced by herds of hand-massaged Japanese cattle reared on a diet of beer. Serena Williams has won \u00a39m in prize-money alone and shares her name with practically nobody except a short-lived character in Neighbours and a water park in the Finnish town of Espoo. Roger Federer is at the very pinnacle of the men's game, and he is called Roger. In all these cases a ludicrous label appears not to have caused any lasting damage to its wearer. But perhaps we are only now discovering the true cost of taking this rutted route to excellence. The thought occurred this week when Bryant delivered two contradictory interviews about his future at the LA Lakers in an astonishingly short time. First he told a New York radio station he wanted to leave: \"Tough as it is to come to that conclusion, there's no other alternative, you know? It's rough, man, but I don't see how you can rebuild that trust. At this point I'll go play on Pluto.\" Within hours he was back on air. \"I don't want to go anywhere, this is my team,\" he said. \"I love it here.\" Central to the about-turn, apparently, was Bryant's relationship with his coach Phil Jackson. \"Phil is a guy I lean on a lot,\" Bryant said. Given that the 28-year-old shooting guard is 6ft 6in and weighs the best part of 16 stone, this sounds like the most uncomfortable position achieved by anyone called Jackson since Michael's first attempts at his crotch-grab. He might have damaged his credibility but Bryant has become a beacon of hope. He has showed us how to stay clear of the rocks of disappointment and sail calmly into the waters of wisdom. Hell, given the lad's height he might as well just balance a lamp on his head and call himself a lighthouse. If we learn our lesson, summer might never be the same. With the end of the football season - an event which I am assured will one day happen - comes a period in which the transfer market is marked by rumour, counter-rumour, reverse-rumour and, more than anything, a near-total absence of action. Recent summers seem to have been dominated by a story which has been manipulated to extract as much content as possible from a single vague idea from someone's vivid, bizarrely popular but wildly repetitive imagination, and it looks like this year will be exactly the same. That's right, there's another Harry Potter book coming - and also a nightmarish amount of misplaced transfer gossip. Few survivors of the summer of 2003 have shaken off the grisly memory of the will-Ronaldinho-go-to-Manchester-United-or-will-it-be-Barcelona saga; two years later the was-the-European-Cup-enough-to-convince-Steven-Gerrard-to-forsake-Chelsea-to-stay-at-Liverpool affair brought the country to its knees. What Bryant has shown us is that these stories can condense their limited drama into a small timeframe. In the time it takes broadcasters to realise that a footballer wants to leave his club he can speak to his advisers, have clear-the-air talks with management and release a retraction, entertaining fans with the speed at which he can change his mind and, more importantly, allowing them to actually enjoy their holidays. My only worry is that if we ask footballers to modify their lifestyles to make themselves more like Kobe, they'll simply decide to live on a diet of beer and constant massage. And that's hardly a modification at all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
