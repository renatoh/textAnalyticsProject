Wasps, Bath and Leicester between them won 22 of the 26 domestic league titles between 1988 and 2013. Now, like the other former champions Harlequins, Sale Sharks and Newcastle, they cannot even make the top four. It underlines the unshakable grip Saracens and Exeter Chiefs have taken on the league, as well as the recent improvements made under enlightened new regimes that have hauled Gloucester and Northampton into the play-offs for the first time since 2011 and 2015 respectively. Barring a Cherry and White upset or a Saints miracle, a third Saracens v Exeter final in four years is looming. That likelihood is not simply based on Gloucester and Northampton having to return to grounds where, in the regular season, they collectively conceded 78 points and scored 36. Saracens are currently Europe\u2019s most dominant team and are chasing a trophy treble, if the reserve team Premiership Shield is included. Exeter have just topped the league for a second successive year; no Premiership club this century has scored more tries in a season. It has all made for a curiously two-paced campaign: exciting in terms of its dog-eat-dog nature but short on consistent quality to the extent that only five points separated the six teams between fourth and ninth. Northampton\u2019s final haul of 56 points is the lowest of any previous play-off side, while Quins finished fifth despite losing 12 of their 22 matches and seventh-placed Sale could qualify for Europe (if La Rochelle finish in the top six of the Top 14) with the league\u2019s second-lowest scoring tally. This is also the first time Leicester have finished outside the top six; the Tigers\u2019 points difference of minus 154 was the worst in the league. Saints may also care to recall the uncomfortable example of Newcastle who finished fourth last season, lost at Exeter in the semis and finished rock bottom 12 months later. Chris Boyd\u2019s team had some bright attacking moments at Sandy Park on Saturday before going down 40-21 but have little time to devise a fresh strategy for defusing the Chiefs\u2019 power-packed possession game. \u201cThere\u2019s not too many surprises,\u201d said Boyd. \u201cYou know what\u2019s coming, we\u2019ve just got to find a way to deal with it. The critical thing for us is whether we\u2019re going to be able to stop the way they play. When they\u2019ve got the ball we find it hard to control their game.\u201d His hardest-hitting forward, Courtney Lawes, insists all is not lost. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we got completely wiped out and we don\u2019t know where we went wrong. We played that first half pretty well but our [poor] discipline kept them in the game. People can say what they want. We are fine with being underdogs \u2013 we beat them at our patch earlier in the season and, if we execute our gameplan, we can beat anyone.\u201d The other sizeable \u201cif\u201d surrounds the England captain, Dylan Hartley, yet to be sighted on a competitive rugby field in 2019. If he is not fit to play in a semi-final almost five months after being stood down with a \u201cgrumbling\u201d knee, it will beg numerous fresh questions, none of them comfortable with the World Cup in Japan approaching. Boyd, for one, does not appear entirely convinced about Hartley\u2019s state of readiness. \u201cDylan trained fully on Monday and Tuesday and trained really well but, when he came back in on Thursday, he was feeling the effects,\u201d said Boyd. \u201cHe probably could have played but I doubt he\u2019d have got through 75 minutes [following Reece Marshall\u2019s early injury] at the physical level that game reached. When you have lower-limb injuries you\u2019ve got to try and get some match fitness as well. Clearly he hasn\u2019t had a lot of that lately. It\u2019ll be a really big ask for him to come back at that level straight away.\u201d Exeter look certain to be without their Welsh international winger Alex Cuthbert, who has an injured knee, but motivation will not be an issue. As Rob Baxter, their director of rugby, was quick to stress, his players are desperate to atone for their defeat by Saracens in last season\u2019s finale. \u201cThe team were genuinely hurt after the final last year,\u201d Baxter said. \u201cI looked around the changing room and it was just silent \u2013 upset and a little angry. I\u2019d like to think the players who felt they let themselves down a little bit last year will be some of the guys who stand up and start driving us over the next two weeks.\u201d Saracens, for their part, will have to overcome the absence of the influential Mako Vunipola against a Gloucester side who have not played in a Premiership final since 2007. Boyd does not dispute that the league\u2019s top two sides have been \u201ca distance ahead\u201d of their rivals but is not convinced Saracens will have things all their own way. \u201cI actually like the way Gloucester play the game and I think that\u2019ll be an interesting contrast of styles.\u201d Maybe, but the bookmakers quoting Gloucester at 12-1 and Northampton at 25-1 for the title clearly anticipate another Saracens-Exeter showdown."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
