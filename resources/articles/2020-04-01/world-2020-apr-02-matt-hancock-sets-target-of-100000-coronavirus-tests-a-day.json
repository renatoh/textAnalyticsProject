After several days of intense scrutiny over failures in testing, including the prioritisation of the public over doctors and nurses, Hancock said he was setting out a new \u201cfive-pillar\u201d strategy. He said England would hit 100,000 tests a day, which would include antigen tests that show whether people are currently suffering from Covid-19, as well as antibody tests to see whether people have had the infection and recovered. Speaking at the end of his seven days of quarantine after testing positive for the virus, he said: \u201cI\u2019m now setting the goal of 100,000 tests per day by the end of this month. That is the goal and I\u2019m determined we\u2019ll get there.\u201d On Tuesday, there was capacity for 12,799 daily tests in England, although just over 10,650 people were tested. The government\u2019s target by mid-April had been to test 25,000 a day. Hancock said it was his decision to prioritise testing of patients over NHS staff, and added that he thought any health secretary would have done the same. \u201cI understand why NHS staff want tests, so they can get back to the frontline, of course I do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I took the decision that the first priority has to be the patients for whom the results of a test could be the difference in treatment that is the difference between life and death. \u201cI believe anybody in my shoes would have taken the same decision.\u201d His announcement came at the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing, where he announced that more than \u00a313bn of historical debt owed by hospital trusts would be written off to place the National Health Service in a \u201cstronger position\u201d to respond to the crisis. The health secretary said he had also made \u00a3300m available for community pharmacies and that he wanted to make sure \u201cevery part\u201d of the health and care system was supported. \u201cToday, to help NHS trusts to deliver what\u2019s needed without worrying about past finances, I can announce that I\u2019m writing off \u00a313.4bn of historic NHS debt,\u201d he said. \u201cThis landmark step will not only put the NHS in a stronger position to be able to respond to this global coronavirus pandemic, but it will ensure that our NHS has stronger foundations for the future too.\u201d In an unusually detailed press conference following several days of criticism of the government\u2019s strategy, Hancock also attempted to confront claims that the UK is lagging behind the responses to the disease in other European countries such as Germany. Hancock said he was going to \u201clevel with you\u201d on the challenges the UK faced and the government\u2019s plan to increase testing significantly. The UK had not gone into this crisis with a huge diagnostics industry, as Germany had, he said, and so had been \u201ccatching up\u201d. Demand for materials had led to a shortage of both swabs and reagents, Hancock said. The swabs issue has been fixed but \u201cwe are still tackling the reagents issue, which is a global challenge\u201d, he said. In what appeared to be a first acknowledgement from the government that mistakes had been made, he added: \u201cThere will be criticisms made, and some of them will be justified.\u201d Hancock said there was a \u201cchallenge\u201d in ensuring the public could have confidence in the tests being used on NHS staff. He added that a number of testing methods being analysed had failed to positively diagnose a coronavirus patient. \u201cIn one case a test that I\u2019m being urged to buy missed three out of four positive cases for coronavirus. \u201cThat means that three-quarters of cases, that test would have given the false comfort of sending someone with coronavirus back on the wards. Approving tests that don\u2019t work is dangerous and I will not do it,\u201d he said. Hancock paid an emotional tribute to NHS staff who had lost their lives, and expressed his \u201cdeepest condolences\u201d to the friends and families of all coronavirus victims. \u201cIf the past few weeks have shown us anything, it\u2019s that we are steadfast as a country in our resolve to defeat this invisible killer,\u201d he said. He went on to acknowledge that most of the NHS staff who had died had been migrants to the UK. \u201cI am profoundly moved by the compassion and the commitment that we are seeing from people right across the country, and in the health and care system we have lost colleagues too. \u201cMany of those who have died who are from the NHS were people who came to this country to make a difference, and they did, and they\u2019ve given their lives in sacrifice, and we salute them,\u201d he said. Hancock said he had come back from self-isolation on Thursday \u201credoubled in my determination to fight this virus with everything I\u2019ve got\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
