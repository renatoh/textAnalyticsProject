Surrey, the outstanding team in the land, play Gloucestershire, the one-day specialists who have won the last four knockout trophies, not to mention last year's National League title. Even the pitch looks a cracker, though the weather could spoil the party; the forecast suggests the match may not be concluded until tomorrow. This final, though, has not fallen at the right time for either side. Gloucestershire's invincibility was dented by Durham in the Cheltenham and Gloucester Trophy last week. This was their first defeat in knockout competition since July 1998. Their best one-day side, so settled in recent seasons, has also been undermined by long-term injury. They can hardly moan to Surrey, though. Surrey have been so disrupted by both injuries and Test calls this year that their chances of making it a hat-trick of championships is receding fast. All will depend, surely, on their two matches against Yorkshire. Though they won the Benson and Hedges Cup in 1997, and the National League second division last year, Surrey are more consistent over the longer course. Their success in one-day cricket owes more to individual brilliance than the mobilisation of an entire team, something Gloucestershire have been exceptionally good at in recent years. Surrey's performance in the C&amp;G against Yorkshire on Wednesday and Thursday was a dire disappointment. On balance, Gloucestershire are the side more likely to play to their potential. Neither will be at full strength. Surrey, likely to be without Graham Thorpe (calf), will make a late check on Alex Tudor's thigh before they finalise their line-up. Ian Salisbury is also out but the seamer Tim Murtagh, who played in the midweek C&amp;G defeat at Headingley, could play again. Thorpe jogged round the boundary, took part in a fitness game and later had a net. After that Keith Medlycott, the Surrey coach, refused to rule him out of today's game. But he had an optimistic twinkle in his eye. Gloucestershire will again be without their opening bowlers Mike Smith and Jon Lewis though the latter, who had a stress fracture in his back, was not far away from selection. \"We might have chanced Jon if it had been a green seamer,\" said their coach John Bracewell. \"But it looks a good wicket and he hasn't had much cricket lately so we decided against.\" Gloucestershire may field the same team as that beaten by Durham in the C&amp;G but the batsman Rob Cunliffe, who played in last year's Benson and Hedges Cup final, has been added to the squad and could play at the expense of Dominic Hewson. A tricky one for the bookies, this match. But Coral have installed Surrey as 4-6 favourites with Gloucestershire not far behind at 11-10. William Hill also have Surrey favourites at 8-13 with Gloucestershire 6-5. Meanwhile Gloucestershire's veteran wicketkeeper, Jack Russell, describes England's decision not to have a wicket-keeping coach as \"unprofessional\". Russell, who played the last of his 54 Tests in 1997, said yesterday: \"Over the past 10 years the importance of the wicketkeeper at international level has changed and is not a priority any more. \"Would you expect the England football team not to have a goalkeeping coach? Leave it out. How professional is that? It's a multi-million pound business. Don't tell me there is not enough money. \"When Chris Read came into the squad he was left to sink. I had Alan Knott to turn to all my career and even now I speak to him even though he has emigrated.\" Gloucestershire: D R Hewson, K J Barnett, M G N Windows, I J Harvey, C G Taylor, J N Snape, R C Russell, *M W Alleyne, M C J Ball, M J Cawdron, J M M Averis, J Lewis, M A Hardinges, R J Cunliffe.
