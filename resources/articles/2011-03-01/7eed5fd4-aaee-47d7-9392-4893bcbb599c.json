But the 100% cut in funding to the Northern Ireland Music Therapy Service (The true cost of the cuts, 25 March) is not just a callous disregard for 600 vulnerable children and young people, but a crass example of short-term, unjoined-up thinking. Early intervention with therapies of this kind has been shown to help to establish more independent lifestyles for this client group and enhanced quality of life. Perhaps the government is happy to leave the most intellectually disadvantaged and vulnerable young to their fate and pay to deal with the consequences when they grow up to become frustrated and volatile adults, many of whom will end up in prison or other institutions.

Well, I was marching, wearing my clerical collar, but the placard I was carrying was in support of the Manchester council's free advice centre, which has been closed, despite many decades of giving benefit advice, enabling people to keep roofs over their heads and point them to benefits enabling them to live on low wages, and create fuller lives for themselves and their families. I considered that modest placard was far more educational than a gaudy, self-aggrandising, tub-thumping piece of silken schmutter. The church is not the bishops, priests, nor paraphernalia, but the tens of thousands of people who pray weekly for the world and all humanity, and also give the greatest numbers of hours in voluntary work. There were many church-going Christians on that march and also many mosque-going, temple-going, gurdwara-going people of other faiths who were supporting their brothers and sisters. Believe it or not, people who have a faith are also union members. Does your correspondent think Jesus would have been clad in purple marching under a banner, or in an anorak marching alongside those hit by the cuts? And let's not go into Jesus overturning the tables of the moneylenders or I might be accused of being political. Rev Jo Williams Chesham, Buckinghamshire \u2022 Martin Rowson's cartoon is brilliant (28 March). I was at the march on Saturday and saw no disorder. Among the many \"official\" banners and placards with sweeping slogans, I saw one which encapsulated the specific effects satirised in the cartoon. It read \"No cuts to transport for lunch club for very elderly in Islington\". It is the poorest and most vulnerable who will pay for the excesses of the financial sector.
