He is leading one of the most fought over and significant developments in European research for decades, and the excitement and responsibility of it all has been keeping him awake at night. Kafatos is president of the \u20ac7.5bn (\u00a35bn) European Research Council, which will be launched officially next week. The ERC will create the first genuine European competition for blue-skies research in all fields, from social sciences to engineering. Through the ERC, research teams from across Europe will compete with each other, for the first time, for funding awarded solely on scientific merit. \"I wake up in the middle of the night more frequently than I used to,\" says Kafatos. \"My colleagues and I very much feel the responsibility of this. We are not playing political games of influence. But I am also very excited. It's one of those magical moments when the time has come for a big idea that has captured people's imagination.\" European research has long been playing below par. The wars of the past century have taken their toll; many of Europe's finest brains were lost, and it has been struggling to catch up ever since. Today, Europe has some first-class universities and scientific institutions, but it has yet to reach its full potential. Between 1980 and 2003, Europe had 68 Nobel laureates in medicine, physics and chemistry. The US had 154. With competition from China and India, Europe's share could fall still further. Little competition Scientists have long argued that one reason for Europe's relatively weak research performance is the lack of genuine competition between researchers; at present, researchers are restricted to vying with their fellow countrymen for blue-skies funding. Another reason is Europe's poor ability to attract young people into a research career. Recent estimates suggest Europe needs an extra 700,000 researchers if it is to meet its target of raising spending on research and development by 3% of GDP by 2010. The ERC aims to help heal these ills by creating pan-European competition, and it will have a funding stream dedicated to young researchers, says Kafatos. \"The ERC will help give Europeans the same opportunity to be creative and succeed in the pursuit of research and scholarship as their colleagues across the Atlantic. Asia is also investing heavily in science, and things are getting interesting in Canada and Australia, too. Europe has to catch up. \"In Europe, we are not good to our young scientists. We make them jump through hoops when they should be running. There is a hierarchical scientific system, with a very few powerful people at the top, that does not engage the creativity and enthusiasm of the young - so they vote with their feet.\" There could be no one better suited to inspiring young people into science than Kafatos, who is also professor of immunogenomics at Imperial College London, where he studies the malaria-carrying mosquito. His passion and childlike wonder at the marvels science offers is infectious. Future of research \"Being a scientist is a hard job,\" he says. \"You have to be there with all your dedication and enthusiasm. It's not just about making a living - there are better ways of making money - it's a way to be creative. \"It is a crime how many science departments in UK universities are closing. Modern society depends on the discoveries that come from research. Fundamental research is not just star-gazing, it's understanding how the world works. What will be the medical advances of the next 20 to 30 years? How will we address the scourges of humanity, such as HIV, malaria and TB? How will we deal with them, not just as sorry statistics, but as something we can do something about? All of this starts with basic research.\" Kafatos has a glittering array of medals and prizes for academic excellence, and membership of the world's most prestigious societies, including the National Academy of Sciences in the US and foreign membership of the UK's Royal Society. He says he owes his fascination for biology to a \"marvellous\" schoolteacher in his hometown in Crete, and an \"inspiring\" professor who was his mentor during his undergraduate days at Cornell University in the US. But his will to succeed, confidence and finely honed diplomatic skills, which Kafatos says have been essential in nurturing the ERC to life, he inherited from his family. \"I discovered biology in my teens,\" Kafatos recalls. \"When I realised how our bodies and hormones work and how our minds operate, I wanted to contribute to such fascinating discoveries. \"My father had been an immigrant in the US and had dreamt of starting an agricultural college in Crete, but his plans failed amidst the devastation of the second world war. He was determined that his three sons would have different opportunities, so he taught us to speak English. We could speak only English around the dinner table, much to my mother's annoyance, as she did not understand it.\" Student experience Kafatos won a scholarship to study zoology at Cornell in 1959 and graduated a year early, in 1961. The experience was the making of him. \"In my first few months there, I learned that there was a very bright new professor of biology, Thomas Eisner, who is one of the fathers of chemical ecology. So I knocked on his door and told him that I was a first-year student and wanted to do research with him. He went over to his bookshelf and took down 10 books and told me to go away and read them before I came back to talk to him. The next week I went back having read all the books and the rest is history. From then on, I was taking advanced courses and working in the lab alongside the post-doctorate students. I was their mascot!\" Kafatos went on to Harvard where, at the age of 29, he became the university's youngest professor. But he wanted to go back to his roots, and began dividing his time between Massachusetts and Greece, where he founded Crete's Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology. \"I wanted to give something back. I am a strong believer in mentoring and institution building, and wanted to give other people the chances I almost did not have.\" But it was the passionate community spirit of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Germany that attracted Kafatos away from the confines of Harvard to become its director general in 1993. \"The atmosphere was buzzing with the enthusiasm of young people for their science. It was paradise. More so than at Harvard, where they were more concerned with prestige.\" It was the same buzz that drew Kafatos to Imperial College in 2005, where we sit talking amid the faculty of natural sciences' beehive of activity. Kafatos's intention at Imperial was to concentrate exclusively on his research. But when the opportunity to head up the ERC came along, he couldn't turn it down. Kafatos has been instrumental in turning the ERC from a wacky idea dreamt up by a few idealistic scientists, five years ago, into a concrete reality with strong political backing and the whole of the scientific community behind it. But there have been many growing pains on the way. \"To have vision, to be able to listen with respect but speak strongly without being offensive are key to success in this position,\" he says. He says his upbringing gave him the skills he needed to get the ERC off the ground. \"Growing up in a large extended family under the stress of the Nazi occupation made me very aware of my community values. It was frowned upon in my family to be self-centred and they encouraged me to be solicitous of other people's views. As the middle one of three brothers - not the most privileged position - I learned to listen and be sensitive to other people and to push for common goals insistently, without alienating people.\" The ERC is not secure yet. It now has to prove itself with the eyes of the world watching. With such high expectations for such a young organisation, the ERC could be setting itself up to fail. But Kafatos is bullish. \"I am absolutely certain the ERC will succeed,\" he says. \"We will make mistakes along the way, but we will correct them. We are running a marathon and the path ahead is clear.\" Curriculum vitae Age: 67 Job: Chairman of the scientific council of the European Research Council, and professor of immunogenomics at Imperial College London Before that: Director general of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Germany Likes: Music, art, theatre, London Dislikes: Bureaucracy, insensitive people Married to an artist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
