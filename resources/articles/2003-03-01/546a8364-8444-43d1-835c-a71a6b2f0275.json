However, it remains unclear whether Mr Diller is still considering a bid for the assets. US reports earlier his month suggested he was backing away from the idea of a bid for the company and that he was considering resigning in May. Diller's resignation will concern former Channel 4 chief executive, Michael Jackson, whose future with the company must now be in the balance. Mr Jackson was hired by Mr Diller to run USA Networks and went to become head of TV and some film operations when it merged with the French combine just a month after he arrived in Hollywood. Vivendi sources suggest that the business will be sold before the end of the year, but Mr Diller's abrupt - though not entirely unexpected - departure suggests it could be even sooner. Mr Diller, who ran Paramount Pictures in the 1970s and created Rupert Murdoch's Fox Network in the 1980s, is renowned throughout Hollywood circles. He joined Vivendi when the company's former chief executive, Jean-Marie Messier, bought his USA Networks cable group early last year for $10.3bn as part of an extensive acquisition spree that ultimately cost Mr Messier his job. Although Mr Diller only owns a 5% stake in VUE, under the terms of the deal he thrashed out with Vivendi, he has managed to exert an unusual degree of control over the future of the company by dint of a complicated tax arranagement. Under the purchase agreement, the French owner cannot sell any of the assets Mr Diller brought to the table for 15 years, unless it pays a hefty \u00a31.3bn tax charge that would be triggered by the transaction. Vivendi chief executive Jean-Rene Fourtou met Mr Diller in New York last month to try to agree how much he must pay Mr Diller's USA Interactive to cover tax liabilities in the event that some or all of VUE is sold. Among the companies interested in some or all of the group's assets are John Malone's Liberty Media, Hollywood studio MGM and media giant Viacom, which owns the Paramount movie business as well as CBS, MTV and Nickelodeon. The oil tycoon Marvin Davis, who once owned Twentieth Century Fox, emerged as an early bidder and made an offer of $15bn (\u00a39.3bn), plus $5bn in debts, for all of the US assets including the music business. But Mr Davis, who analysts view as an unlikely contender, has become frustrated at Vivendi's perceived refusal to give his bid credibility. Mr Diller's position as chief executive of USA Interactive, the web company that owns several of the most popular sites in the US including Expedia and Hotels.com, will be unaffected. Last year Mr Fortou promised to halve Vivendi's \u00a312bn debt within two years. The huge burden built up during Mr Messier's massive acquisition spree, which transformed the French utility company into a global media giant. The company has already cut its debts to around \u00a39.1bn through the sales of publisher Houghton Mifflin, Italian pay TV company Telepiu and satellite broadcaster Canal Plus Technologies, but analysts are concerned it is running out of options to cut its debt further."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
