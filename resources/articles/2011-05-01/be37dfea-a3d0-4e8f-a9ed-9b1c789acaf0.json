Four and a half years ago he was playing for Chester City in a second-round tie that ended in defeat against Bury only for their opponents to be ejected from the competition for fielding an ineligible player, providing Walters with \"the bit of luck\" he needed to showcase his talent. Chester went on to face Ipswich Town in the third round and Walters, who had joined the club on a free transfer from Wrexham at the start of that season, seized his chance to impress. \"It turned out Bury had played this lad on loan from Hartlepool, Stephen Turnbull, and he wasn't eligible,\" Walters says. \"They had drawn Ipswich but we took over the tie. It was a great draw for us. It was 0-0 at the Deva Stadium, then we lost 1-0 to a late goal in the replay. David Sheepshanks, the Ipswich chairman, sorted out a deal for me with Chester afterwards.\" Although Walters has never looked back since his \u00a3100,000 move to Ipswich, there are of plenty of reminders of how different things could be. \"A lot of the lads I played with at Wrexham and Chester are playing in non-League now. One of my best mates, Paul Linwood, was with me at Chester but he's now with Fleetwood. Gregg Blundell, who partnered me up front against Ipswich, he's at Barrow now. I think I've had a bit of luck along the way. It can happen if your timing's right and you work hard.\" Walters spent three years at Ipswich, which must have felt like a lifetime for someone who has played for 10 clubs since he joined Blackburn Rovers as a trainee in 2000. He enjoyed his time at Portman Road, where he blossomed into one of the best players in the Championship, but he had a bitter fall-out with Roy Keane in the weeks leading up to his \u00a32.75m transfer to Stoke in August and has not spoken to the former Ipswich manager since. Having expressed a desire to leave to play in the Premier League, Walters was stripped of the captaincy as his relationship with Keane quickly deteriorated. Things became so bad that when Walters pulled out of facing Exeter City in a Carling Cup tie in August, after complaining that he was feeling unwell, he felt it necessary to send a picture of his vomit. \"Because of all the hype about me possibly leaving there were a lot of rumours going round and I thought [Keane] may think I wasn't telling the truth because I didn't want to get cup-tied,\" Walters said. \"I sent the physio a photo [of the vomit]. He came round at eight o'clock in the morning with the doctor. I said: 'I'm not fibbing, you can smell my breath.'\" Walters remains aggrieved that he was \"made out to be a bad egg\" and points out that, at the age of 26, he felt he could not turn down the chance to play in the Premier League. He has made the step up with the minimum of fuss and will partner Kenwyne Jones up front against Manchester City today full of confidence after scoring eight times since the turn of the year, including goals against Chelsea and Arsenal. He celebrated the two goals he scored in the semi-final against Bolton in front of his six-year old daughter, Scarlet, who is looking forward to making herself heard at Wembley again. \"She came to the semi-final and was made up,\" said Walters. \"I knew where [the family] were sitting, so I ran right over to her. She's proud and she's got the Wembley flag and waves it near enough every day. She's also been singing the songs these past few weeks \u2013 not the bad ones, the good ones!\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
