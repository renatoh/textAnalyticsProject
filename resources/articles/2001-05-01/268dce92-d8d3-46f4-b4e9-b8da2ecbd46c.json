The rock is red raw and barren. In places, the strata are folded madly like telephone directories buckled by the sun. Isolated, whitewashed villages lie in bays with cliffs at their back climbing 1,000ft in a vertical sweep. Some are accessible only by sea and one is inhabited only in the cooler winter months. In summer, it is like an oven. Sky-blue speedboats fly past with cargoes of women passengers, their Moslem black robes billowing in the breeze. Few people know about Oman's Musandam Peninsular and that is just the way the country's military and its NATO allies have always liked to keep it. This breathtaking region jutting into the Straits of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf was of key strategic importance during the Gulf War. Before the conflict, this was the least-known region of an already secretive country. Iran lies just an hour in a fast speedboat across the Straits, a geographical proximity that has put Oman on its guard in the past. Things are changing. Aware its oil will run out soon, Oman is beginning to open up to tourists and Musandam is its jewel. The best way to see it is by dhow, gliding up the Indian Ocean coast from Dibba and winding in and out of the fjords. Within hours of leaving port, our boat was escorted first by turtles, then grey reef sharks and a sting-ray the size of a small helicopter landing pad. A school of barracuda joined us for a 100 yards or so, fading off seawards when they got weary. Our prow brushed aside a shoal of jackfish and, a few hundred yards out to sea, tuna leapt from the waves. During the warm afternoons, the dhow nosed into the shade of giant cliffs, where shallower waters offered fantastic snorkelling. Almost before the skipper, Anif, had dropped anchor, we donned flippers and masks and leapt into the blue. In a fjord one evening, a pod of Spinner (long-snouted) dolphins raced us as we headed into a dazzling sunset. By night our dhow lolled at the heads of fjords, shielded by high dark walls of rock that reflected the heat they had gathered during the day like giant pocket charcoal blocks. We ate humous, barbecued king fish and dates, yoghurt and honey, while Anif, pilot Yusuf and their friends, who joined us via land each evening with supplies of food and tea, brewed up impromptu jam sessions with guitars and drums. Snuggling under my blanket on deck one night I heard an errant turtle coming up for a gasp of air close to my head, and watched the skies as Orion and his faithful dog Sirius slid behind the mountain to sleep. \u0095 Matthew Brace was a guest of Emirates (020-7808 0033), which flies direct to Dubai from London, Manchester and Birmingham, with return fares costing \u00a3500-\u00a3600; Explore Worldwide (01252 319448) offers a one-week dhow trip (October to April), from \u00a3600."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
