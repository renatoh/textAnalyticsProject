If you wanted a firm foundation upon which to build a film, you really couldn't do much better than that. Director Jack Clayton - who also made Room At The Top, The Great Gatsby and Something Wicked This Way Comes - delivers an ambiguous ghost story and one of the undisputed highpoints of the genre. While it may not be completely true to the book, it's still a remarkably subtle chiller. No weak links in the cast either, Deborah Kerr's repressed governess and the two mightily creepy children under her charge are excellent. It gets under the skin in ways more bombastic movies never will - the apparitions appear in the distance or as reflections, never quite revealing themselves. Freddie Francis' detailed photography eschews the usual ghost story tricks - most of the eeriest scenes occur in broad daylight. The DVD includes Clayton's earlier, Oscar-winning short, The Bespoke Overcoat. You also get a booklet and a typically informative commentary from Professor Christopher Frayling. Also out The Pervert's Guide To Cinema \u00a321.99, ICA Projects No smut here, just exuberant, intellectual musings on cinema from philosopher Slavoj Zizek. Monster House Rental/\u00a317.99, Sony Superior children's animated adventure involving a carnivorous dwelling, and no talking animals. High School Musical \u00a314.99, Buena Vista The all-conquering song-and-dance sensation - sure to be filling Christmas stockings across the land. Michael Haneke Trilogy \u00a337.50, Tartan The Hidden director's first three films -The 7th Continent, Benny's Video and 71 Fragments Of A Chronology Of Chance - on DVD for the first time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
