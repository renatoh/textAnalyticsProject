The Everton manager has confirmed Pickford will return to the starting line-up against Manchester United on Saturday after being dropped for the first time in his Goodison Park career for last weekend\u2019s defeat at Newcastle. Pickford was replaced at St James\u2019 Park by Robin Olsen, the deadline day loan signing from Roma, following an erratic run of form that raised questions over his composure and preceded the controversy surrounding his challenge on Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk. Ancelotti, however, insists he has no desire or intention of changing the England international\u2019s mentality, although he believes the 26-year-old\u2019s performances will improve by playing more on instinct. The Everton manager explained: \u201cHis mentality is good. I don\u2019t want it to change. He\u2019s a good guy, a funny guy, and I don\u2019t want to change his mentality or his character. I think sometimes he did a mistake because he thought too much. He has to use his instinct more because that is really good. He did fantastic saves because when he reacts he is really top top. When he has to act, sometimes he does mistakes in that situation but he is still a young goalkeeper with a lot of quality and there he can improve. \u201cThis is his character and it is difficult to change the character of people. On the pitch he has to be focused on what he is doing, knowing his limit and also knowing where is his quality.\u201d Pickford said it was the first time in seven years that he had been benched when Ancelotti informed the goalkeeper of his decision last week. \u201cI was surprised it was seven years because he is still young,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI talked to him every day this week \u2013 we laugh, we were together \u2013 and I have no message for him. He knows what to do tomorrow. He starts.\u201d Everton will again be without Richarlison against United as the Brazil international completes a three-match suspension but James Rodr\u00edguez, who missed the defeat at Newcastle through injury, is available."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
