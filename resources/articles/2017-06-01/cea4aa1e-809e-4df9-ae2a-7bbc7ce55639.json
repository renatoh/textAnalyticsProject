According to Rory Best, Ireland\u2019s captain, the manner of the Lions\u2019 narrow defeat to the Highlanders was \u201cnot acceptable\u201d and losing in a similar fashion to New Zealand is unthinkable. As far as Best is concerned, the main lesson of the Highlanders game was to finish off opponents when the chance arises. \u201cIt\u2019s about being ruthless,\u201d Best said. \u201cIf we get to Saturday or the following Tuesday or Saturday week more importantly and we go 22-13 up and we don\u2019t put our foot on the throat, that is what NZ teams are good at. \u201c We put ourselves in a position to really take a hold of the game and probably the biggest disappointment is that we let it slip. At this level that\u2019s not acceptable. We\u2019re really disappointed to have lost that game. \u201cWe had enough class on the pitch to see that game off and go on and take a real stranglehold of it. \u201cWhen you give good sides and good players momentum, there is a good chance they are going to take it. We just weren\u2019t ruthless enough. When the game breaks up and you give them half a sniff, they take it. That\u2019s probably when you have to be more clued in than at any other time in the game because that is when they are the most dangerous: whenever you feel you are out of sight of them.\u201d Best also believes the Lions were harshly dealt with in terms of the refereeing of the scrums in the second-half. \u201cIt was very frustrating,\u201d the hooker said. \u201cWe got penalised rightly for the one that they kicked but there was another couple where their prop was on their knees. All you are really looking for is a bit of consistency and I am not sure we necessarily got it. Having said that, there were probably factors in our control in the scrum that we can do better at and that is what we have to look at. We have to probably be a little more adaptable but it is frustrating. It\u2019s an area of strength for us and I don\u2019t think we are going to let one scrum penalty completely derail us. The boys are disappointed but we can\u2019t lose them because the preparation they can give the guys who play next is essential.\u201d The prop Kyle Sinckler felt the flurry of penalties against the Lions late on ran contrary to the evidence of the game. \u201cThere were no penalties conceded in the scrum for the whole game but then a whole new front-row comes on, the scrum collapses and the referee gives the penalty straight away,\u201d Sinckler said. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make any sense to me, some of the calls. Normally when you have a whole new front-row on, you give it time. \u201cHow can you have dominance? It\u2019s a perception thing. We know we\u2019re going to have our backs against the wall every single game when we\u2019re here and we are going to stick together as a 41-man squad.\u201d Warren Gatland hopes Courtney Lawes (concussion) and Rhys Webb (dead leg) will recover swiftly. \u201cWe\u2019ve probably taken a bit of a step backwards, the coach said. \u201cIt is a dent. The boys said they were reasonably comfortable but unfortunately some big moments got them back into the game. I spoke to the players about learning from those experiences. \u201cIf you come down to New Zealand you need to play for 80 minutes. Unfortunately there were some key moments we didn\u2019t nail. We\u2019ve just been caught on one or two occasions and I think the players will learn from those. It\u2019s about staying alive for every moment. If you do switch off they take advantage.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
