It is more of an unconvincing crawl than a relentless charge for the finishing line, with the recent defeat at Tottenham brutally exposing this team\u2019s deficiencies, but momentum belongs to Arsenal after their strong response to last month\u2019s humiliation at Selhurst Park. Without playing with any particular coherence since that harrowing defeat by Palace, they have willed themselves back into the race through sheer persistence and, whether by luck or design, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s switch to a back three is working. But here comes another test of their infamous mental strength: a trip to the Britannia Stadium on Saturday evening, where Arsenal have not tasted victory since February 2010. As ever, much will depend on Mesut \u00d6zil and Alexis S\u00e1nchez, who combined to devastating effect just when it seemed that Arsenal were running out of ideas against Southampton. JS Wenger wins another small battle in Arsenal\u2019s unlikely civil war 2) The final game at White Hart Lane and Tottenham\u2019s evolution Ask a Manchester United supporter for a favourite White Hart Lane memory and they might shoot back with the late Paul Scholes goal that effectively settled the title race in 2003 or John O\u2019Shea\u2019s comedy goalkeeping cameo in 2007. In the spirit of self-deprecation, William Prunier might get a wistful mention as well. Mostly, though, the one people tend to remember first is the afternoon when Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s side reacted to finding themselves 3-0 down to a Glenn Hoddle outfit at half-time by deciding to score five unanswered goals in the second half. Spurs, it is fair to say, were more Spursy back then. It is difficult to imagine a similar fate befalling a Mauricio Pochettino team now. Not against this version of United anyway; the final ever game at Old White Hart Lane is also the last chance for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s team to score an away goal at a top-six rival this season. Of greater significance than Mourinho\u2019s pragmatism, however, is whether Tottenham are going to show that they have learnt from last season\u2019s capitulation. The title is gone, they can guarantee second place with a win. That would be a fine achievement for this maturing young team. JS Tottenham set for friendly in Hong Kong before starting summer break 3) Liverpool face a test of patience West Ham United are unlikely to veer from the approach that proved so effective against Tottenham when they host Liverpool at the London Stadium on Sunday afternoon. Andr\u00e9 Ayew and Jonathan Calleri pressed high, the midfield hustled with impressive intensity and a gnarly three-man defence sat deep, denying Tottenham space in behind and providing a platform for the scheming Manuel Lanzini to instigate dangerous breaks, and there seems little reason for Slaven Bilic to change his tactics against another top-six side. Too much expansiveness, after all, would play into Liverpool\u2019s hands. J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side are at their best when opponents come at them and prosper against the top sides yet are less inspired when they have to be proactive, which is why they remain in danger of blowing Champions League qualification. Last weekend\u2019s goalless home draw with Southampton was the latest in a long line of disappointing results against smaller teams. There is little room for manoeuvre before the trip to east London and Klopp\u2019s record against Bilic \u2013 two draws and two defeats \u2013 is cause for concern. But while Liverpool have toiled at Anfield recently, they have been better at grinding out wins on the road. Tense one-goal victories at Stoke, Watford and West Brom offer encouragement that they will hold their nerve. JS Klopp unfazed by Barcelona link with Philippe Coutinho 4) A Leicester lead in tale of two Citys Rejuvenated Leicester return to the scene of the finest performance of their title-winning season for Saturday\u2019s lunchtime kick-off and supporters of Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool will be united in hoping they can repeat the heroics that earned them an emphatic win in as good a game of football as there was last season. Plenty has changed in the tale of these two Citys in the interim, but under Craig Shakespeare the champions have been galvanised and can at least be relied upon to be competitive when other teams around them have clearly taken early vacation. Possibly still suffering from the debilitating finger injury he suffered during his side\u2019s defeat by Arsenal last month, Robert Huth is unlikely to repeat his goalscoring heroics of last season. Nevertheless, if Leicester can soak up Manchester City\u2019s pressure, catch them on the break and take the lead in this game it would add further intrigue to an already fascinating race for Champions League qualification. BG Manchester City seek back-up despite Kompany\u2019s sparkling return 5) Will West Brom rouse themselves from end-of-season torpor? Since securing safety with a victory over Arsenal at the Hawthorns in mid-March, West Brom have picked up only two of 18 available points, scored just twice and endured a goal-drought of 531 minutes in duration. With that in mind, it\u2019s difficult to know whether Tottenham Hotspur supporters hoping the Baggies can keep the the title race open by beating Chelsea on Friday night are simply optimistic or delusional. Tony Pulis has promised he and his players are \u201cdoing our damnedest to make it a competitive game and a good game\u201d but their actions will inevitably speak louder than his words. During his time as a Premier League manager at Stoke, Crystal Palace and West Brom, Pulis has consistently preached the importance of reaching the 40-point mark and without exception, his teams have tended to down tools and admire their handiwork once that target has been reached. Pulis has yet to hit the 50-point barrier as a top-flight manager and had a great opportunity to do so this season, but his players appear to lose all motivation once their Premier League futures are assured. Still, footballers are by their nature competitive animals, so it is conceivable West Brom\u2019s will rouse themselves from their end-of-season torpor to give Chelsea a good game just for pig iron. Conceivable but extremely unlikely. BG Conte calls for \u2018one more small step\u2019 after Chelsea beat Middlesbrough 6) Nerves at Selhurst Park It is less than a month since Sam Allardyce was basking in his own magnificence after Crystal Palace\u2019s win over Liverpool. He should have known better \u2013 subsequent defeats by Tottenham, Burnley and City have plunged Palace back into trouble. But, well, y\u2019know. Still, Allardyce remains the ultimate survival expert and he will surely have his team properly prepared for the visit of Hull, who are yet to win an away game since Marco Silva\u2019s arrival in January. Then again, Burnley were winless on their travels before pitching up at Selhurst Park a fortnight ago. Don\u2019t go pouring any pints of wine yet. JS Allardyce warns Palace players about complacency after Man City loss 7) A win for form team in Royals\u2019 play-off with Fulham Form, rather than league position has long been touted as the key to winning Championship play-offs and Reading fans could be excused for swallowing nervously when they discover that in the past 20 years of Championship play-offs, only seven teams who finished third in the table have won promotion. Teams who have finished sixth have gone up by winning the play-off final four times. To get to this year\u2019s nerve-jangling winner-takes-all Wembley showpiece, Reading must overcome Fulham, who finished five points and three places behind them by winning seven of their last nine matches, losing the other two. Curiously, Reading\u2019s record over the past nine games is identical, so if they do fail to win promotion it won\u2019t be for reasons of poor form. BG Slavisa Jokanovic: \u2018I cannot stomp in like an elephant and break everything\u2019 8) Swansea cannot underestimate Sunderland Perhaps it will work to Swansea City\u2019s advantage that Sunderland are on a hot one-game winning streak before their meeting at the Stadium of Light on Saturday. Hull City made the mistake of underestimating Sunderland last weekend, reasoning that David Moyes\u2019s relegated rabble would be easy prey, and they ended up paying the ultimate price. Swansea can consider themselves forewarned. There can be no complacency if they are going to press home their advantage over Hull in the battle to beat the drop. Newcastle made that mistake when they drew 0-0 at Aston Villa, whose relegation had already been confirmed, so Paul Clement must make sure his players are in the right frame of mind. If they are, then Clement can trust in them to do the necessary. JS Swansea City to punish fans who sell player-bought tickets for Sunderland 9) Have Wednesday got the wood on Huddersfield? As if play-offs weren\u2019t tense enough, this semi-final comes with the added spice of being a Yorkshire derby. Sheffield Wednesday finished the season equal on points with Huddersfield and ahead of them on goal difference, but have an excellent recent record against the Terriers. Wednesday are unbeaten in the past seven meetings of the two sides and under Carlos Carvalhal have beaten Huddersfield four times, conceding only one goal in the process. Whether or not this will count for anything in their next two meetings remains to be seen, but Huddersfield\u2019s form has been patchy since their win over Reading in February. In 14 Championship games since, they have registered more defeats than victories and the early and mid-season momentum that propelled them to such dizzy heights under David Wagner has evaporated. A big fan of squad rotation, the German attracted opprobrium for resting his best players once the play-off place was guaranteed. He will need them if they are to get past rivals who have won six of their past seven games. BG Paul Wilson: Huddersfield in hot water but what is a weakened team anyway? 10) Puel needs a win and a goal from Gabbiadini While Southampton are safely ensconced in mid-table, whispers about Claude Puel\u2019s future refuse to go away. Despite leading Southampton to the League Cup final in his first season at St Mary\u2019s, the Frenchman\u2019s position is far from secure and the board is likely to conduct a review soon. With that in mind, Puel could do with throwing a bit of caution to the wind at Middlesbrough on Saturday. Southampton are goalless in four of their past five matches, a run that has done little to silence complaints by supporters that Puel\u2019s style can be unjustifiably cautious, and the previously prolific Manolo Gabbiadini has not found the back of the net since returning from injury last month. Southampton played some neat football in their defeat to Arsenal, but they lack punch in the final third and are not creating enough chances for their Italian striker.
