The two have become firm friends and Hatton, a Manchester City fan, was determined the United striker should have the honour despite criticism from some City followers. After sitting alongside the champion on the podium after the fight, a smiling Rooney said: \"I was terribly nervous, more so than when I pull on an England shirt. The atmosphere was fantastic. To see so many people coming from England was unbelievable.\" Rooney added that he had been just as excited as the rest of Hatton's fans. \"I was jumping up and down. Ricky's a hero of mine. I've been watching him since I used to watch my cousin Richie box when he was seven or eight and Ricky was on the same show.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
