In headlines that Ken Livingstone could once only have dreamed of, the People's Daily in Beijing enthusiastically reported the fact that London's mayor had made the London Eye bloodshot with crimson light to celebrate a remarkable new display of Chinese power. As Ken well knew, though, his painting the town red was symbolic of bloody tooth and claw economics rather than any kind of cultural revolution. At the Royal Academy, Hu Jintao, the Chinese premier, dressed immaculately for business, posed in front of the sumptuous dragon robes of Qing dynasty emperors, one decorated with 9,000 pieces of Swarovski crystal. The Queen was there, too, but she was outdazzled by the exhibits. The whole event, one of the most memorable pieces of PR imaginable, had been made possible by Goldman Sachs, the investment bank which, as Norman Rosenthal of the Royal Academy explained, 'is pursuing its own agenda in China' and sponsoring the exhibition. These days, the yuan signs are flashing in the eyes of all British businessmen. Qing, we are informed, is pronounced Ching or, in this case, you suspect, ka-ching. China suddenly dominates our ideas of the future, so it is a good time to remind ourselves of some of its past. The Three Emperors show demonstrates an extraordinary expression of what Chinese economic and military power has been capable of. In the golden age of the Qing dynasty, the three imperial rulers - the Kangxi emperor (1662-1722), the Yongzheng emperor (1723-35) and the Qianlong emperor (1736-95) - singlemindedly unified and extended the borders of the Chinese nation into lands west and north, to include vast areas of central Asia and Mongolia, enforcing the dominance of the Forbidden City in 58 ethnic kingdoms. They were the first of the Manchus and they drove the Ming dynasty from its seats of power. Still, it is their spirit of poetry and enlightenment, the fruits of the Hall of Supreme Harmony and the Pavilion of Literary Profundity, that they wanted to be remembered for. It is also, happily, this spirit of the 'peaceful emergence' of superpower, that Mr Hu and the investment banks are keen to dwell on (while skipping over the fact, for example, of the Qing commitment to Tibetan Buddhism). Given the martial brilliance of the Manchu banner troops, there are remarkably few warlike images in the 400 or so exquisite items on show, which are borrowed almost in their entirety from what was the Imperial Palace and is now the Palace Museum in Beijing. The Qing were men of the people or so they wanted the people to think. There are propaganda pictures of crown prince Yinzhen, the future Yongzheng emperor, ladling manure on to rice paddies or sitting in a coolie hat by the river or just 'admiring the flowers'. Each of these interpretations of his romantic humility is exquisitely crafted on silk. Despite their contrivance, the prince, or an imperial spin doctor's vision of him, still comes keenly to life. You can well imagine his eye straying across the fine lines and intricate silks of The Twelve Beauties at Leisure, painted for Prince Yinzhen, a mesmerising album of coy mistresses, toying with beads or running their fingertips over fans. Dame Jessica Rawson, the chief curator of the show, suggested at the opening: 'We do not know who they are or what they were for', but you could have a pretty good guess. One of the things that this extraordinary collection of objects reveals and celebrates is the cross-cultural links that the Qing sponsored. The Shunzhi emperor realised the value of winning over the educated Han Chinese elite and, to this end, encouraged the foremost scholars and artists to court, including Jesuit missionaries. Chief among the latter was Guiseppi Castiglione, operating under the Chinese name Lang Shining, who was born in Milan and studied painting with Italian masters before leaving for Beijing in 1715. At court, he developed a seductive, hybrid Sino-European painting style, literally bringing a Western perspective to Chinese decorative subjects, in particular in a series of remarkable portraits of the later emperors. So persuasive were Castiglione and his missionaries, in their aesthetics, if not in their Catholicism, that the emperors started to adopt Milanese habits. There is a curious portrait of the Yongzheng emperor in a frock coat and pomaded wig fighting a tiger. (The appeal apparently persists: witness Mr Hu in his version of Armani.) As their hold on power settled into a tradition the Qing realised they could commission and create pretty much anything they wanted. There are peacock-tailed sundials and clocks in the shape of cranes; snuff dishes like lotus leaves on which crabs clasp chrysanthemums; unbelievable porcelain still-lifes. Much of the most exquisite craftsmanship was reserved for the paraphernalia of calligraphy - jade paint pots and ink wells, little brush rests in the shape of mountains or peach trees. The emperors were poets and artists, as well as warriors, and all of these attributes came together in their script. The third, Qianlong emperor, in particular, took supreme pleasure in the perfection of his hand: 'Such delight gives order to words,' he writes, 'coming from the clouds./ The archery field is so clear and bright, one can see each arrow./ See how far they go - how could our pleasure be merely at this!' The clear brush strokes of a haiku were replicated in the supreme order and pageantry of depictions of court. Among all the grandeur here, some of the most compelling work lies in the detail of the huge tapestry-like silk scrolls depicting life in the Forbidden City. Here are the Chinese as we expect them, en masse, uniformed in rich silks of red and blue; hundreds and thousands of them celebrating the Kangxhi emperor's 60th birthday or speed- skating in vast, unwieldy teams on the imperial lake. The longer you look, the more you realise that these crowd scenes are anything but faceless. Each tiny and apparently regimented member of the group, perfectly in his place like a line in a calligrapher's script, is individually drawn, full of expression; the result is an extremely rareified kind of Where's Wally? You can play this game, too, with Chinese images of a very different sort at the Flowers East gallery. Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky's pictures of contemporary Shanghai also dwell on massed, uniformed individuals who stretch as far as the eye can see, but these are the servants of a very different kind of empire; the one, you might say, that is represented by Mr Hu and increasingly bankrolled by the likes of Goldman Sachs. They are the workers in electronics components hangars, each one the size of an imperial palace, or machinists in garment metropolises, footsoldiers in the 'bra wars'. They separate easily into ones and twos the more you look. But step back and they come together in monochrome all the way to their vanishing point. The visions of the two exhibitions are intimately connected or, at least, you suspect that you wouldn't have one without the other."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
