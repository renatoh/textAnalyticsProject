It's on a par with, say, converting Ukip to the merits of the EU, a project that effectively defies its reason to exist. The man who talked motorsport's governing body, the FIA, into a complete redesign of both the engine and the body of F1 cars this season is its boss, the Frenchman Jean Todt. Cannily, he dismissed any namby-pamby chat about benefit to the environment of a read-across from the racetrack to the family saloon, preferring to stress the need for his sport to stay at the forefront of technological innovation.
