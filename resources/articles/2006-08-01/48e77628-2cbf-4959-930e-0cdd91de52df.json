Jordan has had turbulent relationships with a string of Palace managers and is embroiled in a legal battle with Taylor's predecessor, the Charlton manager Iain Dowie, over his reasons for leaving Selhurst Park this summer. \"I honestly don't see the situation with Simon as a massive problem,\" said Taylor, who will meet Steve McClaren today to discuss his future as the England Under-21 manager. \"I think the relationship between the chairman and manager is very important, and I'm going to work very hard to see that we have a good relationship. Simon is outspoken, which I'm sure the press quite enjoy, but if that's what he feels he says it and gets it off his chest.\" Palace are desperate to fill the void left by Andy Johnson's \u00a38.6m move to Everton. \"We've got to replace Andy, although I don't think you're ever going to properly replace somebody with his pace and the way he could score goals,\" Taylor added. \"We need to get somebody in who can score us 20 goals or has done that. \"But every manager knows that if you play against Andy Johnson you defend deep and I think that's what happened in the end. I've always quite liked a big striker with a sharp one to get over problems like that. We've got to find the goals from somewhere but hopefully we can score different types of goals and score enough.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
