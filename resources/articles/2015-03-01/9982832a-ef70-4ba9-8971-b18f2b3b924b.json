Otherwise there is still a big missing chunk in his recollection of his last game for England, sandwiched between knowing he was struggling to catch an Italian high ball and waking up in the medical room with a sore head. It is the rest of us who can recall every detail of one of Twickenham\u2019s nastier modern collisions. Brown being Brown, what hurt most was having to miss the subsequent Ireland game while he went through the painstaking return-to-play protocols that all concussion victims must now complete. Before sense prevailed, he admits he was tempted to lie about feeling better in a desperate effort to retain his place in Dublin. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t so aware of the implications and the dangers ... yeah, I probably would have,\u201d he says. \u201cPulling out is one of the worst things I\u2019ve ever had to go through in my whole life. As a sportsman everything you work towards is pulling on your country\u2019s jersey. If it wasn\u2019t for the awareness courses we\u2019ve been on, I probably wouldn\u2019t have done so. I wouldn\u2019t have done myself justice, would have put myself in danger and it wouldn\u2019t have been good.\u201d He says it so matter-of-factly it is possible to underestimate his honesty, at a time when the issue of concussion management has never been bigger. Anyone seeking a glimpse into the mindset of an international player may just have found the most fascinating case study of the lot. While Brown, at 14st 7lb, is not the biggest of players, his commitment is other-worldly. The days of mad, crazy\u2011fool bravado are supposedly over, but strength of character can still take you places the sane never go. Which at least partially explains why, at 7.30am on the Friday morning after the Italy game, Brown sat on his bed seriously contemplating keeping quiet about the headaches he had experienced during the night. \u201cI\u2019ve trained through headaches before \u2013 not from concussion but through being dehydrated \u2013 so I could definitely have trained on and seen how it went,\u201d he says. In that event he could have played against Ireland but, ultimately, the fear of letting down his team-mates outweighed all else. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been good preparation for the team if I\u2019d pulled out late. We speak about being truthful, telling the medical team how you\u2019re feeling and the risks that go with not letting people know. That was enough for me to pull out.\u201d Unsurprisingly, he has yet to watch the Italy match but one or two kind people have sent him clips of the incident. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a couple of pictures of the hit, which was nice: great facials and then asleep on the floor,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it happens in rugby. It\u2019s a collision sport. I remember having my eye on the ball and at the last minute realising I couldn\u2019t get there to catch or compete for it myself. Then I went for the tackle and that\u2019s it. I only came round fully in the medical room. One of the first things I said when I could speak was: \u2018Let my fiancee know.\u2019 I was quite proud of myself.\u201d As it turned out England\u2019s backroom staff had already reassured Eliza, the daughter of the former England footballer Tony Woodcock, that he was fine. She was able to ring family members and tell them that long before the battered full-back reappeared on the bench to a huge ovation. It is one of the occupational hazards, from Eliza\u2019s point of view, of having a partner who fears very little other than losing. This is a man who, after being inadvertently locked in her flat one morning, jumped out of a first-floor window to get to training. Watching the Ireland game almost drove him to distraction. \u201cEliza was trying to calm me down but I wasn\u2019t having it,\u201d he says. \u201cI was fuming. I wasn\u2019t happy at all. It wasn\u2019t something I want to be doing too regularly, sat in my lounge on the edge of my sofa, screaming at the TV. I had to have a quiet moment to myself at half-time. It wasn\u2019t a good day. Unfortunately, my fiancee had to go through it with me.\u201d No wonder Stuart Lancaster, when asked this week to single out the 29-year-old\u2019s best quality, plumped for his \u201cwinner\u2019s mentality\u201d above everything else. \u201cWhen it comes down to the fine margins on selection \u2013 technically, tactically, physically \u2013 the intangible is that and he has it,\u201d Lancaster said. \u201cEven though he is not that vocal off the field, his sheer competitiveness is what you want in your team.\u201d Brown is not entirely convinced \u2013 \u201cI think Stuart just means I get grumpy if I don\u2019t get my own way\u201d \u2013 but ask him if he thinks Celtic players are more passionate than the English and his eyes glitter. \u201cDefinitely not. I love playing for my country. It\u2019s everything I\u2019ve worked towards and it means so much it\u2019s hard to put into words. I try and bring that into every performance when I\u2019m lucky enough to wear the jersey.\u201d That shows during the anthems, never mind the game. It has been a long road to Twickenham from his early comprehensive school days in Salisbury. His parents split up when he was 12 and his father, Mick, formerly with the fire service, now struggles to get to matches because of his multiple sclerosis. There is plenty to think about in those emotional moments before kick-off. \u201cMy fiancee is usually sat in the family section right opposite me,\u201d Brown says. \u201cI pick her out first and then I try and look up at the highest point I can see, pick out a white jersey and sing the anthem as proud as I can. You try not to get too emotional because that can have an effect on your performance.\u201d And when the first high ball heads his way against Scotland on Saturday? Will he flinch inside? \u201cI don\u2019t think so. It hasn\u2019t been an issue in training. The way I play I can\u2019t afford to do that because it would take so much away from my game. I think I\u2019m 100% committed every time I\u2019m going for a ball. Hopefully, I will just switch into automatic mode and won\u2019t think too much of it.\u201d When it comes to mind over matter, there are few to match him.
