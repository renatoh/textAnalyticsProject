The Villa manager effectively sacrificed the Uefa Cup campaign in February when he left eight first-team players behind for the trip to Russia to prioritise a top-four finish in the Premier League, prompting an angry response from a section of the club's supporters. A further backlash followed when Villa's season unravelled domestically but O'Neill maintains that he acted in the best interests of the club in Moscow and claims that the reaction from some fans has been over the top. \"I have never seen something rumble on so long in my life,\" said the Villa manager ahead of tonight's Europa League final qualifying round, first leg against Rapid Vienna in Austria. \"I don't see the logic attached to the endless criticism that we received. It really is mind-blowing that people are looking to that to explain what happened at the end of last season.\" The Villa manager's immediate focus is to restore confidence following Saturday's chastening defeat to Wigan Athletic and ensure that the Midlands club reach the group stage of the Europa League. He is, however, conscious of the pressing need to strengthen what remains a threadbare squad and acknowledged that the arrival of several new faces before the transfer window closes at the end of the month is paramount if Villa are to be able to handle the demands of a European campaign. \"It is key,\" said O'Neill, who is understood to be interested in signing West Ham's England defender Matthew Upson although Villa have yet to make a bid. \"We have some time in which to [make signings], and that is my full intention. We were hoping to have been able to do something before now. I am not saying for one minute that these players will be available for the Liverpool game [on Monday], but whatever the case, by the time the transfer window ends, we would [hope to] have added some strength in depth.\" O'Neill has promised to make changes here following the insipid performance against Wigan, with John Carew, the Norway striker who was ruled out last Saturday because of an infected toe, expected to return to the attack. Villa will be guaranteed six further European matches if they can defeat the Austrian runners-up over two legs and, although O'Neill believes the competition should have been streamlined when it was rebranded, he is keen to get through. \"It would be great for us to make it,\" he said. \"I would like to have the availability of players to have a go at it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
