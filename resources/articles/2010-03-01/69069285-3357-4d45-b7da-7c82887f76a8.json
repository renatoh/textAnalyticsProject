The England flanker had been ordered to go back to Paris to prepare for the Top 14 match against Toulouse at the Stade de France. The Rugby Football Union refused to let him go, though, saying the player's lawyer had confirmed a release clause for any and all of the elite player scheme periods. However, the Stade Fran\u00e7ais president, Max Guazzini, said that applied only to extra training weeks before the autumn internationals and Six Nations and that Haskell was contractually obliged to report for training with the club. Guazzini would not specify what \"consequences\" Haskell will face, but his international career could be jeopardised. Stade could take action for alleged breach of contract or tell England that if they want the player for next season's fourth autumn international against New Zealand in December, the fallow weekends during the 2011 Six Nations and pre-World Cup training camps, they will have to agree a compensation package, something the RFU have said they will not do. \"Our contract with James Haskell allows him to attend England's training week before the autumn internationals and the Six Nations, but it is not true that he is available to England for the duration of the Six Nations,\" Guazzini said. \"He is not respecting his contract, but is under pressure from the RFU and he is in a difficult position because they said if he came back to us they would kick him out of the team. They are keeping him a prisoner. The refusal to release James is against the rules and it is immoral. \"Haskell is one of the faces on our posters around the city [Paris] and I like him a lot. He is someone I respect and he has integrated very well into the club. But there will be consequences after this.\" Stade, who are outside the places that will bring Heineken Cup rugby next season, never mind the play-off positions, wanted Haskell, who was confined to his room with a virus on Thursday, to face Toulouse because they have injury problems in the back row and used his image to help promote a game that is expected to be an 80,000 sell-out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
