'I've taken a lot of flak tonight,' Richmond told fans last week. 'I'm an unpaid consultant until the summer and there's no arrangement for anything beyond that.' He still needs to convince industry sources close to the club - who remain sure Richmond will take the position in the close-season, on a 'healthy' salary. At least it's love. 'Although the end at Bradford left me broken-hearted,' says Richmond, 'my heart is being mended by Leeds.' Numbers game: \u00a33,370: The cost of a 20-year Leeds United season ticket under Gerald Krasner's plan to raise \u00a310million in vital revenue from supporters to secure the club's future. 20: the number of 20-year season tickets Mark Viduka could buy on one week's Leeds wages. Love this country: Sven-Goran Eriksson, February: 'I am amazed and surprised every time this comes up. I have a contract. People seem to have forgotten that I have a contract until 2006 and nothing has been changed from that. I think you think about it much more than I do...' Peter Kenyon, March: 'This wave of unprecedented and continuous speculation and false managerial links is unhelpful... It is one and one making four. It's damaging for the club, and the game.' Read my lips: Peter Winkleman says he won't rush into a new name for his franchise: 'I'll be talking with the authorities and to other interested parties about the future name of Wimbledon FC. No decisions have yet been taken.' It's a big pledge from a man who quietly registered both 'mkdons.com' and 'mkdons.co.uk' domain names in June 2000 So farewell then... Alan Brazil, sacked by Talksport for being too drunk to broadcast. Career highlights: tells listeners a boat full of asylum-seekers 'should be sunk'; reveals British regional accents were disappearing because of 'too many immigrants'; tells listeners on 12 September 2001: 'I wonder how all those politically correct people are feeling this morning?' But it wasn't all serious politics. Brazil: 'I was sad to hear yesterday about the death of Inspector Morse, TV's John Shaw.' Co-host: 'John Thaw, Alan.' Brazil: 'Do you know, I've been doing that all morning. John, if you're listening, sorry mate.' Rio: Head bowed: Rio Ferdinand says he can't handle the spotlight. 'I'm beginning to realise what it's like being in the public eye. It's not for me. You become public property - that kind of experience isn't nice.' So more misery for bashful Rio last week: 'Rio In Drunken Orgy. Shamed soccer star Rio Ferdinand filmed himself in a raunchy sex romp with TWO beauties - then showed the video to his mates...' Ottmar dark: Ottmar Hitzfeld, under pressure at Bayern ('he's not very satisfying', say sources) has turned to a priest for spiritual cleansing. 'It's necessary,' Ottmar told the tabs. 'My soul needs support at this difficult time.' 'I have to be with him in his darkness,' says priest Josef Hochstrasser. 'The air around him has never been so thin.' Talking foreign: Biggest problem for a Premiership gaffer? 'I left a couple of my foreigners out last week and they started talking in foreign,' says Harry Redknapp in FHM . 'I knew they were saying \"Blah, blah, blah, le bastard manager...\" It's hard. I'd suggest a golf day but you ask a Yugoslav and he doesn't even know what golf is. I'd take them to the army camp for pre-season and my Serb player would shoot my Croatian and my Russian would be spying on everybody...' What's wrong with football: This week: Borussia Dortmund star Torsten Frings, accused of 'insensitivity' towards the cash-strapped club and its fans after buying a car too big to fit into the club's car park. 'The club crumbles, but life is good for the players,' says Bild. Frings new 'Hummer 2', as seen in The Terminator, weighs three tons. 'I'm not showing off,' Frings told the tabs. 'It is a great machine.' Bloody Rambo: Eintracht Frankfurt coach Willi Reimann has shrugged off a five-match ban for attacking officials during their 2-0 defeat to Dortmund. 'I was just defending myself,' says Reimann. 'There was no need for the ref to stand there with his chest out like some bloody Rambo.' 'It was really nothing,' Dortmund coach Mattias Sammer told the tabs. 'The ref reacted as if he'd been grabbed by the balls and pulled...' Cats: Not guilty: Atletico Rafaela fans have executed a litter of cats they blamed for a 2-0 defeat. The cats, which lived under a stand, had appeared on the pitch just before a crucial penalty incident. 'It is sick. I'm the one who should be blamed for our poor run of form,' says coach Osvaldo Piazza. 'Me, and the players. What is undeniable is this: those cats were innocent.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
