RESULT OF THE DAY On an afternoon of four- and five-goal spankings, Wigan's 4-1 away mauling of play-off rivals Forest stands out. Uwe R\u00f6sler has won nine of his 14 games in charge. SURPRISE OF THE DAY The following two events being unrelated: 1) A technical area dust-up featuring a middle-aged man launching a head-butt; And 2) Duncan Ferguson making his debut as a coach on Everton's bench. LIVELIEST DAY OUT Yeovil's trip to Reading \u2013 three red cards not putting them off their stride as they held on for an unlikely, vital 1-1 draw. Manager Gary Johnson said his players were \"a bit overzealous\", but \"not vicious\". TWIST OF THE DAY Came in Germany: both keepers scoring own goals as Braunschweig drew 1-1 with Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach. SADDEST COMEDOWN Five years ago Notts County were lining up \u00a32m-a-year Sven-Goran Eriksson to head a big-money drive for the Premier League. On Saturday, League One's bottom club lost 6-0 at Rotherham. HYDE WATCH Another Saturday, another heartbreak for the Conference strugglers. Cruising to a rare, spirit-raising away point, Hyde shipped the winner at Braintree with six minutes left to play. And a red card too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
