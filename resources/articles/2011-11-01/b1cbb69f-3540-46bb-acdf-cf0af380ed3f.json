The occupation was served with an eviction notice last week, giving demonstrators until 12.01am Monday to leave their city hall park encampment. Thousands responded by protesting at the camp on Sunday night, spilling over into streets surrounding the park. Police arrested four people but did not clear the encampment, which remained intact on Monday afternoon. \"As the mayor and Chief Beck said last week and in a statement last night, the park closed at 12.01am today,\" a spokesman for Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa told the Guardian. \"The protesters are being given ample time to remove their belongings and leave the park, and it is the mayor's hope that the closure continues peacefully. Those who remain in the park are subject to enforcement and arrest at any time.\" The Los Angeles police department arrested four people at Occupy LA on Monday morning on suspicion of unlawful assembly. Between 200 and 300 police officers were deployed to the area surrounding City Hall park just after 12 midnight on Monday, but an LAPD public relations officer said the action had not been an effort to evict the occupation. \"We did not force them to leave the camp: [the police presence was] to let them know that it was illegal as of 12.01 to stay there,\" said officer Rosario Herrera. \"All we did was enforce the streets to make sure people were not illegally blocking the streets.\" She said police \"don't have a date\" as to when they will clear the camp. \"We're going to do it in a timely manner, but we do not know when that is going to occur. They know that they're not supposed to stay overnight, but as of right now we have not enforced anything.\" The LAPD was still deciding \"what method they're going to choose\" to enforce the notice, Herrara said. \"There's a lot of homeless people out in Occupy LA so we have to make sure that they have resources as to where to go.\" Police surrounded Occupy LA's camp for six hours on Monday before withdrawing at about 6.30am, prompting celebrations from protesters, who chanted: \"We won, we won.\" The standoff remained relatively peaceful through the night, with only four arrests, as police cleared surrounding streets for morning rush-hour traffic. \"People from California are supporting the last long-standing encampment in this country,\" said Mary Walker, 22, who was lying down on 1st Street in protest. Others like Oceana Christopher, 31, attempted to form a human chain link in case police officers decided to raid the camp site. \"I believe in what Occupy Los Angeles is doing and I don't want them to stop fight for everything they believe in,\" she said. Just before dawn, commander Andrew Smith walked around the protest area with an Occupy Los Angeles official, and told protesters to clear the streets or risk arrest. Later, commander John Sherman warned people to clear the intersections around City Hall, especially the intersection of 1st and Main, or face arrest or non-lethal tactics. Amid chants of \"Whose street? Our street\" and \"Police go home\", those remaining on the intersection stayed put for a few minutes until police officers pushed many back to the pavements. By 6am, police slowly backed away from 1st Street as protesters calmed down, but hundreds of people still remain camped at the Occupy site."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
