However, First Choice's financial advisers, which include UBS, are thought to have drafted tentative plans for an offer that will be examined by the company's chief executive Peter Long and finance director, Andrew Martin within the next few weeks. 'This is a merger that has to happen, and now that MyTravel has sorted out its accounts, its a question of when rather than if,' said an industry source. First Choice and Airtours tried to merge three years ago, but the deal was blocked by EU competition authorities. Since then the regulator has eased the criteria by which any future marriage would be judged. Competition lawyers in London said a tie-up would almost certainly be allowed this time. There are no formal talks between the two companies, and MyTravel's new chief executive, Peter McHugh, said: 'I am going to undertake a wide-ranging review of the group's activities; my objective is to make it a profitable, thriving concern that can compete in the international travel market.' Pressed on whether MyTravel could eventually sell to a rival such as First Choice, McHugh replied: 'It is something that will be taken into account. We don't rule it out, but nor do we rule it in.' McHugh, who is widely respected in the industry, wants to boost MyTravel's stock market value -- a paltry \u00a3166 million - in order to get a decent price for shareholders if a bid materialises. For his part, Long at First Choice may want to delay any deal until after a war with Iraq, which could have disastrous consequences for the travel industry if the conflict is prolonged and bloody. Nevertheless, the signs are that forward bookings are looking good. Last week, TUI of Germany, Europe's largest travel company, said there had been a surge of bookings despite worries about security. MyTravel, which has been hit by a disastrous trading year and worries about its aggressive accounting policies, disclosed last week that it had dived into the red for the first time in 30 years. But McHugh said it had enough cash to survive, and that the firm had overhauled its accounting procedures. Under chief executive Tim Byrne, MyTravel's shares crashed after several profits warnings and Byrne was forced to resign. The company's founder and chairman David Crossland has delayed his departure as part of a bid to sort out the company's problems. But he will be replaced in January as chairman by Eric Sanderson, non-executive deputy chairman. MyTravel last year recorded pre-tax losses of \u00a372.8m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
