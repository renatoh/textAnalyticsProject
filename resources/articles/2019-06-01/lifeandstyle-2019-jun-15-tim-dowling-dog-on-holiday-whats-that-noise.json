So what\u2019s that noise?", "bodyText": "Just before lunchtime on Saturday, the oldest one arrives with three of his friends in a small, fully packed car. They are off to Cornwall on holiday, and they have come to collect a stack of board games in preparation for a week that promises only rain. They\u2019re also taking the dog. My wife had tried to dissuade them \u2013 questioning, I suppose, the ability of four male twentysomethings to keep an animal alive for a week \u2013 but I was in favour. They\u2019re ready to set off, but I can\u2019t find the dog\u2019s lead, even after looking in all the usual places twice. The dog follows me anxiously as I search. \u201cYou\u2019ll meet new people,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fun.\u201d What I mean, of course, is that it will be fun for me. I can\u2019t wait to spend a week without a dog that barks whenever the doorbell rings and has a habit of leaping into my lap without warning several times a day because its need for attention has suddenly reached the status of emergency. I call my wife about the dog lead. \u201cI lost it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt fell off my neck while I was in the park.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re about to leave,\u201d I say. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m stuck in traffic,\u201d she says. \u201cGive them a bit of string or something.\u201d In the end they take a long, non-official Chelsea scarf to use until a new lead can be sourced. I watch them load the car with games and foodstuffs from my kitchen. The oldest one gets into the back, dog on lap, and the car executes a stately three-point turn. The rear window rolls down, and my son\u2019s friend sticks his head out. \u201cThere\u2019s room for one more, Tim,\u201d he says. \u201cNo thanks,\u201d I say. I walk back up the path and shut the door behind me. I hear nothing but a gentle ringing in my ears. The cat comes out of the sitting room, looks up at me and miaows. \u201cShut up,\u201d I say. When my wife returns home I barely notice, because there is no dog to go into rapturous hysterics at her arrival. \u201cHow\u2019s my lunch coming?\u201d she says. \u201cI haven\u2019t started,\u201d I say. \u201cYou said 1.30pm.\u201d \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d she says. The youngest one walks in, fresh from bed. \u201cMorning,\u201d my wife says. \u201cWhere\u2019s the dog?\u201d he says. \u201cThe dog is on holiday,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd so am I.\u201d I wake up late the next morning, without a dog on my feet. My wife is already up and dressed. I go downstairs to drink coffee and watch her garden. We tend not to garden together, because the plot is divided into our separate sectors of responsibility, with many contested boundaries. I hear a noise above my head, like the talons of a large eagle brushing the floorboards. The noise moves right to left and pours down the stairs. A moment later, a small pointed head peers round the kitchen door. \u201cBilly,\u201d I say. Billy is a permanently embarrassed lurcher whose outlines are blurred by a nimbus of rough grey fur. He\u2019s not our dog \u2013 he belongs to the youngest one\u2019s friend, who evidently spent the night \u2013 but he knows his way around the house. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Billy,\u201d I say. Billy\u2019s sad, black eyes fix me with a look that says: Oh, Christ. I\u2019m so sorry. \u201cOur dog isn\u2019t here, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d I say. \u201cGone on holiday.\u201d Billy studies the floor with an expression that seems to say: this is awkward. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I say. \u201cCan I get you some water?\u201d I fill the dog\u2019s bowl and set it down. Billy regards it with boundless mortification, as if thinking: really, I just couldn\u2019t. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Billy,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019re my kind of house guest.\u201d Billy canters to the back door, rearing his head like a mortified pony. \u201cOutside?\u201d I say. \u201cNo problem.\u201d I open the door and he walks gingerly across the grass to a flowering peony. He sniffs it, and then lifts his leg. My wife looks round. \u201cBilly!\u201d she says. Without lowering his leg, Billy manages to turn his head all the way round to me. His eyes, peering out from his cloudy head, seem to say: this isn\u2019t going well."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
