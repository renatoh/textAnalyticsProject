The Wales captain has emerged as a leading target for the new Everton manager, Ronald Koeman, and director of football, Steve Walsh, and a deal between all parties is believed to have been agreed in principle. Koeman, who is yet to sign an outfield player since replacing Roberto Mart\u00ednez at Goodison Park, is looking to rebuild his central defence with John Stones expected to join Manchester City and Phil Jagielka missing much of pre-season because of a hamstring problem. He is keen to add experience and physical presence to the Everton defence and will want two new centre-halves should City meet Everton\u2019s \u00a350m valuation of Stones. Williams meets those requirements and, despite enjoying a highly successful career with Swansea, is tempted by the prospect of a fresh start on Merseyside. The 31-year-old, who led Wales to the semi-finals of the European Championship, was a target for Brendan Rodgers during his time as the Liverpool manager and Arsenal have also registered interest in the former Stockport County defender in the past. Swansea\u2019s openness to the Everton approach represents a surprise so close to the new Premier League season but the deal will yield a healthy profit on a player signed for \u00a3300,000 in 2008. Williams has two years remaining on his contract at the Liberty Stadium. Everton were also thought to be keen on Gylfi Sigurdsson, but this ended on Tuesday when the 26-year-old signed a new four-year contract. \u201cDelighted to have signed a new 4 year deal with @swansofficial,\u201d the Icelandic midfielder posted on social media. \u201cLooking forward to the new season!\u201d Everton have also registered interest with Napoli in Senegal defender Kalidou Koulibaly, although that was before Walsh\u2019s arrival from Leicester City, and in the Aston Villa midfielder Idrissa Gueye. The club could raise in excess of \u00a3100m through the sales of Stones and Romelu Lukaku this summer but, despite the Belgium international being linked with a return to Chelsea, Everton have yet to receive an offer from Stamford Bridge for their leading striker."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
