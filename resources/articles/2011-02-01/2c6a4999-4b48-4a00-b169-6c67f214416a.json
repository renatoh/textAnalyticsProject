The 25-year-old, who signed from Hoffenheim for a minimal fee that rises dependent on appearances and goals, claimed both his goals in the 3-3 draw at West Bromwich Albion. \"He is a very good player,\" Grant said. \"I followed him for a long time in the German league. He always scored, he is always moving. He is good and he is not in the best shape yet because he had a break from 21 December and we are building him slowly, slowly. \"It is very difficult to mark him and he hits the target. That is what you want from a striker. I think twice they cleared off the line. I think this is the most important thing for a striker. Movement and hit the target \u2013 and that is what he did. And he can play anywhere \u2013 right, left, behind.\" Ba, who scored 37 times in 97 games for Hoffenheim, should feature on Monday against Burnley in the FA Cup and Grant believes that the Senegal forward is conscious of the \"magic\" associated with the competition. \"Yes he is aware. He knows about it. I was in contact with him for a long time and he is a player that is interested in everything,\" the manager said. \"Don't think only people in England know about the FA Cup. \"After we got to the semi-final [when manager of Portsmouth] last year I got calls from [all over] the world \u2013 everybody follows the FA Cup, more than any cup in the world. In other countries [the cup] is not so important but here it is connected to tradition and everybody wants to be at Wembley. At Portsmouth last year the players who came from other countries were even more excited just to be in the semi-final.\" Ba nearly signed for Stoke City in January before failing a medical but he claims fitness is not an issue. \"I have always said from the beginning, the only answer I can give is on the pitch and that is what I did [at West Brom] and I will try to do it for the next couple of weeks now,\" he said. \"I am very happy. It has been a while since I played from the beginning of a game. I am very tired as well because I didn't think that I could play for 90 minutes. At the moment, I am excited about every game we play. It doesn't matter if it is Liverpool or West Brom, we try to do everything to win the game.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
