Wild Oats took one day 18hrs 40min 10sec and was 15 miles ahead of the pre-race favourite, Neville Crichton's Alfa Romeo, which had Britain's Ben Ainslie as one of her helmsmen. Wild Oats' mainsail became unusable after it was holed by a batten broken during a gybe. Light winds had slowed the fleet on Monday night, diminishing expectations for a race record, but strong winds in Bass Strait yesterday helped the bigger yachts speed up down the Tasmanian coast. Oatley's navigator Adrienne Cahalan called the winning strategy, heading close to the direct line, whereas Alfa Romeo went further east. A total of 85 yachts started the current race and the only retirement late last night was a German entry, Conergy. An estimated 400,000 people watched from the shores of Sydney's harbour as Wild Oats led Alfa Romeo out of The Heads on Monday. Thousands more watched in Hobart as Wild Oats finished."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
