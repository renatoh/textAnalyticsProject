The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has arrived in Auckland to meet his Kiwi counterpart, John Key, as a cross-Tasman storm on immigration issues intensifies. Kelvin Davis, the New Zealand Labour party spokesman for justice and corrections, has told Guardian Australia that the federal government\u2019s decision to cancel visas for long-term residents who have been sentenced to one or more years in Australian prisons makes a \u201cmockery\u201d of the special Anzac relationship. \u201cI think it\u2019s an embarrassment for Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cThe harm that\u2019s been done by this policy outweighs any good it does to Australia.\u201d Eighty New Zealand citizens have been deported since December, when the government introduced changes to the migration act allowing for the automatic cancellation of visas. Scott Morrison, who was immigration minister at the time the changes came in, but who now holds the job of treasurer, told reporters on Friday that visa holders are in Australia \u201cat the good graces of the Australian people\u201d. \u201cAt the end of the day, if you\u2019re here on a visa and you\u2019ve committed sexual assault, if you\u2019re a gangster, if you\u2019re a bikie gang member, if you\u2019ve engaged in physical assault or murder or something like that, you\u2019ve worn out your welcome in this country,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cI don\u2019t care how long you\u2019ve been here. You\u2019ve worn out your welcome if you\u2019re here on a visa.\u201d But Davis refuted that classification. He said New Zealanders who served short jail sentences for petty crimes and those who have been charged with a crime but given suspended sentences, make up the bulk of those awaiting deportation. \u201cThey\u2019re people you\u2019d have a beer with in the pub,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not the murderers and rapists [they\u2019re made out to be].\u201d The Australian and New Zealand Greens have lodged a complaint with the Australian Human Rights Commission on the policy. Australian Greens senator, Sarah Hanson-Young, has labelled it \u201carbitrary\u201d. \u201cThe automatic nature of these visa cancellations mean that we don\u2019t just have people who have served prison time for serious crimes,\u201d Hanson-Young told reporters on Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get real here. This includes people with traffic offences, who have been caught shoplifting.\u201d David said that high-risk offenders are not separated from low-risk ones in immigration detention, recalling the story of a young man who had been sexually abused in his childhood being forced to share a room with a convicted paedophile. \u201cThey\u2019re just being thrown in [to immigration detention centres],\u201d he said, describing the visa cancellations as \u201ccallous\u201d and showing \u201ca lack of humanity\u201d. Davis met with families of New Zealand detainees currently awaiting deportation from Sydney\u2019s Villawood facility on Thursday and Friday. On Friday night he flies to Christmas Island to try and make contact with detainees in the notorious immigration detention centre there. Key has vowed to have a \u201cblunt\u201d and \u201cdirect\u201d conversation with Turnbull about the visa cancellation issue, but Davis said that Key was too busy \u201cbeing Mr Guy\u201d to strongly put forward the case for New Zealand citizens to the Australian prime minister. Key has previously warned against strong-arming the Australian government. \u201cThe one thing I would say is we need to negotiate with these guys, not put them in an armlock, because if we try to put Malcolm in an armlock, what will end up happening is he will actually have to face the domestic politics of his own people,\u201d Key told Radio NZ late last month. Turnbull will leave New Zealand, his first overseas destination as prime minister, on Saturday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
