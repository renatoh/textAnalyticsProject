Brandon Flowers' 2010 solo album, Flamingo, revealed his current interest in classic Americana \u2013 air-punching, minor-key tunes and colourful refractions of a Vegas life, all neon lights and \"girls on the corner\", which Flowers, a Utah Mormon, may or may not have lived. It's a world away from the gruff, anglophile indie of Mr Brightside or the poetic pomposity of Human, which, love it or hate it, will be remembered for 100 years. With stagey soundscapes more Meat Loaf than Springsteen, and lines overloaded with postcard imagery (\"Your star-spangled heart took a train for the coast\"), you struggle to find the energy till the third or fourth listen, when Heart of a Girl (co-written with Daniel Lanois) and From Here on Out (which sounds just like the Eagles) reveal themselves to be the sweetest, most sincere explorations of a kind of US rock that will always raise hairs on the necks of those who like this sort of thing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
