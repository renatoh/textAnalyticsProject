The conference, hosted by the University of New South Wales in 2007, was entitled Cultures Across the Indigenous Health Spectrum: Achieving Better Outcomes. We were three academics from three different nations across the Pacific who began a conversation. This conversation sparked a connection. Martina, from the John A Burns School of Medicine, had just presented her work on Indigenous simulated patients as a method to teach medical students in Hawai\u2019i, which was a new initiative at the time. This involves using community members to act out a clinical interaction as a learning experience. Shaun, who had also presented on a similar initiative occurring at the University of Melbourne, approached Martina to interrogate her a little further about the details of her experience in implementing the program within the medical curriculum, to which she replied: \u201cI was going to ask you the same thing!\u201d Suzanne, the most practical of the three of us, piped up with an answer, sharing her experience of implementing their Indigenous simulated patient program at the Otago Medical School in Christchurch. We three realised in that moment that we had initiated similar programs in our own contexts. This connection grew into a collaboration and an ongoing exchange of critical conversations that have enhanced the work that we each do in our own place. We take very different approaches to our work, but this only enriches our engagement. We look forward to seeing what emerges each time we have the opportunity to meet and work together \u2013 at conferences, on sabbatical, or in research meetings. Since that day, we have visited one another\u2019s medical schools, co-authored papers and won international research grants together. A highlight of our collaboration has been our peer review initiative that involved participating in one another\u2019s innovative approaches to teaching Indigenous health to medical students. This has included attending curriculum programs located \u201con country\u201d that incorporate Indigenous knowledges and practices and provide exposure to traditional foods (e.g. poi), community Elders, traditional healers and practitioners. These exchanges enabled the sharing of learning methods, Indigenous curriculum frameworks and assessment methodologies that have provided a context for undertaking critical review and ongoing curriculum development in all of our work. We have a shared experience, and response to, the colonial project, but the diversity and difference of our place provides for some wonderful and sharp contrasts. The richness of this international collaboration in Indigenous health research, and teaching Indigenous health to health professionals in training, has added enormously to our working lives. Our paths cross again this week, 12 years on from that initial meeting, hosted this time by Suzanne and her team at the University of Otago Christchurch. The conference begins with a bus ride to \u014cnuku Marae, the journey narrated by Indigenous medical students sharing the significant local histories of the tribes to whom these lands belong. Proceedings begin with the formal karanga (ceremonial call) inviting Lime delegates on to \u014cnuku Marae, and the next hour is filled with deep oratory in the Indigenous languages of delegates from many nations. M\u0101ori, Cherokee, Yorta Yorta, Anishinaabe and Native Hawai\u2019ian languages are heard, each a signpost of Indigenous resilience to the forces of colonisation. No interpretation was needed, mutual respect was delivered, honoured and acknowledged. This year\u2019s conference theme is Pouhine Poutama: Embedding Indigenous Health Education, the concept building on the ideology of weaving. The weaving represents the art of bringing together horizontal and vertical strands to enhance and strengthen the work of all those who are a part of the Lime Network. It encourages the sharing of the innovative and challenging work being done in places so different, but toward a common goal. Between the three of us we are collectively 36 years older, our conversations have continued, our ideas developed, and the opportunities to build more formal networks between our organisations have come to fruition. Our work portfolios have been deeply enriched by our learning journeys together, but so have our personal lives. We have shared difficulties, successes and accolades. Our families know each other well, we are called \u201caunty\u201d or \u201cuncle\u201d by one another\u2019s children \u2013 we are family. Our tender words to each other when our families suffer loss, and joint celebrations of milestones achieved, continue to build these relationships. Lime was the genesis of this global wh\u0101nau (family/support network in te reo M\u0101ori). Today, the three of us sit within Indigenous health teaching teams. The capacity within our medical schools, and across the sector, has grown enormously. Our medical education journey is shared with others in pursuit of utilising Indigenous health teaching curriculum as a vehicle to addressing Indigenous health inequities and ensuring Indigenous rights are central to our universities\u2019 core business. We have each taken away key learnings from those who presented at the conference: that hard won gains can be easily lost unless there is eternal vigilance to continually push forward and reach for the best outcomes in Indigenous health, not just aspiring to \u201cclose the gap\u201d but to recognise that the strength of Indigenous knowledges and Indigenous ways of being enhance best practice in medicine and are crucial in establishing the best possible outcomes for all patients, not just for Indigenous peoples. The strength, determination and innovation of this new generation of Indigenous health professionals has left us feeling reinvigorated and confident that despite what obstacles the future may hold, we will continue to build upon our collective strengths, continue to raise the bar of what is possible, and help move our universities and hospitals into and beyond the realms of cultural safety through Indigenous leadership. \u2022 Professor Shaun Ewen is pro vice-chancellor (Indigenous) and foundation director of the Melbourne Poche Centre for Indigenous Health at the University of Melbourne \u2022 Associate professor Suzanne Pitama is director of the Maori Indigenous Health Institute, Christchurch, University of Otago \u2022 Associate professor Martina Kamaka is a medical educator in the Department of Native Hawai\u2018ian Health, at the John A.
