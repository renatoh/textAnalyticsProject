The Lib Dems were reduced from 56 MPs to a rump of just eight on a dreadful night that saw them routed in former strongholds in the south-west, and across large swaths of the rest of the country. Former cabinet ministers Vince Cable, Danny Alexander, David Laws and Ed Davey were all ousted from parliament as was former party president and London MP Simon Hughes. Ashdown, the former leader, masterminded the election strategy which promoted the party as a centre ground force that would give \u201cheart\u201d to the Tories and \u201cbrain\u201d to Labour in a potential coalition government. Baroness Hussein-Ece, a Lib Dem peer and adviser to Nick Clegg on community cohesion, backed calls from another former leader, David Steel, for the party to redefine itself as from the centre-left rather than one willing to prop up the Conservatives. On Friday, Steel, who has given his backing to Tim Farron as the next leader following Clegg\u2019s resignation, said that this strategy of splitting the difference between the two main parties had \u201cset back the progress of Liberalism for several decades\u201d. Hussein-Ece insisted that she did not regret the decision to join the Conservatives in coalition, but said that \u201cserious mistakes\u201d had been made in how the party portrayed itself. \u201cI think presenting ourselves as a coalition party rather than setting out our values and where we come from was a serious mistake,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should be the centre-left party that this country desperately needs.\u201d Ashdown played a cameo role on election night when he insisted that the 10pm exit poll putting the Lib Dems on 10 seats was wrong and said he would \u201ceat his hat\u201d if it turned out to be right. As it turned out the poll underestimated the drubbing the party would receive. Naomi Smith, chair of the Social Liberal Forum, a grouping of party members on the left of the party, said both Clegg and Ashdown had led the Lib Dems down a \u201ccentrist blind alley\u201d. \u201cIn 2010, Liberal Democrats were elected on a social liberal manifesto, in keeping with the party\u2019s traditional, left-of-centre, radical progressivism,\u201d she said.\u201dYet during the 2010 parliament, the leadership and their senior staff were, for the first time, able to control the party\u2019s direction. \u201cIn Thursday\u2019s election, voters delivered a verdict on this strategy. They overwhelmingly rejected it, dealing the Liberal cause its worst result since 1970. Liberals need to turn back from this centrist blind alley and find their soul again. The 2015 \u2018split the difference\u2019 strategy failed.\u201d Meanwhile, the Green party\u2019s only MP is proposing that progressive parties work together in future to beat Conservative candidates rather than splitting the votes in key seats. Caroline Lucas, who was re-elected for Brighton Pavilion, said she was backing the move after witnessing progressive politicians such as the Lib Dem MP Norman Baker, in neighbouring Lewes, being voted out. Baker lost by just over 1,000 votes to Tory candidate Maria Caulfield. The Green candidate, who stood little chance of victory, picked up 2,784 votes. Lucas said: \u201cThe system is wrong and we should have electoral reform, but that could be some time coming. So we need other ways to work together in a progressive alliance. Where it is appropriate, only one progressive candidate could stand in a seat \u2013 a sort of electoral pact. Cooperation during the EU referendum campaign could be the start of it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
