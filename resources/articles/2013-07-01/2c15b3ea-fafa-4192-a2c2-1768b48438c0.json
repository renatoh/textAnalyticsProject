The virtuosic German viola player brings irresistible variety to these four works for soloist and orchestra from the 1920s and 1930s, which include Der Schwanendreher, the sweetly meditative Trauermusik \u2013 written in haste in 1936 when Hindemith was in London at the time of the death of George V \u2013 and the six-movement Konzertmusik Op 48a in this world premiere recording of the first edition. Hindemith himself was a celebrated but unshowy viola soloist who left a huge catalogue of music for the instrument. Zimmermann plans to record it all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
