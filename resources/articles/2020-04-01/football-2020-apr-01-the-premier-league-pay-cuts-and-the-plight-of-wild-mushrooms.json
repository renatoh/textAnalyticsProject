Furious MP Julian Knight, chief suit of the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee, lambasted the nation\u2019s top 20 teams for operating in a \u201cmorel vacuum\u201d, perhaps believing that the industry had not been giving enough attention to edible fungi since the departure of Fifa\u2019s mushroom-loving if sadly fictional former head honcho, Cep Blatter. \u201cIt sticks in the throat,\u201d Knight said of the top flight\u2019s trompette-neglecting ways. \u201cThis exposes the crazy economics in English football and the morel vacuum at its centre.\u201d Knight\u2019s hackles had been raised by news that as the coronavirus crisis bites some clubs were continuing to pay their players in full while simultaneously making swingeing cuts to other areas of their budget, furloughing staff on normal-person wages and showing complete disregard for chanterelles. News of \u201csignificant, voluntary pay cuts\u201d reportedly accepted by Eddie Howe and other members of the leadership team at Bournemouth, whose approach might have been influenced by their proximity to the foraging hotbed that is the New Forest, has done little to assuage critics. One of the issues Premier League clubs have traditionally faced is a lack of either the funds or the inclination to even consider the plight of wild mushrooms, when they could spend \u00a3270,000 a week on Mesut \u00d6zil instead. However lucrative your global TV rights deal, when Max Meyer is taking home \u00a3130,000 a week there\u2019s not a lot left for forest-friendly fungus. \u201cFundamentally mushrooms are a bit of a luxury in our business,\u201d said one high-placed source The Fiver made up. \u201cObviously it\u2019s nice to have some, and there are times in life when they\u2019re almost indispensable, but our business is about success on the pitch and anything that doesn\u2019t help achieve it is irrelevant as far as I\u2019m concerned. We all stopped thinking about mushrooms back when Chelsea started paying Winston Bogarde \u00a340,000 a week and nothing\u2019s changed since.\u201d ***UPDATE: Due to an administrative error at Fiver Towers, Julian Knight\u2019s comments were misreported. He in fact accused the Premier League of operating in a \u201cmoral vacuum\u201d. Fortunately if you exchange mentions of mushrooms for morals the report remains fairly accurate, or as accurate as anything you\u2019re going to get from the Fiver. Apologies for any confusion*** QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cTo actually be in a little stadium playing against a team I didn\u2019t know, that was the real \u2018Sh!t, I\u2019m back, I\u2019ve made it\u2019 kind of thing. I think the last time I felt that good was when I was 15\u201d \u2013 Angus MacDonald gets his chat on with Ben Fisher about how happy he was to play again after having bowel cancer. RECOMMENDED LISTENING The latest Football Weekly podcast is right here. FIVER LETTERS \u201cIf Karim Benzema thinks Olivier Giroud is a \u2018go-kart\u2019, I\u2019d love to hear his assessment of St\u00e9phane Guivarc\u2019h. Who, incidentally, also has one more World Cup winners\u2019 medal than Benzema\u201d \u2013 Tim Woods (and plenty of others). \u201cThe whole issue between Benzema and Giroud comes down to this, with Giroud you get 75% of Didier Drogba, with Benzema you get 25% of Gary Lineker. You choose\u201d \u2013 Chas Tuchel. \u201cEd Bailey\u2019s and Steve Doorey\u2019s suggestions (Tuesday\u2019s Fiver) to complete the season via a five-a-side tournament or penalty shootouts are well-intentioned but unnecessarily complicated and involve far too much football. Why not determine the remaining matches of the season, at all levels, through a series of coin tosses? Companies with broadcasting and advertising rights could retain their privileges in the staging of events and the betting companies would be back in business. There would, of course, be some loss of gate revenue and income from the sale of cheese and other dairy products \u2013 but these losses could be offset by intercalating another entire season, based solely on coin tosses, between the end of this one and August. I reckon it could be the best chance we\u2019d have of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho leading Spurs to silverware\u201d \u2013 Tony Crooks. \u201cI enjoyed Patrick Wilkinson\u2019s recollection of his favourite game (Tuesday\u2019s letters) but surely, in the the spirit of The Fiver, readers should be encouraged to send in their recollections of their worst games. You know, the ones that involved them knacking themselves on the way back from a 0-0 draw at Firewall FC or something. It would be just the kind of schadenfreude Fiver readers need in these troubling times\u201d \u2013 George Jones. \u201cGiven that the accepted social distance measurement is two metres, then it is going to be hard to tackle, man-mark, or press should football ever go ahead again during this time of criss. Having said that, as a lifelong Coventry City fan, this won\u2019t be anything new for me to watch\u201d \u2013 Gerry Rickard. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS The former Marseille president Pape Diouf has died in Senegal after contracting coronavirus. Aston Villa goalkeeper Pepe Reina endured \u201cendless minutes of fear\u201d after contracting coronavirus symptoms. \u201cThe most difficult moment was when I could no longer breathe, the 25 minutes I ran out of oxygen,\u201d said Reina. \u201cIt was the worst moment of my life.\u201d There\u2019s going to be a Euro 2022! Meanwhile, Big Cup and Big Vase could be completed in August. Bayer Leverkusen players have joined Barcelona and Bayern Munich in accepting a pay cut to secure the jobs of non-playing staff. \u201cWe again got a very concrete idea in the empty BayArena stadium today about how important the various colleagues are in breathing life into the club and how important each and every one of them is in providing us with ideal conditions to do our job,\u201d said Leverkusen captain Lars Bender. Scary Northampton boss Keith Curle showed he\u2019s a big softy at heart after delighting a 73-year-old Cobblers fan with a cheery call to check in on her. \u201cI\u2019m so pleased you rung me,\u201d said Muriel, who sits in the East Stand at Sixfields. \u201cI heard the other day you were ringing people and I thought: \u2018He\u2019s forgotten me.\u2019\u201d And two weeks twiddling his thumbs at home is all it took for Kevin De Bruyne to decide he wants to extend his playing career for a good while longer than he intended to. \u201cI told my wife I\u2019m going to play a little longer. After this lockdown, I cannot stay at home. I told her I\u2019m going to take two years more,\u201d yelped the Belgian. STILL WANT MORE? Nicaraguan football is ploughing on through pandemic panic, to the delight of strongman president Daniel Ortega and chagrin of Liga Primera side Diriang\u00e9n: \u201cOur players are very afraid,\u201d general manager Sergio Salazar tells Nick Ames. Former wonderkid Sonny Pike parps merrily to Mr Ames about his journey from fast-riser to deep-faller, and finding happiness through working with tomorrow\u2019s wannabes.
