The figures, released by the Greyhound Board of Great Britain (GBGB), are part of a concerted push to improve welfare standards in the sport, but charities say it cannot be reformed due to the \u201cdangerously configured\u201d oval tracks that cause a majority of injuries and a failure to properly rehome the dogs after they have retired. Hundreds of dogs were \u201cput to sleep\u201d in 2018 for reasons including the high cost of medical treatment and the absence of a \u201cviable option away from the racecourse\u201d, while a suitable home could not be found for others. The GBGB recognised these were \u201cavoidable and unnecessary deaths\u201d and pledged to eradicate them from the sport. Nearly 250 greyhounds were euthanised at the racetrack on \u201chumane grounds\u201d last year, and scores died from \u201csudden death\u201d, along with another 190 put to death because they were \u201cunsuitable for homing\u201d. About a quarter were rehomed or retained by owners and trainers, and 60% were taken into the care of a greyhound charity, figures showed. Trudy Baker, coordinator of Greyt Exploitations, claimed hundreds of dogs remained in a commercial environment after their retirement and said that welfare commitments could not address the \u201csuffering and deaths of thousands of dogs\u201d. \u201cThe truth is hundreds of dogs listed as \u2018retired\u2019 by the GBGB still remain in a commercial environment, confined to trainers\u2019 kennels that have failed to comply with an agreed British Standard Institute specification, either used for breeding, forced to routinely donate blood or simply awaiting rehoming,\u201d she said. \u201cHundreds more are sold or given away again for breeding, to be raced abroad or on independent tracks, or used for research and dissection.\u201d She added: \u201cNo amount of ineffective \u2018window dressing\u2019 welfare commitments will address the suffering and deaths of thousands of dogs racing on dangerously configured tracks.\u201d Chris Luffingham, from the League Against Cruel Sports, said greyhound racing was inherently unsafe and highlighted how it was responsible for the deaths and injuries of thousands of dogs in the UK each year. \u201cThe greyhound industry continually fails to live up to its promises to truly put welfare first,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat these greyhounds really need is not yet more promises from the industry, but for the sport to be phased out and the greyhounds found good homes where they can live long and healthy lives.\u201d Mark Bird, GBGB managing director, said the industry was determined to \u201ceradicate all avoidable injuries and any unnecessary deaths\u201d. \u201cTo achieve this, however, requires not only the commitment of everyone in the sport but also the availability of adequate and sustained funding that allows welfare to flourish,\u201d he said. The animal welfare minister, David Rutley, said: \u201cTransparency is key to understanding how we can improve welfare standards ... We want more greyhounds to find new homes and to enjoy a healthy retirement when they leave the sport.\u201d There has been a steep decline in the number of greyhound tracks in recent years, with Wimbledon and the flagship course, Towcester, among those that closed as attendances reached historic lows."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
