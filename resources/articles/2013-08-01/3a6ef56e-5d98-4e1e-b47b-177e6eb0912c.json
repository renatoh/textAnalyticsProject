It's another new business.\" Tan views football ownership in those corporate terms, which partly explains why he refused to allow 100 years of tradition to influence his thinking when he made the hugely controversial decision to alter Cardiff's colours from blue to red last summer. This week he risked another storm when he returned to a familiar theme and refused to rule out changing the club's name. \"I always say 'never say never',\" Tan said on Thursday. \"But we are definitely not changing anything now.\" Cardiff have learned that they have to take the rough (rebranding) with the smooth (investment) when it comes to Tan. The disregard he showed for Cardiff's history will never be accepted by many of the supporters, but the other side of the coin is that the man who introduced McDonald's to Malaysia has saved the club from potential financial ruin, overseen promotion to the top flight for the first time in 51 years and delivered on his promise that, if the kit changed to red, the fans would see the colour of his money. It is estimated that Tan has injected upwards of \u00a370m in loans (which he has vowed to convert into equity) since buying Cardiff. He has settled a \u00a324m longstanding debt with Langston Corporation and sanctioned a \u00a328.7m splurge this summer that makes the Welsh club the Premier League's fourth-highest spenders. Cardiff have broken their transfer record three times in the space of 41 days, paying \u00a37.5m for the Danish striker Andreas Cornelius, \u00a38m to prise Steven Caulker from Tottenham Hotspur and \u00a311m for the Chile international Gary Medel. At least another two players are expected before the end of the window. \"The football club should be grateful over the last four years in terms of the way [the owner] has been because there aren't many people putting money into football clubs and not without an angle to take the money straight back out again,\" Malky Mackay, the Cardiff manager, said. \"Two years before I arrived, he put good money into this club to keep it afloat. He put money in last year and spoke about building a \u00a310m training ground. He's paid off the Langston debt, is adding seats to the stadium and allowed me funds to try and get promoted. Obviously, while we are here, we need to strengthen again.\" Tan tends not to interfere on the football side. He often pops into the dressing room before a match to wish the players good luck, which he will almost certainly do at West Ham United on Saturday, but there are no long speeches like the rambling one he delivered at last season's annual awards, when he was drowned out by Cardiff fans singing \"Bluebirds\". When it comes to the transfer deals Mackay and Iain Moody, the club's multilingual head of recruitment who handles all negotiations, are left to get on with things. Tan had a \u00a325m budget in place at the start of the summer but there was always some flexibility with that figure, with the owner happy to review players on a case-by-case basis. His approach is laid-back, rather than confrontational. While the Malaysian has always seen the potential monetary rewards to be made from getting a club into the Premier League, those that know believe his interest in football was heightened from the moment Cardiff reached the Carling Cup final in 2012, when they lost to Liverpool. The 60-year-old enjoyed the glamour that came with a day out at Wembley and decided he wanted more of the same. He tore up the three-year promotion plan that was in place when Mackay was appointed in 2011 and asked the Cardiff manager and his staff what it would take to reach the top flight within 12 months. Mackay pretty much got everything he asked for, including Craig Bellamy, the hometown hero. Cardiff were crowned champions the following April. This summer's recruitment drive has not been straightforward, even if Cardiff are pleased with the results. They targeted the French market but, although the finance was in place to cover the fees and wage demands, Cardiff struggled to convince players to join a newly-promoted club that had never been in the Premier League before. Etienne Capoue, who joined Spurs from Toulouse, and the Lyon striker Bafetimbi Gomis, were two who slipped through the net. In Britain, they missed out on Blackpool's Tom Ince and Victor Wanyama, who signed for Southampton from Celtic instead. Cardiff, though, were always juggling several balls in the air, going through lists of players that had been earmarked in the event of winning promotion. Caulker was one of them but Tottenham were looking for \u00a315m at the start of the summer and were more interested in trying to offload half a dozen bit-part players. Cardiff assumed the Caulker deal was dead but Spurs, out of the blue, slashed the asking price at the end of last month. The transfer was completed in 24 hours. It was as if Daniel Levy, the Spurs chairman, had another move on his mind. As for Medel, after monitoring the 26-year-old midfielder for nine months and haggling over the fee for weeks, the transfer was finally agreed during the half-time interval at Old Trafford last Friday, where Manchester United were playing Sevilla in Rio Ferdinand's testimonial. Mackay is particularly excited by Medel's arrival. \"In February Xavi came out and asked Barcelona to try and buy him, so that is pedigree,\" he said. If there is a downside to all this for Mackay, it is that Tan gives the impression \u2013 \"If you spend \u00a335m on a team, you expect your manager and the players to deliver\" \u2013 that he wants an immediate return on the investment. Not that Cardiff's manager seems fazed. \"He has expected results from last summer,\" Mackay admitted. \"His task for me was to be promoted. That's expectation, that's pressure, so I have had that already.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
