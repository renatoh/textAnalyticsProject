I have an interest only deal with Newcastle Building Society that costs around \u00a3220 a month. This is for an original loan of \u00a330,000, and the property is now worth around \u00a3150,000. I am 70 years of age with no dependants and would dearly love to be able to clear my debt and have some capital to spend on myself over the next few years. I have read several accounts of the various options available for raising money on my property, but have failed to find one that doesn't seem to have some hidden drawback. Could you suggest the best options for me to consider for further investigation. MM A The most straightforward way of clearing your \u00a330,000 mortgage and giving yourself some capital to play with would be to sell up and move to a cheaper property. But if this doesn't appeal and you want to stay put, some form of equity-release scheme would seem to be the answer. However, as you have pointed out no scheme is without its drawbacks. The main drawback of all equity-release schemes is they can affect entitlement to pension credit and other means-tested state benefits, but this will only be an issue if you are on a low income. If you are looking to raise a lump sum from your home rather than be paid a regular income, there are two types of scheme available. One is a lifetime mortgage where you borrow a lump sum against the value of your home. It's different from your current interest only mortgage in that interest on the loan is not payable monthly, it is added to the original loan and repaid only when the property is sold. But this can turn the loan into a seriously scary-looking amount of money. For example, if you took out a lifetime mortgage of \u00a345,000, and paid interest at 7%, the total owing to the lender would have risen to just over \u00a363,000 after five years and to \u00a388,500 after 10 years. But if you're unconcerned that there could be nothing left when your home is sold, whether that is after your death or a move to a care home, a lifetime mortgage could provide you with the money to clear your current deal and free up the \u00a3220 a month you pay in mortgage interest. The alternative is a home reversion scheme where you sell either all or a share of your house to a home reversion company, while retaining the right to live in it rent-free. The main drawback to these schemes is that you'll be paid a lot less for the share you sell than you would get by selling on the open market, perhaps only half the market value of the property. So in your case, the most you would be able to raise by selling a 100% share in your home could be \u00a375,000. But the company would get to keep the entire proceeds when the property is eventually sold.
