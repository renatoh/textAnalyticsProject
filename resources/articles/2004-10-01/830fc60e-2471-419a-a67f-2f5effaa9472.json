The 61-year-old United director Maurice Watkins's house and two cars were daubed with red paint on Monday night. However, the attack is believed by no means to be the haphazard work of angry individuals. Instead, it is thought this will be the first act of a sustained campaign to destabilise any attempted takeover of the stock-market-listed club. Acts of violence have not been ruled out. A spokesman for the Old Trafford club moved last night to calm the unease, saying: \"Manchester United condemns the acts of vandalism committed against one of its directors, Maurice Watkins, yesterday. The behaviour of a few individuals does nothing to enhance the reputation of the club they claim to support.\" Police sources would not rule out offering protection to United directors if the attacks turn to persons rather than property, but no decision will be taken until the investigation has run its course. United would not comment on whether they had stepped up their security arrangements. The motivation for the attack on Watkins, the largest single private investor in United with 1.9% of the club, is believed to have been that he sold 1m shares to Glazer this year, helping take the American's equity interest to 19.3%. With the Irish investors JP McManus and John Magnier also in possession of a 28.9% stake in United, via their Cubic Expression fund, Glazer needs only to persuade them to sell in order to tip his holding beyond the 30% required to facilitate a takeover. Though his assets are valued at \u00a3630m, Glazer does not have the means to cover a straight cash bid for the club, which would necessitate about \u00a3800m. The concern for fans is that he would load his investment with debt, which would require servicing from company profits, while delisting the club and drawing his own dividend. Activists are prepared to \"fight dirty\" in their attempt to prevent this eventuality. A group styling itself the Manchester Education Committee has already attacked the racing interests of McManus and Magnier after they entered into a legal dispute with the Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
