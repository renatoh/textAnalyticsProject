The philosopher was Pep Guardiola and the phrase explained much, even as it explained nothing at all. Ibrahimovic had arrived the previous summer on a deal officially valued at \u20ac69m and now he was gone. There was no explanation other than the fact that Guardiola didn't want him any more. Nor did there need to be. The previous summer Samuel Eto'o had been released to Internazionale as part of the Ibrahimovic deal. Guardiola said that it was a question of \"feeling\". He offered no other reason. It did not appear to be a question of football: Eto'o had been central to Barcelona's treble-winning side but it did not matter. He, too, was gone. Pretty much the first thing Guardiola had announced when he took over as Barcelona coach was that it would be better if Ronaldinho, Deco and Eto'o left. The former were pushed out immediately; Eto'o was gone a year later. There were reasons and many of them were an open secret \u2013 from a lack of professionalism to dressing-room confrontations and the coach's own tactical evolution \u2013 but there were never any explanations. There did not need to be: that was what Guardiola wanted, end of story. And if Barcelona were going to do things his way, they were going to do things his way. Xavi had played with Guardiola and he claims that he knew that Barcelona would be a success: \"Pep is a perfectionist. If he wanted to be a musician, he would be a great musician.\" For Guardiola things must be just right. When he arrived in the first team from Barcelona B, young and experienced, seemingly not in a position to make demands, he imposed upon Joan Laporta, the president who hired him, the need to employ his entire team: from his assistant Tito Vilanova to his own physio, scouts and physical trainers. That is not to say that he refused to listen to sporting directors \u2013 he reluctantly agreed to the sale of Dymtro Chygrinskiy \u2013 but beliefs and ideas must be shared. He has done things his way and his way is different. He is different. When he has made up his mind, it is unalterable. From the one-year rolling contracts at Barcelona, to the year's sabbatical. As a player he had spells in Mexico, Qatar and Italy. There has been a kind of moral hue to the path his career has travelled down, to the image he has projected of himself. It helped that Guardiola's way was Barcelona's way. \"We chose a philosophy not a brand,\" says Laporta. The day Guardiola arrived, he did not promise titles, but he did promise that Barcelona would be \"faithful to our philosophy, to a way of understanding the game\". He was true to his word. \"His success was making us believe in his ideas. More that training us, he taught us,\" says Andr\u00e9s Iniesta. That philosophy was Cruyff's. \"Pep suckled from the teat of Cruyff,\" says one of his collaborators. Few sides have had an identity so clear, so rigid, so immediately apparent. So different. But is that philosophy applicable elsewhere? Does his philosophy fit? Does he fit? The former Barcelona coach has hung over recent events at Chelsea. He has said nothing and he has stayed away, thousands of miles away, but his presence has been felt. On Sunday Chelsea play Manchester City. His presence has been felt at the Etihad too. It is hard to read mere coincidence into the arrival in Manchester of Ferran Soriano and Txiki Beguiristain. It feels like a prelude, an attempt to convince Guardiola that he fits. They can join the queue. Roman Abramovich is one of many who aspires to Guardiola. It is safe to assume that he believes he has a chance. Everyone, he probably figures, has his price. Everyone can be persuaded. Otherwise, why would he choose another interim manager? Why would he bring in Rafa Ben\u00edtez on a seven-month deal? Why would he be so determined that the job be available when Guardiola becomes available? But not all his actions seem conducive to convincing the Catalan. On the most simplistic level: seven months of Ben\u00edtez does not feel like a natural transition towards Guardiola. Guardiola gave no explanations while Barcelona manager, not publicly at least. This week it emerged that Roberto Di Matteo was forced to give explanations after every game; he also felt obliged to play certain players. Guardiola would not accept such interference. He was not for turning when Barcelona did not win their opening two games under him, nor when Eto'o scored the opening goal in the European Cup final. When he decided Ibrahimovic's time was up he was implacable. Guardiola holds the cards now in a way that he never did in 2009 and his position is strong. He is unlikely to face the same obligations that Di Matteo did. Or have a \u00a350m player turn up unrequested, as happened to Ancelotti. He may be told that Hazard, Mata and Oscar were signed with him in mind and he would no doubt get promises and guarantees denied to others. But watching events unfold at Stanford Bridge, he is entitled to wonder whether he really fits there. Style and substance both matter; neither fully fit. The ground is being prepared but will Guardiola like the lie of the land?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
