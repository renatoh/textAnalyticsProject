So, with domestic Six Nations tickets as hard to come by as ever, why not visit Rome, where Italy host Ireland, Wales and France (5, 26 February, 12 March). Stadio Flaminio is a short tram ride from the centre, and is an ageing but cosy, low-slung venue built in the 1950s and surrounded by the 1960 Olympic village \u2013 a world away from modern mega-stadiums. Rome often basks in sunshine at this time of year and the Italian crowd are as emotional and enthusiastic as any. As they are always the underdogs, the games have a relaxed and convivial feel that you won't find elsewhere in the Six Nations. And, of course, it's impossible not to be moved by the joy a victory can bring to the competition's newest contestants. The cheapest match tickets are \u20ac35 (\u00a330) \u2013 even less if you go with a crowd and buy 13 or more. For that (and you can buy the tickets across all home fixtures) there is a 10% reduction provided you buy by 10 Jan, (ticket.federugby.it, +39 02 600 60 900). Easyjet and Ryanair still have cheap flights to Rome around these dates. Observer Sport's cultural attache recommends a pre-match lunch at the quiet, homely La Greppia restaurant, five minutes walk from the stadium on Viale Tiziano. Enjoy a gelato by the Tiber afterwards and finish off at the Teatro dell'Opera, where tickets for Verdi's masterpiece Nabucco are available on the night of the France game. Golf Royal St George's at Sandwich in Kent plays host to The Open (14-17 July) and it's a fine venue for seasoned fans and anyone contemplating a first visit to the tournament. It is well worth going. Golf is one of the few sports where you can be up close to the biggest stars. There is very little obtrusive security (bar the inevitable bobby following discreetly behind Tiger) and both players and fans follow an unspoken etiquette that allows a rare degree of proximity. It is exhilarating to see, from a few feet away, players make shots that look easy on TV but far more testing in real life. St George's is a particularly good course to enjoy the experience. The undulations of the links, and the many hillocks make for natural amphitheatres on many of the holes. There are excellent vantage points for big crowds while, as a golfing test for the players, it is immense, with punishing, deep, rough, and the sea breeze threatening to change conditions throughout. A ticket for the full week (opengolf.com) is a reasonable \u00a3220 with competition days at \u00a355 each. Sandwich station is 15-minutes walk away, there's a park and ride for drivers and plenty of places to stay. Nearby Margate offers a dilapidated charm: many affordable hotels, friendly locals and crazy golf on the seafron t. NIck Faldo (left) always attracts a crowd at the Open and organisers will be hoping he also attends the Senior Open at Walton Heath. (21-24 July). The Surrey course (near Epsom) hosted the 1981 Ryder Cup, which the US won 18\u00bd to 9\u00bd, and 13 of those who played then are still on the Seniors circuit. The tournament might feature the likes of Faldo, Bernhard Langer , Sam Torrance and Sandy Lyle. A ticket for four days is good value at \u00a360 (europeantour.com). If you can't make it to Sandwich, this is a good alternative. If a holiday is in the offing, there's the World Matchplay Championship (19-22 May) at the Finca Cortesin golf club in Andalucia (fincacortesin.com), a beautiful venue on the coast between Marbella and Sotogrande. Football This year's Champions League final (28 May) is at Wembley and tickets, always nearly impossible to come by, will be at a premium regardless of whether any English clubs reach the final. And they won't be cheap: last year in Madrid the average face value was more than \u00a3100. The ballot opens in March at Uefa.com. Good luck. The Europa League final (18 May) in Dublin is a more realistic target. The first stage ballot is open until 13 Jan and tickets start at \u00a344 (www.fai.ie). It's limited to two per person and open only to residents of the Republic so City, Liverpool and Rangers fans may see this as an opportune moment to reacquaint themselves with friends and relatives across the water. Sales beyond Ireland open on 21 Feb. Or, if you fancy an exotic short break in the same competition, how about the Belgian-Dutch face-off of Anderlecht v Ajax (17 Feb) or the return a week later? The Low Countries derbies are special and are just under two hours away by train. Athletics and Olympics This year's World Championships take place in South Korea (27 August - 4 September) but one of the prime spots to watch Britain's potential Olympians for 2012 in action is at the European Indoor Championships in Paris (4-6 March). Jessica Ennis (below) and Phillips Idowu will be looking to add indoor titles to their tally and the excitement generated in these enclosed spaces is infectious. Good value too, starting at \u20ac75 (\u00a364) for the full three days (paris-2011.com). At home the stand-out meets are the Diamond League events at Birmingham (10 July) and Crystal Palace (5/6 August). The latter is always a sell-out and has the edge for atmosphere but Birmingham offers the newly redeveloped Alexander stadium and will be home to training camps for the US and Jamaican teams in 2012, so may also feature star names. If either whets the appetite for the Diamond League, finish off with the final meet in Brussels (16 September) . It draws a hugely energetic crowd, is only one hour 51 minutes from London on the Eurostar, tickets start at \u20ac25 and, of course, it includes the presentation of the winners diamonds. The likely Olympic triathlon route will be on full view at the London round of the ITU World Championship (6-7 August, london.triathlon.org). Hyde Park and the Serpentine form part of the course and it's a great chance to take a look at medal hopefuls Alistair Brownlee, his younger brother Jonathan and Tim Don. Take a sneak peak at how another Olympic venue may look in the form of the Badminton World Championships (8-14 August) at Wembley Arena, which hosts the event in 2012. Olympic tickets go on sale in March, so sign up for the latest news at london2012.com, which will also ensure you are sent regular reminders of what to watch this year ahead of the Games. Cricket There's a potential post-Ashes celebration at the ICC World Cup (19 February - 2 April). The tournament is being held in India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, so if you fancy a trip to Asia there are tickets for England's games with Holland, Ireland and, more enticingly, South Africa and the West Indies still available, all of which are being played in India. The first chance to see Andrew Stauss (right) and England's Ashes-retaining squad at home will be at the first Test against Sri Lanka at Cardiff (26-30 May, glamorgancricket.com). Also interesting is Hampshire's debut as a Test venue at the Rose Bowl for the third Test (16-20 June, rosebowlplc.com). A greatly improved venue, the Rose Bowl is offering five-day passes for the price of three days . The Lord's Tests against Sri Lanka and India are sold out but returned tickets will be available on 10 January (lords.org). However, the matches with India at The Oval, Trent Bridge and Edgbaston have spaces on all days (except The Oval on the Saturday). Motor Racing Silverstone hosts the British Grand Prix (10 July) boasting a brand new pit lane and paddock. The changes mean that the first corner is now Abbey, where seats have a price tag of \u00a3299 for the weekend (silverstone.co.uk). General entry is \u00a3149 for the three days and it is worth going to all of them. You won't be alone: 80,000 attended Friday practice last year. Prime viewing can be found at Copse, where the cars hit the right-hander aiming to take advantage through Maggots. If you're making a weekend of it there are good camping facilities at the circuit or nearby at Whittlebury Park (whittlebury.com), while sticking around at the track on Sunday night is rewarded with a free concert, driver appearances and a big party. Cracking stuff. Alternatively, give the Belgian GP at Spa a try (28 Aug). With a following wind you can be at Europe's finest circuit in two and a half hours from Calais (just don't hit the Brussels ring road during rush hour) and weekend general entry tickets are on offer at \u00a3124 until the end of this month. (spagrandprix.com). There's plentiful camping (francorchamps-parking.com) within walking distance, while if you rent a Kanagroo portable TV (kangaroo.tv) there's no need to join the crush in front of the big screens. It features Five Live commentary too. Suitably armed, there are plenty of good spots easily found, on the Kemmel Straight for example. It's also worth sticking around. Fans are allowed on the track to walk its full undulating distance, so march up Eau Rouge and appreciate why this is a circuit like no other. Finish with some Ardennes sausage and take the waters at Spa's Les Thermes, with its gorgeous outdoor pool overlooking the town. Racing As always the the Cheltenham Festival (15-18 March) is the big one and if you feel hearty enough to make all four days (a task not to be taken lightly), tickets in advance offer a slight discount at cheltenham.co.uk. Or there's the first British Champions' Day (15 October) at Ascot. Every race will be a final of the Champions Series, staged over the year at 10 courses and comprising 35 races. It's designed to provide a climax to the flat season and to encourage new spectators to follow the sport as part of the Racing For Change scheme. There is \u00a33m in prize money on offer, details at ascot.co.uk. First timers might also like to visit a midweek evening meeting at Sandown (sandown.co.uk). The course is particularly user-friendly with the entire circuit viewable from the stands. There are helpful signs explaining racing jargon dotted about, a friendly, welcoming atmosphere and the railway station is next to the course."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
