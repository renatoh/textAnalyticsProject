Its scheme, Project Hero, is looking to invest in the development of footballers and \"would look to sell to interested clubs and keep a significant share in the player by way of a percentage of the sell-on fee\". That manifesto has attracted the attention of the very similarly named Hero Global Football Fund, which has been attempting to establish itself on very similar terms. Working behind the Hero fund is the former Liverpool captain Alan Hansen. Working behind Project Hero is the former Liverpool captain Steve McMahon. Some of Project Hero's other financial backers do not have an enviable business record. In 2007 three of the directors of Profitable Group \u2013 Tim Goldring, Nigel Blanchard and Neil Osborn \u2013 were behind the Profitable Plot Company that was the subject of a winding-up petition from the Department of Trade and Industry which was avoided when the company went into voluntary liquidation. One of the Profitable Group's core businesses in Singapore is Profitable Plots, which purchases UK land and sells shares in it on the promise of enhanced value once planning permission is achieved. After repeated planning-application failures the validity of the scheme has been questioned, upsetting investors in Asia and Canada. Its Canadian client-services manager, Dan Strumos, insists there is nothing untoward since, he says, the Singapore government puts to death anyone guilty of \"corporate shenanigans\" (although Nick Leeson seems to have survived). Meanwhile, the Hero Global Football Fund is consulting lawyers over Profitable's Project Hero plans. Shearer set for the settee Alan Shearer's chances of being reinstated as Newcastle United manager are slim enough for the BBC to expect him to be sitting in its studio rather than in the dugout for the opening game of its Football League coverage. The BBC will keep his seat on the pundits' settee open for as long as he needs to clarify his position with Newcastle. But no one at the corporation expects that to be before his old team head to West Bromwich Albion on 8 August for the first match of the three-year BBC deal. Parry not hurried There are already rumblings of discontent about the government's sports-betting integrity panel, which is a month old but has yet to hold a formal meeting. Rick Parry, the chair, is sensibly holding individual, private meetings with all 13 representatives from sport and the betting industry who make up the panel, in an effort to discover some common ground as a starting point for discussions. But due to panellists' holiday commitments, formal talks will not take place until the end of August at the earliest \u2013 two months after the launch of the process. The expectation of the sports minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, that the diametric opposites on the panel can be reconciled enough to come up with \"a clear set of recommendations\" within six months, is looking ever more unrealistic but the government was still sticking to its timetable yesterday. Lloyd mystifies LTA David Lloyd delivered a withering broadside for the Lawn Tennis Association this week as he announced he \"cannot stay in tennis in Britain\", which would mean him ending his association with his three academies in Scotland and the south east. The comments raised eyebrows at the LTA, not because it was accused of being \"a disgrace\" but because it thought it was withdrawing its funding from Lloyd's academies, not the other way round. Simmons faces exit There could be blood on the carpet when the England and Wales Cricket Board's 15-man cricket committee meets today. Moves have been afoot for some time to unseat Jack Simmons, the chairman, and unless the former Lancashire all-rounder can mount a strong defence, his 18-month stint as one of the game's most influential powerbrokers will be over."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
