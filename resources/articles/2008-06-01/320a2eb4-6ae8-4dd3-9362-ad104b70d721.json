That said, you can make it on the spot and still end up with a very satisfying result. Just make sure you chill it before serving. Serves four. 1 large green pepper, cored and roughly chopped 4 celery sticks, roughly chopped 180g cucumber, peeled, roughly chopped 140g cooked potato, cold 350g Greek yogurt 200ml cold vegetable stock 180ml olive oil, plus extra to drizzle 25g parsley, leaves and stalk 25g dill, leaves and stalk, plus extra to garnish 3 garlic cloves, crushed Grated zest of 1 lemon \u00bd tsp salt Freshly ground black pepper 2 tbsp lemon juice Lots of fresh basil and mint, leaves picked, to serve For the tapenade toasts 80g pitted black olives 20g capers 1 garlic clove 1 sprig fresh thyme, leaves picked 1 tbsp olive oil 4 slices rustic white bread Put all the soup ingredients, except the lemon juice, basil and mint, into a large bowl. Stir roughly with a wooden spoon or, even better, squash together with your hands, then cover the bowl and refrigerate for 24 hours. To make the tapenade toasts, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/ gas mark 6. In a food processor, work the olives, capers, garlic, thyme and oil to a rough paste, then brush this mixture over the bread slices and lay out on an oven tray. Bake for eight to 10 minutes - the toasts should be crisp on the outside but not totally dry - then remove from the oven and set aside to cool down. When you are ready to serve, remove the bowl from the fridge and blitz the soup with a stick blender (or in a food processor) until smooth. Taste, adjust the seasoning as necessary and stir in the lemon juice. Divide the soup into individual bowls, garnish with a generous amount of freshly shredded basil and mint, and the extra fresh dill. Drizzle over a little more oil and serve each bowl with a tapenade toast. \u00b7 Yotam Ottolenghi is chef/patron of Ottolenghi in London."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
