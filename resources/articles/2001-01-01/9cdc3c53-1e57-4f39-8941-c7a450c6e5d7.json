Perhaps it is the memory of the country's most famous player, Jean van de Velde, making a complete mess of the final hole at the 1999 Open Championship, but the seasoned golfer planning a weekend away is more likely to plump for the Algarve, southern Spain, or even the alligator-infested swamps of Florida. Perhaps it is time to think again. The sport has been steadily growing in popularity across the Channel, and nowhere more so than in the Loire Valley with its meandering rivers, lush vineyards, royal chateaux, picturesque villages, and, most importantly for the golfer, its ancient forests that developers have crafted (others might say crucified) to produce courses that would be the envy of most British golf clubs. On a four-day golfing break, my father and I made our first stop at the imposing 17th-century Ch\u00e2teau des Sept Tours, set deep in the Loire countryside (never has a bathroom afforded a more spectacular view of the 18th hole). After a refreshing dinner (\u00a325 excluding wine), we decided in a fit of bravado to enter the stroke-play competition the following day only to find ourselves paired with the three-time club champion, a Swedish woman in her mid-50s. After a perfunctory introduction, during which she informed us that she used to play with Laura Davies, my father hooked his ball off the first tee into the small stream on the right, while I duffed my first shot short of the ladies' tee, the second went three yards, and the third went high and wide down the right. Not an auspicious start. Our playing partner fired her first one down the mid dle, and her second on to the green, from where she took two putts for par. The round continued in roughly the same manner, regularly interspersed with her shouting obscenities at the group behind whenever they raised their voices above a whisper. The course itself (\u00a320 a round) is adequate, and there are some testing holes, particularly the absurdly long 9th, but both aesthetically and as a challenge it did not come close to the next stop on our mini-tour, Baug\u00e9-Pontigne (\u00a320 a round). An old chapel stands beside the first tee (\"It is always a good idea to pray before golf,\" said course manager) and the ramshackle farm buildings that make up the clubhouse are a joy. Remember to order lunch before you play - ridiculously cheap at \u00a38 for four courses. But for all Baug\u00e9's charm, from a purely golfing point of view the highlight of the weekend was Les Bordes (\u00a350 a round), which was formerly the personal golf course of Baron Bich of ballpoint-pen fame. The facilities are second to none, from the practice ground to the majestic timbered clubhouse, with its excellent restaurant (lunch \u00a312) and bar. The baron fell in love with the game at the age of 68, inspired partly by his Japanese business partner, and set out to create a course to compete with the best that Europe and America could offer. He brought in a course designer from Houston, Texas, who turned some of the baron's prime hunting land into 18 of the most terrifying but enjoyable holes imaginable. There are narrow fairways, generously populated with bunkers, and millions of gallons of water that invariably swallow up anything except the sweetest and straightest shots. However many golf balls you usually carry in your bag, double it when you play at Les Bordes. And then triple it. And that may still not be enough. The 14th hole summarises everything you need to know about Les Bordes. A frighteningly-long par 5, the drive requires a long carry across the water, while the perfect landing area for the second shot is narrow and lined with bunkers. But just when you think you've navigated the hard part, there is the green to contend with: a tiny peninsula in the middle of a lake is not much of a target to aim for from 160 yards. Much to my surprise, I managed to find the green in three. But in my excitement, I hit the first putt too hard, the second too soft, while the third lipped out. Typical.
