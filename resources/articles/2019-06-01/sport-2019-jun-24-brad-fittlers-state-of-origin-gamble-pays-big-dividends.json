The Blues coach rang in the changes after a horror series opener, making seven in what was widely seen as panicky and desperate. Yet come full-time at a rain-sodden Optus Stadium in the rugby league outpost at Perth, Fittler was hailed as a genius. NSW ran out 38-6 winners in what was a rout from beginning to end. It was a devastating show of speed, strength and skill that never allowed the Maroons into the match. Tom Trbojevic spent most of his time inside Queensland\u2019s in-goal, held up in the fourth minute before scoring the opener in the 10th on the back of a lovely set play. It was the first of three as he became just the fourth player in New South Wales history to score an Origin hat-trick. It was very much the new brigade that shone the brightest for the Blues. Trbojevic\u2019s hat-trick was sublime. Bulldog half James Maloney just wins everywhere he goes and was instrumental with his kicking game and deft touch. Daniel Saifiti is a no-frills player but his barnstorming, line-bending run laid the platform for Tyson Frizell\u2019s try that put the Blues up 12-6. Wade Graham has hardly played any football all season and spent most of the game playing in his unaccustomed position of five-eighth but was outstanding, having a hand in two second-half tries. Dale Finucane was elevated to the starting lock forward job and could not have done anymore. Tariq Sims played an effective cameo. Jack Wighton and Blake Ferguson both overcame early errors. To win with so many new faces on a short turnaround was a remarkable coaching effort. Fittler took a hammering in the media with everyone up to Phil Gould stunned at the axe the Blues coach wielded. He essentially gambled his Origin career. He won and the Blues now sit heavily favoured to pull off an unlikely series comeback. Most pleasing for the NSW boss would have been the impenetrable defence. The Blues were relentless in their line speed and contact all night and the Maroons got their only points from a controversial penalty try when lead referee Gerard Sutton adjudicated Will Chambers would have scored had he not been run off the ball. The Bunker concurred but the Blues line was not breached then and would not be at any point over the course of 80 minutes. While Fittler could not have been happier with the performance of New South Wales, the news was not all great with halfback Nathan Cleary failing to make it out of the sheds after halftime. An ankle injury that first reports suggest is serious have him in doubt for the decider. If he is unable to go, Fittler will be scratching for options with Adam Reynolds and Luke Keary both out injured, Mitchell Pearce clearly having little interest in a recall after some suspect injuries kept him out of consideration for the first two games and Cody Walker perhaps scarred from his treatment in the opener. The pressure now sits squarely on the shoulders of Queensland coach Kevin Walters. He will be under pressure to swing the axe like his NSW counterpart. The cupboard in Queensland is more than a little thin though and the most likely scenario is that Walters will attempt to leverage the embarrassment of the humiliating Perth loss to lift his troops. The back three got smashed in metreage and that is an area the Maroons desperately need to get right. Kalyn Ponga had his most forgettable game while Dane Gagai and Corey Oates provided very little carting the ball out of trouble. All are likely safe. The same cannot be said of forwards Dylan Napa and Jarrod Wallace, who both had poor outings. The one ace Walters does have up his sleeve is the phone number of Cameron Smith. Origin lore has been written on the heroic and unexpected comebacks of Alan Langer, Andrew Johns and Fittler himself. A Smith return for one game only with the series on the line and the Maroons mammoth underdogs would truly be the stuff of legend. There have been plenty of indicators this year too that a comeback could be in the offing. It would be a desperate move from Walters. But as Brad Fittler proved, from desperation can come glory."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
