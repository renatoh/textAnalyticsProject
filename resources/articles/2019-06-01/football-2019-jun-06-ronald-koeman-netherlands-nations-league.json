At the time, he had just been installed as his national team\u2019s manager after an unsatisfying stint at Everton. His main task was to bring back the old days after the country missed out on the previous two major tournaments. On the evidence of his first game \u2013 a 1-0 home defeat by England \u2013 glory was not about to return any time soon. The verdict in the Guardian made for uncomfortable reading for Oranje fans who had seen their side beaten by England on home soil for the first time since 1969. \u201cWe saw here why this is regarded as the worst Dutch side for a long time,\u201d Daniel Taylor wrote, adding that \u201ca win against this lot cannot be considered the prize it once was\u201d. Things now look very different. Victory for Gareth Southgate\u2019s side on Thursday could be considered very much a prize and not only because it would deliver a place in the Nations League final. In a short time the Netherlands have rediscovered their mojo. The former internationals Ronald de Boer and Pierre van Hooijdonk see a variety of factors behind the resurgence and agree the development of the squad has been the most important. \u201cIn several key positions certain players have made huge steps in the last year,\u201d says De Boer, who won 67 Netherlands caps. \u201cFrenkie de Jong continued to improve at Ajax, Matthijs de Ligt became even more mature, Memphis Depay starred for Lyon and Virgil van Dijk and Georginio Wijnaldum further developed at Liverpool.\u201d Van Hooijdonk, who got 46 caps, singles out two high performers. \u201cWhen Frenkie de Jong made his debut earlier this season the team started to play better football. They were able to base their game on possession again. It\u2019s refreshing to see how he can accelerate the speed of the game. His presence also has a positive impact on other players \u2013 you can see it with Wijnaldum, for instance, who is now able to play in a more attacking role.\u201d The former Celtic and Nottingham Forest striker also points to Depay\u2019s creative spark. \u201cKoeman has given him a lot of responsibility with a free role in his starting XI. Against Germany he was perhaps too much out of his position as a striker but after the game Koeman said: \u2018That\u2019s how Memphis plays.\u2019 Koeman has offered him the possibility to grow into this role and Depay has responded really well.\u201d It has been a good year for Dutch football all round. Apart from the Netherlands qualifying for the Nations League finals, Ajax reached the Champions League semi-finals. That has benefited the national team, according to De Boer. Ajax played their quarter- and semi-finals after the most recent international break but beating Dynamo Kyiv in qualifying, drawing twice with Bayern Munich in the group and then defeating Real Madrid had a positive impact, he says. \u201cSome players gained a lot of confidence and they took that with them to the Dutch squad. The European games of Ajax, and also those of PSV [who faced Barcelona, Internazionale and Tottenham in their Champions League group], have been really valuable in terms of experience.\u201d Van Hooijdonk agrees: \u201cPlayers like De Ligt and De Jong have proved they can perform at the same level as they have done for Ajax. That is very impressive at their age. Donny van de Beek also had a very strong season and is knocking on Koeman\u2019s door.\u201d Koeman\u2019s impact needs to be recognised as well. \u201cI think the players are mainly responsible, but Koeman plays a very important part too,\u201d De Boer says. \u201cHe has struck the right chord with his players. He has kids himself of the same age as many of the players \u2013 which helps him understand them \u2013 but at the same time he has a certain authority as a coach.\u201d An important factor in the growing togetherness was the Dutch Football Association\u2019s decision to move the team\u2019s training camp to its own headquarters in Zeist, a switch similar to when the English FA opened St George\u2019s Park in 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s an advantage now all the facilities are centred in one place,\u201d De Boer says. \u201cBefore they had to take a bus from hotel to training ground; now everything is in close reach, like pitches and gym.\u201d Van Hooijdonk notes that the relocation coincided with a new approach within the national setup: \u201cIt was back to basics and they started to build again. Agreements were made and Koeman created clarity. Since then, there has not been a single incident. There is a really good atmosphere in the squad \u2013 all the players really want to be and stay there. In a short amount of time the national team has grown much closer to the nation again.\u201d Since that defeat by England, the Netherlands have recorded impressive results, especially in the Nations League, in which they topped a group that also included Germany and France. Van Hooijdonk admits there has been an element of luck and that there remains a missing link. \u201cThere is still no creative player in the team such as Rafael van der Vaart or Robin van Persie,\u201d he says. Perhaps that player can be found in the next generation. According to De Boer there are exciting youngsters coming through. \u201cThe Ajax under-17 team is really exceptional. You saw that when Holland Under-17s won the Euros recently. That was even without two star players, Ryan Gravenberch and Mohammed Ihattaren. It\u2019s a matter of generations. Sometimes a good generation ends and you have to wait for the next one to step up.\u201d De Boer reckons the Netherlands may peak in three years. \u201cEveryone is at a very good age by then. So perhaps we can achieve something at the 2022 World Cup.\u201d It is a bold ambition \u2013 shared by England \u2013 and not one anyone could have imagined a year ago."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
