The winger is yet to work for the same manager over the course of an entire season. \"Hopefully I am not putting the mockers on Martin O'Neill,\" he said. Milner had turned out for a couple of Premier League matches with Newcastle United in August 2008 before the \u00a312m move to Villa was completed. \"I am enjoying my football now,\" he said. \"Hopefully this could be the first season I start and finish with the same manager. That would be nice. I am not making excuses but that hasn't helped.\" Milner has been a victim of the sport's instability. The 23-year-old has served under 13 managers and caretaker managers. It is not the sort of variety that is helpful to a footballer and although he is too tactful to admit it, he must have been disappointed to be stuck in the England under-21 squad for so long that he set the record for his country with 46 appearances at that level. At least his promotion to the full national team was worth the wait. He was introduced with 23 minutes left in last month's friendly with Holland and set up Jermain Defoe's equaliser in the 2-2 draw while playing incisively on the left. The winger had shown instantly that he has much more to offer than patience. \"I was just desperate to get out there,\" said Milner. \"I just wanted to make an impact. I had waited a while so I was more than ready to make that debut. It's a very competitive England midfield but that is what we want. The manager wants competition for places and the players are doing the right thing to make life tougher for him. And we've got good young players coming through.\" If the manager, Fabio Capello, is persuaded that a winger with a craving to make up for lost time can be a game-changer, there may be work ahead in Saturday's friendly with Slovenia or next Wednesday's key World Cup qualifier against Croatia. It must have been disruptive to be caught up in the uncertainties that engulfed Leeds United and Newcastle, but Milner had an initial impact. He broke Wayne Rooney's record as the youngest scorer in the history of the Premier League when he notched the equaliser for Leeds in a 2-1 win over Sunderland in December 2002, although Everton's James Vaughan has since outdone them both. \"It put me on the map,\" said Milner, \"but then you have to learn to deal with it. Wayne progressed very quickly at a similar age. In a way, he took a lot of limelight off me, which helped massively. If that had not happened, I would probably have had more attention than I had. I am very grateful to him. When you look at how well he dealt with it, it just shows what a strong character he is and what a player.\" The tone of Milner's remarks shows him to be a footballer with misgivings about being in the public eye and there are occasions when he seems happiest to contribute in an unobtrusive manner. He can sound as if he wants to take command and then, in the next breath, as if he would rather be seen as one among many. \"You want as much of that limelight as you can because you are putting in good performances,\" Milner said. \"I just keep myself to myself and prepare the best way possible to go out on a Saturday and do as well as I can.\" His experiences since his time as a youngster have prevented him from being romantic about professional football. \"It is important you learn from these experiences,\" Milner said. \"There always seemed to be something going on at Leeds and Newcastle. \"I was well looked after by the senior players at Leeds and I needed that. It is important, the tough times you go through. Getting relegated with Leeds was probably my lowest point. It is not just going through [the tough times], it was what you take from them. You have to learn.\" He does appear to have found a stability at Villa that might let him fulfil his potential. \"You work so hard on the training field every day,\" said Milner, \"and in the gym afterwards, doing whatever to get to the top. \"To get on [for England] was great but hopefully that is just the start of a new chapter. I have played 20 minutes. I have got one cap. That is great. But the next thing I have to do is prove I should be in this squad every time and prove I should be in the team.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
