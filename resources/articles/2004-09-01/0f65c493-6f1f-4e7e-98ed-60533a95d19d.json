BBC2 Parkinson ITV1 Friday Night with Jonathan Ross BBC1 If I had ever wondered wherein lay my own personal Paula Radcliffe - i.e. the point where I couldn't go on watching the television even though every fibre of my being was telling me I should - then I found out the Friday before last, at the top of the news, as a man carried the limp and bloodied body of a dead child from the smouldering shell of the Beslan school, at which point I got up and walked out of the room. After a couple of decades spent sating an unquenchable thirst for news, for the first time I'd hit the wall. I tuned, warily, into the BBC's 10 O'Clock News last Tuesday and noticed that the reliably chipper Huw Edwards looked a bit weary as he prepared viewers, already reeling from BBC1's Whistleblower, for perhaps the most horrific piece of footage I have ever seen: the Beslan hostage-takers' video from inside the school, which I viewed through my fingers, head-in-hands, shaking in disbelief. It does a soul no good to see images of such extraordinary cruelty, to know that so many of those terrified seminaked children, parents, teachers and carers huddled around the tripwired explosives guarded by hooded captors, were waiting to die and, as a result, I cannot be alone in having felt depressed and nervily on-edge all week. I even started wondering whether it was sensible to board the flights my family and I were booked to take on 11 September. Every synapse of my brain screamed: 'Don't be so bloody stupid!' Every sinew of my heart told me that this irrational, low-level, nonspecific, batten-down-thehatches kind of niggling fear is now as virulently contagious and incurable as the common cold. Perhaps, then, the third anniversary of 11 September might have been better marked with less in the way of alarmist documentaries (C4's The 9/11 Conspiracies), dramatised terrorthons (BBC2's The Grid) and undercover reporting with hidden cameras (the aforementioned Whistleblower, a depressing but somehow entirely unsurprising investigation into non-existent security at Manchester airport) and more in the way of... oh, I don't know, wildlife docs, comedies or just plain old-fashioned fun dramas, such as Sunday night's excellent ITV1 offering, Quite Ugly One Morning, which starred Jimmy Nesbitt as a dishevelled journalist who looked not unlike the way I was feeling. Once upon a fading memory, the grimmest thing that happened during the first week of September was returning to school. From now on it means recalling the Russian children who went to school and never came home, and watching that Twin Towers footage over and over, ad infinitum. And if you think these anniversaries may one day pass unmarked by television, forget it. Come the end of August, seven years after the event, there's still room for a few Diana documentaries; the fact that there's really nothing left to say on the subject of a woman who died in a accidental car crash notwithstanding. BBC2 nearly pulled The Grid, which ran over three nights last week, because it featured a Chechen terrorist, but they would have been better off taking it out of the schedule for the simple reason that, despite its $20 million of co-production cash and a starry cast, it had apparently been scripted by Spock at his most dementedly logical. A slick thriller focusing on transatlantic tensions in the field of joint counter-terrorism, the first episode kicked off with a Sarin gas attack and closed with a handful of bombs, but scarifying timeliness alone was not enough to engage this viewer's emotions or, apparently, even those of the actors. Julianna Margulies, in particular, delivered most of her lines as if she was reading from cue cards, while a let's-help-Middle- America-understand-the- Middle-East approach to the screenplay made for some of the most excruciating exposition ever committed to film. 'Islam inspired a humane civilisation and made some of the greatest contributions to the culture of mankind,' corrected one counter-terrorism character, face full of po, after Margulies had embarked on a rant about the perceived subjugation of Muslim women. In response to being shamelessly patronised surely most viewers on this side of the pond would have shouted 'shut up and get on with the plot...' Or was that just me? Then it turned out that those few bits of the script that hadn't been penned by Spock and rewritten by the Inter-Faith Committee For Wearisome Political Correctness had been got at by an undercover operative disguised as a dandy highwayman: 'Don't drink, don't smoke, what do you do?' inquired Jemma Redgrave of another Goody Two Shoes spook; to which Adam Ant would have replied: 'Put on a little make-up, make-up / Make sure they get your good side, good side'. In contrast to The Grid, I tuned into BBC2's Crisis Command: Could You Run the Country? expecting very little and ended up gripped, not to mention exhausted. This clever little exercise in scaring us witless made three members of the public government ministers for a day, gave them access to advice and information from assorted experts and stood by as they attempted to handle a national emergency by making decisions on a multiple choice basis. In this case, the first of four manufactured crises, it was an outbreak of plague in a Liverpool hospital. The quasi-cabinet comprised Andrew Morris, the boss of Earl's Court and Olympia, Sahar Hashemi, the co-founder of a chain of coffee shops, and Carmel McConnell, the chair of a children's charity, assisted by the former assistant chief of defence staff, Sir Timothy Garden, the ex-Conservative Party spinmistress, Amanda Platell, and a former emergency services adviser, Charles Shoebridge. The latter all bustled with convincing authority and clearly relished their improvised scripts, which involved barking stuff like, 'Ministers, please make decisions based on the facts as they actually stand rather than as you would wish them to be', which had the ring of truth. Meanwhile, as the plague scenario unfolded, with actors playing doctors in the hospital and riot police outside, the crisis cabinet made one bad decision after another, after another. Having ordered hospital staff to treat infected patients before contamination suits had arrived, rejected the help of the army, attempted to evacuate non-plague patients instead of sealing the hospital, vaccinated plague victims instead of emergency services staff and employed riot control measures to combat escapees but without authorising the use of firearms, they ended up making only two correct decisions: to be truthful with the media and tell them that there was an outbreak of plague, and to authorise the use of vaccines still undergoing tests. Bizarrely, this all made for genuinely edge-ofthe- seat viewing. As they failed to contain the outbreak and watched films of the hordes (well, a hordlet of about six people - but this was the BBC) of panicked rioters breaking out of the hospital and taking to the streets of Liverpool, the Cabinet's expressions said a great deal, though the results of their actions said even more: 75,000 people infected, 49,000 dead and a cost of \u00a356 billion to the economy. There's no room for humane approaches in this kind of crisis, apparently - it's strictly a shoot-firstask- questions-later-andthen- try-suing-us scenario. Next week it's flooding. Better start building that Ark. What with being holed up at home and subject to televisual outbreaks of terrorism and plague, I was more than ready for the on-themoney (titlewise at least) new BBC1 series Should I Worry About...? presented by Richard Hammond, the glove compartment-sized accessory from Top Gear. What, after all, could possibly be left to worry about - other than, perhaps, for Hammond, the fact that the BBC had given him something tiny, pastel-coloured, girly, hatchbacky (Ford Pingu? Daihatsu Tweenie? Nissan Noddy?) and quite obviously mortifying to have to be seen driving as he buzzed chirpily round the country trying to prove that mobile phones fry our brains. Unfortunately nothing was proved other than that prime time programmes about how mobile phones might fry your brains are capable of turning the discerning viewer's mightiest organ into something resembling chopped liver. As investigations go this was presumably meant to be the week's light-ent. Finally, deadlines preclude me from ever reviewing the most recent Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, on BBC1, or the new ITV1 Parkinson (indistinguishable from the BBC version), so I ask you to cast your mind back a week or so, when Ross, who gives great Radio 2 but can't do interviews, 'interviewed' Paul Newman, while Parkinson, who can do interviews, was stuck with Tom Cruise, who looks as though he might, but doesn't. A guest-swap would have worked. Ross and Cruise could have joshed their way cheerfully through 15 minutes or so, while Parky would have made the most of Newman, who doesn't like interviews much but might have been seduced none the less. After Parky was forced to indulge Cruise's soliloquy on the subject of Scientology while ignoring the stuff we really want to know about, namely Nicole, I noticed that ITV1 screened the risible John Travolta movie Battlefield Earth, from an original load of old codswallop by L. Ron Hubbard. Just who is this Scientologist scheduler at ITV1 and how dare they hijack Saturday, currently the most banal but, thankfully, also the least doomladen night of the entire television week?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
