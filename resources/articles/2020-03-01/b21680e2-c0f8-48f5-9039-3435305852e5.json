The camera was operated by Hanson\u2019s aide James Ashby, the stream captioned like an official broadcast but published with hundreds of unfiltered live comments from apparently aggrieved fathers, who called witnesses and MPs \u201cman-hater\u201d and \u201cdirty snake\u201d. In the shadow of the murders of Hannah Clarke and her three children, expert witnesses have told the inquiry that reform to family law is increasingly urgent to better protect mostly women and children, primarily from men who perpetrate acts of coercive control and domestic violence. But in its first full week, most of the attention of the inquiry has been taken by debating discredited tropes: that women lie about domestic violence; that men\u2019s aggression is caused by partners who seek to deny access to their kids. A succession of fringe interest groups has been invited to give evidence. On Thursday the head of the Men\u2019s Rights Agency, Sue Price, made claims that there had been an \u201cincreasing number\u201d of false domestic violence allegations made by women. The Greens senator Larissa Waters challenged Price about why she did not believe women\u2019s accounts. \u201cWhen I talk to probably 5,000 men each year for 26 years, I think I get a pretty good handle on who is telling me the truth,\u201d Price said. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t talk to the women, we\u2019re a men\u2019s rights agency. I talk to many, many men who tell me that \u2026 lies have been told.\u201d Waters then brought up the evidence of multiple experts and researchers who had told the inquiry that the existence of a domestic violence order or unproven allegation did not provide any benefit in family court proceedings. \u201cI don\u2019t think the experts know what they\u2019re talking about on these issues,\u201d Price responded. Hannah Clarke would have found it \u2018impossible\u2019 Zoe Rathus, an expert on family law and domestic violence at Griffith University, told the inquiry the legislated presumption of equal shared parental responsibility had proved \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d and acted to prevent people from airing allegations of domestic violence in the family court. Rathus said that danger was particularly apparent in situations like the one faced by Clarke, where the behaviour of her estranged husband, Rowan Baxter, had been abusive and controlling but not physically violent. \u201cHannah Clarke was allowing Baxter to see the children on a regular basis,\u201d Rathus said. \u201c[The presumption in favour of equal shared parental responsibility] would have been part of all of the information that she will have been given. It would have been almost impossible for her to have resisted doing that. \u201cAnd if she had, it would have been very possible for him to accuse her of being an alienator, particularly as this is not a case that would have been described as aggressive violence. We know that family violence can be most dangerous when it isn\u2019t necessarily aggressive.\u201d Hanson said the murders of Clarke and her children were horrific and \u201cshould never happen. But it\u2019s on both sides.\u201d \u201cI read your report and it is all about women,\u201d she told Rathus. \u201cDo you agree that there are men that are aggrieved? That there are men that are victims of domestic violence? That there are men that, you know, are taking their own lives?\u201d Rathus responded: \u201cI would prefer if you didn\u2019t ask me if I admitted things. I\u2019m not really here to admit things, senator. I\u2019m here to present my research. I\u2019ve been working in this area since 1981. \u201cThe statistics are very clear \u2013 that domestic violence is something that is very gendered and that violence in the home happens more often by men towards women.\u201d Inquiry may encourage \u2018emotive responses from disaffected fathers\u2019 Rathus had expressed concern in her submission that the inquiry\u2019s terms of reference might unfortunately \u201cattract submissions and information from fathers who wish to claim that their former partner lied about violence in the relationship\u201d. \u201cAlthough it is true that both men and women do not always tell the truth in family law proceedings, this [inquiry] may encourage individual emotive responses from disaffected fathers which will draw sympathy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is almost certainly easier, and more common, for a perpetrator to dishonestly deny violence than for a \u2018non-victim\u2019 to make it up.\u201d Rathus and others have cited a Canadian study that showed non-custodial parents, usually fathers, most frequently made intentionally false reports. Throughout the first week of hearings, Hanson and others have used mostly anecdotal accounts to support their positions, including seven-year-old comments from a retired New South Wales judge. Price, from the Men\u2019s Rights Agency, said the Australian Institute of Criminology \u201cinflated\u201d its figures on parental homicide because it did not distinguish murders committed by stepfathers from biological fathers. Hanson cited government statistics that \u201cone woman a week and one man a month were killed by a current or former partner\u201d from 2012 to 2014. Samantha Jeffries, a criminologist from Griffith University, said those figures did not tell the full story about intimate-partner violence. \u201cThe fact that women kill their intimate partners, that\u2019s usually done in retaliation, so it\u2019s usually self-defence because they\u2019ve been victims of domestic violence over a long period of time,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cMany of the domestic violence death review committees have come to that conclusion, that when women kill their intimate partners it\u2019s usually because they\u2019ve been victims of domestic violence. When men kill their intimate partners it\u2019s because they\u2019ve had a long history of perpetrating domestic violence. There\u2019s a difference. You can throw the stats around, but the background and the reason is very different.\u201d Hanson replied: \u201cWe can all throw stats around to suit our own agenda.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s that urgency that\u2019s driving us\u2019 Last year, the Australian Law Reform Commission finished its own detailed inquiry into the family law system. The decision to hold a parliamentary investigation was largely viewed as a concession to Hanson, whose One Nation party holds an influential position on the Senate crossbench. Hanson was made the deputy chair. On Thursday, she introduced herself as the \u201cco-chair\u201d of the inquiry. There is no live video broadcast supplied by the parliament, but the committee has agreed to an unusual filming protocol that allows members, their staff or the media to record. The video feed allows One Nation to give its own social media audience a window into the half-empty committee rooms. After the hearing is adjourned, Hanson responds directly to dozens of the comments made during her own live video feed. Larissa Waters, the Greens spokesperson for women, said the decision to hold another inquiry, rather than implement the law reform commission\u2019s recommendations, was \u201ca sop to One Nation\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s become One Nation\u2019s Queensland state election campaign, and women and children are the collateral damage,\u201d Waters said. Witnesses have told Guardian Australia they are concerned at the direction of the inquiry, and in particular that the legitimacy of the parliament has now been loaned to several groups promoting fringe, discredited and dangerous views. Angela Lynch, of the Women\u2019s Legal Service Queensland, said the process was \u201cpotentially dangerous\u201d because it delayed the implementation of needed reforms to prioritise the safety of victims of domestic violence. \u201cFor 25 or 30 years, these groups have consistently been saying the same thing, that women make up allegations of domestic violence, they stop men from seeing children. But they cannot point to any credible research that backs up these claims. It\u2019s the most over-researched, over-inquired area where we\u2019ve had inquiry after inquiry after inquiry. In any credible inquiry nowhere have they ever found evidence that\u2019s the situation.\u201d Lynch said she had concerns about what the parliamentary inquiry would ultimately decide, but that the urgent need for reform meant groups like the women\u2019s legal service were determined to participate. \u201cThe issue is that there\u2019s a level of urgency now. In the light of the Hannah Clarke murder, that really illustrates the danger that children and women are in. It\u2019s not something that can wait. It\u2019s that urgency that\u2019s driving us at the moment.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
