It had been refinished in black, to look like a larger version of the guitar John Lennon played at the peak of Beatlemania. Maroon's band, the Walkmen, were at a low, without a label, a manager or a studio. The Rickenbacker's clanging, chiming tone would be the sound of their comeback. On their 2008 album You &amp; Me, Maroon's playing was the perfect sparring partner for frontman Hamilton Leithauser's distinctive howl. Until one afternoon, at the Vogue theatre in Indianapolis, Leithauser tripped on a lead, knocking the Capri to the floor and snapping its neck. The New Yorkers had destroyed instruments before. When they smashed an upright piano outside Birmingham Academy, they left it on the street and bought another one for \u00a350 the next day. This guitar was different. There are so few of that model in circulation that it was impossible to replace. The band's engineer thought they could never make another record without it. In fact, in keeping with the cussed logic of a career characterised by bad breaks and setbacks, their next album, Lisbon, turned out to be their best yet. In a decade making music together, the band's habits and preferences have set hard, becoming what Leithauser calls \"stupid unspoken policies\". Rule No 1: All equipment must be vintage. Rule No 2: However valuable the instrument, it should be carried in a cheap, flimsy bag. Rule No 3: No guitar stands, because an antique Fender looks much cooler propped against a speaker. There are other tacit commandments relating to songwriting, rehearsal and doing business, most of which have backfired at some point, but the more idiosyncratic the rule, the more stubbornly they observe it. It is no coincidence that they have passed through five different record labels in six albums. \"I honestly think we're not difficult to work with, but we've been told that so many times it's difficult to argue,\" Leithauser admits. \"How can you keep blaming the next guy?\" Leithauser and his cousin, bassist Walter Martin, are intimidatingly tall and handsome, with the patrician self-confidence that comes from being a popular kid at an exclusive school. In some parallel, Mad Men universe, they would be decorated fighter pilots and an unbeatable doubles pair at the tennis club. But in Brooklyn, here and now, an affordable, slightly sketchy neighbourhood is the furthest their income will stretch. \"I think we do all right,\" says Leithauser, over a glass of red wine in their local. \"But we have friends who are in bands that are a lot more successful than us. We toured with Kings of Leon, Vampire Weekend, Spoon, Interpol, the Black Keys. They're at a level where they can hire people to do the jobs we do each night, which gets to be a real drag.\" A perennial support act, the Walkmen still carry their own amps. Leithauser has been preoccupied with the ageing process since he was a teenager. A track by his pre-Walkmen group, the Recoys, begins: \"Yeah, I'm getting older/ That's what I told her,\" picking up a theme he has revisited on every Walkmen album. On the nearest thing the Walkmen have had to a hit, The Rat, he worried that he was becoming antisocial and isolated in his 20s: \"When I used to go out I would know everyone that I saw/ Now I go out alone if I go out at all.\" Questions about lyrical inspiration are deflected with a stock answer along the lines of \"the music always comes first\", but Leithauser's world-weary, defiant narrative voice is unmistakable. On their biggest-selling album, 2004's Bows + Arrows, it's notable how angry he sounds. \"That first line of The Rat \u2013 'You've got a nerve \u2026' \u2013 I had that in about 10 seconds. I don't know if I was feeling like going out and beating someone up, but that's what it sounds like,\" he says. The Walkmen are obsessed with old things, so it makes sense they should age well themselves. Leithauser has penned handfuls of songs about settling down, many of them sceptical about whether it's possible to change, but as the band have married and moved apart (Peter Bauer, Matt Barrick and Maroon have kids and Leithauser's first is on the way) he's become an acute observer of doubt and regret, redeemed by an optimistic streak. Lisbon's narrator has found a modicum of peace, although he's still searching for a song to \"slow down all the madness\" and wondering why his friends are drunk and lonely. The record's centrepiece, Victory, is a plea for recognition: \"My Lord, where's the satisfaction? It's all uphill for me \u2026 Victory should be mine.\" Leithauser admits to feeling hard done by, but accepts the Walkmen haven't made it easy for themselves. Long before he broke Maroon's guitar, he broke the guitarist's arm, above the elbow, in a wrestling match to celebrate finishing their first album. \"He was facing one way and I had half his arm in my hand, facing the other. In the first white flash of terror, when he started screaming, I thought I'd ripped his arm off.\" They followed up Bows + Arrows with A Hundred Miles Off, which made up for what it lacked in memorable songs with pummelling aggression. \"It was the height of our popularity and we sucked,\" Leithauser says. \"It was pure volume, so fast and loud.\" A track-by-track remake of Harry Nilsson and Lennon's album of covers, Pussy Cats, alienated as many fans as it confused. At their lowest point, a bill arrived from Heathrow airport, demanding \u00a31,000 for the destruction of 2,000 copies of their debut album. It was never paid. Sun Records was a key inspiration for Lisbon, most apparent in the Tennessee Three chug of Blue As Your Blood and the backing vocals on All My Great Designs. Listening to Johnny Cash and Roy Orbison's early sides persuaded them to give Maroon's guitar lines plenty of space. The gear was appropriately ancient, too, of course, the Rickenbacker having been replaced by a 1957 Gretsch Streamliner. Unlike most bands, the Walkmen tape virtually everything live in the studio. They sometimes joke that they stumbled on their unusual, echoing drum sound because they didn't know how to mic the snare up close. Maroon finally got his Rickenbacker back last month, after it had been at the menders for two years. \"Three days after it was returned to me, New Orleans baggage handlers dropped the Gretsch, so I've sent it to be repaired by the same guy,\" he says. He has faith that it can be fixed. The Walkman play Oran Mor, Glasgow, on Wednesday, then tour."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
