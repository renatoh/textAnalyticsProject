Four constitutional scholars, including three called by Democrats and one called by Republicans, became the first witnesses to testify in a second round of public impeachment hearings beginning on Wednesday and expected to last until late next week. The hearings are the last stop before the proceedings could move to the House floor for a vote to impeach, or not to impeach, Trump, which could take place before a holiday break beginning on 20 December. The committee chairman, Jerry Nadler, said that Trump was the first president to engage in conduct that met all three criteria for impeachment contemplated by the framers of the constitution: abuse of power, betrayal of national security, and interference in the conduct of elections. \u201cNever before has a president engaged in a course of conduct that included all the acts that most concerned the framers,\u201d Nadler said. Nadler was echoed by witnesses including Gerhardt. \u201cIf Congress fails to impeach here, then the impeachment process has lost all meaning, and, along with that, our constitution\u2019s carefully crafted safeguards against the establishment of a king on American soil,\u201d Gerhardt said. The witness called by Republicans, George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, offered an opposing view, saying that the impeachment process was being rushed. \u201cWe are all mad and where has it taken us?\u201d Turley said. \u201cWill a slipshod impeachment make us less mad or will it only give an invitation for the madness to follow in every future administration?\u201d As the new high-stakes phase of the impeachment inquiry began, Republicans resorted to procedural objections and high-temperature harangues in an effort to protect Trump. The Republican side lodged a series of rapid-fire interruptions and parliamentary inquiries as the hearing began, interrupting the first witnesses and leading Nadler to resort repeatedly to his gavel. The Georgia congressman Doug Collins, the top Republican on the committee, accused Democrats of moving to impeach Trump \u201cbecause you just don\u2019t like the guy\u201d. \u201cThe American people is [sic] really gonna look at this and say, \u2018Huh? What are we doing?\u2019\u201d Collins said. In his opening remarks, the ranking member laced into the Democrats for pursuing what he called a \u201csimple railroad job\u201d \u2013 and then mocked the legal scholars sitting before him. \u201cWe\u2019ve got law professors here,\u201d he said sarcastically. \u201cWhat a start to a party.\u201d Democrats accuse Trump of misusing the powers of his office for personal gain by pressuring Ukraine to manufacture negative headlines about Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s political rival. Trump also stands accused of obstructing a congressional investigation by ordering subordinates not to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. The charges are laid out in a 300-page report referred to the judiciary committee late on Tuesday by Adam Schiff\u2019s intelligence committee, which has led the process to this point. The judiciary committee has historically been the place where articles of impeachment originate. Wednesday\u2019s hearing is the only one scheduled before the committee so far, with more expected. Democrats expect the committee to wrap its work within two weeks, though there is no set calendar. Republicans led by Collins tried to upend the hearings on Wednesday by objecting on procedural grounds and foregrounding Trump\u2019s fiercest defenders, including the congressmen Jim Jordan of Ohio and John Ratcliffe of Texas. Also sitting on the judiciary committee is Matt Gaetz of Florida, who made a splash last month when he led a group of Republican lawmakers into the secure basement facility where the impeachment inquiry was proceeding. On Wednesday, Gaetz tore into a witness, the Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan, for a joke she made about the president\u2019s youngest son\u2019s name: \u201cThe constitution says there can be no titles of nobility,\u201d Karlan said, \u201cso while the president can name his son Barron, he cannot make him a baron.\u201d The joke also drew censure from the first lady, Melania Trump, who tweeted: \u201cA minor child deserves privacy and should be kept out of politics.\u201d Late in the hearing, after the first lady\u2019s tweet had been read into the record, Karlan apologized, saying: \u201cIt was wrong of me to do that.\u201d Testimony on Wednesday proceeded under rules familiar from the previous public hearings, with 45-minute chunks of questioning time at the top for the committee leaders and staff, followed by five-minute blocks for each member. Norm Eisen, a former chief White House ethics lawyer, acted as chief questioner for the Democrats. The day\u2019s panel included three witnesses called by Democrats \u2013 the Harvard law professor Noah Feldman, Karlan and Gerhardt \u2013 and one called by Republicans, Turley. \u201cThis is not just about our national interests to protect elections or make sure Ukraine stays strong and fights the Russians so we don\u2019t have to fight them here, but it\u2019s in our national interest to promote democracy worldwide,\u201d Karlan said. In an interview with the Guardian last month, Gerhardt said that in spite of Republican complaints that Trump had not been given sufficient opportunity to defend himself in the impeachment proceedings, the House process had been \u201cextremely fair\u201d. \u201cI think that because the constitution says the House has the sole power to impeach, there\u2019s no role for the president to dictate how he should be involved, who should bring a lawyer and things like that \u2013 it\u2019s left to the discretion of the House, and the House I believe in this situation has been extremely fair,\u201d Gerhardt said. The White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, informed Nadler earlier this week Trump and his lawyers would not participate in Wednesday\u2019s hearing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
