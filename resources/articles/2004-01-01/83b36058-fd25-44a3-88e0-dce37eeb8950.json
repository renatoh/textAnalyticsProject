The Universities and Colleges Employers Association (Ucea) remained confident that the remaining two unions yet to sign up to the National Framework Agreement, (not including the AUT) will be on side by mid-February. Ucea is still in talks with lecturers' union Natfhe and the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS). \"We're confident we are addressing the outstanding concerns of Natfhe and the EIS,\" said the head of Ucea, Jocelyn Prudence, adding: \"The AUT is at odds with their union colleagues.\" The particulars under negotiation with Natfhe and EIS concern job evaluation, pay progression, guards against a rise in inflation, rights for hourly paid staff and the creation of a library of role profiles for academic staff. Talks between the employers and the AUT, which represents staff from the old universities, broke down in mid-December. The AUT is now balloting over industrial action. The pay and modernisation plan put forth by the employers has been accepted by more than 50% of higher education staff, mostly in support and maintenance roles, who have benefited from it since November, with pay changes backdated to August 1 2003. The pay structure brings all university staff - from porters to professors - under a single pay spine, but it will be localised depending on the individual needs of each institution and is based on job evaluations. The employers had invited the union to visit universities with the agreement already in place. Its assistant director, Declan Leyden, said: \"We offered to go visit some universities to persuade them that their concerns about earnings levels were not real. They interpreted it as the need to change the agreement. That was not on offer. What was on offer was evidence-based persuasion.\" The AUT was not impressed with the employers' methods of persuasion. \"The proposals do not allow us to represent our senior administrative and related members at a national level,\" the AUT general secretary, Sally Hunt, wrote in an editorial in the January edition of the union's monthly magazine. She urged the AUT's 47,000 members to categorically refuse employers' proposals. She wrote: \"To put it quite bluntly, I think you should reject the current proposals. And I think you should so decisively.\" Possible action includes an initial walk-out of universities, backed up by boycotts of assessment activity, job evaluation and staff appraisal schemes, and call-out cover."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
