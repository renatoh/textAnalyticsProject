The European Network on Debt and Development (Eurodad) says some development finance institutions (DFIs), which are playing an increasing role in supporting development programmes, offer \"minimal support\" to companies in low-income countries, favouring organisations domiciled in wealthy states. Recipient governments, it claims, have little influence over investments made in their countries. After two years of research, Eurodad found that between 2006 and 2010 only a quarter of companies supported by the EU's European Investment Bank (EIB) and the World Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC) were domiciled in low-income countries. \"Eurodad's principal concern is that almost all DFIs are owned and controlled by rich country governments, with little effective input or influence from developing country governments, and even less from other developing country stakeholders,\" Eurodad says in the report. \"This imbalance in power structures means, among other things, that companies from wealthy nations have often received the lion's share of contracts. Investments are sometimes routed through tax havens, helping to legitimise their role in the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars to developing countries through tax dodging by multinationals.\" The report states that the financial sector has been singled out for particular attention from DFIs in recent years. More than 50% of funding for the private sector went to financial organisations, a move Eurodad says raised serious questions about the kind of impact the investment would have on the ground following the recent financial crisis that \"was driven by irresponsible investment decisions and financial deregulation\". A lack of transparency had led to investments that have a questionable impact on development, says the report. It cites investments by Britain's aid investment arm, CDC, in gated communities, shopping centres and luxury property developments in developing countries. Investors justified its funding on the basis of job creation, but critics said these investments were not a good use of aid money. Eurodad is calling for a review of DFI operations by a committee of independent experts from governments of low-income countries, civil society groups and the private sector in developing countries. It wants to see financial institutions align their investment decisions with the priorities and development plans of low-income countries, demonstrate clear financial and development benefits from their investments, and comply with responsible finance guidelines. \"DFIs are not the right organisations to deliver on development goals, and their huge expansion is extremely worrying when so many questions about their operations remain,\" says Maria Jos\u00e9 Romero, the report's author. \"They are controlled by developed countries, with little input into strategies or governance from developing countries. Not only does this make them less likely to align their investments with national plans and needs, but also means they will always be likely to be influenced by the desire to support companies from their home country. In fact, several have this objective in their mandate, which can only divert attention from pure development objectives.\" According to the report, the amount of money being channelled through the private sector by 2015 is expected to exceed $100bn, almost two-thirds of official development assistance (ODA), as donors look for alternative ways to fund development programmes. The recent financial crisis has seen aid budgets squeezed. The UK's Department for International Development has made clear its intention to work more with the private sector to boost economic growth overseas. In May, the European commission laid out its intention to use its political muscle to encourage more private sector investment in poorer countries. The role of the private sector in development is expected to be further enhanced \u2013 and scrutinised \u2013 over the coming year, as governments debate how the next set of development goals (the sustainable development goals) will be funded from 2015. A big meeting of stakeholders is expected to take place next summer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
