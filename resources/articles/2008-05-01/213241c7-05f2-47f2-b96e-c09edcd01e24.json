Jamie Baulch, Iwan Thomas, Roger Black and Mark Richardson were the 4x400 metres team beaten into second place at the 1997 World Championships in Athens by the United States ,whose team included Pettigrew and who has now admitted he was taking banned performance-enhancing drugs at the time. The International Association of Athletics Federations have the power to strip athletes of medals they won if they later admit doping, but only if the evidence emerges within eight years of the event having taken place. But they may be willing to reconsider that if UK Athletics appeal. Black has said that he would like to be awarded the gold medal, but he is not going to pursue it actively. Thomas, however, said that he wants the result reversed. 'I'd love to be told I was going to get a gold medal,' he said. 'I'd much rather be talking to you with a gold medal around my neck.' Baulch also wants UK Athletics to take up the case on his behalf. 'You can't go back in time,' he said. 'It won't mean the same thing. It means something on the podium. The only thing I'd get out of it would be justice.' But Richardson has said that getting the gold medal now would be 'a hollow victory'. 'What difference does it make? Does it mean that we get to go up on to the rostrum and savour the moment? No. Does it mean that the race is going to be re-run and we come out victorious? No.' Pettigrew's admission that he used performance-enhancing substances during a long, successful sprinting career in which he passed all drug tests came during the last day of testimony for the government in the trial of his former coach, Trevor Graham, who is accused of lying to federal authorities investigating doping in sports. Graham has pleaded not guilty. Observer Sport reported earlier this month that Pettigrew would admit his guilt. Pettigrew testified in the San Francisco courthouse that Graham encouraged him in 1997 to inject human growth hormone and the oxygen-boosting drug EPO, both banned. Soon after, Pettigrew said, he began buying the drugs from Angel 'Memo' Heredia, an admitted steroids dealer from Texas. 'Throughout my whole career I believed I was on a level playing field,' said Thomas. Thomas said that after the race in Athens Pettigrew had given them no inkling that he had cheated. 'Obviously he wasn't that worried,' he said. 'He did look us in the eye and shake our hands and say 'Well done'. Unfortunately people do bad things in life.' Niels de Vos, the chief executive of UK Athletics, told Observer Sport last night that he would spend the next few days seeking clarification of the situation involving Pettigrew before deciding whether to launch an appeal. But he said that the trial is demonstrating that the American authorities did not take the problem of doping seriously. The ease with which Pettigrew apparently managed to avoid any positive drugs test during his career comes after Marion Jones admitted she passed more than 160 tests before she confessed to her long-term doping use. 'They didn't have a robust system at all,' said De Vos. 'They didn't do out-of-competition testing at all. Frankly, the American system was set up to help them to avoid testing. But post-2001 it is a lot, lot tougher.' The US 4x400m relay team that won at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, which included Michael Johnson, is also set to be stripped of its gold medals after Pettigrew's admission. The IOC said they are studying the situation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
