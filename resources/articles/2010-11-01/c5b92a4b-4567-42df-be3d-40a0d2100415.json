Michael Oliver, the youngest referee to graduate to the Premier League, had cost them a place in the top four, ended their eight-match unbeaten run and given them a tower to climb in Blackpool with two red cards inside 29 minutes. Obvious but not entirely accurate. Their ordeal was also self-inflicted. An enthralling, often ludicrous game at Bloomfield Road brought pride for Roberto Di Matteo and relief for Ian Holloway in terms of performance. Blackpool climbed to ninth in the table thanks to a first home victory in the top flight since April 1971 and have taken 10 games to demolish pre-season theories they are destined to record the lowest points tally in Premier League history. \"We had to build a new ground, we have the smallest budget ever and were probably the worst side to come up,\" said their manager. \"It is all stacked against us, but we won't go down.\" A conviction that a newly promoted team will survive this season would also be shared by Di Matteo on the basis of this spirited refusal to wilt. Had Steven Reid swept home from six yards in stoppage time the Italian could rightly have savoured one of the finest recoveries in recent years. Their ultimate response to a sense of injustice was inspired, yet the collective loss of heads that followed Pablo Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez's harsh dismissal on 10 minutes cost Albion as dearly as Oliver's first major decision. The visitors unnerved a wasteful Blackpool team with nine men. How they would have fared with 10 was hypothetical the moment Gonzalo Jara launched himself two-footed at Luke Varney, the match-winner. The visitors opened confidently against a Blackpool team that had lost four of their past five league games only for their prospects to deteriorate in the 10th minute. Charlie Adam, playing despite an ankle injury, again showed his speed of thought more than compensates for slower legs when he seized on a loose ball in central midfield and released DJ Campbell inside the Albion area. Campbell checked and was obstructed by Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez for a clear penalty but, to widespread disbelief, Oliver deemed the offence worthy of red. Adam duly maximised insult by driving his spot-kick through the grasp of Scott Carson. \"He's done it by the book but the book is wrong,\" said Holloway. \"It was a fantastic move, there was minimal contact but the law will say he denied a goalscoring opportunity. But he's still got Scott Carson to beat. I'd rather we scored the penalty and played against 11 men. We looked better then.\" Campbell's subsequent display in front of goal cast further doubt on how clear a goalscoring chance it was. Oliver invited criticism with his dismissal of Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez but, given what followed, it was to his credit that the game did not spiral out of control. The visitors' loss of self-control commenced when Gabriel Tamas, a supposedly hardened central defender, collapsed under a shoulder charge from Gary Taylor-Fletcher claiming he'd been struck in the face. Yousouf Mulumbu, booked for throwing the ball away, courted a second yellow with two reckless challenges, the second of which brought a foul and a look of incomprehension from the match official. Sandwiched in between was a second red card inside 20 minutes, and this time Albion could have no complaint. Varney miss-controlled a crossfield pass but just managed to keep the ball in play at the corner flag. He was going nowhere, the ball was rolling out, and yet Jara flew in with a two-footed challenge that demanded red. Quite rightly, it came. Di Matteo said: \"The second one is no discussion and it is a red card and probably because of the frustration of the first one.\" The odds were thrown in Blackpool's favour but it was the visitors who continued to construct the more intelligent attacking play. The home side looked to have secured victory when Varney slid home Elliot Grandin's low cross from the right but, when Mulumbu curled beyond Matthew Gilks with five minutes remaining, pandemonium took over. Holloway's team just held on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
