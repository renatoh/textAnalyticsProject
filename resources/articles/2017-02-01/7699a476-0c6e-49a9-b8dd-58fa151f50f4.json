The association\u2019s warning came in a submission to a parliamentary inquiry into laws that would increase the commissioner\u2019s powers to delay the resignation of officers by up to six months. The AFP has faced increased scrutiny over how it manages internal investigations of misconduct after the release of Elizabeth Broderick\u2019s report that found sexual harassment and bullying was rife. It is also under pressure over the effectiveness of mental health programs, after the suicide of an AFP officer at her office in Melbourne several weeks ago. But the agency has also sought to justify legislative changes put forward by the government to increase the commissioner\u2019s power to delay officers\u2019 resignations. Under the AFP Act, the commissioner has the power to delay an AFP officer resigning for 90 days if a serious internal investigation into his or her conduct is under way. The proposed changes would increase the commissioner\u2019s power to 180 days. The AFP said in its submission this was because once an officer resigned it had limited options to pursue administrative action against that officer. But the Australian Federal Police Association said in its submission that the increased power would only create further uncertainty for officers, and questioned whether the issue was due to resourcing of internal investigations by the AFP. The association\u2019s submission said: \u201cThe only practical purpose for this amendment appears to be that it will provide an extension of time for the AFP to undertake or continue an investigation into allegations of misconduct against employees, which is clearly a resource issue rather than an effective evidence-based improvement to the current regime.\u201d It said that delaying the ability to resign \u201ccontributes further to the imbalance of power already experienced between the AFP and its employees\u201d. \u201cThe amendment will unreasonably prolong the resignation process for employees, keeping them out of the workplace for longer periods and potentially preventing them from obtaining other employment or opportunities to move on with their lives,\u201d it said. The AFP submission argued that it was \u201cimperative that the AFP is able to investigate allegations of category-three misconduct while the person under investigation remains an AFP employee\u201d. It outlined several cases where the timeframes were inadequate: \u201cGenerally, this occurs because the employee is informed of the investigation, attempts to resign to avoid having their employment terminated, and the PRS [professional standards] investigation is unable to be completed within 90 days of the resignation date.\u201d Guardian Australia asked the AFP whether it could outline how many times the commissioner had exercised the power to delay the resignation of an officer. The AFP responded by saying \u201csupport for this amendment is not related to resourcing of the Professional Standards function. It is to ensure the AFP is able to maintain the integrity and professionalism of its workforce, as well as the confidence and trust of the community.\u201d The AFP is likely to face heavy questioning in Senate estimates on Tuesday about the fallout from the Broderick report and the suicide of the AFP officer. The new professional standards team \u201cSafe Place\u201d, tasked with investigating sexual harassment and discrimination, received 95 complaints in a three-month period, with a third of those relating to senior officers. Guardian Australia understands the agency will provide an update on some aspects of the AFP Safe Place program and the progress of investigations into misconduct. \u2022 Contact Paul Farrell securely using the Signal messaging app on +61 457 262 172 or using the Guardian\u2019s Securedrop server"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
