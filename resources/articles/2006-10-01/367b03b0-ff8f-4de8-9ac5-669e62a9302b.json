But a computer programme could slash the time it takes by spotting the telltale patterns and techniques used by individual artists. Using high-resolution scans of paintings, the Authentic software builds up a library of characteristics, such as brushstrokes, colours and type of canvas used, that form a \"fingerprint\" for a particular artist. A painting can then be compared against this fingerprint to help experts decide whether it is a fake. Igor Berezhnoy of the University of Maastricht, who developed the software with colleague Eric Postma, said the technique was not designed to replace the opinions of art historians but as a tool that would help them with their work. \"We do not play art experts and we do not make decisions,\" he said. \"We analyse, we give the data, the art experts make the final decision.\" Dr Berezhnoy used high-resolution transparencies of 195 paintings from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, eight of which are known fakes, to train his software to recognise the painter's style and techniques. The transparencies were made on film in controlled lighting conditions by the museum. Dr Berezhnoy's team made digital copies to apply image-processing techniques. \"We have shown that Van Gogh, towards the end of his career, started to use a lot of complementary colours, a combination of red-green and blue-yellow colours,\" he said. \"We also found out digitally that Van Gogh used those combinations like blue next to yellowy-orange to highlight certain things in his paintings - a female figure wearing a blue dress, for example, and the background of bright orange.\" The next step is to attach a neural network to the software so that it can learn further details about a painter. \"Every painter has a custom approach. With the brushstroke Van Gogh has a specific style, he doesn't hide his brushstrokes, whereas most of the renaissance painters are making photographs more or less,\" said Dr Berezhnoy. From this information Authentic will extract features such as the direction of a brushstroke, its orientation and its thickness to give more information on the style of an artist. Dr Berezhnoy said that, when examining a possible forgery, this detailed information could be projected back on to the art to show what parts of the new painting are similar to a painter's style."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
