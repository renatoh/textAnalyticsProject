He has a good band, but the dominant sound is always his own keyboards, cleverly split and hooked up to a vast array of sounds. One number begins with a cadenza that runs through all his favourite patches - glassy synth, groovy B3 organ, spiky Rhodes - before diving into a blistering piano trio workout, mutating from hammering funk to superfast jazz. He even throws in a \"big band\" ensemble from Miles Ahead. When they launch into The Black Messiah, part II, the whole sextet, including extra synth player Robert Brookins and bassist Michael Manson, have fun with the big keyboard stabs, throwing the composition's natural drama into comical relief. Duke pays tribute to another influential former boss - Frank Zappa - with a soulful version of Uncle Remus. But for Duke, the influence of Julian \"Cannonball\" Adderley, in whose band he played in the 1970s, is more fundamental. Cannonball pulled it all together - jazz, funk, soul and gospel - and taught by example. Duke learnt fast: that you can be deadly serious about your music and still fool around; that you can be confident without being arrogant; that you can be a showman without pandering to the lowest common denominator. Drummer Gordon Campbell has a relaxed, open feel, whether driving breezily through Brazilian Love Affair, holding down the choppy arrangement of My Piano (from Duke's latest album Face The Music) or powering some deep, \"uncut funk\". When they encore with the relaxed groove of Six O'Clock in the Morning, he invites musicians from the audience to join in - a confident young keyboard dude and a scat-singing woman. This is the new mainstream, and it works. Duke's exuberance comes from the sheer physical and intellectual pleasure of playing music, and the audience is close enough to get a contact high."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
