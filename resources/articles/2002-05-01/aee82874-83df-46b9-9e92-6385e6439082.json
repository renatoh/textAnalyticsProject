Am I doing something wrong or are they all like this? TL, business graduate, Woking If agencies you're registered with aren't finding anything suitable, then either they've misunderstood your needs or you've chosen the wrong organisation. The prospect of having someone else seek out the right vacancies to apply for is a beguiling one. However, you may need to lend a helping hand. Check whether they've found your preferred type of work for others with similar qualifications and experience. If they're not keen to persuade you to register with them, this relationship won't work. It's essential to be very clear about the type of work you want. If you're uncertain and just hope the agency will find something to catch your interest, they'll be less keen to help; agencies prefer those with firm ideas. They need impressive candidates and will select those they perceive as committed to jobs they're recruiting for. Demonstrate enthusiasm by keeping in regular contact. An agency which thinks you're half hearted or using lots of others is less likely to give you individual attention. Indications that they're going to actively promote your cause include constructive advice on adapting your CV, help with interview preparation and reassurance that they have faith in you. Membership of an organisation like the Recruitment and Employment Confederation www.rec.uk.com means they subscribe to a code of conduct which can have an effect on the quality of their service. irenek@lycos.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
