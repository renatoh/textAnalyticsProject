Police bureau chief Larry O\u2019Dea shot a close friend in the back while hunting last month in Harney County, 350 miles east from Portland, according to officials investigating the case. He initially told local police that the injured man had accidentally shot himself. The disclosure of the shooting one month after it happened and the revelation that O\u2019Dea may have misled law enforcement in the aftermath have sparked widespread criticisms of the chief and Portland\u2019s mayor, making the liberal west coast city the latest US municipality to be caught up in a major police misconduct controversy. The San Francisco police chief resigned last week in the wake of numerous scandals, Oakland police are battling multiple officer misconduct allegations, and chiefs across the country have lost their jobs in the face of controversial cases over the last year. Mayor Charlie Hales announced Tuesday that he has placed O\u2019Dea on administrative leave, pending the outcome of an ongoing investigation. \u201cWe need our Police Bureau operating at its best, and our officers can\u2019t do that when there\u2019s turmoil and confusion surrounding their leader,\u201d Hales said in a statement. \u201cChief O\u2019Dea has been providing excellent service as our police chief, and now needs to focus on these investigations.\u201d On 21 April, the Harney County sheriff\u2019s office responded to 911 call about a 54-year-old man who had been shot. Sheriff Dave Ward \u201cwas told that it was a self-inflicted accidental shooting\u201d, according to a statement he released Monday. \u201cFurther information was gathered which contradicted this,\u201d according to Ward\u2019s office, which said O\u2019Dea did not identify himself as a police chief or as an officer. Ward did not learn of O\u2019Dea\u2019s background and his role in the shooting until 16 May, according to the sheriff. Ward declined to comment further on Tuesday, but told the Oregonian that he only uncovered the truth when he interviewed the injured man last week. \u201cThe victim made it pretty clear he didn\u2019t shoot himself,\u2019\u2019 Ward told the paper, noting that O\u2019Dea and several companions had initially misled police. \u201cThe victim knew who shot him.\u2019\u2019 O\u2019Dea has offered little comment about the case, which is now under investigation by Oregon state police and the state department of justice. Portland sergeant Peter Simpson described the shooting in an email as a \u201cnegligent discharge from [O\u2019Dea\u2019s] .22 caliber rifle that injured one of his very close friends\u201d. O\u2019Dea added in a statement: \u201cI\u2019m very thankful that my friend is OK and I\u2019m tremendously upset this happened.\u201d Simpson said O\u2019Dea is barred from commenting further while the state police and internal investigations are pending. Ward and other critics have questioned why both the chief and Portland mayor, who serves as the city\u2019s police commissioner, did not immediately disclose to Harney County investigators that O\u2019Dea was the shooter. Hales\u2019 spokeswoman Sara Hottman wrote in an email: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason the Mayor\u2019s Office would contact the Harney County Sheriff\u2019s Office; investigators would contact us if they had questions.\u201d Hales initially released a sympathetic statement last week, saying, \u201cLarry O\u2019Dea is a great chief, who is heartsick over hurting a friend.\u201d The state justice department declined to comment. Teressa Raiford, a lead organizer with Don\u2019t Shoot Portland, an activist group that has protested Portland police, said the scandal reflected systemic problems within the law enforcement agency. \u201cThere\u2019s no accountability. There\u2019s no oversight,\u201d said Raiford, who was recently acquitted on a charge that she obstructed traffic during a Black Lives Matter protest. \u201cI hope this breaks down that culture.\u201d When O\u2019Dea stepped up as chief in 2015, activists hoped he would prioritize reforms. \u201cWe thought it was an opportunity for a new culture of accountability,\u201d Raiford said. \u201cWithin one year, we\u2019re not seeing that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
