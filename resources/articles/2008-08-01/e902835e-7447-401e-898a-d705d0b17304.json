I'd club together with a bunch of foodie mates and buy a whole lamb carcass from my favourite butcher for around \u00a350. We'd get together over a few beers, cut it up ourselves and freeze the bits. Job done - best part of two hundred quid saved. I started calling around. After working my way through the relevant section of my phone book it became quickly and bewilderingly apparent that no-one I know has a freezer; at least nothing beyond a tiny thing for keeping vodka cold and making ice. Not a single one of them, and bear in mind these are people who love to cook, had a full-sized chest or upright freezer. What on earth was going on? When questioned, a lot of them mentioned Iceland in appalled tones. Something about the ubiquity of their ads (particularly the abominable 'driving home for Christmas'), thoughts of frozen turkey twizzlers and an entire Christmas dinner for \u00a39.99. Some talked about their own parents, about stained fingers at the PYO farm, Mum endlessly blanching veg and uninspiring dinners of freezer-burned runner beans. The Technicals - the deep food-geeks - waffled about ice crystals damaging cell structures. There were other excuses too but the real reason seemed clear: the whole idea of freezing is just a bit too naff for the fashionable modern food lover. Fortunately normal people don't seem to have such prejudices. According to a story in today's Guardian, the specialist frozen food retailers are seeing sales go up while regular supermarkets are suffering. Perhaps foodies are put off by the associations with thrift or a perception that low cost food is low quality, but anyone with a family to feed on a shrinking budget sees it as a distinctly smart idea. Frankly, I just don't get it. I love my freezer. With bulk-made dishes, gluts from market or garden, coffee beans, leftovers and ice-cream I sometimes don't even have space for the vodka. Then there are the small quantities of things that I just couldn't keep to hand without the freezer, cubes of frozen cream, wine, stock, demi-glace, chopped fresh herbs, chunks of pancetta, horseradish root and lime leaves. Though it would be nice to have a root cellar, an apple shed, a still room, a game larder and a small dairy, my freezer does duty for all of them - and doesn't contain a single turkey twizzler. So what's wrong with us? While the nation's mums have gone to Iceland, have foodies really forgotten the freezer?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
