Johnson launched the London Rental Standard \u2013 the first citywide scheme to accredit good landlords and letting agents \u2013 in May last year. The aim, he said, was to \u201cimprove the experience of everyone involved, from landlord to tenant, with a clear set of good practice rules\u201d. The scheme\u2019s target was to accredit 100,000 landlords and agents by 2016. \u201cIn time, the London Rental Standard will become an instantly recognisable feature of London\u2019s lettings industry, helping Londoners to pick between the huge array of landlords and agents on offer,\u201d said the news release for the launch. But more than a year later, the official website shows that by mid-June only 14,452 landlords and 339 letting and managing agent firms had signed up \u2013 far short of the 2016 target figure. Research by the Green party suggested it had failed to gain currency with lettings agents or tenants, despite a marketing budget of \u00a3250,000. In 62,521 listings for rented homes on property website Zoopla in July, the scheme was mentioned in just 114 adverts - 0.2% of the total. Most were in listings posted by one agent in Whitechapel, Prime Estate Agents, which included it in a list of schemes it was accredited by. Green London Assembly member Darren Johnson said: \u201cVoluntary accreditation schemes only work if tenants know to look out for the badge, creating demand that landlords might respond to. Even the agents who are members of the scheme don\u2019t publicise it, and don\u2019t let tenants search for accredited landlords. \u201cThe scheme is a flop, and is no substitute for adequate regulations.\u201d He called for compulsory licences for all landlords, and said more secure tenancies and rent controls were needed to protect tenants. Dan Wilson Craw, of the campaign group Generation Rent, said there were several problems with the Rental Standard. \u201cIt is basic, basic stuff. If a landlord isn\u2019t already doing most of these things, they\u2019re probably breaking the law,\u201d he said. \u201cThe scheme is a long way off critical mass and having currency among tenants. Even if it achieved that, there\u2019s nothing forcing landlords who don\u2019t comply to get better, and with demand so high those landlords will always find tenants.\u201d While larger-scale agents, such as Foxtons and Winkworth, have previously blogged about joining the scheme, the Greens pointed out that it was not mentioned in their ads for rented properties. A Foxtons spokeswoman said: \u201cAs one of the initial agents to sign up to the London Rental Standard, Foxtons fully supports any initiative that helps to raise standards within the private rental sector and with the backing of the mayor of London, it\u2019s gained great momentum.\u201d Richard Blakeway, deputy mayor for housing, land and property, said London was one of the first cities to set professional standards for its rented sector. \u201cOver 130,000 properties are now managed under the London Rental Standard, with a rapid growth in the number of accredited agents who manage the bulk of rental homes,\u201d he said. \u201cThis ambitious project is one of a range of policies pioneered by the mayor to support 2 million Londoners renting, including the creation of a long-term, institutionally backed private-rented market and \u2018rent to buy\u2019 to help people convert rent into equity.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
