Specialist retailers including HMV and Game, as well as major supermarket chains Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 big sellers of physical entertainment products \u2013 bore the brunt of the \u00a350m year-on-year fall in quarterly sales as Amazon increased its market dominance. Total sales of physical entertainment products fell by 19% year-on-year from \u00a3263.9m to \u00a3214m in the second quarter, according to market research firm Kantar. Struggling HMV, which has shut 27 stores this year, suffered the biggest fall in market share from 17.7% to 14.4%. Game fell from 8.1% to 7.6%. The market share at Tesco, which has just announced 4,500 job cuts, fell from 10.3% to 8.3% year on year. Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s both recorded a fall in their market share fall from 7.3% to 6.3%. Morrison\u2019s was the only major supermarket chain to post a share rise, albeit just 0.3% to 3.3%. However, while the high street struggles, Amazon\u2019s sales are booming. Amazon now accounts for one in every four pounds spent on physical entertainment products by UK shoppers. In the same quarter last year the US giant accounted for 22% of spend. Fellow US giant eBay has also significantly increased its market share, from 4% to 5.8% year-on-year. \u201cAmazon and eBay are increasingly popular with shoppers wanting to get the latest release without leaving their homes, particularly if a traditional retailer has disappeared from their local high street,\u201d said Claire McClelland, consumer specialist at Kantar. In the video market, primarily DVDs, sales plunged 28% \u2013 about \u00a331m \u2013 from \u00a3111.5m to \u00a380.7m. Kantar said the tough comparison against blockbuster sales of hit film The Greatest Showman were to blame for \u00a322m of the fall. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of competition out there for DVD retailers, particularly in the form of online streaming services,\u201d said McClelland. \u201cNo longer just for young people, older generations are becoming increasingly tech-savvy and more confident at using these platforms and they are buying DVDs less often as a result.\u201d Sales of CDs fell 11% in the quarter from \u00a380m to \u00a371m, partly due to a lack of \u201cbig name\u201d music releases and exacerbated by the HMV store closures. Video game sales fell 14% to \u00a362m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
