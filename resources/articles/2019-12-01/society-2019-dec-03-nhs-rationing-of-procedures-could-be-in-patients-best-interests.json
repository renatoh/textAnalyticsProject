The examples he cites where restrictions will be introduced are a list of non-evidence-based practices which either do not help (at best) or actively harm (at worst). Over-investigation and over-treatment of patients is a real and present problem, as the newly elected chair of Royal College of General Practitioners Council, Prof Martin Marshall, said in his first public statement, reported in your pages on 27 November. It is unethical both to expose patients to unsafe practice and to use NHS resources funding procedures for which there is no evidence. Dr Helen Lucas GP, London \u2022 Rationed or rational? The paramount duty of doctors is to do no harm. The quoted examples of tests and procedures all have the potential to cause harm. Diagnostic x-rays have a quantifiable risk of causing cancer. Arthroscopies and hernia operations involve general anaesthetics, which can have rare complications including death, particularly in the age group most likely to be affected. Targeting prostate blood tests results in the same mortality from cancer as universal screening or non-targeted testing but the latter approaches have a greater morbidity both physically and psychologically. None of this is new \u2013 guidelines based on research have been in place for years as noted by Prof Carrie MacEwen in your report. I am sure the Patients Association would agree that any such proposals should be used by professionals to have informed discussions with patients before embarking on investigations or procedures that either lack an evidence base for benefit or may cause harm. I am delighted this was front page news but shouldn\u2019t it have been a \u201cgood\u201d news story that the wellbeing of patients, both those directly affected by such \u201crationing\u201d and the wider population whose scarce NHS resources are being used to fund these tests and procedures, is the primary consideration? Oh, by the way, my 94-year-old father is more than happy to live with his hernia \u2013 after informed discussion with his specialist. Dr Robin Davy Altrincham, Cheshire \u2022 Who would argue that the appropriate use of antibiotics is rationing? Restricting the use of NHS tests that are of no benefit, waste money and may cause harm is not rationing. Gerald Maguire Great Shelford, Cambridgeshire \u2022 In January a collapse from pain after eating and attendance by paramedics caused me to request an appointment with my NHS vascular surgeon to check my abdominal stent. In August I saw this surgeon and had a CT scan. This showed gallstones and I was referred to a specialist, being told: \u201cI don\u2019t know when you will get an appointment.\u201d No appointment has yet been offered but continual pain after eating caused me to eat less and less. Last Saturday, a visit from a GP was followed by a request for an ambulance. This arrived after 17 hours. The A&amp;E result was that nothing could be done as there was no emergency, ie the gall bladder was not inflamed or burst. I was sent home and referred back to my GP and, on asking how I could live without eating, was told to slowly \u201cbuild up\u201d from liquids to soft food and take painkillers. I am not blaming the NHS at all \u2013 it has saved my life on four previous occasions. I am a leftwinger and have constantly campaigned against this government. I am partially disabled and have had diabetes type 1 controlled for 60 very full years. I am a writer, or was, until this pain stopped me. This Monday I took out a loan and booked an appointment in a private hospital. I am lucky to be able to afford to do this \u2013 millions cannot. I regret I have to put money into the pockets of shareholders of a private hospital but what else can I do? More importantly, what can the millions do who can\u2019t afford this \u2013 die?
