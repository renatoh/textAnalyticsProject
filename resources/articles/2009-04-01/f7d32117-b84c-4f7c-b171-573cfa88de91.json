The Arsenal manager watched his team suffer a 2-1 defeat against Chelsea in Saturday's FA Cup semi-final on the once hallowed turf and, though he said that the uneven playing surface was not the reason for the defeat, he condemned it in the strongest terms. \"Don't get me wrong, I don't think we have lost because of the pitch, but it's really embarrassing,\" the Frenchman said. \"When you see what this stadium has cost and you cannot turn up with a proper football pitch ... somebody must give explanations about that.\" The FA has overseen the turf being relayed five times since the stadium opened in 2007 and the most recent attempt in January, a rye compound featuring a synthetic element which is meant to help \"bedding in\", will remain in place for the FA Cup final on 30 May. A sixth re\u2011lay will take place after the summer season of concerts. Wenger, though, said the problem was not that the turf cut up but rather that the pitch itself was \"not flat\". \"When you build a stadium with that kind of money and you still have not a pitch, it's laughable,\" he added. \"The quality of the pitch is a disaster. I just think it's not a pitch.\" The FA hoped the original turf would last and earn plaudits but it has claimed that the concerts that are part of the Wembley business plan made that impossible. However, Wenger said: \"I'm not sure that the pop concerts are the reason because this pitch was never good.\" Fabio Capello, the England manager, has skirted around the issue but Wenger was not the only voice of dissent over the weekend. \"It's not an excuse, you can't blame the pitch but it didn't really help,\" the Arsenal striker Robin van Persie said. \"If you compare this pitch to the one at the Emirates, there's a big difference because when you get the ball [at Wembley], it's just bouncing and bouncing and bouncing. You really need to focus on where it first comes from and, at the Emirates, it's just smooth. \"We had the same problem in Holland with the Ajax Stadium when it was new, a few years ago,\" continued the Dutchman. \"It was so bad, they changed the pitch every two weeks.\" The Chelsea manager, Guus Hiddink, though, played down the concerns. \"The pitch was good to play. I don't want to make a lot of comments about this,\" he said. \"If you go to a lot of places in Europe and Africa you get pitches that are a lot worse than that. I don't think you should start talking about the pitch, whether you win or lose.\" Sir Alex Ferguson, however, insisted he withdrew Paul Scholes, Berbatov and Patrice Evra from the starting line-up because of the state of the Wembley pitch. \"Yesterday [in the first semi-final] it looked spongy and dead and difficult to move the ball quickly around it,\" the United manager said. \"They've got all these lights around the perimeter to help the growth and the standard of the soil. But it looks dead to me. \"Once we made our mind up [to play the younger players] I was quite enthusiastic about it. It was the right thing to do. It was good for them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
