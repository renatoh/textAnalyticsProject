This seasonal institution was founded in 1969 in the confident belief that TV was our lingua franca and the nation would join together at Christmas in a diasporic community assembled in 20m living rooms. In those days every sitcom or quiz show, however secular and unenchanted, had its own Christmas show. I would trawl the Aladdin's cave of TV listings in search of any old rubbish with a festive theme, from Val Doonican in a reindeer jumper to Christmas Celebrity Squares. The routinely cited apex of this golden age, as Ian Jack recently mentioned in the Guardian, was the 1977 Morecambe &amp; Wise Christmas special \u2013 which, according to the Guinness Book of Records, saw 28.5 million viewers delight in Eric and Ernie and various BBC presenters performing There Is Nothing Like a Dame, from South Pacific. There is a long tradition, running from William Langland to TS Eliot, which supposes that Britain once possessed an organic common culture that has been fragmented by modernity. This is the televisual version of the myth: a lament for the lost capacity of TV to create shared moments. History is rarely so neat. Ratings in the 1970s were fiercely disputed. The figure of 28.5 million Morecambe &amp; Wise viewers came from the BBC's audience research. ITV's figures, which the British Film Institute now prefers, suggests that 1977 Christmas special was only the 11th most viewed programme of the 1970s, with 21.3 million viewers, while the Mike Yarwood Christmas Show that preceded it on BBC1 had 21.4 million. So perhaps Morecambe &amp; Wise actually made 100,000 turn off or switch over. People want to believe there was a moment when the nation congregated around the TV, and this yearning for community runs counter to the market logic of the last three decades. Ever since the Annan report in 1977, the received wisdom of government has been that broadcasters are an unelected elite imposing their vision of the world on the rest of us. Thatcherism championed the notion of consumer choice against this BBC-ITV duopoly. The irony is that in the market-led environment created by the 1990 Broadcasting Act, those who watched TV the most \u2013 old people \u2013 were the most ignored because they were least appealing to advertisers. With the rise of digital and catch-up TV in the 2000s, the era of \"linear viewing\" was supposed to end. We could now personalise an evening's TV like atomised individual consumers. Only it hasn't happened. Saturday night event-TV like the X Factor and Strictly Come Dancing has revived the concept of live shows watched by families. True, the viewing figures are smaller than in the 1970s, but the potential for collective involvement is greater. Twitter has allowed vast virtual communities to discuss shows while they are being broadcast. There is also far more discussion of popular culture in serious newspapers; people who have never seen the X Factor know more than they would like. Such shows revive Dennis Potter's vision of TV as a mass democratic form that could break through the intellectual and class hierarchies of theatre and print culture. One of the defining qualities of TV remains that it can be viewed by lots of people at the same time. Over the next few days it will once again create this ephemeral, undemanding form of togetherness as millions watch the Doctor Who Christmas Special, the new version of Upstairs, Downstairs, and the Top Gear team driving to Bethlehem. Even as our politicians continue to recite the mantra of individual choice, the continued popularity of Christmas telly points to this longing for a collective life."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
