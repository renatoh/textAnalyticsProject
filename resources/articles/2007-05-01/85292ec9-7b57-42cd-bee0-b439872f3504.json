That is the absurdity thrown up by an Old Bailey ruling on Thursday, in the case of a civil servant and an MP's researcher who were convicted for disclosing minutes of a meeting between Tony Blair and George Bush. Allegations based on these papers made headlines round the world. Mr Justice Aikens knows full well that the horse has long since bolted and that closing the door is futile, yet in an eccentric move he still made a point of trying to push it half shut. He ruled that these claims could be reported, but only in articles not referring to the document. We can neither confirm nor deny whether these claims are referred to in other pages of the Guardian. Two decades ago, with the Spycatcher case, the judges eventually ruled against censoring material freely available overseas. The new ruling, however, suppresses material already available not only abroad but also at home. Even if the aim is to spare American blushes, the ruling hardly makes sense when the allegations are already public knowledge in the US. One specific allegation - that Mr Bush was considering bombing the Arabic TV channel al-Jazeera - is exempt from the censorship, an extra hole in the gag that only underlines its futility. The senseless attempt at censorship is only one of the concerns with a case in which the attorney general is said to have taken a close personal interest. Another is the six-month sentence imposed on David Keogh, the official who obtained the document - the same as that imposed on the former spy David Shayler, who, unlike Mr Keogh, leaked multiple documents and profited by doing so. When even the judge conceded that Mr Keogh's leak had caused \"no actual damage\" the punishment is far too harsh. After all, Mr Keogh could argue - in a defence already employed this week - that he was only doing what he thought was right. National security requires that there are rules to stop some information becoming public. But these should be defined narrowly and applied proportionately, or serious risks arise. The insistence during the trial of the prime minister's foreign-policy adviser that confidential papers must remain so even when they document illegality or abhorrent immorality hardly fits with that. It was no libertarian but Lord Walker - the judge who in 2004 dissented from colleagues to support detention without trial - who observed that \"whether or not patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel, national security can be the last refuge of the tyrant\". The sorry aftermath this week of this Whitehall leak gives new poignancy to his warning. Pending appeals against both the sentences and gagging orders surely deserve to succeed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
