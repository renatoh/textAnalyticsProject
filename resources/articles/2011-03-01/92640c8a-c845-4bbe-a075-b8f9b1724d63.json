Fahey might deny that any rivalry exists between himself and Mark Johnston but in claiming the crown, he is on an inevitable collision course with the man who has come to dominate the famous Yorkshire racing town of Middleham as much as Fahey has in Malton. With the recent completion of the first phase in a multi-million pound redevelopment programme, Fahey now has 202 boxes to fill at Musley Bank stables, a stone's throw from the busy dual carriageway of the A64 which links Scarborough to the A1 via York. This year will see the building of new accommodation for staff, followed by the demolition of other older stables and the building of four new blocks. \"My father was an engineer and I was bought up building roads and houses,\" he said on Monday. \"Maybe if you were a psychologist you would say that was the issue but the thing is that I can't bear to be standing still. Got to kick on, keep moving forward. If you stand still, you go backwards. \"I want this place to be the number one stable in the north, I want owners to be impressed and for everything to have the 'wow factor'. We don't do badly for owners, thankfully, and once they're here, they tend not to go away which is important, but you can't ever rest on your laurels.\" When broadcaster Nick Luck described Fahey as \"the king of the northern trainers\", an innocuous comment drew an understandably robust response from Johnston and his cohorts in his always-readable newsletter, the Kingsley Klarion. Fahey tried, slightly unsuccessfully, to keep away from fanning the flames. \"Mark and I are friends,\" he said. \"There's no rivalry, just a bit of competition. I look occasionally in the papers to see where we are in the tables \u2026 well, all right, I look every day. We had 66 winners in Yorkshire last year and that's a lot. When we did it before, I think we did it with 35. \"We'll have more winners this year than last year. I'll tell you that all right, because we're well ahead of how many we'd had on the all-weather this time last year. We've got to keep having them though. I owe the bank manager millions now. I've taken the gamble and we need to keep the winners coming.\" Chief among those he hopes will contribute to the tally is unbeaten colt Wootton Bassett, the horse who gave Fahey and champion jockey Paul Hanagan their first Group One success when taking the Prix Jean-Luc Lagadere at Longchamp on Arc weekend last year. Despite a setback which saw him miss three weeks' work earlier this year, Fahey now reports Wootton Bassett to be a certain runner in the 2,000 Guineas, although he will not have a prep-race. \"We won't have time for that, unfortunately, but we will take him for a gallop somewhere,\" he said. \"The plan was to take him to Newmarket but I'm not sure about that. We'll have to see how he is coming along. Doncaster, or Thirsk or Pontefract, or somewhere like that might be more likely.\" Not that, with Frankel in opposition, he expects Wootton Bassett to face anything other than a stiff task. \"I'm frightened of him, of course I am,\" he said. \"I wouldn't swap my fellow but I'd love the pair of them. It's a bit different when Henry Cecil says he thinks he's about the best horse he's trained to when I say it. Put it this way \u2013 I'd love to see him go to Newbury and get beat.\" Fahey plays down his chances of repeating the four winners he and Hanagan managed on Saturday 12 months ago at Doncaster at the weekend, victories which carved out a lead in the jockeys' title race that Hanagan clung on to for the rest of the campaign. \"We had a good year and we've got some poorly handicapped horses as a result, but there are 80 two-year-olds and hopefully there'd be a nice one or two among them,\" said the trainer, who could run three, four or more in the Lincoln from the 15 he entered for the race. \"It's tricky to say until we know what the ground will be like. Some obviously won't get in and could run in the consolation race, the Spring Mile.\" Hanagan's mount is likely to be Irish Heartbeat, who won the Spring Mile 12 months ago, while Lee Topliss is set to ride Prime Exhibit and George Challoner is pencilled in for the mount on Harrison George."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
