With comments that will raise a few eyebrows at Anfield, the forward made it clear that he is not happy out wide, which is where he started in the Premier League defeat against Burnley last Saturday, and said \u201ceveryone knows my best position\u201d. Sturridge was speaking after he came off the substitutes\u2019 bench to score twice in a 5-0 win against Burton Albion in the EFL Cup second round on Tuesday, when Divock Origi was given the opportunity to start up front. The Belgian scored Liverpool\u2019s opening goal in a comfortable victory and would appear to be the biggest threat to Sturridge\u2019s hopes of playing through the middle as an out-and-out striker this season. At Turf Moor Sturridge found himself wide on the right and struggled to make much impression on an afternoon when Liverpool toiled and lost 2-0 against Sean Dyche\u2019s side. The England international gave the impression that he never feels comfortable in that sort of position, whereas he said that as a No9 everything comes so naturally to him that it feels as though he is \u201con autopilot\u201d. \u201cOf course it is more difficult for me to play wide. I\u2019m a centre-forward,\u201d said Sturridge, who claimed that the thinking behind using him on the right at Burnley was not explained to him. \u201cIn the modern day game you have to try and be flexible but everyone knows my best position. \u201cEveryone knows where I enjoy playing the most. I\u2019m a player who plays on instinct, and in the middle I have clarity on movements and things that I have been doing for years. I am on autopilot there. You just do things because you are used to doing it. But when you are out wide, you have got to worry about different things. It\u2019s just a different way. The way you move, the way you play \u2013 it is all different. You can\u2019t play the same as you do as a centre-forward.\u201d Asked whether he was happy playing out wide, Sturridge replied: \u201cWell, I have to do a job for the team. That\u2019s not saying I am happy to do it. That\u2019s saying I have got to do a job for the team. It\u2019s a team game. If I am put in that position, I have to play there.\u201d With Sadio Man\u00e9, who was outstanding against Burton, Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino, Georginio Wijnaldum and Adam Lallana, Klopp is not short of attacking options across a range of positions, although Origi and Sturridge are the only recognised centre-forwards. It will be interesting to see how the Liverpool manager sets his team up at Tottenham on Saturday and whether Sturridge\u2019s comments colour his thinking. Sturridge has featured on the wing for his previous club, Chelsea, and his country in the past, including at the European Championship finals in the summer, and it remains to be seen what plans Sam Allardyce has for a player who is almost certain to be named in his England squad for next month\u2019s World Cup qualifier against Slovakia. \u201cHopefully I will be in there, it would be nice to be,\u201d Sturridge said. \u201cIt is a different regime, a different coaching style. I\u2019ve never worked with Sam or [his assistant] Sammy Lee, so I don\u2019t really know how they work. But if I am in the squad, it will be a good occasion and we are looking to bounce back from the Euros. We want to start the campaign with a win.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
