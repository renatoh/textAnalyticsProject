The Australia, who gained worldwide fame in 2015 as the first woman to ride a Melbourne Cup winner, had reported herself as feeling ill since shortly after arriving in Britain on Wednesday. She tweeted: \u201c Devastated I\u2019m not well enough to compete in the Dubai Duty Free Shergar Cup. Medical advice is a 5 day recovery. Had been a massive goal.\u201d \u201cIt is with great disappointment that because of a virus I have contracted since arriving in England, I find I am unable to ride in the Shergar Cup competition today,\u201d Payne said in a statement released by Ascot racecourse. \u201cI saw the doctor yesterday and we had both hoped the medication prescribed would kick in, but unfortunately that has not been the case and I am not well enough to compete today. \u201cI had been looking forward to being part of this special event for a long time. Joining the girls\u2019 team had been had been a major goal of mine over the last 12 months, since missing the opportunity due to injuries sustained in a fall last year. I would like to thank everyone for their support and encouragement and would love to return another time.\u201d Newbury racegoers may still get a chance to see Payne in action next Saturday, when she is expected to ride Kaspersky in the Summer Mile. She rode the horse to be fifth at big odds in a Group One at Royal Ascot this summer. Today\u2019s ITV4 races, by Chris Cook Anthony Delpech, who recently became South Africa\u2019s champion jockey for the third time at the age of 48, could prove the star of this Shergar Cup and has live chances in both the last two races at Ascot. The pick of his five mounts is Lualiwa (4.00), who has an excellent chance in the Sprint race that closes the novelty card. While this counts as a very belated British debut for Delpech, he has racked up vast experience at home and in Hong Kong, where Vengeance Of Rain was among the winners he rode. Nothing in these six handicaps would match that one for class but Lualiwa is at least progressive, having won his last two for the resurgent trainer, Kevin Ryan. Versatile as to ground, Lualiwa was last seen making all the running at York under the apprentice Lewis Edmunds. An extra 6lb should not stop him. 1.05 Ascot: Stake Acclaim did not cope as well as his stablemate, Lancelot Du Lac, with a poor draw in last weekend\u2019s Stewards\u2019 Cup. But he had been in fine form before that and may be seen to better effect in this much more winnable heat, with Jamie Spencer up. 1.40 Ascot: Some cut in the ground seems to help Swashbuckle, whose defeat of Sternrubin at Salisbury looks like good form in this context. His jockey is Neil Callan, who used to be one of the busiest jockeys in Britain but is based in Hong Kong these days. 1.55 Haydock: Having broken a long losing run last time, Dance King still looks handily treated and might now be one to stick with. 2.15 Ascot: Hayley Turner has landed a right chance in Mukhayyam, who comes here as the winner of his last two. Tim Easterby\u2019s charge is almost back to his peak rating but has been finishing as though there is more to come. 2.30 Haydock: Unbeaten in three, Laraib is the sexy one here but this is a significant step up in class from handicaps. The relatively late-blooming Autocratic might be a better bet at a bigger price, for all that the form of his Brigadier Gerard success has not worked out brilliantly. 2.50 Ascot: Michelle Payne\u2019s best chance comes aboard Early Morning, a winner under Turner at the last Shergar Cup. The grey can be forgiven his Royal Ascot flop, as he seems to do better in smaller fields. 3.25 Ascot: Delpech gets the leg-up on an interesting outsider in the Classic. Glenys The Menace bumped into a good one when held by Time Chaser at Sandown on Thursday but had won her previous two. 3.40 Newmarket: Silvestre de Sousa is an interesting booking for Richard Fahey\u2019s extra-speedy Dance Diva, whose unbeaten run was halted only by the extremely good Nyaleti. She can pay a compliment to that rival by landing this Sweet Solera.
