Of course I don't have one of Lucie Rie's exquisite bowls - ceramics by famous names don't come much cheaper than paintings by famous artists. But I do have shelves full of vessels that I love, yet which haven't made a dent in my savings. And that is one of the pleasures of ceramics: you don't have to be a Saatchi to collect them. We are all collectors already. The plates we eat off, the vases we put our flowers in are all examples of this art. It's accessibility is part of the joy. The high street is filled with fantastic ceramics: Ikea has a wonderful stoneware range; Habitat has tableware which looks handmade, selling for factory-style prices; and even Woolworths, temple of cheap, has a beautifully simple vase for only \u00a35.99. The abundance of good, low-priced, mass-produced ware is exciting in itself. But it also seems to have raised our interest in handmade work, too. The contemporary market is booming and this where ceramics get exciting, and not just in the London galleries. \"Local potters shouldn't be overlooked,\" says Emmanuel Cooper, potter and editor of Ceramic Review. \"They might not be famous, but fame shouldn't be an issue anyway. When we buy, it should be because we have fallen in love.\" Buying an original If the piece you have fallen for is going to cost serious money, you need some solid, reassuring information. Gallery owners are good for background information. If you're concerned about the piece retaining or increasing its value,go for a big name: in the world of domestic ceramics, names don't get much bigger than Julian Stair, Edmund de Waal and Walter Keeler. These potters command big prices (at a recent show, a porcelain caddy by Julian Stair went for \u00a31,200; even the smallest Edmund de Waal vessel starts at around \u00a3400). But the name-obsessed can satisfy themselves more cheaply if they go for something functional: a salt-glaze jug by Walter Keeler can be bought for \u00a3105, which is a bargain for something handmade by a potter of his calibre; and a mug by Richard Batterham (another famous name) can be picked up for under \u00a310. So where do you find these people? The Crafts Council (020-7278 7700) is a great place to start: it has a huge list of both established and new members nationwide. Arm yourself with one of its two publications: the free Crafts Guide, for craft shops and galleries nationwide, or the Crafts Gallery Guide, which costs \u00a315.99, but has more detail. Potters, a directory of members of the Craft Potters Association, is also worth having. Published by the Ceramic Review, you can order it on 020-7439 3377 (\u00a312.95, plus \u00a32 p&amp;p). Up-and-coming artists These days, being a potter is a most fashionable occupation, which means there are stacks of fledgling artists desperate to find an audience. Cockpit Arts is a group of around 100 artists, a quarter of whom are ceramicists. You can't just turn up to their studios, but they do hold two annual open events in June and November (there's one this weekend in fact) where people can both buy and place commissions. MA degree shows (the Royal College of Art is probably the best known) are also good places to find new talent. Visit www.studiopottery.co.uk, which has a list of shows (plus exhibitions, galleries and events) or, if you're not on the web, get the On Course handbook (\u00a31.95 from bookshops) for a list of every further education establishment in the country. At the other end of the scale, there are the galleries such as Contemporary Applied Arts (020-7436 2344, www.caa.org.uk), which stocks work by many of the country's leading makers. Don't be put off by its bleached-white gorgeousness: this place is stuffed with the best ceramics (and other applied art) and isn't snooty. The staff are friendly and keen to help you find the right piece. The art of display If you're sensible, you will have considered display beforehand and selected the size, shape and colour of your vessel accordingly; but if, like me, you buy on impulse when the love thing strikes, then you won't have given a thought to where it will go. Fortunately, domestic ceramics can pretty much jostle in anywhere. Yet, displayed creatively, even a Woolworths bargain can make a real impact. Annabel Freyberg, in her book Ceramics For The Home (Laurence King, \u00a330), recommends grouping work by colour or object type to turn individual pieces into a striking collection. This is particularly effective if your ceramics are not that fine. She also suggests playing with scale. \"Large jars in a small room look unexpectedly grand,\" she writes, \"while lining up exquisite tea bowls on a tall, heavy mantelpiece emphasises their delicacy.\" Free-standing block shelves that take a single piece are a good idea (and look great as a group), as are box-shelves, which turn pots into framed works of art. Other suitable places are the tops of wardrobes, windowsills (especially for ceramics with strong profiles, great lit from behind) and even the floor. But don't imprison works in a glass cabinet. Ceramics are made to be handled. Bowls need to kept low to see the insides, while plates, mugs and vessels should be no higher than eye level. And functional pieces need to be placed where they can be used. Yes, a Walter Keeler \u00a352 mug is precious, but it is a mug and was made to be drunk from: confine it to a high shelf and you deny yourself half its pleasure.
