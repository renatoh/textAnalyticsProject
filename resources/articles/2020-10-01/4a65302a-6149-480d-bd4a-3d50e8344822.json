Odsonne \u00c9douard, Celtic\u2019s leading striker, arrived back in Glasgow only on Friday after testing positive for Covid-19 more than a week ago with France\u2019s Under-21s. Nir Bitton and Hatem Elhamed will miss Rangers\u2019 visit after they returned positive tests in the Israel camp. Ryan Christie has also been absent from Celtic\u2019s training ground, having been identified as a close contact of Stuart Armstrong, the Southampton midfielder who was confirmed as positive for coronavirus with Scotland. Rangers appear unaffected by Covid matters for this game. Bookmakers are finding it tough to separate the chances of the teams, despite Celtic\u2019s recent domestic dominance. \u201cWe just carry on as normal,\u201d Lennon said. \u201cOur preparations have been good, as best as we possibly could get them under the circumstances. We only got everyone back as a group today [on Friday]. \u201cI take no notice of what people will predict or what they think the outcome will be, because it doesn\u2019t really matter. They don\u2019t know what is going on or how we\u2019ve prepared for the game. I\u2019m delighted if they want to write us off \u2013 they\u2019ve done that many times before.\u201d Celtic face their oldest foes a point adrift at the summit of the Scottish Premiership with a game in hand. \u201cI think it gives you a psychological lift if you can win the first one but I don\u2019t think it will have a major bearing on the outcome of the season,\u201d Celtic\u2019s manager said. \u201cIt\u2019s too early for that. We heard all that chat at the end of December [after Rangers won at Celtic Park] that we were finished. We came out all guns blazing in the second half of the season. \u201cWhat I am pleased with is our consistency, the win ratio, the clean sheets. I think there\u2019s more to come from the team and more to come from individuals as well as we go along. It\u2019s been quite a stop-start this season in terms of games being cancelled and international breaks. So it\u2019s been difficult to get any sort of momentum going. But we\u2019ve negotiated those circumstances very well of late.\u201d Lennon, so immersed in this fixture, admits it will be very odd without spectators. He retains \u201cmajor concern\u201d about the long-term absence of fans from Scottish grounds. \u201cOnce the kick-off comes, your focus is on the game itself, just as it always is. Yes, there will be part of me which thinks: \u2018God, this just doesn\u2019t feel right.\u2019 But you have to get past that very quickly. It\u2019s certainly not ideal and it does take away the home advantage, there\u2019s no question about that. \u201cI still believe that spectators could and should be coming to the matches but that\u2019s the government\u2019s decision to make, not mine. I look around Europe and, when Finland played the Republic of Ireland, they had 7,000 in their stadium. Just to have that kind of figure would be good.\u201d Steven Gerrard has shrugged off any notion that international matches provide needless risk in the midst of the pandemic. \u201cAssuming that players can be safe, I want international football to continue,\u201d the Rangers manager said. \u201cWe know it\u2019s not perfect, but two weeks ago we had a fantastic highlight qualifying for the Europa League against Galatasaray, so I can\u2019t sit here and say European and international football should be cancelled because it might suit my Rangers team.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
