The manager dropped Hart as the No1 in pre-season and allowed him be loaned to Torino until the end of the season. Guardiola bought Bravo from Barcelona to be Hart\u2019s replacement but Caballero has superseded him after the Chilean recently lost his place. Hart is due to return to City in the summer although Guardiola, when asked if the England goalkeeper might have a long-term future at the club, said: \u201cI\u2019m so happy with Willy and Claudio. We are going to talk about it [Hart\u2019s future] at the end of the season.\u201d Caballero has started every match since late January apart from the goalless draw at Huddersfield in the FA Cup fifth round. In the lead\u2011up to the replay on Wednesday night Guardiola was asked if he might recruit a new goalkeeper in the next transfer window. \u201cI will decide about that at the end of the season. I trust a lot in both and we\u2019ll decide \u2013 not just the goalkeepers, the midfielders, wingers, strikers, full-backs \u2013 we are going to decide at the end of the season,\u201d said the Catalan, who admitted he could start next season with only Bravo and Caballero. \u201cYes.\u201d Caballero, who was signed by Manuel Pellegrini in 2011 from M\u00e1laga, is out of contract in June along with Jes\u00fas Navas, Yaya Tour\u00e9, Ga\u00ebl Clichy, Pablo Zabaleta and Bacary Sagna. \u201cWe\u2019ll make a decision at the end of the season,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cThey [players out of contract] have to try to keep going, to convince me every day. There are five, six players out of contract but they know the situation. Of course there is a risk, maybe they can sign a contract for another club and we have to accept that. But we are going to decide in the last months of the season.\u201d Guardiola is still to decide which keeper will face David Wagner\u2019s team at the Etihad Stadium. \u201cI have to think about it, not just with our goalkeepers. We were one week out. It is not how tired they are, more a final against one team who impressed a lot when we played there. They are [near the] top of the Championship and sometimes teams top of the Champ are stronger than some of the teams in the Premier League.\u201d City returned from a four-day trip to Abu Dhabi on Saturday. There Guardiola met Sheikh Mansour, the owner, for the first time. The head coach signed a three-year deal when taking over last summer but the proprietor wants him to stay longer. \u201cHe knows and I know that it all depends on the results,\u201d the 45-year-old said. \u201cHe would like that I stay here for a long, long, long, long time. But of course it depends on the results. If not, they would say what happened, what can we do. What we need to improve, to improve. That\u2019s the process \u2013 to finish the process they are going to help us. \u201cI had a good relations with almost all my owners in Barcelona and Bayern Munich [former clubs] \u2013 it is important to know them. We are here because of the results. If the results are not good we are replaced. We are together, both departments, the chairman and managers, we have the same target, so the people can be proud of us.\u201d Guardiola has not been given any specific material goals. \u201cWe didn\u2019t speak about that,\u201d he said. \u2018They will be happy if we win. I know we have to win but I\u2019ve handled that in the past and I will in the present. We spoke about private lives, families, the club. What\u2019s my impression after six months, half a year here. They are able to help us, not just me but the people at the club, the staff. They were so kind.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
