Until a decade or so ago, the hour-long rage-fest was the party's annual X-certificate moment. A pumped-up session full of calls by delegates for hanging and corporal punishment provided a high-risk yearly ordeal for Tory home secretaries. Some of them loathed it. Others loved it. None could ignore it. Tuesday afternoon's session in Birmingham showed the scale of the change. The same hall that had been packed for the Boris Johnson show earlier in the day was now half full. The home secretary made a speech, followed by the police minister and the justice secretary. All were politely applauded. No one spoke from the floor, because floor speeches are no longer allowed. The atmosphere was flat. And that was that. Well, almost. Some things haven't changed. Twenty years after Tony Blair led Labour on to law and order territory, the Tories still regard home affairs as their issue, not Labour's. Like so many of their predecessors, Theresa May and Chris Grayling therefore came to the conference hall armed with combative rhetoric and new announcements: Mrs May with the news that victims of antisocial behaviour will be able to choose the form of community punishment imposed on the offender, Mr Grayling with his well-trailed tougher community sentences and his permission to \"batter a burglar\" (as the Sun's front page put it), as well as yet another extension of life sentences. Yet neither of the ministers' speeches should be dismissed as an echo of the past. Kenneth Clarke may have been replaced by a man who wants to be known as a tough justice minister \u2013 though when did anyone promise to be a weak one? \u2013 but Mr Grayling's comments on the need to break the cycle of deprivation, disadvantage and reoffending could have been delivered by the most liberal of penal reformers. Meanwhile, Mrs May's insistence on the necessity of police reform was a welcome contrast with Labour's taste for opportunist slipstreaming behind the police unions. This is not to give the two speeches or coalition priorities a free pass. Both Labour and the Tories are overly fond of irrelevant tough gestures \u2013 like violence against burglars \u2013 at the expense of effective social and criminal justice policies. The coalition nevertheless deserves credit for taking aspects of police and penal reform more seriously than previous governments have done. The fact that reform is largely being driven by cost rather than conviction remains secondary to the encouraging fact that some much-needed things are being done at all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
