Just under 60 seconds after coming on as a substitute for only his second senior Ipswich game, the 18-year-old Darren Bent gave his team a lingering chance of Premiership survival last night. At best it was his outstretched knee which directed the ball into the Middlesbrough net, although there was a strong suspicion that Franck Queudrue actually was the culprit and that it was an own-goal. No matter, it was the kind of moment for which Ipswich have prayed in vain for weeks now. It may be too late but it leaves them with a grandstand finish against Manchester United and Liverpool in their last two games. Ipswich should have been home and hosed, though, within the first 26 minutes as they put Operation Great Escape in action. The two Marcuses, Stewart and Bent, set the tone only for Bent to undergo a serious rush of blood at just the wrong moment. Although the shot was blazed wastefully over, the incident lit the touchpaper for the rowdy home support. Sixto Peralta followed the marker laid down, surging forward on a foraging run until crudely bundled over by the Scotland striker Allan Johnston. Martijn Reuser took the free-kick and shivered the timbers of Mark Schwarzer's bar as his shot skimmed along the roof of the net. At this stage Boro were playing in a gentle, end-of-term fashion which seemed to suggest that they were yearning for the summer holidays. If their neighbours in Sunderland, the nearest club in Ipswich's sights, five points away in fourth bottom, could have seen them harsh words would have been exchanged. In fact it was not hard to imagine Peter Reid and his chairman Bob Gray sitting by a radio chewing their nails nervously. Stewart might have caused them to bite a finger clean off if he had taken the gilt-edged chance offered by Marcus Bent in the 25th minute. His co-striker pushed a tempting little pass into Stewart's path and, as a fair, old-fashioned shoulder charge left Colin Cooper sprawling, the man who was not so long ago being talked of as a wild-card selection for the World Cup missed an absolute sitter. One on one with Schwarzer he clipped the ball wide of the right-hand post, but not until the ball actually hit the advertising hoardings was it possible to believe he had actually failed to score. That would have been particularly harsh on poor Cooper, who was playing for Middlesbrough for the first time since his young son Finlay choked to death on a toy in January. Within a minute of Stewart's failure to score Reuser had added to the growing feeling that this match was going to be no gift-wrapped Ipswich win. The Dutchman stooped low enough to head up and over the bar from Titus Bramble's cross when he really should have converted. Eventually his manager put Stewart out of his misery by calling him to the bench and suddenly Ipswich could dream of Premiership survival again when his replacement found the net. It was a Keystone Kops-style goal, all flailing arms and bodies colliding, but it counted. Young Bent ran around roaring like a lion and George Burley leapt up and down. Not to be outdone, Alun Armstrong, who had come on with Bent, finished off the best move of the match with a firm header against the Boro post in the 69th minute. But it was not the killer second goal and Ipswich were not rid of their agonising wait. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
