Having been warned of the rat-like cunning and sheer viciousness of the British media, he found himself yesterday morning wading through the bath of warm syrup that is Breakfast With Frost. Here his chief problem, which must have been especially taxing for one who did not grow up with The Frost Report and That Was The Week That Was, was not avoiding ambushes, but working out what the heck it was that Frost was saying. As has been cleverly observed by Rory Bremner and others, the more celebrated Frost has become, the less necessary he has found it to articulate actual complete words. Sometimes the endings trail off into the ether, sometimes the middles are replaced with a non-specific grunt, and when he really hits his stride entire words are inclined to go awol. So it was that Frostie yesterday asked the new England boss: \"Whe the plays get togeth, wi, er, be stric roos abow alhol?\" After only a slight delay while he dealt with the double translation needed - into English, and then into his native tongue - Eriksson, magically, was able to come up with a response. His ability to construct something meaningful from only the scantiest of evidence was impressive, and fills you with hope that those midweek visits to Pride Park and the Stadium of Light may not have been a waste of time after all. His answer was that the squad might as well get used to Perrier water. \"I don't know about strict rules,\" said Eriksson, \"But we are together for playing for England, not for other things.\" Sven delivered his message with a smile, but there is something about his face when he smiles - it is probably those glasses - that reminds you of Erich von Stroheim and Max von Sydow and all those other Vons that Hollywood wheels out to play U-boat commanders. I certainly would not want to be caught with liqueur chocolates in my kit bag with Sven in charge of the ship. \"Wi Enland plays ha to be tee-tollers?\" Frostie asked. \"Look, I am a Swede, I am used to alcohol myself,\" replied Eriksson, although possibly not as used to it as you, he might have added but didn't. \"But these are professional footballers and you expect them to behave professionally, especially if they are playing for England.\" It was Eriksson's first major television interview, and provided sound-bites for Five Live's sports bulletins for the rest of the morning, illustrating the great strength of Sir David. He is such a powerful networker that he does manage to secure the top people for his show. They are also liable to relax their guard in the face of Frostie's honeyed part-words, although I am not sure Sven revealed a great deal, apart from the fact that Beckham will be in his squad, and he will choose his players first before fixing on tactics, although he expects to play with a back four. The nation's football fans will have been heartened by Sven's apparent seriousness of purpose. He did not seem at all out of place on Frostie's show alongside Lord Wakeham and the Israeli politician Binyamin Netanyahu, although we will want to see him with Robbie Williams and Razor Ruddock on Sky's Soccer AM before we are convinced he is one of us. If you are looking for a suitable analogy for the job that now confronts Eriksson, how about The Race, a non-stop, no-holds-barred contest between six massive catamarans aiming to circumnavigate the world in around 65 days. \"Most people say it's fantastic, but impossible,\" said the yachtsman Bruno Peyron, who came up with the idea of The Race. Sven may soon be able to empathise. Like international football managers, the skippers of these huge craft must learn to deal with periods of calm followed by bursts of feverish activity, during which if you are not careful your sail will be torn to shreds, or your lovingly constructed vessel might even fall to bits altogether. One of the boats has already dropped out of the event, while other rain-lashed crews are trying to complete running repairs while navigating the treacherous Southern Ocean. As the skipper of the Polish boat said: \"The Southern Ocean is very special. You are just in the middle of a big nature. It is not your place to be there.\" That became abundantly clear in watching sailors cope with the challenge not just of staying alive - difficult enough in itself in these seas - but also winning a race. If confirmation were needed of the hazardous nature of the enterprise, we were shown close-ups of one of the crew of the Polpharma-Warta having his head stitched up after a fall. Not for the squeamish. There must be easier ways to get a suntan and grow a beard. The Race is being brought to us by Sky Sports, who tell me each boat is equipped with seven cameras (that's as well as the rum and ship's biscuits and all that other stuff that sailors need), beaming pictures via satellite to race headquarters in Paris, where the material is compressed, edited and encoded for transmission. Apparently it takes 20 minutes to send one minute of broadcast-quality footage. I, for one, find it comforting that such trouble is being taken to refresh my jaded palate. Absolooey teriff, as Frostie might say. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
