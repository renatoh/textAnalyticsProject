The bond has now produced an album of covers which, however enjoyable, doesn\u2019t always take songs by the likes of John and JJ Cale, Ronnie Laine, Bon Iver and Bonnie Raitt to places they haven\u2019t been before. Spiritualized\u2019s The Straight and Narrow is very slightly more country, although it\u2019s such a great song it can\u2019t be heard enough. The pair put more of their own stamp \u2013 sublime harmonies, echo and slide guitars \u2013 on Sade\u2019s Bulletproof Soul, which makes the awkward transition from light soul to Americana without losing its eerie ennui. The album\u2019s best moment sees the pair remove the quirkiness and synthesisers from Talking Heads\u2019 Naive Melody (This Must Be the Place), but uncover the song\u2019s pure loveliness, and invest it with the haunting sense of wonderment from the best of their own work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
