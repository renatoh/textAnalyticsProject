Sounds pretty on brand, right? But the art \u2013 which blacks out most of her left arm and covers up previous tattoos \u2013 is invoking a vociferous reaction. The backlash could be summed up with the headline \u201cPeople Give Unsolicited Advice To Woman Who Changes Her Appearance\u201d. In 2019, there is a special brand of hatred reserved for women who push boundaries with their appearance. Von D received comments such as: \u201cWhy would you do that your skin is so pretty why would you cover it up with black ink like that?\u201d and \u201cWhen you put art out there, you risk getting negative comments\u201d (this is akin to another kind of advice which I like to call \u201cWhy You Are Asking For It Even Though You Never Asked\u201d). Von D responded to the hate-mail \u2013 which included insightful comments such as \u201cit\u2019s ugly\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re stupid\u201d \u2013 on Tuesday. She expressed her confusion over why her tattoo inspired such a strong reaction, considering that tattoos are personal and vary widely in their meaning and execution. She further clarified that a lot of the ink she had covered up in black had been badly done at a time when when she was young and drunk \u2013 she has now been 12 years sober. \u201cEven though tattoos are an outward expression, they really aren\u2019t for anyone else other than the person wearing it \u2026 Yes, I did decide to black out a large portion of old, crappy tattoos on my arm \u2026 Regardless of what people might think about it, I absolutely LOVE how simple and clean it looks now.\u201d I can see why some might have find Von D\u2019s tattoo shocking. At first it scared me \u2013 which says a lot more about my pain threshold than her taste in body art. But it would be remiss to forget that body modification has always incited intense reaction \u2013 from flesh-tunnels to bad tattoos \u2013 perhaps because it makes us think about our own fears of not fitting in. When I was younger, I used to have this very conversation with my dad all the time. He is socially conservative, religious and was born in Asia. He has a general fear of \u201cwesterners\u201d and their \u201ctraditions\u2019\u201d \u2013 particularly piercings. He called it self-mutilation and used to spend hours berating those who chose to have them. But it confused me: I had my ears pierced when I was a baby, and I had a nose ring by the time I was 12. Both of those things were normal to my Dad, since they were commonly done in his home country. He didn\u2019t put them in the same camp as septum piercings and stretched ears \u2013 but weren\u2019t they all the same thing? Why are we fine with tattoos, unless it\u2019s a blackout one? Is it really different from having a sleeve tattoo? Because surely the best example of someone feeling completely free and happy in their body is them using it whichever way they want to. Any woman hoping to cut her hair short, wear no makeup, or start lifting weights may as well go all the way and grow a third hand to give the finger to the Men With Opinions while she gets on with her day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
