Derby, who are \u00a335m in debt, are attempting to settle the contracts of their international defenders Horacio Carbonari and Bjorn Otto Bragstad. \"Discussions are well advanced over terminating their contracts,\" said Derby's chief executive Keith Loring. \"It is now a case of getting the final paperwork and legal niceties agreed between the parties.\" The settlements have been agreed by the Professional Footballers Association and mark the start of a clear-out. The former Scotland captain Craig Burley, the Georgian international Georgi Kinkladze and the French defender Fran\u00e7ois Grenet are next in line to have their contracts bought out as County take drastic action to reduce their annual \u00a317m wage bill. But Derby's director Bryan Richardson has confirmed that Fabrizio Ravanelli, who is the highest-paid player at Pride Park on \u00a340,000 a week, will remain. \"He's putting in a lot of work and doing the business,\" Richardson said. \"He can get us back into the Premiership by scoring goals.\" West Bromwich Albion's manager Gary Megson has suffered more frustration with the news that the Millwall striker Richard Sadlier will not be fit to play for at least six weeks. Megson hoped to sign the 23-year-old Republic of Ireland international before the transfer window closes at the end of the month but Sadlier has failed to recover from the hip injury that prevented him from playing in the World Cup. Albion's loss could be Aston Villa's gain. Millwall need to raise money and, with Sadlier out of the equation, may be persuaded to reduce their asking price for Tim Cahill. Villa are keen to sign the 22-year-old Australian midfielder and play him in tandem with Ipswich's \u00a34m-rated Matt Holland. But they are not so enthusiastic about paying \u00a33.5m for Cahill and \u00a322,000 a week to Holland. The Ajax striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has become the latest player to reject a move to Sunderland despite the clubs agreeing a \u00a36.2m fee. \"I'm not ready to leave,\" said the 6ft 5in Swedish international. The FA has paid a six-figure out-of-court settlement to an advertising agency after a legal row over England's \"Three Lions\" mascots. Interfocus claimed they came up with the idea for the cartoon characters Roary, Mayne and Pauz."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
