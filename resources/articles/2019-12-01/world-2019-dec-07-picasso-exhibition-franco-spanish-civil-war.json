The images, carefully arranged among hundreds of photographs, books, flags, paintings and audio archives, herald a belated homecoming. Eighty years after about 500,000 republican Spaniards crossed the border into France to escape Franco\u2019s forces in the final months of the civil war, the socialist government is marking the anniversary with a huge exhibition intended \u2013 as the justice minister, Dolores Delgado, puts it \u2013 to \u201csettle our overdue moral debt by rescuing truth from the pit of forgetfulness\u201d. Some of the exiles joined the French resistance, ending up in Nazi death camps; some helped liberate Paris; some fought with the Red Army \u2013 even taking on a division of the Spanish troops Franco dispatched to help the Germans; and some began new lives in Mexico, Argentina, Chile, the Caribbean, the USSR, the US and the UK. Divided into three parts, the exhibition chronicles the initial exile in France, life in the internment camps there, and the subsequent scattering of the republican diaspora. Long lines of men, women and children file through Capa\u2019s photographs and the paintings that record La Retirada (the Retreat), while the boats that carried the exiles across the Atlantic appear in snapshots, miniatures and in the newssheets put together by their passengers. The suffering of the 7,000 Spaniards who were sent to the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria is documented in the pictures taken there by Francesc Boix \u2013 photos that would later be used as evidence at Nuremberg. There is a portrait of the poet Antonio Machado, who died in the French Pyrenees three weeks after fleeing Spain, and first editions of the works of Arturo Barea, the exiled republican journalist who settled in England and worked for the BBC, where he gained a reputation as a kind of Spanish Alistair Cooke. \u201cSe\u00f1or Barea,\u201d George Orwell once noted, \u201cis one of the most valuable of the literary acquisitions that England has made as a result of Fascist persecution.\u201d More famous and more present throughout the exhibition, which opened last week at La Arquer\u00eda de Nuevos Ministerios, are the works of Picasso. Thirty-three contemporary photographs record the arrival in Spain in 1981 of perhaps the country\u2019s best known exile \u2013 Guernica \u2013 which was flown over from New York in the hold of an Iberia jumbo jet. Equally significant is a photograph, taken three years earlier at the Spanish embassy in Mexico City, in which King Juan Carlos and Queen Sof\u00eda clasp the hands of Dolores Rivas Cherif, the widow of Manuel Aza\u00f1a, the last president of the second republic. Juan Manuel Bonet, the curator of the main exhibition, sees the show as \u201can exercise in memory\u201d and a chance to reflect on all that was lost when half a million people escaped over the border. \u201cWhat had been lost by Spain was won by these other countries that took in the exiles,\u201d he says. \u201cI think democratic Spain owes a debt to that exiled Spain because the culture that was lost enriched other cultures \u2013 especially in countries like Mexico, where the exiles were so warmly welcomed. In Mexico, Spanish artists, writers, scientists and intellectuals integrated and imparted their knowledge.\u201d Bonet, a writer and critic who has served as director of both the Reina Sof\u00eda museum and the Instituto Cervantes, says the exhibition is also intended to pay tribute to the spirit of \u201cdemocratic justice\u201d that ushered in the post-Franco era. Four decades after the dictator\u2019s death, however, Spain\u2019s politics are deeply fragmented; the far-right now holds 52 seats in congress. \u201cWe always have a duty to remember what happened, especially at such a tense time in Spain,\u201d says Bonet. Were he forced to choose his favourite pieces from the more than 300 on show, the curator would opt for the miniature study of a fallen warrior that now adorns the memorial to Spanish members of the French resistance in the town of Annecy. And then there is Picasso\u2019s sketch of Mercedes S\u00e1nchez Cruz-L\u00f3pez, daughter of Manuel S\u00e1nchez Arcas, an exiled member of the republican government. The portrait, made in Warsaw in 1948, has never been shown in public. \u201cI suppose I have a certain weakness for it because it\u2019s not every day that you can exhibit a Picasso that\u2019s never been seen before,\u201d says Bonet. The exhibition ends with a group of works which explore the mythic appeal and legacy of some of the icons of Spanish literature. Among them is a sculpture of Don Quixote breathing his last, Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Tella\u2019s The Death of Garc\u00eda Lorca, painted in 1953, and a statue and an oil painting of the poet Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez, who died of tuberculosis in a Spanish prison in 1942. \u201cI\u2019ve finished the exhibition with a look back at the way they thought about the Quixote and Lorca and Hern\u00e1ndez,\u201d says Bonet. \u201cThose are just three of many, but the exiles took Spain with them in their minds wherever they went. And when they came back, they showed \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 that a part of Spanish culture had been produced outside Spain, and that should never have to happen again.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
