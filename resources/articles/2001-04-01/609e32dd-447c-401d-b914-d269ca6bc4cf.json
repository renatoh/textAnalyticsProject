Villa were 12th in the league of Premiership wages published recently by Deloitte and Touche, with last season's bill of \u00a321.55m amounting to less than half that paid by Chelsea and Manchester United. The club retain a slim chance of qualifying for Europe. But James, talking on the day Villa announced they were freezing season-ticket prices for the third successive season, said that the wages budget was geared to mediocrity. \"That isn't obviously the barometer of a performance during the season,\" the England goalkeeper said. \"But I just think that, if we are going to run our ship that way and the structure of the club is going to be that way, that is all that you can expect.\" James, who stressed he was not asking for a pay rise, hinted that money on a new stand could have been better spent. \"It will put us up with the top flight with regards to attendances next season . . . but, if you are paying mid-table wages and asking people to run mid-table budgets, then you get a mid-table side.\" Villa's Lee Hendrie has been charged with misconduct by the Football Association for \"over the top\" goal celebrations as he jumped over hoardings to mingle with fans. He faces a fine if found guilty of the charge, which Villa's manager John Gregory said he would fight. Frank Leboeuf has heightened speculation that he will leave Chelsea in summer. \"I still haven't closed the door on Monaco,\" he said of the club who pulled out of a deal in January. \"When I was talking with them, there were no financial problems and there is still a possibility of a deal being reached. I've been at Chelsea for five years and it may be that I've done all that I can.\" Bradford City's manager Jim Jefferies must decide whether to keep Benito Carbone after being given a \u00a35m wages' budget for next season. Carbone, a possible target for Chelsea, would take up 40% with his \u00a32m-a-year pay. Nottingham Forest and Preston have each been fined \u00a35,000 by the FA after a mass brawl at the City Ground in November. Brighton's striker Bobby Zamora has won the Nationwide player of the month award for March. Bayern Munich's Jens Jeremies and Giovane Elber are undergoing knee operations but still hope to be fit for the European Cup semi-final with Real Madrid. Surgery could not be delayed further and they must be considered doubts for the first leg in Spain on May 1. Real's Figo broke his nose in the win over Galatasaray and has an operation today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
