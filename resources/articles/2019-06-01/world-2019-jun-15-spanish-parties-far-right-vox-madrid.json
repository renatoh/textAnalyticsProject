On Saturday morning, three weeks after local and regional elections were held, the PP\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida was sworn in as mayor, with Citizens\u2019 Bego\u00f1a Villac\u00eds as his deputy. Mart\u00ednez-Almeida succeeds Manuela Carmena, a leftwing former judge whose four-year stint as mayor was marked by a commitment to diversity and the environment. The new mayor shrugged off criticism of his party\u2019s decision to work with Vox, challenging anyone \u201cto find anything that lies outside the legal order\u201d in his deals. But he also promised to serve all the people of Madrid. \u201cBetween us, we will build Madrid,\u201d said Mart\u00ednez-Almeida. \u201cWe won\u2019t leave behind those who want a more open Madrid. We want to write the future and not remember the past.\u201d Carmena congratulated her successor and reminded him of the importance of both feminism and democracy. \u201cWe need to look after democracy because we know what it cost to bring democracy to this country,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took so much, such an effort and so many lives that we cannot forget it.\u201d The PP has signalled that one of its first acts in office will be rethinking and possibly scrapping Carmena\u2019s urban low emissions zone, known as Madrid Central. Both the PP and Citizens have shifted further to the right over recent months in the hope of stopping their voters drifting towards Vox, whose tough line on Catalan independence, anti-immigration stance and tirades against feminism have attracted some traditional PP supporters. Citizens was subjected to fierce criticism last December after it cut a similar deal with Vox to govern the southern region of Andaluc\u00eda. Earlier this week, the French government explicitly warned Citizens \u2013 which is part of the new liberal group in the European parliament led by Emmanuel Macron \u2013 that any further cosying up to the far right would have consequences. On Friday, France\u2019s secretary of state for European affairs, Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin, expressed \u201cgrave concerns\u201d over such deals, adding: \u201cWe think that an alliance with the far right, like we have seen in Spain, is not an option.\u201d France\u2019s intervention led Vox to urge Spain\u2019s acting prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, to \u201cdefend Spaniards\u2019 independence\u201d in the face of \u201cunacceptable\u201d interference. The former French prime minister Manuel Valls, who staged an unsuccessful bid to become the mayor of Barcelona in last month\u2019s election, has also repeatedly warned his Citizens allies not to collaborate with Vox and called for a cordon sanitaire against the far right. Valls, who campaigned on a staunchly unionist platform, has thrown his weight behind Ada Colau, the leftwing mayor of Barcelona, who secured a second term in the Catalan capital in a vote on Saturday afternoon. The pro-independence Catalan Republican Left party won marginally more votes than Colau\u2019s group, but Colau retained office after reaching an agreement with the Catalan branch of the socialist party and Valls\u2019 councillors. Her election drew an angry response from some Catalan secessionists, who gathered in central Barcelona to protest and to chant, \u201cColau \u00e9s un frau!\u201d (\u201cColau is a fraud!\u201d). The wealthy northeastern region is governed by pro-independence parties. Although Citizens won the most seats and the largest share of the vote in the last regional election in December 2017, it could not assemble a governing coalition. The focus will now be on S\u00e1nchez\u2019s efforts to form a national government. While his Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party finished first in the general election at the end of April, it fell well short of a majority in the congress of deputies. S\u00e1nchez has agreed to cooperate with the anti-austerity Podemos party to work towards building a government, but has ruled out a coalition deal. He has also raised the possibility of holding another general election if his efforts to resume office are thwarted in parliament. Another vote \u2013 which would be Spain\u2019s fourth in under four years \u2013 would favour the socialists as it would hurt Podemos and see the three rightwing parties in renewed competition for votes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
