Permanent revolution equates to perpetual problems. The answer does not always lie in the chequebook. It may be a familiar critique of Queens Park Rangers but when the damning analysis comes from within their dressing room, it amounts to an insider's indictment of a failing club. \"The chairman is throwing money everywhere, left, right and centre and sometimes that doesn't work,\" the defender Clint Hill said. \"You've got to stick with people, work on them and try and get the best out of their ability. I just think we need a bit of stability.\" Instead, the only consistency Rangers have is of the unwanted variety. \"We're the bottom club and we've got a lovely 16-game winless streak, which is fantastic,\" added Hill. \"I still can't believe it. The table doesn't lie. We've been poor.\" This particular Clint has only seen the bad and the ugly; he hopes the good is to come. \"You can think: 'Oh my God, how the hell are we going to get out of this?'\" he said. \"Or you go: 'Sod this, let's prove people wrong.' If we do manage to do it, what an achievement it would be when you're sitting in your armchair in 15 or 20 years' time.\" Yet the path QPR may plot to survival could be a familiar one. The combination of Rangers and Harry Redknapp, a meeting of minds among shopaholics, meant mentions of Robbie Keane, Darren Bent, Nicolas Anelka, Joe Cole and Scott Parker were predictable. Hill has witnessed a revolving-door recruitment policy. Another overhaul, he says, may not be needed. New players have been a constant. \"We've had loads,\" he added. \"That's not the way to do it. I've been here three years now and I've seen loads come and go. I do think we will go and try and get a couple of players, but I don't think it will be five, six or seven.\" If his candour can seem unwise, Hill's no-nonsense style endears him to the supporters, who voted him their player of the year last season, and Redknapp alike. \"You need the lads who are going to roll up their sleeves for you,\" said the manager. Hill represents values lost in Mark Hughes' reign, of honest endeavour from a resolutely unglamorous player. Redknapp is seeking to restore them, with the spine of Neil Warnock's Championship-winning side, in Hill, Shaun Derry and Jamie Mackie, augmented by the battling qualities of Ryan Nelsen. They were the players saluted in song by the travelling fans. Rangers may have been blinded by the stardust of their new recruits but now it is about muck and nettles, not men with medals. \"Whatever they have won before is in the past,\" Redknapp added. \"They may have won Champions Leagues, but this is all about now. They obviously haven't performed to their potential this season.\" It is an understatement. The scale of their plight means Redknapp suggests the blame will lie elsewhere if Rangers go down. \"People ain't stupid,\" he said. \"I don't feel under pressure.\" This is the footballing equivalent of a shot to nothing. Yet there was a voice of optimism. Wigan's ever upbeat manager, Roberto Mart\u00ednez, believes Redknapp can keep Rangers up. \"Absolutely. I am convinced of that,\" he said. His side are both an example to, and the antithesis of, QPR. Wigan propped up the Premier League in March before winning seven of their final nine games to stay up. \"We have been in a similar situation,\" added Mart\u00ednez. But by making a solitary signing last January, the influential Jean Beausejour, they proved an influx of arrivals is not the only route to safety.
