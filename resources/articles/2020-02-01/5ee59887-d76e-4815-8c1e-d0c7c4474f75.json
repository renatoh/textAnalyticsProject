Alli, who has been on holiday during his club\u2019s winter break, posted the video of him wearing a face mask in an airport departure lounge on Saturday with the message: \u201cCorona whattt, please listen with volume.\u201d The 23-year-old then zooms the camera towards an unsuspecting man of Asian appearance before panning to a bottle of antiseptic hand wash captioned: \u201cThis virus gunna have to be quicker than that to catch me.\u201d The video was subsequently deleted after several complaints were made, with Alli issuing a statement on Sunday evening in which he admitted he had \u201clet myself down and the club\u201d. \u201cI\u2019d like to apologise for the video I posted on Snapchat yesterday,\u201d Alli said in a video released on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t funny. I realised that immediately and took it down. I let myself down and the club. I don\u2019t want you guys to have that impression of me. \u201cIt isn\u2019t something that should be joked about. Sending all my love and thoughts and prayers for everyone in China.\u201d Tottenham have so far declined to comment on the story, although it is understood Alli was on his way to Dubai for a short holiday before next Sunday\u2019s Premier League fixture against Aston Villa. The incident comes after Asian communities in the UK reported a significant increase in racist incidents in response to the global health crisis. In Sheffield, a postgraduate student was reportedly verbally and physically harassed in the street for wearing a face mask, while in Leicestershire two students \u2013 mistakenly thought to be Chinese \u2013 were pelted with eggs on the street in Market Harborough. The Manchester Chinese Centre has received scores of complaints of racist incidents targeting children in schools across the region."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
