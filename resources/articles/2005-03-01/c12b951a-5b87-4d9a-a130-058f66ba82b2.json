Mr Parkinson takes the newly created role of national brand director, overseeing the development of all Emap's national analogue and digital radio brands - Kiss, Magic, Kerrang!, Q, Smash Hits, The Hits, Heat and Mojo. Earlier this week Emap appointed former Capital Radio boss Andria Vidler to run its Magic network. The London-based station recently leapfrogged Heart to take second place in the capital's audience ratings. Mr Parkinson, who was the marketing director of Chrysalis Radio as well as Heart's managing director, launched the Galaxy dance music brand, relaunched LBC and, in 2003, took Heart to the number one position in London during his decade at the group. The announcement of his departure comes at a crucial time for Heart. The station is trying to regain ground lost to Magic and catch up with the market leader, Capital. Heart is also gearing up to relaunch its flagship breakfast show, with Jamie Theakston taking over from Jono Coleman. Chrysalis said it was sad to see him go and would begin to search for a successor immediately. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
