In Gentleman's Agreement (1947), liberal reporter Gregory Peck pretends to be a Jew as a means of exposing anti-semitism in postwar America. In cynical form, the arms dealer played by Nicolas Cage enters America with his family pretending they are Ukrainian Jews and immediately signs up with New York's Russian Mafia in Lord of War (2005). Most painfully in Louis Malle's semi-autobiographical Au Revoir, les Enfants (1987), Jewish teenagers in Nazi-occupied France are concealed as pupils of a Roman Catholic boarding school and are accidentally betrayed to the Gestapo. Radu Mihaileanu, a Jewish film-maker who fled his oppressive native Romania via Israel in 1980 to work in France, draws on his complicated emotional history (his communist father changed the family name to obscure the provocative racial affiliation) in taking the deception in the other direction. The central character of Live and Become passes himself off as a Jew or, rather, is propelled by his Ethiopian mother into 20 painful years as an impostor. The movie begins in 1985 when Mossad, with considerable assistance from the United States, ran the clandestine Operation Moses to airlift thousands of starved and persecuted Ethiopian Jews to Israel from refugee camps across the border in Sudan. These dark-skinned 'indelible immigrants', to use a term coined by historian Daniel Boorstin, known as the Falasha, are still not fully assimilated into Israeli society. The nine-year-old hero and his widowed Christian mother, last survivors of a family destroyed by famine and war, are at the same camp. When the small son of a Falasha widow dies shortly after being accepted for transportation, she agrees to take the Gentile boy in his place and she gives him the name Solomon, or Schlomo. His mother bids the terrified lad farewell with the words that gives the film its title: 'Go. Live. Become.' 'Go' is the urgent instruction to find security in Israel. 'Live' is her counsel to seize a sudden chance to survive and prosper. 'Become' is more problematic, and the movie is constantly alert to what it means in a world of emigration and immigration, asylum seeking and economic migration, where identities are assumed, imposed, blurred and recreated. The opening section is full of suspense and danger. Can Schlomo convince the Israeli authorities that he's a Jew? Immediately before his interrogation on Israeli soil, a boy a few years older has his cover blown and is roughly escorted from the reception hall, shoved into a car and driven away to be repatriated. Schlomo gets by, but his ailing surrogate mother dies. A Dickensian episode follows in which, burdened by guilt and loneliness, he fails to adapt to life in various orphanages. Finally, he's adopted by a kindly Sephardic Franco-Israeli couple, extremely well played by French actor Roschdy Zem and celebrated Israeli actress Yael Abecassis. These foster-parents, left-wing, semi-secular Jews who initially think the newcomer has been raised in the orthodox faith, draw the boy out and encourage their son and daughter to make him welcome. They represent much of what is best in the state of Israel and protect him from the prejudice, some of it truly ferocious, to which the Falasha are exposed. These sequences are subtly handled, with moral force and without sentimentality. The years pass, Schlomo takes on a new identity, has a Romeo and Juliet-style love affair with a Jewish girl, works on a kibbutz, experiences the tensions engendered by the Gulf War and the intifadas and, as part of his journey of discovery, attempts to contact his mother. At times, melodrama looms and the film becomes schematic. The years Schlomo spends studying medicine in Paris, when he becomes aware of how he might transcend his problems and give practical assistance to his native Ethiopia, are condensed into a couple of minutes with voice-over dialogue. Still, Mihaileanu never lets us lose sight of Schlomo's guilt and inner turmoil as his life becomes a search for healing, redemption and a fully achieved sense of self. Brave, moving and compassionate, Live and Become deals boldly, yet sensitively, with issues crucial to our times."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
