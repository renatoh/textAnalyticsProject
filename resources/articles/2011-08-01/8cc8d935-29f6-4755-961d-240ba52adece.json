The 92.3-minute orbit of the ISS takes it across the Earth's equator at an angle of 51.64\u00b0 so that by the time it reaches a latitude of 51.64\u00b0 N (just to the N of London) some 23 minutes later its motion is directly from W to E at a height of 391km. On its best transits, such as the one on Friday evening, it can pass just N of London's zenith, though that same transit reaches only 60\u00b0 high in the S for Manchester and 35\u00b0 for watchers in Edinburgh."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
