If so, get along to the Beacon arts project in Mablethorpe, Lincolnshire, this weekend, for a competition inviting local people to show off their talents - including facial spoon hanging, bird impressions, musical toast-scraping and ukulele-playing. The three-day festival celebrating performance art will also feature a recreation in the town's library of Bruce Nauman's 1968 work, Walk with Contrapposto, and a threesided football match played on a hexagonal pitch . \"It's a great chance to prove that contemporary art shown in a rural context doesn't have to involve carved benches,\" says John Plowman, the festival's co-founder. \u00b7 Email your arts stories to arts.diary@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
