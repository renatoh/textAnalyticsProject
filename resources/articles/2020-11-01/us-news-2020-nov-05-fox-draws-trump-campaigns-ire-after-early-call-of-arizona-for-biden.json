In the process, the channel switched the media\u2019s attention away from Trump\u2019s substantial success in Florida and undermined the president\u2019s attempts to focus attention on the vote counting in Pennsylvania. Such was the level of fury within the Trump campaign at the call that his team reportedly attempted to have the decision overturned. According to the New York Times, this involved Jared Kushner contacting Fox\u2019s owner, Rupert Murdoch, while in Vanity Fair\u2019s reporting it was the president himself who called the media mogul. Regardless of who was placing the calls, Fox has stuck by its decision \u2013 much to the anger of many of its viewers who have bombarded the channel with complaints. The decision to call the ultra-close Arizona race for Biden \u2013 a victory that was later also declared by the Associated Press, which provides results data to the Guardian \u2013 was made by Fox\u2019s Arnon Mishkin, who runs the broadcaster\u2019s decision desk. Before the election, Mishkin, a registered Democrat who has worked for Fox News for decades, had made clear that he would not be swayed by internal pressure in making calls for states. As a result, Mishkin has been portrayed as a defender of the truth, representing the uneasy balance that exists between Fox\u2019s straight news division and the highly opinionated rightwing hosts who shape the external perception of the channel. On Thursday, Mishkin, who has become a target for angry Trump supporters, told the channel\u2019s viewers that he would not be changing his mind on the basis that \u201cwe strongly believe that our call will stand, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re not pulling back the call\u201d. Dismissing claims from Trump\u2019s team that they could still edge ahead in the ultra-close race as more votes were counted, a visibly exasperated Mishkin pushed back and said the objections were like talking about what would happen \u201cif a frog had wings\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re confident that the data will basically look like the data we\u2019ve noticed throughout the count in Arizona,\u201d he said. Trump and his team have an increasingly complicated relationship with Fox News. Throughout his presidency he has been an obsessive watcher of the channel, often providing commentary on his Twitter feed about its audience ratings when he objects to its coverage and phoning in to dispute specific issues. On the day of the election he complained on air about the channel\u2019s coverage not being sufficiently supportive: \u201cSomebody said what\u2019s the difference between this and four years ago, and I say Fox \u2026 In the old days you wouldn\u2019t put \u2018Sleepy Joe\u2019 on every time he opens his mouth. You had Democrats on more than you had Republicans. I\u2019m not complaining. I\u2019m just telling people.\u201d One of the bigger questions in US rightwing media is what happens if Trump loses the election, with longstanding speculation that he could be tempted to start his own media outlet in a bid to communicate directly with his supporters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
