The Democratic senator from Oregon last month submitted three questions to the National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) about the hacking earlier this year of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), in which the personal information of 21 million people was exposed. In August, Wyden asked whether the NCSC had identified as a security risk the OPM\u2019s giant database of federal security clearances, which includes personal and identifying information as private as psychiatric evaluations and social security numbers. Wyden also asked whether the NCSC had made any recommendations related to better securing the database, which retains data going back to 1985. The theft of the information exposed some 21 million current, former and prospective government employees and has been attributed to Chinese hackers by the US government. The placement of blame is at the forefront of many minds in the nation\u2019s capital. \u201c[E]xecutive branch oversight of agency information security policies and practices rests with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS),\u201d wrote William Evanina, director of the NCSC and also the National Counterintelligence Executive. Evanina, appointed to his position by national intelligence director James Clapper last year, told Wyden that his department doesn\u2019t tell other agencies how to handle IT security. Wyden professed himself unimpressed. \u201cThe OPM breach had a huge counterintelligence impact and the only response by the nation\u2019s top counterintelligence officials is to say that it wasn\u2019t their job,\u201d he wrote in an emailed statement, calling it \u201ca bureaucratic response\u201d that was \u201cunworthy of individuals who are being trusted to defend America\u201d. \u201cWhile the National Counterintelligence and Security Center shouldn\u2019t need to advise agencies on how to improve their IT security,\u201d he wrote, \u201cit must identify vulnerabilities so that the relevant agencies can take the necessary steps to secure their data.\u201d Wyden also slammed other members of the US Senate for trying to railroad the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (Cisa) through in response to the hack. \u201cThe Senate is now trying to respond to the OPM hack by passing a bill that would lead to more personal information being shared with these agencies,\u201d Wyden wrote. \u201cThe way to improve cybersecurity is to ensure that network owners take responsibility for plugging security holes, not encourage the sharing of personal information with agencies that can\u2019t protect it adequately.\u201d Evannina, who led an investigation into the effects of Edward Snowden\u2019s disclosures of NSA surveillance of Americans, is a prominent figure of authority on the topic of leaks and unauthorized disclosure. Asked by intelligence publication DefenseOne about where insider leaks sit on the government\u2019s list of priorities, Evanina said that the government had been on high alert since Chelsea Manning and WikiLeaks revealed the killing of Iraqi journalists in 2010, \u201cbut it sped up from a regional railway to the Acela train\u201d after the Snowden revelations. The NCSC\u2019s website says the center \u201cprovides effective leadership and support to the counterintelligence and security activities of the US Intelligence Community, the US Government, and US private sector entities who are at risk of intelligence collection or attack by foreign adversaries\u201d. In response to Wyden\u2019s third question \u2013 why the OPM had a database going back 30 years \u2013 Evanina wrote: \u201cThe ability to assess the \u2018whole person\u2019 over a long period of time enables security clearance adjudicators to identify and address any issues (personnel security or counterintelligence-related) that may exist or may arise.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
