But with second-hand book dealing now practically banished to the internet and two small towns in Wales, and when most bookshops are pristine, strip-lighted affairs devoted to multi-buys, where exactly are the truly bookish - or, for that matter, the decayed people smelling of stale breadcrusts - expected to go these days? For those bibliophiles who yearn for a whiff of an era when a chap wanting something bound in leather on the Charing Cross Road looked to Marks &amp; Co, not Ann Summers, Slightly Foxed will come as manna from heaven. With a name derived from the dealer's argot for the kind of liver spots that blossom on musty volumes, it couldn't be more bookish if it tried. Fondling its delightfully crisp, cream pages you can almost feel corduroy patches sprouting from your elbows. Unashamedly crumbly in its outlook, its preference is for writers, books and publishers of the old school (ie alcoholics, dissolute aristocrats, waspish bluestockings, and so on). Simon Raven, Josephine Tey and the Puffin Book Club are considered here; the next issue promises Simon Brett discussing \"Gwen Raverat's achievement as a wood engraver\". I, for one, can't wait. Crimewave 8: Cold Harbours (\u00a36.99, or \u00a322pa for four issues; www.ttapress.com) This is a plush-looking quarterly that publishes original crime fiction stories. Beyond that, definitions become a little tricky because the folks at Crimewave, in the manner of Alastair Campbell on Tony Blair and the topic of God, have firm ideas about what they don't do - firmer, possibly, than about what they do do. \"We don't do cosy,\" they maintain. \"We don't do hardboiled. We don't do noir.\" What, precisely, do they do then? \"Something entirely different to anything you've ever read before,\" apparently. Ever? Anything? The bravado, if a little ludicrous, does at least confirm a willingness to go beyond some of the conventions of the genre, an aspiration that's worth applauding. The quality of the writing itself, certainly in this issue, is frequently very high indeed - as, unsurprisingly, is the body count. A couple of the pieces have rather gothic flavours about them. A Marilyn Manson CD has a cameo in one, and Michelle Scalise's \"The Beautiful Ones\", a spooky tale narrated by a chloral-supping aesthete, goes the whole hog and plunges into the demimonde of Oscar Wilde's Victorian London. Tom Brennan's \"Scarecrow\", meanwhile, demonstrates that European spoil can be just as fertile ground for Southern gothic as Alabama."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
