A new booklet, House Sparrows in Great Britain, funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and produced in partnership with the RSPB and British Trust for Ornithology, offers guidance on how people can create suitable habitats to increase sparrow numbers. The advice ranges from how to cut lawns to best encourage insects, to the type of seeds householders can leave out for the birds during the lean winter months. The move is in response to new research showing that sparrow numbers over the last 30 years have fallen from 12 million pairs to fewer than 7 million pairs, with the most marked decline in suburban and urban gardens. Ben Bradshaw, minister for nature conservation, said: \"The friendly chatter of sparrows is a much loved part of British life. This is a very dramatic decline but it is not irreversible. If we all play our part, the population of this treasured bird can be increased. \"The leaflet we are launching today provides effective proactive advice on how individuals and communities can improve the habitat in their local area by making it house sparrow friendly. Through these actions I hope we can begin to redress the balance and allow these birds which we all know and love to thrive once again.\" The RSPB's conservation director, Dr Mark Avery, said: \"The house sparrow is the one bird in Britain where everyone can take action to help save it. With more help from more people everyone could once again have a chance of seeing sparrows from their front doorstep.\" The latest initiative, launched on the same day as a conference on the plight of the sparrow in London's City Hall, is aimed in particular at gardeners in London and the south east of England where populations have declined most rapidly. Rosie Cleary, house sparrow officer for the British Trust for Ornithology, said: \"The disappearance of house sparrows seems to be connected to the way we build our houses and the ease with which birds can find food. \"The situation is becoming critical in London, but there are large numbers of gardens across the UK from which house sparrows have disappeared. We need help both from people who still have house sparrows and, probably more importantly, from home owners who have lost them.\" The House Sparrows in Great Britain booklet is being sent to members of the RSPB and the British Trust for Ornithology and will be available in public libraries. The main advice offered is as follows: Provide shelter Plant trees, shrubs and climbers - birch, elder, spindle, hawthorn, honeysuckle, ivy, bramble and/or wild roses - that can provide thick cover, as well as food, for sparrows. Lightly trim the branches of bushes in winter to encourage thick growth for nesting, but remember to delay trimming until most berries have gone. Also, avoid trimming between March and August when birds may be nesting. Provide food Small annual plants, often considered to be weeds, such as chickweed, charlock, fat hen, groundsel, shepherd's purse, dandelion, plantains and vetches all provide seeds, fruits or insects that are suitable for house sparrows. Herbaceous plants such as nettle, geranium, honeysuckle and nightshade, and ornamental plants such as cotoneaster, firethorn, wallflower, antirrhinum, stock and borage, provide similar benefits. When planning changes in the garden, consider including some of these beneficial species. Leaving a small weedy patch in the garden through winter could also provide food for house sparrows and other birds.
