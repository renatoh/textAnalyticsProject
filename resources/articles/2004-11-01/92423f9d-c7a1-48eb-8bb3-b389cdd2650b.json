In this improbable setting, behind the three-storey brick facade of an ordinary house, is one of the great lost works of the architectural arts, and the last project of Charles Rennie Mackintosh's life. Number 78 Derngate lies in a terrace on a radial road in sturdy, red-brick Northampton, heart of the county of \"squires and spires\". It was here, in 1916, that Mr Wenham Joseph Bassett-Lowke decided to commission an interior scheme from Mackintosh for the house he shared with his wife. This home has been restored to its original glory and is now open to the public, providing an extraordinary addition to architectural history. Since it opened late last year, it has been so popular that an appointments system is in operation. \"We've already had visitors from around the world,\" says Sylvia Pinches, curator of the museum. Bassett-Lowke, a first-time buyer, had acquired the skinny house on the basis that the area would rise. \"They'd been lower-middle-class houses for rent and were becoming fashionable,\" says Pinches. \"Gentrification is not a new thing.\" As it happened, Bassett-Lowke - a 38-year-old manufacturer of model trains - was a member of the Design and Industries Association, which campaigned for good design for the masses under the banner \"fit for purpose\". Full of civic zeal, Bassett-Lowke was ready to put his patronage into practice. Hampered by the first-world-war ban on new building, he decided to refurbish instead, with his favourite designer, helped by a local architect, Alexander Anderson. Most know Mackintosh as the Scottish architect-designer who made ladder-backed chairs, luminous interiors and the flower stencils that prefigured art nouveau. He now occupies a more vital rung as a proto-modernist and, more prosaically, an ambassador - the Gaud\u00ed of Glasgow, if you will. Yet when Bassett-Lowke came across him, the 48-year-old Scot was not in his first flush. Depressive and all too often drunk, the handsome, mustachioed Mackintosh was considered to be on the way down and had left his home country. He'd fallen out with colleagues and had moved with his wife, Margaret Macdonald, to the Suffolk coast, where he'd been treated with distrust and denounced as a spy, before moving to Chelsea to re-establish himself. Bassett-Lowke, who had a shop in London, met Mackintosh in Chelsea. He commissioned him to do first graphics, then his home. The Derngate house was to signal the return of Mac, and architect and client set out to make a splash. \"The point was to turn a poky house into a modern, convenient one with all the latest appliances and with this breath-taking scheme by Mackintosh,\" says Pinches. The very essence of the enlightened progressive family, the Bassett-Lowkes were very proud of it. \"They were the type to send postcards of their house,\" says Pinches. Amazingly, the house survived intact through its various uses during the late 20th century - from school to an off-licence chain's office. The tiled kitchen, for example, is almost complete, but it's just a foretaste of the magic to follow. Through a door is a capsule of pure Mackintosh fancy: a black-painted front room with air-brushed gold and silver stencils on the walls, and Mackintosh furniture. \"Imagine,\" says Pinches, \"what would the people next door have thought of this? This is dark and dramatic.\" Mackintosh rebuilt the staircase lateral and divided it with coloured glass, which has, amazingly, survived the intervening 88 years. It's an echo of Viennese painter Gustav Klimt. There's also a little of Frank Lloyd Wright in the waffle-iron light fitting. Some Mackintosh buffs consider Derngate a lesser work, but not its friends. \"If you're stuck on droopy women and pink roses, you'll be disappointed,\" says Pinches. \"Or pleasantly surprised.\" Upstairs, the dining room is less intensely Mackintosh. The restoration relied heavily on two articles from Ideal Home magazine with black-and-white photographs. \"We're not wildly happy we've got the colour right,\" says Pinches, gesturing at the carpet. \"It's acidic to our eye. But perceptions of colour have changed over the years. One person's puce is another person's petunia.\" Also remarkably modish is the bathroom which, with its large American bath, heated towel rail and plate-sized shower head, wouldn't look out of place in a modern hotel. The mock-mosaic wallpaper is the thing: the forensics picked up a chad of wallpaper behind the towel rail, and a spare roll was tracked down. Upstairs lies the house's second great statement in the shape of the guest bedroom. Described by Ideal Home magazine in 1920 as \"the most daring in the house\", it employs beaded lanterns and a retina-slicing striped canopy, anticipating 1960s op art. \"You think from the photographs that it'd give you a hangover,\" says Pinches. \"When we took the lampshades out, I thought, 'No.' But it's quite calm. The curves harmonise against the geometry somehow.\" It didn't bother the most famous guest, George Bernard Shaw, who came here to speak to Labour candidates before the 1918 and 1922 elections. Bassett-Lowke's study, the last room, is unfurnished. \"The same Ideal Home article of 1920 said it wasn't very interesting and didn't include it,\" says Pinches. Bassett-Lowke moved on. In the 1920s, he commissioned a house, New Ways, also in Northampton, from German architect-theorist Peter Behrens. Pevsner called it \"the first truly modern house in England\". Number 78 Derngate, meanwhile, turned out to be Mackintosh's last major commission. He gave up architecture in his early 50s, and died at 60, all but destitute. He might have been surprised at its reincarnation as a visitor attraction - and that he has given Junction 15 on the M1 a new destiny. Life of a designer Mackintosh, Charles Rennie (1868-1928), was the second son in a family of 11. His father, a police superintendent, instilled in him a deep appreciation of Scotland's cultural heritage. He was articled at 16 to John Hutchison, and left when his apprenticeship ended in 1889 to join the firm of Honeyman &amp; Keppie as a draughtsman. From 1884, he went to evening classes at the Glasgow School of Art, where he met the Macdonald sisters - his future wife, Margaret, and Frances - who together with Mackintosh and Herbert MacNair formed the Glasgow Four. They pioneered art nouveau designs, drawing on Celtic ornament and the economy of Japanese art, and were invited to send their work to the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in 1896. That same year, Mackintosh won the competition for the design of the new Glasgow School of Art building which, along with his interiors for the entrepreneur Catherine Cranston, became his best-known work in the city. He was extraordinarily influential in Europe and the US, though recognition in his home town was slow to come. Despite his originality, a reputation for unreliability, eccentricity and drink led to his professional decline. In 1914, the Mackintoshes left Glasgow. Before settling in London, they lived for a year in Walberswick, Suffolk, where their 'foreign' accents and correspondence with Viennese and German nationals drew the attention of the police. A continuing creativity is evident in his few later commissions, but it was to be stifled by financial insecurity and illness. Mackintosh never regained his professional status after the first world war. Evicted from his Hampstead lodgings, he died in a London nursing home in December 1928, aged 60, and his death was little remarked. His various drawings and design sketches were deemed practically worthless, valued at \u00a388 after his death. \u00b7 Extracted from The Arts And Crafts Companion, by Pamela Todd, published by Thames &amp; Hudson at \u00a329.95.
