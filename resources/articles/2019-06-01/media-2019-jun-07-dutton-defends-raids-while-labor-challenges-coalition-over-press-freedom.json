On Friday morning an interview on Channel Nine\u2019s Today descended into a slanging match, with the home affairs minister accusing Labor of attacking the Australian federal police\u2019s investigations while the new Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, accused Dutton of epitomising \u201csecrecy and a lack of scrutiny\u201d. Raids on the the ABC and News Corp Australia\u2019s Annika Smethurst and possible charges for reproduction of secret documents in their reports on alleged unlawful killings by Australian troops in Afghanistan and plans to extend powers to spy on Australian citizens have set off a firestorm about media freedom. While Labor\u2019s shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, has called for a bipartisan review of national security laws and Scott Morrison has said he is \u201copen to discussing\u201d concerns about the raids, Dutton moved to head off any debate about changing the laws. \u201cIf we strip it down we are talking about highly classified documents,\u201d he told Today. \u201cThe laws that apply today are the same laws that [would have] applied under the Shorten government or [applied under the] Rudd government or Howard government in relation to the leaking of documents.\u201d Dutton said the idea there would be \u201cno penalty\u201d for publishing top secret documents \u201cwould go against tradition in this country that would span back decades, and the same around the world\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that if people are leaking top secret documents, that that can affect our national security.\u201d The home affairs minister said the AFP had an obligation to investigate the matters after they were referred by the secretary of the defence department and the director general of the Australian Signals Directorate. Dutton said it was \u201cquite unfair\u201d for Labor to criticise AFP officers, prompting Albanese to correct him, that he was \u201ctargeting the government\u201d. Albanese said it was true \u201cthese are old laws\u201d but \u201cAustralians are concerned that media\u2019s capacity to scrutinise government is under threat\u201d. Dutton demanded Albanese apologise, which he refused to do. \u201cYou characterise secrecy and a lack of scrutiny that embodies your entire political career,\u201d Albanese replied. Later, at the declaration of his election in Grayndler, Albanese told reporters that freedom of the press is \u201cfundamental to democracy\u201d. \u201cMr Morrison and Mr Dutton have to say exactly what their position is on freedom of the press. \u201cAt the moment they\u2019re silent about it \u2013 they pretend it\u2019s nothing to do with them and there\u2019s nothing to see here.\u201d Asked about changes to legislation, Albanese said it would be \u201ca start\u201d for Morrison to acknowledge there is an issue which is \u201cdisturbing\u201d. \u201cAnnika Smethurst is a professional journalist \u2026 who told Australians that there were proposals being considered that would cause concern for all those worried about the privacy of Australian citizens. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing that was reported, frankly, because Australians do have a right to know what is going in a democracy.\u201d Earlier, Dutton said there were \u201cno proposals\u201d to extend spying powers, claiming the issue had been \u201cwrongly reported\u201d and debate could have occurred when legislation was presented \u201caround whatever the proposal might be\u201d. On Thursday the acting AFP commissioner, Neil Gaughan, attempted to contain the growing political fallout by denying suggestions the police had waited until after the federal election to execute warrants and claiming no contact had been made with the executive since they informed Dutton\u2019s office when the investigations started. The Liberal MP Craig Kelly, who chairs parliament\u2019s joint committee on law enforcement, has said the AFP will be called to explain its decision as \u201cthe first order of business\u201d once MPs returned to Canberra in July. The Labor senator Doug Cameron has called for a new standing committee to scrutinise AFP and security agencies\u2019 operations, while the Greens and Centre Alliance have called for freedom of the press to be enshrined in a charter of rights or the constitution."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
