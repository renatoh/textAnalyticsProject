Every single player's performance was wooden - apart from Martin Keown's, that is. The Arsenal defender took a mouthful of nutty log, let his lips curl into a gormless smile, and nodded at Michael Owen as if to say: \"This is one tasty product!\" And finally, today, Keown apologised for his \"bad reaction\" when he ... pardon? ... what? ... oh. Martin Keown today apologised for his \"bad reaction\" when pushing Ruud van Nistelrooy in his big equine face during Arsenal's defeat at Manchester United on Saturday. The apology was issued through the medium of Arsene Wenger. \"I've not seen a replay of the incident,\" began Wenger/Keown predictably/tediously, \"but Martin told me this morning that he's sorry. He has apologised as he said it was a bad reaction.\" Keown's frantic and craven back-pedalling may or may not be a result of referee Dermot Gallagher's admission that he \"didn't see\" the incident, therefore allowing the FA's video advisory panel to do their worst. \"I fear FA action against Martin,\" trembled Wenger, his knees knocking the next sentence out in Morse code: \"If he is charged, he is charged and we will defend him. But he has shown a big attitude in saying that he's sorry.\" Meanwhile, up the Seven Sisters Road, or a few stops down the Piccadilly Line, or however the hell you get there, Spurs are also worried about a bit of FA wrist-slappery. Former Wolves striker Robbie Keane did that ear-cupping goal celebration to West Brom fans who had been shouting at him a bit, and apparently this could have incited a riot. \"We are also awaiting the referee's report on that incident,\" said an FA spokesperson, who clearly has nothing better to do.

QUOTE OF THE DAY \"We won the European Cup Winners' Cup, the Spanish Cup and the Super Cup. We had a great year, a stupendous year. We scored over 100 goals - and I still got bombed. But I have no bitterness about it, it was just bizarre, that was all. It was bizarre rather than bitter, but it was a great part of my life\" - Rir Sobby Bobson recalls his Barcelona sacking fondly. MAN ARRESTED OVER FAN'S DEATH Police investigating the death of a teenage football fan, who died after a fight broke out before the match between Burnley and Nottingham Forest on Saturday, have arrested a 19-year-old man. Forest supporter Nathan Shaw, 17, of Aspley in Nottinghamshire, died yesterday morning from fatal injuries following an incident outside a bar in Burnley town centre on Saturday, two hours before the match kicked off. A police spokeswoman said: \"A 19-year-old Burnley man has been arrested in connection with the incident and has been taken to a Burnley police station where he will be interviewed.\" The incident took place outside Yates's Wine Lodge in St James's Street, around a mile from Burnley's Turf Moor ground. A post-mortem examination on Shaw's body ruled that the official cause of death was a \"blunt force head injury\". Nottingham Forest's chief executive Mark Arthur told the club's website: \"We were shocked to learn of Mr Shaw's death and would like to extend out sincere condolences to Mr Shaw's family and friends.\" A statement on the Burnley FC website said the club would like to express their sympathies to the family and Nottingham Forest Football Club. THE RUMOUR MILL Greedy Kevin Keegan wants to buy Djamel Belmadi (Marseille), Bjorn Arne Riise (Aalesund), Shabani Nondra (Monaco), Eidur Gudjohnsen (Chelsea) and Francis Jeffers (Arsenal, very rarely) in the January sales. The Imperial Lord Ferg is still chasing Ronaldhino and hopes to snare his man in January. He's offering Paris St-Germain \u00a325m, and dangling a \u00a33m-a-year carrot before the rabbit-toothed Brazilian striker. Pesky, problematic Pierre van Hooijdonk could be heading from Feyenoord to Birmingham for \u00a31m. NEWS IN BRIEF Rir Sobby Bobson has revealed he recently turned down the chance to become manager of Portuguese giants Benfica. The 69-year-old told Newcastle's Evening Chronicle: \"They told me that I was their No1 choice and gave me an hour to make my mind up but I only needed minutes to tell them 'no'. As manager of Newcastle United, I have the job of my dreams. This is the job of my life and it is also my last job.\" The Portuguese side instead turned to Spain's World Cup coach Jose Antonio Camacho at the end of November. West Ham defender Vladimir Labant could be set for a return to Sparta Prague in January. The Slovakian has appeared just 13 times in the last 11 months and is keen to return home. Sunderland's crocked midfielder Jason McAteer will be out of action for a further two months after undergoing a second hernia operation over the weekend. Merseyside police have cleared Liverpool's El Hadji Diouf after an investigation into allegations that he spat at West Ham fans last month. The police received complaints from fans after the game at Anfield on November 2, alleging that the Senegal international, an unused substitute, had spat in their direction whilst warming up. Ex-Ipswich Town manager George Burley has expressed an interest in the vacancy at Aberdeen. Burley joins Bruce Rioch, Steve Paterson and current caretaker boss Gardner Speirs among names being considered to succeed the departing Ebbe Skovdahl. Birmingham City are hopeful of having Steve Vickers and Michael Johnsen ready for first-team action soon after lengthy injury lay-offs. Boss Steve Bruce said: \"They both played last week and were sore, as you would expect after so long out, but at least they were OK and that basically was just fatigue.\" TONIGHT'S TV &amp; RADIO ITV1: The Premiership On Monday (11.55pm) It's still Christmas party season and \"Docker\" writes: \"Since a student from China was nearing the end of his short-term assignment, we decided to combine the Christmas party with his leaving party at a popular Manchester Italian restaurant.\" Big Cup Weekly (12.55am) \"The place was packed to the rafters with groups from other companies, all having the common aim of getting as trousered as possible.
