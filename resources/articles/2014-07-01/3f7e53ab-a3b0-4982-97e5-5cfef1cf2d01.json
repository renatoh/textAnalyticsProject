Democratic state senators Loretta Weinberg and Raymond Lesniak said on Friday that they had submitted a senate bill to make it a fourth-degree crime punishable by a fine of up to $500,000 to give financial donations to political campaigns after receiving a state development subsidy. The Guardian disclosed last month that subsidies totalling $1.25bn had been awarded by Christie\u2019s New Jersey Economic Development Authority in less than two years to ventures involving firms that made significant donations to Republicans, or had senior executives who did. Among these were a $106m tax break for the property venture of Christie\u2019s close friend and chief campaign fundraiser, Jon Hanson, and a $223m award to a retail development by Prudential, which is both a major contributor to the Republican Governors Association, a national committee chaired by Christie, and the biggest corporate funder of Christie\u2019s official mansion. \u201cWe have drawn up this bill because of the vast amounts of money raised from companies in receipt of these subsidies by Chris Christie, which is unprecedented in the history of the EDA,\u201d Lesniak told the Guardian in an interview on Friday. Such awards have \u201ca dangerous appearance that needs to be addressed\u201d, he said. \u201cThere have been news articles totalling how much money was given to places like the Republican Governors Association by the people who got these subsidies,\u201d Weinberg said in an interview. She said she was acting \u201cfor the very reason that these kinds of subsidies have been publicised, and it\u2019s suggested that sometimes they have something to do with political contributions\u201d. A draft copy of the bill was provided to the Guardian by staff for both state senators. It says that businesses in receipt of a public subsidy worth $25,000 or more \u2013 or any \u201cofficer, director, key employee, or principal employee\u201d of those businesses \u2013 may not \u201cdirectly or indirectly, pay or contribute any money or thing of value\u201d to a political candidate or political party in the state. It also outlaws subsidy recipients from making financial contributions to \u201cany group, committee, or association organised in support of that candidate or political party\u201d, indicating that donations to national campaign groups that give external funds to candidates in New Jersey would also be covered by the plan. Under the bill, any business caught breaking the proposed legislation could receive a fine of the same value as the subsidy that it received from the state. It could also be barred from receiving future public subsidies and state contracts for goods or services for up to five years. Political candidates are banned under the bill from soliciting campaign contributions from businesses that are in receipt of state subsidies, or their executives. They would face the same penalties as contributors themselves if they were to be caught doing so. However it did not appear on Friday that companies or people who had made political contributions in the past would be blocked under the proposal from applying for or being awarded public subsidies. An existing law against so-called \u201cpay to play\u201d bars companies from being awarded state contracts for goods or services worth $17,500 or more if they have made political contributions in the preceding four years. The proposal was welcomed by Good Jobs First, a thinktank that monitors corporate subsidies by state authorities. \u201cWith recent revelations about enormous transfers of taxpayer dollars to companies that have given to governor Christie and his pet causes, New Jersey has stepped forward as Exhibit A for campaign finance reform being extended to economic development subsidies,\u201d said Greg LeRoy, the group\u2019s executive director. The bill must now be assigned to a committee of the state legislature. Weinberg said she hoped that at the very least, it would \u201cbegin a discussion and maybe we can get a compromise\u201d on restricting public subsidies to firms that made political contributions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
