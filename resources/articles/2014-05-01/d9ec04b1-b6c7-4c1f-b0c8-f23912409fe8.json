The arrest of two men and a woman in east Belfast was an part of a Police Service of Northern Ireland operation to counter a rise in racist attacks over the last few weeks. There have been at least five recorded incidents of racial intimidation in east Belfast including a young Roma cyclist being showered with a bag of excrement on the Newtonards Road a fortnight ago. A PSNI spokesman said the men aged 43 and 41 and a 41-year-old woman were detained in the Castlereagh area of east Belfast earlier on Tuesday. The police spokesman added: \"Detectives working as part of Operation Reiner have conducted searches in the Castlereagh area as part of their ongoing investigations into the recent increase of hate crimes being committed across Belfast. \"During the course of these searches, officers recovered a firearm, ammunition and a small quantity of suspected drugs. Two males and a female have been arrested by virtue of Section 41 of the Terrorism Act and they are currently assisting police with their enquiries.\" Given that the arrests were carried out under the Terrorism Act this indicates that detectives are exploring a possible link between the racial violence and loyalist paramilitary groups in the area specificially the Ulster Volunteer Force. Although the UVF's political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, has come out strongly against the spike in racist assaults and incidents the loyalist terror group now operates on a de-centralised level with local units acting independently from its old leadership base in Belfast's Shankill Road. The east Belfast UVF is known to include members who have been engaged in racist incidents over the last few years. The latest of these incidents happened on Tuesday morning with graffiti appearing on a gable wall, carrying a racist message against Polish immigrants. It is understood to be on a derelict property and no one was inside at the time. The PSNI pledged to continue to act against racists invovled in hate crimes in Belfast and beyond. \"Our priority in the coming weeks and months will be enforcement - arrests, searches and charges - to reassure victimised communities that we can act quickly and effectively, and provide a deterrent to people engaged in this criminality. \"However, hate crime is an under-reported crime and as a result, we need to ensure victims have the confidence to report these incidents.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
