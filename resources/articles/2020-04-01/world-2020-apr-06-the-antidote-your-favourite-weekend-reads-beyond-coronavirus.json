He had promised her parents in Samoa she would be educated in New Zealand but instead found herself cooking, cleaning and looking after his children. Her day started at 4am and often didn\u2019t finish until 11pm. \u2018Working with him was all adrenaline\u2019: Rory Bremner on writer John Langdon \u201cYou may not know the name John Langdon, who died on 23 March, but you\u2019ll very probably have laughed at his jokes. When the story of BBC Radio Light Entertainment is written, his legend will feature large, not least because he wrote the famous sketch about Derek Jameson (\u201ca man who thinks erudite is a type of glue\u201d) for which the tabloid editor sued the BBC and lost. But to me, he was my best friend, my greatest encourager and, for over 35 years, my constant writing partner.\u201d Paul McCartney: where to start in his solo back catalogue In Listener\u2019s Digest, our writers help you explore the work of great musicians. In this instalment, John Harris considers the post-Beatles career of Sir Paul McCartney. \u201cWhen the music coheres, you can hear the same boundless sensibilities that defined the long medley on Abbey Road, and a talent who could make magic out of the most unlikely ingredients.\u201d My favourite game: Wales v England, Five Nations 1999 \u201cTom Jones leads the choir with a lusty Bread of Heaven, stood alongside that cheeky bard of the valleys Max Boyce. The feeling shared among the Welsh is that something is afoot, that Graham Henry\u2019s men could poop the party and deny England a grand slam at the site of their footballing brethren\u2019s greatest sporting triumph, 1966 and all that. How wonderful that would be \u2026\u201d Human remains found at former home of jailed Yorkshire stalker \u201cFor the past four days there has been a heavy police presence at the former home of Kenneth Ward. Ward, 72, was jailed in 2011 for indecent exposure and weapons offences after police found a huge haul of weapons including a loaded Luger pistol under his pillow and the cockpit of a second world war fighter plane with working machine guns at his remote cottage.\u201d Saturday 4 April I was assaulted at 18. Eleven years on, could I find out what happened to my attackers? \u201cIn 2017, I was invited to a residency in Lisbon. To cover the fee, I applied for a small literary grant. In my application, I wrote that the residency would give me the opportunity to present my work \u2018within an international context\u2019 for the first time. None of this was technically a lie. But it wasn\u2019t the whole truth, either. My reason for being in Lisbon was to find court documents related to a sexual assault that had been committed against me in the city 11 years earlier, when I was 18 years old.\u201d Fabio Capello: \u2018I asked the players \u2013 Joe Hart or Calamity James?\u2019 \u201cThe England shirt weighs heavy. So much time has passed without winning. \u201966 is a problem because whenever a World Cup or Euros starts, they think they can do it again. Always, always, always. It\u2019s important to play without that weight, with more freedom. A lot is psychology but, honestly, I think the problem England have is they arrive at tournaments tired. You play a lot of [club] games and your culture is: fight, fight, fight, never stop, even if you\u2019re four down. I liked that.\u201d Keeping up with the Sussexes: will Harry and Meghan be LA\u2019s hottest ticket? \u2018As soon as the city kicks back into business again, the couple are expected to shoot to the top of everybody\u2019s invite lists. \u201cUltimately, this is a city where royalty trumps celebrity,\u201d says Melanie Bromley, chief news correspondent and head of news operations for E!. \u201cThey are potentially the most famous residents of Los Angeles \u2013 or at least they\u2019re on the same level as Oprah, as that kind of celebrity, AAA list.\u201d\u2019 \u2018Circular economy\u2019: the tannery making leather from billy goats \u201cThe leather industry is so misunderstood. People don\u2019t think about where leather comes from, but it\u2019s a natural by-product. The connection between the meat and dairy system and the leather industry has been forgotten, but they are inextricably linked. We\u2019re repurposing a bi-product that comes from an inherently wasteful food system to make a material that\u2019s biodegradable, natural and beautiful.\u201d \u2018I\u2019ve had to sleep with the entire legal team\u2019: Joe Lycett on making TV\u2019s most risk-taking comedy \u201cI did say half-jokingly when we launched that I wanted to destroy capitalism with this programme. Give us one more series and capitalism will probably have destroyed itself by then. We\u2019ll just be doing the clearing up.\u201d Sunday 5 April How \u2018tenacious, diligent\u2019 Starmer won over a shell-shocked party Keir Starmer securing the Labour leadership was undoubtedly yesterday\u2019s key topic beyond coronavirus, with readers clearly wanting a deeper understanding of the victor. Yesterday\u2019s list contained four Starmer pieces in the top five. I\u2019ve pulled the others together here to give a little more variety to the list over all. What Starmer can learn from four Labour leaders Starmer won handsomely. Now he must convince the nation Three key appointments: Starmer fills top shadow cabinet roles The Marquess of Bath obituary \u201cAn imposing figure with flowing shoulder-length hair and a straggly beard, colourful waistcoats, shirts and trousers, often topped with a fez, he was a tabloid favourite, not only for his picturesque appearance and peculiar artistic tastes but for his string of mistresses, whom he referred to as his wifelets (he reckoned there to have been around 74 of them). He painted portraits of 69 of them and decorated a staircase at Longleat with them \u2013 one visitor remarked that the paintings all looked the same.\u201d Book lifts lid on \u2018guerrilla warfare\u2019 against Pope Francis \u2018An influential conservative cardinal has established himself as a \u201cparallel authority\u201d to Pope Francis, according to a new book that depicts the pontiff as a prophetic reformer who is surrounded by opponents waging \u201cguerrilla warfare\u201d against him.\u2019 Front Row at the Trump Show review: Jonathan Karl\u2019s pre-pandemic warning \u2018Karl writes that Trump told the meeting the Charlottesville protesters were unfairly treated and most had \u2018good\u2019 intentions, driven to the streets by opposition to the removal of a statue of Lee. The infamous tiki torch parade \u2013 and its chants of \u2018Jews will not replace us\u2019 \u2013 never really registered on his radar.\u201d Claire Danes on the end of Homeland: \u2018It was so nice to play such a badass\u2019 \u201cWe worked with the intelligence community over the years, and I\u2019ve been playing somebody within it. It was hard not to feel real empathy and deep appreciation and loyalty. So when suddenly they were dismissed and undermined by a president, it was just so hard to believe.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
