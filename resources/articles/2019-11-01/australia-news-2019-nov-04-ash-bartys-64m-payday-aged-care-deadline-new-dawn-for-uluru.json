For the Australian crime writer Gary Disher book signings are a mix of delight and trepidation. Berated by elderly psychiatrists, constantly asked \u201cHow can you write about such terrible things\u201d or worst of all \u2013 ignored entirely while long queues snake out the door for Ian Rankin. \u201cShould I have to account for myself? Do I have obligations beyond entertaining readers, giving them their money\u2019s worth? \u2026 as far as I know, no one has committed a crime after reading one of my books.
