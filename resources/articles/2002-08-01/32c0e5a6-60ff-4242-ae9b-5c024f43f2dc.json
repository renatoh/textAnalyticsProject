Currently top of the Argentinian league, which they have won on 15 occasions in its various guises, Boca maintained their selling tradition by recently exporting their star striker Roman Riquelme to Barcelona. The club's hopes for the coming year are pinned mainly on 18-year-old Carlitos \"Caco\" Tevez, a player who emerged from the lower ranks of the club. Tevez, who grew up in a Buenos Aires slum, is one of the few Boca players who has had a taste of playing in England before. He scored a remarkable goal against England at Wembley in an Under-16 international in 1999. Tevez's partner up front is likely to be Ezequiel Gonzalez, just arrived from nearby Rosario Central. So far the pair seem to understand each other well and say they enjoy playing together. Also central to the coach Oscar Tabarez's strategy are Diego Crosa and Nicolas Burdisso, two central markers who have both been world champions with Argentina's Under-20 team, while the midfield is based around Sebastian Battaglia. Many of the players have come up through the club, something the Boca president Maurici Macri vowed to concentrate on when he took over some seven years ago. Macri, a young businessman with a passion for football and politics, intends to follow his modernisation of the club's finances with an attempt to do the same for the country itself; he has ambitions to run for president of Argentina. Boca Juniors like to boast they have a fan base of \"half plus one\" of Argentina's population, and their colourful and passionate supporters echo the romantic folklore of the neighbourhood where the club is based. Literally on the edges of the \"mouth\" of the River Plate (Boca means mouth in Spanish) the club's founders pledged to adopt the colours of the first ship to sail into the port. A Swedish merchant vessel is responsible for their distinctive blue and gold strip. Tabarez, who guided the club to the local title in 1992, is looking forward to the challenge of taking on Manchester United. \"Playing against one of the best teams in the world is useful in terms of prestige, of course,\" he said. \"But I cannot think of football without thinking of results. To me the result always matters.\" This is Boca's fourth high-profile international match in less than two years. They beat Real Madrid to lift the Toyota Intercontinental Trophy in 2000, and lost the same title in the final last year when they were defeated by Bayern Munich in Tokyo. They played a friendly against Roma in Italy and now they face the world's \"richest club\", as the Argentinian press have promoted Manchester United, in a game that will be televised live back home. As for United, they are treating the match largely as a warm-up for their first leg, third qualifying round Champions League tie against Zalaegerszegi in Budapest on Wednesday. Paul Scholes, who was flown home injured from last weekend's trip to Ajax, is likely to feature after coming safely through a midweek reserve match at Chester and the Old Trafford club are playing down reports that Fabien Barthez could miss out with a bruised thigh muscle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
