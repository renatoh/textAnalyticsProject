Jon Trickett, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, told the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, that the comments amounted to a \u201ctotally unwarranted and indeed unconstitutional political intervention, with disturbing implications for our democratic system\u201d. Corbyn and his party have rejected the claims made in the Times on Saturday, which said that, at a recent event, senior civil servants had discussed their worries about what might happen if the Labour leader became prime minister. The report cited anonymous senior civil servants who warned that they were concerned about Corbyn being put into Downing Street after an election as he seemed to lack a firm grasp of issues and was being \u201cpropped up\u201d by his advisers. One was quoted as saying: \u201cThere is a real worry that the Labour leader isn\u2019t up to the job physically or mentally but is being propped up by those around him. There\u2019s growing concern that he\u2019s too frail and is losing his memory. He\u2019s not in charge of his own party.\u201d Corbyn has called for an investigation, saying it was \u201cvery concerning\u201d for officials to brief against an elected politician. In his letter to Sedwill, Trickett wrote: \u201cDiscussion of these matters, based on false assumptions, should not be taking place. Worse, it is without precedent in my experience that any high-level discussion about senior politicians, let alone the leader of the opposition, should be shared with a newspaper. \u201cI must now formally say to you that it is hard to avoid the conclusion that this has been a totally unwarranted and indeed unconstitutional political intervention with disturbing implications for our democratic system. \u201cThere clearly needs to be an investigation into what appears to have been a breach of civil service neutrality, independent of the Cabinet Office, in order to avoid any real or apparent conflicts of interest.\u201d Trickett also said he wanted a meeting with Sedwill to discuss the matter, and to get \u201cclear assurances that the basic principles of British public life will not be undermined\u201d. Earlier on Sunday Len McCluskey, the leader of the Unite union and a close associate of Corbyn, told BBC One\u2019s Andrew Marr show that he believed the comments could have been entirely made up by the journalists concerned. \u201cThey ought to be ashamed of themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was fake news. It was lies. It was distortion. \u201cJeremy Corbyn is fit as a fiddle. He is one of the strongest people I have ever met \u2013 people 20 years younger struggle to keep up with him. I don\u2019t believe them at all. It\u2019s the Murdoch press. Of course they are going to attack and try to undermine Jeremy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
