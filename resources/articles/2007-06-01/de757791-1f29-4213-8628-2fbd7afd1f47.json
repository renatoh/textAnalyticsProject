Five days after John McBeth, the former president, created a host of negative publicity with outspoken remarks against the English, African countries and Caribbean countries, comments which saw him replaced as a vice-president of Fifa before even taking up the role, Smith spoke positively about the future of the game north of the border. The Scottish international team's midweek victory in Austria has, in truth, barely registered amid the chaos. \"I feel privileged and honoured,\" said Smith, who conceded he did not even think he was a genuine contender for the post at the final interview stage. \"I am a proud Scot who wants to see Scottish football flourish. The response I've had already from within the game has been marvellous, and that has given me extra motivation.\" News of the 52-year-old Smith's imminent appointment was met with surprise when it broke in midweek. A former Kilmarnock, Rangers and Brighton striker, Smith worked most recently as an agent and an analyst for BBC Scotland. His new role, which he will take up formally by July 1, carries a salary of \u00a3200,000; some 25% more than his predecessor, David Taylor, earned before moving to become Uefa's general secretary. \"I will make less money than I was doing before,\" Smith added. \"Which hopefully demonstrates commitment on my part. I could have earned more outside the game but I am a great believer in giving yourself fresh challenges in life. This puts me outside the comfort zone.\" Smith is a keen advocate of a two-month winter break in Scotland, a matter which has seen him submit written proposals to the Premierleague in the past. However, with the SPL an autonomous body, he faces a major challenge in implementing reconstruction - Smith also wants to see a 16-team top division - in the near future. Smith said: \"I would love to see a bigger league but would the clubs vote for it? Self-interest is a major motivation, I understand that.\" Rangers' punishments by Uefa because of sectarian chanting by fans and the SFA's growing involvement in the same issue is of crucial importance. Smith is a self-confessed Rangers supporter, but those of a light-blue persuasion who think he will pander to them and Celtic followers who fear similar bias will be disappointed. The new chief executive is a fair-minded individual who has never demonstrated prejudice in the past. \"I honestly don't know why anybody would think otherwise,\" said Smith. \"I actually spoke to the Rangers Supporters' Trust and told them that fans should not be singing sectarian songs. I agree that Uefa should punish offensive chants. Anybody who knows me, knows I am not a bigot in any sense.\" The promotion of Peat, a former director of Airdrieonians, from treasurer was more widely predicted. Peat has made little attempt to smooth relations with world football's governing body after the outcry over McBeth. The Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, claimed McBeth's words had brought shame on Scottish football but Peat replied: \"Some of John's comments were ill-advised but he is not a racist and never has been. We hear statements from Fifa all the time, most of which we ignore.\" At a busy SFA annual general meeting yesterday, McBeth was made the honorary vice-president while a proposal to allow up to four junior clubs to play in the Scottish Cup from next season was passed. Meanwhile, the Saint Johnstone manager, Owen Coyle, is the leading contender to take on the same position at Motherwell, following the sacking of Maurice Malpas. The former Dundee United defender lasted just a single season at Fir Park after replacing Terry Butcher and the final weeks of Malpas's reign were plagued by supporter protests as his team flirted with relegation. The former Motherwell midfielder Scott Leitch has been placed in temporary charge, but will not be considered for the job on a full-time basis. Gary McAllister, another former Motherwell player, may, however, come into contention. Partick Thistle's new manager, Ian McCall, has signed three players from the Premierleague. The midfielder Ryan McStay and defender Mark Twaddle both turned down new contracts with Falkirk, and the goalkeeper Craig Hinchcliffe rejected the chance to stay at St Mirren. All three were keen to play regular first-team football and will improve their chances by stepping down into the First Division."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
