The results of a survey in the current issue of PR Week magazine found that despite 89% of 22- to 25-year-olds saying they could still see themselves working in the industry a year from now, the figure dropped to 66% when asked if they were likely to be in PR five years down the line. Almost half said they wanted to work in other marketing disciplines, prompting soul searching among consultancy bosses about how to make PR more attractive. If they don't know, who does? Degree of vulnerability A study by Direct Line has pinpointed young graduates who live in rented accommodation as being one of the groups most at risk of being burgled. University debts often mean they end up living in less salubrious areas and can't afford to insure their belongings. The company found that 39% of young renters fall into the \"risky renter\" category, opting to forgo insurance to save money. One in 12 renters assume their possessions are covered by their landlord's policy, but most aren't, which means many renters, and new graduates in particular, are exposing themselves to \"unnecessary economic hardship and expense for the sake of a few pounds a month\", says Andrew Lowe, head of home insurance at Direct Line. Fatal attraction The University of Bath announced this week that it is planning to launch a masters degree in death and society. The announcement coincides with the opening today of the UK's first research centre devoted to the study of dying. The centre, based at the university, will focus on research into attitudes to death, dying, grief and bereavement. Not one for the faint-hearted. Contributions welcome Saddled with debts from three years of studying, graduates won't be pleased to learn that they need to start thinking seriously about their pensions now if they want to reap the rewards later. According to research by HSBC, graduates could halve their future pension funds if they don't start contributing now. Ian Martin, a senior pensions manager at the bank, says even paying a small amount into a pension scheme could make all the different in retirement. A monthly contribution of \u00a375 - about 4% of the average monthly salary for graduates starting work this year - would do for starters, and with increased contributions in line with yearly pay rises, graduates could end up with a pension fund of \u00a3338,000 (about \u00a323,000 a year), twice what they'd get if they wait until they are 30 to start making contributions. Net gains All of which could make you wish you'd been as smart as Alex Tew, who's about to start his degree at Nottingham University. Not wanting to follow in the footsteps of his older brother, who graduated from university \u00a330,000 in debt, the clever lad from Wiltshire has launched the milliondollarhomepage.com website, which he hopes will net him $1m by the time he graduates. The website is divided into boxes, each 100 pixels in size. Companies can buy their own pixel for $1 on which to advertise. What's he planning to study at university? Business studies, of course."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
