Nikolai Anisimov, her long-standing trainer, took the coach of the year award. The honours came at the end of a highly lucrative and turbulent year for the controversial 29-year-old Yegorova, who sparked a media storm after testing positive for the blood-booster erythropoietin at the Paris Golden League meeting in July. She was initially suspended from the world championships in Canada but was later cleared to compete on a technicality - Yegorova called it a \"flawed result\" - as the test did not conform to International Olympic Committee standards. Yegorova's dramatic recent improvement, which earned her a share of the 50kg of gold awarded to athletes who win at five out of the seven Golden League meetings, has inevitably caused suspicion and resentment but she has always denied using the drug. She broke the European 5,000m record at the final meeting of the elite series. Meanwhile, the Association of Tennis Professionals yesterday warned of the dangers of dietary supplements after suspending the 19-year-old Argentine Guillermo Coria from Tour events for seven months and fining him some \u00a370,000 for testing positive in April for the banned steroid nandrolone at a Barcelona tournament."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
