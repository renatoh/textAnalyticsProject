Would that I had my grandmother Ginny\u2019s work ethic. She spent most of her time there, doing little and living larger. My grandparents moved to Italy in 1952, seeking a rest cure for Ginny\u2019s recurrent tuberculosis. My grandfather John was a writer and gallerist, my grandmother a Broadway and Hollywood starlet and painter. Arriving in Rome they found themselves surrounded by friends old and new. It is incredible to hear my mum recall their names \u2013 Ginny died not so long ago \u2013 but suffice to say that Fellini\u2019s La Dolce Vita was inspired by Ginny and Grandpa, and specifically a party they threw. They are Steiner and his wife in the film, and Ginny\u2019s paintings adorn the walls of the infamous party scene, her guests Fellini\u2019s extras. That scene was their life in Rome and, for sanity, a regular antidote was essential. They bought an apartment in an isolated fishing village, Sperlonga, a couple of hours to the south. We still own it, but the town is no longer remote: connected by the Via Flacca, it is now a mecca for Roman and Neapolitan youth in the summer. The evening fish market in Gaeta(the town where Ginny, fresh from a plumbing course she took God-knows-why, repaired her friend Gore Vidal\u2019s toilet), butchers (little hole-in-the-walls on Gaeta\u2019s Via dell\u2019Indipendenza or the carnal temple that is Scherzerino in Itri) and greengrocers (none better than Poco Poco in Sperlonga) have produce that cries out to be cooked \u2013 simply \u2013 and eaten. This is the swamp Mussolini drained, leaving the most fertile land in Italy for tomatoes, courgettes, aubergines, melons, figs and peaches. This is the sea of grey mullet and gurnard, pink bream, black cuttlefish and red prawns. It is the sea Odysseus sailed \u2013 my balcony overlooks the false island, Circeo, thought to be Aeaea, where the goddess Circe turned Odysseus\u2019s crew to pigs. It is the sea of my childhood, which I cannot return to often enough. APERITIVO White wine and peach punch In Italy it is not uncommon to steep a peach in wine. It\u2019s not entirely obvious whether this is for the benefit of the peach or the vino but both seem to like it. Makes enough for 1 fresh ripe peach \u00bd, cut into segments (skin on, unless it bothers you) white wine \u00bd a bottle mint or basil a sprig (optional) ice soda water (optional) Steep the peach in the wine for at least half an hour, but up to half a day, in the fridge. Serve it over ice, with the mint or basil submerged if you fancy it, and top with a mere splash of soda water. Italian Pimms. Drink the wine, then fish the peach from your glass and eat that too. Olives, walnuts and rosemary Aperitivo time is a time to nibble. Very crunchy salted crisps, peanuts and taralli, Italy\u2019s answer to the pretzel, are the norm, as are a few slices of pecorino and dried local sausage. Olives are on the table, too. Mixed with walnuts and rosemary, they make for a surprisingly complete moment on their own, or alongside a glass of something cold and fizzy. Serves 4 stone-in olives 150g (look for gaeta or cerignola) walnuts 75g, lightly candied, lightly roasted or raw rosemary 1 good sprig, leaves picked lemon 1 wedge, cut into very small fragments extra virgin olive oil 2 tbsp Toss everything together. Eat alongside your drinks. ANTIPASTO Aubergines \u2018a funghetto\u2019 A wonderful woman, Leontina, helped Ginny look after my mother when she was a baby. She helped my mum with me when I was tiny, then did the same when my sister was born 10 years later. A few years ago, when she was still well enough to travel, Leontina came down from the convent to which she had retired and met us all in Rome. We drove with her to Sperlonga and she made two things I remember particularly well. She made a magnificent tomato sauce (see note below), and she did something fiendish with aubergines. Later, I discovered these were aubergines \u2018a funghetto\u2019 \u2013 cooked as one might cook mushrooms. Serves 4 or more as an antipasto or side aubergines 1kg (violet are best), cut in 2cm chunks extra virgin olive oil 80ml ripe plum or San Marzano tomatoes 600g, cut in 2cm chunks garlic 2 cloves, halved basil 12 leaves, torn Heat a non-stick or well seasoned, very wide pan over a high heat. Add the aubergines and half the oil at the same time. Stir occasionally until just starting to brown (10-15 minutes). Push the aubergines to one side. Add the tomatoes, garlic and remaining oil and fry for a couple of minutes. Lower the heat right down, stir everything together and add generous salt plus a little pepper. Make sure to cook in a single layer and stir very occasionally \u2013 every 5 minutes or so \u2013 or rather, gently turn in the pan. Cook like this for a good hour, or even more, until the tomatoes and aubergines are largely intact yet meltingly tender, all the liquid evaporated. Take off the heat. While still hot, stir in the basil, then let the dish cool to room temperature. Serve with firm brown bread or toasted white bread as an antipasto, a snack or a side. NOTE: The way Leontina made her tomato sauce was almost brutal in its simplicity. She took perhaps a kilo of tomatoes (good, ripe ones \u2013 halved, keeping seeds, skins and all), a finger of oil, a small onion (halved), and I think some whole garlic cloves. Everything was raw. She set the pot to simmer for half an hour with salt and pepper (or chilli), then blended the lot. It was one of the most delicious sauces I have ever tasted. Saut\u00e9 of clams and mussels Some foods are the subject of much debate in their hometown, especially if that hometown is in Italy. What to argue about in a saut\u00e9 of shellfish? How much oil? Chilli? Tomato? Wine? Parsley? What is the best tasting bivalve? You might have a preference for clams or mussels, so use one or the other (double the quantity in the recipe below). You may prefer the dish without the tomato or with regulation parsley added instead of my heretical basil, or with fresh chilli or the conventional splash of wine. Cook it your way, and it\u2019ll come out just fine. Serves 4 as a starter live clams 750g live mussels 750g extra virgin olive oil 6 tbsp garlic 2 cloves, thinly sliced crushed dried chilli flakes 1 pinch cherry tomatoes 6, quartered, or 1 regular one in 1cm dice basil 8 leaves Sort through the clams and discard any with broken or empty shells, or open ones which refuse to close when tapped on the table. Beard the mussels, discarding any with broken or empty shells or open ones which refuse to close when tapped on the table. Heat a big, wide, heavy pan over a high heat. At the same time, add the clams, half the oil, the garlic and the chilli. Cook, with the lid on, for 1 minute. Add the mussels and tomatoes, and some black pepper if you fancy. Cook, with the lid on, for 2-3 minutes, shaking the pan every so often. Peek under the lid. When about half the shellfish have opened, start picking out the fully open ones and place them in a serving bowl. Keep the rest cooking, removing the opened ones to the serving bowl until the very last has opened (or has refused to, in which case, discard it). Tear the basil leaves and stir into the sauce with the remaining olive oil. Pour this sauce over the bowlful of cooked clams and mussels. Serve with crusty bread. NOTE: To turn this into a primo (starch course), boil 500g dried spaghetti or spaghettini until al dente, and toss it in with the cooked shellfish and their juices just before serving. PRIMO Rigatoni with ricotta and guanciale It is worth seeking out fresh ricotta if you can; an Italian deli in the UK might have it, or get some if you go on holiday to Italy. Seek out sheep\u2019s milk for the best flavour \u2013 they make it in the Dolomites, Sardinia and southern Italy. This recipe is one I made up in Sperlonga, where we normally eat ricotta every day. For breakfast or lunch, or dinner\u2019s antipasto, room temperature with oil and rocket and bread; stuffed into courgette flowers; baked into a dessert or whipped with sugar and served with strawberries. Or in pasta. Serves 4 rigatoni 400g (or penne rigati or tortiglioni) ricotta 250g, preferably sheep\u2019s milk freshly ground black pepper 1 full tsp parmesan or pecorino romano 100g, grated guanciale 150g, cut into 5mm lardons, or pancetta cut the same way (for pancetta, which is less fatty, add also 2 tbsp olive oil Have ready a large pan of boiling, well-salted water, 10-12g salt per litre. Put the pasta on to boil. In a large bowl, whisk together the ricotta, pepper and half the grated cheese with a ladleful of the pasta water, until it\u2019s the texture of thick cream. Settle this bowl on the pasta pot, like a lid, to warm it. In a wide frying pan over a high heat, fry the guanciale (no oil \u2013 it has enough fat of its own) for 3-5 minutes, until it\u2019s crispy outside but still juicy within. When cooked, but al dente, drain the pasta and reserve a bowlful of its water. Toss the pasta in the guanciale and its cooking fat. Add the lot to the warmed ricotta mixture, stir to coat, and add a little more water if it gets claggy. Serve with the remaining grated cheese on top. NOTE: Guanciale is cured pig\u2019s cheek and jowl, like an \u00fcber-bacon, which is very fatty and piggy and spesh. For a vegetarian version of this dish, at least as flavoursome, omit it (and omit steps 4 and 6) and instead whisk into the ricotta 8 basil leaves (chopped), grated zest of 1 lemon, \u215b of a nutmeg (grated), and 3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil. SECONDO Baked bream with tomatoes, olives and rosemary Bream is a lovely, clean, white-fleshed fish. You can use any smallish white fish \u2013 bass or snapper or gurnard \u2013 whatever is freshest and most appealing. Beautiful fish should not be messed with. Serves 4 whole fish 1.5kg, very fresh, scaled and gutted (any number of fish but keep them whole) sea salt 25g baby plum tomatoes 800g, datterino are best, halved extra virgin olive oil 5 tbsp black olives 100g, stone-in and drained (gaeta if possible, otherwise kalamata or similar) rosemary 2 sprigs white wine 2 tbsp Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. An hour or two before cooking, take the fish from the fridge. Inspect it for tenacious scales and rinse the belly. Rub it inside and out with half the salt. Let it come to room temperature. An hour or so (or more) before you plan to eat, toss the tomatoes with 4 tablespoons of the oil, spread them on a wide oven tray and bake for 25 minutes until condensed \u2013 you can do this ahead if you like. Take the tomatoes from the oven and scatter with the olives and rosemary. Lay the fish on top. Sprinkle with the wine and the remaining salt. Bake the fish \u2013 one 1-1.5kg beast will take 40 minutes (ish), roughly 750g fishes will take 30 minutes, and 400-600g specimens about 20 minutes. Test for doneness. You can use a food thermometer \u2013 you want an internal temperature of 55C \u2013 or test by gently pressing the fish with a finger; springy is underdone, just giving is perfect, firm or mushy is overdone. (Meaty fish goes firm, delicate fish goes mushy.) Or you can lift open the belly cavity with the tip of a knife and see if the flesh will \u2013 just \u2013 separate from the spine. Drizzle with the remaining oil and serve. Pan-fried greens If one thing gives me the greatest joy to eat it\u2019s a plate of properly cooked, totally tender, still vibrant and verdant greens. There are only two ways to serve them. Either boiled properly in plenty of well-salted water, refreshed and squeezed dry, then served room temperature with lemon and good olive oil. Or, as here, pan-fried with garlic and chilli. Serves 4 greens 1kg, cicoria (bitter green chicory), spinach, fine-stemmed chard or escarole extra virgin olive oil 4 tbsp garlic 1 large clove, thinly sliced crushed dried chilli 1 pinch Prepare the greens and wash them thoroughly. Cut them into large (10cm) pieces. Put a large pan of very well-salted water on to boil (as for pasta, 12g salt per litre). Boil the greens until they just lose any hint of crunch, so they are tender but still green. Drain, refresh in a colander under running water, and squeeze dry. Heat a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the oil and garlic at the same time. Fry until some of the garlic just begins to brown at the edges. Add the chilli, then straightaway the boiled greens. Reduce the heat to low and pan-fry, stirring, for 10 minutes or so until you are satisfied with the flavour. Salad with lemon dressing My wonderful mum makes wonderful salad. It is lemony and refreshing and simple. She sometimes serves it as we sit down, sometimes with the main, sometimes after, but it is always our favourite part of the meal. Serves 4 lemon 1 large and very juicy garlic 1 clove very good extra virgin olive oil 5 tbsp salt 1 tsp freshly ground pepper \u00bc tsp lettuce 1 large and very beautiful \u2013 round lettuce, romano (cos/romaine) or escarole Zest the lemon \u2013 use a potato peeler for a delicate dressing or a grater for a punchier one. Squeeze the lemon juice and crush the garlic. Stir together the lemon zest and juice, garlic, oil and seasoning. Wash the lettuce and spin it properly dry. Dress it and serve immediately. PUDDING Double torta caprese Capri is an ancient island of two halves, Capri and Anacapri. There are two types of visitor to the island: the raucous daytripping tourist and the vulgar bejewelled billionaire. There are two Capresi dishes: the caprese salad (tomato, mozzarella, basil) and the caprese cake (almond cake). And there are two caprese cakes: lemon and chocolate. Both sides of the island are beautiful, both visitors make for extremely entertaining people-watching, both Capresi dishes are delicious and both cakes are irresistible. Trying to have the best of both worlds, I make a torta caprese in two layers, dark and light. The lemon and chocolate cakes, united by almond, go beautifully together. Making two in one is double the effort, and you may be just as happy if you double the quantities of one mix, omitting the other. Serves 10-12 For the lemon layer blanched almonds 125g cornflour 20g caster sugar 125g eggs 2 large egg yolk 1 large unsalted butter 100g, softened lemon finely grated zest and juice of 1 decent limoncello 50ml baking powder 1 tsp For the chocolate layer blanched almonds 125g bitter chocolate 100g, chilled and broken into pieces cocoa powder 25g eggs 2 large, separated caster sugar 90g vanilla extract \u00bd tsp lemon finely grated zest of 1 small unsalted butter 100g, melted To serve icing sugar strawberries 100g per person, sliced, or whole wild strawberries caster sugar \u00bd tsp lemon juice a small squeeze Have ready a 23-24cm round cake tin, the bottom greased and lined with ovenproof paper. A loaf tin is another decent way to go. Making two cakes in one requires part-baking the first layer so it doesn\u2019t mix with the second, before baking both together. Preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Make the lemon mixture first. Grind the almonds finely with the cornflour and 25g of the sugar in a food processor. Whisk the whole eggs and egg yolk with the remaining sugar until pale, thick and fluffy. Combine with the ground almond mixture and all the other lemon cake ingredients. Fold together until just incorporated, pour into the lined baking tin and level approximately with the back of your spoon. Par-bake for 12-15 minutes until semi-set. While the lemon cake is baking, quickly make the chocolate mixture: grind the almonds, chocolate and cocoa powder in a food processor, as finely as you can without the chocolate melting and clumping the lot together. Whisk the egg yolks with the sugar, vanilla and lemon zest until very thick and pale. Add the chocolate and almond mixture. Start to stir \u2013 the mixture will be so thick it won\u2019t come together, so add the melted butter to help it along. Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks and fold them gently into the cake mix. Take the half-cooked lemon cake from the oven. Spoon the chocolate mixture over the top, and smooth it gently as best you can. Return the tin to the oven for another 30 minutes, until just set. Remove it from the oven and leave to cool partially, about 15 minutes, before unmoulding onto a plate. When cooled to room temperature, dust the top with icing sugar before you slice it. Toss the strawberries with the caster sugar and a drop of lemon juice, to serve alongside.
