The bad blood came from pronouncements by I\u00f1\u00e1rritu on his Mexico city radio show that the Mexican university he'd dropped out of was staffed by mediocre teachers. As a teacher at the self-same college (albeit one who'd never taught I\u00f1\u00e1rritu), Arriaga was understandably unimpressed. \"So when one day a mutual friend came to me and said you have to meet this guy, I told him 'fuck you'.\" But they got over it, and met up to discuss whether Arriaga - already a reasonably successful novelist - would write a screenplay for the director, who had an idea for a comedy. Arriaga said he didn't know about that, but he did have an idea for a film about dogfights. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu said fair enough, let's shoot that one instead. The resulting film helped put Mexican cinema on the map. It won a Bafta for best foreign film, attracted critical superlatives by the bucketload, and drew enough attention to Latin American cinema to make hits of the films that followed it, such as Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n and the Brazilian City of God. But for all that, Arriaga points out that neither Amores Perros nor Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n made a profit in Mexico, because of an unhelpful distribution system which rewards producers with just 20% of the box office. This, and controversial withdrawal of state help, have left the \"booming\" Mexican film industry in steep decline. \"First of all,\" says Arriaga, \"there is no Mexican film industry. And yet the Mexican cinema audience is the fasest growing audience in the world. It's a shame.\" No surprise, then, that like Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, Arriaga and Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu have left Mexico behind for their next project, 21 Grams. Like Amores Perros, 21 Grams tells the story of three otherwise unrelated people whose lives collide because of a car accident. The title comes from an urban myth - Arriaga says he picked it up from a scientific magazine, and I\u00f1\u00e1rritu found it independently in a French novel - that we each lose 21 grams at the moment of death. But this is not about the soul or the afterlife. Instead, Arriaga's screenplay concentrates on the metaphorical idea of weight; the weight of a human life, and the weight that transfers on to those we leave behind. A study in grief, loss and guilt, 21 Grams is not a barrel of laughs. But it is - to use its own terms - wonderfully weighty. Arriaga, 45, is unapologetic about his obsession with death, describing himself as \"thanatic\", a word which barely exists in Spanish, and crops up in serious Freudian discussion in English as thanatotic, to do with death. \"I think there are two kinds of people; thanatic and erotic. And I am a thanatic, I am obsessed with death. I think contemporary societies are denying death more and more. For example, you go to the supermarket and the meat is all packaged up. This is a denial of death; you don't have any experience of killing the beast. I am a hunter, and I often get insulted for that.\" Then there's the fact that \"in modern societies we don't have the wake in the house. This is a denial.\" He picks up the bottle of Diet Coke he's been drinking. \"Diet Coke. This is a denial. You cannot be old? You cannot be bald?\" Arriaga himself is balding, but active and rangy, and despite occasional disquisitions like this one - and his priceless insistence that \"writing is a way of fighting against death\" - approachable and charming. But he is unashamedly literary, a quality that comes across in the structural complexity of his screenplays. It's some forty minutes into 21 Grams before you get any clear idea of who might be married to whom, or which order the things you've already seen might have happened in. \"One of the lessons of [Juan] Rulfo and [William] Faulkner\" - respectively, Mexican and US writers of the early 20th century notable for their non-linear narratives - \"is that every story has a way to be told. I think the way 21 Grams is told is a natural way to be told, because this is the way we tell stories on a daily basis. If I want to tell you about how I met my wife, I wouldn't talk to you about the first day I saw her, I'd tell you she's out shopping in Covent Garden looking for something for my son. My son, by the way, looks a lot like my grandmother, who was married to ...\" If that all seems charming and touching, but wholly uninformative about how he met his wife, he doesn't mind. \"I wanted the audiences to relate emotionally to the film. This sort of structure takes out the logic.\" He's untroubled at the idea that audiences are going to have to work with him. \"That doesn't worry me ... Audiences are much more intelligent than we think. I think they're beyond the capabilities of the film-maker, they're in fact more sophisticated and intelligent than we are.\" This conviction that the audience is smart leads Arriaga to believe that, increasingly, the screenwriter will become the star. \"It's happening already. I think people are waiting for the new Charlie Kaufman movie rather than worrying about who is directing it. I think most people go to David Mamet's films because of Mamet the writer, not Mamet the director. People go to films for the stories. They remember the films for the stories. And there's a huge crisis in stories and storytellers.\" If there is a gap, it's one he's working hard to fill. His current slate of projects includes a script for Tommy Lee Jones, another for Joe Carnahan, the director of last year's visceral thriller Narc, as well as the third part of his \"trilogy\" with Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu. When that, and several Mexican projects, are done, he's saving one script, about the death penalty, to direct himself. And while he says writing is \"my day job\", he still considers himself a novelist, not a screenwriter. \"I don't write screenplays. I write novels for the screen.\" \"It's funny. In Latin America they pay me twice as much for the rights to my novels than they do for a screenplay. It's so dumb, because then they have to get a screenwriter to adapt it. I'm selling them both at once. But they won't listen.\" In fact plenty of people are listening to him. He's in town for the Baftas, for which 21 Grams has a best screenplay nomination. He's got reason to be hopeful, having been honoured by the Baftas in the past, and he concedes that \"this sort of film is more accepted here than in the United States.\" But, as you'd expect, he's philosophical, if not fatalistic. \"I don't think I'll win, but then again, I've got a 20% chance.\" \u00b7 21 Grams opens in the UK on March 5. The film screens at the Screen on the Green, London N1, on Saturday February 14, accompanied by a talk by Guillermo Arriaga.
