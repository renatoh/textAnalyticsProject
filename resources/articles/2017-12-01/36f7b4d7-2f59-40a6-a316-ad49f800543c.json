The Belgium international, without a goal since May, was denied by Asmir Begovic as Palace slipped back to the bottom of the Premier League. Roy Hodgson and his players were furious at the diversion from protocol, with Milivojevic \u2013 who had scored a first-half equaliser from the spot \u2013 very much the team\u2019s first-choice penalty taker, but Benteke apologised before training on Monday and will start against Watford on Tuesday attempting to make amends. \u201cAfter the game I didn\u2019t say much to him \u2013 it was a raw moment and he was disappointed,\u201d said Hodgson. \u201cI have spoken to him today and he has spoken to the rest of the players. I am happy with the way he\u2019s reacted to it, and happy with how he explained that to the rest of the team. He had the courage to talk in front of the rest of the team, and basically apologise for not following instructions. \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t need to kick someone when they are down. You just hope the player does what Benteke has done. At the first real opportunity \u2013 not in the dressing room afterwards but this morning \u2013 he said his piece. That is strong and the correct thing to do: he makes it clear he was wrong and disobeying ranks, and apologises for that, but now he will get on with it. He played very well on Saturday, let\u2019s not forget.\u201d Palace will seek to add a striker in January with Hodgson also targeting a goalkeeper to challenge Wayne Hennessey and Juli\u00e1n Speroni. Interest has been expressed in Espanyol\u2019s Diego L\u00f3pez, 36, who made his loan move a permanent switch from Milan only over the summer. But, having initially suffered from a knee injury, he lost his place to Pau L\u00f3pez and has only played twice, in the Copa del Rey, this season. Scans on Mamadou Sakho\u2019s calf have confirmed the Frenchman suffered a tear against Bournemouth which will rule him out until the new year. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious muscle tear in his calf, so it\u2019s weeks not days,\u201d said Hodgson. \u201cWe\u2019ll miss him. When you lose a player like that, you can\u2019t be anything other than disappointed and sad.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
