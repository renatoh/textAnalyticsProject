In the Facebook chat, Clinton was asked what she would do to \u201cdismantle structural racism\u201d in the US, just days after two Democratic challengers were heckled by Black Lives Matter protesters at a progressive conference in Phoenix. Her response echoed earlier comments she has made about race and racial inequality in the country. \u201cBlack lives matter,\u201d Clinton wrote in response to a question by Washington Post journalist Wesley Lowery that referenced the conference. \u201cEveryone in this country should stand firmly behind that.\u201d Clinton proposed body cameras for all police departments, alternatives to incarceration for low-level offenders, and greater investment in early childhood education. She also called for the expansion of voting rights and universal, automatic voter registration. \u201cBlack people across America still experience racism every day,\u201d she said. \u201cSince this campaign started, I\u2019ve been talking about the work we must do to address the systemic inequities that persist in education, in economic opportunity, in our justice system. But we have to do more than talk \u2013 we have to take action.\u201d She pledged to continue talking about these issues during the campaign. On Saturday, Democratic challengers Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley were heckled and repeatedly interrupted during an appearance at the progressive Netroots Nation conference, as protesters demanded that candidates respond to the issue of police brutality, especially in minority communities. Clinton did not attend the conference. Though the Facebook chat was aimed at engaging ordinary voters, reporters took the opportunity to press the former US secretary of state on various policy points. Among the thousands of questions Clinton received, she responded to just 12 questions \u2013 four of which were posed by reporters. The Huffington Post\u2019s Laura Bassett asked her to respond to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s latest jab, in which he said: \u201cThe gender card alone isn\u2019t enough.\u201d Clinton responded: \u201cWow. If that\u2019s what he said, Mitch McConnell really doesn\u2019t get it. There is a gender card being played in this campaign. It\u2019s played every time Republicans vote against giving women equal pay, deny families access to affordable child care or family leave, refuse to let women make decisions about their health or have access to free contraception. These aren\u2019t just women\u2019s issues, they are economic issues that drive growth and affect all Americans. Anyone who doesn\u2019t get that doesn\u2019t understand what our lives are like.\u201d Clinton also confirmed, in response to a question by CNN\u2019s Dan Merica, that she will announce a proposal later this week to increase the capital gains tax \u201cto promote long term investment that will strengthen companies, workers, and communities\u201d. Clinton also took the opportunity to tackle less pressing questions. Favorite pantsuit? Like ice cream flavors, Clinton said she likes them all. \u201cI never met a pantsuit I didn\u2019t love,\u201d she wrote to Brittany Jones, who described herself as an \u201cavid follower\u201d. \u201cGo to our website and you can get one of your own,\u201d Clinton said, sharing the link for an \u201ceveryday pantsuit tee\u201d. Do you like karaoke? a user who went by Doug River Man Allen wanted to know. He extended Clinton an invite to karaoke night on Dickson Street in Fayetteville, Arkansas, where she and former president Bill Clinton had their first home. \u201cI love Dickson Street!\u201d Clinton responded, sidestepping the invite. But it was Facebook user Becky Robles who earned the most enthusiastic response. \u201cPolitical things aside,\u201d Robles asked the Democratic hopeful. \u201cGrandma feelings ... How does it feel to be a Gma?\u201d \u201cIT\u2019S THE BEST THING EVER!\u201d Clinton replied (capitals hers). After taking questions, Clinton signed off with a GIF of her SNL impersonator, Kate McKinnon, asking her assistant to \u201cmeet my hand in the air\u201d, as the gag goes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
