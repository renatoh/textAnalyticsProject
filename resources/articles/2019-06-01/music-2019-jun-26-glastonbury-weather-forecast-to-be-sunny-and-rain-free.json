Temperatures are set to reach a high of 27C on Friday at the Somerset site, cooling a little on Saturday before fresher weather on Sunday, with highs of 19C. The record Glastonbury temperature of 31.2C, set in 2017, looks likely to remain unbroken. But the heatwave that is set to bring temperatures of up to 35C in the south of England \u2013 and potentially threatening the UK\u2019s all-time record of 35.6C in Southampton in 1976 \u2013 should keep Glastonbury dry, with less than 5% chance of rain forecast for most of the weekend. Those arriving this morning were doing so under threatening clouds, though these are forecast to clear up later today. This year\u2019s festival is headlined by Stormzy, the Killers and the Cure, with Kylie, Janet Jackson, Liam Gallagher and Miley Cyrus among the hundreds of artists also appearing. The 83-year-old farmer and festival organiser, Michael Eavis, welcomed the crowds as the gates were opened. \u201cIt\u2019s never been better, it\u2019s never been as good as this one,\u201d he said. \u201cThe weather looks good \u2013 isn\u2019t that marvellous?\u201d The festival has announced it will be screening England\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup quarter-final match against Norway on Thursday, on the West Holts stage from 8pm. Another last-minute change to the schedule is that Snow Patrol were forced to pull out because band members required medical treatment for separate injuries; they have been replaced by the Charlatans."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
