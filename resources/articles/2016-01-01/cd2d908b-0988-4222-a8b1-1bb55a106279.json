The realclearpolitics.com polling average for the state, which opens the presidential primary season with its caucus on 1 February, puts Fiorina joint seventh in the 13-strong field, at 2.3% \u2013 28 percentage points behind the leader, Ted Cruz. In the same website\u2019s national average, Fiorina sits eighth, at 2.2%. Though some political experts had wondered whether such a tweet might be coming, Republican party figures seemed taken by surprise. The strategist Brian Walsh tweeted: \u201cUrgh. Who thought this tweet was a good idea?\u201d \u201cI just groaned so hard I may have pulled a muscle,\u201d tweeted former Michigan congressman John Dingell. The Rose Bowl, a traditional showpiece game at the end of the college football season, was due to kick-off in Pasadena, California, at 5pm EST. Republican presidential politics also intruded into the traditional pre-game parade, at which an unidentified skywriter emblazoned the empyrean with the words: \u201cAmerica is great! Trump is disgusting.\u201d Fiorina studied medieval history and philosophy at Stanford, and then took a master\u2019s degree in business administration at the University of Maryland. The Terrapins finished a disappointing 3-9 and last in the Big Ten East this year, sparing Fiorina the temptation of publicly siding against them in any bowl game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
