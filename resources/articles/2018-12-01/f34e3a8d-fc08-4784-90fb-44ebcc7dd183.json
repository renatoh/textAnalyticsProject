All is quiet on @realDonaldTrump though. If that changes, we\u2019ll be back... Otherwise, goodnight! GW Here\u2019s Geoffery Yu, Head of the UK Investment Office at UBS Wealth Management, on the sell-off: \u201cDespite the Fed\u2019s initial announcement to hike interest rates being broadly in line with market expectation, there was hope for it to be slightly more accommodative. Markets have subsequently struggled, following Chairman Powell\u2019s press conference. Powell\u2019s comments that \u201cpolicy does not currently need to be restrictive\u201d has been interpreted that the Fed is not looking at an immediate pause. Here\u2019s an unwelcome record for Jay Powell - he just triggered the biggest sell-off after a rate hike in almost 25 years. Capital Economics agrees that the Federal Reserve could have been rather more dovish. Here\u2019s their take: The Fed hiked the fed funds target range by 25bp today, to between 2.25% and 2.50%, as most still expected, but tempered the move by slightly revising down Fed officials\u2019 projections for additional rate increases in 2019 and beyond. Still, with the vote unanimous and the median rate projection for end-2019 revised down by only 20bp, this was hardly the \u201cdovish hike\u201d that some were anticipating. Key point: Shares aren\u2019t falling because the Fed raised interest rates. That was priced in. Instead, they\u2019re falling because chair Jerome Powell indicated that they\u2019ll keep hiking if the data justifies it......despite signs of a global slowdown. It\u2019s early days, but it looks like European stock markets are going to fall tomorrow. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is currently expected to fall around 85 points, according to the futures market at IG, near to a two-year low [reminder, it gained 64 points today] Newsflash: The US stock market has closed at its lowest level in over a year, following today\u2019s interest rate hike. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 1.5%, or 351 points, to end at 23,323 points - the lowest point since November 2017. That\u2019s a 650-point swing downward since the Fed announced its decision two hour ago. The S&amp;P 500 shed 1.4% to 2,510 points, the lowest since late September 2017, while the tech-focused Nasdaq has lost 2%. Clearly Wall Street is disappointed that the Fed expects two more rate hikes next year, on top of today\u2019s rise (which was generally expected). My colleague Dominic Rushe has covered the Fed\u2019s rate hike, and chair Powell\u2019s press conference, here: I said earlier that this was a dovish hike. Actually, it looks more like a dovish-ish one. Although the Fed has lowered its predicted path of rate increases, it has signalled that it won\u2019t be deterred by a bit of market volatility, and that it expects growth to continue next year. As Melanie Baker, senior economist, at Royal London Asset Management, puts it: The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), as expected, raised rates 25bps, with their projections implying one fewer rate rise next year. However, the signals sent in the statement and forecasts weren\u2019t as dovish as we had expected, e.g. only making a small adjustment to their language around \u201cfurther gradual\u201d hikes (by adding the word \u201csome\u201d). A more cautious signal from the Fed could have been justified (and would have been welcomed by equity markets) given the tightening in financial conditions and weaker global growth backdrop. However, the domestic economic data has looked strong enough to suggest that we aren\u2019t at the peak of the rate cycle quite yet. Bob Baur, chief global economist at Principal Global Investors, thinks the Fed is being too relaxed about recent market volatility: The Fed raised rates as expected, but I think the Fed may be underestimating other factors at play. Trade has been making headlines, but I think a gradual tightening of monetary policy has been the driving force behind recent market volatility. With corporate borrowing and spending still high, and the Fed continuing to reduce its balance sheet, I\u2019d expect volatility to remain if this tightening continues. \u201cI still think there is a disconnect between Main Street and Wall Street. A general consensus is that a market downturn signals an upcoming recession, but most underlying data points are still healthy and the economy is robust. Just the other day we saw data signalling strong consumer spending, which is one of a few points that tell me the real economy is doing well. \u201cI also think the Fed missed the significance around the tightening of financial conditions beyond their activity. The stock market is down, credit spreads are way up, bank stocks are plunging and the dollar is stronger. I think markets would have applauded the Fed signalling a pause next year to see how markets have been adjusting to their previous rate decisions. Michael McDonough of Bloomberg has pinpointed the moment when US stocks got a chill from Powell.... Finally, a question on Brexit. Jerome Powell thinks the US financial system is well-prepared for whatever happens, whether the UK leaves the US with a transition deal, or without one. But the Fed will be watching closely, as Brexit is a big issue and something that\u2019s not happened before. That\u2019s the end of the press conference. Jerome Powell reiterates that the Fed expects solid growth in 2019, with declining unemployment. That sounds like conditions that would justify further rate hikes next year, which is why shares are diving in New York. Chair Powell is having quite an impact.... The sell-off is gathering pace! Next year, the Federal Reserve will hold a press conference after every meeting (rather than every other meeting). That will be a \u201cbig gain\u201d for communication, Jerome Powell says. It also means that the Fed could raise rates more easily at any of its eight meetings (rather than resisting policy changes at non-press conference meetings) Q: Donald Trump wants you to \u2018feel the markets\u2019, so what feelings are you getting? Powell plays down the idea that he should be fixated on the stock exchange. What matters to the economy is changes in a range of markets. A little volatility doesn\u2019t leave a mark, he adds. If you speak to American companies, you hear that they\u2019re worried about growth prospects, Jerome Powell says. Stocks are now falling sharply in New York. The Dow is now down 1%, or 256 points, having been UP 300 points before the Fed\u2019s announcement. Q: Are you worried about Donald Trump\u2019s statements, and tweets, about the Fed? I\u2019m not worried, Powell replies; he knows everyone at the Fed will keep on doing their job. He explains that the Fed speaks to hundreds of people, and looks at masses of data, before setting monetary policy. Q: How can you tell if the Fed has become a drag on the economy? Powell says the Fed expects decent growth in the US economy next year, of between 2% and 2.5%. So it\u2019ll be watching the data closely to see if that plays out. Q: How did the tightening in financial conditions, trade tensions, and criticism from Donald Trump affect today\u2019s decision? Powell says the Fed took financial conditions into account, and will be watching the situation. On trade, there is \u2018broad\u2019 concern among businesses over the strength of the global economy. And on the president\u2019s criticism of the Fed, Powell insists firmly that Trump has no impact at all! Political considerations play no role in our work, Powell insists. The Fed has a mandate from Congress, and it has the tools and the independence it needs to do the job. We at the Fed are absolutely committed to that mission, and nothing will deter us from doing what we think is the right thing to do, Powell declares. There is a \u201cfairly high degree of uncertainty over the path and destination of any further interest rate increases\u201d Powell reiterates. Translation: Those two hikes expected in 2019 are NOT set in concrete. Onto questions, starting with one about recent softening in US inflation data. Chair Powell says this gives the Fed the flexibility to be patient. Jay Powell is now explaining that the Fed\u2019s future decisions aren\u2019t pre-determined. Any future policy changes will depend on the data, he says. The US dollar is bouncing around as Powell speaks.... Powell says most of his colleagues expect the US economy to perform well in the coming year. But they have cut their inflation projections, due to recent \u2018tightening in financial conditions\u2019 and slower growth abroad (the eurozone, for example, only grew by 0.2% in the last quarter, with Germany contracting) Jay Powell says that the Fed has lowered its forecast for economic growth next year. That\u2019s why it now expects two more interest rate hikes in 2019, down from 3 before. The Fed chair has arrived, to explain why US interest rates are being raised for the fourth time this year - and the 9th time since the financial crisis ended. Jerome Powell says the US economy has been performing well over the last three months, with jobs being created, wages up, and inflation stable. But there are also signs of softening, as the US economy faces new challenges such as slower growth in some other countries, Powell continues.... You can watch the press conference live, here. A nice summary: The S&amp;P 500 index - a broader measure of US company values than the Dow - is now in the red, down 0.4% at 2,536 points. That underlines that the Fed has disappointed Wall Street by not being more dovish. You can read the Fed\u2019s statement online, here. We\u2019ll hear from Jerome Powell shortly.... Reaction to the US interest rate hike is pouring in. Here\u2019s Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management: \u201cDespite Trump\u2019s misgivings the Fed was not going to be deterred from raising interest rates. In light of low unemployment and a robust economy, it was clear the central bank was led by the data in front of them. The US economy has seen some momentum slow as the positive impact of fiscal policy wanes, which will affect future policy. The Fed will be wary that upwards pressure on prices is growing from a tight labour market, higher wages and Trump\u2019s trade war. As we move into 2019, the Fed will take a flexible pragmatic approach, dependent on the economic data.\u201d Here\u2019s Kully Samra, Vice President of Charles Schwab: \u201cIt seems like the new year could equal new monetary policy for Mr Powell..... We expect that the Fed will likely continue to raise short-term interest rates in 2019, but at a slower pace than in the past with one to two hikes, and may pause or end rate hikes by mid-2019, if the yield curve flattens and inflation remains tame. We also expect the dollar to stay firm until there is evidence that the Fed is done tightening and global growth picks up. Market volatility is a theme that is likely to persist in 2019. After a decade of unprecedented liquidity provision, liquidity is draining out of the system as the Fed and other central banks move toward tighter monetary policy. Here\u2019s more reaction: The Federal Reserve has also added a line about monitoring \u201cglobal economic and financial conditions\u201d to its statement. That suggests Fed governors are more worried about the state of the world economy, and the recent volatility in the markets. The US stock market is falling sharply, losing almost all of its earlier gains. The Dow, which was up almost 300 points, is now only 39 points higher. That suggests investors had expected the Fed to be more dovish. Some in the market will be disappointed that policymakers still expect two rate hikes next year. The Fed is justifying its rate hike, by pointing out that the US economy looks robust. It says: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate. Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year Significantly, the Fed has also change the language in its statement. It now only expects \u201csome\u201d further interest rate rises in future. The Fed has lowered its forecast for interest rate hikes in 2019. Policymakers now only expect two rate rises next year, down from three previously. NEWSFLASH: The US Federal Reserve has voted to raise interest rates, despite pressure from Donald Trump to leave them on hold today. The FOMC has decided to hike benchmark rates to 2.25%-2.5%, as most investors expected. More to follow! With just a few minutes to go, the Dow is up 1.2% or 285 points at 23,960..... Stocks, bonds and the dollar could all be volatile today, when the Fed decision hits the wires. John Hardy of Saxo Bank says the stakes are high for chairman Powell and colleagues... White-knuckle equity market declines, a hedge fund legend and President Trump are all begging Fed chair Jay Powell to cease and desist with further rate tightening ahead of today\u2019s pivotal FOMC. Will he pause or plough ahead? We find out in just 10 minutes.... The Fed may well deliver a \u2018dovish hike\u2019 today -- raising borrowing costs, while sounding less optimistic that rates will keep rising. Fiona Cincotta of City Index explains: We are expecting a dovish hike from the Fed, with the well-used phrase \u201cgradual further hikes\u201d to be dropped from the statement. Furthermore, we expect the Fed to trim is forecast of further hikes. The Fed will have to strike a balance between addressing the current strength in the economy (GDP 3.5% yoy Q3) and taking onboard signs of a slowing global economy. Additionally, they will need to do this in such a way that it doesn\u2019t alarm financial markets. The fact that US equity indices are moving convincingly higher again today shows that the traders are expecting the Fed\u2019s message to soothe volatile markets. It\u2019s nearly time for one of the final economic events of 2018 -- the conclusions of the December meeting of the US Federal Reserve. Despite recent market turbulence, most financial experts expect the Fed to raise US interest rates today, by a quarter of one percent. That would lift the headline cost of borrowing up to 2.25%-2.5%, the highest since early 2008. It would also be the 9th interest rate increase since the Fed started normalising policy in 2016. But that\u2019s not the only thing to watch out for. The Fed will release new economic predictions, which may show less optimism about growth prospects. That will be accompanied by a new dot plot, showing where policymakers expect interest rate to be over the next couple of years. Those dots will be closely scrutinised, to see if the Fed is signalling a pause in its hiking cycle. If it doesn\u2019t, we can expect Donald Trump to be vocal in his criticism of the Fed. The president has already urged chairman Jerome Powell and colleagues not to hike, meaning the pressure is on tonight... European stock markets have closed higher tonight. The FTSE 100 gained 64 points, or almost 1%, to 6,765, recovering from its lowest close in two years on Tuesday. GlaxoSmithKline led the rally, ending the session almost 4% higher after announcing its consumer healthcare tie-up with Pfizer. Tim Gamble, Global Head of Pharma Consulting at the Economist Intelligence Unit, says: What this deal means is a concerted pivot towards innovation and decoupling of the consumer healthcare business. The hook up with 23andMe, appointment of Hal Barron to R&amp;D gives insight into the innovation strategy pursued by Chief Executive Emma Walmsey. This places greater strain on the Pharma division - but it\u2019s external regulatory constraints that may yet place the drag on Walmsey\u2019s ambitions.\u201d Italy was the stand-out performer today, gaining 1.6% after reaching a compromise with the European commission over its 2019 budget. The German DAX gained 0.4%, while France\u2019s CAC rose by 0.6%. With just over an hour to go until the US interest rate decision, stocks are up on Wall Street too. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 275 points at 23,950, a gain of 1.1%. But that could unravel if the Fed is more hawkish than expected tonight.... Back in London, cab hire company Uber has lost another legal attempt to prevent its UK drivers being classed as workers, rater than self-employed. The Court of Appeal has has upheld an earlier ruling, in 2016, that drivers were effectively employed by Uber, and thus entitled to holiday pay and the minimum wage. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says it\u2019s an important decision: \u201cNo company is above the law. Uber must play by the rules and treat its staff properly. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling should be a warning to other gig economy employers. If you play fast and loose with workers\u2019 rights, unions will expose you and hold you to account. Jonathan Chamberlain, partner at law firm Gowling WLG, says other companies should take note: Yet another court confirms that the more a brand seeks to control the activities of the people that deliver that brand\u2019s services to the public, the less likely those people are to be self-employed. The law will probably always remain uncertain in this area, despite the governments promise of reform, but the direction of travel is clear. I expect the Supreme Court to uphold this judgement but we shall see.\u201d Wall Street is open, but traders are keeping their powder dry, ahead of the US interest rate decision.... A quick recap. UK inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 20 months. Consumer prices rose by 2.3% in the year to November, thanks to cheaper petrol and clothes. Economists believe that inflation will keep slowing in 2019, helping to keep real wages in positive territory. UK house price inflation has also slowed, to its lowest level in over five years. Price in London fell by 1.7%, as Brexit anxiety weighs on demand. The Italian stock market is surging after Rome and the EU reached agreement over its budget plans for next year. Investors are nervously awaiting the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate decision, at 7pm GMT. The Fed is likely to raise borrowing costs, but could also lower its forecasts for future rate hikes. Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says the Fed could surprise the markets by holding borrowing costs -- something which president Trump has been demanding for months. A dovish hike is widely expected today and increases next year reduced to one or two, although I wonder whether they may hold off and surprise the markets. I may not agree with Trump\u2019s constant Fed bashing but he may have a point on this occasion. With the global economy facing lower growth in 2019, including the US, inflation in check and US stocks in correction territory, it may not be the best time to be raising rates. I don\u2019t think anyone would blame the Fed for taking a break this month and lining up two or three next year, depending on how the economy performs. It may even provide comfort for investors and be the catalyst for a late Santa surge, bringing the year to an end on a more positive not. Of course, this will then naturally attract criticism that the central bank is bowing to pressure from the White House but being independent doesn\u2019t always mean going against the wishes of Trump. It\u2019s official! The European Commission and Italy have reached an agreement over its 2019 budget. The peace deal avoids Rome being hauled an \u2018excessive deficit procedure\u2019 that could have led to an EU fine -- and potentially fuelled euroscepticism in Italy. AFP has more details: European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said Wednesday that the \u201cagreement is not ideal\u201d but allows the Commission to avoid legal action against Italy \u201cprovided that the measures are fully implemented.\u201d The threat of action is not rare in EU terms but it came amid growing tension between the Commission and Italy\u2019s populist government, which had vowed to resist any pressure from Brussels. Dombrovskis said \u201cthe Italian government has come a long way\u201d from the heated rhetoric of a few weeks ago. The early rally in Italian stocks is continuing -- the FTSE MIB is now up 1.8%, while the yield (or interest rate) on Italy\u2019s 10-year government debt has plunged to 2.77%, down from 2.94% yesterday. Here\u2019s our news story on the slowdown in UK house price growth, and the dip in consumer price inflation. Britain\u2019s factories have produced some Christmas cheer , reporting that orders have risen in December for the second month running. A pick-up in export demand helped to swell order books, according to the CBI. This kept its order book balance in positive territory (meaning more factories had higher orders rather than lower ones), although at +8 it was down on November\u2019s +10 However, the sector is still anxious about Brexit. CBI economist Anna Leach explains: \u201cThe UK\u2019s manufacturing sector enters the Christmas period with a small upswing, with output growth gathering further pace. The firming in exports orders is also particularly welcome. \u201cBut uncertainty over Brexit still casts a long shadow over this sector and the rest of the economy,\u201d she said. \u201cPoliticians must finally stop the endless infighting and come together to secure a workable solution, or we\u2019re in danger of edging closer to a no-deal Brexit.\u201d Here\u2019s Dan Tomlinson from Resolution Foundation on the slowdown in UK house price growth: Alastair Neame, senior economist at the CEBR thinktank, also predicts that inflation will keep falling in the months ahead, as retailers fight for business. \u201cLower inflation is another welcome sign that household finances will continue to improve over the coming months, but low confidence and consumer indebtedness look set to keeping spending in check.\u201c Today\u2019s inflation report also shows that clothing prices have fallen by 0.8% in the last year -- the only thing that has actually got cheaper since November 2017. Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity International, reckons Brexit angst is pulling inflation down, as retailers are forced to slash prices. \u201cBrexit uncertainty and flagging consumer confidence are showing up in increasingly soggy data, with inflation hitting lowered expectations this morning. Retailers are being forced into heavy discounting to persuade shoppers to open their wallets, offsetting the inflationary impact of the weaker pound. Clothing was a notable drag. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s not all bad news as last week\u2019s ONS earnings data showed that UK wage growth has risen to a healthy 3.3%. UK households are getting progressively better off. UK inflation is clearly on a \u201cdownward trend,\u201d says Mike Jakeman, senior economist at PwC. That\u2019s a boost to workers, as earnings are expected to keep rising this year (although a disorderly Brexit could change that!). Jakeman says: \u201cConsumer price inflation slowed in November, to 2.3% year on year, from 2.4% in October. This was the slowest pace of increase for 20 months and was driven by the effect of lower global oil prices, which reduced the cost of a tank of fuel for British motorists by an average of 2.6 pence a litre in the past month. But even setting the aside the effects of volatile components such as fuel, it is clear that inflation is on a downward trend. Both headline and core inflation measures have steadily slowed during 2018, as the effect of a weaker pound has diminished and economic growth has remained tepid. Good news for anyone looking to get onto the housing ladder: UK house price inflation has hit its lowest in over five years. The price of the average UK property rose by 2.7% in the year to October, down from 3% in September. Once again, London property prices dragged the national average down -- dropping by 1.7% in the last 12 months. Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent, fears that 2019 will be tough for the housing market too: Overall, prospects for the new year are not good as all the recent Brexit and general economic uncertainty are not reflected in these statistics. \u2018On the ground, December is proving to be fairly typical - generally quiet but still, thankfully, a fair number of buyers who need to move checking out what they consider are the best value options.\u2019 At 2.3%, inflation is moving close to the Bank of England\u2019s target. Jeremy Thomson-Cook of foreign exchange firm World First says: \u201cInflation is moving back towards the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2% and allowing real wages gains to extend into the end of the year. The main pressure within the CPI basket is naturally fuel given the precipitous falls we have seen in the cost of a barrel of oil but food prices have also been kept in check ahead of the Christmas period. The BoE might be relieved to see inflation dropping. On the other hand, as Geoff Tily of the TUC points out, it might fear that last summer\u2019s rate hike was a mistake: This chart confirms that cheaper fuel helped to pull UK inflation down last month. The ONS says: Petrol prices fell by 2.6 pence per litre between October and November 2018, compared with a rise of 1.8 pence per litre between October and November 2017. This was partially offset by an upward contribution from sea fares, which rose this year but fell a year ago. But what about the drop in recreation costs? According to the ONS, that\u2019s due to a drop in the price of computer games, and concert tickets (both of which can be volatile, depending on which musical stars are touring the country, and when the latest gaming blockbuster is released). The drop in inflation means UK wages are outpacing the cost of living. Average earnings are currently rising 3.3%, meaning real wages are growing by around 1%. Newsflash: Inflation in the UK has fallen to its lowest level since March 2017, giving shoppers a much-needed boost ahead of Christmas. The Consumer Prices Index dropped to 2.3% per year in November, the Office for National Statistics says, down from 2.4% in October. The ONS says that lower petrol prices pulled inflation down; games, toys and hobbies, and cultural services also had a downward impact on the cost of living., However, tobacco prices rose at a faster pace (due to higher taxes). Accommodation services and passenger sea transport all had an upward impact on inflation. More to follow.... Newsflash: Banking group Santander has been fined \u00a332.8m by the UK financial watchdog, for a frankly shocking failure to handle the accounts and investments of deceased customers properly. The Financial Conduct Authority has imposed the penalty, after concluding that Santander had often failed to do the right thing when a customer died. Failings in its probate and bereavement processes meant that Santander sometimes didn\u2019t transfer money to beneficiaries for several years. According to the FCA, there were weaknesses in Santander\u2019s systems which: reduced its ability to effectively identify all the funds it held which formed part of a deceased customer\u2019s estate; resulted in it failing to effectively follow-up on communications with deceased customer representatives which increased the likelihood of probate and bereavement cases not being closed; and led to it ineffectively monitoring open probate and bereavement cases to allow it to determine whether cases had progressed to closure. The FCA is also unhappy that Santander didn\u2019t come clean about the problems . In a stern rebuke, it says: Santander did not notify the FCA of the nature or extent of the issues it faced, including the numbers of potentially affected customers and assets, and was selective in the information it provided. Accordingly, Santander\u2019s conduct fell below the standards of openness and cooperation expected of an authorised firm. Italian bonds and stocks are rallying this morning, on relief that Rome has reached a peace deal with Brussels over its budget. Last night, the Italian Treasury announced it had reached a \u201ca technical agreement with EU officials\u201d which could avoid an \u201cexcessive deficit procedure\u201d being launched against the eurozone\u2019s third-largest member. Last week, Italy proposed cutting its planned budget deficit for 2019 to 2.04% from 2.4% of gross domestic product. That might keep it within EU rules -- and compares favourably with France\u2019s aims... Any deal still needs the approval of European commissioners, who meet later today. Plus, any budget changes would need to be passed by the Italian Senate. But the markets are already excited, sending the Italian FTSE MIB up 1.5% this morning. World stock markets have a decidedly edgy feel this morning, as investors wait for the Fed\u2019s rate decision. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite index has fallen by 1%, amid ongoing anxiety about trade relations with the US. Japan\u2019s Nikkei has dipped by 0.6%. European shares are more positive; with the Stoxx 600 up around 0.2%. The FTSE 100 is bouncing back from yesterday\u2019s selloff, up around 0.35%. GSK are leading the way, as investors hail its break-up plan. Boom! Shares in pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline have soared by 5% at the start of trading, after it surprised the City with a break-up plan. GSK has agreed to spin off its consumer healthcare business in a \u00a310bn joint venture with rival Pfizer. GSK, whose consumer brands include Sensodyne and Panadol, will have a controlling stake in the partnership of 68% and Pfizer will own 32%. The FTSE 100 drug maker said that within three years of closing the deal, it will demerge and float the consumer health business, splitting GSK into two distinct businesses \u2013 one focused on consumer and the other on pharmaceuticals and vaccines. Investors around the globe will be watching Fed chair Jerome Powell tonight, when he explains tonight\u2019s interest rate decision. Shares could soar, or slide, depending on the guidance that Powell gives for future rate hikes in 2019. Ditto the dollar. Naeem Islam of Think Markets explains: Market participants widely expect the statement to be somewhat dovish and the markets believe that going into 2019, the Fed isn\u2019t going to be this aggressive because of the tighter financial conditions. Mr Powell is likely to indicate two or maximum three rates hikes in 2019. For investors, one to two rate hikes would be considered more dovish to neutral but two to three rate hikes would be aggressive because the economic indicators have started to flash warning light with respect to any aggressive monetary policy. In terms of trading the event, aggressive tone by the Fed would be negative for the equity market and the sell-off may become intense. The Dow Jones may take a nose dive and the move could in the range of 300-500 points. However, a dovish statement could support the equity markets and it would restore some confidence so investors expect about 150-250 points move for the Dow on the back of this. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. To hike or not to hike, that is the question facing America\u2019s central bankers today. The Federal Reserve had been certain to raise interest rates at its final meeting of 2018 today, in line with its policy of normalising monetary policy and tackling inflation. But Donald Trump has thrown clouds of uncertainty over the Fed, by repeatedly urging the Fed to leave interest rates alone. After several stinging tweets, the markets now reckon there\u2019s a 25% chance that the Fed won\u2019t hike at tonight\u2019s monetary policy meeting: But central bank independence is important. So despite Trump\u2019s best efforts, the Fed will probably push US borrowing costs up again tonight (while bracing for another Twitter blast), to 2.5%. But the Fed will also update the markets on its plans for 2019, and many investors predict it will slash its forecasts for future rate hikes. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group explains: The market is pricing in a 72.3% probability of the Fed hiking today. This would be the fourth-rate hike for 2018. However, the real concern for the market is what comes next. With growing fears over the health of the global economy, the markets simply don\u2019t think the US economy can handle higher rates. Traders will be watching for dovish signs, such as the dropping of the phrase \u201cfurther gradual rate rises\u201d from the statement and a softening of the dot plot from three hikes to at most two. In short, if the Fed must hike today, and they will struggle to justify not hiking on current US economic strength; then it will need to be a dovish hike to prevent the US equity markets dumping once more. The dollar has traded lower across the week in anticipation of a dovish hike. Such a dovish hike might calm market nerves, after a turbulent few months. Earlier this week the US stock market fell to a 14-month low, while Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 closed at a two-year low last night. Also coming up.... New UK inflation figures will also show how the cost of living changed last month in Britain. Economists predict that consumer prices rose by 2.3% last year, down from 2.4% in October. It could confirm that retailers have been slashing prices in recent months, in an attempt to persuade shoppers to part with some cash.
