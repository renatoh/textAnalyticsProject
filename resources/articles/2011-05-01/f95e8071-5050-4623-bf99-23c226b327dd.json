According to the Premier League a \"significant majority\" of clubs voted in May 2009 to adopt the rule, which obliges clubs to fill a third of their senior squad with homegrown players and encourages the use of under-21s. It came into force last summer, and near the end of its first full season our figures show that appearances by English players who qualify as under-21 rose by over a fifth \u2013 21% \u2013 compared with last season. While the number of young Englishmen who have appeared for top-flight clubs is only marginally higher than in 2009-10, rising to 57 from 55, they have been used far more frequently \u2013 last year they made a combined total of 483 appearances while this season they have played 584 times. Among the successes are Jack Wilshere, who has played for Arsenal in 34 league games and broken into the England side, and Andy Carroll, who had played 19 times for Newcastle and made his England debut before he joined Liverpool for \u00a335m in January. The figures were welcomed by Ged Roddy, the Premier League's director of youth. \"Premier League clubs are working extremely hard to bring young players through their academies and into first-team squads,\" he said. \"The clubs unanimously backed the homegrown player and squad rules and, recognising that there is still more progress that can be made in this area, are working with us on proposals that will further enhance the way we develop more and better young players.\" It appears that the rule is achieving the aims set out by the Premier League's chief executive, Richard Scudamore, when it was introduced. \"We think it will give clubs an extra incentive to invest in youth,\" he said. \"We think that one of the benefits will be that it will help the England team.\" But the picture is not all rosy for Fabio Capello, with the Premier League continuing to employ more foreign players than any of its major rivals. Some 58.4% of clubs' squads are ineligible for the national team, compared with 46.4% in Italy, 45.7% in Germany, 37.9% in Spain, 29.5% in France and a European average of 33.6%. The rule forced top-flight clubs to name a 25-man senior squad, of which eight places were reserved for players who, irrespective of nationality, had spent their formative years in England or Wales. In addition clubs could field as many young players as they liked, defined by Uefa as being not yet 21 at the start of the year in which the season begins. The rule has not been adopted with universal enthusiasm: neither Manchester City nor Wolverhampton Wanderers have fielded a qualifying under-21 English player in the league this season. Blackpool (Mark Halstead), Bolton (Daniel Sturridge), Manchester United (Chris Smalling) and West Bromwich Albion (James Hurst) have picked only one each. The young player with the most first-team appearances this season is Sunderland's 20-year-old midfielder Jordan Henderson, who has started 36 of his club's 37 league games. Sunderland have also used more unregistered youngsters than any other side \u2013 eight \u2013 and have given debuts to four under-21s. Other teams who have frequently called on young domestic talent include Aston Villa, West Ham and Liverpool, for whom John Flanagan, Martin Kelly and Jonjo Shelvey have become important members of the first-team squad, having made only one Premier League appearance between them last season. Liverpool's 17-year-old left-back Jack Robinson is once again the youngest player to have played in a top-flight game, retaining the record he set when coming on as an 88th\u2011minute substitute in the final game of last season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
