They are on a conveyor belt of A-grade DNA and they have just had a good two hours of prep from the world's best hair and make-up artists. Of course they look gorgeous. Encounter them before the army of stylists have started work, however, and you can begrudge them all you like: they look equally good before a blow-drier has come anywhere near them. But what really inspires jealousy is their skin. Forget bogstandard complexion categories such as \"normal\", \"dry\" or \"oily\". Supermodel skin is characterised by a poreless radiance that is accented only by ridiculously thick (but apparently mascara-less) eyelashes and seemingly natural petal-pink lips and cheeks. But surely it takes a little something to look that good. But what exactly? The definitive \"no make-up make-up\" product list is the holy grail of grooming; could it be found with a rummage through the depths of some models' handbags? Hearing it from the thoroughbreds' mouths is not easy - \"I don't really wear make-up\" is always the first line of defence from the cornered model, reluctant to admit that she doesn't roll out of bed looking like a Calvin Klein ad. Perhaps in the interests of scoring a cosmetics contract, however, some will admit to a few concessions to the au naturelle rule. From shoots and shows models acquire first-hand knowledge of what sets apart the best products, and the trick of how to use them to their fullest effect. The first claim is that tinted lip balm is indispensable. \"Lipstick gives too much colour and gloss looks too obvious,\" says Elize Crombez. \"A reddish lip balm like the one by Nuxe gives just a bit of colour as it conditions.\" While most models cited the almost imperceptibly translucent shades of MAC's tinted lip conditioner in Petting Pink or Kiehl's tinted lip balm, Karen Elson did pick up a Paris Hilton-esque lip gloss backstage at Chanel, claiming \"almost complete obsession\" with its pink opalescent shade. (But bear in mind that this ability to make even the most marshmallowy lacquer look low-key is somewhat unique.) If you're not about to go out and stockpile these particular lip balms, at least ditch those high-lacquer lippies. By adding copious amounts of lip balm to a berry shade of lipstick you can achieve the sheer look. Mascara is also deemed mandatory, supplemented at night with some very Kate Moss black kohl pencil - by Lanc\u00f4me or MAC - smudged around the lower lashes. While Jacquetta Wheeler falls in the camp that favours Stephane Marais' comb mascara, \"because it's really precise yet natural - make-up artists always use it on shoots\", YSL false lashes and Maybelline's great lash mascaras also give the right mix of definition without being clumpy. But if you want a model's skin, you need to do more than simply follow Erin O'Connor's advice to drink three litres of water a day. Naomi Campbell apart - she has \"been wearing Bobbi Brown's foundation shades 6 and 7 for years\" because \"she created them for me\" - most models tend to be foundation-phobes. As fans of skincare from Dr Hauschka or La Roche-Posay (the French pharmacy brand beloved of make-up artists), most models forgo base in favour of blending strategic amounts of Touche Eclat or Cl\u00e9 de Peau concealer into Dr Hauschka's quince day cream or La Roche-Posay's Hydranorme, sometimes with a little of the latest skin-luminescing fluids added to the mix. While fair-faced Liberty Ross likes Shu Uemura's base control in pearl and the golden Karolina Kurkova raves about By Terry's colour skin enhancer in apricot, after witnessing the soft-focusing effect of MAC's HyperReal foundation on her skin for the Alexander McQueen show this season, Julia Stegner begged a bottle from make-up artist Peter Phillips. So there you have it. If you pick the best products - a bit of well-placed base, a slick of mascara and a smudge of berry-hued lip balm - that really is all it takes to look \"born with it, only better\". Now, if only Carmen Kass would just confess to using something other than \"water, maybe, like, some airline soap\" on her face, then we'd be able definitively to state that, yes, even for alpha females, it does take a little something to look that good."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
