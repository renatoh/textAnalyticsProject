The laws were drawn up before same-sex marriages were recognised. The vote by the Queensland parliament on Wednesday to amend the state\u2019s Births, Deaths and Marriages Act recognised the existing marriages of people who undertake gender reassignment. They can now apply to have their birth certificates amended without having to get divorced. \u201cThis is not a cost or a consequence any law of this state should impose on members of our community,\u201d said the state\u2019s attorney-general, Yvette D\u2019Ath. \u201cIt has been unjust and unfair and I\u2019m proud to say this distressing choice will no longer be a requirement in Queensland. \u201cI hope delivering this reform will go some way to helping the transgender community to live their lives openly and without judgment.\u201d The changes were supported by the Liberal National party opposition, the Greens and the independent Sandy Bolton. One Nation and Katter\u2019s Australia party MPs voted against them. The KAP state leader, Rob Katter, told the ABC said the party was philosophically opposed to the federal law changes and the Queensland bill. \u201cIt\u2019s a consistent ideological position we have,\u201d Katter said. \u201cThis is a continued attack on traditional values and we want to represent the traditional views.\u201d The Palaszczuk government has steadily reviewed a number of laws, some remaining from Queensland\u2019s conservative past, on human rights grounds. It has expunged historical convictions for homosexual people, removing the \u201cgay panic\u201d defence in assault and murder cases, changed the age of consent and removed barriers to same-sex adoption. The government is now reviewing abortion laws, which in some parts date back to 1899. It is expected the state will begin a euthanasia debate after abortion laws are passed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
