The Liverpool captain was forced off after a second-half collision with Yves Bissouma and underwent a scan on his return to Merseyside to determine whether he sustained ligament damage. Henderson is expected to receive the results on Friday but there are concerns at Liverpool that the influential midfielder faces a prolonged spell on the sidelines that could include the beginning of the Premier League champions\u2019 title defence. Klopp expressed fears over Henderson\u2019s injury after the 3-1 victory, saying: \u201cI know it will not be nothing.\u201d The 30-year-old, who flew back with the team from Brighton, would be a severe loss to the Liverpool manager. He would also miss England\u2019s Nations League matches against Iceland and Denmark on 5 and 8 September respectively should the club\u2019s concerns be realised. Henderson is due to lift the Premier League trophy at Anfield on 22 July after Liverpool\u2019s final home game of the season against Chelsea. Meanwhile, Liverpool and Fulham are set to go to a tribunal to decide a compensation fee for Harvey Elliott with the clubs poles apart in their valuation of the 17-year-old forward. Elliott moved to Liverpool from Craven Cottage on academy terms last summer and has been part of Klopp\u2019s first-team squad for most of the season. His progress was rewarded this week with a first professional contract. Fulham are believed to have been offered \u00a3750,000 for the highly rated teenager, whom they value at closer to \u00a37m. Unless there is a breakthrough in negotiations a decision will have to be taken by a tribunal, with the fee decided by the Professional Football Compensation Committee. Elliott has made eight appearances for Liverpool\u2019s first team and Klopp recently cited the player\u2019s development as a reason why the Premier League champions may not be busy in the transfer market."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
