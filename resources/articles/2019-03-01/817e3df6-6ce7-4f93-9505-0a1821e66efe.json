Having taken over a year on Friday, Giggs\u2019s 10th match in charge ended as a fourth victory to go with five defeats and a draw. Before Sunday\u2019s opening Euro 2020 qualifier against Slovakia the manager protected all his A-listers. This meant no Bale, Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen, Ben Davies or first-choice goalkeeper, Wayne Hennessey. Giggs pointed to Bale\u2019s full part in Real Madrid\u2019s win over Celta Vigo last Saturday. \u201cIt was a first 90 minutes in three months,\u201d he said. \u201cHe took part in a little bit of training yesterday, trained this morning really well but it was too much of a risk for him.\u201d There was a chance for fringe players to push a claim with Newcastle\u2019s Paul Dummett the only regular Premier League performer \u2013 the Leicester goalkeeper Danny Ward a reserve, along with Liverpool\u2019s Woodburn. Dennis Lawrence\u2019s Trinidad &amp; Tobago had lost their previous two games and in Sheldon Bateau of Norway\u2019s Sarpsborg had a solitary Europe-based player. Lawrence, a former Wrexham player of five years, watched as Wales started brightly. Woodburn, the striker in Giggs\u2019s 4-2-3-1, slipped a ball into Ryan Hedges and his dink was reached by Tyler Roberts though the Trinidad goalkeeper, Marvin Phillip, was not troubled. The visitors operated a 4-4-1-1 and the captain, Khaleem Hyland, offered a first threat, taking aim from distance at Ward\u2019s goal. Then came a burst of quality as the Trinidad No 9, Will Plaza, found Hyland and he recycled the ball to Nathan Lewis at speed; Wales were grateful nothing came of it. So, too, were the visitors when George Thomas sprayed wide as the interval neared. Just before the whistle Woodburn suffered a painful challenge from Kevan George but was able to resume. For the second half Giggs brought off Ward for Adam Davies, the Barnsley keeper making his international debut. Lawrence\u2019s switch was to replace Plaza with Cordell Cato of Oklahoma City. Giggs named Ashley Williams as captain despite the on-loan Everton centre-back\u2019s struggle to play regularly for Stoke and the manager will not have been happy to see him cede the ball carelessly. When Woodburn slipped in Thomas the No 11\u2019s fierce shot warmed Phillip\u2019s fingers \u2013 and the support \u2013 as he saved to his right. Suddenly the game flared: Levi Garcia rounded Davies at the other end and found Aubrey David and his effort was cleared off the Wales line by Gunter. From here Giggs\u2019s men pressed and finally got the breakthrough, Woodburn\u2019s chest home coming from a Vaulks\u2019s ball to the back post. His goal gave Wales the perfect boost before the serious stuff, Sunday\u2019s start to their qualification campaign for the European Championship. \u201cI\u2019m gutted for the boys,\u201d Lawrence said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
