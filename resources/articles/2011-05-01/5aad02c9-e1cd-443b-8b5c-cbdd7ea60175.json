We must understand how people who can barely remember the Troubles come to be caught up in continuing violence; many are restricted to the part of a community (both sides) which sees how some \"people\" have done well out of the Troubles, and many young people in these areas have had no meaningful connection to the \"other\" community, given the deep segregation. The role of integrated education in overcoming divisions and putting a line under the past has long been neglected and needs to become a major priority for all in Northern Ireland.
