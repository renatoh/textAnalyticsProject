Tomorrow's London Marathon promises to be the usual confusing mash-up of elite athletics and a particularly raucous and eccentric village f\u00eate. Leading the pack will be a select clique of really fast skinny people in small shorts who are actually having a race; behind them a mass of slower skinny people with chunky digital watches and Egham Harriers singlets who are not really having a race but carry a certain air of gravity as they lope past the bus shelters of Bermondsey. And at the rear: the gurning rabble in their tutus and gorilla masks. These people are definitely not having a race, more a very public workplace eccentric support day, a carnival of zaniness that collapses around the six-mile mark in a farrago of tears, vomit and sweat-soaked Bob The Builder all-in-ones. But still we love the marathon. Tomorrow morning London will once again be packing them in six-deep. It's enough to make you wonder how things might have turned out if the marathon had got its heavily blistered foot in the door a little earlier. What if, at the vital moment, history had favoured the marathon? In short, what if we lived in a world where the marathon was king? Not that things look very different at first. It is Friday morning. You are up and out of your Paul Tergat-branded pillow and duvet set by 7.30am. Slipping on a chalk-stripe lycra all-in-one body-stocking, you head downstairs for breakfast: eight skinless chicken breasts and a tureen of brown rice. You are in a bit of a hurry, so you put the whole lot in a plastic cup and throw it over your head on the way to the front door. Taking your 19th-century deep-sea diving suit from the hat stand, you head off to work. The pantomime horse might have been quicker but the six-hour trudge leaves plenty of time to glance at the morning paper. There is more gloom over soaring global nipple lubricant prices, as Vaseline hits the $100-a-barrel mark. On the back pages it is all about the Premier Marathon League's Grand Slam Marathon Weekend. And on the fashion pages are yet more edgy pictures of post-modern style icons, the Ethiopian Olympic marathon squad drenched in ketchup and performing an aerobic workout in a moodily lit East London loft. In the street some kids are having a scratch marathon with jumpers for crowd control barriers. You cannot resist joining in for a quick breakaway kick with the leading group near the 20-mile mark. Eventually you make it to your desk at the international marathon sponsorship brokers, where you are head of guilt-inducing late collections. There are still those who lament the late 20th-century shift away from traditional industry towards a marathon sponsorship-based economy. There has even been talk recently of a global sponsorship crunch. You ponder this as you pop outside to squat down and urinate in the gutter after lunch. Otherwise it is a typical Friday and by mid-afternoon most of your colleagues are walking on their hands, hyperventilating and generally winding down for the weekend. There is talk of a few sharpeners in the Nerurkar &amp; Spedding - you leave early but a pack of elite Kenyans has got there already (as usual), so you are forced to stand near the door hurling pints of lager over your heads. After which it is back home and into the shiny silver cape for a long night in the oxygen tent. Your race is run for another day - at least until the next one in six months' time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
