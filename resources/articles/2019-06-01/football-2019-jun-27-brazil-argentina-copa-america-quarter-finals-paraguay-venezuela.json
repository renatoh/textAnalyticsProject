For Brazil and Argentina, the Copa Am\u00e9rica quarter-finals feel as if they are playing out of a series of psychodramas in which they must face both an old enemy and their own greatest neuroses and failings. Paraguay and Venezuela may have nothing like their long-term history of success, but they do have recent history of causing the giants problems. For the third regular Copa Am\u00e9rica in a row, Brazil will meet Paraguay in the quarter-final (at the bonus Centenario edition in 2016, neither side made it out of the group.) One is the most successful nation in World Cup history, the other has never got beyond the last eight; one has won five Copas Am\u00e9rica in the past 30 years, the other has not won it in 40; one boasts as its most-capped player the three-times World Cup champion and Champions League winner Cafu, the other the former Sunderland centre-back Paulo da Silva. And yet Paraguay eliminated Brazil in both 2011 and 2015. Eight years ago Neymar arrived at the Copa Am\u00e9rica having just helped Santos to the Copa Libertadores. He was 19 but already being hailed as the brightest emerging talent from Brazil in four decades, the new Pel\u00e9 waiting to be crowned. But everybody has a gilded future until they get kicked in the air by a Paraguayan. Deployed at right-back as a special welcome in the group stage was Dar\u00edo Ver\u00f3n, a gnarled 30-something centre-back in the great Paraguayan tradition. The look of shock on Neymar\u2019s face when Ver\u00f3n first clattered him still resonates, the horror of a player cosseted at home suddenly discovering that the rest of the world had no interest in easing his passage to the pantheon. A last-minute equaliser meant Brazil got away with a 2-2 draw but they then faced Paraguay again in the quarter-final. It was a similar story, only this time it finished 0-0. An ineffective Neymar was withdrawn in the second half for Fred who, as his side disintegrated, ended up being the fourth Brazilian out of four to miss from the spot as they lost the shootout. Four years later, everybody had worked out Brazil could be rattled if you kicked them (or, more accurately by then, if you kicked them back.) By the time they faced Paraguay in the last eight in Concepci\u00f3n, they had already lost Neymar for the tournament after he abused a referee following a petulant red card in a ferocious group game against Colombia. Brazil took the lead but were rattled by Paraguay\u2019s physicality and again ended up losing on penalties, their soft centre exposed. This is not the same Paraguay. Eduardo Berizzo has been appointed to try to modernise their football in the same way he, as an assistant, helped his great mentor Marcelo Bielsa reinvent Chile a decade ago. The prospect of a high-tempo, high-pressing game married to Paraguay\u2019s habitual tenacity is appealing but the evidence of the group stage is that they remain a work in progress. They pose more of an attacking threat than in the past but with enhanced creativity has come greater vulnerability. Whether this is the same Brazil is debatable. Tite is an admirably calm manager but public opinion has started to wonder whether he may be a little cautious. The 5-0 win over Peru in the final group game was perhaps not as emphatic as the scoreline suggests: although Gabriel Jesus revelled in his right-sided role and Brazil played extremely well in the second half, their fluency came only after being presented with two early goals. Paraguay will not be so generous and if there is any hint of self-indulgence about Brazil, Paraguay, even in this evolving form, are the ideal side to expose it. How Argentina would love their biggest problem to be wondering whether a 5-0 victory was really as convincing as it appeared. Under Lionel Scaloni, who has used 40 different players during his 12 games as a caretaker, they are a blind man in the fog blundering about with only the vaguest sense of which direction they may be heading. Venezuela have beaten them only twice in 25 previous meetings and yet so bad have things become that La Naci\u00f3n this week ran a piece under the headline \u201cArgentina has much to learn from the Venezuelan revolution\u201d (it was referring, it should be made clear, to football, a beacon of consistency amid the political chaos.) Rafael Dudamel was named Venezuela coach in 2016 while continuing to serve as the under-20 manager, a position he had taken the previous year. In that time, Argentina have been through seven under-20 coaches and four senior national coaches, with little of any sense of collaboration between the roles. This will be Dudamel\u2019s fifth game against Argentina and the first time he has met a coach for the second time. His previous game against Scaloni\u2019s Argentina came in a friendly in Madrid in March and was won 3-1. Just as Paraguay\u2019s qualities highlight Brazil\u2019s greatest weakness, so Venezuela\u2019s consistency and coherence \u2013 Venezuela\u2019s! \u2013 exposes the shambles of the Argentinian game. The grandees should be feeling very nervous."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
