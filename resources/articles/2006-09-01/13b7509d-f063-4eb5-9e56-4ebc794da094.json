The deal had been announced by Charlton around 10.30pm on deadline day but, after a disagreement over a recall clause, Leeds pulled out and instead extended the loan of Tony Warner from Fulham. Charlton's general manager Andrew Mills said yesterday: \"It looked as though the deal was done but Leeds were uncomfortable with the recall clause we were keen to implement, so. . . it did not happen.\" Andersen, a Denmark international who cost Charlton \u00a3721,000 from AB Copenhagen in 2004, thus finds himself still at The Valley and fighting to be merely second choice in Iain Dowie's plans. After injury to Dean Kiely, and then the departure of the long-time Charlton No1 goalkeeper in January, Andersen hoped to fill his place, only for the Norwegian veteran Thomas Myhre to be preferred towards the end of the season. Despite Dowie replacing Alan Curbishley in the summer, the new manager felt the need to bring in England's Under-21 goalkeeper Scott Carson, who has started all Charlton's three games this season. Mills added: \"We felt we needed to mirror the Carson situation. Iain could not afford to loan out Stephan and not have the option to recall him in the event of anything happening with Scott.\" Uefa has ordered a disciplinary crackdown on the eve of the main opening European Championship qualifying programme. Any player waving an imaginary card in an attempt to get an opponent booked will be cautioned themselves, Uefa ruled after a rash of such actions in the summer's World Cup finals. Referees have also been ordered to caution at least one player, not just the initiator, if surrounded by a group. Dissent by gesture, too, must be punished with a yellow card."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
