Now the band's most visible member, Cheryl Cole, an act-manufacturer herself on The X Factor, has begun stepping out with other songwriters. Care and craftsmanship, as well as money, have clearly been pumped into Cole's solo debut, but the old spark is missing. Even the presence of hit-making Midas Will.I.Am, fails to bring 3 Words alive. The exception is his title track, a slick, sophisticated love song that hints at what this album could have been."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
