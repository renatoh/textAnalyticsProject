Truly. I remember, as a child, you could win a whole summer of ice-cream and I saved and I bought several tickets. I did not win and the little girl who won only had one ticket. How about that? I\u2019ve been holding that grudge for 40 years.\u201d An American Marriage, the story of a black man falsely imprisoned for a violent assault on a woman he glancingly meets in an Atlanta motel, has certainly transformed Jones\u2019s literary fortunes. Crucially, it caught the eye of Oprah Winfrey, who last year selected it for her Book Club \u2013 a guarantee of enormously enhanced sales and profile. Then came the moment when the former US president Barack Obama included it on his increasingly celebrated list of summer reading, praising its \u201cmoving portrayal of the effects of a wrongful conviction on a young African-American couple\u201d. It\u2019s easy to see what attracted Winfrey and Obama: the novel turns outwards to address the immense and seemingly intractable issues around the incarceration of black men, and at the same time never loses sight of the traumatic effects of injustice on its victims\u2019 most intimate relationships. As its title suggests, it\u2019s concerned not only with Roy, the young man from a working-class Atlanta family keen to grab all the opportunities life offers him, but with his wife, Celestial, an artist from a far more moneyed and socially elevated background. When I remark that two of the writers shortlisted for the Women\u2019s prize, Pat Barker and Madeline Miller, set their stories in ancient Greece, Jones points out that An American Marriage is itself in conversation with The Odyssey, the story of a man trying simply to get home to his wife; and of a wife who, left alone to hold the fort, is faced with the dilemma of how far to proceed with her own life. When people question Jones about the minutiae of the crime at the book\u2019s heart, she counters strongly: \u201cI don\u2019t want this to be a story about the police. I don\u2019t want this to be a story about law enforcement. This is not a procedural. This is the story about a family affected by wrongful conviction, about what they owe each other and the ways that they will move forward. I think that when we forget that part of stories, we are actually dismantling community.\u201d Which is not to say that Jones, 48, turns away from the stark political realities the novel is built on; she spent a year at Harvard doing research for the book and, even on this short trip to Britain, has found time to visit Brixton prison in south London, home to the inmate-run restaurant The Clink. The decision to write about imprisonment, she says, \u201cwasn\u2019t any big lightning bolt. I feel that the idea of incarceration has always been, in many ways, the boogie man under the bed for black America. There\u2019s a fear, particularly among the middle class, that you\u2019ll do everything right \u2013 you\u2019ll go to school, you\u2019ll do this, you\u2019ll do that \u2013 and then the system will just come and abduct you. That is the monster under the bed, and I wanted to look under the bed and face it head on.\u201d She says her concern spreads beyond clear miscarriages of justice to encompass the vast numbers of those in jail for non-violent drug offences, or who are mentally ill. \u201cI\u2019m not only interested in the \u2018innocent people\u2019; when we make that distinction between innocent and not innocent, we miss the major issues about prison reform.\u201d But while the horror thrown up by her research was stopping her from sleeping, it was not, she tells me, \u201cmoving my pen \u2026 I felt like I was trying to animate statistics\u201d. (She also recalls being advised to put more overt political content in the novel, \u201cas if I had some Black Lives Matter in my handbag\u201d.) Conscious of the advice that you should write fiction about people and their problems, not problems and their people, she one day found herself in a mall, tuning into a couple\u2019s argument. \u201cI heard the woman say: \u2018Roy, you know you wouldn\u2019t have waited on me for seven years.\u2019 And he said: \u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. This wouldn\u2019t have happened to you in the first place.\u2019\u201d Jones grew up in Atlanta, the child of professors \u2013 her father is a political scientist and her mother an economist; Jones remembers a childhood spent not eating grapes, in support of farm workers in California, and boycotting the products of apartheid South Africa. I ask how close the mall conversation felt to a reality she could recognise. In answer, she recalls an incident from her childhood, at a time when a serial killer was murdering young black boys, crimes that she used as the basis for her first novel, Leaving Atlanta. Two of the 28 murder victims went to her school. One night, her father was driving a family friend home and got lost. When he got back, he was shaken. \u201cHe said: \u2018I was just driving around those dark streets, I didn\u2019t know where I was going and I didn\u2019t have anyone to vouch for where I had been, and I was so afraid I would be pulled over.\u2019 It was the first time in my life I had seen my father afraid \u2026 and I now understand, he was just afraid that being a black man in the wrong place at the wrong time could have ruined his life.\u201d Jones\u2019s UK visit has, of course, coincided with that of another American, Donald Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s following me,\u201d she sighs. I ask whether she feels that the great regression sweeping her country \u2013 the rise of the far right, the rolling back of the rights of women and of minorities \u2013 feels like a threat to the fragile gains of civil rights activists. She points to what feels like an epidemic of the police being summoned to \u201cblack people doing ordinary things in ordinary places\u201d; she makes sure that when she arrives at a cafe, she orders coffee immediately, to signal that she is a patron rather than a trouble-maker or a vagrant. She has stopped looking at her neighbourhood website to which people upload their video doorbell footage because of the occasions on which neighbours would mark as suspicious the perfectly legitimate comings and goings of black people (including, she tells me, those canvassing for the Democrat politician Stacey Abrams). \u201cI am sometimes appalled,\u201d she says, \u201cat what my neighbours find to be suspicious.\u201d She is preoccupied now with what happens in a post-Trump world. \u201cLet\u2019s say Trump is not re-elected. Let\u2019s say all over the world, these far-right regimes are put down. How will we live with our neighbours, knowing what we now know of them?\u201d Jones now has a platform, but even a few years ago it was looking decidedly precarious. She couldn\u2019t find a publisher for her third novel, and her first two, well-received critically but not huge sellers, had fallen out of print. That third novel, Silver Sparrow, was firmly relegated to a drawer. Invited to a book festival, she went out of obligation, but was feeling embarrassed \u2013 as though her lack of success disqualified her from being there. But while she was there, a woman said: \u201cI can help you.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t take it very seriously because you meet a lot of unusual people on the road with unusual ideas. But she literally put my hand in the hand of a publisher.\u201d They chatted, and before they said goodbye, the publisher asked her how she knew Judy. Oh, replied Jones, I don\u2019t know anyone called Judy. \u201c\u2018No,\u2019 she says, \u2018I mean Judy Blume, who just introduced us.\u2019 It was like my childhood had rescued me in my hour of need. I turned to thank her, and she had vanished.\u201d At this moment, we turn to order some coffee. On the table is a bouquet given to her at the awards ceremony, which she wants to bring to her publishers\u2019 office so that they can enjoy it too. She is wreathed in smiles. I explain to the waiter that she has just won a prize. Suddenly, two glasses of champagne arrive. It is 11.30 in the morning, but it\u2019s not every day that you pick up a major literary award. \u201cI will if you will,\u201d says Jones.
