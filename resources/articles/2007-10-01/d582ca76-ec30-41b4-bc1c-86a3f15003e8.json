Brussels was announcing a survey showing that \"undeclared work\" accounts for 35% of the Bulgarian economy, and more than 20% of Greece's. The UK is one of the least-affected countries, with only 2% of national wealth generated by untaxed earnings. Officials warned that, by its nature, the scale of the \"hidden economy\" was hard to pin down. But employment commissioner Vladimir Spidla said there was no doubt the problem undermined efforts to boost jobs and growth. Press Association Reckitt refreshes targets thanks to Air Wick Reckitt Benckiser saw third quarter profits rise 14% and raised its targets for the year, but operating margins remained flat, sending shares down 140p, or 4.9%, to \u00a327.28. It said it had increased its full year target for net revenue and net profit growth. Bart Becht, chief executive, said growth was driven in part by new products such as Air Wick Freshmatic and Vanish Crystal White. Operating margins remained the same at 21.8%. Analysts at Evolution Securities said: \"It appears to be a result of seeding the market with air care gadgets which will result in subsequent sales of refills.\" Marianne Barriaux"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
