Under the plans, ministers would also expect the watchdog to publish an annual scorecard on company performances. The latest plans to shake up the market were released alongside figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act which apparently show that the current regulator, Ofgem, has levied 30 fines totalling more than \u00a387m on power companies since 2001 and has a further 16 probes into potential bad practice still under way. Flint, who has already promised to bring in a new watchdog and impose an energy price freeze until 2017 if Labour wins power next spring, will use a visit to the key seats of Reading East and Reading West to highlight new measures to halt industry abuses which she claims have proliferated under the coalition government. \"The public have a right to be treated fairly by energy companies. Where firms fail to meet these standards there must be tough and decisive action. Too often energy companies seem to view the regulator's fines as a cost of doing business \u2013 not as a warning to get their act together,\" she will say. \"Of course consumers must be compensated \u2013 but if energy companies persist in mistreating their customers they must know their licence could be on the line.\" Ofgem has the power to revoke licences in certain circumstances including where companies have failed to comply with enforcement orders, but the slate is wiped clean as long as fines are paid. Under Labour's proposal, which the party hopes will send a clear message to the industry, the regulator would be beefed up and repeat offenders would be threatened with losing their licences. Action by Labour against soaring energy bills is part of a wider strategy to highlight what it claims is a cost-of-living crisis that undermines Conservative boasts to have mended the economy. Flint expects to ratchet up the pressure on ministers by releasing figures which Labour says show household energy bills have risen twice as fast as inflation and four times as fast as wages since 2010. The analysis, based on numbers obtained from the Department of Energy and Climate Change, is said to show that domestic electricity prices \u2013 including taxes \u2013 rose faster than in any other EU country apart from Ireland. Flint said: \"At the next election there will be a real choice between another five years of rocketing energy bills, rip-off tactics and poor customer service under the Tories \u2013 or Labour's plans to freeze energy bills until 2017, saving the average household \u00a3120, and reform the energy market for the future.\" The Tories said the government had been working hard for consumers by rolling back green levies, forcing companies to simplify bills and overseeing a Competition and Markets Authority investigation into the \"broken market\" inherited from Labour. The party also insisted that average combined energy bills went up by 80% to \u00a3503 under the last Labour government while the number of suppliers operating in the market fell from 15 in 2000 to six when it left office. \"We'll take no lectures from the party that brought Britain's economy to its knees. Labour left our country with a broken energy market and huge taxes on bills \u2013 meaning the number of people in fuel poverty nearly doubled in Labour's last five years,\" said a Tory spokesman. The Institute of Directors business group claimed that \"aggressive\" attacks on the energy companies risked chasing away much-needed investment in Britain's energy sector. \"There is a real danger that the money needed to renew our generating capacity will dry up, shortages will appear, prices will rise much higher, and ultimately it will be the customers who suffer,\" said Dan Lewis, a senior energy policy adviser at the institute. Ofgem disputed the figures, saying it had handed out \u00a360.7m in fines since 2001 and imposed \u00a358.5m in customer redress payments. A spokesperson said Ofgem has \"powers to revoke licences in certain specific circumstances including where companies have failed to comply with particular enforcement orders we have set requiring them to change or stop behaviours.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
