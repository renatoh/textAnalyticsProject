David Redvers, who manages the racing interests of Sheikh Fahad and was named bloodstock agent of the year in November, made the incendiary claim in a blog on the website of his Tweenhills Stud, comparing the situation in Britain very unfavourably with the way the sport works in Australia and Japan. \u201cI keep asking myself how did we get it so wrong?\u201d Redvers wrote. \u201cHow can a country like Australia, with 40% of our population, be running away with the prize while we have a \u00a317m deficit in our funding and our industry relies almost entirely on the patronage of rich foreigners?\u201d While acknowledging that racing in those countries benefits from a stronger funding model than Britain\u2019s, Redvers pointed also to their \u201chigh level of participation through shared ownership and syndicates\u201d. He warned that British racing was taking for granted the investment it receives from a handful of the mega-wealthy, which also makes it an unattractive candidate for government support. \u201cAt any moment our industry could be put in catastrophic peril through the loss of just one of these major players. Falling prize money, ill health or simply a change of heart could precipitate this at any time.\u201d Redvers described as \u201cpitiful\u201d the efforts made here to attract the kind of partnerships and syndicates which give ownership in Australia and Japan a much broader base. Indeed British officials \u201con occasions appear to go out of their way to make things difficult\u201d, he said. Approached by the Guardian, Redvers added that the reason Sheikh Fahad and his family run their horses under the \u2018Qatar Racing\u2019 banner is that, when the Sheikh asked for his name and those of his two brothers to be listed as the owners in British racecards, he was told this was not possible because there was limited space to display owner names. Redvers contrasted that with the situation in Australia and Japan, saying many horses there have dozens of owners, all of them named in racecards. He noted also that British tracks often place a limit on the number of syndicate members who can receive free entry to see their horse run. The British Horseracing Authority did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It is believed the ruling body has been working on cutting back the red tape faced by owners. Tuesday\u2019s best bets The fact that Lingfield have plastered \u201cRACING GOES AHEAD\u201d above their online morning update tells you everything about conditions there. The going can be measured in fathoms and the races are to be timed with a calendar. I have every hope that the Southwell-winning mare Dashing Poet (4.00) will have the strength and resilience for this test. She comes from the in-form yard of Heather Main but is down to 6-5 because of a significant non-runner. Conditions will be less testing at Salisbury, where Brancaster (4.45) might be worth chancing at 10-1. He is still on a fair mark after two wins at the end of last season and a fibrillating heart explains his flop at Newbury last month. The Ian Williams revival suggests Dr Doro (7.20) might be worth a look at Thirsk, for which she\u2019s 20-1 after two modest efforts to start her year. The visor returns and the booking of PJ McDonald is interesting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
