Michael Dosunmu, described by police as an \"innocent boy\", was murdered by two gunmen who burst into his family's home in Peckham in the early hours of Tuesday. The men, understood to be in their 20s, were being questioned at police stations in south London yesterday. Detectives believe the killing may have been a case of mistaken identity. Police said two men forced their way into Michael's house just before 1am in what they described as \"a targeted attack\". Michael's older sister was at home and gave first aid but he died in hospital. Yesterday well-wishers left flowers at the teenager's house as police continued the search for clues. Michael's mother was on holiday in Nigeria at the time of the attack and his father, Rasak Dosunmu, was due to break the news to her when she arrived back in the UK. Yesterday friends and neighbours described Michael as \"quiet, gentle, honest and easy going\". The shooting follows another in Peckham at the weekend when a man in his 40s was shot dead and a second injured in the early hours of Sunday. Another teenager was shot dead on Sunday at an ice rink in nearby Streatham. Orando Madden, 23, from Peckham has been charged with the murder of Javarie Crighton and is due to appear at the Old Bailey on May 16."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
