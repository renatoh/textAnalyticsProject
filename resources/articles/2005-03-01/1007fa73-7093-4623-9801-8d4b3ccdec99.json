After visits to Madrid, London and New York which strained the members' powers of imagination as much as their appetite for Powerpoint presentations, they finally saw a stadium ready to stage an Olympic games. The Stade de France was looking far from its best yesterday, with the athletics track still covered and the pitch showing signs of recent rugby matches. There was no escaping the fact, however, that the French capital is unique among the five candidate cities in possessing a completed centrepiece stadium and one with a track record of hosting major international sporting events. Last month in Madrid the commission heard about plans to upgrade an existing stadium, a plan similar to Moscow's. In London and New York, Nawal El Moutawakel and her team could view only computer graphics and waste ground aching for transformation. Not so in the French capital, where the venue for the 1998 World Cup final is regularly cited by the Paris team as one of the main reasons why the Olympics should come to France. After the nerve-shredding build-up to Athens, Paris offers a low-risk alternative. This was a seductive argument when Lausanne was constructing the guidelines for this bid in the shadow of Athens' problems, but with that nightmare behind them it is far from certain that the IOC members will want to take such a cautious approach. IOC members are fond of the notion that the games bequeath something fresh to the cities they visit, and it is this desire for a big vision which London hopes to exploit. Increasingly Sebastian Coe and his team are stressing the \"sporting legacy\" of their bid. Paris's bid rests on the two venue \"clusters\" seven miles apart and equidistant from a new Olympic village, the site of which the evaluation commission visited yesterday. In addition to the Stade de France, the Paris plan makes extensive use of existing venues, complemented by four permanent new facilities - a velodrome, aquatic centre, a shooting centre and indoor arena - and temporary pavilions which would be taken down after the games. It is a plan that aims to avoid white elephants and outrageous expense - the budget is \u20ac4.2bn (\u00a32.9bn). In the northern \"cluster\" the Stade de France will host the opening and closing ceremonies and the athletics. Yesterday bid officials dismissed concerns that the stadium will be 14 years old by 2012 and reports that the International Association of Athletics Federations criticised the arrangements for the 2003 world championships at the stadium, including transport, ticketing and VIP arrangements. This site is more scatter than cluster and will bring its own security headache with a perimeter of about six miles and an autoroute running through the middle. In the west, existing venues with a rich heritage will be used. They include the Parc des Princes for football, Roland Garros for tennis, parts of the racecourses at Auteuil and Longchamp for equestrian events and archery, and the Croix Catelan, site of the Raceing Club de Paris, venue for Paris's 1900 Olympics. In a clear appeal to historians on the IOC membership, this last site will host the modern pentathlon, chosen discipline of the modern games' founder, Pierre de Coubertin. The evaluation commission were treated to a first-hand test of Paris's promise that the two sites are less than 10 minutes apart as police outriders sped them through city streets clogged by extra traffic as a result of yesterday's strikes. They are likely to have heard a great many speeches as they did so. One of the striking differences between this bid and London's is the greater number of politicians directly involved. It is a graphic display of political support but can make for slow going, and the commission can expect more presentations today before dinner at the Elys\u00e9es Palace with President Chirac."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
