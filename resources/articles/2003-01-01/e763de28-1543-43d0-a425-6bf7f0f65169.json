Primary schools are under enormous pressure to produce results in the tests, and this can mean the rest of the curriculum is put on hold. Lots of schools also provide extra classes for cramming. Teachers as well as parents are unhappy with the situation; a survey carried out by the NUT found high levels of dissatisfaction among primary school teachers over the constraints that Sats put on to the rest of the curriculum. But because test results are the way the government holds schools accountable, there is extreme pressure on teachers and heads, and this is passed on to the children. Publicly drawing attention to your dissatisfaction is positive in itself; but I'm afraid there is very little else you can do other than discuss your anxieties with your daughter's headteacher. At home, play the workload down as much as possible, and give your daughter the opportunity to be creative: unfortunately, the current regime does stifle creativity. Cramming does work up to a point, but it doesn't give access to deep learning. Schools don't have to go down this route, though it is hard to resist. We have done research here at King's on more constructive ways to improve learning, and we have found that a reflective approach, where teachers and pupils work together to improve learning, does improve exam performance in the long run and motivates children to want to learn. Margaret Tulloch Campaign for State Education A useful argument might be this quote from the parents' section on the DfES website. \"All the national curriculum subjects are very important: they all contribute to your child's education in different ways. The national curriculum was introduced to make sure that all children are given a broad and balanced education. PE, for example, contributes to your child's physical development. Art and design and music give your child other experiences that help them to develop important skills, such as being creative.\" Contact your MP about the government's policy on league tables. To find out what is happening in other primary schools, as well as asking other local parents, you could contact your local parent governor representatives. Ask the LEA for contact details. PGRs are elected by parent governors to be a voice for parents at local level. Your school should have a home-school agreement; check to see if it makes any promises about a broad and rich curriculum. It could be a topic for discussion at the annual parents' meeting with governors. By September 2003 all schools will be required to have a complaints policy, which will provide an opportunity to raise concerns like this. CASE 020-8944 8206; www.casenet.org John Coe National Association for Primary Education Sadly this does happen in many schools. The publication of league tables based on Sats scores has led to a narrowing of the primary curriculum. There is too much emphasis on the test, and too little on the child. For the youngest children and for boys in particular, this can involve a degree of failure, and this makes for the worst possible start to year 7 and secondary school; the well- documented fall-off in performance at this stage may be due to too much cramming. It's difficult to persuade schools that concentrating on exam techniques doesn't improve scores; indeed, to an extent, it does. But it doesn't leave behind anything lasting. Recent research by HMI has produced evidence that a broad and balanced curriculum actually improves results in the long term. You have every right to raise your concerns with the headteacher and governors, perhaps even drawing their attention to the HMI report; its title is the Curriculum in Successful Primary Schools, reference number HMI 553, available via Ofsted. Meanwhile, the whole family can do all they can outside school to compensate for what is really a lack of educational opportunity. Visit museums, heritage sites and the library; play sport. You may find that other children and parents join in and even that the school may offer support! NAPE, tel 01604 647646. Coming next My son is aged nearly six.
