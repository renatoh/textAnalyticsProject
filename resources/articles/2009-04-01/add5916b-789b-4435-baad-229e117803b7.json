Uefa's president, Michel Platini, will hand the award to Charlton in a ceremony at Old Trafford at lunchtime. Platini said in a statement: \"Sir Bobby represents everything that is good about the game of football \u2013 fair play, respect and true loyalty \u2013 and he is a good example for future generations, both on and off the pitch.\" Charlton played for United from 1953 until 1973, was named European Footballer of the Year in 1966 and was a member of the United team that won the European Cup in 1968. He also played 106 times for England, winning the World Cup in 1966, and still holds his country's international scoring record with 49 goals. After becoming president in 2007 Platini decided he wanted to recognise former players with his award and his first was given last year to Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, the former Real Madrid player who scored in the first five European Cup finals for Real, all of which they won."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
