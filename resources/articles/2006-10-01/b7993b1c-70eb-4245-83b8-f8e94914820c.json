I recently saw the account had been credited with more than \u00a32,000, so I rang the bank for an explanation and was told a cheque had been paid into my account. Smile could not tell me who paid it in - I was told to keep the cash and they would let me know if anyone got in touch with them over the matter. The cheque was paid in more than a month ago - I don't check the account often as I am only paying off the overdraft. Surely someone would have been in touch if they were missing more than \u00a32,000? Smile does not seem bothered that the sum has been paid into my account by mistake. While the interest I am earning on it is nice, is there nothing the bank can do to track down who the money belongs to? I am pretty sure it's not me! GT A Well, pretty sure isn't 100% certain, so maybe this is actually some delightful windfall that you'd forgotten you had coming? As you say, however, this is more realistically an error. And a month isn't a long time for it to go unnoticed. In fact, the poor soul who accidentally paid \u00a32,000 into your account is probably frantically searching for it but hasn't got anywhere yet. All it takes is a slip of the pen (or a poor keystroke) for the wrong account to be credited, but it can take months to sort the problem out - I've had letters from the other side of this particular fence before. The bank can't really do anything until someone comes looking for the cash. But you do need to bear in mind that it still isn't yours, though if it remains unclaimed it will be yours eventually. In the meantime, it would make sense to start paying your \u00a35 a month into an instant access savings account so that when the \u00a32,000 is finally retrieved, and I find it unlikely that it won't be, you will have cash ready and waiting to pay off the overdraft that will take its place again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
