The milers Paco Boy and Ghanaati, and impressive two-year-old Canford Cliffs, showed at Ascot that they could hold their own at the highest level. Otherwise, Ascot results rather suggested there was a dearth of home-grown talent coming through. Even with Canford Cliffs it is difficult to take a long-term view. His six-lengths victory in the Coventry Stakes was all the more remarkable given how hard he pulled in the early stages, yet he only beat third-placed Rakaan by a similar margin as on his debut at Newbury. Single-figure quotes for Canford Cliffs winning next year's 2,000 Guineas are poor value. While Henrythenavigator did win both the Coventry and the Guineas in 2007\u20138, it is also worth recalling Three Valleys who was made favourite for the Guineas after winning the Coventry Stakes by eight lengths in 2003. He failed to train on. Whether or not selective watering was the reason, there was a draw bias on the straight course at Ascot and it changed as the week went on. You had to de drawn low in the Royal Hunt Cup on Wednesday, so special mention must be made of Lovelace who led home a small group on the far side and finished ninth overall. Twelve months ago Lovelace ran a similar race in the Buckingham Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot before going on to win the valuable mile handicap at Sandown on Coral-Eclipse day. Mark Johnston's five-year-old will be worth a close look if he turns out for the same race on Saturday week. Backers of Jimmy Styles, drawn low in Saturday's Wokingham, soon knew their fate, because the advantage had swung to the far-side runners. With the first three home drawn 28, 27 and 25, Markab did well to finish fourth in the much smaller group that raced stands side. He looks a natural for one of the big seven-furlong handicaps in the summer. Perhaps the ultimate proof that the straight course was riding slower on the near side by the final day of the meeting comes with the comparison of times between the Wokingham winner, High Standing, and the Golden Jubilee winner, Art Connoisseur. William Haggas's handicapper was 0.71sec faster than the Group One winner Art Connoisseur. That puts a question mark over the Golden Jubilee form, but Art Connoisseur emerges with a deal of credit for defying the slower stands' rail to hold off the late challenge of Cannonball. Michael Bell's colt won last season's Coventry Stakes and sprinting is clearly his game. That may prove to be the case with Canford Cliffs. For the notebook Highland Glen Royal Ascot 1m4f Given a more positive ride, Highland Glen may well have won the King George V Handicap. Dropped out, the colt came with a rattle in the short home straight to finish sixth. He is the sort Sir Michael Stoute will surely aim at a big prize at Glorious Goodwood. Silver Grecian Newmarket 7f Advance reports of this newcomer's ability proved spot on. Settled just off the pace, he quickened when asked and turned in a thoroughly professional job to win by four lengths. He should make his mark in decent company."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
