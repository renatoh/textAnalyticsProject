Twelve years have passed for Ulster and 11 for Northampton since they were Heineken Cup winners, but this is a quarter-final that should be approached respectfully. You don't make the last eight in 2011 lightly. And yet, you can't help but chuckle. This is a weekend of grand rugby, of Leinster against Leicester at Dublin's sparkling Aviva Stadium, of Biarritz and Perpignan transporting themselves deep into the spiritual heartlands of the Basque and Catalan peoples: to San Sebasti\u00e1n, a jewel of Europe's Atlantic coast, and Barcelona, giant of the Mediterranean. Northampton? Today they're playing at stadium:mk (sic) in Milton Keynes. It's a journey of 10 miles according to my distance-calculator.com, 15 for the Northampton Chronicle &amp; Echo, who wanted to put a little more distance between the destinations when, in 2008 and in a different sport, Northampton Town first played against the MK Dons (once Wimbledon FC) in League One. The tone seemed to be that Northampton had thousands of years of history; MK had Ikea and concrete cows. Relations are more neighbourly now, stadium:mk offering 22,000 seats, 7,000 more than the requirement for a Heineken Cup quarter-final. Franklin's Gardens, the Saints' historic home, cannot yet squeeze in 15,000, but really should by now have been some way down the path to doing so. At this point we risk turning into an impasse of planning, up which some officers of the council do not see in a deal with a well-known supermarket chain the same benefits for the town centre as the rugby club sees for the increase in capacity at their ground. So, MK has Ikea; Northampton for the moment has no Asda round the back of the rugby club. And what on earth has this to do with today's game? Well, stadium:mk, however near or near-ish, is hardly home and any advantage in this age of maximising small margins should be seized. It is a blotch on the canvas of the English rugby club scene. Ulster won the Heineken Cup in a season notable for the absence of the English clubs. 1999 was the second of their two boycotts in the restless early years of professionalism, when the clubs and the Rugby Football Union vied for control of the paid players. And what has any of that got to do with today's game? Well, the peace treaty eventually hammered out between the clubs and Twickenham granted England first use of the best players at certain times of the year. In short, during the recent Six Nations Northampton did not have their international players available for the Aviva Premiership. Between 12 February and 6 March, they were without Ben Foden, Chris Ashton, Dylan Hartley, Tom Wood and Scotland's Joe Ansbro. They slumped to four consecutive Premiership defeats, against Saracens, Bath, Gloucester and Exeter. It led to the club benefactor, Keith Barwell, sneering at the salary cap. If availability is a blot on the season, so is the salary cap. Not much needs to go wrong for grievances to resurface. With the stars back, however, the Saints recovered. In recent weeks they have had wins over Leeds, Wasps and Sale. Hartley continues to be the most accurate line-out thrower in the Premiership; Christian Day steals more as a jumper at the same set piece; Wood makes more tackles than anyone; James Downey is as forthright as anyone in the centre, and Foden is never out of the news. The strength of the Saints is nevertheless beyond these individual merits. Jim Mallinder, their coach, has recruited well, partly thanks to the scouting work of Steve Diamond, with whom he formerly worked at Sale. While coach of Russia, and before he returned as head coach to his old club in Manchester, Diamond steered Brian Mujati, Brett Sharman and Juandre Kruger towards Mallinder. And Mallinder handed them over to the tender care of his forwards coach, Dorian West, ex-hooker of Leicester and England. Kruger may have gone back to the Bulls in South Africa, but West has blended all his other charges into a unit that, when at full strength, may be the best pack in Europe. Mujati, Hartley and Soane Tonga'uiha scrummage like a French front row. Day, who never really made a huge impact at Sale, has become a tower of strength in the second row, alongside the more recognised Courtney Lawes. The back row of Phil Dowson, Roger Wilson (once of Ulster) and Wood is a model of selflessness: nothing flash, but very efficient. The Northampton pack has everything to do with the game against Ulster, especially as the visitors are still without their talisman, Stephen Ferris, whose knee problem is becoming chronic. The background landscape may be blotchy, but the characters in the foreground should claim all the attention on Northampton's day out in Milton Keynes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
