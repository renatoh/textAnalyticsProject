As the parent of a trans child, I find this hugely disappointing. I have two teenage daughters. Their dad is Catholic, and they\u2019ve been raised in the Catholic faith. When our youngest came out as transgender, we struggled. This was five years ago, and there was limited coverage of trans people in the media. We struggled in our own minds \u2013 how can our child know so young? What if she\u2019s wrong? What does this mean? We struggled with our families \u2013 unsure of how to tell them, or indeed how they would react. We struggled with our church \u2013 would we still be welcome? Should we find a different one? A different school? I met with the senior leadership team of our Catholic primary school to discuss support. I also sat with our parish sister, and talked over many cups of coffee. Her response has stayed with me. \u201cWe are talking about a child. There will be people who don\u2019t understand. The world is changing, and the church can be slow to catch up. But your child should be treated with love, compassion and kindness. Who are we to turn our backs on her?\u201d Staff at the primary school explained to fellow pupils, in an age-appropriate way, why our child would be using a different name and pronouns after the school holiday. The only change at this stage is a social one \u2013 there is no medical intervention. I contacted some of the parents. Messages of support came flooding back. The year after her social transition, we flew to Ireland for a wedding. This would be the first time that many aunts, uncles and cousins (as well as my 86-year-old mother-in-law) had met our daughter as her true authentic self. Again, as parents we were nervous. These are the people we care about most in the world; how would they respond to our child? The love from family was overwhelming. There will always be those who do not understand, but I saw the relief my daughter felt at being accepted and not ridiculed. Every day I see her thrive and grow in confidence. I am proud of her. My child\u2019s transition has not led to the \u201cdestabilisation of the family institution\u201d. If anything, family bonds are stronger. Her relationship with her grandparents is a joy to behold. She and her sister argue (most siblings do), but there is a closeness that was missing previously. I\u2019ve thought long and hard about why that is. Honestly? She is no longer pretending to be someone she is not. She can relax and be herself. The Vatican says you can\u2019t choose your gender. Trans and non-binary people don\u2019t \u201cchoose\u201d their gender. They know who they are, and they wish to live authentically and happily. What I will say is that families, friends, communities and congregations can choose how to respond. In our case, they have responded with love, compassion and respect, even when they don\u2019t understand. As I said at the start, I have two teenage daughters. Both now attend our local Catholic secondary school. Both are thriving and happy. Pope Francis envisions an inclusive church \u2013 our experience as a family is a reminder that God welcomes all, even and especially those whom society rejects. Our community is made up of people living their faith with compassion through their actions. That, to me, is true Christianity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
