Composer and pianist Joep Beving, 41, has become a one-man recording phenomenon, and will give his first concert in Britain this week after a breakthrough into the big time. Beving, who lives in Amsterdam, performed and recorded his \u201cmood music\u201d album, Solipsism, for the enjoyment of his family. Then, partly for fun, he made it available on music-streaming service Spotify. He never imagined that the contemplative, atmospheric piano tunes would draw such a vast audience worldwide. But such was the popularity of Solipsism that four record companies were soon fighting over him, and he has now been signed by Deutsche Grammophon (DG). A follow-up album, Prehension, was released last month. Speaking to the Observer last week, Beving said: \u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming. Very surreal.\u201d Christian Badzura, a DG senior executive in Germany, said Beving has become \u201cone of the most listened-to living pianists in the world\u201d and the 85 million streaming count was very impressive. \u201cIt proves,\u201d he said, \u201cthat if you compose good music you have the chance to connect with people immediately. The music does the talking \u2013 in the streaming world as well as in physical sales. Now, with the support of a world-renowned label, he is extending his reach. \u201cFor classical music, this is a really big number. A lot of pianists who interpret Chopin or Beethoven accumulate big numbers. But for just one person with his own composition, it\u2019s very much on the top.\u201d Badzura is DG\u2019s director of new repertoire, with a portfolio that includes Max Richter, the chart-topping composer whose work includes major film scores such as Martin Scorsese\u2019s Shutter Island. He first heard Beving\u2019s music by chance when a vinyl copy of Solipsism was playing in a late-night bar in Berlin. One of Beving\u2019s German advertising friends had left it with the barman. Badzura recalled: \u201cAt 2am, I happened to hear that record. I was mesmerised. It transformed the whole place. Beautiful music.\u201d He approached the barman, who put him in touch with Beving\u2019s friend: \u201cI contacted her and said, \u2018I need to meet Joep: his music is wonderful,\u2019 not knowing Beving was already huge in the digital space.\u201d At nearly 6ft 10in, with wild hair and a flowing beard, Beving has a physique in stark contrast with the delicacy of his music. DG likens him to \u201cthe gentlest of giants, his delicate melodies soothing the soul in these troubled times\u201d. Badzura said the apparent simplicity of Beving\u2019s music leaves \u201cso much space for the imagination and the mind to travel. It\u2019s brilliantly done. This music gives you the opportunity to slow down, contemplate and listen to melody again. It\u2019s just an upright piano. But the way it\u2019s recorded, engineered and mixed, it sounds so big. \u201cIt didn\u2019t need anything electronic or further instrumentation. That makes it really special.\u201d Tracks on the second album have titles such as A Heartfelt Silence. Beving said that, while his music uses a \u201cclassical vocabulary\u201d, it is aimed more at a pop audience. \u201cIt\u2019s chill-out, easy listening \u2026 mood-type music for people to calm down and feel comforted, like being in a bubble, protected.\u201d His influences include Philip Glass, the American minimalist composer. Beving\u2019s success is more extraordinary because he had been turned down by the only record label he approached, and had to pay to press 1,500 vinyl copies of Solipsism. \u201cI wanted to make something tangible,\u201d he said. By day he used to work as an advertising manager for a company that provides music for commercials. He worked on his debut album in his kitchen at night, while his girlfriend and two young daughters were asleep. Music has been a passion of Beving\u2019s since childhood. The son of a schoolteacher, he formed his first band at the age of 14. He later won a place at a conservatoire, but repetitive strain injury to his wrist forced him to abandon his piano studies after a year. Instead, he studied public policy and administration. Now, 20 years on, the wrist has healed. He said: \u201cIf I don\u2019t overdo the playing, it\u2019s fine. The music I play is not technically advanced.\u201d He has now made enough money to quit his day job. \u201cTo be able to support my family and go to a studio and write music is an extreme luxury,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t calculating on this and am truly grateful for technological developments opening up the music market and making it more democratic.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
