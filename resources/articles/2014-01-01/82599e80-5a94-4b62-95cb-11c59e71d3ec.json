While economists have puzzled over the figures, car dealers have provided a more prosaic answer: people are driving off in shiny new vehicles paid for out of \u00a317bn in PPI windfalls (and maybe more, given RBS's latest provisions). Now that shareholders have approved the \u00a379bn Vodafone/Verizon sale, are we about to witness another giant cash injection into the economy? The deal will see Vodafone deliver a huge dividend, worth around \u00a351bn. Around \u00a336bn will be in Verizon shares, and, although they are widely rated as a \"buy\", few small shareholders are likely to hold on to them, especially as Vodafone is operating a free dealing facility for those with up to 50,000 shares, which is open until 4 April. On 4 March shareholders will be flooded with \u00a315bn of cold, hard cash in the biggest ever payout to UK investors. Another bonanza for car dealers, sofa makers and kitchen fitters? Maybe. Even currency dealers are expecting a surge in support for sterling, with so much cash flowing across the Atlantic. Some 60% of the money will go to institutional shareholders, led by Legal &amp; General, Scottish Widows and Fidelity. They will be mulling over what to do with this wall of cash. Some will be ploughed back into what is lining up to be a bumper year for IPOs, with businesses including TSB, Poundland and Saga all heading to the London market. There are 490,000 small Vodafone shareholders in the UK and Ireland, currently grappling with the 160-page document sent to them. Precise figures are impossible to give with the share price fluctuating, but roughly speaking for each \u00a31,000 worth of Vodafone shares, investors will receive \u00a3200 in cash, \u00a3264 in Verizon shares and \u00a3536 in Vodafone shares. What will they do with the money? Unlike the low-income households that were the chief beneficiaries of PPI compensation - and who have an understandably high marginal propensity to spend every penny they get \u2013 the shareholders in Vodafone aren't likely to be so hard-pressed. So sorry, car dealers, this is unlikely to translate into even more sales. The major retail financial advisers, such as Hargreaves Lansdown and Killik Stockbrokers, are telling clients that Verizon is a 'buy' or even a 'strong buy' but with the free dealing facility and an aversion to holding non-sterling investments, most small shareholders will cash out or switch back into Vodafone, whose yield will be attractive to those suffering poor returns on deposit accounts. The biggest headache for many is not how to spend the windfall, but how to avoid tax on it. The short answer: choose the B shares and take advantage of your \u00a310,900 capital gains tax allowance. Long answer: see an accountant."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
