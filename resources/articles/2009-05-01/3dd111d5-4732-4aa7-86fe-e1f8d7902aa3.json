Like that work, The Seasons was based on an English-language source, but it has never enjoyed the popularity of its predecessor. Certainly the libretto, a German translation of extracts from James Thomson's lengthy poem, has its weaknesses. But the depiction of rustic life in the score, whose musical roots stretch back to Handel's pastorals and oratorios, as well as echoing Mozart's Magic Flute, is unlike anything else in Haydn's vast output. It may sometimes be a bit coarse-grained, even twee - the composer famously complained about having to write a chorus of frogs in the Summer section of the work - but the best of the music is fondly nostalgic, an old man's serene contemplation of youthful pleasure. That gentle affection comes through clearly in Nikolaus Harnoncourt's performance, which catches the conductor at his most serene. There's none of the radical reinterpretation Harnoncourt so often applies to his performances of 18th- and 19th-century works, just a beautifully measured unfolding of the score with the period instruments of his own Concentus Musicus Wien, together with an expert chorus and a beautifully matched trio of soloists. The baritone Christian Gerhaher is particularly outstanding."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
