Sandwiched between a Nandos and a run of 24-hour supermarkets, it's a delightfully baroque old hall, with ridiculously high ceilings to aid sound clarity, and a separate bar to keep the natterers out of earshot. There's a whiff of wedding reception venue about it, which only adds to it's charms, whilst the list of previous performers reads like a who's who of modern music, from the Sugababes to R.E.M. via The Killers. \u2022 Bush Hall, 310 Uxbridge Road W12, +44 (0)20-8222 6955, bushhallmusic.co.uk Madame JoJo's Situated on Brewer Street in the heart of London's Soho, Madame JoJo's was initially just another nightclub in the Soho portfolio of porn baron and property magnate Paul Raymond. When Raymond revamped the Whitehall Theatre he moved its art deco fittings over to Madame JoJo's, giving it a simultaneously glitzy and gaudy feel. Descending downstairs feels like entering a 1970s vision of decadence \u2013 all red and gold sequinned drapes, geometric railings and carpeted walls. Its weekly club night, White Heat, is a showcase for new bands. \u2022 8-10 Brewer Street W1, +44 (0)20-7734 3040, madamejojos.com Union Chapel Increasingly, churches and chapels in London are being used as venues for musical worship. This Grade II listed church in Islington (built in 1877) was Time Out live venue of the year in 2002 and has become a popular venue for intimate concerts. Famed for its breathtaking gothic interior, complete with octagonal-shaped chapel, exposed stone walls and wraparound balconies, it's also lauded for its quality of sound and pin-drop acoustics. Since 2006, the chapel has hosted the annual Little Noise Sessions, featuring stripped-back sets by the likes of Amy Winehouse, Florence and the Machine (pictured), and Coldplay. \u2022 Compton Avenue N1, +44 (0)20-7359 4019, unionchapel.org.uk The Lexington An imposing corner pub situated between the sophistication of Islington and the seediness of Kings Cross, The Lexington is a curious mix of American-style lounge bar and old English pub. A giant chandelier hangs in the main bar, while an animal skull gazes down from one of the walls. The downstairs area is relaxed and luxurious, the upstairs room sweaty, heaving and generally well lubricated. The atmosphere is superb, nurturing a genuine rapport between band and crowd. \u2022 96-98 Pentonville Road N1, +44 (0)20-7837 5371, thelexington.co.uk Cafe Oto In a vibrant arts community such as Dalston, it takes a lot for a venue to stand out. Cafe Oto \u2013 opened in April 2008 \u2013 has quickly established itself as a venue for music that exists on the periphery of the mainstream, with recent gigs including sound artists Rolf Julius and Miki Yui, and musique concr\u00e8te legends Ghedelia Tazartes. It's minimal quality (white walls and no stage to speak of) allows bands the freedom to express themselves without having a \"vibe\" imposed on them. \u2022 18-22 Ashwin Street E8, +44 (0)20-7923 1231, cafeoto.co.uk Tabernacle From its red-brick curved facade and Victorian gothic turrets to its open steel beams and pull-out tier seating, the Tabernacle \u2013 situated in a leafy Notting Hill street \u2013 is a hugely versatile venue. In the 1960s and 70s, it hosted Pink Floyd and The Clash; recent performers have included Lily Allen and Adele. Managed by the Carnival Village Trust, Wom@TT (World Of Music @ The Tabernacle) aims to promote London-based African, Caribbean and Latin musicians. Recent performers have included Bumi Thomas and Amaziah, as well as Mobo award-winning saxophonist Yolanda Brown. \u2022 35 Powis Square W11, +44 (0)20-7221 9700, tabernaclew11.com Cecil Sharp House Nestled between Regent's Park and the townhouses of Camden Town, and hidden away behind a wall of oak trees, Cecil Sharp House (named after the founding father of the folklore revival) looms into view like an old school hall; all wood-panelled walls, high ceilings and single-glazed windows that rattle in the wind. As the headquarters of the English Folk Dance and Song Society, it promotes all aspects of English folk, from clog and morris dancing to supporting undiscovered new folk talent such as Andy Cutting and Steve Knightley. \u2022 2 Regent's Park Road NW1, +44 (0)20-7485 2206, efdss.org The Vortex Aiming to dispel the myth that jazz is only for people of a certain age with a penchant for saying \"nice\", The Vortex brings contemporary jazz to Dalston with seven evening performances a week. Housed inside what looks like a futuristic greenhouse jutting out of a newly built block of flats, it's a relaxed \u2013 if slightly peculiar \u2013 mishmash of ideas. The lower floor is a hotchpotch of different styles and influences, while the upper level sticks to an uncluttered minimalism. Some of the biggest names in jazz have played here, from the late Sir John Dankworth to Mercury prize-nominated quintet Polar Bear. \u2022 11 Gillett Square N16, +44 (0)20-7254 4097, vortexjazz.co.uk Plan B Reopened in October 2009 by Hot Chip following a huge revamp, Brixton's Plan B has become one of the most talked about venues in London. The space is fitted with a Funktion 1 sound system (loud and really clear), neon strip lighting and a warehouse-style interior, and has a 24-hour licence, so things can carry on into the night once the live music finishes. Since its relaunch, has played host to DJ sets from LCD Soundsystem, Basement Jaxx and Skream, plus a live set from James Blake. \u2022 418 Brixton Road SW9, +44 (0)20-7733 0926, plan-brixton.co.uk Barbican The famous classical and contemporary music venue and home of the London Symphony Orchestra also houses theatre performances, film screenings and art exhibitions. Prepare to be struck by how crisp and clear the acoustics are, in spite of the vastness of the 2,000-capacity main hall. It's for this reason that a large number of contemporary acts choose to work through their songs with extra orchestral embellishment, as Antony and the Johnsons (pictured) did in 2008, or strip everything back to the bare bones. \u2022 Silk Street EC2, +44 (0)20-7638 8891, barbican.org.uk \u2022 Michael Cragg is features editor at popjustice.com and writes a daily New Music blog for the Guardian"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
