As a nation whose traumatic past is still coming to light \u2013 through victims\u2019 previously untold stories or even the discovery of their unburied bones \u2013 it is safe to say Ireland remains a haunted place. The landscape isn\u2019t short on haunted vibes, either \u2013 between the ravaged fields and the dilapidated houses; the bogs bloated fat with the mulch of history. There is also our unique relationship with the supernatural \u2013 not just the churchy stuff, but all the myth and superstition. We can be fierce believers in the sinister. Four years ago, I started writing The Butchers, a novel set in the borderlands during the 1996 BSE crisis. Ireland\u2019s dark folktales clash with its modern aspirations, while the threat of \u201cmad cow disease\u201d ghosts across the land. Here are 10 \u201cIrish gothic\u201d offerings from which I drew eerie inspiration: 1. The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde (1890) Over the course of the 19th century, Irish gothic spawned the immortal (quite literally) figures of Count Dracula and Melmoth the Wanderer. My favourite of the shady old-schoolers, however, has to be Dorian Gray, who sells his soul for a life of eternal youth and decadent pleasure. A possessed portrait, the emergence of the suppressed \u2013 these had long been gothic staples. But for Wilde, the result was much more sinister. The novel\u2019s homosexual allusions were later used as evidence when he was convicted of gross indecency; most sinister of all, it would be another century before homosexuality in Ireland was officially decriminalised. 2. The Butcher Boy by Patrick McCabe (1992) The dysfunctional tale of Francie Brady \u2013 a border-town native growing up in the 1960s \u2013 is not for the fainthearted. We follow Francie from childhood (cue alcoholic father and suicidal mother), through to industrial school (cue abusive priests), all the way to working life in an abattoir (cue a lot of dismembered pig carcasses). A disturbing portrait of a disintegrating mind, The Butcher Boy gave rise to the phrase \u201cbog gothic\u201d and revealed the sordid realities that often lurked behind romanticised depictions of rural Ireland. 3. Other Words for Smoke by Sarah Maria Griffin (2019) Griffin\u2019s second novel for young adults is laced with gothic tropes \u2013 a pair of twins, an eccentric great aunt, a banjaxed old house creaking with mysteries (not to mention some exceptionally malevolent wallpaper). It is also a beautiful coming-of-age story and a fierce attack on archaic attitudes towards reproductive rights and the incarceration of women. Griffin is among a number of stellar YA authors (check out Deirdre Sullivan, too) using witchcraft and fantasy to engage with the horrors of Ireland\u2019s not-too-distant past. 4. No Bones by Anna Burns (2001) Turning to the North, Burns is best known for her \u201cdifficult\u201d (or just inventively brilliant) Booker prize-winning Milkman. Her debut, No Bones, was also a darkly comic tale about a young Belfast woman. Amelia Lovett \u2013 who reads like the female answer to Francie Brady \u2013 struggles with the inherited curse of Troubles violence and ultimately suffers a complete psychological breakdown. A former Sinn F\u00e9in figure dismissed Burns\u2019s novel as a \u201cmisanthropic portrayal [\u2026] completely blown by its surrealist affectations\u201d, but it is the book\u2019s idiosyncratic voice that makes it such a unique take on the legacies of trauma. 5. By the Bog of Cats by Marina Carr (1998) Carr\u2019s reworking of Euripides\u2019s Medea begins with Hester Swane dragging a dead black swan across the stage. Rejected by her former lover (and baby daddy) on account of her \u201ctinker\u201d blood, Hester has been banished from her beloved bogland so that he can remarry in peace. But Hester is waiting for her mother \u2013 the witchlike Josie Swane \u2013 to return. Anyone familiar with Medea knows things don\u2019t end tremendously well. Combining gothic fears of the barbaric other with Ireland\u2019s longstanding aversion to female autonomy, Carr creates a world in which occult forces offer the only means of escape (not to mention a script that is so compelling you can read it like a novel and be spooked). 6. Himself by Jess Kidd (2016) If all this talk of repressed suffering and hidden wounds is sounding a bit grim, Kidd\u2019s debut manages to be both gothic and great craic. Having grown up in a priest-ridden orphanage, handsome devil Mahony now returns to the small Mayo town of his birth to investigate his mother\u2019s untimely death. The cast of local misfits he encounters are a hoot, as are their predecessors, for Kidd brings to (half) life the town\u2019s quirky legions of ghosts; Mahony charms them all, the living and the dead. 7. Dark Lies the Island by Kevin Barry (2012) Barry\u2019s second collection, with a title that Irish gothic could do well to nick as its tagline) features a spectacular host of oddballs \u2013 from aspiring terrorists to real-ale enthusiasts and the rampantly horny staff of an edge-of-the-world hotel. Even the rain is \u201cparticularly violent\u201d, falling \u201clike handfuls of nails flung hard and fast by a seriously riled sky god\u201d. The image conjures Barry himself, hurling his spiky prose across the page, channelling modern depravities and pagan rites with a wicked smirk. 8. The Wych Elm by Tana French (2019) Given that Irish gothic is so often concerned with uncovering ancient transgressions, it is no surprise that crime writers have thrown some baleful bangers into the mix. The first standalone novel by Tana French \u2013 author of the Dublin Murder Squad series \u2013 features a skeleton, not in the closet, but in the trunk of a gnarled old tree. Starring Toby Hennessy, a Dublin art-world type who has recently returned to his family\u2019s country pile, The Wych Elm is also an examination of male privilege and how secrets can be passed down from one damaged generation to the next. 9. Nothing on Earth by Conor O\u2019Callaghan (2017) For a while, it seemed the dark times were over \u2013 the Celtic Tiger was roaring and, for many, it felt time to leave the past behind (as if, somehow, it could be so easy). Then came the financial crash, and Ireland was transformed into a country of \u201cghost estates\u201d and \u201czombie banks\u201d, haunted all over again by the spectre of its own arrogance. Nothing on Earth is set on one such estate where, amid the eerily empty houses, a young girl shows up on a priest\u2019s doorstep. O\u2019Callaghan creates an atmosphere of such intense unease your heart will be going like the clappers. 10. A World of Love by Elizabeth Bowen (1954) At first, this seems like just another of the gothic wartime tales for which Bowen was famous. On closer inspection, it gives the genre an unexpected twist. After the death of her cousin Guy, Antonia inherits an old estate \u2013 you know the drill \u2013 a crumbling house in the middle of nowhere with letters hidden in the attic full of secrets . Over the course of the novel, these secrets are revealed and Guy\u2019s memory is acknowledged and mourned in full, affording the other characters, eventually, a degree of peace. In this way, Bowen demonstrates how Ireland could come to terms with its troubled history; how it might exorcise its demons in order to look forward to the future with something, perhaps, resembling hope. \u2022 The Butchers by Ruth Gilligan is published by Atlantic Books."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
