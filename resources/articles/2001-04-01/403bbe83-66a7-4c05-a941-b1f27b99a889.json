The Liverpool company, which six months ago looked on the way to success with a record order book of \u00a3750m ran into trouble in November when an Italian company suddenly cancelled a \u00a350m cruise ship contract. The final crunch came as Cammell failed to win support from the Royal Bank of Scotland to help pay the first instalment on an \u00a378m bond issue which fell due this weekend. RBS refused to comment on why it had pulled the plug on the Merseyside company. \"Confidentiality would preclude this,\" said a bank spokesman. Meanwhile Cammell's board issued a formal statement saying: \"The directors of the group will continue to provide whatever assistance they can to the receivers to protect the future prospects of the business and safeguard jobs.\" Union officials from the AEEU described the actions of the Scottish bank as \"clearly unhelpful\". Labour leaders hope to meet the receiver, thought to be PricewaterhouseCoopers, as soon as possible ahead of trying to win a purchaser for shipyards at Birkenhead on Merseyside and Hebburn on Tyneside. Cammell also controls a range of repair yards abroad, including those in Marseilles, Gibraltar and Portland, Oregon which employ a further 1,700 workers. Already last night there were unconfirmed reports circulating that a German company might be willing to buy Cam mell, which was established in 1824 and built the HMS Ark Royal. Shares in the company have plunged from a high of 140p in January 2000 and were suspended yesterday at 6p. While the decision by Costa Crociere to cancel delivery was the main blow, Cammell also pointed out it had failed to obtain government funding for a potential $500m (\u00a3340m) contract from new cruise venture, Luxus. Cammell managers blamed some of its woes on the Ministry of Defence placing a six-ship order at Flensburg in Germany and Harland &amp; Wolff in Belfast. The Department of Trade and Industry said it would be working with the receiver to try to find a buyer for the facilities. It expressed concern for the employees and their families but sidestepped any suggestion of its own blame. \"It is clear that Cammell Laird has difficulties due to commercial decisions... most notably the loss of the [Italian] contract.\" Labour MPs and unions were quick to demand government help for Cammell and contrasted official reluctance to provide decent levels of aid support to shipbuilders with help provided to the stricken farming community. Birkenhead's Labour MP, Frank Field, said: \"The paradox is that the yard is full of ships, there are 280 apprentices. There is a short-term cash flow problem because of the risks it took trying to break into the cruise market.\" \u0095 Political efforts will continue this week to save the Motorola plant at Bathgate, West Lothian, from closure with the loss of more than 3,000 jobs, writes Kirsty Scott . The company had been expected to announce yesterday that it was closing the mobile phone facility because of a slump in demand, but intervention by the prime minister and Scottish executive ministers has reportedly brought about a stay of execution."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
