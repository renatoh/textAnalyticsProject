The provocative subject would explain the high turnout. More than a hundred members of greater Birmingham's middle-management community have come to the Britannia suite in the National Motorcycle Museum to hear Lilian speak on Dealing Effectively With Unacceptable Employee Behaviour, or what might be more succinctly termed Safe Sacking. \"How many of you work with very difficult people?\" she asks. About two-thirds of the room raises a hand. Some of the folks are dressed in casual away-day clothes, and seem happy just to be out of the office. Others are clearly seeking advice about handling difficult workers more effectively. Some have come to learn how to sack people. A few appear to have come with the goal of terminating a specific employee in the next 48 hours. \"Termination is not the goal,\" says Lilian. \"It is a result.\" This semantic hair-splitting produces a Mexican wave of sincere nods. SkillPath Seminars, who are running this show, have provided each of us with a SkillPacket, which includes a workbook, a name tag and a Certificate of Attendance, pre-signed by SkillPath's president. The 9am-to-4pm seminar (with two breaks and an hour for lunch) is lightly interactive. We are occasionally broken up into groups of twos and threes to tackle an exercise, and then asked to speak about it. I have an obvious reason for not wanting to do this. I don't have any employees to sack, and I never have. I don't manage anyone, or possess any people skills. In fact I'm already identifying more with the unacceptable employee behaviour of such stereotypes as the Loner, the Clock-Watcher, the Whiner, the Insubordinate Subordinate, Blameless Bob and the Tortoise. I tick 'em all off as we go: been there, done that, got the sack. Luckily the man next to me doesn't seem any more interested in doing the exercises than I am. He works for National Air Traffic Services (Nats), and he wants a cigarette. At one point, when we are supposed to be discussing a profile we have made of a difficult employee in our charge (I have done mine for my dog. On the positive side I've written \"loyal\"), I ask him what he thinks of the course. \"It's not quite what I imagined,\" he says. I know what he means. It's all very informative, but there isn't enough stuff about disciplining people or giving them the chop. Although the seminar has been sold (at \u00a399 for the day, lunch not included) as a sacking lesson, much of the morning is taken up with backing away from this premise. Zarzar declines to go into any detail about Blameless Bob or Amy Attitude, even though they're in the workbook. Instead we find ourselves learning to be better managers, to \"grow\" our employees, and to concentrate on our own deficiencies as motivators, as communicators, as listeners. With the help of an overhead projector, Zarzar defines a good manager as \"one who does all he or she can to help an organisation reach its goals by helping subordinates to be...\" That's as far as I got before she snatched the acetate away. We are introduced to some fairly basic personnel-wrangling skills, including the importance of communicating effectively, of documenting meetings accurately, of giving our employees positive as well as negative feedback. We scribble down the Three Commandments of Good Managers: 1) Observe, don't diagnose; 2) Document, don't guess; 3) Refer, Don't Counsel. It's not so much Safe Sacking as Chicken Soup for Your Staff. In the break someone tells Zarzar that a lot of this stuff is just plain common sense. \"Yes,\" she says, \"but it's not common practice.\" This is my first introduction to the parallel universe of management, and I'm struggling with all the jargon. Zarzar talks of Herzberg's Theory (\"Individuals are motivated not by failure, but by achievement\") and The Platinum Rule (\"Do unto others as they need to be done unto\"). Lots of the people raise their hands when she asks who has read books such as Seven Habits of Highly Effective Managers (Zarzar describes its author as \"a genius\") and Emotional Intelligence. The bibliography at the back of the workbook lists classic texts such as Fear of Firing and Why Employees Don't Do What They're Supposed to Do and What to Do About It. By the lunch break, a table with more books for sale has materialised at the back of the room. Business is brisk; copies of A Winning Attitude, Assert Yourself, Taking Charge, Dynamic Delegation and Meetings That Work are snatched up. \"I just read Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway,\" says someone behind me. I don't even know if that's one book or two. In the cafeteria I ask the man sitting next to me, a maintenance supervisor at a factory that makes radar-absorbent material, how he likes the seminar so far. \"It's not what I thought it was going to be like,\" he says. \"I thought it was going to be to do with handling difficult people.\" After lunch he gets his wish, more or less. There's a perceptible shift in tone, as Zarzar begins to tell the middle managers a bit more of what they want to hear. \"Supervising people is the most difficult thing you can do, apart from living with them,\" she says, to universal agreement. Asked what to do when problem workers become angry, she tells us, \"You're not responsible for their anger. You don't own that.\" She repeatedly compares employees to children, which, as a former difficult employee of long standing, I find a little offensive. In one exercise we pore over a case study involving Barbara, a sour, jumped-up jobsworth supervisor at City Central hospital who is giving the new lab technician, Michelle, a hard time. I am all for hauling Barbara before a tribunal but, across the room, people are leaping to her defence. I suppose they know better than I do. In the final hour, after one last book-buying break, Zarzar gets down to business. Sacking secrets are vouchsafed to those of us who have stayed the course (The Nats guy, I notice, has long since legged it). We are no longer learning to grow employees; we're learning to prune them. We have delicately negotiated the five steps of the Disciplinary Ladder, from Coaching, Verbal Warning and Performance Improvement up to Written Warning and Termination. We feel we have done everything we can. The room is silent as Zarzar introduces the subject of the Final Meeting. \"Do you have people cry?\" she asks us. \"Do you have them start crying?\" Yes, says the room, almost as one. She instructs us in the art of the \"Bump &amp; Run\" to deal with the weepy ones: touch on the issue, then hand them a tissue. \"We'll wait until you've stopped crying,\" she says. Yes, I think. That one always worked on me."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
