These include: why did these priests do such horrible things? How did they justify their crimes to themselves and to God? What kind of conversations may they have had with, say, their archbishop or monsignor, once they were rumbled by a parent or teacher or victim? Accounts from the paedophiles themselves that may go some way towards answering those questions are also missing from this narrative. Perhaps this is because paedophiles do not want to talk due to shame or due to the media\u2019s preference for \u2013 in some cases \u2013 giving victims airtime and denying a platform to abusers. And then there\u2019s us, the audience. Do we really want to hear from them? There are arguments for listening to perpetrators explain themselves. You can better understand the crime if you understand the criminal. And the Catholic church has for a long time been so opaque on matters of sexual abuse that any interview, no matter how painful to watch, is illuminating. The first episode of the three-part documentary Revelation is built around such an interview. ABC journalist Sarah Ferguson sits down with Fr Vincent Ryan (yes he is still a priest, yet to be defrocked despite his horrendous crimes against children) and tries to answer all these questions. Ryan is 80 now and has been accused of sexually abusing more than 30 boys aged from six to 17 from 1975 until 1995. He was jailed for 14 years for his crimes in 1997 and last year he was tried on two new charges. These charges form the backbone of the documentary \u2013 for the first time during an Australian criminal trial, the ABC were allowed to film. As well as interviewing Ryan (who pleaded not guilty), Ferguson speaks to two of the victims, the prosecution and defence barristers, as well as a psychiatrist who specialised in treating priests. The documentary doesn\u2019t make a promising start, opening with an introduction from Ferguson that is as purple as a priest\u2019s Lenten vestments: \u201cThere are men living among us, like Lucifer\u2019s fallen angels. It\u2019s their ordinariness that I find disturbing. They really should look like monsters to match their deeds.\u201d Lucifer\u2019s fallen angels? People that should look like monsters? Really? Luckily such flowery language is kept to a minimum and the old technique of \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d quickly takes over. And that\u2019s really all that\u2019s necessary, because there\u2019s a lot on show here that we haven\u2019t seen or heard before on our screens. Be warned \u2013 you\u2019ll need a strong stomach to digest it. Like, for example, Ryan\u2019s justification for molestation: \u201cAs far as I was concerned, I was in a relationship. I was getting the love and the human touch and belonging.\u201d And then there\u2019s the central crime itself. The victims \u2013 courageous men of strength and grace \u2013 tell us what happened to them. They don\u2019t spare us with the details, and why should they? Part of the problem, as the documentary points out, is that shame abounds. The victims suffer twice: from the act itself and then the silence and stigma after it. The victims were young altar boys. What alternate moral universe was Ryan living in? It was the universe of the Catholic church, a corrupt institution that moved paedophile priests around to avoid scandal, conveniently giving them a batch of fresh victims in each new parish; an institution that saw the children as \u201cinstruments of temptation\u201d rather than the innocent victims they were. Revelation starts off strange, becomes upsetting and is, finally, shocking. In some ways it mimics the mechanics of a jury trial: we, at home, hear all sides. There is no room for politeness or euphemism. The whole nasty, sorry business is laid out before us, and it\u2019s hard to remain with it, but there is a strong feeling that we must bear witness. The detail of the abuse is horrendous and I wish I hadn\u2019t heard it. But maybe as someone raised Catholic and still has some cultural affinity with the Irish branch of the church, I needed to. \u2022 Revelation airs in three parts on ABC TV, starting 17 March at 8.30pm"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
