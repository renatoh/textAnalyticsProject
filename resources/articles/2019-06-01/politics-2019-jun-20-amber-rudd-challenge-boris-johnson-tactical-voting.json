The work and pensions secretary, who is backing Hunt to be the next prime minister, said rumours that Johnson\u2019s campaign would use tactical voting to seek revenge on Gove for derailing his leadership campaign in 2016 were \u201cdiscrediting\u201d the system to select a party leader. Her comments came on the day when all 313 Tory MPs whittle down Johnson, Hunt, Gove and Sajid Javid to two candidates. The first ballot result is expected at 1pm and the second at around 6pm. The final two candidates will go on to the ballot paper to Conservative members. Rudd told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI find all this conversation about lending votes rather discrediting of the system. Each MP has a really important responsibility to think about who can deliver us from this real difficulty that we\u2019re in and who will be a prime minister. \u201cI would really call on Boris himself to repudiate the information that\u2019s coming out, friends of Boris saying this, saying one thing. This is a serious moment, we don\u2019t need that sort of game-playing going on in parliament.\u201d Responding to a question about whether Johnson would prefer to face Hunt in the final two instead of Gove, Rudd said the foreign secretary was confident about seeing off his predecessor to become prime minister. She said: \u201cWell, they\u2019re wrong because I know that Jeremy Hunt will make the right case, he\u2019ll be persuasive, and he\u2019ll be able to show that he has the experience and the skills to become the prime minister. So if that\u2019s their view, I say bring it on. I\u2019m longing to see Jeremy in the finals to be able to make the case as the future prime minister.\u201d Speaking an hour before the opening of voting, Hunt said the country was looking at Johnson and asking: \u201cIs there a better alternative?\u201d The foreign secretary said he was \u201cconfident but not overconfident\u201d of advancing to the members\u2019 vote. \u201cI need my supporters to come and say, \u2018Yes, we can do better than Boris Johnson as the next prime minister of our country, we can choose someone who the EU are actually going to talk to and get that better Brexit deal,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cMay the best man win, and that\u2019s going to be me.\u201d Andrea Jenkyns, a Brexiter MP who is backing Johnson, told ITV\u2019s Peston programme on Wednesday night that there would be \u201csome poetic justice\u201d if the bitter rivals were in the final runoff. She said that although there were \u201ctricks going on\u201d in the contest, Johnson\u2019s campaign was not to blame. Gove said: \u201cI do think I would be a better prime minister than Boris.\u201d But, he added, \u201che has formidable qualities and he is a big part of the Conservative party\u2019s and the country\u2019s future\u201d. While Johnson had \u201ccommunication skills aplenty\u201d, the environment secretary told LBC that he believed he would be better equipped than any of the other candidates to take Jeremy Corbyn \u201cto the cleaners\u201d with a \u201cforensic\u201d examination of his policies. Rory Stewart was eliminated in the third round of voting on Wednesday as Johnson substantially increased his tally of supporters to 143, compared with Hunt on 54 and Gove on 51. Javid, who leapfrogged Stewart to stay in the race, is expected to be knocked out in the first round of voting on Thursday. The contest between Gove and Hunt to make the ballot paper for Conservative members will depend on their ability to win support from MPs who backed eliminated candidates."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
