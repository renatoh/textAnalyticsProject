For many women such reports incite instant anger (Letters, September 19). Living in London I can only speak of my peers in the capital city who all agree that such delay in procreating is not for the pursuit of a fulfilling career, but rather because we have no choice. We would much prefer not to be slaving away at our desk for 10 hours a day, and gaze at new mothers with green eyes. We do not blame everything on the men of our society, but to some degree they must be held responsible. Many thirtysomething women dream of finding a man and having babies. It is the men who prevent the dream from becoming a reality. However, unless we artificially inseminate ourselves, embark upon a life of single parenthood and financial strain, we have little choice but to maintain our careers. Men no longer have the urge to settle down and carry the responsibility of childhood. And why should they? Why settle for a thirtysomething woman with all the emotional responsibility that brings, not to mention financial strain should they start a family, when there is an ever increasing number of younger women too willing to fulfil their sexual needs, and demand little, if anything, in return. Men no longer need to walk a woman down the aisle to sleep with her. They no longer need a woman to look after their homes, all having mastered the art of washing and ironing their own shirts. Men can and often do hold off having children well into their 40s and then with a women half their age. However, we women are not so lucky. As much as we like to believe it is all a state of mind, unless we are a supermodel or an actress with the resources to fund a personal trainer, plastic surgery and 10 hours' sleep a night, we are not attractive to many men. Women who find themselves in their late 20s and early 30s are at a disadvantage. We have an ever-increasing number of women to compete against. The British Medical Journal is preaching to the converted. Maybe it would care to research why late twenty- and early thirtysomething women can't get a man to stay with us. Fiona Hill-Samuel London I write on behalf of all of us childless women who are \"defying nature and risking heartbreak\". The fact is many of us have had no choice but to settle for a career instead of motherhood (or both). We cannot be conveniently labelled as women who \"want it all\". There are far too many men out there who come into the equation. Can we try to resist the temptation to single out women when pointing to the problems with delaying pregnancy? Unfortunately, far too many women \"risked heartbreak\" by keeping their fingers crossed, only to find they were waiting for nothing.
