The company is Thomas Cook. Obituaries were being prepared 18 months ago as a debt crisis threatened to become overwhelming, but these days the package holiday firm is everybody's favourite recovery stock. It has travelled from 16p to 164p in less than a year under new chief executive Harriet Green, who has surprised herself with the savings she has found. She announced another \u00a340m yesterday, meaning her target for \"cost out\" and profit improvement by the end of 2015 has increased from \u00a3350m to \u00a3390m. Outsiders suspected unlamented former boss Manny Fontenla-Novoa had assembled a disjointed and inefficient travel empire. Few knew a hard-headed newcomer could cut so much cost so quickly. The other reason for the shares' popularity yesterday is the fund-raising itself. There's a \u20ac525m bond issue alongside the \u00a3120m placing and \u00a3305m rights issue. That collection will remove the lingering risk that the tower of debt (\u00a31.2bn at the end of March) could undo Green's operational handiwork. Suddenly, the capital structure looks vaguely normal again and there's a new \u00a3691m borrowing facility to ride the inevitable cash swings in this seasonal industry. Big long-term challenges remain. The force is still with easyJet, expedia, Ryanair and DIY holidays. Strikes by air traffic controllers will occur and aviation fuel prices will bounce around. But a properly managed Thomas Cook should still be able to prosper in this world. The package holiday is not dead and gross margins in the UK \u2013 the most troublesome division \u2013 are 23%. Group turnover is \u00a39bn. If costs and debt are under control, the business works."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
