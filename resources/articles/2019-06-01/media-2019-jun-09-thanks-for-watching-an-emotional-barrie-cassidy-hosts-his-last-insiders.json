It wasn\u2019t even about the players who he had alternatively terrified and charmed for almost two decades from a Melbourne studio on Sunday mornings, while in the real world eggs cooked and coffee was brewed. It was about those who had always been at the heart of what he did and why. And it was those people who caused Cassidy\u2019s famously craggy face to soften in an emotional tide. The audience. \u201cThe night after Bob Hawke died I went to the John Curtin hotel in Melbourne \u2013 you were there, Mike [Bowers] \u2013 for old time\u2019s sake and I ran into a young bloke who said to me, \u2018a few years ago I went on Tinder\u2019. And I thought, oh, where is this going. \u201cHe said that he found a post from a young woman who said that she wanted to meet somebody who watched Insiders, preferably with a hangover. He got in touch, they watched Insiders and now they\u2019re married. \u201cHow good is Insiders! \u201cI say that for this point of view that I\u2019ll be thanking all of those around me later on, but it\u2019s the audience. \u201cIt\u2019s you that I want to just talk to you very briefly this morning. I\u2019ve been over the years pulled up in the street so many times. So many emails from people who essentially make the same point that they change their routine, they change the way that they manage their Sunday mornings around Insiders. \u201cI just loved hearing that along the journey. \u201cSo, my final message is that I am moving on. But next week, and into the future, it will be the same team, it will be the same coach, just a different captain. \u201cSo stay loyal because the people around me deserve that. They really do \u2026 and for the final time, thanks for watching.\u201d The man whose straight-forward interviewing style had trapped Australia\u2019s best and brightest political minds \u2013 and many of those in between \u2013 into corners they had no idea they were sauntering into for the best part of two decades, often setting the political agenda for the week, was humbled by those he\u2019d sacrificed all those Sundays for. Guardian Australia photographer-at-large and Insiders co-creator, Mike Bowers, who ambushed his friend and colleague on the couch for a surprise Talking Pictures segment paying tribute to Cassidy, said at the end of the day everything Cassidy had built was for those who watched. \u201cIt was very emotional but, as is Barrie\u2019s attitude, he wanted to fit in as much as possible in day-to-day politics, which is what Barrie is like. He is always the most excited person in the room over any story, political or otherwise. There\u2019s a lesson for young journalists there \u2013 no matter how big you get, never lose your excitement for a story,\u201d Bowers said. The genesis of what would become Insiders was hatched in a Brussels bar in early 2001, where the name translated to \u201csudden death\u201d, by Bowers, Cassidy, Heather Ewart and Gaven Morris, who came up with the \u201cInsiders casual\u201d dress code \u2013 jacket but no tie. The idea was always for a Sunday morning political show, which not only held those in power to account, but helped explain the inner workings of Australia\u2019s parliament to those who made the ultimate decisions on who should lead \u2013 voters. \u201cHe got very emotional at the end, but it was always about the viewers and the people around him,\u201d Bowers said. \u201cThat never changed.\u201d Cassidy watched as Australia\u2019s best political journalists paid tribute to a man they considered a first among equals, a friend and mentor, alongside politicians, past and present, including the former prime minister John Howard and the late Bob Hawke. \u201cBarrie Cassidy is a cliff that speaks,\u201d David Marr said. \u201cThe cliff opens, out comes a brutally simple question, and the cliff just goes back into shape again, while his victim has to find an answer.\u201d The Sky News political editor, David Speers, has been confirmed as the new, permanent host of Insiders, but he won\u2019t be taking up the role until early next year, when his current contract runs its course. In the meantime, for a period Cassidy declared be known as \u2018waiting for David\u2019, a series of ABC hosts will fill the chair."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
