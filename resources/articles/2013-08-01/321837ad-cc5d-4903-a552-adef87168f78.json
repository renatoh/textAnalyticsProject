One scene takes Kate (Sandra Bullock) on a walking tour, past stunning examples of local architecture. Christopher Plummer, who plays Alex's (Keanu Reeves) architect father, has one of my favourite lines. He says the most important quality in architecture is \"always the light. Always.\" Take an architecture tour for your own light-filled experience. \u2022 Also filmed in the area: Sixteen Candles, The Untouchables, Source Code, Couples Retreat, The Break-Up Seattle The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989) The scenes in this movie that were filmed in Belltown, Pioneer Square and the Roosevelt Hotel all pull you into this great Pacific Northwest city. Seattle is a walking city and the Underground city tour takes you through subterranean passages that used to be the city's main streets \u2013 where you can see the storefronts and learn the origin of the term \"skid row\". From the current street level, you can see Mount Rainier, the Space Needle and Elliott Bay. Pike Place Market has the original Starbucks, but you'll never run out of places for great coffee. \u2022 Also filmed in the area: Sleepless In Seattle, An Officer and a Gentleman, 10 Things I Hate About You Asheville, North Carolina Being There (1979) I've seen more US attractions than I can count, yet the Biltmore Estate remains my favourite. Built between 1889 and 1895, America's largest privately owned residence is used extensively as a location in Being There, starring Peter Sellers. At 175,000 sq ft, with 250 rooms, it's insanely opulent. This is a house you'll talk about for the rest of your life \u2013 it's that magnificent. The audio tour makes this spectacular chateau come alive. Or try a behind the scenes visit: ourstate.com/biltmore-insiders-tour. \u2022 Also filmed in the area: The Hunger Games, The Last of the Mohicans, Patch Adams, Richie Rich Detroit Transformers (2007) It's sad to see a crumbling city, but Detroit's ghostly existence is the reason it's one of my favourites: it is littered with pre-depression-era buildings in varying states of disrepair. Michigan Central Station is a spectacular display not just of Beaux-Arts architecture, but also of the city's ruin, and Transformers offers a glimpse of the once-amazing interior. There's still hope that the birthplace of Motown will revive, but it lives on in photographs and memories (motownmuseum.org). \u2022 Also filmed in the area: Dreamgirls, 8 Mile, Beverly Hills Cop, Four Brothers Philadelphia Rocky (1976) Who can forget Rocky Balboa running through Philadelphia, children cheering, the Gonna Fly Now theme pulsing? The run ends with Rocky boxing air at the top of the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. People come from all over the world in order to run up those steps. Visit Independence Hall, where the Declaration of Independence and the US constitution were signed and where Rocky jumped a park bench, stroll through the Italian Market in South Philly (seen in multiple Rocky movies), and have a Cheesesteak at Pat's King of Steaks where Rocky ate in the first movie. \u2022 Also filmed in the area: Silver Linings Playbook, The Sixth Sense, National Treasure, Philadelphia South Dakota Dances with Wolves (1990) Mount Rushmore is not a place you see \"along the way\". You have to plan to visit. That was the idea of carving people into mountains. South Dakota now gets more than three million visitors a year. Mount Rushmore will give you a rush, and the other stuff will recall the movie \u2013 herds of bison, sweeping grasslands, buttes and spires. \u2022 Also filmed in the area: North by Northwest, Armageddon, National Treasure: Book of Secrets Marfa, Texas No Country for Old Men (2007) Marfa has in recent years become an artists' enclave and the home of \"that fake Prada store\" (It's an art installation). Highway 90 from Sanderson across lonely west Texas takes you through towns with poetic names such as Emerson and Longfellow. Tiny artistic Marfa, in its bleak surroundings, has been a movie location for over half a century. And while there's not a lot to show for that, you will be immersed in the overwhelming desolation of the place, and find the landscape as scary as Javier Bardem's ruthless killer in No Country for Old Men. \u2022 Also filmed in the area: , There Will Be Blood, Fandango Lancaster County, Pennsylvania Witness (1985) Pennsylvania Amish country is all rolling pastures, horse-drawn buggies, men in black hats and biblical beards. Women, wearing simple dresses and starched caps, hanging laundry or planting flowers. In Lancaster, the oldest existing Amish settlement in America, the farms are immaculately kept and the air is clean. Souvenirs are practical \u2013 handmade quilts and wooden furniture. Visit the farm where the film was made, and see padutchcountry.com for more ideas. \u2022 Also filmed in the area: Beloved, Girl, Interrupted, Lucky Numbers Anchorage, Alaska Into the Wild (2007) If you have the chance to drive to Alaska, do it. You'll understand what going \"into the wild\" means. We travelled hundreds of miles without seeing any civilisation. Everywhere feels inherently unspoiled. Some say it's the last great place on earth. Adventurer Christopher McCandless, whose story the film tells, said, \"The freedom and simple beauty is too good to pass up.\" And in Anchorage, they have moose and a ballet company. More at alaska.org and anchorage.net. \u2022 Also filmed in the area: Big Miracle, The Frozen Ground Livingston, Montana A River Runs Through It (1992) Life lessons on the end of a fly-fishing rod? Whatever works. The scenery in this movie is breathtaking because Montana is breathtaking. Interstate 90 actually has a river that runs through it and beside it. It babbles and sparkles, and is so clear you can see to the bottom. I've often seen fly-fisherman in hip waders, casting their lines. The town is pretty hip too \u2013 Gil's (gilsgoods.com) offers wood-fired pizza, and Dan Bailey's shop has been tying flies for over 70 years.
