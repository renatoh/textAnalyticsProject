Rights groups have condemned the move as threat to civilians\u2019 safety. The shutdown came with no warning on 21 June, one day after Myanmar\u2019s ministry of transport and communications ordered four companies to temporarily suspend mobile internet services to nine townships in northern Rakhine state and southern Chin state. The military has been clashing throughout the year in the region with Arakan Army (AA) insurgents, who want political autonomy for Rakhine Buddhists. The clashes have displaced 30,000 civilians in the last six months, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The area also saw the systematic expulsion of 730,000 Rohingya Muslims starting in 2017, which UN investigators say the military perpetrated with genocidal intent. The AA are a more formidable force than the fighters claiming to represent the Rohingya and have inflicted historically higher death tolls on the military. The ministry\u2019s directive allows it to suspend telecommunications services \u201cwhen an emergency situation arises\u201d. Soe Thein, ministry\u2019s permanent secretary, told local media on Monday that \u201cinternet service will resume when the peace and stability are restored to the region\u201d. Only one of the four telecommunications operators has publicly acknowledged the internet blackout. Telenor said in a statement on Friday that it \u201chas been asking [the ministry] for further clarification on the rationale for the shutdown and emphasised that freedom of expression through access to telecoms services should be maintained for humanitarian purposes, especially during times of conflict.\u201d The statement pointed out that voice and SMS services have not been affected by the shutdown. But rights groups have criticised the shutdown as threat to civilians who are trapped in the conflict zone, which has long been closed-off to journalists and foreign humanitarian organisations. \u201cCivilians living in conflict need to access information, and this information can often be lifesaving. People trapped in Rakhine state won\u2019t be able to access information, express themselves or reach their loved ones,\u201d said Berhan Taye, a campaigner for the digital rights group Access Now. \u201cThis shutdown is expected to disrupt humanitarian efforts directed toward this conflict. Moreover, because of these shutdowns, it would be difficult to expose the real effect of the conflict on civilians and the actions of the warring parties,\u201d she told the Guardian. Yanghee Lee, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, said the blackout had already led to rights violations. \u201cI am told that the Tatmadaw is now conducting a \u2018clearance operation\u2019, which we all know by now can be a cover for committing gross human rights violations against the civilian population.\u201d Zaw Zaw Htun, secretary of the Rakhine Ethnic Congress, which documents civilian casualties and provides humanitarian relief services, said it was now impossible to collect or verify news. \u201cThe [civilian] government is supporting the actions of the military. Since they are a democratic government, they should think about the rights of the people,\u201d Zaw Zaw Htun said. On Monday, 21 Myanmar-based civil and digital rights organisations released a statement demanding an end to the shutdown and a revision of the Telecommunications Law in compliance with UN Security Council resolutions \u201cidentifying uninterrupted internet access as a fundamental enabler for the enjoyment of human rights\u201d. To some observers, the internet blackout portends a spike in the scale of the bloodshed in Myanmar\u2019s war against the AA, in which recent military atrocities include the killing of six Rakhine state villagers in captivity. \u201cThis is just like the Saffron Revolution in 2007,\u201d said Myanmar Press Council member Zayar Hlaing, referring to democratic uprisings that were brutally crushed by the previously ruling military junta. \u201cThey shut down connections and killed the monks as foreign reporters were struggling to get information out of the country.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
