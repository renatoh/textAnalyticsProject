A bit later, when we moved out of that shoebox, they started fostering, so there was a revolving door of children with varying degrees of trauma and need. As a child I found it difficult, but as an adult I think it really helped me be empathetic and optimistic about the power of love and stability. I used to be young and idealistic and believed I could change the world. Now I concentrate my efforts on one part of the world I might be able to change. I laser-focus on one person or one issue, and try to make a dent in it. My partner works in news and I end up getting saturated by it, so I bought a pair of ear defenders to walk around the house in because the news makes me so furious and depressed. I\u2019ve had success, but I\u2019m still haunted by the fear of being hungry. Once you\u2019ve lived it it never leaves you. I hoard food \u2013 I never throw anything away, I insist on taking leftovers home from restaurants, and that\u2019s because it wasn\u2019t a choice, it was a set of terrible circumstances. I\u2019m a big gay butch dyke on the internet who\u2019s sometimes vegan and has a little quibble about their gender every now and again, so I\u2019ve heard every insult by now. People nag me about my weight, my cooking, my tattoos, my hair, my sexuality, everything. I can deal with all that because I\u2019m still doing my job and I kind of like myself. But when people start saying things about my family and friends, who never asked to be in the public eye, I lose my temper. I go full lioness. I went to Baptist church as a kid, and became a Sunday school teacher. I was kicked out of my church for being gay and I lost my faith. Now, I believe that there\u2019s something, but I haven\u2019t done too much assessment on what it is. I\u2019ve had to learn to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I haven\u2019t budgeted for any more unpaid work this month,\u201d which is a nice way of saying, \u201cFuck you, pay me!\u201d I don\u2019t mind doing things for free for charity, but when it\u2019s a conference at which people are paying a grand to attend and they can\u2019t afford to pay their speakers, I do think: \u201cYou might want to look at your bottom line, mate.\u201d Party politics are quite upsetting. I\u2019ve been a member of the Labour party, the Green party, the Women\u2019s Equality Party, the National Health Action Party and now I\u2019m not a member of any. I like Ed Miliband, but there was one time at Labour Party Conference when I asked the question: \u201cWhat are you going to do about the rise of food banks?\u201d This was 2013, so food-bank use was probably half what it is now. He responded: \u201cWell when we get in power\u2026\u201d and I just exploded because I thought: \u201cPeople are hungry now. There are things you can do now.\u201d Tin Can Cook by Jack Monroe is out now.
