Six points down at half-time to a Scotland side heading their best Six Nations for seven seasons, France suddenly found the inspiration they had displayed in the first half at Twickenham and in the second at Dublin. First, centre Wesley Fofana scooted up the right \u2013 much as he had done up the left at Twickenham \u2013 brushing off poor tackles and then Maxime M\u00e9dard made the best of some more weak defending to go in under the posts. The human bowling ball Maxime Bastareaud had a hand in both, but it was the much-maligned Frederic Michalak who inspired the French turnaround, with three penalties in 13 minutes at the start of the second half. On a dire night in north Paris, the Scots managed to do the simple things better for 40 minutes before Michalak, at the centre of things, finally put an end to a run of seven championship games without a victory. Whatever happened on Saturday night, Scotland had already secured their best finish in the competition since 2006. All the pressure was on the championship's hot favourites two months ago, who needed to win by 16 points to avoid a first wooden spoon since 1969. They were denied any chance of that when Tim Visser, on the end a break by Matt Scott, reduced the lead with five minutes to go. Philippe Saint-Andre now has the task of justifying himself to Pierre Camou, his boss and president of the French federation. So far Camou has been an ally and there is little reason to expect any change in that stance, but Saint-Andre has been stung by some of the recent criticism, particularly that of a former national coach and the man who replaced him at Toulon, Bernard Laport. Scott Johnson simply has to decided whether he wants to continue as a Test coach. After taking over from Andy Robinson in November, after the humbling defeat by Tonga, the Australian had achieved close to totemic status north of the border, even before Paris. Wins against a much-fancied Italian side, which had just beaten France, and a generous Irish team that could not convert ridiculous amounts of possession into points, had guaranteed Scotland their best Six Nations in seven seasons. When Johnson sits down with Mark Dodson, the SRU's chief executive, he is unlikely to encounter a demanding boss. Of more interest is likely to be the coaching team with whom Johnson surrounds himself, if he stays. Dean Ryan, the forwards coach will be back at Sky this week, but what of Stevie Scott the interim skills coach? Along with defence coach Matt Taylor, the four have added to the depth of Test talent and on Saturday gave the 22-year-old Edinburgh lock Grant Gilchrist his debut. Saint-Andre, anticipating the rain, added weight \u2013 flanker Antonie Claassen, lock Sebastien Vahaamahina, centre Bastareaud \u2013 but then made a gesture to a more adventurous future, putting 18-year-old Gael Fickou on the bench when Florian Fritz's foot failed to heal. And rain it did, lashing down on kick-off and bringing French errors. Greig Laidlaw opened the scoring with three points in the eighth minute and added another three six minutes later. When France also lost a couple of lineouts and launched a couple of pointless kicks, there were the first groans from the capacity crowd. However, throughout the bad times France have continued to have faith in their scrum and initially it seemed their weapon of choice, creating momentum if not points. Four scrums in five minutes managed only to churn large sections of Stade de France turf and when Vincent Clerc dropped a high ball, France were on their heals again. And that was the tale of a scrappy first half until Stuart Hogg lit up the final minutes with a series of breaks before Max Evans, on for Sean Maitland came close to recovering his own kick and chase."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
