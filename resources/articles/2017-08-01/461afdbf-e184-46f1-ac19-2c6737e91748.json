The Brazilian, signed from Barcelona for a world-record \u00a3198m, slotted home after 82 minutes, converting Edinson Cavani\u2019s low ball across the box. Cavani earlier doubled PSG\u2019s lead after Jordan Ikoko\u2019s comical own goal, guiding his pass beyond the Guingamp goalkeeper Karl-Johan Johnsson. Starting on the left of a front three also featuring Cavani and Angel Di Maria, but given considerable licence to roam, the 25-year-old Neymar produced plenty of impressive moments in what will surely go down as a memorable start to his PSG career. PSG are second in the league on six points, behind Lyon on goals scored with Monaco, who thrashed Dijon 4-1 away earlier on Sunday, in third place also on six points. Despite Monaco fans\u2019 concerns that the French prodigy Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 might be leaving, they know they can still trust Radamel Falcao after the Colombian striker hit a hat-trick. The France international Mbapp\u00e9 was left on the bench amid speculation that he wants to join PSG but he was not needed as Monaco equalled the record of 14 consecutive wins in the French league. Falcao scored twice before the break and once afterwards to take his tally to four goals in two games while Jemerson netted another. Earlier Lille were beaten 3-0 at promoted RC Strasbourg, conceding all three goals after the striker Nicolas de Pr\u00e9ville took over as goalkeeper following the sending off of Mike Maignan in the 63rd minute."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
