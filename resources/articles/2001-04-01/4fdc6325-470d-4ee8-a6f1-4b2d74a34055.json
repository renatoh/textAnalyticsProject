That is, if you can handle humid tropical heat and mosquitoes - but at least there's no malaria or any other serious tropical diseases there. The Seychelles are truly paradise: I lived and worked there for three years and sometimes could die with homesickness. They have the best beaches in the world (I've seen plenty around the globe), very relaxed attitudes everywhere, and no club holidays, beach beggars or heavy disco scene. Gorgeous nature, great food (go to Takamaka Beach and have your fish freshly caught and grilled while you dive in the waves), excellent, cheap and entertaining bus service all over the main island. Hotels are expensive but guest houses can be reasonably cheap and are clean. I could go on and on... The best Seychelles beach is Anse Lazio on Praslin. Enjoy it! Sabine \u0095 June is towards the rainy season on the west coast of India. It will also be very hot - you'll fry on the beach! I'd think carefully before parting with my money, if I were you.
