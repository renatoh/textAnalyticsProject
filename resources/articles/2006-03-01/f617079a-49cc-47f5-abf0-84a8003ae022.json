The Office for National Statistics (ONS) today said its monthly output price index - sometimes known as \"factory gate inflation\" - was up 0.3% between January and February in the second monthly rise in a row. That increase kept the annual rate at 2.9%, compared with the 2.8% expected by analysts. The official figures came as firms continued to battle rising energy prices and other costs. Manufacturers have been absorbing these increases for the past few months but are beginning to pass them down the supply chain to customers. Costs for manufacturing firms dipped only slightly, but the reduction was the first in five months and more of a fall than analysts expected. The ONS input price index, which charts the prices of materials and fuels purchased for processing, rose 15% in the year to February compared with 15.8% in the 12 months to the end of January. Core output prices, excluding food, beverages, tobacco and petrol, rose by 0.2% as expected, nudging the annual rate up 0.1% to 1.8% compared with the 12 months to the end of January. Unexpectedly low prices for oil and gas included a 2.7% drop in the cost of crude oil between January and February. The mixed producer price data underscored that Britain's manufacturers were still being squeezed. On the other hand, however, costs did fall for the first time in five months and customers were willing to pay more - a trend manufacturers hope will continue. \"So far, the degree of pass through from higher input to output price inflation has been limited,\" HSBC economist John Butler said. \"But today's data, alongside recent survey evidence, suggest manufacturers are now seeking to restore margins. \"However, in our view competition remains a major hurdle to inflation developing along the supply chain.\" On Wednesday the ONS issues its much-awaited monthly unemployment data, and on Thursday, retail sales figures - two crucial elements in the monthly snapshot of the state of the UK economy as the chancellor, Gordon Brown, prepares to present next week what may be his last budget."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
