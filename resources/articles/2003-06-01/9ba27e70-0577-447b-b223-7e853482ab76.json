He had given the Spaniards' kit-man his shirt and now he wanted one back, maybe Raul's, maybe Zinedine Zidane's, even Ronaldo's if it was still up for grabs. But when the door opened the kit-man was shaking his head apologetically. In broken English it was explained that, sorry, nobody wanted to exchange. A shirt was pressed into his hand. \"Here's yours back.\" As knock-backs go, Neville has had worse. He has been abused in the street, spat at and held open to the worst sort of public ridicule. Even worse, he has been persecuted in the village where he lives with his wife Julie and their young son Harvey. After Euro 2000, when his foul on Viorel Moldovan earned Romania the penalty that eliminated England, his house became a rendezvous for local troublemakers. One night they set fire to a flag of St George and draped it over the gateposts of his house. Even the hymn of praise that is sung in his honour at Old Trafford is part affectionate, part patronising: \"Phil, Phil will tear you apart, again,\" to the tune of Joy Division's Love Will Tear Us Apart. The same song was first reworked in Ryan Giggs's honour, and there is a deliberate irony in that Neville is the Manchester United player least likely to emulate one of Giggs's trademark runs or, for that matter, tear any defence apart. At least the humour is meant in good spirit. At Old Trafford they appreciate perspiration as much as inspiration. On Sir Alex Ferguson's office wall there is a Govan coat of arms with the words Nihil sine labore and it could be Neville's motto: nothing without work. With England, it is not always enough. His parents, Neville and Jill, had to stop going to matches because of the vitriol directed towards their youngest son. Even in the general bonhomie that accompanied last week's defeat of Serbia-Montenegro in Leicester, the announcement of his name enticed mocking jeers. \"The fans are obviously still aggrieved about what happened against Romania,\" says Neville. \"But it's nothing new. Ever since I started playing for England there have always been a few boos when my name was read out. The important thing, for me, is that when I left the field last Tuesday it was to applause.\" It was the culmination, he hopes, of a subtle but definitive change of mentality. \"A couple of years ago it was very anti-Manchester United with England. In the final few games at Wembley that was definitely the case but since we've started going around the grounds the attitude has changed. It's been so refreshing going to places like Leicester and Southampton where the atmosphere has been incredible. \"There's been none of the anti-United stuff and people's minds have probably changed towards me, too. A lot of negative stuff was written about me after that Romania game. Since then I've been out of the squad, forgotten about and now it feels like a new start. There's not so much negativity flying around and it's nice to be looked upon positively. People say it's not important, but it is. If you know the fans are on your side rather than against you it makes a hell of a difference.\" Nevertheless, Neville has grown wearily accustomed to disappointment lurking round the corner. Even if he now has 39 caps, his international career will always be loaded with regret: Glenn Hoddle dumping him on the eve of France 98, Sven-Goran Eriksson doing likewise before last summer's tournament. He exists in a world of uncertainty at Old Trafford. \"If Roy Keane, Paul Scholes and Seba Veron are fit, they play. And when you look at the players everyone is speculating we might buy you can find yourself thinking: 'dear me, where's my next game coming from?'\" Nor is he presumptuous enough to assume that his transition from right-back, left-back and Ferguson's odd-job man to a holding midfielder of some distinction guarantees him a place in Eriksson's team for Wednesday's Euro 2004 qualifier against Slovakia. Eriksson's toughest dilemma is not, as widely touted, whether Wayne Rooney should supplant Emile Heskey, a relatively simple choice considering Michael Owen made it clear in his Sunday newspaper column he rates Everton's 17-year-old higher than his own Liverpool club-mate. Instead, the biggest quandary for Eriksson is who to play in the defensive role in his midfield diamond. Owen Hargreaves had been pencilled in originally but, equally, Neville is entitled to feel aggrieved if he is overlooked now. \"If you asked me six months ago whether I could imagine myself playing midfield for England, I'd have said no chance. But I've worked hard. Determination is the word I'd use. I've had a bit of luck with injuries and I've really enjoyed switching to midfield. \"I don't realise how much I like this role until I go back to playing full-back. Without being disrespectful, it's boring at full-back. Well, not boring. But there's not as much activity. You need someone to play the anchor role and it suits me down to the ground.\" And on Wednesday there might even be a Slovakia player or two wanting his shirt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
