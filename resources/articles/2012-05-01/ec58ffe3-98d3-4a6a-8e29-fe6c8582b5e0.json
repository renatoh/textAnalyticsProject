If anything, for the first time in Premier League history, they may have slightly undersold the massive event. Like most football lovers I had been looking forward to the massiveness all week but the pre-match realism of panellists Graeme Souness and Gary Neville was such a dampener I almost switched over to the rugby. The more the presenter Ed Chamberlain talked about nerves and slip-ups and drama, the more Souness especially advertised the new resolute City. \"Manchester City are in a great position,\" he said. \"They've got the bit between their teeth. There's a real resilience, a real desire. This City team isn't going to slip up.\" Neville agreed and the ad break arrived \u2013 just in time, I expect, for someone from Sky to explain to the panel the need to keep an audience for four hours. Well, yah boo to Souness and Neville, who incidentally were so far ahead as pundits of the season there was no danger of them being overhauled on the final day. The narrative was way more interesting than they predicted and even the most enthusiastic proponents of massive Sunday might have expected. The cameras did not know where to look. Paddy Kenny's mercurial game was the story for a while, then the latest demonstration from Joey Barton that he really is due a refund on those anger management sessions took centre stage before the story increasingly looked like one of disappointment for Manchester City. We got shots of Roberto Mancini looking a beaten man in his technical area and even the obligatory close-up of a supporter in tears, as early as the 66th minute, an example of premature lamentation that could really use some treatment. And then came the incredible ending that topped everything before, and who better to reflect City joy than co-commentator Niall Quinn, seemingly on a free transfer from the Fanzone? \"I'm lost for words,\" he said, which is not exactly what you are looking for in a co-commentator but les mots justes \u2013 or les non-mots justes \u2013 nonetheless. Sergio Ag\u00fcero and all the players in Sunday'sdrama should cherish the memories because there will come a time when that is all their sporting careers amount to. Coping with that can, as we know, be a problem. But worry not, retired sportsmen, help is at hand from the retired England cricket captain Michael Vaughan. In a BBC1 documentary, Sporting Heroes: After The Final Whistle, Vaughan visited former sports stars, and sports psychologists, to talk about building a life once the applause, the adulation and the massive days are over. One way, Vaughan revealed, is to get a job, er, presenting documentaries on the BBC. \"It's brilliant,\" said Vaughanie to Hoggy (Matthew Hoggard), one of his interviewees. \"Any good looking cricketer with a nice voice \u2013 Yorkshire is good because people think you're talking common sense \u2013 is going to get snapped up by the Beeb. You'll have to go on Saturday Kitchen and maybe one of those dancing shows or summat but at the end of it you're a broadcaster. Really. And you don't even have to be any good. You don't believe me? Two words: Darren Gough. Oh, and don't forget the inspirational speaking business, and the corporates at twenty grand a time.\" This was the show playing in my head anyway. I could not get to grips with the real one because Vaughan was wearing ripped jeans, clearly designer ripped, but ripped nonetheless. I don't know why they irritated me so much but they did. I would have had more respect for a man with a million pound house in Barbados \u2013 albeit in a golf resort (in conjunction, two of the most depressing words in the English language) \u2013 if he wore a white suit and a pith helmet. He spoke to John McEnroe who, of course, has really hit the skids since retirement, apart from the seniors tour, the commentating, the art dealing and the two lovely mansions, and to George Foreman, who you may be interested to know if you are one of the 12 people left in Britain without a George Foreman grill in the cupboard under the sink, is now quite big in the kitchen appliance business. The inspirational story of Matt Hampson, the promising rugby union player left paralysed from the neck down after a scrum collapse, was not really about retirement at all and belonged in a different programme \u2013 one about him maybe rather than a presenter the BBC is keen to promote. I was, however, immensely cheered to learn that the brilliant Sheffield boxer Herol \"Bomber\" Graham is rebuilding his life after attempting suicide in the wake of his retirement In the early '80s I interviewed Herol once or twice and found him an engaging guest. I was in Sheffield at the time starting what I laughingly call a career in broadcasting, when clearly I should have been concentrating on my cricket."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
