Gareth McAuley and Chris Brunt both scored their first goals at this level and Grant McCann was also on target as Northern Ireland moved into joint second place in Group Three. But the victory came at a price, with key trio Kyle Lafferty, Steven Davis and George McCartney all booked and ruled out of the crucial home fixture against Poland next month. That is a problem for another night, though, and Worthington was keen to take the positives. \"It was a good professional performance, good attitude and focus on the game,\" he said. \"We passed the ball well at times, scored three good goals and kept a clean sheet \u2013 they're the positives. \"We've lost three but let's enjoy the three points, which puts us into second place. Now we can look forward to a hard game, but a great game, against Poland. We have played a game more but we are back in the mix. \" Northern Ireland took the lead in the seventh minute when McAuley struck a superb half volley into the net following a corner from Grant McCann. Stephen Craigan should have added a second in the 13th minute when he got clear of his marker, but he scuffed his shot wide. His team did not have long to wait before extending their lead, however. It was another fine strike as well, with McCann firing a shot into the corner from 18 yards after Martin Paterson's effort was blocked just after the half hour. Worthington made his first change in the 55th minute, bringing on Brunt for Lafferty. Brunt quickly made an impact, scoring his team's third goal eight minutes later, driving in a 25-yard free-kick that went under the goalkeeper's body. San Marino were reduced to 10 men in the 70th minute when Manuel Marani was sent off after picking up a second yellow card. Northern Ireland continued to pour forward in a bid to add to their goal tally, but the home side held firm. PA"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
