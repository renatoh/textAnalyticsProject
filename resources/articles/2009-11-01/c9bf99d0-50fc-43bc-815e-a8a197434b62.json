Squeezed between Black Eyed Peas' autotuned pop and Calvin Harris's squelchy electro, it sits rather awkwardly \u2013 a 28-year-old song, performed by a singer with an odd, trebly voice, and a penchant for snakeskin T-shirts. Nevertheless, Journey's Don't Stop Believin' is the 17th best-selling track in the country this week so far \u2013 a song that has gained new life in its middle-age. This isn't because of Journey's sterling work. The American FM rock bandband \u2013put together in 1973 by former members of Santana \u2013 have spent recent years gigging quietly around the world since their US chart pomp more than a quarter of a century ago. Don't Stop Believin's is in this week's charts because of its appearance on last weekend's X Factor. This week, baby-faced beauty Joe McElderry sang the song for the show's Rock Week, and in doing so spoke directly to \"smalltown girls\" living in \"lonely worlds\", many of whom picked up their mobiles and kept him in the contest. This gave Steve Perry's classic American narrative about finding hope in the streetlights a new, oestrogen-fuelled twist; it also inspired 7,000 viewers to find the original online, and click \"buy\". Still, that isn't the whole story of the song's success. Don't Stop Believin' reentered the public consciousness in 2007, when it was used to soundtrack the final scene of the final episode of The Sopranos, a scene parodied over and over again on American TV and on the web. In 2008, it became the most downloaded 20th century track on the iTunes Music Store. My teenage brother tells me that many a metropolitan nightclub plays it for the last song of the night \u2013 without discernible irony \u2013 and that he and his friends adore it, without measure. Two things explain the peculiar contemporary appeal of this song. Firstly, there's an obvious, factual explanation \u2013 its presence across mass-market TV shows, which join people together, whatever their age. Songs gaining second lives on the small screen isn't a new thing, admittedly \u2013 the first strains of I Heard It On The Grapevine, for instance, still take me back to the moment where I realised I fancied boys, watching Nick Kamen remove his jeans by a washing machine \u2013 but in 2009, the internet intensifies this experience. Anyone can remind themselves of special moments soundtracked by particular songs with a few clicks of the mouse, play them repeatedly, and share them with friends. To a generation that has little memory of a world before the web, these are the watercooler moments that people raised in the days of limited TV choice recall wistfully. Second, it's OK to like power ballads these days: they are no longer the dirty secret of TV-advertised drivetime rock compilations. Earlier this decade, songs by Journey, Foreigner and Boston were classed as guilty pleasures \u2013 celebrated with a wry wink, and danced to only archly. But as the consumption of music has changed in the last decade, this uneasy category has lost its appeal. Thank God it has, too. I thank the phenomenon of shuffling mp3 players, bouncing us between styles; the diminishing importance, and relevance, of genre boundaries; and the way in which music has become less about coolness, and much more about unbridled enjoyment. There is nothing strange about having a place in your heart for music that is improving and challenging, and another for huge, rousing sentiments that make you cry in taxi-cabs, long for a lover, or yearn to sing loudly, and proudly, with those you love most. And that's exactly what Don't Stop Believin' does, for the young and the old, and those who believe music reached its apotheosis with the concept of Adult Oriented Rock."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
