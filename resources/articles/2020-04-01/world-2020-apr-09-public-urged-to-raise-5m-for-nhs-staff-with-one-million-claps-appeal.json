For the last two weeks, people throughout the country have been leaning out of windows, standing in gardens and on balconies to join in a national round of applause for the key workers helping the country through the pandemic. Together with the third such show of appreciation on Thursday, NHS Charities Together is asking people to text \u201cclap\u201d to 70507, which will trigger a \u00a35 donation, along with a message of support. Organisers of the \u201cOne Million Claps\u201d appeal are asking for at least 1 million people to donate \u00a35 by text message to fund food deliveries, overnight stays, kits and travel costs. A short film has been produced to promote the campaign, voiced by the entertainer and writer David Walliams, which features a version of the Queen song We Will Rock You with its lyrics amended to \u201cNHS, we love you; We say, we say, thank you\u201d. \u201cLike everyone else, I\u2019ve been incredibly moved by the millions of us showing our public support for our health service over the last two Thursday evenings,\u201d said Ellie Orton, chief executive of NHS Charities Together, which sends donations to about 140 NHS charities in England, Scotland and Wales. \u201cI really hope One Million Claps inspires those who can to give a donation that will make a real difference to the amazing staff and volunteers who are daily saving lives and battling against this horribly virus on our behalf,\u201d she said. NHS Charities Together is running a national Covid-19 urgent appeal and, in recent days, the organisation has raised money from bookmakers who profited from last Saturday\u2019s \u201cvirtual Grand National\u201d. It was also announced on Wednesday evening that the 20 captains of Premier League football clubs had reached agreement on the formation of a charitable fund in partnership with NHS Charities Together that seeks donations totalling \u00a34m. In addition, Dame Vera Lynn and Katherine Jenkins have recorded a duet of We\u2019ll Meet Again, inspired by the Queen\u2019s address to the nation on Sunday that made reference to the song. Money raised by the single will go to the same organisation. \u2022 Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
