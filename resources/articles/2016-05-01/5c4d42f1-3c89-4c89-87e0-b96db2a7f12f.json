The BBC will be told to reveal the pay of presenters who earn more than the \u00a3450,000 a year paid to director general Tony Hall \u2013 a plan described as a \u201cpoachers\u2019 charter\u201d by media executives who say rivals could use the new rules to pick off the BBC\u2019s best-paid presenters. It is understood that David Cameron personally intervened to set the level for disclosure at \u00a3450,000 after the culture secretary, John Whittingdale, initially suggested \u00a3150,000. That figure would have included nearly all major news presenters including Fiona Bruce, Huw Edwards and John Humphrys. Currently, the BBC discloses only limited information about the pay of on-screen talent; in 2015 it said there were nine people who appeared on air who were paid more than \u00a3500,000. But it not clear how happy the best-paid names will be with the proposals. Some of the biggest names \u2013 including Evans, who is believed to be the BBC\u2019s highest paid star\u2013 may investigate whether then can invoke clauses in their contracts preventing pay disclosure. The three-year contract Evans negotiated with the BBC last year is thought to have netted him as much as \u00a32m a year for presenting Top Gear and his Radio 2 breakfast show. Other high earners at the BBC include: Match of the Day presenter Lineker (on a reported \u00a32m); Norton (just under \u00a32m); and Clare Balding (as much as \u00a32m). None of these figures have been confirmed by the BBC. The white paper, to be presented to parliament by Whittingdale, is expected to announce a radical overhaul of BBC governance by giving more power to media regulator Ofcom and setting up a BBC unitary board. But after the BBC warned about a possible loss of editorial independence, the white paper will say that \u201cthe BBC will be responsible for appointing at least half of the board members\u201d - giving it control. The government will give itself the power to appoint six members: the chair, vice-chair and four representatives of the nations and regions. The old BBC Trust will be abolished and regulation will largely pass to Ofcom, which already regulates commercial broadcasters. Three seats are automatically guaranteed for the BBC \u2013 the director general and two lieutenants \u2013 meaning that the corporation would have to have to appoint three further board members if it wanted to ensure there was a 50/50 split between government and non-government appointees. As the bruising negotiations in the run-up to the publication reached their climax, Whittingdale was forced to concede in parliament that he would \u201cdo nothing to undermine\u201d the independence of the BBC following a barrage of criticism from MPs. Maria Eagle, the shadow culture secretary, had accused him of trying to turn the corporation into a \u201cmouthpiece of the government of the day\u201d following a stream of leaks about what was being considered. Whittingdale said the white paper would do nothing to change the pre-budget funding deal reached with the government last year and indicated that the BBC would not be ordered where to schedule its most popular entertainment programmes, such as Strictly Come Dancing, to avoid competing with commercial rivals. Cameron and the chancellor, George Osborne, have become closely involved in the negotiations, and ministers are hoping to avoid widespread criticism of the government\u2019s plans for the BBC before the EU referendum. Increased diversity will be included in the BBC\u2019s public purposes for the first time after repeated attempts to increase the number of female, minority ethnic and disabled staff have failed to bring about change quickly enough. With the need to agree the BBC\u2019s royal charter having to be completed by the end of this year, the government has bowed to pressure from BBC supporters to agree an 11-year charter, thereby disconnecting the highly charged negotiations from the political cycle now that parliaments are fixed for five years. The government is understood to be keen to use the media regulator Ofcom to stop the BBC chasing ratings against commercial rivals. \u201cThe tone has got to change at the BBC,\u201d said a government source. \u201cThe white paper will say: \u2018Feel free to celebrate success of a ratings hit, but think a little more about it\u2019.\u201d Although Ofcom will be given power to police such highly sensitive matters as distinctiveness, it is expected to take a year for the change to bed in. Distinctiveness has long been a key issue for Whittingdale but the report will aim to steer a course between the two sides, describing hits such Strictly Come Dancing and The Great British Bake Off, for example, as distinctive. \u201cThe aim is for this to land somewhere in the middle,\u201d said a government insider. \u201cFundamentalists will say this is a terrible assault on the BBC. The right wing of the Tory party will say it doesn\u2019t go far enough.\u201d Other proposals to be outlined in the white paper include: A commitment to the details of last July\u2019s financial settlement under which the BBC agreed to shoulder the cost of free licence fees for the over-75s. The licence fee to be increased in line with inflation for five years after 2017. With the universal charge currently set at \u00a3145.50 a year, the certainty will be welcomed by the BBC. Clauses designed to strengthen the BBC\u2019s independence including special protection for the director general as the editor-in-chief. Allowing rival producers to pitch for licence fee funds for public service content such as children\u2019s TV. However, such \u201ctop-slicing\u201d will be limited to the underspend from previous deals and is said to amount to less than \u00a350m. Non-payment of the licence fee will remain an offence, although the white paper is expected to suggest a simplification of the system of collection"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
