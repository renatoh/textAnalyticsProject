The town of 5,000 people on the northern tip of New Zealand\u2019s North Island should be known as a holiday resort, but instead it has been dubbed the murder capital of New Zealand after four homicides and six suicides in a single year. \u201cIt is like the town has become haunted,\u201d says Nina Griffiths, 18, who lost two friends to suicide this year. \u201cPeople say you have to get out of Kaitaia, you have to get out of this shithole. There is a sense of hopelessness if you stay here ... we don\u2019t feel like our lives are valued enough to put effort in to save them, and make sure this never happens again.\u201d Kaitaia is the last major stop on state highway one in the far north; 300km from Auckland or a $150 plane ticket out. Half the town earn less than NZ$20,000 a year, and 60% are Maori, with unemployment at more than double the national average. While it is pretty, the town is also remote, poor and increasingly stigmatised as the place dreams go to die. \u201cWe are a community that feels doomed,\u201d said He Korowai trust chief executive Ricky Houghton in October, still reeling from the suicide of his nephew, and four other young men aged under 25. \u201cIf these deaths happened anywhere else in New Zealand it would be front-page news - a crisis. But because it\u2019s Kaitaia we\u2019re forgotten, no one cares what happens to us. People think there is no future for the people here.\u201d Senior leaders openly acknowledge that Kaitaia has a range of entrenched and long-standing social problems, including a lack of viable employment, isolation and strong gang and drug links. But they also say 2016\u2019s glut of deaths may finally prove a turning point for their \u201cforgotten\u201d town \u2013 that the deaths have spurred a formerly broken community to unite and stick up for itself in a way they haven\u2019t seen in decades. Earlier this year, Kaitaia fire chief Colin Kitchen considered quitting his job after attending two hangings and a stabbing homicide in a 24-hour-period. \u201cOur town has been knocked for sure, we\u2019re still in shock. When it happens once or twice, well sadly that is expected, but when it keeps happening you think \u2018what the hell is going on here?\u2019 I did feel at one point that I would have to walk away from it, that I\u2019d had enough,\u201d says Kitchen, who has been with the fire brigade for more than four decades. \u201cBut if we stepped away from it, who would look after our community, and what kind of message would that send, if the leaders desert? I think this year has been so bad it\u2019s been a wake-up call, and I am finally starting to see things turn around. The town is getting stronger and regrouping.\u201d By August six people killed by their own hand had passed through the Kaitaia morgue. With some of the strictest guidelines in the world for the media reporting on suicides, the slew of \u201csudden deaths\u201d fuelled Kaitaia\u2019s reputation as the murder capital of New Zealand, and rumours in town twisted and warped, with some hearing as many as 15 people had died. Griffiths was feeling sick to the guts. Traumatised by the futility of her friends\u2019 lives so bluntly ended, but also frustrated by the community\u2019s initial response \u2013 which she describes as muted and repressed, with people referring to the deaths as \u201cpassings\u201d instead of suicides and murders. Griffiths felt Kaitaia \u2013 and young people especially \u2013 had two options: implode, or change, fast. \u201cThis town is so small everyone was affected by the deaths, literally everyone,\u201d says Griffiths, who has received a NZ$10,000 AMP scholarship to set up a youth space in town, intended as a retreat for vulnerable kids. \u201cPeople are always asking me when we go away for sports events and stuff \u2013 \u2018oh so you\u2019re from the murder capital.\u2019 And that doesn\u2019t help us feel better about ourselves, or our town. It makes us feel really embarrassed of where we live and this past year there has not been a lot of pride around here.\u201d In July Griffiths contacted comedian and mental health advocate Mike King, begging him to travel north and facilitate a straight-up conversation about suicide in Kaitaia. Suicide professionals tried to dissuade her, as they had attempted to dissuade King when he visited in 2013, saying discussing the deaths in a public forum could inspire copycats or \u201cstir up emotions\u201d. But Griffiths ignored their warnings and went ahead with the meeting \u2013 attended by hundreds \u2013 all desperately seeking guidance from King on how to stem the flow of young lives. King and Griffiths say most of the suicide prevention teams in Kaitaia refused to attend. \u201cI know for a fact that Nina got a lot of flak for organising the meetings, and told she was a silly little girl who didn\u2019t know what she was doing,\u201d says King. \u201cBut she was absolutely right, her approach is backed up by the latest research, that talking about suicide is what communities need to do. There are a lot of young people up there who feel like no one cares about them, and no one loves them, they feel hopeless. Until that is addressed and brought into the light, the stats will continue to rise.\u201d Griffiths\u2019s determination to face the deaths head-on may have inspired others to reject the mounting negativity surrounding their town, and since August a small but perceptible change has begun, with no more homicides or suicides recorded. The Facebook group \u2018I love Kaitaia\u2019 has hundreds of members, and bumper stickers and T-shirts with the slogan are worn proudly by the town\u2019s residents. Musicians have written songs extolling the virtues of their Far North paradise, and trees have been strung with streamers; the once-weed strewn garden beds planted with red and pink geraniums. Formal and informal mentoring and guardian relationships are also tentatively being broached. In a coup for the town, last week the Warriors rugby league team flew in on the royal air force DC3 for a three-day visit, with the sole mission of lifting morale. \u201cBeing dubbed the murder capital made people really angry, and they wanted to fight back, because we love our home,\u201d Griffiths says. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be defined by death.\u201d In New Zealand, crisis helplines can be found here. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. Hotlines in other countries can be found here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
