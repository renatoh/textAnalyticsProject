The Swedish schoolgirl posted a tweet overnight calling out the \u201chate and conspiracy campaigns\u201d run by climate deniers like Bolt, adopting his insult that she was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d and turning it back on him. The widely read Herald Sun columnist and Sky News commentator used his significant platform to take aim at the 16-year-old campaigner, dismissing her followers as members of a cult and disparaging her decision to sail across the Atlantic in a high-speed racing yacht to attend UN climate summits in the US and Chile. \u201cThunberg has announced she\u2019s finally going to the United States, the last bastion of the heathen, to preach the global warming faith to the Americans,\u201d Bolt wrote. \u201cOf course, she\u2019s going by racing yacht, because she refuses to fly and heat the planet with an aeroplane\u2019s global warming gasses.\u201d The highly personal character assassination published in Rupert Murdoch\u2019s tabloids repeatedly referred to Greta\u2019s mental health, saying she was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d, \u201cfreakishly influential\u201d and \u201cstrange\u201d. \u201cI have never seen a girl so young and with so many mental disorders treated by so many adults as a guru,\u201d Bolt wrote. \u201cFar more interesting is why so many adults \u2013 including elected politicians, top business leaders, the Pope and journalists \u2013 treat a young and strange girl with such awe and even rapture. \u201cHer intense fear of the climate is not surprising from someone with disorders which intensify fears.\u201d Bolt even described Greta\u2019s younger sister as having \u201ca spectacular range of mental issues\u201d. But the campaigner sees her condition not as a disability but as a gift which has helped open her eyes to the climate crisis. The teenager, whose solo protest last year sparked the Fridays for Future global school climate strike movement, is taking a year off school to attend the summits, on 23 September in New York and 2-13 December in Santiago. Bolt said Greta was wrong on climate change because \u201cthe evidence does not suggest that humanity faces doom\u201d. The editor of the Herald Sun, Damon Johnston, did not respond to a request for comment. Attacks on the teenager are commonplace in the rightwing media. On the same day Bolt\u2019s column appeared an anonymous column in the News Corp broadsheet the Australian referred to Greta as \u201cthe pig-tailed soothsayer\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
