Some people, depressingly, wanted Brazil to win the 2002 World Cup simply in order to stop Germany. But that was not the primary motive of the majority. Most people wanted Brazil to win because they play better football. Unfortunately, one of the times they did so was against England, but few will dispute that Brazil deserved either that win or their success against Germany in the final. Ronaldo's two goals yesterday confirmed him as one of the great players, but there were enough other moments from Rivaldo, Ronaldinho, Kleberson and the rest over the past month to put the issue beyond doubt. When it comes down to it, people's choices are not complicated. We still prefer to see sport as entertainment, not as war by other means. There is a lesson from this World Cup for the football industry in this country. In these islands, and in Europe in general, we pride ourselves on our passion and commitment to football. We like to think of ourselves as the best in the world. But we are not. The truth is that European football, with its emphasis on organisation, fitness, strength, speed and professional fouling, has been found wanting throughout the 2002 competition. One after another, the limitations of our teams and our methods have been exposed. Even today, when the European model of football has become global (notably in South Korea, Turkey and the US during this competition), it is unglobalised teams like Senegal and, most gloriously of all, Brazil that capture the imagination. They do it because they are more skillful, more daring and, ultimately, more entertaining. Football is only a game, but it really can be a beautiful one, and Brazil keeps that flame alive in the face of the boring global style churned out in Europe. That is why Brazil deserved to win and why so many people everywhere are pleased that they did."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
