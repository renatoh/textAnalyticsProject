Or maybe it's simply the fact that people in the north-east want tougher leaders to try to wrestle more power from the far away Westminster government. What is certain is that today's yes votes in London and the north have the potential to rehabilitate Tony Blair's ailing policy of bringing in directly elected mayors to run the country's towns and cities. Mayors have not been warmly received in the four months since the borough of Berwick-upon-Tweed held the first referendum on the issue. Until today, just seven polls had been held and only two council areas, Watford and Doncaster, had voted in favour. Worse still, the turnouts were low, falling to just 10% in Sunderland last week. The government promised that mayors would be more efficient, more accountable and, most of all, that they would help re-engage the public in local democracy. Ministers have issued warm statements about mayors, most notably in their general election manifesto, but they have refused to give solid political leadership on the issue despite early rumours that they would actively promote both mayors and referendums. Now that the policy looks a little more successful and a little less embarrassing, that could all change. The country will now have at least six mayors, and three of them are in Labour's north-east heartland, covering the constituencies of local government secretary Stephen Byers and former Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson. Policy specialists at the pro-mayor New Local Government Network thinktank have often argued that there will be a \"domino effect\" if the policy is taken up by enough councils. If a certain critical mass is reached, the argument goes, people in other local authority areas will see the advantages offered by mayors and want their own. John Williams, the network's executive director, said: \"At the moment, Rudy Giuliani is probably the most well know local government leader in the world, and his profile and dynamic leadership qualities may well have influenced voters to back a yes vote in a majority of referendums.\" A combination of media coverage and success breeding success will then take over until many of England's major cities have a mayor. The critical mass has probably not been reached yet. For one thing, today's results do not include any major cities - a Birmingham or Manchester is badly needed if the government wants mayors to spread. Brighton and Hove, the only city to go to the polls yesterday, voted against and the ultra-modernising, distinctly New Labour council will actually be implementing a distinctly old-fashioned form of government - a slimline version of the century-old committee system. Yesterday's referendums will not be the last. Durham and Plymouth are among those who plan a ballot over the coming months. The government may also force referendums on reluctant councils such as Birmingham and Bradford. Today's result does not guarantee the long-term success of the mayoral project. But, for the first time, it looks like the policy might actually have a bright future, rather than becoming a simple monument to voter apathy and ministerial vanity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
