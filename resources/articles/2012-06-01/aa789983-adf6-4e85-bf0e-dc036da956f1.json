As the prime minister arrived in Brussels for the EU summit, the Conservative Home website reported that nearly 100 MPs want a referendum in the next parliament. The move came as the prime minister signalled to eurosceptics that he would fight hard to preserve Britain's \u00a32.7bn annual EU rebate in forthcoming budget negotiations. Cameron told EU leaders the rebate remained \"fully justified\" amid fears that Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is planning to abandon an informal Anglo-French non-aggression pact on EU funding. Meanwhile, a third of the parliamentary Conservative party signed a letter, organised by MP John Baron, demanding a guarantee of a referendum in law. The letter called on Cameron \"to place on the statute book before the next general election a commitment to hold a referendum during the next parliament on the nature of our relationship with the European Union\". As he arrived in Brussels, the prime minister said: \"I completely understand and in many ways share people's concerns about Brussels getting too much power. That is why this government legislated to put in place an absolute lock so that governments cannot pass powers from Britain to Brussels without asking people first in a referendum.\" Cameron's remarks show that, for the moment at least, ministers will only envisage a referendum if powers are transferred from Britain to the EU. But the MPs believe that the current negotiations in Brussels, which will see greater fiscal co-ordination in the eurozone, may transform the EU so deeply that a referendum is necessary. Ministers may also be tempted to offer a referendum along the lines of the Baron letter in the Tory manifesto for the next general election to ward off a threat from the UK Independence party in the 2014 European parliamentary elections. The letter was disclosed as the prime minister made clear in Brussels that Britain would fight any moves by France to dilute Britain's rebate. His intervention was aimed at Hollande, who appears to be distancing himself from an informal deal agreed by Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy. The prime minister will use an imminent meeting to ask Hollande to uphold the deal in which Britain agreed not to press too hard for reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). In exchange, Sarkozy agreed to ease traditional French demands for the scrapping of the rebate. A UK official said the prime minister would outline the strength of his feeling at the EU summit on Thursday night. \"The prime minister \u2026 will make very clear that the UK abatement is not up for negotiation. Our view is that the UK abatement remains fully justified because of the distortions in the EU budget. That is not an issue that we are willing to negotiate.\" The official added that the prime minister had decided to raise the rebate before the EU embarks on a fresh set of negotiations over the its budget for 2014-2020. The official said: \"We are going to raise the abatement because we think that as we enter this process, it is important for people to have absolute clarity about our position.\" Britain receives \u00a32.7bn back from the EU each year as part of a deal negotiated by Margaret Thatcher in 1984. The former prime minister said that Britain received an unfair budget deal when it joined the then EEC in 1973 because it paid a disproportionate amount into the CAP. France, which had vetoed British membership of the EEC in the 1960s, has traditionally benefited from CAP spending, which still accounts for 40% of the EU budget. Britain has pointed out that agriculture only accounts for 1% of the EU's economy. The prime minister is determined to resist any dilution of the British rebate because he has been highly critical of Tony Blair's decision to forego \u00a37bn in the past seven year budget negotiations. These were concluded in the final days of the UK presidency of the EU in December 2005. The former prime minister said he had no choice but to agree to a cut in the rebate after ten new EU members, mainly from eastern Europe, joined in 2004. Every EU member contributes to the British rebate. The arrival of the new member states meant that, without reform, Britain would have become one of the largest beneficiaries of EU spending. As one of the EU's largest and richest members Britain is traditionally a net contributor. Blair says he resisted a French move to abolish the rebate altogether by placing the CAP on the table. The current budget negotiations are being led by the senior treasury official Peter Curwen who was heavily involved in the 2005 negotiations as the Treasury representative in Brussels. John Cunliffe, another Treasury official who is now Britain's EU ambassador, was despatched by Gordon Brown to monitor the negotiations at the EU summit in December 2005. Jonathan Powell, Blair's former chief of staff, wrote in his memoirs that Brown was highly secretive about the Treasury's numbers during the negotiations. Powell said he and Blair were forced to kidnap Curwen to discover the then chancellor's thinking in the run up to an EU summit under the Luxembourg presidency in June 2005. Powell wrote: \"Given the Treasury's refusal to share information with us, we had real trouble working out what the financial implications for Britain of the Luxembourg proposal would be. In desperation, we kidnapped the Treasury's expert at the UK mission in Brussels and took him with us to Luxembourg so that he could explain to us what the offer really meant. \"He was enormously relieved when we finally let him go. He didn't mind that he was being dumped in Paris, the next stop on our trip, without a passport or any money. He just wanted our assurance that we wouldn't tell the Treasury that he had been travelling with us: that would blight his career for ever.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
