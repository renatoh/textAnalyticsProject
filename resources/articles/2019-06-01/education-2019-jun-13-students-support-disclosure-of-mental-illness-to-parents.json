The yearly Student Academic Experience Survey, conducted by Advance HE and the Higher Education Policy Institute, asked students about mental health problems for the first time this year. The survey of more than 14,000 full-time undergraduate students found that 66% supported telling someone\u2019s parent or guardian about their mental health issues \u201cunder extreme circumstances\u201d, while a further 15% supported it \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d. The survey found that students were significantly more anxious than other young people. Just 16% reported feeling \u201clow anxiety\u201d, compared with 37% for all those aged 20 to 24. James Murray, the father of a student who killed himself, called last year for the relaxation of data protection rules that deter universities from alerting parents that their child has serious mental health problems. His son Ben Murray, 19, who was studying English at Bristol University, died in May 2018. The then higher education minister, Sam Gyimah, proposed in response that students arriving at university could be asked to opt in to a system that would allow a family member or friend to be contacted if they developed serious mental health problems \u2013 something that has now been introduced at Bristol University. Alison Johns, the chief executive of Advance HE, said: \u201cStudent wellbeing remains a huge concern, and if a green light were needed for changes to allow universities to contact parents and guardians where an individual may have mental health problems, we have a very strong signal here in support of that change.\u201d The survey also found that 41% of students perceived \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cvery good\u201d value from their course \u2013 the second consecutive year with a three percentage point improvement. Twenty-nine percent of students perceived \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cvery poor\u201d value, a drop of three percentage points since last year and five points since 2017. For those who thought they were receiving good value from their course, teaching quality was the main reason cited (64%), whereas tuition fees were the main reason cited by students who thought they were receiving poorer value (62%). The study detected small changes to average contact hours and workload. Since 2015, there has been a decline in independent study from 15.2 hours a week to 13.8, and an increase in timetabled contact hours from 13.4 to 13.9 hours. Johns said the findings pointed to an emerging trend in students\u2019 positive perceptions of value for money, which was \u201cwelcome and encouraging\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly pleasing to see teaching at the core of this improvement, and it also reflects good leadership and sound governance which Advance HE is committed to supporting,\u201d she said. Nicola Dandridge, the chief executive of the Office for Students, said the survey painted a mixed picture. \u201cIt is positive that the proportion of students who believe their course offers value for money has increased for a second year. \u201cHowever, with fewer than half agreeing their course is good value, there is clearly more to do for universities to understand and act upon what constitutes value for money in higher education.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
