Those were Michael Palin\u2019s favourite subjects \u2013 broadly defined \u2013 at school, and they\u2019re the threads connecting what might otherwise look like a crazily paved career. That\u2019s the argument, tenuous at times, of this solo show, in which the ex-Python delivers a fascinating precis of his 2018 naval history book, Erebus, and a whistle-stop tour of the preceding six decades of his professional life. It is as entertaining an evening as you\u2019d expect from telly\u2019s Mr Congeniality, although the seriousness of the history lecture might surprise those who stumped up without reading the small print. Palin spends on hour tracing the journeys of HMS Erebus to Antarctica and back, then on its doomed mission to navigate the Northwest Passage. There are slides \u2013 maps, daguerreotypes of the protagonists, snaps of Palin\u2019s travels \u2013 and touching quotes from sailors\u2019 letters home. His book is available \u201cat all good bookshops,\u201d says Palin \u2013 though one might doubt, come the interval, whether there\u2019s much about Erebus left to learn. The second half recounts Palin\u2019s prior career, from boarding school to Oxford to having petals strewn at his feet by film and TV\u2019s powers that be. I exaggerate, but only slightly. His has been a gilded life, a fact sportingly acknowledged with reference to a spoof award he once received from Private Eye. We\u2019re led from Goon Show fandom via university friendship with Terry Jones to his writing break on The Frost Report. Then comes Monty Python: he reads out a prim list of cuts to Holy Grail proposed by the censor, and scenes that never made Life of Brian\u2019s final script. Save a brief update on Jones\u2019 health (he was diagnosed with dementia in 2015), there are few insights, intimacies or gossip. There\u2019s barely time: an hour on stage can\u2019t do justice to a 55-year career. Certainly, the inner Michael \u2013 assuming there is one beneath the courtly and affable veneer \u2013 remains as obscure as the wreck of the Erebus these last 150 years. But if the show only skims the surface, this compendium of clips, anecdotes \u2013 and a closing Lumberjack Song singalong \u2013 is delivered with characteristic humour and good grace. \u2022 At the Cambridge Corn Exchange on 9 June. Then touring until 7 July."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
