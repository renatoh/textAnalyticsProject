Birmingham's plc chairman and co-owner, whose bail has been extended from the end of June to the end of July, believes that the outstanding issue at St Andrew's relates to tax and should be resolved through a tribunal rather than the courts. He claims that the amount in question is \u00a380,000, which is understood to relate to the loan signing of Ferdinand Coly in 2002, and argues that the amount is disproportionate to the time and money that has been invested in the investigation. \"I'm just flabbergasted that this rolls on,\" said Sullivan, who, along with Birmingham's managing director, Karren Brady, also on bail, has strongly denied allegations of conspiracy to defraud and false accounting. \"It's now down to \u00a380,000 tax on one player. It should be sorted out by an Inland Revenue [HMRC] tribunal, not a criminal case, and the tribunal decides if the money is owed or not.\" HMRC are taking an increasingly prominent role in the investigation, which started under the watch of City of London Police in April 2007. However, no charges have been brought and four of the nine people arrested in relation to the inquiry have since been cleared of any wrongdoing, including the agent Willie McKay, who was released from bail this month. It is now anticipated that the investigation will come to an end within the next three months, with Sullivan claiming that the cost to the public purse must already be well into seven figures. \"Our bills are \u00a3350,000,\" he added. \"That includes legal, accountancy and auditor fees. Those are direct costs we have paid to outside people and don't include any internal costs. Their costs must exceed \u00a31m now. There is no common sense. Common sense says it should be resolved by negotiation.\" Milan Mandaric, the Leicester City chairman, Harry Redknapp, the Tottenham Hotspur manager, and Peter Storrie, Portsmouth's executive chairman, still remain on bail and have all strongly denied any wrongdoing. \"We are all in no man's land,\" added Sullivan. Neither City of London Police nor HMRC would comment last night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
