Steve Cummings, signed up by Lance Armstrong's Discovery outfit after winning gold medals as part of Great Britain's all-conquering track team, will compete in the Giro d'Italia following Ivan Basso's fall from grace. Basso, 2006 winner of the Giro, was the man Discovery wanted to take up Armstrong's cudgel. But the Italian resigned from the team earlier this month after the Italian sporting authorities began hearings on 'Operacion Puerto' - the police investigation into a Spanish doping ring. His departure meant a promotion for Cummings. The 26-year-old has enjoyed considerable success in the velodrome and has raced on the road with a mid-sized Belgian outfit called Landbouwkredit but riding in a Grand Tour for one of the sport's heavyweights is something else again. British cyclist Chris Hoy narrowly failed yesterday in his attempt to break the world kilometre record. The Olympic and world champion was in La Paz in Bolivia, where the existing record was set by Frenchman Arnaud Tournant in 2001, but in poor weather conditions he went 28-hundredths of a second slower, recording 59.103, the second fastest kilo ever."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
