Arsenal\u2019s Europa League defeat against Olympiakos on Thursday removed their most viable route back to the top level, with their hopes now resting on bridging an eight-point gap to fourth place domestically. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Bukayo Saka and Mesut \u00d6zil are among those whose contracts end in 2021, and Arteta admitted Champions League participation will be a huge factor in their thinking. \u201cI think that is a no-brainer,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cEvery player in the world wants to play Champions League and if you talk about having this option on the table players are in a much more open way to join this club or to renew their contract, or [for us] to convince anybody, because we want to be in that competition.\u201d Asked how he would sell his vision to those players in the event Arsenal do not qualify, Arteta was at pains to highlight other factors. \u201cThere are always ways. If it\u2019s not them, it\u2019s their wives, that they are really happy in London. We will find a way, don\u2019t worry.\u201d A bleak financial picture would still hinder his attempts to twist arms. Arsenal announced a \u00a327.1m loss on Friday, with the club admitting their absence from the Champions League had a \u201csignificant impact\u201d. Arteta said planning has already begun for several eventualities and emphasised the need for clear thinking. \u201cI think the damage caused by the club not being in the Champions League for the third season is really big. Financially the impact is enormous, because the structure of this club is built to be in the Champions League and you can sustain that for one year or two, but then after you have to start making decisions. We\u2019ll have a very clear plan of what we want to do and, depending where we are, we have to act like this. \u201cIt will be difficult but this is the situation we are in now. We\u2019ve been in that situation because we haven\u2019t performed as well as the other top four clubs have been doing. We don\u2019t have margin for error with those decisions, so they have to be very thorough and clear processes of where we have to improve and how we are going to do that, and then go forward with no excuses.\u201d The sense is Arteta, who takes his team to the League One promotion-chasers Portsmouth for an FA Cup fifth\u2011round tie on Monday night, has taken on a rebuilding task that would cow many first-time managers but he holds complete confidence in his ability to execute Arsenal\u2019s long-term comeback. \u201cI\u2019m very convinced that the way I want to do it is going to work,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long it is going to take, or the time and the resources, but we will find a way to do it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
