Just last week a report crept out about a group of special psychological operations officers who drive around Afghanistan in an armoured vehicle and blast the locals with Taliban-peeving music like Metallica, Thin Lizzy and the Offspring at earth-shaking volume. The technique is called acoustic bombardment and \u2013 along with sensory deprivation and good old-fashioned sexual humiliation \u2013 is one of the military's favourite non-lethal coercion techniques. The music itself tends to be exactly the type of aggressively macho fare you'd expect. Metallica are always near the top of the pile, along with Eminem, Dr Dre, Bruce Springsteen's Born In The USA \u2013 presumably because officers are experimenting with torture by profound lyrical sarcasm \u2013 and nonsense like Fuck Your God by gormless death metal quartet Deicide. David Gray's Babylon used to be on the playlist but it's fallen out of favour, either because Gray expressed his outrage, or because top brass realised that no crime is serious enough to warrant being made to listen to it more than once within a single lifetime. The problem with acoustic bombardment, though, is that it plainly doesn't work. Just because I'd confess to hundreds of atrocities the second that someone started flapping a copy of St Anger in my face, chances are that the Taliban probably wouldn't. Either they're made of sterner stuff, or they're genetically derived from that boy from school who had a bumfluff moustache, constant body odour and an unwashed Megadeth T-shirt that he always wore on non-uniform days. You know the one. Maybe America is getting its choice of music wrong. In reality, there's plenty of music that could do more damage. Imagine the outcry if soldiers subjected a detainee to all four sides of Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music (probably a side and a half more than Lou Reed ever managed himself). And if they hadn't surrendered after hearing Scott Walker's The Drift in its entirety, then at least there's a good chance that they would have wet their pants in fear afterwards. That's enough to count as a victory in some circles. Then there's Glee. If you were to expose a member of the Taliban to both Glee cast albums, you'd be guaranteed one of two results. You'd either have instant shrieking madness, or a detainee determined to spurn his fundamentalist tenets in order to be himself and follow his dreams no matter what. There, that's taught the American military to torture more effectively. You'll be receiving an invoice from the Guardian soon, US Army."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
