He, perhaps more than anyone, has been subjected to brutal criticism during United's struggles but the midfielder has also had a pivotal part in their renaissance. His own resurgence has coincided with United's most illuminating period of the season, one that has left Sir Alex Ferguson's team contemplating tonight's Champions League tie against Deportivo La Coruna in rejuvenated spirits, and an hour in his company at Old Trafford yesterday showed him to be convinced that he is finally acclimatising to life in England. \"The team hasn't really changed but the attitude has,\" says Veron. \"Collectively I think we had to do something different and I include myself in that. We had to realise there is no guarantee of victory just from wearing the Manchester United shirt because, yes, I think that mentality may have crept in. \"Now, maybe even if it is just sub-consciously, we have realised that it requires more than that. I know, for instance, that I could have played with more consistency. I have to be frank and admit that I didn't play well at times last season. \"I would like to think I always had the confidence of the manager and coaching staff but, deep down, I knew that I could have helped the team do better. It's how you react that counts. The secret is turning the criticism on its head and using it to spur you on.\" Like Ferguson, Veron points to last month's 3-1 defeat at Manchester City as the catalyst for the team's revival. \"When something as bad as that happens, it can be key to your way of thinking,\" he says. \"After that game we all went away and spent a lot of time thinking individually. I think it really hurt our pride. We spoke a lot between ourselves - as much as I can remember anywhere in my career - and we decided that, with the quality we've got, we had to do much better. If I'm honest, maybe it's true that I haven't imposed myself on the team as much as I have done with the Argentina national team or with my former clubs in Italy [Sampdoria and Lazio]. \"I've never wanted to hide behind excuses but it's true that I found it hard to settle in. In Italy I was joining clubs where a lot of changes were being made and it was easy to impose your own style. But at United it was the other way round. This club has had the same players for many years and had a lot of success playing a certain style. So it was me who had to adapt, rather than the other way around.\" Veron now declares himself to be \"much more satisfied\" with his form in a team playing with such drive that David Beckham cannot be guaranteed a starting place tonight, even though he has declared himself fit after a month out with a broken rib. \"Everyone is fighting for their place,\" says Veron. \"No one wants to miss out and the players are rising to the challenge. I would say that, on our current form, we have a great chance of doing well in this competition. Real Madrid are the champions but, after them, there is a group of four or five clubs, of which we are one.\" Reinstating Beckham in midfield would mean drop ping Phil Neville or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, a decision that would feel almost traitorous for Ferguson given their roles in the team's return to form. The United manager confessed last night that he was still undecided although at least the same dilemma does not present itself elsewhere. Neither Rio Ferdinand nor Laurent Blanc has recovered in time to be considered, meaning Mikael Silvestre and Wes Brown will continue in the centre of defence. Manchester United (probable) (4-4-1-1): Barthez; G Neville, Brown, Silvestre, O'Shea; Solskjaer, P Neville, Veron, Giggs; Scholes; Van Nistelrooy. Deportivo La Coruna (probable) (4-4-2): Juanmi; Scaloni, Cesar, Romero, Capdevila; Victor, Sergio, Mauro Silva, Fran; Makaay, Tristan. Referee: T Hauge (Norway)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
