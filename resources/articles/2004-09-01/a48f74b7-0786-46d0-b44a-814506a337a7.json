In fact Southampton's chairman had something far more revolutionary in mind. The arrival of Sir Clive Woodward. Lowe has ignored the usual managerial merry-go-round, eschewed a director of football and chosen a third way. He is convinced many of the principles that Woodward has successfully applied in rugby union are equally relevant to the round-ball game. Woodward may never have trained a football team but Lowe has not hired him to run through corner routines. Steve Wigley remains as first-team coach. Woodward's role is to bring something alongside that in mental and most likely physical preparation, helping to get the maximum from each individual and the team. Lowe is confident Woodward's track record will earn him instant dressing-room respect, and Southampton's players will discover that Woodward's message can be summed up in one word: preparation. If a team prepare well, with all their professional needs serviced by a battery of specialists, he is convinced they will perform well. Woodward does not like the word \"motivation\", believing the key is to get the right people in the same room in the first place. But he is hot on what he calls the \"critical non-essentials\" - the little things which could make the crucial one or two per cent difference between winning and losing. England's rugby squad have to, for example, be punctual, dress presentably, congratulate rivals selected ahead of them and remember they are never off duty. Woodward, who set up his own computer and office equipment leasing company, shares with Lowe a belief that business principles can be successfully applied to sport. While others might see Woodward as a sports coach, he describes himself as a professional engaged in the competitive pursuit of winning. Woodward has said his desire to win the World Cup saw him \"question everything, change anything and leave no stone unturned\". He likes players to \"overdeliver\", stopping at nothing in search of victory. \"Sir Clive has expressed an interest in getting into football and has looked at our academy and other aspects of the club,\" said Lowe. \"If we can learn from him about motivation, improving individuals and becoming world class, then great. And if we can help him then we are very happy, too.\" Clubs have long since employed psychologists, nutritionists and fitness coaches in pursuit of excellence, and the Football Association talked to Woodward this year to see what it might learn, but Lowe has gone beyond that. Perhaps the closest parallel is the successful use by Iain Dowie, the Crystal Palace manager, of John Harbin, a former rugby league coach who specialises in fitness and motivation. If Woodward can help to make Southampton half as successful as he made England, Lowe would be delighted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
