With just days to go until polling day, the Tories suffered one of their worst days of the campaign as Johnson refused on camera to look at a picture of the poorly child and pocketed the phone of the reporter who tried to show it to him. The incident escalated when Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was dispatched to Leeds General Infirmary in an effort to show that the party was taking the case seriously. But Johnson\u2019s team ended up trying to deflect the story on to Labour by wrongly briefing that a Tory aide was \u201cpunched\u201d outside the hospital by a leftwing activist. The claims quickly turned out to be untrue when video footage showed that the adviser was accidentally brushed in the face. \u201cThe Tories are so desperate to distract from a four-year-old boy sleeping on a hospital floor because of their cuts to the NHS that, once again, they have resorted to barefaced lying,\u201d a Labour spokesperson said. \u201cThis is a new low and the Conservative party has serious questions to answer.\u201d John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, tweeted: \u201cJohnson and the Tories lie and they cheat to manipulate the media. A sick child treated on the floor of a hospital and they try divert attention with a dead-cat lie story. Never has our politics sunk so low in our country.\u201d The Tories struggled to get to grips with the story of the sick child after the Daily Mirror printed the picture of him on their front page. In an ITV interview during a campaign visit, the prime minister was challenged about the image of Jack Williment-Barr sleeping under coats on a hospital floor in Leeds as he waited for a bed, despite having suspected pneumonia. Asked if he had seen the photographs, Johnson said he had not. The ITV reporter, Joe Pike, then showed the prime minister the photograph on his phone, describing what it portrayed. Johnson declined to look, saying: \u201cI understand. And obviously, we have every possible sympathy for everybody who has a bad experience in the NHS.\u201d He went on to discuss investment in the NHS and Brexit. Pike pressed the point: \u201cI\u2019m talking about this boy, prime minister. How do you feel, looking at that photo?\u201d Johnson replied: \u201cOf course. And let me tell you \u2026 I haven\u2019t had a chance to look at it.\u201d Pike asked: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you look at it now, prime minister?\u201d Johnson, still not looking at the photo, replied: \u201cI\u2019ll study it later.\u201d Pressed again, he said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll give you an interview now. What we are doing is we are taking this country forward, and we are investing in the NHS.\u201d Johnson then appeared, out of camera shot, to take the phone out of Pike\u2019s hand and put it in his coat pocket. The reporter challenged him: \u201cYou\u2019ve refused to look at the photo, you\u2019ve taken my phone and put it in your pocket, prime minister. His mother says the NHS is in crisis. What\u2019s your response to that?\u201d At this point, Johnson removed the phone and looked at the picture for the first time: \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible, terrible photo, and I apologise, obviously, to the family and all of those who have terrible experiences in the NHS. But what we are doing is supporting the NHS and, on the whole, I think patients in the NHS have a much, much better experience than this poor kid has had.\u201d Johnson ended by handing back the phone: \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have taken your phone. There you go.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn responded by tweeting a video of the exchange with the message: \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t care.\u201d The Labour leader later added: \u201cHe took the phone off Joe. Strange behaviour. I don\u2019t think anyone should behave like that. Whilst sometimes lots of questions from journalists do irritate politicians, that\u2019s the way it is, it\u2019s part of the democratic process. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the kind of behaviour we should be doing \u2013 I would never do that.\u201d At a subsequent media Q&amp;A at the warehouse, Johnson was twice asked about his reaction in the interview, but declined to address the questions, instead talking about investment in the NHS. Asked later by the Guardian why he had not acknowledged the photo, he said: \u201cI did. I did. I did. Next question.\u201d Johnson has previously been accused of showing a lack of empathy, for example during a speech at a police training college in September, when he pressed on with a speech even after a cadet directly behind him half-collapsed. The incident was compounded by the Tories\u2019 apparent attempt to distract from Johnson\u2019s behaviour by wrongly accusing a Labour activist of violence. The party was forced to make an embarrassing climbdown after aides initially briefed that an adviser to Hancock been hit by one of a group of Labour protesters in an incident that it later emerged had been innocuous. Having later been shown footage of the alleged incident, aides were forced to acknowledge that it looked as if the adviser was hit in the face accidentally, but still tried to turn the story against Labour by claiming that the activists\u2019 behaviour and language had been unacceptable. West Yorkshire police later said they were \u201cunaware of any reports\u201d of an incident involving election campaigners at the hospital. Hancock and his aide were both heckled, with people shouting, \u201cShame on you\u201d, \u201cWe do not want you in this country\u201d and \u201cYou are not welcome in this hospital\u201d as they both walked to a waiting car, but a source present at the scene said they had seen no sign of the incident described by Tory aides. The aide to the health secretary has not responded to a request for comment. The chaotic day for the Tory campaign came after Johnson criss-crossed target seats in north-east and south-west England by chartered plane. The prime minister acknowledged criticism over the environmental cost of taking a short 25 minute flight between Doncaster and Teesside, but insisted the carbon emissions had been \u201coffset\u201d. On Tuesday, Johnson is due in Staffordshire, where he will rail against the threat of tactical voting to his chances of getting a majority. The pressure remained on the Tories on Monday evening as further reports emerged of long wait-times in NHS facilities. Birmingham Children\u2019s hospital confirmed one young patient had been left for 17 hours in A&amp;E on Saturday, saying it had been \u201cexceptionally busy over the last two weeks\u201d. Giving context, a spokesman said the average waiting time that day was about four and a half hours. Tuesday\u2019s Daily Mirror ran another story about a sick child the paper said had been made to wait for hours before being seen. The Mirror reported that nine-month-old Lily Webb had spent six hours on a chair in A&amp;E with just her mother\u2019s cardigan as a blanket. The front page story bore the headline: \u201cHere\u2019s another picture you won\u2019t want to look at, Mr Johnson.\u201d The Independent said it had seen a leaked NHS email that said a 12-year-old with learning disabilities and mental health issues had spent 57 hours in an Essex hospital\u2019s A&amp;E department waiting for a specialist bed to become available. The trust declined to comment on Monday evening. Speaking on the campaign trail earlier on Monday, Corbyn said the Tories\u2019 response to the case of the sick child had been unacceptable. He said: \u201cThey\u2019ve had nine years in office, and whilst they now claim they are funding the NHS, they are not; they\u2019re not even beginning to make up the shortfall it\u2019s had over the past nine years. \u201cWe are determined that we\u2019ll put \u00a326bn in, which will over time amount to \u00a340bn into the NHS, to ensure it\u2019s properly funded \u2013 but also social care and mental health services.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
