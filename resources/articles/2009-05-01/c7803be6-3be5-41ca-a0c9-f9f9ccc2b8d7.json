Halfway through the press conference, the screen behind them was illuminated with the faces of four more men \u2013 the sculpted profiles of Russell Maliphant, Wayne McGregor, Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui and Javier de Frutos. It had turned into a testosterone-fest. The first thing it's worth saying on this issue of women choreographers is this: there are tons of British women making good work, from Shobana Jeyasingh to Cathy Marston. But the buzziest names in the British game right now are men's: McGregor, Maliphant, Khan, the UK-based Venezuelan de Frutos, the UK-based Israeli Hofesh Shechter. Odd, really, when you think that the dance profession as a whole is predicated on the skill and finesse of women. Odd when you think that modern dance was pioneered by women such as Martha Graham. So what's going on? I asked various people to give me some thoughts for a short piece in today's paper. A combination of factors was blamed. First, the practical question of running a company. Dance is perhaps different from other artforms in this: the young choreographer will almost certainly build a company around them. That might happen in straight theatre, but it's much less a necessary feature of the work of theatre-directing. The sheer hours and the financial instability are absolutely against anyone who wants to combine running a dance company with being the chief carer in a family. So there is a drop-out rate. Second, a bunch of less tangible things. People talked of an idea that in dance \u2013 a fairly retiring artform compared with others in any case \u2013 men are better at putting themselves forward. That the culture at the moment favours the kind of virile, sexy, athletic image of the male choreographer. One person I spoke to even said that part of the problem lay with the overwhelming proportion of straight-female and gay-male dance critics, who talk of the \"sexiness\" of a certain kind of male dancer-choreographer. There was mention of an idea that such virile, athletic males were a much more fashionable marketing proposition than women. Someone said that it was actually easier in the 1980s \u2013 before dance was so international and so fiercely marketed \u2013 to make work seriously as a woman than it is now. Dance Umbrella is running a debate on this issue in the autumn \u2013 I look forward to it with interest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
