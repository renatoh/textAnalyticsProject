Buoyed by the Conservative lead in one poll slipping to just two points \u2013 despite an eighth day of damaging revelations about his character \u2013 Brown will set out plans to shore up police presence on the streets to convince the public that crime is being tackled. Ministers, including Ed Balls, Ben Bradshaw and Yvette Cooper, lined up to welcome the latest poll results, which put the Conservatives on 37%, Labour on 35% and the Liberal Democrats on 17%. The Sunday Times/YouGov survey, conducted in the wake of the allegations about bullying at No 10, recorded the lowest Tory lead in two years and put Labour on course to form a minority government. But the ministers were also forced to defend Brown from further allegations after one of his own senior advisers was recorded by a Mail on Sunday journalist revealing how he was left \"shocked and upset\" after the prime minister \"barged past him\" on the way to a meeting. Stewart Wood, a foreign affairs adviser in Downing Street, said today: \"As I recall, he [Brown] was in a hurry that day, and barged past me on his way in to the room, but he didn't shove me. It did annoy me at the time, but it was an isolated incident.\" In a speech in Reading tomorrow to coincide with the Home Office's publication of a new neighbourhood policing strategy, Brown will challenge councils and police authorities to meet the government's pledge to protect and improve frontline law enforcement as the public spending squeeze hits. Brown will argue that while recorded instances of crime have fallen over the last 10 years, there is still a fear of crime that needs to be tackled through a more visible presence of the police force on the streets. He will say: \"My challenge to local authorities and police authorities around the country is to match our commitment to protecting frontline policing \u2013 or else explain to their communities why they are not prepared to do so.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
