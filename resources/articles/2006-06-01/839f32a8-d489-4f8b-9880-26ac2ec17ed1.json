Montgomerie, who according to Casey 'played brilliantly' to go out in 32, took 37 to come back and, on being asked whether his weariness was mental or physical, said: 'Think of any tiredness you like and I've got it.' Monty set about trying to put the field in their place with that impressive outward nine. He was on the green of the long 2nd in two for his first birdie and followed with a series of magnificent strokes at the 6th, 7th and 8th, all yielding birdies. He was inches from a hole-in-one at the 6th, hit a second to three feet at the next and holed from 12 feet at the 8th, to move to four under for the eight holes and 14 under overall. If there was a mistake made it came at the long 9th, where by bunkering his second he was only able to make par. But the Scot was clearly enjoying himself on a course where, in 2002, Adam Scott won with a total of 262, 26 under par. As Casey remarked earlier in the week: 'Other courses are less scary after you've played Winged Foot [in the US Open]. You can't relax here, but you can breathe.' Kenneth Ferrie, a creditable sixth last week, was asked if Gleneagles appeared easy to him after the rigours of Winged Foot, and said: 'Anything would be relatively easy compared to what we had over there, but this is still a test.' Casey, one ahead of the third-placed Montgomerie in the European Order of Merit, went to the turn in 34, with birdies at the short holes, the 4th and 6th, but it is the long holes that really interest him. There are five of them on this par 73 course and the Englishman says: 'They play into my hands a little bit because there are a few bunkers I can take out of play with my length off the tee.' The 12th, at 503 yards, really played into his hands. On comfortably in two, his eagle putt took him to 12 under, and challenging. He then went on to birdie the 14th, while Montgomerie dropped his first shot of the day. Casey rolled in a 30-footer, but the Scot, who had bunkered his second, went through the green with his third, chipped to seven feet and had to hole that to prevent a double bogey. Suddenly, having done nothing drastically wrong, Montgomerie had lost his lead and Casey, who won his first European tour event here in 2001, was looking increasingly confident. The 18th, at 533 yards, was out of range for Montgomerie, but well within the Englishman's capabilities. He was able to hit two huge shots on to the front of the green, while the Scot was still hitting half a wedge for his third. But Monty misjudged it, leaving himself a 20-footer for a birdie, while Casey was twice as far away, but putting for an eagle. He missed, but managed a safe birdie, taking him to 15 under, while Montgomerie, with some of the earlier spring in his step now departed, parred. He had birdied only two of the five par fives, tantamount to giving away shots. Despite all that has happened to him lately, Montgomerie was not in sole possession of the attention in Scotland. Sam Torrance, the European Tour's iron man in terms of tournaments played, was competing in his 699th event and is planning to make it 700 when the Tour visits Loch Lomond for the Scottish Open in July. Asked if he was reserving the landmark event for a tournament in Scotland, Torrance, who had a 69 yesterday for a sevenunder, 212, said: 'Well, it'll be nice. But it wasn't specifically planned - I mean I started this in 1972 so it would have been a helluva plan.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
