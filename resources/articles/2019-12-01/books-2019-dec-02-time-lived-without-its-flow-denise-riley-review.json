The book will be appreciated by its readers precisely because it resists false notes. It was clear from Say Something Back (2016), Riley\u2019s unforgettable poetry collection, which included a poem about the death of her son, that she has, emotionally, perfect pitch. It was apparent, too, that she is an out-of-the-ordinary narrator \u2013 approaching her son\u2019s tragedy crab-wise. It is only halfway through this new book that we learn that Jake was found dead in a still-running bath, having possibly died of a heart attack. These facts are offered not to satisfy our anxious curiosity but noted almost incidentally as Riley pores over his autopsy, wondering whether she might have prevented his death. Max Porter, whose Grief Is the Thing With Feathers (2015) was a startling bestseller about the loss of a parent, contributes a moving introduction to Riley\u2019s book, claiming that it has been \u201chanded from reader to reader like a secret\u201d. I can believe this. No sooner had I started reading than I found myself thinking of Emily Dickinson, and not only because I was reminded of her by Porter\u2019s title. Dickinson\u2019s line \u201cAfter great pain a formal feeling comes\u201d perfectly describes Riley\u2019s tone \u2013 formal at her most exposed, withheld yet revelatory. But one would need to think carefully about the word \u201cafter\u201d. For Riley\u2019s compelling thesis concerns the strange way in which sequential time is arrested after a sudden death. In one sense, there is no \u201cafter\u201d. She finds herself captive to the present tense. It is as if she has died yet is more alive than ever: \u201cYou are cut down, and yet you burn with life\u201d. Carrying her son in her mind is a mother\u2019s continuing duty of care. In the first grip of grief, Riley hears language more acutely \u2013 the world\u2019s slipshod tactlessness is all around. She writes about how kindly intentioned people say they can\u2019t imagine how she feels. She argues that they should try (her book will help). She observes the world\u2019s obliviousness: \u201cwhere people rush about loudly, with their astonishing confidence. Each one of them a candidate for sudden death, and so helplessly vulnerable \u2026 Later everyone on the street seems to rattle together like dead leaves in heaps.\u201d Riley is outside time \u2013 a time that, she fancies, she might be sharing with the dead. She writes from a brink, describes a \u201cpaper-thin\u201d existence, as though detained at a border crossing. She is wary of muffled language, of words that seem to tiptoe, of vocabulary\u2019s low-lights. She is not keen to apply \u201csorrow\u201d, \u201cgrief\u201d or \u201cmourning\u201d to herself. She rejects \u201cdied\u201d too, as \u201can increasingly silly verb\u201d, and exclaims: \u201cWhat a lumpish little word: \u2018dead.\u2019\u201d And \u201cashes\u201d, as she movingly relates, is an impossible word for other reasons. Talking to the undertakers the day after her son\u2019s death, she cannot heave \u201cashes\u201d into her mouth. The wrong words \u2013 like her dead leaves in heaps \u2013 pile up. \u201cThere is no specific noun,\u201d she reflects, \u201cfor a parent of a dead child.\u201d You start to understand that her experience of bereavement is beyond language as well as time. Not that this deters her from a quality of articulate witnessing that makes this book essential reading. Her almost-denial: \u201cHe still hasn\u2019t come home\u201d is set against almost-acceptance: \u201cIt still seems ludicrous to decide, finally, that I shall not see that face on this earth.\u201d One wonders if that \u201cludicrous\u201d is a nod to Jake\u2019s character (\u201cquietly wry and yet completely without guile\u201d). I would love to have heard more about him, while recognising the book was not intended to be a portrait. Riley ends by considering what a literature of condolence might involve and looks at rhyme as a means of moving a poem on \u2013 in a way, comparable to life returning \u2013 nearly the same, always different. And she hints at the wrench of reacquainting herself with sequential time \u2013 a recovery sometimes experienced as a new form of loss. \u2022 Time Lived, Without Its Flow by Denise Riley is published by Pan Macmillan (\u00a39.99).
