The Laming inquiry into Victoria's death identified 12 occasions when the most basic intervention might have led to her being saved. In the event, the government has now produced a much broader-based document. This makes sense, given the government's new emphasis on prevention. This welcome move means that a long sought-after goal identified by researchers has been adopted by ministers: earlier intervention with children in need. The aim is to pump out more information, advice and support for families in trouble. The helpline run by ParentlinePlus will be expanded and 800 new children's centres will be set up in disadvantaged neighbourhoods, along with more parenting courses for which there is huge demand. Sensibly, ministers have rejected the idea of a national child protection agency because it is impossible to separate children in need from children at risk. Similarly, they have rejected Laming's proposal for a new cabinet committee for children, with a national agency below it. Responsibility will rest where it should, at a much lower level. One of the best parts of the plan is the much clearer accountability it should create - with each individual child's case having a named professional as the key coordinator and, above them, a director of children's services in 150 local councils, with the remit of integrating education and children's social services. Yesterday marked the beginning of the end for the traditional provision of social services - once the fifth arm of the welfare state - but the break-up had been signalled long ago. Even before Alan Milburn's speech to social service directors last October - headlined by Whitehall's press release as \"Time to break up old monoliths\" - mergers had been evolving, but with housing and health, rather than education. Now it is education's turn, with local councils required to set up children's trusts to commission and provide children's services by 2006. Much less contentiously, there will be an independent children's commissioner for England, a post which already exists in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, though the English version will not take up individual cases, but instead identify shortcomings, take up causes and report annually to parliament. There are a host of sensible proposals for improving the recruitment, retention and esteem of children's service workers. There are three caveats. Children's services, which represent one quarter of social service budgets, will account for less than one-eighth of the merged departments. They risk being marginalised. Second, merger of departments does not guarantee better coordination, as an inspection last year documented. Standards remain more important than structures. Third, the review was meant to be cost neutral. But it if is to succeed it will require massive investment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
