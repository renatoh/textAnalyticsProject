Researchers, ethicists and lawyers from 14 countries came together for the first time during a three-day conference in Cambridge to produce guidance by which they agreed to abide. International cooperation in the controversial science has been hindered by conflicting national rules. While acknowledging cultural diversity and moral disagreement about stem cell research, the document provides a fundamental ethical framework and guiding principles from which to work. As well as addressing the conduct of researchers, the guidelines urge governments and lawmakers to be circumspect when regulating the science. It calls for governments in countries where stem cell research is illegal not to prosecute their scientists for taking part in research projects abroad. The guidelines aim to prevent a repeat of the case of a South Korean cloning pioneer who was found to have falsified research. Dr Woo-Suk Hwang apologised and resigned from Seoul National University amid claims of serious malpractice. An investigating panel of experts at the university said Dr Hwang had faked at least nine out of 11 stem cell lines. The guidelines are voluntary, and it is up to individual scientists whether they follow the recommendations. Although the system will not be officially enforced, it is hoped journal editors will support and promote high standards, and that funding bodies will take adequate steps to ensure those they fund are carrying out their research in line with international guidance. Dr Ruth Faden, of Johns Hopkins University, said: \"For the first time, stem cell investigators and ethicists have identified specific guidance for how science and society should respond in the face of conflicting national laws and values governing stem cell science. \"It is often difficult for scientists involved in international collaboration to know what their legal and ethical duties are. Moreover, new ethical challenges facing stem cell science, such as the possibility that gametes could be derived from stem cells, must be addressed at an international level if the field is to progress in a morally responsible way.\" Robin Lovell-Badge, head of the division of developmental ethics at the National Institute for Medical Research, said: \"It is vital that something be done to address the restrictions and fear that are hampering the progress of science. \"There is widespread commitment in our field to ensuing that the work proceed under an internationally recognised ethical consensus.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
