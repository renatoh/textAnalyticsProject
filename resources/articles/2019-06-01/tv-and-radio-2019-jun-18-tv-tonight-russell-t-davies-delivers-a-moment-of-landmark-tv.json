Landmark television \u2013 don\u2019t miss it. Mike Bradley Ackley Bridge 8pm, Channel 4 It\u2019s community cohesion in action (emphasis on the \u201caction\u201d) in this eventful new series of the Yorkshire secondary school drama. The education trust that took over at the end of last series has dumped a load of new pupils on headteacher, Mandy (Jo Joyner), and her new senior management team (including Downton Abbey\u2019s Robert James-Collier) are not much help, either. Meanwhile, Nas\u2019s Oxford University interview creates a rift with best mate, Missy. Ellen E Jones Secrets of the Railways 8pm, Yesterday Railway architecture may seem a little niche, but this engaging series ventures into history, too. It opens with the story of Trans-Pyrenees Railway, highlighting a construction process that seems miraculous even by modern standards, and a tangled tale of Nazi gold and wartime subversion. Phil Harrison The Planets 9pm, BBC Two Prof Brian Cox\u2019s awefest moves on to Saturn, telling the story of its transformation from a planet of rock and ice to the ring-toting beauty of today. Cox expertly illustrates the mind-blowing scale of events and enthuses over Nasa\u2019s Cassini probe, which offered a closeup of Saturn\u2019s rings. Hannah Verdier Adolf Island 9pm, Smithsonian Channel This disturbing film follows forensic investigator Caroline Sturdy Colls\u2019s search for a Nazi SS camp constructed in secrecy on the Channel Island of Alderney in 1941. Research suggests that the island was the scene of mass murder, but Sturdy Colls faces resistance from local authorities in her hunt for the mass graves. Mike Bradley Autobahn 10pm, Quest No matter how much jokey banjo music you incorporate, injecting fun into a plodding film about motorway maintenance on Germany\u2019s autobahns will always be an uphill task. The result is an opening double bill to a series (a series!) that is puzzlingly leaden \u2013 unless mashups of road trains, car crashes and pylon-adjustment are your thing. Mike Bradley Film choice The Garden, 11.35pm, Film4 Having tested HIV positive, the rebel-spirit director Derek Jarman embarks on a near-wordless portrait of his garden, nurtured in the shadow of the Dungeness nuclear power station. It is a deeply personal exploration of mortality and Christian cruelty (with Tilda Swinton as the Madonna) in the era of Aids. Paul Howlett Sport choice World Cup Cricket: England v Afghanistan 10am, Sky Sports Cricket. Old Trafford hosts England\u2019s latest group stage game. Women\u2019s International T20 Cricket: England v West Indies 6.45pm, Sky Sports Cricket. First in a three-match series. Women\u2019s World Cup Football: Italy v Brazil 7.45pm, BBC Four.
