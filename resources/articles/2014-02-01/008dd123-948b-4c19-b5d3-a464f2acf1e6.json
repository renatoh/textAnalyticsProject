Ed Miliband's party is unchanged on 36%, compared with a fortnight ago, while the Tories are down 1 percentage point on 29%. Ukip and the Liberal Democrats are also both unchanged on 17% and 8% respectively. The figures will go some way to settling Labour nerves, after some other polls last week suggested its poll lead was slipping. David Cameron continues to enjoy far better personal ratings than Ed Miliband. The Tory leader has a net approval rating of -14%, down from -11% two weeks ago. Miliband, whose score remains steady, is on -24%. Nick Clegg is on a dire -49%, dropping from -42% in the last poll. Opinium also asked which factors people thought explained the shortage of affordable homes in the UK. Population pressure caused by immigration was cited as the reason by 32%, while 17% said the selling of council homes was the main factor and 15% blamed the government's failure to build enough new homes. People were quizzed, too, on policies to ease the housing shortage and to help people on to the property ladder. The most popular measure was Labour's plan to force developers to build on land they own \u2013 or risk losing it. This was backed by 70%, against 7% who opposed it. There was strong support for moves to use the tax system to deter overseas buyers from snapping up property in London (with 58% in favour and 8% against), and for the government's policy of guaranteeing 15% of the value of a mortgage, to help people buy homes with smaller deposits (58% in favour and 14% against)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
