A well-manned and well-marshalled defence apart they played with a startling lack of ambition and quality, rarely threatening a Watford side whose first two games, without bringing a win, have convinced bookmakers there are worse sides in the division \u2013 Sunderland now favourites to snaffle the wooden spoon. \u201cThis league is ruthless and any point is a good point, especially away from home,\u201d said Gareth McAuley, who returned from injury to bolster the Baggies\u2019 back-line. \u201cBut we want to get better. We\u2019ve got a lot of improving to do and a lot of work to do still on the training ground. If we can do that as soon as possible we can move on and start getting wins.\u201d It would be harsh to judge either of the visitors\u2019 starting strikers on the basis of this performance, so infrequently did they see the ball in the attacking third, but there was improvement of sorts once the club\u2019s record signing, Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n, came on in the second half and he seems quicker and more willing to stretch defences than, say, Rickie Lambert. \u201cHe\u2019s a strong, strong player,\u201d said McAuley of the Venezuelan. \u201cI think he gave us a lift and it\u2019s a statement from the club when they go out and spend a lot of money on a player. That\u2019s what supporters want to see. He came on and gave us a threat in behind, which gave us the chance to get up the pitch more. \u201cWe\u2019ve got good players. Up front, everyone\u2019s competing \u2013 well, everyone\u2019s competing for places all over the park. But we know we\u2019ve got to do better, play better, be braver when we\u2019ve got the ball.\u201d McAuley\u2019s manager, with good reason based on this performance, is not convinced that his players are good enough, describing the team as being in transition. \u201cWe want to bring quite a few more in, while there are also going to be people leaving,\u201d Tony Pulis said. \u201cWe need to change things, and the chairman knows we need to improve in certain areas quickly.\u201d Though Saido Berahino missed a late headed chance, it was telling that the Watford goalkeeper, Heurelho Gomes, said this was one of the easiest games he has played in 15 months at Watford. He sprang into action only after the final whistle, when he set to work rescuing the morale of team-mates crestfallen at their inability to convert superiority into victory. \u201cIt\u2019s important to use my experience, because I know how difficult it is in this league,\u201d Gomes said. \u201cSome players felt that we could win, and were more disappointed than the others because they don\u2019t know the game. They think this is a bad result at home. I try to tell them to take the positive from the game as well. \u201cI believe West Brom came to defend a point and take the opportunity when they had set pieces. We knew that before the game, and we tried to do all we could to stop them, to get pressure on them. We tried everything we had and we couldn\u2019t break them down, but it was another good performance. Some of the boys are disappointed, but I am happy because this is just the beginning.\u201d Man of the match Jos\u00e9 Manuel Jurado (Watford)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
