Fury, you suspect, does not always know either. But as he stared into the cold dead eyes of Wladimir Klitschko at the final press conference before their world heavyweight title fight in D\u00fcsseldorf on Saturday, there was no doubting his intentions. He wanted to goad and get under the skin of the WBA, IBF and IBO champion. To play with his mind before his fists mess with his features. \u201cYou look tense Wladimir, come on give us a smile,\u201d Fury whispered, moving closer to his opponent to sniff him like a dog. \u201cOoh, you smell nice.\u201d Klitschko stared back, impassive; his mouth closed as his eyes burned the back of Fury\u2019s skull. \u201cWho looks the heaviest?\u201d continued Fury, laughing. \u201cWho looks the healthiest?\u201d Again Klitchsko was stoic, statue-like. There, but not there. Pre-fight stare downs have more influence on the next day\u2019s papers than the results of major fights. But this one at least told us this: if Fury is experiencing flutters of doubt before the biggest night of his life he is a master at hiding them. And afterwards, when the microphones were up close, Fury pronounced himself satisfied with his work. What did you see in Klitchsko\u2019s eyes, he was asked. \u201cFear. He\u2019s nervous. I can tell. Next question.\u201d What did he smell like? \u201cHe smelt of perfume. Women\u2019s perfume.\u201d Another laugh. How are you going to be able to counter his speed? \u201cEasy. Don\u2019t forget I\u2019m the fastest heavyweight since Muhammad Ali.\u201d He even attempted to mimic Ali\u2019s way with words when he was asked whether he was as confident as he seemed. \u201cOf course I am,\u201d he shot back. \u201cFour more sleeps and it is going to be Christmas early for Team Fury.\u201d In Klitschko he faces an opponent who has won 64 of his 67 fights and has held at least one version of the heavyweight title for the past 11 years. Yet Fury, a 4-1 underdog on Saturday night, has such confidence in his veins that he is predicting a thrilling knockout. \u201cThis is going to be one of my easiest fights,\u201d he insisted. \u201cThat might sound crazy as he is a super champion, but I see so many chinks in the armour and I am going to expose them very quickly. There is nothing that I see that Wladimir does that makes me afraid or makes me think I can\u2019t win against this guy. \u201cHe\u2019s very weak minded and he\u2019s very nervous. He\u2019s got very skinny. He may have stressed that off. I\u2019m feeling fantastic, I\u2019m in the greatest shape of my life and he\u2019s getting knocked out on Saturday mark my words.\u201d There was even an attempt to play geo-politics as Fury responded excitedly to a Russian reporter who wondered whether Klitchsko was too old at 39. \u201cNot only is he getting old, he\u2019s getting knocked out. Russia, I\u2019m going to knock him out for you.\u201d If elite sport really is mostly played in the mind, then you could almost crown Fury the world heavyweight champion already. Yet Klitschko appeared unruffled by a man he described as \u201ccolourful\u201d, a word that appeared to drip with disdain from the boxer\u2019s lips. But while Klitchsko held his counsel, his management team played a video that showed a succession of his opponents, including David Haye, promising to knock out the giant Ukrainian. And then, in the next frame, a Klitschko left-right combination chopped through their bravado. The message was clear: Fury\u2019s antics were not new. As the video played, it was noticeable that Fury turned his head away and looked to the floor. While relations between Klitschko and Fury were cordial \u2013 the pair, at Klitchsko\u2019s behest shook hands before and after the press conference \u2013 the row between the rival camps over the gloves that Fury is due to wear on Saturday became increasingly tetchy. When the contract was signed, Fury agreed to wear Paffen gloves, which are more padded than the Reyes gloves he prefers and have a more rigid thumb design. But after using them for five weeks in training, Fury felt they were hurting his hands. A second prototype was designed, and approved by Fury, but Paffen are yet to deliver them. It was, insisted Fury\u2019s promoter Mick Hennessy, \u201ca matter of health and safety\u201d \u2013 which to the casual observer seems odd phraseology given that two men close to 18 stone will be hammering each other on fight night. But Hennessy explained: \u201cThe gloves have got to be right for Tyson\u2019s hands otherwise he could end up with broken thumbs.\u201d However, Klitschko\u2019s manager, Bernd Bonte, claimed that Fury\u2019s team had used the first pair of gloves for five weeks before complaining. \u201cYou needed five weeks to suddenly realise, \u2018ooh, there is a little problem with this and that?\u2019\u201d he scoffed. \u201cYour way is the old Don King way. When the contract is signed the negotiations begin.\u201d It was at this point Fury intervened excitedly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we settle it like Ronnie Pickering, bare knuckle outside you two \u2013 and let\u2019s get it on,\u201d he said, to cheers from those wearing Team Fury shell suits, and stony silence from everyone else. This being boxing it will all get sorted out in the end, of course. There is too much money at stake for it not to be. Earlier in the day Fury had told the BBC that \u201cboxing has a big problem with drugs\u201d and that he could \u201clook at a man and tell you if he\u2019s full of drugs by one glance at his body with his top off\u201d. Yet when pressed by a German reporter afterwards he insisted his comments were not a dig at Klitschko \u201cbut about the sport in general\u201d. Klitschko\u2019s response when questioned about drugs in the sport was blunt. \u201cI\u2019ve been tested for the past quarter of a century since I was an amateur as an Olympian,\u201d he said. Watching on was Tyson\u2019s father, John, a former bare knuckle fighter who was delighted to be watching his son after being released after serving five years in prison for gouging out a rival\u2019s eye in a fight. \u201cI\u2019m not long out of jail, it was a long sentence and all I want to do is see my son be victorious here,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I die on Sunday, I\u2019ll die happy because I will have seen what I need to see. \u201cThis man doesn\u2019t want to fight Tyson. He knows Tyson is a danger man and he\u2019s been saying it for years. Tyson is like lightning. He\u2019s strong, he\u2019s 27 and he\u2019s mentally as strong as that wall and Klitschko hasn\u2019t got it in his mind to be able to beat Tyson on Saturday night.\u201d Not everyone is as convinced that Fury has the tools for the job. The former WBA heavyweight champion David Haye, who announced that he will fight Mark de Mori in his comeback fight in January, reckons Fury only has a \u201cone in 20 shot\u201d. \u201cWladimir Klitschko is a consummate professional inside and outside the ring,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best guy on Fury\u2019s record is Dereck Chisora, you look at Klitschko and it is a whole different story. This is Tyson\u2019s first introduction to world heavyweight boxing. He has never fought anyone who is a true world class fighter. To go from fighting the Chisoras of this world to go in with a strong, healthy dominant world champion, will be a step too far.\u201d Not that such a sober and level-headed assessment is going to blunt Fury\u2019s confidence. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe this fight would happen but he has proved me wrong,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI hope he has prepared well, and I know he would have done. But I am coming. Old guy, young guy, old champion, new champion. Enough said. Amen.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
