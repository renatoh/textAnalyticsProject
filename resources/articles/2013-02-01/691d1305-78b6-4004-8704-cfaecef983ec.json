Actually, peppering is the wrong word: salting, maybe? Orwell's salt brings out the true essence of his subject matter. His careful language is a joy, although it highlights how loosely we speak today. I've been enjoying the 15-minute late-night readings of Down and Out in Paris and London. Initially I wasn't sure: Joseph Millson's delivery seemed a trifle too soft, too mannered and actory. I didn't want a salty sea dog, but some grit in the sugar might have been nice. And his accents \u2013 Irish and Italian especially \u2013 can be wayward. Still. It's rare to get a voice on the radio to match the voice in your head, and the more I've listened, the more I've enjoyed it. Such beautiful words! Such compassion! Such battened-down humour! Week one was mostly concerned with Paris, where Orwell landed some work in hotel kitchens as a lowly dishwasher. Last week was the London section, which is mostly Orwell hanging with tramps. He describes his fellow non-workers so well you can see them standing before you, hungry, dirty, defiant. A scene where they all washed at a doss house, in a room 20ft square with two bathtubs and two slimy roller towels, is seared on my mind, although of course I've never seen it. Good writing, combined with radio, is amazing like that. Nineteen Eighty-Four is on today, that astonishing schoolkid shocker \u2013 the first of two-part dramatisation, with Christopher Eccleston playing Winston Smith. Should be a guddun. Last night, in Archive on 4's The Road to Nineteen Eighty-Four, David Aaronovitch took us through Orwell's intellectual journey to writing the book. \"How did Orwell, the socialist, write Nineteen Eighty-Four, the bible of the anti-socialists?\" he wondered. By the end of the hour we knew why, if not how. No one can know how. Meticulously researched \u2013 the hallmark of all documentaries that boast producer Phil Tinline at the helm \u2013 we were led through Orwell's experiences in Spain, his disillusionment with Russian communism, his iconoclastic attitude to the second world war (he was anti-Hitler but anti-Stalin too, and wouldn't toe the Allied line when the Russians switched sides). We learned about obscure figures who discussed Trotsky in New York; we felt the atmosphere at the BBC where Orwell worked. Orwell's brain never stopped ticking. He realised that the postwar world could end up being run not by charismatic despots but by managers and bureaucrats. He saw that the lasting threat of the atomic bomb was not obliteration, but stasis: a world ruled by vast super-states unable to conquer or be overthrown. Nineteen Eighty-Four, said one speaker, \"is not a prophecy, it's a reaction to a set of prophecies\". It's a combination of recognisable horrors, once pushed as solutions. On Radio 2 a strange show. Ian D Montfort Is: Unbelievable is, essentially, a standup act on radio. Which can be a good thing \u2013 I'm thinking of Radio 4's Mark Steel's in Town \u2013 but can also leave you in a pickle, wanting visuals to help you out. Montfort, played by Tom Binns, is a character: an onstage psychic, of the badly coiffed rip-off type, who tours social clubs across the land. Not exactly the hardest of targets but one that definitely contains laughs. And there were plenty of those, the audience giggling at Montfort's silliness right from the start. What's really strange about the show is that every so often, Montfort has an attack of the Derren Browns, pulling off stunts that would wipe any cynic's sneers. He accurately guessed what audience members were thinking about (a dead cat called Candy), what actress Angela Griffin had in a sealed box (some big school pants, a piggy bank decorated by her daughter). I think this is called having your cake and eating it. Or having a sidekick whisper stuff to you and eating that. To be honest, it's too hard to tell without visuals. We need to see Montfort's ridiculous hair, the shock on the audience's faces. I hate to say it, but this show would be better on TV."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
