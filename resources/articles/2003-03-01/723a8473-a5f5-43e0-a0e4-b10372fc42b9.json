I know I am not doing the best job I can do. I don't have the time; I don't have the time to plan lessons, to mark books. I'm taking a more blase attitude to paperwork and new initiatives - it is the only way to get through the working week without going mad. In the last year it has got busier. I didn't think it could get busier but it has. I am doing more, partly by choice, but we are overloaded with new intiatives and we never have time to finish one thing before racing on to the next. Other teachers feel this way - there are too many things going on at the same time. For me, the new key stage three strategy for science has meant extra work. Also, I volunteered to become a teacher-governor because no one else felt they had the time for such a commitment, and I thought I could represent the views of staff to governors and help shape college policy. It is more complicated and challenging than I expected and I am still learning. I want to stay in teaching but the job we're doing is not teaching. It is chasing impossible targets, filling in pointless forms, spending more and more of our time inspecting, evaluating and assessing rather than teaching. There aren't enough hours in the day to do the job properly. We have to cut corners, make professional judgments on what is most important. The latest government proposal is to give teachers 10% non-contact time [time not spent with pupils]. It is important because it recognises for the first time that we need time for planning and marking but that is about what secondary teachers get now. We really need about 50% but that is just a dream. It will never happen. I've become even more sceptical about government attitudes but in the last 12 months I've stopped worrying about it. I was frustrated because I could see them spoiling education. Now I'm resigned to it. Does that mean I'm over the hill? The government is now pumping money into getting classroom assistants into schools. This will not help us one iota. We'll have to train them, supervise them, organise them and pick up the pieces when things go wrong. They can't get enough teachers so they're getting less skilled and cheaper people in. Anyone who raises objections to such plans is ridiculed. How can you have faith in anything that is so transparently not going to help? It is always change but with no direction, no cohesion - they change this and it affects that so they change that as well. It happens because the people in charge are politicians and civil servants and not educators. I see a crisis - an absolute crisis - looming in education in the next five to 10 years with a significant number of older teachers retiring and the government not being able to replace them. Pay is very important. We are being awarded a 2.9% pay rise but losing 1% in the national insurance rise, so we are doing more work and, with 1.9% not even keeping up with inflation, getting a pay cut. We are falling further and further behind and it sticks in your throat. People are very worked up about this. It is one of the reasons people are not coming into teaching. They are not paying enough. I still feel valued by the vast majority of parents and pupils who appreciate the job we're doing under difficult conditions. I haven't got any plans to leave teaching at the moment. It would be such a fantastic job if we were given time to do it. It is so frustrating that they [the government] won't trust us to get on with it. They have to control and change it all the time. Public voices: March 21 2002 Science teacher, Linton Village College, Cambridgeshire Salary: \u00a325,000 rising to \u00a327,000 in April I see myself staying a teacher - I've been doing it for 10 years and I think I am getting good at it. The job is the most rewarding and essential job in the country. But I don't think anyone in government gives a toss about us. Compared to a year ago, I still work about the same number of hours as a science teacher and form teacher but I am working harder, feeling tireder and more frustrated than ever before. I feel that however hard we work, we never get the recognition we deserve from the government - when things go right, they claim the credit and when anything goes wrong, we are slated. A lot has changed in education in the last year and no one seems to know where it is going. We get almost daily announcements by Estelle Morris and policies are changing all the time. She reacts to whatever is on the news: if there is a case of bullying mentioned on TV, she announces a crackdown; if there is a complaint about school uniform costs, she issues advice on it. We don't need her to lambaste us daily and tell us the obvious. There are not enough teachers and class sizes are rising. Funding is inadequate: there is not enough money to pay salary increases due in the new school year - the government has said we deserve it but it has provided only 40% of the money. Without more money, it could only be found from the school budget - cutting back on books or IT. I have just passed a threshold and with inflation I will be earning \u00a327,000 a year from April but Cambridge is a very expensive area. I cannot afford to buy a home and I drive a 10-year-old car. My friends in other jobs earn a lot more than me. I envy other people's freedom to go home from work and switch off - I go home and get down to preparing lessons and worksheets. I still feel appreciated by parents and pupils but the way the government treats us is starting to bother me. They treat schools as a factory, a production line to produce bigger and better year after year - they lose sight of the fact that every pupil is an individual. We start from that point every year. The Common Good: March 21 2001 Science teacher, Linton Village College, Cambridgeshire Salary: \u00a325,000 As a science teacher, I plan and deliver lessons, monitor pupils' work, look for ways to help them improve their progress and examine them at the end of the year. As a form teacher, I have the pastoral side, looking after the personal social development of the 27 pupils in my class. I probably work about the average for teachers, 52 hours a week, which is a lot better than the 70 hours I worked in my first two years as a teacher - I'm a lot faster now. I love teaching in the classroom. There's nothing like it when the lesson goes right, and the pupils are making progress and enjoying it. That is what keeps people in teaching. The public thinks we work from 9am to 3pm but that is not what we do. In term time, most teachers devote most of their time to school. It comes before everything else. I get paid about pounds 25,000 a year. That is enough for me because I am single but, as a married man, I would not be able to live around here. I have two brothers in advertising and one has a Lotus. I could earn a couple of thousand pounds more in a private school but I don't think it would be worth it. I would prefer more free time than more pay - I would like time written into the week for organising, planning, marking, and dealing with all the bureaucracy. The best thing about teaching for me is to bump into former pupils and have them tell me what they are doing. I can see where I have had an influence, where I have been able to show them what they are capable of. One recently got her PhD. Most of them appreciate us in the same way that I respect my own teachers. This is why I teach. Parents usually think their own children's teachers are very good. I listen to that rather than the constant barracking from the politicians and the press. I'm not worried by the barracking. I know we do a good job."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
