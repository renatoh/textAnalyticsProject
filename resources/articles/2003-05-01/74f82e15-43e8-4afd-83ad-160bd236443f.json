Damian Green: I think it's very damaging for the government. You can never tell until after elections what stories have played, oddly enough. So I don't know how big an effect it will have. But I know what effect it's having in schools. My emails and post-bag grow by the day, with ever more examples from angry head-teachers and chairs of governors saying: \"How have we got to this stage where the government says we're showering education with money but my school is in deficit and I'm looking at making teachers redundant?\" There's a lot of anger out there about it. TH: Is it illustrative of the government's approach to schools? DG: I think there are two real underlying causes of it. One is the tax increases. If you increase taxes on jobs, like the national insurance charge, then people think of it in relation to the private sector. But of course the public sector is heavily job intensive - 75-80% of the average school's budget goes on staff costs. So if you make employing teachers more expensive, then you make it less likely that people will employ teachers. The other aspect - which I think goes to the heart of a lot of the government's problems with public services - is that the system is so complex, and this is because of the degree of central control they want. If you do have a lot of funding streams, so that every ministerial initiative can be fulfilled, then inevitably what you end up spending the money on is an army of bureaucrats to check that all the money is being spent in the proper way. And if the money's being spent there, it's not being spent on teachers, books and equipment - all the things we want it to be spent on in schools. TH: What would you do to sort out that system? DG: Scrap it and say that instead of having 66 funding streams for secondary schools, give the schools as much as possible and let them spend the money as they see fit. I think that would have two advantages. First of all, a much higher percentage of the money would actually be spent in the schools, which would help solve this year's crisis. But also, even without that, it would be better for the schools to say: \"Our priority this year is resurfacing the playground, buying a new set of French textbooks, employing an extra maths teacher\" - whatever the school's priority is. I know that if I was sitting in Sanctuary buildings I couldn't be sensitive enough to the needs of 25,000 schools. And that's what they're trying to do and that's why it's going wrong. TH: Not only would you simplify the centre, you'd also take the local education authorities (LEAs) largely out of the equation? DG: The government has already done that to some extent. It has the school's block and the LEA block in funding. Now what we've said is that we'd want schools to use the LEAs as they would want - and good LEAs would no doubt continue to provide the services to schools and bad LEAs wouldn't, because we'd give the schools the power to say \"we want to be autonomous, we want to run our own affairs entirely\". So I'm not cutting the LEAs out, I'm giving the choice to the schools. TH: Historically the decline in the turnout in local elections has been accompanied by a decline in the powers of councils. Do you feel these proposals will help revive local democracy or contribute to its decline? DG: It is not surprising that if local government doesn't take decisions in matters that people care about, then people won't bother to vote in local elections, because they'll think \"my vote doesn't make any difference\". So I think actually treating local councils seriously and saying \"we will give you more to do\" is one of the ways to revive interest in local democracy. TH: Iain Duncan Smith has implicitly blamed the government for the rise of the BNP. Do you share that view? DG: Extremist parties flourish if people feel their needs are not being met by the government of the day, and the mainstream parties. And so it's important that we debate sensitive issues, such as asylum policy, in a sensible way. If mainstream politicians say \"we know people care about this but we're not going to discuss it because it's sensitive\", then sadly that leaves a gap for extremists to walk into. I'm sure everyone in the mainstream political spectrum hopes and prays that the BNP doesn't do well because they are a poison in the political system. But we'll only stop them doing well by saying we have got sensible issues that will genuinely address the concerns that people have on these sensitive issues. TH: He also suggested that part of the reason the BNP were doing well was because of a decline in the Labour organisation in the country. Do you think that in certain areas, particularly metropolitan ones, the decline in the Conservative party has contributed to that? DG: It would be foolish to deny that we have had and still have problems in many inner cities. We lack councillors in far too many of our biggest cities and indeed some smaller towns and cities. And one of the things we are seeking to do is to address the problems which are particularly acute in the inner cities - of which education is one - precisely because we think, as a party, we aspire to be a national party. We don't just want to represent leafy suburbs and the shires and so on. We have things to say to people in the inner cities and we haven't said them well enough over the last 10 years or so. I think everyone would admit that. It is the case that there are some cities which have become one party states for the Labour party and out of that have come all the problems of one party statehood - problems of corruption, bad administration - and some of the frustration of that may well be reflected by votes for extremists. It shows why it's important for mainstream democratic parties to compete all over the place. And we're not only trying to do so. Objectively, we're doing better than the other parties at that. We have got significantly more candidates running in the local elections than any other party. And whereas Labour is withdrawing from some areas, it's noteworthy that in my constituency, where Labour has come second in the last two elections, they are only contesting half the seats for the council. That's a party in decline in those areas, whereas our candidates are actually up in numbers. We're doing our damnedest to compete in the inner cities again. TH: So you would concede that in certain areas the decline of the Tory party as an electoral force has contributed to a frustration that there isn't an alternative? DG: I think it's a decline in the possibility of there being a non-Labour council. All other parties need to compete harder there, not least in the interests of the Labour party. People have got to see that there's a possible democratic alternative. That applies to us and to other parties as well. But if we don't they will look for alternatives like the BNP, which are significantly nasty. TH: In his speech last week, Iain Duncan Smith talked more about asylum than he did about education - that's a keynote speech at the start of the last week of the local election campaign. Do you think that balance is right? DG: I think Iain makes speeches about all sorts of things all the time. Three weeks ago he was at one of the teaching union conferences. Iain has taken a deep personal interest in our education policy and will continue to do so because we do see education as a key issue. If you look at the range of speeches he's made, not only did he go to the secondary heads conference, he and I went on a visit to Holland together earlier this year to look specifically at vocational education. This is an area of particular concern in our inner cities and one of the things we want to revive most strongly. So Iain has shown a long-term commitment which will be continued. It's not just about these elections, it's a long term commitment to education as one of our key policy areas. TH: You've said that freeing up schools would require the Tories to bite some bullets - you've said it would result in some things happening in schools that some Conservatives disapprove of. What sort of things do you imagine those to be? DG: I want to see a genuine diversity in schools. That will mean that there will be some parents who say \"I want my child educated this way\", and it may well be a way I would not want my children educated. I think that's fine. As long as the school is meeting general requirements. How any school gets the children over the hurdles which society and parents reasonably expect them to get over, is a matter for the professionalism of teachers. To take one specific example, I have visited quite a lot of the schools which are currently very cheap private schools, run often by parents groups that want progressive education, and they are desperate to be in the mainstream sector. One of the things our state scholarship proposals would do is allow parents to say \"I'm going to take the money the state spends on my child's education and go to this different type of school which somebody has set up\". Many of those schools are operating education theories that I suspect many, particularly small \"c\" conservatives would think \"I don't like that\". The bullet we have to bite as a party is that if we believe in choice and diversity then some people will choose to be diverse in way that we wouldn't particularly approve of. TH: You've laid out a new policy about section 28, saying it's up to parents to decide what should be taught in schools. Would you be happy if parents decide that it be taught that lesbian and gay relationships are as valid a family unit as any other? DG: The issue of sex education is actually what it's about - Section 28 has gone - so we're talking about sex education in schools. In the end I think parents have common sense. As long as parents know what's being taught and they are happy about what's being taught then they are a better judge of what is in their children's interest than anyone else. TH: So you would be happy for it to be taught that that's a valid family unit if that's what the parents want? DG: Schools should stick to the guidelines basically. The department of education puts out guidelines and schools should stick to those guidelines unless a significant majority of parents wants something different. In the end we are putting power in the hands of parents. TH: You've said you'd like parents to be allowed to establish schools ... DG: And commission others to establish schools. It's what works in other countries. Take the example of Holland, where 70% of children are educated in these types of schools. There's a constitutional right that if a certain number of parents say they want another school set up then they can get it. And what happens there is that different groups come along and say \"right, we'll set up a school here, do you want us to run a school there?\" In America, the charters school movement - which is specifically designed for the inner cities - does much the same thing: if the parents think the education is not very good then other people can come in. It's noteworthy that in all other parts of the world, Steiner schools are part of the mainstream education process. There's not a single one in this country that's part of the mainstream school system and yet it's a pretty well tested education theory. Some parents would like it some parents wouldn't. But it does seem to me it is absurd. This particular way of running schools, which some parents have regarded as successful for more than a century now, doesn't exist [within the mainstream education system] in this country because of the very centralised way we run our schools system. TH: Who would you envisage setting up these schools? DG: A whole raft of people - it could be churches, voluntary groups, charities, I suspect there could be not-for-profit institutions set up to do it. I would be relaxed about private companies doing it. One of my visions is that there are people out there who are expert at running inner city schools and why shouldn't we have an inner city schools network? One last group is groups of teachers, when we first announced this a lot of people came up to me and said \"I'm a teacher and this is exactly what they all talk about\". TH: Jarvis? DG: Well if they could prove they could do it well. Though there is clearly pretty serious question marks over ... until we get to the bottom of Potter's Bar then it is eye opening that they've got this contract. But the government has a lot of long standing relationships with certain companies that open eyes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
