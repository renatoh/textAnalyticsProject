The London-born South African saxophonist and composer Dan Stern can boast classical studies with Alexander Goehr and Robin Holloway, and sax lessons from former Miles virtuoso Liebman himself. The set splits into two suites, one being for a high-class band including Binney, Tim Garland and Gwilym Simcock (with Liebman contributing a US-recorded sax-piano duet), the other being a Stern solo exploration with overdubs, at times reminiscent of John Surman's music. Some of the group music suggests the early 1960s jazz/classical Third Stream, some of it the horn-tapestry sound of Bitches Brew, and some the M-Base rhythm-pattern tradition - crisply underpinned by excellent drummer Asaf Sirkis, and inventively explored by Stern, Binney, and a soaring Garland on soprano on the intricate Eye of the Beholder. Perotin and Palestrina get a look in on Stern's unaccompanied episodes - at times quite spookily sinister. The sweepingly resourceful Stern sounds like a big talent flowering."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
