The 25-year-old described the prize as \u201ca huge honour\u201d, citing a childhood spent watching and being inspired by performers at the annual music awards ceremony. She beat fellow nominees Beabadoobee, a solo indie artist signed to the 1975\u2019s label, Dirty Hit, and jazz-influenced songwriter Joy Crookes. Formerly known as the Brits critics\u2019 choice award, the prize has previously predicted the success of artists including Florence + the Machine, Sam Smith, Adele and Sam Fender. Born in Los Angeles, Celeste moved to Brighton with her mother as an infant. She began writing music and performing in bands as a teenager. Age 16, she was discovered by a manager after she posted her first song online. He encouraged her to take professional writing classes; she started working with writers and producers at Trevor Horn\u2019s Sarm studios. Lily Allen signed Celeste to her label Bank Holiday Records, an imprint of Warner UK, and released her debut EP, Milk &amp; Honey, in 2017. The following year, Celeste signed to Polydor. Her single Strange made the Radio 1 playlist, and she was recently named BBC Music Introducing artist of the year. She cites artists including Billie Holiday, Kanye West, Frank Ocean, Diana Ross, Rosal\u00eda and Tyler the Creator as influences, and has supported Michael Kiwanuka, Janelle Mon\u00e1e and Neneh Cherry live. After selling out all of her 2019 London shows, a date at Shepherds Bush Empire in April 2020 also sold out in a few days. Celeste will perform at the Brit awards on 18 February 2020."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
