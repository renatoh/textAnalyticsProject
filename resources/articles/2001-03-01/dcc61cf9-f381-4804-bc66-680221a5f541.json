Some 200 early risers at the University of Lincolnshire and Humberside, along with the President of the National Union of Students, Owain James, were on campus hours before lectures were due to start to demonstrate the need for improvements in student funding. There was a human chain in South London and mass balloon launches nation-wide with students writing their debts on cards to send aloft. In the run up to the general election, National Shutdown Day aims to push student hardship up the political agenda, though the Selby train disaster and the foot and mouth crisis ensure that student protests will not make headlines tomorrow. Education Secretary David Blunkett's recent decision to rule out top-up fees has given the NUS some comfort. Now they are still campaigning for the reintroduction of targeted maintenance grants and raising the student loan repayment threshold above \u00a314,000 so that students do not have to start to pay back loans until they can better afford to. Student debt has trebled in the last three years. Mr James said: \"No matter how frivolous or serious the activity, the message is clear; students are angry that debt is increasing by \u00a31.5 billion per year. NUS estimates that next year's students will each owe an average of \u00a312,000 on graduation.\" Most institutions are compiling petitions and boycotting lectures, but at Luton they will be showing their grief over student debt by wearing black armbands as they stage their protest. Black armbands also appeared among the early risers at Lincoln. Their president Verity Coyle said: \"Students are stereotyped as being lazy and having trouble making it for nine o'clock lectures, our students feel so strongly about the 'Grants not Fees' debate that they are walking out.\" At Aston University in Birmingham students are staging a cardboard city sleep out. Goldsmiths College, London, is joining forces with nearby Lewisham College of Further Education to show that the journey from further to higher education is the most expensive one students will ever make by forming a human chain along the bus route linking the two campuses. Following the NUS support for the lecturers picketing over the last few months UNISON, NATFHE and AUT members are supporting students in today's action. They encourage lecturers not to penalise those who take part in the boycotts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
