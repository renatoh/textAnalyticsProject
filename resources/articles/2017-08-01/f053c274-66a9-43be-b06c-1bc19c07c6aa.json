The man who blew away all competition in his first season in English football spent much of his final press conference before the new season hunkered low, his forehead furrowed, his eyes beaming a combination of wariness and ennui. Three months after winning the league his Chelsea side are down in numbers and it is clear the Italian wants more names in his squad. He will start the season not only without Nemanja Matic, sold to Manchester United for \u00a340m, but missing Eden Hazard and Pedro through injury. He will not talk about Diego Costa, last season\u2019s leading goalscorer who has been frozen out of the first team and is now in legal dispute with the club. He insists his side are not the favourites to retain their crown. Yet the suspicion remains Conte enjoys the adversity he believes his club to be facing. That, in fact, he thrives on it. \u201cAt the start of the season it\u2019s simple to tell that in this league there are probably six top teams and they should fight for the title,\u201d is how Conte summed up the Premier League challenge, which begins for Chelsea at home to Burnley on Saturday afternoon. \u201cI think honestly if you have to give an evaluation on paper, it\u2019s right to not put Chelsea as a favourite. It was the same last season for Chelsea; no one believed we could win the title. This season, in this moment, I agree with these people who think this.\u201d Contained within these remarks is a reminder to the Chelsea hierarchy to get a move on in recruitment. There is also a degree of expectation management, not only acknowledging that Chelsea will have additional Champions League fixtures to contend with this season, but also the more simple fact that retaining the title is hard; as his predecessors Carlo Ancelotti and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho (second time around) found. But the line \u201cno one believed we could win\u201d is just as telling. If those outside the club want to doubt Chelsea\u2019s capabilities, then they are welcome to. They may just come to regret it. Danny Rose and Danny Drinkwater this week joined the lengthy list of names to which the champions have been linked this summer, alongside ongoing targets such as Juventus\u2019s Alex Sandro and Internazionale\u2019s Antonio Candreva. Conte would not talk about individuals \u2013 \u201cthe club knows very well my opinion\u201d \u2013 but he was happy to make a broader point. \u201cIf you have the possibility to spend money and improve the quality,\u201d he said, \u201cI think this is right way to be competitive and fight for something important.\u201d In the absence of new signings Conte\u2019s main message was to stress his support for the group currently at the club. Those players loaned out, he said, had gone for a reason despite what his rivals, such as Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, may suggest. For the Arsenal manager Chelsea had enough players already on their books to fill any gaps, but chose to lend them out. For Conte: \u201cIf the club sends a player on loan for development, that means the club thinks the player is not ready to play for Chelsea.\u201d What that means for those young players who have not yet gone out on loan \u2013 from the Denmark defender Andreas Christensen to the Belgium Under-21 midfielder Charly Musonda \u2013 is unclear. It depends, Conte said, on their ability to deal with consistent pressure, the kind their manager seems to put naturally upon himself. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy when you speak about pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cWith me I am used to it. With young players they are not used to it. It\u2019s very difficult to judge young players only through the training session. But at the right moment you have to take risks because you haven\u2019t other possibilities.\u201d Again, the coded message. One young player who does look likely to earn Premier League minutes is Michy Batshuayi. The striker was bought for \u00a332m from Marseille last season but played only the smallest of roles for the senior side until a late flourish brought four goals in the last five matches of the season. With \u00c1lvaro Morata still being given an in-depth introduction to the Conte way, the Belgian looks set to lead the line in his stead. \u201cI think this is a great possibility for Michy,\u201d Conte said. \u201cHe is playing every game from the start and it is very important for him to play, and to play well. Michy is putting 120% into every moment during training and in the game. For sure we are talking about a young player and he needs to develop, but he is trying to put his best in every moment of the day.\u201d As for Morata: \u201cHe needs time to understand, to adapt to our style. \u00c1lvaro is working very well, improving his physical condition a lot in the last 10 days, and he is starting to understand what I want from him in the game. For me the striker is a really important role and it\u2019s really important to understand what I want from the position.\u201d Demanding more from his players, from his board, from himself, and doing so constantly; this is the Conte way. The phrase \u201c120%\u201d was the most common motif in his last address before the season begins. It is a sizeable increase on the traditional 110%, and surely deliberately so. \u201cAt the moment I signed a new contract I decided to stay to work for this club to give 120% every day for my club and my players,\u201d he said. \u201cFor sure it will not be easy in this part of the season but I do not want to find any excuse for me, my staff or my players. \u201cIn my career I always work with real pressure and it\u2019s normal. The most important thing is to face that pressure in the right way. Sometimes it\u2019s really serious but it\u2019s also important to have laughter sometimes too. Not so much, but sometimes.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
