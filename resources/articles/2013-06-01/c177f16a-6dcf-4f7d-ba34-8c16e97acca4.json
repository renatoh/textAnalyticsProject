The first step is to choose how to sell. There are probably only two models. One is the Thatcherite method of selling to institutional and retail investors via a mass offer of shares. That game is straightforward: give private individuals a discount and sit back and await a rush of orders from bargain-hunters. Mainstream City funds would have to pay a higher price but might feel obliged to do so because the banks are such a large slice of the stock market. But there are several problems. One is the sheer size of the banks. The state's stakes are worth roughly \u00a350bn \u2013 far too much to sell in one go. So 2014 would have to see a partial sale, with the promise of more to follow. Second, there's a technical difficulty that wasn't present in the 1980s. According to Policy Exchange, any discounts to retail investors would have to be offered to all EU citizens. In practice, the sniff of a few cheap shares in Lloyds probably won't provoke drooling in Lisbon or Ljubljana, but the political risk can't be ignored. Third, there's a basic point about fairness. As Policy Exchange puts it: \"Only those taxpayers who could afford to buy the shares could take part in the privatisation, whereas all taxpayers contributed to the bailout.\" Thus the thinktank has presented an alternative model it views as fairer. It's not simple, however. Taxpayers would submit their national insurance numbers to get an allocation of shares that would be held in a nominee account. The government would then set a \"floor price\" for the shares \u2013 say 350p for RBS. If the taxpayer sells above 350p, the Treasury gets the 350p but the individual gets the rest. Policy Exchange is right when it says its idea would cause less disruption to the banks' share prices. The trouble is, there's no wow factor. Osborne would be distributing shares worth, say, \u00a31500 to 25 million people. But there would be no instant windfall for buyers since the Treasury would still be claiming all the value up to the \"floor price.\" The chancellor could gift the shares to individuals, but with the cost of a giant write-down in the Treasury's accounts. So, it's the Thatcherite model versus that of Policy Exchange. But why the rush to sell? Lloyds, in particular, seems to be doing just fine under 39% state ownership."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
