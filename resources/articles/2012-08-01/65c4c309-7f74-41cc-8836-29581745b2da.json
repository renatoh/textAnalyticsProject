Not any more. These days we take for granted the mini-PCs in our pockets that can play our favourite songs and TV shows; they can even help you find yourself (if you get lost). Consumers are hooked on their phones and, surveys say, miss them long before realising their wallet has gone astray. They have become a life and death matter for manufacturers too \u2013 as Nokia, BlackBerry's Canadian owner Research in Motion and now Taiwan's HTC have found to their cost. The wrong smartphone, marketed in the wrong way, can destroy a company's market value in a matter of months. When Stephen Elop took over as chief executive of Nokia in 2010, the Finnish company was the world's largest maker of smartphones, with a global market share comfortably over 30%. A year later, and that share had halved, according to research firm IDC. In the ensuing nine months, the same thing would happen again and Nokia's share now stands at 7%. Asset sales, factory closures and job losses in their tens of thousands have followed. The decline has been just as startling at the once-mighty BlackBerry. Having created the ultimate email machine, RIM has been unable to follow up with a phone that lets you surf the internet without making you feel suicidal, and is now facing an existential crisis. In the space of a year, the company has gone from a quarterly profit measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars to a quarterly loss of the same magnitude; 7,000 jobs have already been axed this year. It seems a company can go out of fashion faster than its phone \u2013 as the experience of Taiwanese prodigy HTC, which has unravelled in just six months \u2013 has shown us. A relative newcomer to the consumer electronics business, it first found success making white-label Windows phones for various mobile networks. Then along came Google and the Android platform and HTC jumped aboard, making phones under its own name. Android's magic carpet whisked HTC into the stratosphere. Revenues doubled, peaking at Christmas 2011. Then, all of a sudden, the rug was pulled out from under its feet. HTC's newest handset, the HTC One X, failed to make an impression this spring and now sales and profits are in freefall: a company that was worth more than \u00a311bn in March is now valued at just over \u00a34bn. In an attempt to right the ship, HTC has sold back its stake in Dr Dre's hip headphone business after the combination of its phones and Dre's \"cans\" failed to inject street cred into the brand. The Seoul and Brazil offices have been closed, as has its research centre in North Carolina. HTC is still profitable, and may well bounce back. But history suggests that once they find themselves in a tailspin, phone makers rarely recover. Siemens, once a top-five manufacturer, began to loose its appeal in 2001. In two years its market share halved. By 2005 it had halved again, and the handset division was sold to a Chinese company. The decline of Motorola, once world number one, can be dated from 2007, the year the iPhone arrived. It took 18 months for half of Motorola's sales to fall away, and another 18 for it to loose its mojo altogether. The handset business was sold to Google last year. If anything, the pace of decline is increasing. Apple turned the mobile phone into a status symbol on a par with the designer handbag. As customers moved upmarket, two premium brands, Apple itself and Samsung, have taken control of more than half of worldwide sales. Mobile phones, like fashion, are looking like a dangerously fickle business. Walker can ride reforming tide The attraction of Sir David Walker, next chairman of Barclays, is that he stands for something. Try his comment to this newspaper: \"This is quite a good time to be reforming pay because of where the market in pay is. We may still suffer some breakages [employees leaving] but if people are only doing it for the money, they are probably not the people we need.\" It is impossible to imagine Walker's predecessor Marcus Agius expressing the view that you can't make an omelette without smashing eggs. Agius was happy to accept that pay would eventually fall across the industry \"to adjust to the new reality of higher capital and lower returns\", as he put it at this year's annual meeting. But the notion that Barclays should take a lead in this made him bristle. Shareholders' interests had to be protected, you see, and outsiders should be more patient. Walker's premise is that there's no time like the present. Hurrah! But the fine words have to be matched by deeds. The test will come when Barclays does suffer \"breakages\". What if a team of red-hot currency dealers threatens to move to, say, JP Morgan? Let 'em go \u2013 we'll find cheaper replacements, seems to be Walker's line. The good news is that he can expect shareholders to be supportive. During Bob Diamond's reign, most became sick of seeing the investment bankers protect their own rewards even when profits fell and returns were weak. Most are willing to gamble that the bank won't fall apart if a few supposed superstars jump ship. Walker's great advantage is that Diamond has gone. He can appoint his own chief executive and demand quick improvements. He is also helped by the Libor scandal: even on the trading floor, they recognise that Bonus Bob's downfall means life will now change. Just don't expect Walker to work miracles. His 2009 review of financial institutions had very little to say on the subject of banks' behaviour towards customers. There were excellent recommendations on the need for non-execs to get up to speed on risk and challenge executives. But since then the full horrors of the PPI insurance mis-selling scandal have been revealed and we've learned that small businesses were stuffed with interest-rate swaps they didn't need. With banks, there's always a new problem. Oil hunters in troubled waters of Falklands While oil companies are rightly pilloried over the environmental risks they take, you have to admire their bravado. After badly blundering in the Gulf of Mexico, it's hard not to admire BP's boldness as it set about trying to sign a deal with Rosneft behind the back of its existing (and already highly truculent) local partners, AAR. Similarly, it's fun to watch Premier Oil take a \u00a3640m bet on the Falklands, a drilling location Argentina has in the past been willing to start a war over. Premier Oil you might recall was one of the very few companies that hung on in Burma when it was exceedingly politically incorrect to do so. The management eventually sold out \u2013 and how frustrated they must be now that the gas-rich nation has been embraced again by the international community. The City has woken up to the Falklands being a difficult political destination, with Numis Securities last week changing its rating on the shares from buy to hold. But the good news for Simon Lockett and his team at Premier is that last week Noble Energy, became the first US firm to sign its own exploration deal in the disputed waters. Britain might no longer have the hardware to launch another liberation armada, but you can bet the US navy would defend its noble drillers if anything nasty kicked off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
