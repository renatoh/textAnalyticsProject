In a statement, the international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, said she had made a set of demands in light of the sexual exploitation scandal in Haiti and had received a formal response from Oxfam agreeing to them. She said that the government \u201creserves the right to take whatever decisions about present or future funding to Oxfam, and any other organisation, that we deem necessary\u201d. The news comes as the head of Oxfam International, Winnie Byanyima, announced a wide-ranging reform plan \u2013 including an independent commission to review Oxfam\u2019s culture and practices \u2013 and warned that what happened in Haiti \u201cis a stain on Oxfam that will shame us for years\u201d. The charity, which received \u00a331.7m in taxpayer funding in 2016/17, also announced that it would publish a 2011 internal investigation into staff involved in sexual and other misconduct in Haiti as soon as possible. In the statement sent out on Friday afternoon, Mordaunt said she had demanded that Oxfam make clear how it would handle any forthcoming allegations around safeguarding, whether they be historic or live, that they report staff members involved in incidents to their respective national governments, and that they fully cooperate with the Haitian authorities, including handing over all evidence they hold. She said that Oxfam had confirmed that it had complied with all these points. She added: \u201cFollowing our discussions, Oxfam has agreed to withdraw from bidding for any new UK government funding until DfID is satisfied that they can meet the high standards we expect of our partners. \u201cMy priority is to deliver for the world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable, while keeping people safe from harm. We want to ensure that programmes we are already financially committed to are being delivered appropriately by Oxfam or any other DfID partner.\u201d She said she was aware there were hundreds of \u201cgood, brave and compassionate\u201d people working for Oxfam around the world who had also been poorly served by Oxfam\u2019s leadership team. She added that Oxfam had a long way to go to regain the trust of the British public. In an interview with the Guardian, Mark Goldring, the chief executive of Oxfam GB, claimed criticism of the charity was \u201cout of proportion to the level of culpability\u201d and that critics were \u201cgunning\u201d for them while suggesting that no one had \u201cmurdered babies in their cots\u201d. He said that the revelations could have a \u201csubstantial effect on public confidence, which would affect public donations\u201d. More than 1,000 direct debits to the charity were cancelled over the weekend and several high-profile ambassadors, including Minnie Driver, withdrew their support for the charity. Not everyone has disowned the charity, however. Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis echoed her father\u2019s comments earlier in the week and said the festival would stand by the organisation \u201cfor many more years to come\u201d. \u201cSo we would like to pledge our continued support for Oxfam and the brave and vital work which it undertakes,\u201d she said. \u201cOxfam do outstanding work all over the world and we firmly believe that the good does still far outweigh the appalling behaviour of the few whose actions have caused such harm.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
