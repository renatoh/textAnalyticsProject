Tourists could travel like locals, while locals could cash in on their desirable neighbourhood properties by letting those visitors in. Last year the company was estimated to be worth more than US$30bn. It is scheduled to go public in 2020. Then came the Covid-19 pandemic. Travel is suspended. Australians are almost entirely confined to their homes. Now the once heralded disruptor is seeing a collapse in bookings. The hosts who have become reliant on income-generating properties to pay their bills are being bled dry by a lack of business, and already-suspicious neighbours are up in arms over the potential that short-term renters may spread the virus. In the decade before the pandemic, Airbnb became \u201cthis very attractive thing\u201d, says Chris Martin, a senior research fellow at the University of New South Wales\u2019s City Futures Research Centre. The platform, and others like it, fundamentally changed not only the travel industry but housing and rental markets. A home is no longer just a home, Martin says. \u201c[The company] tapped into the idea that a person\u2019s house can also be viewed as an asset that has capacity for generating income.\u201d This shift \u201cmassively upped the scale of [short-term rental]\u201d, which in turn put pressure on residential rental markets. The changes have resulted in lawsuits in the US and a petition by 10 cities to the European parliament in 2019. There are more than seven million Airbnb listings spread across 100,000 cities \u2013 with an estimated 346,581 listings between July 2016 and February 2019 in Australia alone. \u2018The whole industry has fallen through\u2019 Stephen Colman, who was an Airbnb host and ran an Airbnb management business up until last year, says \u201cthe whole industry has fallen through\u201d. Many hosts are either pulling out of Airbnb to find cheaper long-term tenants or have been offering \u201c14-day isolation suites\u201d. The former, Colman says, will come with a long wait and big rent cuts, as everyone else rushes to do the same. The latter is even more fraught. This week the Greens state MP for Ballina, Tamara Smith, called on online holiday booking websites such as Airbnb and Stayz in the Byron Bay region to stop marketing regional properties as ideal places for self-isolation, saying it wasn\u2019t fair on regional hospitals and communities. \u201cThere are real concerns around cleaning stuff,\u201d Colman says, \u201cHow many hours between checkout and check-in \u2026 [Hosts] have seen a fightback from body corporates who are just outright cancelling the key fobs for anyone who they believe is doing Airbnb. They\u2019ve just gone \u2018we\u2019re going to take this hard line to protect the safety of our long-term tenants\u2019.\u201d Jane Hearn, deputy chair of the Owners Corporation Network, has argued that opening Airbnb properties for quarantine \u201cincreases the viral load on apartment owners and tenants\u201d. Resident advocacy groups such as We Live Here and Neighbours Not Strangers were already lobbying against Airbnb on behalf of local communities who were sick of rowdy travellers in their apartment complexes. In a letter to New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian on 1 April, Neighbours Not Strangers called for an immediate ban on all short-term rentals, due to the risks from Covid-19. Airbnb does not support reservation requests from users who are showing symptoms, or those who are awaiting test results. Last week the company instituted a ban on any listings that \u201creference Covid-19, coronavirus or quarantine\u201d and listings which \u201cincentivise bookings through Covid-19-related discounts, stocks of limited resources, or the highlighting of quarantine-friendly listing attributes\u201d. The company\u2019s updated instructions for cleaning and hygiene recommend hosts stock their properties with \u201ca few extras\u201d like \u201cantibacterial hand sanitizer, disposable gloves and wipes, hand soap, paper towels, tissues\u201d \u2026 and toilet paper. The government has now mandated that all international arrivals must complete their quarantine at designated pre-booked hotels. But, before that, some Australians were happy turning to Airbnb. Comedian Alice Fraser is currently in a \u201cgood value\u201d Bondi Airbnb after returning from London. She saw Airbnb as \u201cthe responsible option\u201d: \u201c[It\u2019s there] for people who don\u2019t have favours to call in, or family who happen to have a massive home that can be segmented into parts.\u201d \u2018We lost everything\u2019 Lisa Porgazian and her husband have listed their three Gold Coast apartments on Airbnb for the past four years. Now the properties are empty, and the mortgage payments will come out of the couple\u2019s superannuation. \u201cWe were relying on this for our income, as well as our retirement plan,\u201d she says, distraught. \u201cNow that\u2019s completely died in the arse.\u201d Porgazian, a 46-year-old former IT contractor, has been managing her property portfolio full-time. She\u2019s unable to work in many other jobs due to rheumatoid arthritis. \u201cI\u2019m earning zero. My husband\u2019s earning zero. And we\u2019ve still got these mortgages to pay.\u201d With the spread of Covid-19, a downturn in business was inevitable. But many Airbnb hosts were shocked at how quickly it came. The company introduced a policy earlier this month allowing all guests who booked prior to 14 March (and were checking in no later than 31 May) to cancel existing bookings for free. Porgazian says this left hosts holding the cheque. \u201cWe lost everything straight away \u2026 Everything is cancelled, basically until Christmas.\u201d Susan Wheeldon, Airbnb\u2019s country manager for Australia and New Zealand, said offering these free cancellations \u201cwasn\u2019t an easy decision\u201d, but it was one made with \u201cpublic health considerations\u201d front of mind. \u201cThe primary consideration for us was protecting the wellbeing of the community.\u201d \u2018There\u2019s not enough tenants to fill these places\u2019 Travis Lipshus, a real estate agent in Byron Bay, thinks this chaos for Airbnb hosts could result in cheaper long-term rent for locals. He\u2019s getting flooded with properties from Airbnb hosts who now need permanent tenants. But with so many of the town\u2019s hospitality staff and backpackers currently out of work \u201cthere\u2019s not enough tenants to fill these places\u201d. If rents did lower, it would be a massive relief. It\u2019s notoriously difficult for locals to find affordable rentals in Byron Bay, as 17.6% of properties are listed as holiday accommodation. \u201cAirbnb should be banned up here,\u201d Lipshus says. \u201cThe cost of living is insane. I\u2019ve lived in all sorts of places here, and it\u2019s not uncommon to pay at least 50% of your wage in rent.\u201d Martin describes the current regulation around Airbnb as \u201creally quite liberal\u201d. He says at present, it \u201cdidn\u2019t seem to fit well with highly local impacts. Local councils [should] have a strategy and a plan around short-term letting \u2013 especially around limits.\u201d For now, he is not so certain we\u2019ll see a drop in rents. \u201cLandlords may still withhold properties and leave them vacant instead,\u201d he says. \u201cFor whatever reason, that seems to be a surprisingly common scenario in the high-pressure [locations].\u201d Wheeldon says that Airbnb \u201chas not seen a material drop in the overall number of listings on our platform. While the Covid-19 crisis has significantly disrupted the tourism industry and wider economy, we know that travel is resilient in the long term and will ultimately recover.\u201d But will the hosts recover? \u201cWe know our hosts are doing it tough,\u201d Wheeldon says. The peak body representing Airbnb and other short term rental companies has sought urgent support from the federal government for hosts in the form of mortgage payment deferrals, among other measures. For many, that may not be enough. \u201cA lot of people have over-leveraged themselves with these properties,\u201d Lipshus says. \u201cThe upper-middle class are probably going to be fine. But the middle class \u2013 the ones taking risks, trying to get up that class ladder \u2013 they\u2019re going to be pretty fucked.\u201d Lisa Porgazian knows what people are saying. \u201cThe criticism that we\u2019re getting is \u2018well you shouldn\u2019t have a business if you can\u2019t pay for it\u2019, but who ever predicted something like this?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
