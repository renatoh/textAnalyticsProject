Alok also delves into the art of the science documentary. The Wellcome Trust Broadcast Awards were announced recently at the Sheffield documentary film festival. We meet Julia Barron, one of the science documentary makers who won funding, and scientist Ian Roberts, who the Wellcome Trust invited to learn about the skill of pitching a science documentary. Observer science and technology editor Robin McKie and Guardian science correspondent Ian Sample join Alok to discuss some of this week's big science stories including controversial reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on the subject of geo-engineering solutions for climate change and why a recent census is bad news for our native ladybirds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
