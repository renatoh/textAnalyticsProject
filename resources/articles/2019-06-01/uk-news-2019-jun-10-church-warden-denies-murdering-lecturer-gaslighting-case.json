Benjamin Field, 28, has admitted poisoning, gaslighting and defrauding 69-year-old Peter Farquhar, a university lecturer and novelist, in order to get a better job and inherit his wealth when he died. He told the court he had also deceived Ann Moore-Martin, an 83-year-old retired headteacher, saying: \u201cI was pretending to have a real relationship with her that was false.\u201d Field was giving evidence for the first time in his trial, where he is accused of murdering Farquhar and conspiring to murder Moore-Martin after a sustained campaign of gaslighting, a form of psychological manipulation that can make a person question their sanity. Field is on trial alongside Martyn Smith, a 32-year-old magician, who is also accused of murdering Farquhar and planning to kill Moore-Martin. Field\u2019s younger brother, Tom, a 24-year-old Cambridge University graduate, is accused of a single charge of fraud. Field told Oxford crown court he deceived Farquhar into thinking they were in a \u201cgenuine and caring relationship\u201d, administered drugs covertly and gaslighted him over a period of about six months. \u201c[I was] moving things, so that he didn\u2019t find them, to irritate. I did it vindictively and did it to confuse him,\u201d Field said. He told the court that his manipulation of Moore-Martin was \u201cvery similar\u201d to that of Farquhar and lasted nearly two years. Farquhar, from the village of Maids Moreton in Buckinghamshire, died in October 2015. Moore-Martin, who lived a few doors away, died in May 2017. David Jeremy QC, defending Field, asked his client if he had suffocated Peter Farquhar, or intended to kill him, to which Field replied: \u201cI did not.\u201d Jeremy then asked if he had conspired to murder or attempted to murder Moore-Martin, and whether he had given her drugs or tried to poison her, or encouraged or assisted her to commit suicide. \u201cI did not. Never,\u201d Field said. Field told the court he started a relationship with Farquhar to \u201cexploit his vanity and desire for companionship\u201d. Field took notes of how he deceived Farquhar and the drugs he administered. When asked why, he said: \u201cAfter I moved in with Peter, there wasn\u2019t anyone close to me left that I wasn\u2019t deceiving in a huge way. \u201cI kept my records of my manoeuvres, a map of this territory of deception that I\u2019m making of myself, to have an account of what really happened.\u201d Field has admitted lying to Moore-Martin that his brother desperately needed a dialysis machine, convincing her to give him more than \u00a327,000. When asked what he did with the money, he said: \u201cI certainly didn\u2019t buy a dialysis machine, I kept it and spent it.\u201d Field told the court he had also burgled two elderly people\u2019s homes, stealing a bottle of Drambuie and rifles. \u201cI don\u2019t have a very good reason for it,\u201d he told the jury, adding he was driven by a \u201cdisrespectful, reckless\u201d curiosity. \u201cBecause I could, I think is the ultimate reason.\u201d He also admitted taking one line of cocaine in 2010 and later taking benzodiazepines to help him sleep during 2014-15. He said he had been cautioned by police in 2011 for shoplifting T-shirts. Field said he was heterosexual but had been paid between \u00a330 and \u00a350 for receiving oral sex from men he met through the website Craigslist when he was 20 years old. Field described his relationship with Farquhar as \u201cquite mixed\u201d, saying he had \u201ca great deal of affection for him as a friend\u201d, and found him to be \u201ca fascinating man\u201d. However, he said he found \u201caspects of him dislikable\u201d. In an email he had written to himself, he labelled his relationship with Farquhar as \u201cvulgarly commercial\u201d. When asked by Jeremy if there was any relationship in which he had not been deceptive, Field replied: \u201cIf there is I can\u2019t think of it.\u201d The trial continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
