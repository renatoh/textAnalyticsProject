Anthony Hopkins \u2013 in full reptilian ham mode, doing the quiet sonorous voice and musing smile as if tactfully suppressing entirely justified triumph at how much wiser he is than everyone else \u2013 plays John Clancy, a troubled psychic who used to help the FBI with murder cases and is now tempted out of retirement. Colin Farrell, low of brow, dilated of pupil, plays the murderous wacko repeat offender who has something crucial in common with his pursuer, and Abbie Cornish is the young officer who regards Hopkins with the same sort of awe that Jodie Foster managed in The Silence of the Lambs so many years ago. It\u2019s almost exotically ridiculous. Hopkins\u2019s longtime FBI colleague, played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, keeps sentimentally telling the old boy what a lovely smile he has. Actually, that bizarrely menacing rictus is just another reminder of Dr Lecter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
