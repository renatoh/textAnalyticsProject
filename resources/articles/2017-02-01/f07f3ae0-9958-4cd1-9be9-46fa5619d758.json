Inevitably, as he addressed the media before the WGC-Mexico Championship, deepest intrigue surrounded that McIlroy golf match with Donald Trump. McIlroy, who defended himself in a strongly worded statement on Friday, admitted surprise at the level of negative reaction to his acceptance of an invitation from the US president. He made a point of apologising to anyone who took umbrage. And yet, in what characterises the Northern Irishman to such an extent, he appears perfectly at ease with joining Trump on 19 February in Florida. \u201cI guess I just approached it, as I said in my statement, as a round of golf,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cAnyone\u2019s beliefs or politics or whatever, just put that to one side for a minute. To go there and see 30 secret service and 30 cops and snipers in the trees, it\u2019s just \u2013 I mean, it was just a surreal experience for me to see something like that. That was part of the reason I wanted to go and play. \u201cIf it had been Obama I would have gone to play. I\u2019ve played golf with President Clinton, I\u2019ve spent time with President Bush. I\u2019ve been around quite a few presidents before and again, like putting beliefs and whatever to one side, I just wanted to have an experience that I might not ever get [again]; play golf with a sitting president. \u201cYou can respect the guy, not respect the guy, I don\u2019t care, but if someone has a chance to play in that scenario and just sort of experience the whole thing ... it\u2019s not as if we were speaking foreign policy out there. We were talking about golf and the grass that he put on the greens and the grass that he\u2019s putting on the greens at [Trump-owned] Doral. We talked golf the entire day. I think he was happier to talk golf than anything else that he has to do these days. \u201cI\u2019m not an American. I can\u2019t change the way the political system or what\u2019s going to happen. I can\u2019t vote.\u201d McIlroy added: \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I pissed people off but I felt I was in a position where I couldn\u2019t really do anything but say \u2018yes\u2019. Respect the office even if you don\u2019t respect the guy that\u2019s in it, go play and go from there. I actually enjoyed myself, I had a good time. \u201cYes I was a little bit taken aback by the blow back I received but I get why. It\u2019s a tough place to be in, it\u2019s a tough position, and maybe if I look back on it I put myself in a position where I was going to get that from either side one way or the other. I was just doing what I felt was respectful and the president of the United States phones you up and wants to play golf with you.\u201d McIlroy\u2019s political awareness stems from an upbringing on the outskirts of Belfast. He swatted aside any notion of comparison between home and the US. \u201cI feel like my generation has moved past all of that,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel with the Good Friday agreement and the peace process people have become way closer together.\u201d McIlroy\u2019s working back to fitness \u2013 he missed four tournaments from mid January \u2013 included a bounce game with Dustin Johnson on Saturday. \u201cI shot 65,\u201d said McIlroy, who could return to the summit of the world rankings with a win in Mexico. \u201cWe were joking; it was quite a week for me, I got to play with the president of the United States and the best golfer in the world.\u201d There was also a recent McIlroy social meeting with Tiger Woods, whose status remains unknown as he encounters back spasms. \u201cI had lunch with him last week and we had a great time,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cJust the two of us sat down. I think the good thing is he\u2019s in a good place. He\u2019s got other things in his life that he\u2019s interested in and it\u2019s not as if it\u2019s just golf. He\u2019s got other things and that\u2019s great. He struggled with his body over the past couple years and it\u2019s unfortunate because it just won\u2019t allow him to do what he wants to do. \u201cHowever long it is that it takes him to be healthy enough to get out here and play, even if he plays eight to 10 times a year, that\u2019s a bonus for all of us.\u201d Here altitude will provide a stern test; the Club de Chapultepec lies more than 7,500ft above sea level. \u201cJudging distances is going to be really tough,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cI was hitting eight irons today 210 yards. It\u2019s so hard to get used to and trust in your mind that that club is going to hit the ball that far.\u201d With that we were back to McIlroy\u2019s bread and butter. He would understandably prefer it to remain that way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
