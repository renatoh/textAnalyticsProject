The number of spots available for federally approved in-home childcare is capped at 5,600. These are largely targeted at families with extra needs, such as those with sick or disabled children or parents who themselves are sick or disabled. In some cases, in-home care can be accessed by shift workers and families in rural and regional centres. The cost of the program is 0.5% of the overall childcare budget. The president of the Australian Home Childcare Association, David Wilson, is pushing for an increase in the capped places to 10,000 a year for four years. He said the proposed changes would have a tangible impact on the number of parents who returned to work after having children. \u201cI\u2019m looking at the people who have to work, need to work but can\u2019t access childcare,\u201d Wilson said. \u201c[The places] would really be targeted at people who can\u2019t access traditional childcare.\u201d Wilson said people who worked outside standard nine-to-five hours, such as police officers and ambulance drivers, would have the most to gain. \u201cIt\u2019s the shift workers who are missing out,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no long daycare centres that suit their needs because they work overnight and on the weekends.\u201d The association has done modelling to show that increasing the capped places for in-home childcare to 40,000 would cost the government $6.2m over four years. That amounts to less than 0.3% of the childcare budget. Wilson said the government would \u201calmost be derelict in their duties to the Australian people\u201d if it did not consider the proposal, which he said would amount to an \u201cinsignificant\u201d cost to the budget bottom line. The independent senator Nick Xenophon has spoken in the Senate in support of uncapping the number of places available for in-home care, saying it would be a \u201csensible move towards providing more flexible care options for modern, working families\u201d. The social services minister, Scott Morrison, is expected to unveil the government\u2019s families package before the May budget. He has indicated he will take on the recommendations of the Productivity Commission\u2019s report into childcare. The report recommends that the in-home category of childcare be abolished once subsidies for nannies are introduced. But Wilson warned that creating national training and quality standards for nannies would take time and money, whereas the infrastructure and expertise to expand in-home care already existed. The federal government spends $7bn a year on childcare. If adopted in their entirety, the Productivity Commission\u2019s recommendations would result in an increase of 1.2% in the workplace participation rate for mothers, equivalent to getting 16,400 more women into work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
