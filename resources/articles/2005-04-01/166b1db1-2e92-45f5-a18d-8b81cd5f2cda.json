The prime minister, the chancellor, Gordon Brown, and the trade secretary, Patricia Hewitt, have insisted that the so-called Phoenix Four make a significant personal contribution to a \u00a3100m-plus line of credit to keep the company going while Whitehall-brokered negotiations continue with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation. Ms Hewitt yesterday dispatched a team of senior officials from the DTI to Shanghai for a weekend of meetings to speed up progress in the joint venture talks. Sources in Whitehall said ministers had lost patience with the \"snail's pace\" of the talks. Mr Blair, Mr Brown and Ms Hewitt blame Rover for the impasse and believe 6,000 jobs at Rover and thousands more in the West Midlands have been put at risk by the British carmaker's failure until recently to reveal the full scale of its financial liabilities. The government has demanded that Rover's directors, who have taken \u00a340m out of the loss-making company, should share the financial risk involved in the bridging loan. Ministers are concerned that the new cash could never be repaid if the collapse of the deal forced Rover into administration. They have concluded that it would be ridiculous for the government to let Rover keel over at such a late stage in the talks, but have made it clear that the taxpayers' money on offer will have to be paid back if the joint venture goes ahead. Ministers are already seeking possible buyers should the Chinese walk away, but admit that the prospect of finding a new suitor is remote. Mr Blair and his senior colleagues believe the impact for the local community would be \"devastating\" if the Chinese abandoned the deal, and there will be significant job losses even if the joint venture goes ahead. A contingency plan involving the government and Birmingham city council is already being prepared. \"Throughout this process the government has done all it can to help support the joint venture and SAIC,\" one Whitehall source said last night. \"This is, however, a crucial deal between two companies and even with the offer of a bridging loan its success is not guaranteed. We can, however, guarantee that should this joint venture fail the government will provide immediate support and financial assistance to the workers, their families and the communities affected.\" Agreement is understood to have been reached on the terms of the deal which would see SAIC take 75% of joint ventures in both Britain and China. Phoenix Venture Holdings, Rover's parent company, would own the remaining 25%. The central unresolved issue is satisfying the Chinese that Phoenix has the financial strength to fund its share of liabilities both now and in the future. Central to these concerns are pension fund liabilities and the long-term costs of reducing the 6,100-strong Longbridge workforce by between 2,000 and 2,500. The government's role is seen as that of a \"big brother\" to Phoenix, giving SAIC a degree of reassurance about the level of risk it is taking on. \"The government is constrained in what it can do but we are talking about 6,000-plus jobs directly and double that number indirectly,\" one source said last night. The deal is crucial to Rover's future. The firm is losing money and without investment is unable to develop new models. Last year production at the Longbridge plant fell to around 106,000 cars. SAIC, which already has joint ventures in China with General Motors and Volkswagen, needs a deal to give it ownership of the intellectual property rights that would come through a tie-up with MG Rover. Without that ownership it will not be able to develop and exploit the technology which would allow it to build cars suitable for export. Yesterday Rover and SAIC declined to comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
