When you're in a job, they are constantly calling with job offers you don't want; when you're looking, they tell you things are a bit quiet. And if you're a temp, they either never return your calls or bombard you with jobs you'd never consider. \u00b7 In fact, it's hard to find anyone with a good word for recruitment consultants - including, according to a Perriam &amp; Everett survey, recruiters themselves. Apparently 40% of consultants are dissatisfied with interview processes, 35% feel that their current role and firm were not accurately described and 33% are dissatisfied with their level of training. Whatever next? \u00b7 Of course, getting a new job is really all about the interview. I thought most of us had got the basics by now: wear a suit, research the company, don't lie and don't badmouth your old boss. How hard can it be? Research conducted by Theladders.co.uk suggests it's very hard indeed. Gaffes reported included wearing a boob tube, lying about speaking another language, insulting the interviewer, and my favourite, acting desperate. Though actually, thinking about the behaviour of some of The Apprentice candidates, desperation - or even begging - can work. Yes, Michael Sophocles, we're thinking about you. \u00b7 On the other hand, I wonder why we all bother. Frankly, the need to keep a roof over my head seems trivial when I consider the horror of actually going to work. Then there's the fact that some employers, pondering how to keep the workforce motivated, have concluded that the best thing to do is make us all re-apply for our own jobs. Sigh. A company called Hudson has found that one in four of us would never reapply for our current job. No surprises there. But human nature will out. Although 66% of us reckon a formal process would make us more stressed (whodathunkit?), 42% of us say that the upside would be that lazier colleagues would be found out. In other words, we're prepared to be completely hysterical with fear that we might lose our own jobs just to show David in marketing not to be so uppity. Honestly. \u00b7 Not that it matters. Come 2030 it might not be safe to go to work anyway. A report into global office trends from Johnson Controls reckons the future holds three very different types of workplaces: the Hive (a home office brought about by climate change) the Eco-office (a kind of champagne socialist heaven brought about by climate change and social progress) and Gattaca (a sweatshop brought about by climate change and the 42% of us who reckon our colleagues are lazier than us). Sadly, the report declines to say what will happen to the recruiters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
