As a plethora of hostile editorials and articles in the European press attest, the sight of a politician widely derided as a \u201cmini Trump\u201d becoming the new British prime minister has only confirmed the impression that the UK has been consumed by a populist revolution symbolised by the vote for Brexit. At one level this \u201cnoise\u201d is more than superficial, since it points to a fundamental problem with the Johnson candidacy for Europe, which is the baggage he brings as a high-profile character who made a career out of lampooning the ideals, initiatives and institutions of the European Union. There is no doubt that Johnson\u2019s record as both newspaper columnist and foreign minister will make it harder for Europe to justify making concessions to him that leaders were not prepared to make for Theresa May. Come the October European Council, there will be voices arguing that any concession to Johnson is a concession to \u201cpopulism\u201d, and should be avoided. At the same time, Johnson\u2019s early lead has so far avoided the worst fears in EU capitals that the leadership race would create a rhetorical \u201crace to the bottom\u201d in which candidates out-bid each other to win over the hard Brexit caucus. With Esther McVey out, Michael Gove weakened by the drug-taking scandal and Dominic Raab isolated as too extreme among his fellow candidates over his willingness to shut down parliament, Johnson has only had to remain silent to gain ground. This has had the effect of reducing the temperature of the contest which looked to be off to a very heated start when Johnson announced his campaign by promising to withhold the Brexit bill if Europe would not give him \u201cclarity\u201d on the future relationship. This would be both illegal and politically counterproductive as the strong pushback from Europe has made clear. All that said, the European Union and EU capitals also know that Prime Minister Johnson \u2013 for all his baggage \u2013 has the potential to deliver a Brexit deal where May has repeatedly failed. After three lost meaningful votes, Europe knows that a remainer of May\u2019s ilk is very unlikely to be able to deliver the Brexit deal in parliament, even after the political declaration on the future relationship has been tweaked in a more Brexiteer direction. For that reason, Brussels and the EU capitals are clear that Johnson will be given a hearing, if and when he enters No 10. The question in European minds is whether Johnson \u2013 or any Brexiteer prime minister \u2013 can inject enough realism into their fellow Brexiteers to clinch such a deal. The Tory party conference at the end of September will be a key moment for assessing whether that prime minister can walk the line between promising the \u201cliberation\u201d of Brexit while sticking to what is deliverable in Brussels. May failed that test. The fear is that Johnson will do so again. Europe will do what it can to try to refresh the deal \u2013 focusing heavily on amending the political declaration and the hunt for \u201calternative arrangements\u201d on the Irish border, which May promised but Brexiteers never trusted her to deliver. Talk of a \u201ctime limit\u201d to the Irish backstop is probably a step too far. Could Europe really give Johnson what they denied May? But if Johnson rewrote the declaration to commit the UK to a free trade agreement rather than a customs union and won additional promises that the backstop would not be needed, there is a glimmer of hope in Europe that, with the threat of a disastrous general election looming, the rebellious Tory back benches who defied May might yet fall into line for Johnson. All concerned know that this is still a long shot, but at the very least they are determined to try, since if the fleeting chance at renegotiation goes wrong, Europe will still not want to be blamed for triggering a no deal. And yet, if it comes to it, the willingness of the EU27 to accept a no deal has risen appreciably since their last gathering in April. Within very strict limits, the EU will try to help Johnson get a repackaged deal over the line. And while there\u2019s some optimism he will be able to do what May could not, two long years of failed Brexit negotiations mean they know better than to get their hopes up. \u2022 Mujtaba Rahman is the managing director of Europe at Eurasia Group, a political risk research and consulting firm"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
