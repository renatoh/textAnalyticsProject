Luke Donald, Phil Mickelson and Ernie Els are all at -1, and Rory McIlroy is far from out of it at level par, though he'll have to up his game on the greens if he fancies swanning around in a Green Jacket come Sunday evening. Anyway, three days still to go. You'll come and join us tomorrow, yes? Glad that's agreed! See you then! Sweet dreams! Kuchar fails to hit his birdie effort from 18 feet. That's probably the poorest putt he's hit all afternoon. He knocks in the three footer he leaves himself, and that'll be his signature at the bottom of a 68. He's one of only 12 players to shoot below 70, and has earned his place at the top of a leaderboard few would have predicted at sunrise this morning. Let's take one last look before bedtime, patrons... Kuchar clips his second to 18 pin high, out on the right. He doesn't seem too happy with it mid-flight, but what a fussy bugger. He'll have a chance for a birdie that'd give him fuel for tomorrow morning, when these final groups are sent out early doors. \"I have to say that I find it surprising how many people tipped McIlroy to win the Green Jacket this year given that he can't seem to hole three-footers,\" opines Cameron Yule. \"When even my favourite, Lee Westwood, and your beloved Sergio can make them, it really does show how poor Rory has been.\" Two putts for McIlroy, who has missed five putts from within six feet today. He signs for a level par 72, and doesn't look like a potential champion this week to me, he's dropping shots all over the place, and his intensity doesn't quite seem to be up there. Perhaps something will spark tomorrow, and he'll get his gameface on. I do hope so. Meanwhile a fantastic finish for Keegan Bradley, who whizzes an appalling drive into the trees on the right at 18, is forced to punch the ball out, then lifts his third to 15 feet, before teasing in a tricky right-to-left curler for par. He's still back at +1, but will probably be a lot happier than Rory, who threw away some good positions out there. Kuchar belts his drive straight down the middle at 18. Up the hole, McIlroy knocks his second pin high, and will have a chance to salvage something from a distinctly average day. Neither Kuchar nor Dufner play the 17th particularly well. Dufner bogeys, while Kuchar manages to get up and down from an awkward position at the front of the green; he remains at -4. McIlroy's not going to win this week. He's flinging shots away needlessly. After a booming drive down the middle of 17, he wedges into the centre of the green, then takes three putts, missing a tiddler for par. He's back to level par. Up on 18, Mickelson is faced with a 25 footer for birdie - and sees a magnificent effort skate by the hole on the right. He'll sign for a one-under 71, not great by any means, but given his position after seven holes - he was +2 and playing abysmally - that's not to be sniffed at. Not many players left out on the course now, so here's a lovely story from Billy Murphy on the travails of following Sergio around. \"I was there at Medinah, as he walked up the 18th. And we sang: 'Sergio, Sergio Sergio' to the tune of 'Here We Go, Here We Go, Here We Go'. He did not disappoint. Anyway, after it was all over, Sergio galloped over to our section and lofted his size whatevers our way. One of them, amid a throng of reaching arms and hands, pinged about a bit, and then hit or rather fell on the back of my head, before falling to the ground. I reached down to try and grab it, amidst the throng, but alas came up with an empty beer can. Afterwards, Sergio again galloped off, this time to champagne and television cameras. And I had this beer can. Still, I think its marginally better than a smelly shoe.\" Kuchar's playing partner, the somnambulant Jason Dufner, clips his tee shot at 16 to two feet, yawns, scratches his arse, and taps in for birdie. After additional birdies at 13 and 15 - sandwiching a bogey at 14 - he's suddenly -1. Matt Kuchar! Dear me, you wouldn't have expected this. After that tiny mistake on the 15th green, he's dumped his tee shot at 16 in the bunker at the back right, and fails to splash out. His third, mind you, is brilliant, an exquisite clip to two feet. He'll escape with a bogey four. If anything, that was another example of his equilibrium; his round was threatening to spin a little bit out of control there, but he took a deep breath, accepted what had gone before, and then dealt with the situation brilliantly. He's back to -4, mind. Mickelson can't save his par on 17. He only just makes it over the bunker at the front with his lob wedge, leaving himself 10 feet short of the hole. The putt doesn't drop. He's back to -1. Back on 16, McIlroy isn't far from draining a 30-footer up the green for birdie, but the ball dies to the left at the last, and a par will have to do. He's still at -1. He seems to have found a second wind, though; around the turn, and for a while after, he was wandering around with a coupon on. \"I lost it a little bit from 11.\" That's Sergio's analysis of his day's work. I'm not full of confidence for the rest of the week, I have to say. Mickelson has put his tee shot at 17 into Dustin Country, but manages to find a gap in the trees and hoick his second just in front of the green. A chance to save par, at least, because for a while it looked like there would be none. Meanwhile on 18, Dustin gets his second pin high, but fails to hit an 18-foot birdie putt, and has to settle for a five-under 67. That's not too bad at all. His playing partner Fred Couples finds sand with his approach, meanwhile, and can't get up and down, so he must make do with a card of 68. Back on 15, Kuchar makes a rare mistake, underhitting a birdie putt, the ball dying to the left from 12 feet. A chance spurned. Some good news for Rory! His second to 15 falls off the back of the green, just, but he manages to tease a birdie out of the situation. He's back to -1. \"Interesting comment comparing Sergio's collapse to come to that of Dustin's, as they are also dressed as twins today,\" notes Seamus Devlin. \"Well, three year old twins who are dressed identically by their mother and who both meltdown at about the same time due to the lack of a nap.\" In fairness, they played very nicely today. No meltdowns for the big man, and Sergio only threatened to smash his driver into a million tiny shards once. Back on 16, Mickelson sends his tee shot high on the right, about 12-15 feet from the flag. And then knocks in the putt. He's suddenly -2! This is some charge, four birdies in five holes! Hopefully it won't be his last preposterous birdie blitz of the week. Meanwhile back on 18, neither Scott nor Sergio leave their third shots dead, but they knock their par putts home. Scott signs for a three-under 69, Garcia for an amazing, bogey-free 66! Three more, please, Sergio! Sergio's got a route to the green, but he's got to dice with the big bunker on the right. He sends his approach over the flag, and just off the back of the green. Not ideal, but not terrible, and he's at least got a chance of getting up and down. His playing partner Adam Scott has very quietly tiptoed up the leaderboard, meanwhile, and comes up the last at -3. He's just off the back of the green too; it'll be interesting if either of them can do something spectacular here, or fail to get up and down. Anything might happen with these two. Matt Kuchar makes his short birdie putt on 14, and now look! -6 Leishman (F) Garcia (17) -5 Couples (17) D Johnson (17) Kuchar (14) -4 Lynn (F) Fowler (F) Fernandez-Castano (F) Immelman (F) Another birdie for Phil Mickelson, this time at 15. Rory should take notes; he's just been that little bit more tenacious in his refusal to bow down to a recalcitrant golf game. Meanwhile up on 17, Dustin can't make his missable par putt, and he drops back to -5. Which is where his playing partner Couples is, knocking his second to eight feet and rolling his birdie effort in! Leaderboard coming up! All-new leaderboard coming up! Rory is back to level par, prodding a very uncertain ten footer up the 14th green. He looks miserable, which is how you'd have to describe his form since the turn. My mistake with Johnson on 17; he doesn't have a bunker to circumvent, but he elects to lob the ball up anyway. And leaves it well short of the hole. The only player who looks in total control of his clubs and his emotions - and we're only on the first day! - is Matt Kuchar, who guides a lovely mid iron into the 14th, the ball biting on the back before spinning back to six feet. He'll have that to make a real mark on the leaderboard. Dustin really is faffing about. He belts his drive into filth down the right of 17, then fails to reach the green with his second, leaving himself one hell of an up and down over a bunker from distance, front left with the pin high on the right. And while we're on the subject of arsing around, here's a stat: Sergio Garcia's last bogey-free round at Augusta was the third round in 2002. He's one hole left. So what does he do? You've guessed it! He hits a tree with his drive. It's not quite as bad as it sounds, shaving some overhanging branches at the corner on the right, but he'll be left with quite a tester for his approach. Sergio is in the bunker at the front of 17. He throws the ball miles into the air, and it rolls round to the right and settles six feet from the cup. Another escape? Aye! And another fist pump as he plops his putt straight into the cup. This is very impressive golf. Speaking of which, there's another birdie at last for Kuchar, this time at 13. He's sashaying around in a very smooth manner. The winner come Sunday, I tell you this now. Dustin Johnson gets away with murder on 16. His tee shot isn't bad, finding the heart of the green, but the spin takes the ball down the hill to the left. He's got a long uphill putt - and clatters it idiotically 12 feet past the hole. That was simply ludicrous. But then from the ridiculous to the sublime, as he tickles the downhill par saver straight into the cup. He walks off the green with a daft grin spread all over his coupon. The message it gives off couldn't be any clearer if he was ambling to the next tee wearing a sandwich board bearing the slogan: I KNOW, I KNOW, I'M A LUDICROUS CLOWN. He's played stunning golf today, like he's done at so many majors. And yet something always seems to snap in his noggin at the wrong time. Hopefully that'll be a wee lesson, because he's a very likeable player and would make a popular winner of this tournament. Mickelson's been battling away after a dreadful start. Birdies at 12 and 13 have dragged him back to level par, and he's only a turn or two away from knocking a long birdie effort in on 14. Like McIlroy, he's not been on it at all, but he's far from out of the competition yet. Very much in the competition is Sergio, but he's put his drive at 17 onto a carpet of pine needles, and his attempt to find the green with a Ballesterosian escape doesn't come off. I knew I should have kept my yakking neck shut. More street fightin' efforts on display here, this time from McIlroy back on 13. He'd dropped two shots in three holes, so sending his approach back left of the green wasn't the ideal thing to do. But he bumped and ran a gorgeous chip to four feet, down the hill with the creek at the back. Wonderfully judged, and he gets his reward by knocking in the birdie putt. He's not been on his game at all, but that's a great up and down to move him back into red figures at -1. Rather magnificently, Sergio makes his par on 16, a staunch two putt from miles down the green. His first putt is wonderfully judged from distance, though it still leaves him with a tricky left-to-right tiddler down the hill. You've seen him miss these a thousand times, but he makes no mistake here, and walks off pumping his fist. He's got the bit between his teeth today. I don't want to tempt fate, but I've got to act like an adult and say it anyway: the way he's played the back nine so far, you'd expect the wheels to usually clank off. But he's dug in, played the percentages when he's had to, and this is his reward. Two holes to go. Can he keep on keeping on? Dustin Johnson Meltdown Time? Not yet, not yet. His drive at 15 goes behind some trees down the right, but he's got a route into the green, and he scoops a short iron straight over the flag and just off the back of the green. He's left with a tricky little up and down, but clips to a couple of feet. He's surely going to tie for the lead now. And he does, tapping in for his bird. Meanwhile perhaps the biggest cheer of the day comes on 18, where Tianlang Guan first betrays his age for the first time today - still a boy, really, he requires a fairway wood to get up the hill to the green with his second - but he finds the apron, and then rakes in a 25-footer, cool as you like, for birdie. The infinite blue rattles like nothing we've heard today. He's +1, a 73 round Augusta, in the Masters, as a 14 year old. My word. And he looks as though he doesn't give a flying one. He's going places, this lad. Sergio's really gone to town playing it safe on 16. You don't want to end up missing the green on the right, leaving an almost impossible downhill chip or putt, but he's sent his ball down to the back left-hand corner, where he'll have a long putt uphill. That's far from ideal, although not half as bad as the alternative. \"Look on the bright side,\" begins Steve Buist. \"The spine-crushing inevitability of Sergio\u2019s collapse will also be coupled with what will surely be the entertaining inevitability of Dustin Johnson Meltdown Time, which I believe you have trademarked. Start working on a new video animation to accompany it.\" Sergio taps his little left-to-right breaker down the 15th, into the cup, and he's picked up another birdie! He's -6, the co-leader of this tournament! This is all very surreal. \"Ahh the trials and tribulations of following Sergio in a major!\" writes Duncan Searle, who's arrived to calm us all down at exactly the right moment. \"A never empty bucket of hope, despite the fact he consistently tips it upside down right in front of you! One thing that I think will help him this week are his playing partners. He is good friends with Adam Scott and he has Angel Cabrera alongside him. Another friend that will help him relax as if he's playing a Saturday medal with his pals. The fact Cabrera has won the Masters will only benefit Garcia! I'm sure I read an article a year or two ago where Cabrera answered questions about Sergio's ability to win a major and he was full of praise and said he just had to believe in himself a bit more. Give him a pep talk Angel!\" The play's slowed up a wee bit here. Unless I've slipped into a trance, and let's not rule anything out. Matt Kuchar is only a roll or two from another birdie on 12. He's hardly been in trouble at all. It's surely only a matter of time before this guy wins a major. Speaking of... no, but Sergio has once again taken his medicine on a par five after a poor drive, and after laying up with his second, wedges his third nearly off the back of the green - but ten feet or so from the hole. He'll have another chance for birdie. \"If Sergio misses the cut (I know, but, you know, Sergio), can you continue to MBM him as if he were still playing?\" asks Gary Naylor. \"It'd be much better than the real thing.\" I may well give it a go, yes, especially if I slip into a state of denial. Then if it proves popular, and I haven't been put into sheltered housing, I may follow it up with Brazil 0-5 Scotland, the 2014 World Cup final. Scotland haven't already been knocked out of the World Cup, Scotland haven't already been knocked out of the World Cup, Scotland haven't already been knocked out of the World Cup, Scotland haven't already been knocked out of the World Cup, all work and no play makes Scotty a dull boy. Rory three-putts on 12, and he's back to level par. He needs to hold on here, because a decent score is beginning to go south. Garcia two putts 14 for his par, no disgrace from where he was positioned on a very fast green. He's pulled his drive at 15 down the left, and might not have a shot into the green. He's lost a wee bit of momentum since that three putt on 13, though nothing overly dramatic to worry about yet. Dustin Johnson has just blasted a monster over the trees and down the 13th, then hit a short iron into the heart of the green, before stroking home the eagle putt. Suddenly he's bothering the top end of the leaderboard. And his playing partner Freddie Couples isn't too shabby either, creaming his second into the heart of the green and two-putting for birdie. -6 Leishman (F) -5 Garcia (13) D Johnson (13) -4 Lynn (F) Fowler (F) Fernandez-Castano (F) Immelman (17) Couples (13) Fernandez-Castano drives into the Lyle Bunker up 18, then finds greenside sand with his second, and can't get up and down. It's a lame finish to a superlative round of 68. Back on 14, his fellow countryman Sergio hits his second pin high, leaving himself an outside chance of birdie. Meanwhile our 14-year-old hero Guan bogeyed 14, then parred 15; he's still at +2. Alongside him in the group, and on the leaderboard, is the superannuated Matteo Manassero, 19, who has responded to dropping shots at 12, 13 and 14 with an eagle from the back of 15. The 2008 champion Trevor Immelman - arguably the most boring Masters of all time, that one - fancies another Green Jacket, it would seem. He's just birdied 17, the third shot he's picked up in the last five holes, having made a couple at 13 and 14. He's -4 and right in the mix. Sergio meanwhile is beginning to drive like a madman, in the Seve style. He pulls his tee shot at 14 down the left, flirting with the trees, but just about gets away with it. \"You\u2019ll recall Einstein\u2019s famous quote that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result,\" begins Steve Buist, roadtesting some new material. \"What\u2019s less known is Einstein also invented a definition of golf insanity, described as 'cheering for Sergio over and over and expecting a different result'. You could look it up.\" No need. Sergio wasn't far from leaving his first putt 25 feet short, on top of a ridge. The ball just about toppled over the top of it, and rolled down to 12 feet or so. He's still putting downhill, and he pushes the effort to the right. Par. A three-putt par. I suppose he'll have taken that after the tee shot, but there's a missed opportunity. Meanwhile Kuchar was a joule or two of energy away from raking in a huge birdie effort on 10. He's going to take some beating this week, in my book. He may not go on ludicrous scoring sprees, but he just keeps chipping away. Damn, he's good. A dropped shot for Rory at 10, who dumped his long second shot into a bunker, and couldn't get up and down. He's back to -1, but that's still a fairly decent position, having played pretty poorly by his own ludicrously high standards. Meanwhile on 13, a stroke of luck for Sergio, whose sunny demeanour is bringing him some good fortune. His drive has clattered back out of the woods, and he's left with a long iron into the green. He grabs the opportunity with both hands, arrowing the ball straight into the heart of the green, and he'll have two putts, albeit from a fair old distance, for a share of the lead. Sergio isn't the only Spaniard ripping it up this afternoon. Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano has birdied 15 and 17, and he's now -5 with only the 18th to traverse. \"It's easy to forget just how drop dead gorgeous Fred Couples was 20 years ago,\" recalls Niall Mullen, who is either hopelessly jealous or a Couples lookalike. \"Maybe life came too easily to him for him to have the motivation to win the five majors his talent could've brought him. That said he wasn't quite so smooth against Christy O'Connor Jr at the Belfry.\" Another birdie for Kuchar, the third in a row, and he's at the turn in 33, -3. Couples makes an almighty mess of 11, pushing his approach way right, then duffing the chip onto the edge of the green. But he rakes in the par putt, and remains at -3. That dropped to the cheer of the day. Meanwhile, more from Sergio's Positive Mental Attitude Seminar: He nearly falls over when attempting to belt his driver down 13, slicing the ball into the trees down the right. He momentarily considers burying the head of the club, hosel deep, into the lush green turf, then after swearing in the Iberian style, thinks better of it. Well done, Sergio! Well done! Just keep it together, and everything will be OK. He's not going to keep it together, is he. Rory reaches the turn in 34 shots, -2, teasing a wee left-to-right dribbler into the cup for birdie at 9. He then clatters his 3-wood down the right at 10, but it doesn't draw and his ball snags in the semi-rough; he'll have a long second into the green. On 12, Sergio, having dropped his tee shot right into the heart of the green, misses a 20-foot birdie effort by inches. He lets his head drop in the trademark Sergio style, but then makes a conscious effort to lift it before tapping in for par. I wonder if he's been having a chat with someone about positive thinking? I do hope so. It never did Eric and Little Ern any harm. Another birdie for Matt Kuchar, this time at 8. He's going to win this, isn't he? Hmm. So anyway, up on 13, Guan knocks in a birdie putt from 15 feet, and he's back to +1! This is a truly amazing performance. \"Similar to the old trade unionists I aside a bottle of fine wine to celebrate Sergio's first major win,\" writes Richard Flockton. \"Unfortunately this turned out to be a lot less inevitable than the death of Margret Thatcher, as a result I have traded down over the years from beer to sparkling water via various soft drinks. Still I'm sure Sergio will appreciate a bottle of Perrier that was half opened then firmly shut in July 2007.\" The day doesn't end too well for Day. He duffs his third shot up the bank, leaving it in the rough. He elects to putt, but races his ball a good six feet past the hole. That'll be a tricky bogey putt - but it's one he makes. A double would have been a disaster, but he's still at -2 after signing for a 70. Meanwhile Fowler's long putt up the green isn't great, but he rattles in a 12-footer to save his par, and stay at -4. Back on 11, Sergio knocks his par putt in. That was grade-A course management, brilliant golf, play as stunning as some of his more swashbuckling efforts, just in a different way. Tiger's on the talk! \"It was a very solid day. I'm very pleased with the result. I've kept myself in the red, and we've a long way to go. I'm sure the greens will be a little more difficult tomorrow. It's very satisfying to get back to number one in the world. Some guys have never gotten there, having spent a long time trying to do so. I'm back there again.\" He looks mighty determined. Augusta watch out. Sergio chips out from the trees, taking his medicine. He then eases a wedge to four feet. Surely he'll save par? Surely. Even if he doesn't, that's a textbook example of how not to compound errors by trying to Seve it from everywhere. Up on 18, the fashionable, some would say gauche, youngsters Fowler and Day make a rare old balls of it. Fowler foolishly takes a driver instead of a 3-wood and finds the Lyle Bunker. He can only find the front of the green with his second, and has a job on to make par. Day meantime falls victim to a rush of adrenalin and sends a flyer through the green, leaving himself a puzzle at the back. Both lads are positioned well, at -4 and -3 respectively. They won't want to end with a depressing bogey. Fred Couples! He's just tapped home a lovely left-to-right swinger from the back of 10, Sergio Country, to move to -3. How on earth did he only ever win one major tournament? He's got a swing so smooth you can be forgiven for wondering whether it actually happened. And so it begins. Sergio's clattered his drive at 11 into the trees down the right. Ah well, better we know sooner than later. On 8, Keegan Bradley, who started poorly with bogeys at 5 and 6, has dribbled a very tricky downhill birdie putt into the cup on 8. He's back to +1 and looking calm enough. He's a great player, a couple of birdies and he's right back in position. Just look at this. Look where Sergio is. I can't take it. And we're only halfway through day one! -6 Leishman (F) -5 Garcia (10) -4 Lynn (F) Fowler (17) -3 Furyk (F) Z Johnson (F) Day (17) Fernandez-Castano (14) D Johnson (9) I got a bit over-excited describing that tee shot of Guan at 12; he was probably 20 feet away, looking at it again. Anyway, he gets up and down, and remains at +2. But up on 10, look at this! Sergio has a tricky putt down the green, 12 feet or so from the hole - and tickles it straight into the cup. It never looked like missing! He's -5, and looking full of confidence, having bounced back from the sort of missed opportunity which normally sends him spinning off into a parallel universe of funk. Help, I'm even beginning to believe in him now, never mind dream. This is no way to live. A couple of quiet moves from a couple of big quiet men. First Matt Kuchar birdies 7 to move to -1, then Martin Kaymer, who had been +2 after 4 but then birdied 6, curls in a 12-foot eagle putt on 8. He's also -1. \"SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO SERGIO,\" writes Peter Hutchinson. Yes, but what's your point? \"He's playing well.\" Ssh, don't draw attention to it, you'll break the spell. Guan my son! The 14-year-old Chinese prodigy has dropped a shot at 11, his first test around Amen Corner, but he's just knocked his tee shot at 12 to about 10, 12 feet. It'd be lovely to see him knock that in. Back on 10, Sergio sets himself up nicely too, finding the far-right corner of the green, the ball ten feet above the pin. Jason Day, the runner up here in 2011, is up to -3 after a run of three birdies between 13 and 15. Dustin Johnson is also going well, and he kisses a delightful little chip down the green at 9, from the apron at the back, the ball curling round into the cup after being set out to the right. \"Four under! Four bloody under!\" splutters Niall Mullen about You Know Who. \"He's going to finish three over isn't he?\" I'm not sure I can even talk about him any more. I just know heartbreak is coming at some point, it's just a matter of when. Why couldn't he start with a quadruple bogey? Why couldn't he do that? Bubba's just not been at the races today at all. He's boomed a monster down 18, then hits a fat wedge into the green, the ball rolling back down off the top shelf, towards the front, miles from the hole. Up on 13, Fernandez-Castano skelps his second shot into the heart of the green, then nearly rakes in a 20-foot left-to-right breaker for eagle. He gets the read correct, but doesn't quite hit it. Never mind, he's -3. But back on 7, Rory's in a wee spot of bother, pulling his approach from the middle of the fairway into a bunker on the left, and only getting his splash out to eight feet. He can't make the par putt, the ball always staying up on the left and horseshoeing out. He's back to -1. Another dropped shot for Lefty, this time at 7, unable to get up and down from a spot behind trees on the right. He's +2. On 8, Dustin Johnson pulls a short birdie putt to the left of the hole, and stays at -1. But his playing partner Sergio, having hit his approach pin high to eight feet, rattles in his birdie putt and hits the turn in 32! What a start by Sergio. I'm hoping that's a sign that his mind is in the right place; it's a brilliant response to missing out on a birdie at the previous hole by the length of a dimple. Nothing's going right for Bubba. He's +3 for his round, and has just missed a very makeable putt on 17 for birdie. He's in a wee mood. Back on 10, the nipper Guan birdies; he's back to +1. And here comes Amen Corner! At the other end of the age spectrum, Fred Couples is a turn of the ball away from an eagle on 8; he settles for his third birdie of the day and moves to -2. Meanwhile Rory makes his birdie putt on 6, moving to -2. That wasn't an easy putt at all, dribbling down the hill from 15 feet. \"It's getting about the time Luke needs to win a major,\" says Jack Nicklaus on Sky, in a slightly impatient fashion. He clearly thinks Donald has significantly underachieved, though I guess quite a few lesser mortals will have already come to that conclusion themselves already. Well, he clips a decent tee shot into the heart of 16, leaving himself a decent birdie chance from an uphill putt. Tiger's pin high, but an awful long way from the hole. His second putt is magnificent, though, perfectly paced to leave himself with a tap-in. Hey, you can't birdie everything. Following this maxim is Rickie Fowler, who creams his second on 15 to 12 feet, then curls the tricky right-to-left uphill putt into the hole for eagle. He's -3! Hello, who's this? It's Luke Donald, that's who it is. He's just carded his third birdie in a row, an eight-footer at 15 to move to -2. After a very slow start, this is becoming promising. Meanwhile on 8, Sergio leaves himself a 15-footer up the hill, a fairly straight effort. But he doesn't quite hit it, and leaves himself a dimple short. He does that pained look which makes the spectator either want to cuddle or batter some sense into him, depending on mood. But he's -3 through 8, as good a start as you can expect at Augusta. Woods bumps a magnificent chip into the bank at the side of the green, and sends the ball rolling to eight feet. He'll get his birdie after all, surely, and move back to -3. Perhaps that minor tantrum was more a delayed reaction to three-putting 14. What a position he'd be now without that. But no, he pulls his putt left of the hole, and stays at -2. Still, that's not too shabby for a player who rarely starts the Masters at full pelt. McIlroy meanwhile two putts from the front of 5; it's a very careful par, he's not pushing things too much at all, and in fact seems to be leaving his driver in the bag. Then on 6 he clips a 7-iron to the back right corner of the green, and will have a half-chance for birdie from about 15 feet. Tiger's just thrown the first of the toys out of the pram in a perfect parabola. He's pushed his approach to 15 into a difficult spot to the right of the green, with not a great deal of dancefloor to play with, the flag close to that edge. It's only his second stroke at the par five, but he'll have been thinking of birdie, and that's not going to be particularly easy from there. So the club clatters to the floor in a fit of pique. Then he picks it up and swings it a few times in the dramatic, forceful style. Oh dear. Meanwhile on 9, the nerveless young Guan drains a very missable bogey putt, rattling the ball straight into the cup from 15 feet; he's +2 at the turn, but that's a very decent effort from the teenager so far. -6 Leishman (F) -4 Lynn (F) -3 Furyk (F) Z Johnson (F) Garcia (7) -2 Nope, we'd be here all day So much for Tiger's fuss-free start! He's just handed the birdie he picked up at 13 straight back at the next. Through 14, he's -2. Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano has birdied 8 and 9 to move alongside the 14-time major winner. Meanwhile it's not been an ideal opening for Phil Mickelson, who birdied 2 but gave the shot back on 3 and has just dropped another at 5 to slip back to +1. Ominously, up trots Tiger. He's just birdied 13 to move to -3. This is fuss-free, and he's had other (mid-range) birdie chances that have gone mighty close, too. The antithesis of fuss-free is Rickie Fowler's round so far. He's -1 through 13, a round which has contained five birdies and two double bogeys. That's the sort of behaviour you'd expect from Dustin Johnson, but after the big man's birdie-birdie start, he's carded four pars in a row: -2 through 6. Marc Leishman is the clubhouse leader, having signed for a six-under 66. That really is quite special, especially after dropping a shot at the opening hole. A four-birdie blast between 13 and 16 sent him wheeching up the leaderboard. He's two clear of David Lynn, who dropped a shot at 17 but will be feeling pretty good about himself having stroked in a 15-foot par saver on the last. His 68 is as good as you'll see from a debutant round here. He couldn't do a Zoeller, could he? \"I was actually quite calm out there,\" he says. \"I played smart, I had a few chances, and I attacked as well. I was disappointed to miss that putt at 17, but all in all 68's a great score.\" When he was leading the tournament going round Amen Corner, he turned to his caddy and said: \"This is cool, eh? Leading the Masters?\" Haw. How about this for living the dream, then? Speaking of outstanding, Rose just stroked a 15-foot par saver straight into the cup on 18; he's signed for a very respectable round of 70, in a decent position in the clubhouse after the first day alongside Na, Toms, Clark, Westwood and Snedeker. With a few more surely to come. Though there are reports of possible storms later this afternoon, which could scupper a few plans. More amazing news from the 6th! Sergio has just birdied. That's three in six holes. He's -3. I know, I know, there's no point getting excited yet. But if he keeps this up, he'll end the tournament at 36 under par. The 14-year-old Guan, resident of the Crows' Nest, has dropped a shot at 7 to slip back to +1. But he's 14. It's just beyond belief. \"He was so consistent,\" said Tiger, who played a round with him. \"He was hitting a lot of hybrids into the holes, hitting them spot on, right on the numbers. He knew what he was doing, the spots he had to land the ball. Good scouting, good prep, but even better execution.\" Hole in one news! The debutant Jamie Donaldson of Wales has clattered an iron into the heart of the 6th green. The ball takes one big bounce forward, then another smaller one, then curls just to the left and drops into the cup for an ace! High fives all round. He's level par for the tournament through 10, having dropped shots at 1 and 10. Rory, then. He's come into the week in a good mood after his courageous efforts to turn his season round in Texas last week. He was certainly full of the joys of spring during the par-three competition. The high point came when his caddy and girlfriend, the erstwhile world number one tennis player Caroline Wozniacki, decided to take a shot herself. A better effort than most of us could manage, I'll be bound. Anyway, watching on Sky, Colin Montgomerie opined that \"I really don't want to say this, but I think my tennis game might be better than her golf game.\" After which Butch Harmon waited for a perfectly judged beat, before muttering in the deadpan style: \"I'd like to see that.\" So Rory was saying that he was missing everything in the \"wrong spots\" last year, and he thinks he's got a plan to avoid that mistake this time round. \"There are places where, even if you're playing badly, you can leave your ball and get up and down for your par,\" he says. Which is pretty much, incidentally, what six-time winner Jack Nicklaus has just been saying on Sky. Everyone thinks it's about power, but placement's the thing. So here's a good example of that: Rory decides not to have a lash at the green with his second shot from the top of the hill on the par-five 2nd, lays up in front of the bunker on the right, nearly holes the chip, and settles for a very pleasant par. He follows that with a par, and he's -1 though 3, as solid a start as you like. Guan Tianlang. My miserable Sunday junior medal efforts are all I can remember from my 15th year. He's back to level par midway through the front nine at the Masters. It's not so good for Northern Ireland's Alan Dunbar: he's +9 and bringing up the field through seven holes. An eight on the par-five second doing little to cheer matters. On that rather downbeat, yet unrelated note, Scott is back. Enjoy him. Cheers. \"I wondered if you would enjoy my blog on Seve winning the 1980 Masters in one of your quieter moments (fat chance I know)?\" writes Steve Pye, a member of our Sport Network who is well worth reading. \"I'm hoping for a European win this week. Growing up in the 80s/90s I became a bit spoilt by our successes, but it has been far too long since our last win, and I would love it, love it, if a European won this week.\" I'm easy, as long as it's Sergio. Lee Westwood, meanwhile, is in with a solid 70, good work considering his ugly six on the first. SERGIO UPDATE: all clear through four after a par. It's congested on -2, where Dustin Johnson has now landed, with birdies on two of the first three, as well as Rose following a bogey on the 17th. Lee Westwood is back to -2 after a bogey at 17, but moving a shot ahead of him is KJ Choi, who is now level with Furyk and Rose. \"It's in the bag. Sergio's tamed the all-important first two holes and now has the relatively straightforward remaining 70 to go. I am counting my winnings together with my chickens,\" declares Matt Emerson. Get counting: SERGIO'S ONLY GONE AND BIRDIED THE THIRD TOO! On the plus side for Paul in the previous post, Na is now four shots off the lead, Australia's Marc Leishman having gone on a four-hole birdie spree from 13 through to the par-three 16th, which he's just made a two on. Leishman is two clear of David Lynn, sat comfortably in the clubhouse. Or its environs. Evening. While Scott grabs some repast, you're lumbered with me. Anyway, here's a mail from Paul G Ince. \"Kevin Na needs to be shunned,\" he begins. Do go on. \"The man was responsible for Michael Hoey's disqualification after posting one of only four sub-par rounds in the windy day two play at the US Open last summer. Because of Na's slow play they were already getting warnings from the officials when Michael put a shot into a fairway sand trap. He had to move some sand to identify a plugged ball and wanted a ruling about what he should then do. Na put the pressure on for him to not wait for an official and Michael stupidly succumbed to the pressure. You may recall he later explained what had happened (after signing for his score) and was told he should have attempted to recreate the original lie. He was disqualified for signing an incorrect score (should have taken a penalty stroke for not restoring the lie). I hate Na.\" Well Paul, you probably won't be happy to learn Na has just finished his round, carding a solid opening 70. Right, I'm Bubba-da-Bubba-da-buggering off for a few minutes, overwhelmed as I am by the Sergio birdie. I'll be back anon, sad to say, but I'll leave you in the hands of writer, sports editor, and general all-round Renaissance man James Dart. Back in a wee while, by which time I expect Garcia to have Woosnamed his chances somehow (the 1991 winner finished with a bogey and signed for an 80, by the way). Oh Woosie! Time for a boozie. G-Mac's been all over the show of late. A double bogey at the short 12th, then a birdie at 13. He's not really been on his game today, but he's fighting just as you'd expect him to. \"Ah, you can always rely on Sergio to raise them there hopes,\" sighs Matt Dony. \"Before the inevitable happens. It's like watching Liverpool batter Man City. (Twice! How did they both end up as draws!) But really, in your heart of hearts, you know you're going to be disappointed. Upper mid-table beckons.\" To be fair to Sergio, since his opening birdie, he's managed to go one hole in a row without handing it straight back again. He's still -1 after 2. Rejoice! And let's dream a little. While we can. KJ Choi has just failed to hit a very makeable 20-foot eagle putt on 13. He'd have had a share of the lead with another couple of turns. As it is, his birdie takes him to -3. He's a shot behind Lynn - and Leishman, who cards his second birdie on the spin at 14 to move to that -4 mark. David Toms is in the clubhouse changing his shoes with a smile, having signed for a two-under 70. And Croatian sausage abuser Simon Farnaby (see increasingly manic entries passim) won't like this: Ben Curtis, who won the 2003 Open with a confused look on his coupon, has birdied 7 to move to -2. He's not been the scar on the Open roll of honour that Todd Hamilton was, that second place at the 2008 PGA took at least some of the bitter edge off. Snedeker has now birdied both of the par fives on the back nine, and is -2 through 15. Another magnificently entertaining man, Dustin Johnson, is out and about, and he's birdied the 1st. Only another 71 chances left for a spectacular blow-up, then. Speaking of spectacular blow-ups, here's Simon Farnaby again, high as a kite on half-cooked sausages, and seemingly pushed over the edge once and for all by that list of former major winners currently on one under par. \"Langer? Have you gone mad?\" he jabbers. \"Also, Thomas Bjorn won the Open in Two Thousand and ... oh no, he totally [word deleted by Golfing Meltdown Editor] it leaving us with the most embarrassing Open champion bar Todd Hamilton and until that [word deleted by Golfing Nervous Breakdown Editor] who defeated Tom Watson whose name, incredibly, has finally been erased from my memory. Come on Bernhard Booze!\" I'm sorry you have to see this, everyone. I don't think I mentioned that Bubba dropped another shot, this time on 7; he's +2 at the turn, and his bid to become only the fourth man to retain the Masters title - after Jack Nicklaus, Nick Faldo and Tiger Woods - is already looking on slightly shaky ground. Kevin Na is currently in second place in the clubhouse behind the leader Lynn, having signed for his two-under 70. Between Lynn and Na on the actual leaderboard at -3, mind, are Furyk, Rose, Leishman - and now Lee Westwood, who has birdied 15, his fourth in seven holes. This is a simply stunning effort by the Worksop wonder, who started out today with that double at 1. IT'S SERGIO!!! He's just birdied the 1st. You can look at this two ways. What a start! Or: the only way is down. Anyway, his playing partner Adam Scott has also started with a birdie. Hopefully both of them can get something going. David Lynn's made it to the clubhouse without further hassles, and signs for an opening round of 68. That's such a superlative effort from the 39-year-old debutant; remember that there's been no first-time winner at Augusta since Fuzzy Zoeller back in 1979. Tiger has found his range now. He's just birdied 8 to move to -2. The Australian Marc Leishman, playing in only his second Masters, has just stroked in a short birdie putt on 13 to move to -3, one off the lead. And there's a gaggle of major champions at -1: McDowell, Ben Curtis, Mark O'Meara, Thomas Bjorn, Trevor Immelman and Bernhard Langer. -4 Lynn (17) -3 Furyk (13) Rose (13) -2 Na (17) Toms (16) Clark (14) Westwood (13) Leishman (12) Choi (10) Senden (10) Snedeker has made his birdie. That is simply ludicrous. What an escape, what a player. I forgot to mention that he'd got up and down from a nigh-on impossible position over the back of 12, too. He's -1 for this. A birdie for his playing partner Rose, too, who moves to -3. And he's one behind the leader Lynn, who has dropped one on 17 and is now only -4. Only. This is his first ever competitive round at Augusta! Snedeker has just played a chip of Seve-esque delicacy, mixed with a little Mickelson-like bravado, to toss his ball high into the air from the hazard and into the centre of the green. If he knocks that in for birdie, it'll be beyond outrageous. \"I'm not sure how I'd feel about Sergio winning,\" writes Niall Mullin. \"I loved him as El Ni\u00f1o, as angry Sergio and broken, despondent Sergio. Could I truly love Sergio Garcia, Masters Champion? I don't know but I'd like to find out.\" Yep, me too. Next in Niall's series: what he feels like when Mickelson wins the Open in high winds; Liverpool become Premier League champions under Brendan Rodgers; and Scott Murray puts down the first deposit on his luxury yacht after becoming the second MBM millionaire (a few minutes after Smyth). And so it begins. Snedeker has dumped his second shot into the creek along the front of the 13th green, but he's dry on the downslope towards the water. That's a hellish position, doubly so because he can't ground his club. This is going to be good fun. Meanwhile up ahead, Westwood rakes in a 20-footer for his third birdie in five holes. He's -2 and looking in the right mood for this. Also feeling rather chipper are David Toms, who has eagled 15 to move to -2, and Charl Schwartzel, who was +3 after 3 holes, and has responded with birdies at 5, 6 and 8. You have to love Ian Woosnam. After two double bogeys and two bogeys in six holes, he's eagled 15 - and then dropped a shot at 16. He remains at +7, propping up the field with two-time winner Tom Watson, who has had the good grace to drop his shots in a much more quiet, refined, regular fashion. \"Embarrassing tee shots you say?\" pipes up Colm Gilmore, having been reminded of Woosie's caper down 13 (and back up 13, and back down it again). \"My brother, Paul (Tour nickname: The Big Indian) currently holds our Tour record for the longest fanny ever recorded (a fanny of course being where you don't hit your drive past the ladies' tee: penalty on our Tour = having to buy a round of drink for all your playing partners: much more hurtful than trouser-dropping shenanigans or suchlike). Anyway, The Big Indian stood up to the tee and smote a crisp, rising drive that looked majestic...right up until it hit a tree just off the fairway 150 yards away, flush, and rebounded back in a straight line to finish a couple of yards behind the ladies tee...lucky for them he couldn't see his playing partners jumping up and down on the tee at the prospect of free drink behind the Woosnam-esque red mist that had suddenly descended around his ears. The first ever 300-yard fanny. Boy, did we enjoy that pint. Tiger finally makes his first move. A birdie at 6. And so it begins. Although all the big noise is being made at the moment by Kevin Na, who may be thinking of changing his name by deed poll to... well, you can fill in the obvious. Na looked all over the shop after a double bogey on 9 dropped him back to +2, but he's birdied 12, then eagled 15 and birdied 16, and all of a sudden he's -2, three off the lead and only a couple of holes from home. KJ Choi's also turned things round rather wonderfully, birdies at 6 and 7 and then another at 9 taking him to -2 at the turn. There's more than enough going on here. A sad end to the debutant John Peterson's round, with his first bogey of the day at 17. But he'll not be too concerned, he'll have taken a one-under 71 at the start of the day. Same goes for oor Sandy and his one-over 73, a shot dropped at 17 like his playing partner Peterson. They're both in the clubhouse, though, the first group home, and that's a decent enough round from the old boy. \"Snedeker is a great player who likes a laugh and a giggle,\" notices Simon Farnaby. \"He's the Henri Leconte of golf. If he didn't have such a horrendous name and wasn't from America we'd all love him. If he was called Jose Meringue or Bernard Booze he'd be everyone's favorite major anus-clencher (after Sergio).\" I think you've been eating too many of those unconventionally cooked sausages. You probably need a drink. Westwood's playing partner, Furyk, scrambled a fantastic par at 12, having found himself in a lot of trouble off the back of the green. Brandt's Amazing Golf Rollercoaster continues to skitter around in the hysterical fashion, incidentally: he drops a shot on 11 to move back to level par, but it'll feel almost like a gain having drained a huge bogey putt from the apron. He could either end the day four under or four over. In some ways, there's little point following him. And of course in many others, there's every point. Tiger is still stuck on par, five in a row at the start of his round. He'll not be worrying too much about this. He's occasionally suffered from slow, stuttering starts, a dropped shot or two here and there eventually costing him at the business end of a major. He'll be happy enough to keep things drama free for a while, there's plenty of time for him to find his groove. Meanwhile on 11, Rose is a simple away from draining a 30-foot birdie effort; he stays at -2. And Westwood can only par 12, but in fairness he was probably 12-15 feet away from the pin, so ignore my earlier prattle. Westwood has just skulked off the 11th green in a mild tizz, having spurned a half-chance to make birdie. It would have been his third in a row. He channels that funk, though, and whistles a gorgeous tee shot at 12 straight over the flag. That's not a gimmie, but it is an eight-footer which he'd hope to knock straight into the cup. But the big news is being made by David Lynn, who moves to -5, two clear of Furyk, with a birdie at the par-five 15th. Three more holes, David, and this will be one of the great debut rounds. Three more holes. Snedeker is great fun. Birdies at 2 and 3, a double bogey at 5, another dropped shot at 7, and now his second set of back-to-back birdies at 8 and 9. He's -1 through 10, and still has a couple of holes to get himself further up the leaderboard before that triple-bogey 8 at 13 which has been widely predicted (by us, and admittedly nobody else). McDowell's moved back into the red figures, too, with a birdie on 8, while Donald has got over that awful start with birdies at 2 and 4, and is -1 alongside G-Mac. I've already got a good feeling about this Masters, it's going to shape up to be a stone-cold classic. You see if I'm wrong. The early leader Pettersson has been all over the show since his early burst of three birdies in the first five holes. Bogeys at 9 and 10 pushed him right back into the field, but he's just rolled in a very smooth 15-foot right-to-left breaker at 12, a birdie which takes him back to level par through 12. \"I'd very much recommend Bunny and The Bull, a surreal film comedy by the Boosh team that Simon Farnaby was in,\" writes James Debins. \"My best friend and I loved it. I'm sure I've seen him in my block in E1, too.\" Then you may enjoy the golf book he wrote, James. I make no claims for his clown of a co-author, though. Padraig Harrington had a magnificent year in the majors last year, taking decent runs at the Masters and, especially, the US Open. He'd have won the latter if his putter was working properly. So he's a decent dark horse for this, having dragged himself out of the slump of 2010 and 2011. He's started well today, with a birdie at 3. Thorbjorn Olesen, a major winner of the future surely, is following in Harrington's footsteps in the group behind; he too has picked up a first birdie of the event at 3. Bubba, having bounced back to level par, has slipped back to +1 again with a dropped shot at 5. His Golf Boy colleague Rickie Fowler opened with a double bogey, but birdied 2 and remains +1 through 3. Tiger, meanwhile, is quietly pootling along, having opened with four pars in a row. I should stop mentioning players doing well, I'm just causing carnage. Clark has just three-putted from the front of 11 to drop back to -1. The par putt he missed, from five feet or so, was a very uncertain prod. Keegan Bradley and Ernie Els are all good and well, but as rules of thumb go, \"never trust a player with a bloody daft long putter\" is as good as it gets. Lee Westwood refused to lose the noggin after that opening-hole double bogey, and suddenly it looks as though he's putting a half-decent round together. He'd picked a shot back up on 2, of course, and now he's just bagged a couple more, on 9 and then 10, to move to -1 for the tournament. Tim Clark of South Africa, second here in 2006 and a player who has threatened for years to break into the top echelons without ever quite making it, is moving in the right direction too: he's birdied 6, 7 and 10 to make it to -2. 1988 champion special. \"Loving that pro-Lyle &amp; Garcia bias as ever, Scott,\" writes Euan Hendrie, the only person not thoroughly sick of my repetitive shtick. \"Am becoming misty-eyed at the memory of the 13 year-old me jumping about the living room in my pyjamas in celebration of our hero\u2019s 1988 triumph (I\u2019d been allowed to stay up late especially). Surely the big man\u2019s due a run of par 5 birdies on the back nine to hoist him back up where he belongs. Mind you, he was surely due the Ryder Cup captaincy as well.\" Well, you say that, but he's just birdied 15, and is level par for the tournament! His playing partner John Peterson also birdied the hole, and after his quiet, softly softly start, is suddenly -2, just two off the sole leader Lynn. You'll notice the use of the word \"sole\" there: Furyk has bogeyed 9 to relinquish his joint ownership of the lead. And finally some more Woosie news: he escaped with a bogey on 13 after all those shenanigans, though he's +7 through 13. 1991 champion latest. The most embarrassing shot I've ever played at golf - and by God there is a long list - was a topped drive which hit a metal bin on the ladies tee, then rebounded back in front of the green on the preceding hole. I can still hear the guffaws of the group following us round as I trudged back to play my second shot, 50 yards behind the tee, my humiliation complete. The reason I mention this is, I wonder how Ian Woosnam is feeling now, a professional and former Masters champion, who sent his drive at 13 near the trees down the left, then clattered his second onto a thick trunk, the ball catapaulting back past his lugs, forcing him to trudge off in a hot funk miles back up the fairway, a long way further from the hole than he was in the first place. He's just come off a double bogey at 12, and won't be in a good place mentally, you can be sure of that. McDowell has just handed his birdie on 5 straight back at 6, but European fans fear not. Rose has just picked up a shot on 8, moving to -2 alongside Brian Gay, Ryo Ishikawa and John Senden. That bunch are two shots behind the leader Jim Furyk - who has been joined at -4 by Lynn, the PGA runner up making no mistake with that birdie opportunity on 12. This is a magnificent performance from the Masters debutant; if he manages to get home without too many mistakes, this will qualify as a fairytale round. Ah. Potter Jr has just bogeyed 11, his fourth dropped shot of the day. He's +2. \"I don't care about the curse saying you can't win both,\" he said. \"Just winning something here makes my week already.\" Some birdie news that may cause the sensation of happiness across Europe: one for Colsearts on 2, and for McDowell on 5. \"I\u2019ve backed Furyk and Rose this week, who appear to have started well, but let me assure your reader(s) that this is a temporary affair,\" grumps Jonathan Wood. \"I have also placed a bet on every golfing Major for as long as I can remember, and last won when Olazabal won his second Masters in 1999. I am the curse of winning the Par 3 tournament. By the way, who did win it yesterday?\" That'd be unheralded debutant Ted Potter Jr, who won a play-off which Phil Mickelson and Matt Kuchar may or may not have opted to throw. (Ernie Els and Nick Watney didn't even bother to take up their option to compete in it.) Potter Jr, perhaps of a mind that he'll not be getting dressed in the Butler Cabin come Sunday evening, seemed pretty happy with his win. \"Just to be here and a part of it is awesome and a dream come true. It is special to me.\" Feelgood's back, baby. And it's better than ever! (Provided you haven't bet on the last 51 majors without success.) While it's Lynn's first Masters, it's Furyk's 17th. They're having a lovely tussle for the lead at the moment. The American's just made it three birdies on the bounce with another at 8, and stands alone at the top of the tree at -4, but Lynn's just clipped his tee shot at the hellish 12th pin high to six feet. There are no gimmes at Augusta, but that's a chance to pick up another shot. Lynn's playing partner Woosnam dunks his tee shot in the drink, and storms down the hole saying words that begin with EFF, CEE and BASTA. And back on 2, Bubba's bounced back with a birdie. It's already hotting up, in more ways than one, and we're only a couple of hours in. Got some Masters golf going on over here! David Lynn hasn't taken that dropped shot at 10 to heart. He's plopped his approach at 11 on the front of the green, then raked a 30-footer into the cup for birdie! He's back at -3. John Peterson's run of 12 straight pars has come to an end with a birdie at 13; the debutant is one off Lynn and Furyk's lead. And Tiger's out and about: he's parred the opening hole. More of him anon, I'll be bound. Luke Donald, who was world number one not so long ago, but has fallen off the radar a wee bit, has opened with a bogey. It's been an up and down start for KJ Choi, who traded bogey and birdie on the opening two holes, and has just dropped another at 4; he's +1. Larry Mize isn't going away yet; having dropped a shot at 9 to fall back to level par, he's raked one in from the back of 12 to move back to -1. And Peter Kearney is confused by Simon Farnaby's description of Sergio Garcia's putting technique. \"Nervously toddling putts whilst clenching anus \u2026 have I missed an issue of Golf Digest? Is this the 2013 version of the \u2018claw-grip\u2019?\" Here's how the top of it looks. You'll notice there's been a switcheroo, the veteran Furyk with a second birdie in a row at 7, the debutant-veteran Lynn dropping his first shot of the day at 10. You'll also notice there's only two players on our leaderboard. That's because there are so many players currently at -1, we'd be here all day. The 4pm leaderboard would crash into the 5pm leaderboard, there could be all manner of serious implications for the space-time continuum. I'm not prepared to take the risk. I suppose the time I've taken to write all this prattle could have been better spent typing up the list of names at -1, but it's done now. -3 Furyk (7) -2 Lynn (10) Bubba's out. Our emotional hero. The 2012 champion and hairiest Golf Boy won't be in the best frame of mind after the first hole of his defence: a bogey five. Boo hoo de hoody hoo. Another Green Jacket owner, Ian Woosnam, is suffering a bit this morning: bogeys at 5 and 7 and now a double at 9; he's +4 through 10 and propping up the nascent leaderboard. Time for a calming pint, perhaps, which he can then eject through his nose, K Club style, should the fancy take him. Feelgood's back, baby! It's back! And it's all thanks to David Lynn, who has now birdied 9 to grab sole ownership of the lead. This is marvellous. Also heading the right way is Ryo Ishikawa, who opened with a bogey but bounced back with a birdie at 2, and has now moved to -1 with his second birdie of the day at 5. John Peterson, meanwhile, has opened his first-ever Masters with 11 straight pars, and nearly broke the sequence in unconventional fashion, hitting the flag at 12 with an excitable chip from the bank at the front of the green. That's 12 in 12. Faldoesque. The Snedeker meltdown's come earlier than anyone dared to suggest. He's carded a double-bogey six at 5, and is back at level par. Pettersson's just dropped a shot at 6, too - he's only parred one hole today so far - and is back at -1. So it's all change at the top of the nascent leaderboard, with Jim Furyk having added to his birdie at 3 with another at 6, and Lynn consolidating his flying start with a second birdie of his day at 8. The pair are at -2. \"To further clarify Sergio's deficiencies,\" begins Simon Farnaby, holding both of his lapels and clearing his throat, \"he never twats his putts miles past the hole. He usually nervously toddles them whilst clenching his anus and they stop with a pathetic little pinball of two spike marks about 1cm pre or left or right adjacent to the hole. Don't think I'll let anyone get away with misrepresenting Sergio's faults, I practically have a degree in them.\" Ah, the feelgood buzz of the Masters. It's lasted less than two hours on your Super Soaraway Guardian Sport before descending into hot-faced abuse. Recriminations at 6pm, regret coming along at eight bells. But hey, that's why you love us. Right? Hello? The defending champion Bubba is out soon, to be followed not long after by Tiger. While there's a slight lull, now may be a good time to learn a little about playing the game of golf. God knows I could do with a few tips. So thank the Lord for Augusta legend Bobby Jones, here to tell you how to use your niblick properly in the sand. A warning to viewers under the age of 95: the gender politics on display in this film may raise an eyebrow with those used to more modern social mores, although the wife has the pleasure of delivering the zinger at the end, while hubby - a brazen, golf-obsessed liar - doesn't get the cocktail he's asked his butler Wilson to mix for him. Par for McDowell, who came 12th here last year, at the opening hole.Rose, whose best finish is that fifth place back in 2007, has dropped back to -1 with a bogey at 3; incidentally the winner that day, Zach Johnson, has opened this time with a bogey. \"I don't think Matt Emerson needs to worry about Sergio twatting his driver all over the park, he's usually pretty reliable with it,\" writes Michael Hatcher, in an email entitled Happy Happy Sergio Time, a shameless attempt to grab my attention. He's a false advertiser, too, because he's not offering us Happy Happy Sergio Time at all. In fact, what he's shilling is most definitely Unhappy Unhappy Sergio Time (which you might also know simply as Sergio Time). \"It's the prospect of him twatting 3-foot putts left, right and miles past the hole that usually has me hiding behind my eyes behind a cushion. Wonder if he's tried putting with his driver?\" Ssh, for Christ's sake don't be giving him any ideas. Pettersson's back, baby. A birdie on 5 takes him to -2 again, alongside Rose, and now the aforementioned Snedeker, who's posted back-to-back birdies at 2 and 3. As suggested by Channel 4's new Sausages Correspondent, Simon Farnaby, the goodtime gambler Snedeker has a collapse in him, but it'll be a hell of a ride if he can hang on in there. He was brilliant at Lytham last year, and topped off 2012 rather nicely with that FedEx Cup win. He was in good form early this year, too, before falling victim to rib knack. Here's hoping he stays fit through this and keeps proceedings lively. A dismal start for the 2011 champ Charl Schwartzel, with a double bogey on the opening hole. But what's this? A birdie on 8 for Sandy, that's what! He's back to +1 and technically not out of this yet. Eh? Meanwhile spare a thought for poor Simon Farnaby, who is gadding around Croatia making a documentary for Channel 4 about \"a man who can cook sausages with his eyes\". Well, that's me sold, I'll be setting the planner for that, although it's probably only fair to point out to the rest of you that other television stations are available. Anyway, he's after watching a bit of golf mid-gad, but it's not on the telly over there, which is a shame. At least he won't be forced to watch all his hard-earned cash float away in front of his horrified eyes: \"I've put money on Garcia (waste of time) Louis (probably can't be arsed) and Snedeker (will get in contention then laugh his way to an 8 on 13).\" So much for my corpulent dream. Pettersson bogeys 4 and drops back into a large pack at -1. Rose is the sole leader of this tournament at the moment, as a moment's contemplation of this leaderboard will show you: -2 Rose (2) -1 Mize (7) Gay (7) Lynn (6) Sterne (6) Streelman (5) Pettersson (4) Furyk (3) Snedeker (2) Hanson (1) If you want to be a professional sports star, is it better to spend a lot of time at the gym, or ingest various pleasurable ingredients such as lard, sugar, pastry and bacon dripping at regular intervals? The jury is very much out at the moment, kids, with the evidence inconclusive: the cheery Petterson is still leading this competition on -2 through 3, but he's been joined at the top of the early leaderboard by the fitness-obsessed worrier Rose, who has added to his birdie at 1 with another at the par-five 2nd. Brian Gay was up there with the pair for a wee while, but after birdies at 2 and 6 he's dropped a shot at 7 and is back at -1. Lee Westwood has moved to America in order to continue his search for that elusive first major. He may as well have relocated to Amersham, Ambleside or Ancoats for all the good it's done him, because he's run up a double bogey at the 1st. In fairness, he's responded well with a birdie at 2, but he's still +1, far from a perfect start. Speaking of elusive first majors, here's Matt Emerson with the first email of this year's Masters coverage. The subject heading caught my eye: \"This is Sergio's year.\" Matt is talking my language. \"I can feel it in my water. He\u2019s in decent form \u2013 tied third in the Cadillac with Lefty and McDowell among others \u2013 and he just seems happier than he has for a long, long time. I\u2019ve placed my usual sum on him and \u2013 at this point \u2013 am feeling extremely confident. Largely because he hasn\u2019t twatted his first drive 30 yards left. Yet.\" And the great news is, you can feel that warm glow, guaranteed, for another three hours. Now this is what I like to see. Big, comfortable, cuddly Carl Pettersson leading the Masters, after a birdie-birdie start to his round. He's obviously taken succour from his performance at the PGA last year, when he finished third. Professional sport is far too obsessed with athletes these days. We've got athletics for that. I'd pay good money to see the likes of Pettersson trudging up the last on Sunday in contention, preferably alongside aforementioned cheroot chugger Nicolas Colsearts or steak-and-cigar-fuelled 2009 winner Angel Cabrera. Golf's one of the few sports where the body fascists have yet to totally wrestle the upper hand - they've ruined football and especially rugby union for a start - so long may this state of affairs continue. In this respect at least, it's a game of the people. Meanwhile stringbean Justin Rose has birdied the opening hole. Could this be his year, when the promise he showed in his near miss of 2007 is finally realised? Dunno, but I have a sudden craving for cake. The aforementioned Tianlang Guan wasn't even born when Tiger Woods won his first Masters. Life gets increasingly preposterous as you get on, doesn't it. Anyway, what of Tiger? He'll not be out for another hour or so, but in the meantime, let us reflect on his record at Augusta National. He's been here 16 times, winning on a quarter of his visits. He's had two runners-up spots, and ten top-five finishes. If you tot up all his rounds here, he's -68. Sixty eight under par. ! Expect him to whittle that cumulative total down further, too, for after a couple of years in the doldrums, he's sorted his putting out. Last year, he was waving the damn thing around like a divining rod, hunched over the ball, almost as though he had the weight of the world on his shoulders for some reason or another. Now he's improved his posture, standing much more upright, and his stroke is as smooth as silk. He's already won three tournaments since the turn of the year, and the last two he's entered. He's coming into this week with cachet, baby. He's got cachet up the yin-yang. Lynn isn't the only debutant we'll have to keep an eye on today. For a start, there's bad news for Kevin Na, certain to lose his status as Slacker's Choice to John Huh. Also pootling down Magnolia Drive for the first time are Jamie Donaldson of Wales; the young Dane Thorbjorn Olesen, who had such a good Open at Lytham last year; the South African pair George Coetzee and Branden Grace, both hoping to join their compatriots Gary Player, Trevor Immelman and Charl Schwartzel on the roll of honour; fashionable pop platter-spinner and cigarette lover Nicolas Colsearts; and the 14-year-old Chinese prodigy Tianlang Guan. Fourteen years old! Half of us will age that much over the next four days, simply by watching this unfold. Fourteen, though. Sandy's currently tied for 10th in this year's Masters. Not bad for one of the older gentlemen in the field. Until you realise there are only 12 players currently out on the course, and as another two of them are tied with him in 10th, that technically makes him rock bottom. He's bogeyed 4 now to drop to +2. I think I might give him the respect of letting him go about his business quietly, he doesn't need us pestering him. Better news for David Lynn, who waited 39 years to take his first competitive shot at Augusta and hasn't been impatient to have many more too quickly. He's birdied his first-ever Masters hole, and he's -1 alongside Mize, Brian Gay and Kevin Na. That's great to hear. Lynn's reaction upon finding out that his second-place finish at the PGA last year earned him a place here was, for me, the televisual moment of 2012. He tried to hide his childlike delight at learning the news, mid-interview on Sky, but couldn't quite manage it, and wandered off with his pearlers gleaming in the sun, an ambition achieved. Brought a tear, so it did, a lovely display of innocence not often seen in professional sport. It was the bizarro Shreeves-Ivanovic incident, Sky putting a little feelgood karma pack into the pot. Good, then we'll begin. I wasn't going to start for another hour, I'll regret this come 11pm, but I can't help it, I've got Masters Fever. You'll stay with me to dab my brow, yes? Now then, the first shot of this year's tournament was taken by the 1988 winner and all-round legend Alexander Walter Barr Lyle. He creamed his drive straight down the middle, and true to form went on to run up five shots. One over after one. He's gone on to par the second and third holes, so there's the Good Ship Sandy steadied for a while at least. The first birdie of the tournament was carded by the man who presented Sandy with his Green Jacket, the Norman-bothering Larry Mize. There's the early leader, then. So much excitement already, and this report's not technically due to begin for 65 minutes. Oosthuizen raking home an albatross. Mickelson melting down in a thicket. Bubba snap hooking from the trees to victory. We'll be doing rather well if the 77th edition of the Masters Tournament serves up anything half as good as the 76th. So what sort of denouement are you hoping and praying for this time? Another shot-shapin' masterclass from Bubba? Tiger and Rory trading blows during a summit meeting along the back nine? Lefty making a trademark final-day charge from so far back in the pack you'd swear he began his run-up in North Carolina? Me, I'd settle for Sergio needing a birdie on the last to win, clunking an adrenalin-fuelled second 50 yards past the flag from prime position in the centre of the fairway, then thinning a chip which looks like it's going to go straight through the green and a hundred yards back down the hole, but instead hits the flagstick and slamdunks into the cup. But I'm not fussy. I'm good with any of those options, really, and then some. Each Masters makes an indelible mark on the history book whoever wins and however they do it. But some marks would be signed off with more of a flourish than others. While the likes of Rory, Lee, Sergio, Justin, Graeme, Ian, Sergio, Louis, Sergio, Keegan, Dustin, Sergio, Adam, Brandt, Hunter and Sergio are looking for their first win, others are in a position to trouble the higher reaches of Augusta's roll of honour. Can Bubba or the 2011 champion Charl Schwartzel claim a second Green Jacket and membership of an exclusive club of two-time winners that includes Tom Watson, Ben Hogan, Bernhard Langer and Seve? Can Lefty, a three-time champion alongside your Nick Faldos and Gary Players, move on up alongside Tiger and Arnold Palmer? And will Tiger win his 15th major this week to become the second-greatest Masters champion of all time? We don't do this enough in golf, but here's the roll of honour in the Masters: 6: Jack Nicklaus 4: Arnold Palmer, Tiger Woods 3: Jimmy Demaret, Sam Snead, Gary Player, Nick Faldo, Phil Mickelson 2: Horton Smith, Byron Nelson, Ben Hogan, Tom Watson, Seve Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer, Ben Crenshaw, Jose Maria Olazabal Not too many chancers in that roll call, eh? Perhaps the one name that sticks out, simply through lack of familiarity to modern eyes, is that of Jimmy Demaret. He won three Green Jackets between 1940 and 1950, some of his best years lost to the war. He would surely have won an Open, too, had he not just played in one tournament in which he finished tied for tenth place: some say he was the best wind player ever, firing low 1-irons under the breeze which you \"could hang your laundry on\", having learned to play in Galveston, where of course you can hear the sea winds blowin'. Demaret wasn't so afraid of dyin', though. \"Get out and live,\" was his motto. \"You're dead for an awful long time.\" And he took his own advice, boy oh boy. He wore the sort of garish clothing which would have made Payne Stewart look like Johnny Cash. He didn't really bother with, or need, practice. He enjoyed the odd calming pint or two. And he hung around with the likes of Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, holding his own with these dudes, crooning in the nightclub style and cracking the odd zinger. \"You have a great short game,\" he once told Hope. \"Unfortunately, it's off the tee.\" Anyway, where are we?
