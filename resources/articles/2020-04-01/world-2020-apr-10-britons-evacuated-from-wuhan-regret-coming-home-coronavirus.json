All those repatriated from Wuhan underwent two weeks of quarantine in the Wirral, and after a brief stint of normality, May-Smith is now back in lockdown, wishing he had stayed put in China. \u201cIt\u2019s just really weird, getting thrown back into it,\u201d the 26-year-old from Lichfield said. He never imagined that the UK would end up in a lockdown: \u201cIt just makes you think, all the hassle that we went through to come back, was it really worth it?\u201d He was in Wuhan visiting his girlfriend, Yenny, and had been offered a job teaching English there. Now he\u2019s working as a truck driver and regularly sleeps in his vehicle to avoid the risk of infecting his grandparents at home. \u201cLooking at it now, I wish I hadn\u2019t come back,\u201d he said. \u201cI would be coming out of lockdown now, and instead I\u2019m just going into one.\u201d He\u2019s not alone. Fellow evacuee Matt Raw, 38, is enjoying life in lockdown in Knutsford, but said if he\u2019d known how bad the outbreak was going to get in Britain, he would have stayed in China. \u201cIt feels a little bit like out of the pot, into the fire,\u201d said Raw, who was living in Wuhan with his wife, Ying, and 75-year-old mother, Hazel, who suffers from dementia. \u201cWe made the wrong decision coming back here. We should have stayed in China.\u201d He said the UK was \u201cslow to act\u201d and he was surprised the UK didn\u2019t quarantine people flying into the country. \u201cI just sat watching the news incredulously every single day. What was the point of putting us in quarantine?\u201d He said he feels lucky to be living through lockdown in a spacious house with a garden, adding that his home in Wuhan was more cramped, and like many inner-city apartments in China, had little natural light. \u201cWe made our decision based on the best information available at the time. Hindsight is a wonderful thing.\u201d he said. \u201cYes, I wish we\u2019d stayed there. But by the same token, it\u2019s also nice to be back over here again.\u201d Jeff and Sindy Siddle, now in lockdown in Prudhoe, Northumberland, also questioned whether leaving Wuhan had been the best course of action, but decided that \u2013 despite their nightmare journey \u2013 it was the best thing to do. \u201cOverall I think we still made the right decision, but certainly we have asked the question,\u201d said Jeff. The couple, along with their 10-year-old daughter, Jasmine, had been visiting Sindy\u2019s family in a village in Hubei province, three hours drive from Wuhan, when the lockdown took effect. \u201cHere, we can stay at home, we can do our jobs no problem,\u201d said Sindy, an accounting assistant. \u201cAnd Jasmine can do her school work. Back in Wuhan I was worried about her being the only one off school for a long time, but now all the kids are off, so I\u2019m much more relaxed.\u201d The one positive to come out of their Wuhan ordeal is their preparedness for the outbreak over here. \u201cI think we are probably more cautious than a lot of the people in the UK because we\u2019ve been through it before,\u201d said Jeff. \u201cWe\u2019ve been much more worried about it and we go out a lot less than our friends and family. We\u2019re so worried we don\u2019t go out beyond the garden, other than to the supermarket once a week, and we do click and collect to avoid going in.\u201d The family originally faced being split apart, when Sindy was told she wouldn\u2019t be allowed on the UK repatriation flight as she had a Chinese passport. Chris Hill, another Briton out in Wuhan, faced a similar problem after the Foreign Office was unable to confirm whether his wife and four-year-old daughter, both Chinese nationals, would be able to join him on the flight home. He decided to stay put. \u201cI made the choice to stay because I didn\u2019t want to risk leaving them,\u201d said the 38-year-old from Sunderland, who has lived in Wuhan for 12 years and works as an English language teacher. \u201cI did falter a couple of times and I would start having regrets. But I knew the lockdown wouldn\u2019t last forever.\u201d After nearly 76 days stuck inside, and tight restrictions on movement still in place, he\u2019s confident he was better off in China. \u201cI\u2019m still glad I made the decision to stay,\u201d he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 April 2020.
