In a speech to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Western Australia, which acknowledged the \u201cchallenges and headwinds\u201d facing the economy, Morrison said the government\u2019s previous red tape-cutting initiatives had created savings of $5.8bn. But now he wants to go further, shifting the onus to business and industry to identify the delays, using Donald Trump\u2019s economic plan as the inspiration. \u201cThis will be a renewed focus on regulatory reform but from a different angle,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cRather than setting targets for departments or government agencies, we\u2019ll be asking the wider question from the perspective of a business looking, say, to open a mine, commercialise a new biomedical innovation, or even start a home-based family business. \u201cBy focusing on regulation from the viewpoint of business, we will identify the regulations and bureaucratic processes that impose the largest costs on key sectors of the economy and the biggest hurdles to letting those investments flow,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile reducing taxes has had a major impact in the United States, it was actually the Trump administration\u2019s commitment to cutting red tape and transforming the regulatory mindset of the bureaucracy that delivered their first wave of improvement in their economy.\u201d Morrison said agencies such as the WA Environment Protection Authority had created uncertainty over emissions targets for the resources sector and were a barrier to investment. That comes after reports WA is considering going alone with its own carbon price, in the face of the federal government\u2019s insistence it will meet its Paris targets, despite the government\u2019s own data showing emissions continuing to increase. Asked about states going forward with individual plans, Morrison reiterated the Coalition\u2019s insistence on \u201cresponsible targets\u201d. \u201cWell, all I know is that when any target is set that is not responsible and there are not clear policies and mechanisms that achieves it, all it tends to do is crush business and investment confidence and cost jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think we should all be working together to create jobs, not cost them. \u201cAnd the government sets our overall emissions reduction targets. Ours have been consistent for many years now. What\u2019s more important is we\u2019re meeting them. Our 2020 targets, we will exceed by 369m tonnes of abatement and similarly we\u2019ll meet our 2030 targets. \u201cSo I think, you know, we all agree you need to take action on climate change and we\u2019re taking responsible and effective action.\u201d Australia\u2019s emissions have risen every year for the past four years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
