German travel company TUI are facing demands for compensation because a maid repeatedly interrupted a couple while they were having sex in their hotel room during a holiday in Cuba. The man and wife filed a lawsuit at a district court in Hanover seeking a refund because they said the maid walked in on two occasions while they were engaged in intercourse, even though they had a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign outside the door. They are seeking about $4,000 in damages from TUI. But TUI has said the hotel's failings only amounted to an \"inconvenience\" and did not warrant such high compensation. Inconveniencing may be one way of putting it, but embarrassing is surely another (unless you're a naturist, not uncommon in Germany we hear). Which is why, purely for scientific reasons of comparison, we want you to mail us your most embarrassing holiday moments. They can be as brief and as anonymous as you like, and please feel free to send photographs if your story just doesn't make sense without them. Indeed, we're guessing that, for some entries, a photograph will, as they say, speak 1,000 words. The best entry will win a Rough Guide of their choice and will be published on Friday February 28. Mail your entries here: travel.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk, and if you're in the office, remember not to blush in front of colleagues while you do it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
