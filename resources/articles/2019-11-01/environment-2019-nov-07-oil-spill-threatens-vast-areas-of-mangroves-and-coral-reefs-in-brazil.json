The Brazilian Navy, which has deployed 8,500 personnel, 30 ships and 17 aircraft in the cleanup operation, said this week that 4,200 tonnes of oil have been removed from beaches, amid fears by scientists that some has already entered the food chain. \u201cThere are still many indirect impacts that have not yet been properly shown,\u201d said Guilherme Dutra, director of Conservation International\u2019s marine programme in Brazil. \u201cThe risk of contamination of the food chain is very high, especially in areas directly affected.\u201d The government of President Jair Bolsonaro initially struggled to react to the spill, leaving volunteers to clean up. On Wednesday it staged Brazil\u2019s biggest-ever oil auction for ultra-deep-water rights, which raised $17bn (\u00a313bn) \u2013 a disappointing shortfall on the $26bn the government had hoped for. Mangroves and coral reefs are particularly vulnerable to damage, scientists said, and removing oil from them is a delicate, specialised and lengthy process. Detergents used to clean oil can damage coral reefs, and mangrove roots need to be cleaned manually. Brazil\u2019s government environment agency, Ibama, has counted 126 marine creatures affected \u2013 including 24 seabirds and 88 turtles \u2013 of which 95 had died, it said on Tuesday. Another 3,900 baby turtles had been captured by government agencies and universities and moved to safety. The Brazilian navy says the oil has reached the Abrolhos Marine national park off the coast of Bahia state \u2013 a reserve that includes an archipelago, extensive coral reefs, humpback whale breeding grounds and the South Atlantic\u2019s biggest concentration of marine biodiversity. Reef fish such as Scarus trispinosus \u2013 a vivid blue parrotfish known as Budi\u00e3o-azul in Portuguese \u2013 as well as Mussismilia corals could be endangered, said Dutra, a biologist who has worked extensively in Abrolhos. Flavio Lima, a professor of biology at the State University of Rio Grande do Norte in the north-east, said the oil could even prove fatal to the coral reefs. \u201cThe coral is not an organism, it is a colony and it is very sensitive to alterations in the composition of nutrients,\u201d he said. \u201cOil contamination could cause widespread death of coral colonies.\u201d Brazil\u2019s coastal mangrove forests are important reproduction centres for many species of fish, Lima said. \u201cThese mangrove areas are nurseries. We have the prolonged effects of the oil, that go from contamination of food sources like algae and invertebrates until [it reaches] the food chain \u2026 [The spill] also represents a risk for local populations who depend on crustaceans, like crabs and shrimp, and molluscs like oysters and clams, for survival.\u201d Brazil\u2019s state oil company, Petrobras, said the oil came from three Venezuelan fields. Last Friday Federal Police and the Brazilian navy said an oil tanker flying a Greek flag and carrying crude oil from Venezuela was the main suspect after satellite images showed it was the only ship near an oil slick spotted 700km off Brazil\u2019s north-east coast on 28-29 July, en route to South Africa. Delta Tankers, owners of the Bouboulina tanker since identified by Reuters as the ship concerned, has denied responsibility. The ship \u201csailed from Venezuela in laden condition on July 19 2019 heading directly, with no stops at other ports, for Melaka, Malaysia, where she discharged her entire cargo without any shortage\u201d, the company said in a statement. In a Facebook Live event last Friday alongside Bolsonaro, the fishing and agriculture secretary, Jorge Seif J\u00fanior, said there was no risk of contamination. \u201cThe fish is an intelligent animal. When it sees a blanket of oil, it flees,\u201d he said. Maur\u00edcio Cardim, 42, who rents boats to tourists and researchers in Bahia, said the evidence on the ground proved otherwise. \u201cI have seen dead fish, I have seen jellyfish\u2026 I have seen an enormous quantity of seaweed we don\u2019t see at this time of year, coloured with oil,\u201d said Cardim, who is part of the Coast Guardians group of volunteers who are cleaning up the coast of Bahia state. \u201cWe want a solution. For now we are cleaning our beaches, because we live from the sea.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
