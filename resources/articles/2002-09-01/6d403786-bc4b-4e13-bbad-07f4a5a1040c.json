Iain Duncan Smith said that the Prime Minister now had to tell the British people what he already knew - that Iraq was a clear and growing danger to the West and that the UK and the US had a clear common cause for concerted action. He said that Britain could be the target of any future attacks. 'It is now time for the Prime Minister to explain to the British people what he already knows - that Iraq is a clear and growing danger to Britain,' Duncan Smith said in an article in the Sunday Times . 'That will mean leading the public debate and arguing from real principles, using every opportunity to put the case including a debate in Parliament as soon as it returns [from the summer recess]. 'Those who believe we can simply do nothing must say how we would counter Saddam in the future when he has nuclear and biological weapons. Ultimately, the question is not whether we deal with Saddam, but when and how.' Duncan Smith said the world should not underestimate Saddam's determination to acquire weapons of mass destruction, and the means to deliver them across significant distances. 'The next generation of Iraqi missiles will be able to reach the whole of Europe as well as the Indian sub-continent. On top of that Saddam is just as likely to use terrorists to deliver such weapons.' Turning to the threat to Britain, Duncan Smith said the UK was a target. It was a member of the United Nations Security Council that had passed the resolutions leading up to the Gulf War, and British forces were engaged in military actions together with the US over the Iraqi no-fly zones."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
