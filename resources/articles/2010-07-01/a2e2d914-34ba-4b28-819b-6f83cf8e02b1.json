While admitting that a trip to the nearest gay bar might take two hours, the lobby group Stonewall says that Aberystwyth's relative isolation has encouraged an active gay and lesbian society to flourish on campus. The finding emerges in an online guide published today which measures more than 100 universities against a checklist that covers everything from whether they mention sexual orientation in their harassment policies to whether they organise special social events for gay and lesbian students. Aberpride, the Welsh university's gay society, provides a monthly social in one of the town's bars as well as a trip to Manchester and \"retail therapy\" in Swansea, the guide notes. The town has no gay-only venues; instead, social life revolves around \"beach-fire parties \u2026 providing much-needed warmth on cool evenings\". Gary Nunn, of Stonewall, said: \"Universities like Aberystwyth come off really well because of their LGBT society. Not having a major gay scene locally means they have developed the LGBT society to be very strong.\" Universities that score highly in the guide include Birmingham, Bradford, Cambridge and King's College London. Huddersfield and Teesside are among those that score poorly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
