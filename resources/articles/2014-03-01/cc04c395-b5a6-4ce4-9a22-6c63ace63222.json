Sevilla reach the last eight, after an evening in which this happened: Anzhi Makhachkala 0-0 AZ Alkmaar (agg 0-1) Benfica 2-2 Tottenham Hotspur (agg 5-3) Fiorentina 0-1 Juventus (agg 1-2) Napoli 2-2 FC Porto (agg 2-3) Plzen 2-1 Lyon (agg 3-5) Real Betis 0-2 Sevilla aet, 0-2 after 90 mins (agg 2-2, Sevilla win 4-3 on pens) Salzburg 1-2 Basle (agg 1-2) Valencia 1-0 Ludogorets (agg 4-0) \u201cI think we\u2019ve all over-indulged a little tonight,\u201d burps Simon McMahon. \u201cIn fact I feel sick.\u201d Nighty night, everyone! Oh no no no no no no no Nono! He takes a nonchalant swipe at the ball, and sends a pathetic effort rolling left of the target! Poor lad\u2019s in tears, but that was appalling. Sevilla win 4-3 on penalties! The fifth kicks: Rakitic strokes his into the right-hand side of the net. Now Nono has to score to keep his team in it! Can he? ... The fourth kicks: Everyone\u2019s firing them into the top right! Moreno puts his there, though not quite as impressively as what\u2019s gone before. N\u2019Diaye for Betis now... and his effort hammers onto the left-hand post and out! That sprung off the inside, it wasn\u2019t the worst miss you\u2019ll ever see. All square! Sevilla 3-3 Betis. The third kicks: Gameiro follows Castro\u2019s lead, a thumper into the top right. Amaya, the Betis captain, fires one there too! Sevilla 2-3 Betis. The second kicks: Coke is the real thing: he slots it to the right, Adan going the other way. Sevilla for Betis puts his into the top left. Another brilliant one! Sevilla 1-2 Betis. The first kicks: Vitolo goes low right, and passes it straight at Adan! Weak and easy to save. Castro roofs an unstoppable one into the top right. As good a spot kick as you\u2019ll ever see! Sevilla 0-1 Betis The penalties, then! After an effing age - and, rather nicely, a lot of friendly and respectful handshakes between the two teams - it\u2019s on! Sevilla will take the first kick. Thou still unravished bride of quietness, Thou foster child of silence and slow time, Sylvan historian, who canst thus express A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme: What leaf-fringed legend haunts about thy shape Of deities or mortals, or of both, In Tempe or the dales of Arcady? What men or gods are these? What maidens loath? What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape? What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy? Penalties it is. Not a lot happening. I could type up a little filler in an attempt to keep y\u2019all interested ... but no. This is what it is. Think of it as art imitating art, like Ode on a Grecian Urn. You could call it Ode on Indolence, only Keats is ahead of us with that one, too. And we\u2019re off again! This is almost certainly going to go to penalties. That absurd stramash towards the end of the first period apart, fear has frozen these rivals. It\u2019s worth pointing out, I guess, if anyone\u2019s still reading, which I very much doubt, that another goal for Sevilla will count as a third away goal, and put Betis in all sorts of bother. How on earth have Sevilla failed to score here? A one-two down the inside-left channel releases Gameiro into the area. He\u2019s only got Adan to beat, but batters his shot straight at the keeper, who parries. The ball balloons up for Bacca, who attempts to head home from a couple of yards, but can\u2019t get enough purchase on the thing - allowing Adan to spring up and make another save! It\u2019s Bacca\u2019s last act of the day, because he\u2019s managed to break himself in the process of missing that gilt-edged chance. To round off a hapless minute for Sevilla, the substitute Sampeiro, coming on for Bacca, is booked for taking to the pitch too early! What a circus. It\u2019s all over for Salzburg all right. Basle make it through to the quarters, joining Juventus, Valencia, Lyon, Alkmaar, Porto and Benfica. One place left. Who\u2019s going to take it? Betis or Sevilla? There\u2019s been bugger all happening in extra time at the Estadio Benito Villamar\u00edn, so we\u2019re no nearer to knowing. If it wasn\u2019t already over in Salzburg, it is now. It\u2019s ten men apiece, with the dullest sounding footballer of all time - Alan - getting his marching orders for a second bookable offence. The final insult of an injurious evening for Salzburg. Extra time in Seville, then. In an ideal world, I\u2019d continue the menu riff that\u2019s run throughout this report: starter, main, pudding. But after over five hours of wall-to-wall Europa League action, I\u2019m too tired to think right now. Thankfully, Simon McMahon is on hand to do my riffing for me. \u201cThink I\u2019ll need a digestif after all that. Limoncello and coke?\u201d Sounds just the ticket, Simon. Have you got a rolled-up \u00a310 note? To slurp up the sticky booze, obviously. And we\u2019re still going in Salzburg, where even kidney-bothering quantities of taurine would be unlikely to assist the home side in their quest to reach the quarters. They\u2019re still 2-1 down, requiring two goals in the last ten minutes of this delayed game to turn things round. They\u2019ve been playing against ten men for almost the entire game, with little to show for it other than disappointment. And that\u2019s your lot in Italy, where Porto once again reach the latter stages of Europe\u2019s secondary trophy. Another free kick for Betis, just to the left of the D! Sevilla hits the wall again, uselessly, and that is that. It\u2019ll be extra time in Seville! Callejon springs the Porto defence down the right, enters the box, and fires into the centre, where Zapata can\u2019t miss from six yards. There\u2019s 120 seconds of added time left, but this is too little, too late. Erstwhile Chelsea gaffer Rafa Benitez won\u2019t be winning two Europa Leagues on the bounce. ... batters an idiotic shot straight into the coupon of some poor bugger standing in the wall. What a clown. This\u2019ll be extra time. A last-minute chance for Betis, as Ruben Castro is bundled over as he makes for the Sevilla box. The free kick is 25 yards out, just to the left of the target. If this goes in, Betis have redeemed themselves at the death and will be in the quarters. The confusingly named Salvador Sevilla steps up, and ... So here\u2019s where we are at the business end of the evening: Betis 0-2 Sevilla (agg 2-2) Napoli 1-2 Porto (agg 1-3) Salzburg 1-2 Basle (agg 1-2) Still plenty of time to go in the final game, about 20 minutes or so thanks to that flare-based hold-up in the first half. The other matches are into their final five minutes. Napoli are jiggered, Porto are through. But it\u2019s all to play for in the Seville derby. Well this suddenly got a lot more dramatic, didn\u2019t it. I should probably have been more patient. And it\u2019s looking all over for Salzburg, too, as ten-man Basle turn it round! Last year\u2019s semi-finalists, conquerors of Spurs before being tonked by Chelsea, have one foot in the last eight again! You have to search out this goal. Quaresma tiptoes his way past three challenges in double-quick time on the right-hand edge of the Napoli box. He then lifts an unstoppable riser into the top right! That\u2019s Porto 3-1 up on aggregate, and the home side need four goals to progress. This is over! Moreno rips down the left and fires a low ball into the area. Bacca, meeting the ball first time in the middle of the area, sidefoots home, a proper ice-hockey slapshot. A brilliant finish! And this tie is all level, and going to extra time as things stand! Another sucker punch, this time in Salzburg! The home team are a man up, but they\u2019re behind in the tie on away goals now! \u201cLong shifts, talk of sand-wedges, \u2018leaderboard\u2019 updates,\u201d notes Simon McMahon. \u201cNext you\u2019ll be telling us that Adam Scott has gone round in 62 at Bay Hill.\u201d He\u2019s a step ahead, kids, a step ahead. Not a bad day for the reigning Masters champion, that. And there\u2019s his green-jacketed predecessor Bubba Watson shooting 83 as well. I\u2019ve already got Augusta Fever. You too? You too, huh. And now Defour whacks a low shot onto the base of Napoli\u2019s left-hand post! The home support have fallen into a silent funk, and no wonder: they\u2019ve been the dominant side, but what a sucker punch that was! Good old precarious European football, and no mistake! Jackson Martinez is clattered in the centre circle by Behrami. It should be a free kick, but the referee waves play on, allowing Fernando to shuttle the ball down the inside right channel for Ghilas. The Algerian, only recently thrown on, smacks a confident low effort into the bottom right past the despairing arm of Reina! Napoli need to score twice now! No goals since the 22nd minute at Salzburg. It\u2019s not been the greatest night, has it? Mind you, this Napoli-Porto game is cooking nicely: while the hosts are in the ascendancy, and pushing to land the killer blow, a goal on the break for the Portuguese side will change everything. Good old precarious European football! Napoli back on the front foot again. First Higuain springs the Porto back line down the inside right, his low shot bundled out of play on the right by two white-shirted defenders plus their keeper. Then Inler flashes a header from the corner straight at Fabiano. And finally Ghoulam flicks the ball down the left to free Mertens, whose hammer from a tight angle is parried clear by the keeper. Napoli well on top. Surely it\u2019s only a matter of time? Porto show upfield for the first time in a wee while, Carlos Eduardo meeting a left-wing free kick by flicking a header towards the bottom right. It flew just wide of the target, and Reina had that covered, though he moved across with the insouciance that sometimes sees him standing around impotently as balls flash into his net. Insigne nearly scores from a tight angle on the left, but the ball\u2019s battered out of play for a corner by the upstanding Fabiano. (Though it\u2019s then pulled back for Pandev, who hilariously blazes over from six yards, the goal gaping.) Ghoulam tries to curl a shot into the top right, and he\u2019s not far off at all. That would have been a spectacular strike. Half-time in Salzburg, where this sort of stuff ... ... found its way onto the pitch, hence the delay of roughly 15 minutes. The home side lead 1-0, and are a man to the good, so they\u2019re hot favourites to be going through this evening. The first act of the second half in Naples, and Danilo slices an appalling clearance back out for a corner. That\u2019s dealt with, but then Henrique bombs down the right and nearly finds Higuain in the centre with a low cross. Napoli are on the front foot from the off, picking up where the first half ended. And we\u2019re off again in Naples and Seville! And we\u2019re still going in the first half at Salzburg, but to hell with that! A wonderful moment during ITV\u2019s half-time analysis. Presenter Matt Smith points out that Napoli have fashioned four times as many chances despite only enjoying 33% possession. Gordon Strachan, experiencing patience-snapping boredom, responds with a tired sigh, hissing \u201cAch! Stats! Stats!\u201d and instead proceeding to eulogise Napoli\u2019s pretty play. Oh Gordon! How could you! It\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re saying sport should be enjoyed as an aesthetic and visceral treat, a bit of fun, rather than homework to be mapped out on Excel spreadsheets and studied with a haughty sniff! Half-time entertainment: The game\u2019s restarted in Salzburg, but never mind that, it\u2019s half time in both Naples and Seville. As things stand, the Napoli-Porto tie is going to extra time, whereas Real Betis would join Juventus, Alkmaar, Lyon and Valencia in the quarter-final pot. Salzburg are in there too, but that one\u2019s running behind schedule now. A lull. Lovely lull. Napoli are fully on top. Insigne cuts inside from the left and ripples the side netting with a low fizzer. That was only an inch or two away from nestling in the bottom-left corner. Higuain, to the right of the centre circle, rakes a high diagonal ball towards Mertens, breaking into the box. He meets the pass first time, blootering a low shot straight at Fabiano. It\u2019s a decent effort, but a shame he didn\u2019t connect properly, because that would have been a goal for the picture books. The game between Salzburg and Basel has been halted, with some clowns throwing missiles onto the pitch. For goodness sake. \u201cPorto are rocking a little bit \u2018cos Villas-Boas just snatched our goalkeeper\u2019s coach,\u201d reports Tiago Carreira. \u201cFor a man who used to profess his undying love for Porto he sure has a way to prove it.\u201d He\u2019s got a way with fans that\u2019d put the ever-popular Michael Owen to shame. And now Porto nearly score. A corner down the right. Jackson Martinez meets it, ten yards out, and heads towards the top left. Reina doesn\u2019t have it covered, diving late, but the ball drifts just wide of the post. Porto are putting the collective foot in tonight. Mangala nearly kicks Albiol\u2019s foot clean off the end of his leg. Free kick, in the Porto D. Insigne hits the ball straight at the wall, but then benefits from a pinball ricochet which releases Mertens into the area down the left channel! He whipcracks a low shot goalwards, but Fabiano starjumps to smother. Next to nothing happens all evening, then three goals in three delicately poised ties, all at once. It was always going to happen like this. So here\u2019s how we stand everywhere: Betis 0-1 Sevilla (agg 2-1) Napoli 1-0 Porto (agg 1-1) Salzburg 1-0 Basel (agg 1-0) It could be a long night. It\u2019s already been a long night. A brilliant finish by the former Arsenal star here! Gameiro romps down the left and slides a pass into the area. Reyes meets it first time, coming in from the right, and sends it back the other way, sidefooting it brilliantly into the bottom left! Sevilla have halved the deficit against their city rivals! Higuain, down the inside left channel, draws two defenders before rolling a little ball forward and into the area for Pandev, who chips a delicate first-time effort over the advancing Fabiano. We\u2019re level in this tie at 1-1, and Napoli\u2019s dander is up! No goals yet in any of our three matches. Quaresma has clattered Mertens on the shin. No action from the referee, but that should have been a yellow, the Napoli man has a red criss-cross pattern all down his leg. He\u2019s got a gingham shin! Insigne sand-wedges a lovely ball down the inside-left channel. Higuain chases after it, and is clear in the area! But he\u2019s tempted into scoring a stunner by the dropping ball, and attempts to loop it over the keeper with a first-time volley, instead of trapping and battering it home. What a chance spurned! An early red card in the Salzburg-Basel game. Marek Suchy has been sent packing for play most foul. Meanwhile in Naples, Henrique chases after a Mertens header down the inside right, and flashes a gorgeous shot just wide of the left-hand post. Not sure Fabiano had that covered were it heading for the bottom-left corner. Stunning effort. It\u2019s a pretty open game, with Mertens, Pandev and Higuain all causing Porto early bother, while Quaresma has make a couple of inroads down the other end. Napoli scream for a penalty as Ghoulam goes down under a challenge from Unidentified Porto Player - but the referee, the Premier League\u2019s Martin Atkinson no less, isn\u2019t having any of it. A decent enough decision. A fairly scrappy start at the Stadio San Paolo, where there\u2019s plenty of the old whistling going on whenever the white-shirted Porto get hold of the ball. Napoli, trailing by the single goal from the leg in Oporto, are of course in their powdery blue kit, which to the mind\u2019s eye will always have Mars blazoned across the front of it, and Himself rushing about in it with much determination and not a little skill. Right, we\u2019re going to concentrate on the Napoli-Porto game, and you\u2019ll like it too. But I will try my best to keep an eye on what\u2019s going in the Seville derby, as the home side Betis attempt to keep a hold of their 2-0 first-leg lead.

That brouhaha - a Howard Webb cock-up, who\u2019d have thought? - was the last act of the match. Juve go through to the finals, a deserved victory against a side that, after a fast start, didn\u2019t really do much. A feisty end to the game, with Tevez chasing a loose ball into the Fiorentina area and stands on the goalkeeper Neto\u2019s head. Neto isn\u2019t happy, and forceful enough in his arguments that he\u2019s booked. As is Tevez - who really should see red, as the Juve striker definitely clanked his boot onto the keeper\u2019s neep. There was no need for that, a deliberate move downwards that really didn\u2019t have to happen that way. Vidal, on the penalty spot, meeting a right-wing cross and facing an open goal, heads wide. What a ridiculously inept miss! Stefan Savi\u0107, prone to many an error in his time at Manchester City, still has a strain of haplessness in his game; that Juve move began when Asamoah stormed into acres of space, latching onto a lazy blind pass from the defender. Alberto Aquilani latches onto a loose ball and sends a first-time daisycutter towards the bottom-right corner of the Juve goal. But he\u2019s too far out, and it\u2019s not hit with enough venom to trouble a keeper like Gianluigi Buffon. A real sense that this is over, the Comunale is in a rare old collective funk. Stephan Lichtsteiner should have put Juventus out of sight. He wins a pinball battle with Savic down the Juve right, and races clear towards the area. His low fizzer towards the bottom right is decent, but turned round the post by Neto, who should never have been given the chance of making a save. Time\u2019s running out for Fiorentina, who have six minutes to find the goal that\u2019d force extra time. Is a preposterous comeback on for Tottenham? Have they really just hit Benfica with a double-whammy that leaves them searching for just the one goal to take the match, unbelievably, into extra time? Don\u2019t ask me, I\u2019m not scabbing, this is Simon Burnton\u2019s patch! Llorente fires a header straight at Neto from point-blank range. Then Pirlo nearly scores from the halfway line, but his cheeky effort is overcooked, flying over the bar to a soundtrack of affronted whistles from the home support. This is all Juve, with the home side visibly deflated after the Rodriguez sending off and its terrible implications. A little bit of detail on the Makhachkala-Alkmaar game. AZ\u2019s Nemanja Gudelj hit the post with a free kick on 33 minutes; AZ nearly scored with a 20-yard piledriver from Aron Johannsson - whose penalty decided the first leg - just after the break; and Anzhi\u2019s Karlen Mkrtchyan saw red for a foul on Steven Berghuis in injury time. It ended 0-0, and the Dutch go through. Pirlo, after a false start, takes a second run up and curls a stunning free kick into the top right at extreme pace! All of a sudden, this match has been turned on its head! And as things stand, Juve will be in the quarters! Incidentally, it appears Rodriguez was indeed shown a second yellow, hence the red, not that it makes much difference to the here and now. RED CARD IN FLORENCE! Suddenly, with 21 minutes remaining, silence! The home captain Gonzalo Rodriguez, already in the book, is turned by Llorente on the edge of the Fiorentina D. Rodriguez sticks out a leg to cheesewire his man down - and that\u2019s a straight red, never mind a second yellow! Fiorentina down to ten, and this is a free kick in a very dangerous position, especially as Pirlo will be the man taking it. ... this! Two goals in 120 seconds, and the Czechs have turned this tie around. Bounced back, if you will. They\u2019re still 5-3 behind on aggregate, though with nearly half an hour remaining, an astonishing and quite frankly unlikely comeback suddenly looks possible! First this. And then ... A Pirlo corner from the right. On the edge of the six-yard box, Pogba attempts an overhead kick from quite a low height. He catches the ball well enough, but sends it well wide left from close range. Italy\u2019s dominant team are getting a little bit desperate here, with 25 minutes to go. The Spaniards go 4-0 up on aggregate. If this tie wasn\u2019t over already, it is now. Isla stands up a cross from the Juve right. It\u2019s got the backpedalling Fiorentina defence all at sea, but Vidal somehow heads over from six yards. What a chance to take the lead for Juventus! They\u2019re the better side here now. Cuadrado sends a swerving shot towards Buffon after a rangy run down the right wing. It poses the Juve keeper quite a test, but he\u2019s up to the job, parrying spectacularly. Meanwhile here\u2019s a reader complaint from Mac Millings: \u201cThis is a family website, Scott, and no place to announce filth like, \u2018That\u2019s loosened the beads on my rusty abacus\u2019.\u201d Just as well I wasn\u2019t furiously fingering the sticky buttons down the front of my Little Professor. There are four games on the go at the moment. Here are the latest scores: Benfica 1-0 Tottenham (agg 4-1) Fiorentina 0-0 Juventus (agg 1-1) Plzen 0-1 Lyon (agg 1-5) Valencia 0-0 Ludogorets (agg 3-0) Eagle-eyed readers will note that three of these ties are already as good as over. More please, Uefa! Juve are on the front foot at the start of the second half, picking up pretty much where they left off. Tevez goes on a determined skitter down the inside-right channel, and sends a deflected shot spooning over the bar from a tight-ish angle. Nothing comes of the resulting set piece. So, something happened in Russia, but it was only Karlen Mkrtchyan of Anzhi Makhachkala getting himself sent off for a professional foul right at the death. Dick Advocaat\u2019s side are therefore the first into the hat for the quarter-final draw! There\u2019s one! On the stroke of half-time, too. Lyon go in at the break 5-1 up on aggregate. That\u2019s loosened the beads on my rusty abacus. It\u2019s half time in Florence! The score\u2019s 0-0. It\u2019s 0-0 in Valencia, too, though let\u2019s face it, that tie\u2019s already wrapped up. More please, Uefa! Tevez whips a shot straight down Neto\u2019s throat from 25 yards. That was fired with such force that, a yard either side, Juventus were celebrating the opening goal. A couple of phases later, and Caceres is attempting an ambitious shot from a tight angle on the right. His effort bothers the side netting, but nothing else. There\u2019s been a goal! But still there\u2019s no opportunity for me to get out the orange text generator, because it\u2019s come in the Benfica-Spurs game, and Simon Burnton is all over that. I\u2019ll not break NUJ regulations by duplicating his work for free over here, the man\u2019s got to put bread on the table. Bugger all, it would seem. It\u2019s 0-0 in all five games being played right now. Pogba is a fine player. How Manchester United could do with him these days. He lashes a low shot goalwards from 20 yards, though it\u2019s straight at Neto. Still 0-0 here, and as things stand, it\u2019s Fiorentina heading into the quarter finals. Long way to go, of course. Here, what\u2019s happening in the other games? Pizarro, 25 yards out to the right of goal, chests the ball down and threads a lovely volley a millimetre or so wide of Juve\u2019s left-hand post. Buffon wasn\u2019t getting to that. So close. \u201cI dread to think what Daniel Stauss (5.52pm) might do when he finds out that there\u2019s a pork chop, black pudding and tattie scone underneath those fried eggs,\u201d worries Simon McMahon. I know. Perhaps replace the black pudding with the mealy variety? There\u2019s a bit of onion in mealy chud, he might be happier if we\u2019ve added the continental taste of vegetable to the plate. And another chance for Pogba! He hammers a downwards header from a right-wing cross straight at Neto from six yards. Fiorentina hack the loose ball clear, and it transpires Pogba had run offside anyway, but the Serie A champions are beginning to turn the screw here. Juve were so close to opening the scoring. They\u2019ve been slowly moving into the ascendency, and when Pogba, bombing along the left channel, chested down a looping pass and broke into the box, danger loomed for the home side. But with only Neto to beat, he flicked his shot straight across the face of goal and out on the right. Juventus getting themselves back into this game, a little, Tevez guiding a lame effort wide right of the target. But the home side will be happy with the way they\u2019ve started here. It\u2019s up to Juve to force the issue, of course, having conceded the away goal in the first leg. The Old Lady is also second best aesthetically, despite the crisp and simple brilliance of her classic black-and-white-striped shirt. No shame in that, because Fiorentina\u2019s colours are the prettiest in world football, aren\u2019t they? Juventus are all over the shop here! Cuadrado is in acres of space down the right, and his low cross fizzes straight through the Juve six-yard box, begging to be tapped in. But there\u2019s no violet shirt waiting to convert. What a ball that was! All Fiorentina in the first couple of minutes, with Ilicic dragging a low shot wide right of Buffon\u2019s goal, then Gomez spurning a wonderful chance as he races down the inside-left channel and screws a dismal effort across the face of goal and wide right, when it was surely easier to make it 1-0! The atmosphere at the Comunale is amazing, as you\u2019d imagine it would be. Everyone\u2019s high on art. Right, finally we\u2019ve got something to sink our teeth into, with the 6pm kick-offs about to start. I\u2019ll be concentrating on the action in the Renaissance city of Florence, where home heroes Fiorentina face down hated rivals Juventus. This should be a cracking game: Juve were the better side for about 60 minutes of the first leg in Turin, before Fiorentina got their act together and bossed the latter stages. That game ended 1-1, and though Juve remain favourites to progress despite being held at home, they\u2019ll be rather worried, given this was the scene of their only defeat in Serie A this season so far. Anyway, it\u2019s on! It\u2019s half-time at the Anzhi-Arena, where it\u2019s goalless between the home side Anzhi Makhachkala and visitors AZ Alkmaar. \u201cTwo fried eggs on top of a pile of french fries, with baked beans on the side and mystery brown sauce up top?\u201d splutters difficult customer Daniel Stauss. \u201cBritish \u2018cuisine\u2019 is almost entirely dare-based, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m guessing that particular taste sensation has some sort of colloquial or possibly regional name, but I\u2019ve been put so far off by that picture that I can\u2019t be bothered to find it.\u201d I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019re coming from here, Daniel. There\u2019s nothing mysterious about that sauce. The clue is in the colour. It\u2019s brown sauce! Mm, the delicious, spicy tang of brown. It\u2019s the taste! You\u2019re not going to leave a tip, are you? Breaking news from Russia! Apparently in the 12th minute of play, AZ won a corner. Steven Berghuis took it, but nothing much came of it. The ups and downs of live blogging, right here. \u201cThe main item of note in this match so far is that the pitch is a suspiciously luminous shade of green, which is making my eyes hurt,\u201d reports the unfortunate but very dependable Philippa Booth. \u201cI will keep you posted on any other critical developments.\u201d We\u2019ll be hearing from Philippa again at around 6.45pm GMT.

Consider this preamble an amuse-bouche, or perhaps a taint-free glass of room-temperature water to cleanse the palate. As for what represents the cheeseboard, coffee, petits fours, and digestifs, I don\u2019t know. I might have a tin of lager on the train home, you\u2019ll have to sort yourselves out.
