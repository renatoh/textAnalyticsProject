Campbell, like Hendry, has always used the same cue and does not have a replacement. Few players do since each cue plays differently when off-centre striking is required. He immediately consulted Trevor White, the Bridgend cue doctor who last April restored Mark Williams' cue for what proved to be a successful world title challenge. The butt half of Campbell's two-piece is little affected but the vital tip half appears beyond repair. Tightened airline security in the aftermath of September 11 has meant cues can no longer be carried as hand luggage. \"I asked the flight attendant but after conferring with a colleague she said it had to go in the hold with the other luggage,\" said Campbell, the world No56 from Dumbarton. \"It was in a steel case and marked fragile but something really heavy must have fallen on it.\" His chances of denying the world No4 John Higgins a place in the last 16 tomorrow must now be regarded as virtually non-existent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
