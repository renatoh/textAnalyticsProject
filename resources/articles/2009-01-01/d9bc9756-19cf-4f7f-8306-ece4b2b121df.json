Back then the Brazilian detected a squad of world-class players in search of a leader and expected the riches of Roman Abramovich to remain on tap for a little considered remedial work. What he did not envisage was the cascade of problems that has ensued. Money for just one transfer of his choosing. None for a January when his squad are in obvious need of attacking reinforcement. A swathe of cutbacks on club expenditure that has irritated his players. Two ruptured cruciate ligaments plus a series of intermittent injuries that have affected almost every one of Chelsea's stellar names. And a group of players who compare his managerial moves with a trophy-winning predecessor. There are difficulties in every game, set-piece goals conceded aplenty plus a worrying inability to brush aside lower-league opposition. Burnley have won here, Southend United drawn here and yesterday Ipswich Town came back from a goal down to fray Chelsea nerves once more. If two second-half free-kicks of unquestionable quality saw Scolari's team into the FA Cup's fifth round, they did not appear a team set fair to win that trophy. \"I thought we gave a right good account of ourselves,\" said Ipswich manager Jim Magilton correctly. \"Scored a good set-piece goal and with one or two moments where with more care on the ball could have had even more.\" Nought of any genuine concern, argued Ray Wilkins, after assuring us that Scolari \"doesn't feel under pressure at all\". \"They did have a good spell, but we weren't too worried,\" said the Brazilian's assistant. \"We've had similar circumstances with Burnley this year, Southend made it very tough for us, and this was always going to be exactly the same. But you're not too worried when you think of the quality we have. There was always going to be a period when we'd take hold of the game and create some chances.\" For all Scolari's efforts to preach spirit over style, there was an early inertia to his team. Passes drifted astray \u2013 notably when Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa initiated an Ipswich attack that culminated in a free header for Danny Haynes \u2013 and the attack operated as individuals, not a unit. In their favour was the visitors' unadulterated ambition; Jim Magilton taking 4-4-2 Championship shape to the Bridge and opening the midfield to Chelsea. On the quarter-hour, space was converted into advantage as Frank Lampard passed perceptively beyond Ipswich's right-back and Ashley Cole squared first time for a sliding Michael Ballack to score. The comfort of the finish, unfortunately, spread to his team. Chelsea decelerated, content to hold possession and pick their shots from outside the area. Loose passes proliferated and ill-considered tackles ceded free-kicks. From one, David Wright curled the ball into a phalanx of static markers, its ricochet falling for Alex Bruce to shoot past Cech. Though Florent Malouda almost found an immediate reply, Chelsea remained susceptible. Sprinting away from a home attack, Owen Garvan and Jon Walters teed up Haynes for a strike the winger should have kept under the crossbar. Chelsea responded with more long-range shots. Their predictability was broken by the return of Didier Drogba from two matches of first-team exclusion. The striker's mood improved by the knowledge that Manchester City valued him enough to offer to double his \u00a391,000-a-week wages, his first touches worked Nicolas Anelka towards the Ipswich penalty area, where the Frenchman was halted by Garvan. Ballack assessed the distance and lifted the free-kick over wall and into top corner. A couple of strong Ipswich chances and a tweaked Ricardo Carvalho hamstring later, Drogba won a set piece himself \u2013 Lampard converting from 35 yards with an audacity to match Ballack's elegance. The relief, you fear, may be temporary."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
