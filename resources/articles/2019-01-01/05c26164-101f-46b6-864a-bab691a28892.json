For the first time since taking over at Stamford Bridge six months ago, Sarri felt compelled to revert to his native Italian and lean on an interpreter to express his exasperation at a defeat which means Chelsea\u2019s lead over Arsenal and Manchester United has been cut to only three points. The head coach suggested he wanted to make his \u201cmessage very clear, without mistakes with my English\u201d before ripping into his team\u2019s shot-shy display. Chelsea\u2019s first shot on target did not come until the 82nd minute, from Marcos Alonso. \u201cI have to say that I\u2019m extremely angry, very angry indeed,\u201d he said. \u201cThis defeat was due to our mentality more than anything else, our mental approach. We played against a team which, mentally, was far more determined than we were. And this is something I can\u2019t accept. We had a similar issue in the league game at Tottenham [a 3-1 defeat in November]. We spoke a great deal about that loss and our approach at the time, and I spoke to the players, and I thought we\u2019d overcome this issue. \u201cBut it appears we still seem to lack sufficient motivation, being mentally solid and determination. So I\u2019m not happy, I\u2019m really not happy. I\u2019d prefer to be in the changing room, speaking to the players, to talk about why we lost from a tactical point of view. But the fact of the matter is it appears this group of players are extremely difficult to motivate. When you see this kind of game, when one team is quite obviously more determined than the other, you can\u2019t really talk about tactics. From a technical point of view both teams are pretty much on the same level, but Arsenal were more determined. Tactics don\u2019t come into it. \u201cTheir high level of determination was obvious throughout, particularly in both penalty areas. If you think about their determination and how clinical they were when they scored the goals, in defence we stood off a lot and we were not determined and not strong enough. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, we could have lost that game anyway, but we could have lost it for tactical reasons. We lost it because of our determination. I couldn\u2019t possibly say I am not responsible as well, in part at least, for the mental approach. That\u2019s something we have to share.\u201d Sarri, who hopes to add the Juventus striker Gonzalo Higua\u00edn to his options before the second leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final against Spurs on Thursday, has been critical of his players\u2019 attitude at times this season, suggesting they can be guilty of complacency when ahead in matches. But the Italian remains uncertain how to instil more motivation into the group. \u201cIt seems to me that, as a group of players, they\u2019re not particularly aggressive from a mental point of view,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have that ferocity in their mentality. That\u2019s down to the type of players they are, their characteristics. \u201cIt\u2019s something that is difficult to change. You have to try and influence their mentality and it could take quite a long time, or, by the same token, it could be changed with a new player coming in or one of the old heads in the team assuming more responsibility and driving the rest of the team forward.\u201d Asked if he remains the right man to oversee Chelsea\u2019s progression, he added: \u201cYes, absolutely. I\u2019m very aware this is never going to be a team well known for its battling and fighting qualities. From a technical point of view, those aren\u2019t the characteristics that we have. But what we need to become is a team capable of adapting, a team that can perhaps suffer for 10-15 minutes during the game but then play our own football. \u201cToday we didn\u2019t play our own football. Our defending ended up with us running backwards rather than pressing high up the pitch. We are a team that should be playing one or two touches. Instead at some stages we were playing with seven or eight. This is the sort of thing I don\u2019t want to happen. We are going to have to try and change that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
