Their confidence came in large part from a $4bn project to read mankind's genetic code. The Human Genome Project promised to be a feeding frenzy for scientists. By laying bare the six billion letters of our genetic make-up, they would gain unprecedented insight into what makes us human, and what defects cause disease. A draft of the human genetic code was published in 2001, but just as important were the resulting advances in genetic sequencing technology. The cost of reading a patient's genome fell dramatically, and by 2007 scientists were able to link specific genes to diabetes, arthritis, bipolar disorder, high blood pressure and obesity. With these comes the potential to develop screening programmes to identify early on those who are most at risk. Modern genetics gave rise to a surge in \"paleogenetics\", the study of ancient DNA. Research in the field saw scientists reconstruct the genetic code of the woolly mammoth in 2008, and our Neanderthal cousins earlier this year. The other major development was stem cells. Embryonic stem cells \u2013 as opposed to those taken from adults \u2013 can grow into any tissue in the body. The tantalising prospect is to use them to regenerate diseased and damaged tissues. Ethical and religious concerns over the provenance of embryonic stem cells hampered the research, but in 2007 Shinya Yamanaka in Japan side-stepped the problem by creating stem cells from adult skin cells. Clinical trials for treating diseases, and even injuries, are planned for the near future. As the decade played out, a new kind of biology emerged. Scientists learned to manipulate cellular machinery with exquisite precision. In 2002, researchers in New York created a synthetic polio virus. In 2005, scientists with the US military recreated the 1918 Spanish flu virus. They now plan to create rudimentary life from scratch. Biology has advanced rapidly and dramatically in the last 10 years. The progress will undoubtedly usher in improved medical treatments and a better understanding of the mechanisms of life. But as with all fast-moving science, that progress goes hand in hand with new social and ethical concerns."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
