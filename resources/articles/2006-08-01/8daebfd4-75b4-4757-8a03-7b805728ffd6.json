Newcastle had appealed against a decision by the HMRC, formerly Customs &amp; Excise, which had prevented the club from reclaiming VAT on agents' fees. However, the most fascinating insight came in Newcastle's submissions. The club provided documentary evidence on Newcastle's activities involving agents, and the enormous sums paid to middlemen in negotiations of transfers and player contracts. Over a 32-month period to January 2004, Newcastle dispensed with more than \u00a33.5m in agents' fees and associated VAT payments. One set of invoices over the 18 months between May 17, 2002 and November 1, 2003, demanded \u00a3775,500 in fees and VAT on behalf of Stellar Group, the agency run by Jonathan Barnett. The fees pertained to the contract renegotiation for a single player, identified in the tribunal verdict only as \"Silver\". The north-east club's dealings with Stellar, who represent Newcastle players such as Kieron Dyer and Titus Bramble, made the agency the biggest earner over the period. In December 2001, another invoice for \u00a350,000 plus VAT was lodged for the transfer of \"Gold\" to St James' Park. The transfer of \"Green\" saw Stellar request separate payments on November 1 in 2002 and 2003 of \u00a380,000 and \u00a390,000 respectively. VAT was requested on top. But Stellar were not the sole agents acting for the club's players. Proactive, for whom Paul Stretford is the highest-profile director, invoiced them for \u00a3100,000 plus VAT in July 2002 for the transfer out of Newcastle of a player known as \"Yellow\". The ISM sports-management group also invoiced for \u00a350,000 plus VAT for the same transfer, only 12 months after demanding \u00a375,000 plus VAT for taking the same player to the club. It is not only the corporate agencies who drew large sums from Newcastle. David Giess, who represents former Newcastle players such as Lee Bowyer through his firm Skillequal Ltd, invoiced for \u00a3300,000 for arranging the free transfer of \"Red\" in May 2003. Newcastle's expenditure was exposed after it appealed against a previous decision that had left the club unable to reclaim \u00a3547,440 from the taxmanfor the period between April 2001 and January 2004. A spokeswoman for the club did not respond to calls last night. The verdict could lead to multi-million pound liabilities for Premiership clubs in respect of VAT erroneously reclaimed on agents' fees. Newcastle's transfer activity continues. Yesterday they completed the \u00a310m transfer of Obafemi Martins from Internazionale after the striker passed a medical and signed a five-year contract."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
