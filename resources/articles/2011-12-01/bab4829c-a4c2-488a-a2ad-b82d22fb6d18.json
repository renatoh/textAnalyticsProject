The Army's motto is Blood And Fire but it took Crystal Palace and Birmingham City almost the full 90 minutes to produce much of either. Not that the shivering Santa Clauses in the Holmesdale Road End cared as Kagisho Dikgacoi's fine header from a Darren Ambrose cross on 84 minutes provided the game's only goal from one of its few clear-cut chances. Not that Dougie Freedman minded either way. \"It was a very pleasing display, a very gutsy display,\" Palace's manager said afterwards, lauding both his goalscorer and the delivery of Ambrose (\"the best crosser of a ball in this division\"). \"We're a hard-working team that's come from the bottom. Everyone understands the game plan. We're not big stars. Everyone here is in this together.\" This was a meeting of two teams in a period of pre-Christmas retrenchment, the momentum of fine starts in the Championship dissipated slightly among grander distractions \u2013 for Palace the Carling Cup, for City the now curtailed Europa League campaign. The visitors began brightly enough, though, passing the ball neatly if with limited attacking thrust. Chris Hughton had sent his team out in a4-4-1-1 formation, with Chris Burke occupying an unusual loitering inside-right position, from which he provided a few moments of early danger. The first real chance came on 19 minutes, Stephen Carr creating space on the right with a dainty spin before crossing for Marlon King to shoot over the bar. Moments later the promising left-winger Nathan Redmond cut inside with quick feet from the left and hit a skidding shot that bounced off Juli\u00e1n Speroni's chest for a corner. Keith Fahey's kick was headed goalwards by Guirane N'Daw and volleyed over from three yards by the stretching Curtis Davies. On 23 minutes Palace finally showed their attacking teeth, Mile Jedinak unleashing a stinging half-volley from 25 yards that Boaz Myhill palmed away. And six minutes later they produced a moment of real class, the excellent Nathaniel Clyne galloping elegantly forwards from right-back, picking up a reverse flick from Sean Scannell and then going down in the box under a sliding challenge from David Murphy. Murphy nicked the ball away just as Clyne made contact with his leg and the referee, Keith Stroud, was right to credit an excellent tackle. The second half began with Freedman gesticulating keenly from the touchline but his efforts went unheeded as Palace continued to look like a team drained of their autumnal vim. Birmingham came close to scoring on 50 minutes, as Speroni flapped away Steven Caldwell's goalbound header from a corner. With the game all but devoid of creative incision, set pieces increasingly looked the best bet: moments later Myhill palmed away Jedinak's close-range header from Ambrose's free-kick. As Palace began finally to mount some pressure, more fine, deft work from Clyne, who looked a class apart on the ball, forced a corner that eventually saw the leaping Paddy McCarthy head Ambrose's delivery against a post. Grudgingly the game yielded chances. The busy Burke cut in from the right and his shot was pushed away by Speroni. Then, with six minutes remaining, Palace found the decisive moment of penetration: Ambrose received the ball wide on the left and Dikgacoi met his delivery with a powerful header that flew high into the net past Myhill. At the final whistle Palace had their second win in 10 days, leaving them two points from the play-off spots. As Freedman said: \"That's the great thing about this division. It's a grind. But you get a few wins and you can smell the top six.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
