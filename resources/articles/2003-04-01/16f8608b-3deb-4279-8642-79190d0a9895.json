The Zimbabwe Cricket Union has given the England and Wales Cricket Board formal confirmation that the short and imminent tour will go ahead as scheduled. The tour had been in doubt after England refused to play in Zimbabwe during the recent World Cup but Tim Lamb, the chief executive of the ECB, was told of the decision by Peter Chingoka, chairman of the Zimbabwe union, who had been in consultation with his government's sport and recreation commission. A delighted - and relieved - Lamb said: \"This guarantees a full international programme for the summer, including the first ever Test match to be held at Durham's Riverside ground.\" Zimbabwe will arrive on Wednesday April 30 for a tour that will include two Test matches against England at Lord's and at Durham, followed by participation in the NatWest Series against England and South Africa."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
