But it made an error when it brought elephants into the equation. The piece said that scientists put the annual net loss of ice and water from the ice sheet at 300-400 gigatonnes and that this is equivalent to a billion elephants being dropped in the ocean. However, since a gigatonne is 1 billion tonnes and elephants do not weigh 300-400 tonnes, this was not an accurate, or helpful, comparison. We could have used more directly equivalent measures and compared volumes. A gigatonne of water is equivalent to a cubic kilometre. We might have said that the ice sheet is losing 300-400 cubic kilometres annually (From the melting frontline, a chilling view of a warming world, 1 September, page 1). \u2022\u2008The editing of the obituary of Leonie Cohn (1 September, page 33) led to art historian Ernst Gombrich being wrongly described as an architectural critic, and campaigning architectural journalist Malcolm MacEwen as an art historian. While Patrick Nuttgens was trained as an architect, the description we gave him, he made his main mark as a writer and educator in that field. \u2022\u2008In early editions of the paper on 31 August, one of the photographs in the Eyewitness double spread of animal eyes (pages 18 &amp; 19) was incorrectly captioned as the compound eyes of a dragonfly. The caption should have read: \"A circle of bright yellow skin around a hyacinth macaw's eye is set off against its blue plumage. The bird, native to South America, is the world's largest flying parrot.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
