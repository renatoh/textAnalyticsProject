One of the toughest critics of the deal was the Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott, who resigned as the party's Treasury spokesman after saying the agreement should never have been signed. The chancellor's aim that the accord would allow the relationship with banks to move from \"retribution to recovery\" also immediately fell on closed ears among the unions after it was confirmed that the bosses of bailed-out banks RBS and Lloyds Banking Group were to be awarded a combined \u00a33.5m in bonuses \u2013 albeit in shares and deferred for three years. \"These bonuses have sealed the fate of Project Merlin just minutes after its announcement,\" said the TUC general secretary, Brendan Barber. \"The chancellor can no longer lecture about austerity when he sanctions multimillion-pound bonuses for one privileged section of the public sector and job losses for the rest.\" George Osborne (below) reminded the industry that Sir John Vickers, who is heading the banking commission, has yet to report on whether banks should be broken up. But even so, Project Merlin was being used as a quick test of the coalition's commitment to live up to its first agreement item \u2013 promises on banking. The main promises and assessment of how they have been addressed by the coalition are: Promise: \"We will bring forward detailed proposals for robust action to tackle unacceptable bonuses in the financial services sector.\" Have they done it? The banks are still expected to pay out \u00a36bn in bonuses for 2010, although the coalition insists that they have promised that bonuses for last year will be \"lower than they would have been\". The sums are still clearly huge and it is not clear how much lower the government is expecting the bonuses to be, despite the promise that directors who chair the banks' remuneration committees will write to the FSA to confirm bonuses are indeed lower than normal. Treasury sources were adamant that new disclosure rules on bonuses would be the toughest anywhere in the world. But despite pledges that salaries of the five highest paid executives outside the board would be published, this still allows the highest paid traders and dealmakers to be excluded. The former chief executive of RBS, Sir Fred Goodwin, who earned a seven-figure sum, once admitted that 200 bankers earned more than he did. These disclosure rules will not shed light on such pay practices, experts said, although Treasury sources insisted that remuneration committees would now at least sign off the pay of the 10 highest-paid staff. Jon Terry, a reward partner at accountants PwC, who advises many banks, said \"many of the highest paid employees who do not have management responsibility\" would not be covered. \"It will therefore only provide a limited snapshot of bankers' pay. Shareholders may still find it challenging to make informed judgments about how remuneration takes account of risk in banks, and by itself, disclosure is unlikely to lead to pay restraint.\" Oakeshott questioned what size of bonus was now acceptable. \"Liberal Democrats and the country want to know the simple question: will Bob Diamond of Barclays get a \u00a39m bonus and is that acceptable to the government or not?\" Oakeshott said. He described the use of the taxpayer stakes in the bailed out banks to crack down on pay as feeble. One of the most interesting commitments from the Wednesday announcement was a pledge to consult to make it a \"mandatory requirement\" from 2012 that \"all large UK banks\" publish boardroom pay and that of the highest paid senior executive officers. Vince Cable believes this could allow such individuals to be named, something that is currently only required of boardroom executives. Promise: \"We will develop effective proposals to ensure the flow of credit to viable small and medium-sized enterprises.\" Have they done it? Net lending targets, which are tough to achieve because they make banks exclude the amount of money being repaid by customers, have been thrown out. The \u00a3190bn of commitment to lending is a gross figure, up from the \u00a3176bn lent in 2010, which allows banks to include loans repaid as well as new ones granted. As Oakeshott put it: \"It means what they lend with one hand they can take away with the other.\" The \u00a3190bn includes a pledge to lend \u00a376bn to small businesses, up by \u00a310bn on 2010. This failed to convince economists. Vicky Redwood, economist at Capital Economics, said: \"We doubt that the commitment will stop net lending to firms from falling further. It is currently falling by about \u00a31.5bn per month. Other things equal then, the extra \u00a310bn of lending this year \u2013 or \u00a31bn or so a month \u2013 won't turn this trend around.\" The banks involved do not have to publish the individual commitments. The only bank to do so was Santander which said it would lend \u00a36.7bn in 2011. The Treasury pointed out that a small footnote made a pledge that the Bank of England would continue to collect net lending data and that the government \"would engage\" with RBS and Lloyds quarterly on the basis of this information. Promise: \"We will reform the banking system to avoid a repeat of the banking crisis.\" Have they done it? The government argues that setting up the Vickers commission is a sign that they are serious. But until Vickers reports in the autumn, we will not know the scale and nature of the structural reform to ensure banks are never again too big to fail. A cabinet sub-committee, chaired by Osborne and in which business secretary Vince Cable has a key role, will decide whether to implement Vickers's recommendations. Promise: \"We will introduce a banking levy and seek a detailed agreement on implementation.\" Have they done it? Osborne has promised the industry that the levy on bank balance sheets will not raise more than \u00a32.5bn a year. His surprise decision on Tuesday to hike the levy in 2011 from \u00a31.7bn means that he will achieve this goal in the first year of implementation, not just in subsequent years. Critics argue he could bring in more tax. Ed Balls the shadow chancellor reckons he should reintroduce Labour's bonus tax, which brought in \u00a33.5bn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
