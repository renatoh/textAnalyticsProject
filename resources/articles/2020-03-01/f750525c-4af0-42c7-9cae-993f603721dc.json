City hogged 70% of the ball, they dominated in terms of shots and chances, and goals from Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Rodri gave them a cushion. Mbwana Samatta made it 2-1 with a header for Villa before half-time and City survived a last-gasp scare when Claudio Bravo pushed a header from Bj\u00f6rn Engels against the post. The result meant City have won eight of the past nine domestic trophies, including Community Shields \u2013 the one that got away was the 2018 FA Cup \u2013 and they have their sights set on more this season. They face Sheffield Wednesday in the FA Cup last 16 on Wednesday and hold a 2-1 lead over Real Madrid after the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie. Guardiola said that since winning his first Carabao Cup against Arsenal in 2018 he had won eight of 11 available trophies, including Champions Leagues, but it was put to him that the numbers looked even more attractive when only domestic silverware was considered. \u201cDefinitely,\u201d the City manager said. \u201cI think it\u2019s more remarkable \u2013 the last nine titles, you win eight. So it\u2019s difficult for anyone to do it again, not just us but our opponents. \u201cI\u2019ve won all six finals since I\u2019ve been part of this group so I\u2019m very satisfied. It\u2019s not just about winning one \u2013 it\u2019s to show in every game that we try to win. That\u2019s the best thing we can give for our club. We have a responsibility to win titles. \u201cThere\u2019s no time to rest or celebrate but when you do reflect and remember it\u2019s because this group of players has something special. I will try to convince them to carry on, in every training session it\u2019s about work. The most beautiful one is the Premier League, that is the most difficult and I think we have the numbers to win it in a normal year but another team has done amazingly. But now we have to finish second and we have the cup and the second leg against Madrid.\u201d Guardiola has won 30 trophies as a manager, also taking in his time at Barcelona and Bayern Munich, and he was asked whether he ever imagined being so successful. \u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d he replied with a smile and no little sarcasm. \u201cWhen I was 14 I said I\u2019d be a manager and win 30 titles. I\u2019m so pleased to have been a part of incredible groups of people at Bar\u00e7a, Bayern and City. I\u2019ll always be grateful. They are incredible numbers in a short time. I have a feeling that every time it gets more difficult. Achieving is so nice, so good.\u201d Guardiola talked up three of his players \u2013 the man of the match, Phil Foden, together with Claudio Bravo and John Stones. Bravo\u2019s save to deny Engels was crucial and Guardiola felt Stones recovered after being at fault in the buildup to Samatta\u2019s goal. Foden said he had been told that he would start by Guardiola in training on Saturday. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to play and it was an unbelievable day,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I play, every minute counts, so I try and do my best and I\u2019m very proud of my performance today.\u201d The Villa manager, Dean Smith, said he was disappointed but proud. \u201cWe had a mountain to climb at 2-0 down but I was pleased with the reaction. I was never concerned that the game would get away from us. I thought we asked questions of them. This level of performance is the standard we have to have in the league. The concentration now goes on to that. We can take a lot of heart from this.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
