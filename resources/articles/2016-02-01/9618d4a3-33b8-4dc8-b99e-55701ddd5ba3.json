At \u00a340,000,001, the bid was provocative and it should have been enough but Liverpool\u2019s principal owner decided that, forget the clause, forget the extra pound, forget the Uruguayan\u2019s public plea to leave, he wasn\u2019t selling. \u201cApparently, these contracts don\u2019t seem to hold,\u201d he told a conference in Boston, seven months later. Henry\u2019s words might have annoyed Su\u00e1rez but for the fact that something else he said rang true: \u201cIt\u2019s been great for us,\u201d Henry said. He also said: \u201cIt\u2019s been great for Luis.\u201d It had, too. By then Su\u00e1rez was leading Liverpool\u2019s bid for a first league title in 24 years and, while that ultimately ended in disappointment, the striker crying beneath his shirt at Crystal Palace, he finished top scorer in the Premier League, joint winner of the European Golden Shoe. And the following summer he did get away. To an even better place, too. In the end Su\u00e1rez got what he wanted, but only after they had refused to let him have what he wanted. The move to Barcelona he had dreamed of but always thought beyond him. Yet even before he had joined Barcelona he had concluded that he would have regretted moving to the Emirates. He had been lucky, he admitted, and was grateful Liverpool said no. The blunt text message from Liverpool\u2019s chairman, Tom Werner, saying: \u201cLuis, you are staying,\u201d ended up being a good thing. \u201cI\u2019ve never really thought about what would have happened if Liverpool had accepted Arsenal\u2019s bid,\u201d Su\u00e1rez wrote in his autobiography Crossing the Line. He might have found himself on the other side on Tuesday night, for a start. By the summer of 2013 Su\u00e1rez had decided he had to leave England. His season had finished five matches early because of the bite on Branislav Ivanovic and David Cameron had called him a \u201cterrible example\u201d. But only Arsenal offered a formal bid and therefore an exit. \u201cMy head was all over the place,\u201d he wrote. It was still England but he wondered if London would do. \u201cA big city, a chance to get lost and to play Champions League football. Deep down it wasn\u2019t what I really wanted, but I began to tell myself that this might work.\u201d Steven Gerrard told him something different. He told Su\u00e1rez he should wait, not push for an exit that would be denied him anyway; that if he was to leave Liverpool it had to be for one of the Europe\u2019s biggest clubs. Bayern Munich, Real Madrid or Barcelona would come, Gerrard said. He was right: the following summer, two of the three did. By then Su\u00e1rez had signed a contract extension with Liverpool, the release clause watertight this time, and he joined Barcelona over Madrid for \u20ac81m. He was unable to play until that October because of his Fifa ban but things have gone rather well since, that sense of good fortune reinforced. At last month\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or ceremony in Zurich he finished fifth and the only surprise was that he wasn\u2019t higher. Leo Messi and Neymar expressed their surprise he was not on the podium with them. They would, of course, but they had a point. He had won the treble with them, and the European Super Cup and World Club Cup followed. He had scored two in Manchester, two in Paris and one in the Champions League final against Juventus. Excluding penalties, he scored more goals in 2015 than any other player in any of Europe\u2019s top five leagues. He has not slowed down in 2016; in fact, he has accelerated, scoring 12 goals in his last six games and more than anyone in Europe\u2019s top leagues since the turn of the year. On Wednesday he missed a penalty but curled in a superb goal soon after as Barcelona beat Sporting Gij\u00f3n to go six points clear at the top of the table, seven ahead of Real Madrid. It was his 24th league goal, the division\u2019s top scorer, his 40th in all competitions this season. Only three Barcelona players have done that before, and it is still only February. His 41st came on Saturday, the first in the win at Las Palmas. And nor is it just about goals, far from it. Asked about Barcelona\u2019s success, about a front three who scored a remarkably evenly spread 134 goals in 2015 \u2013 Messi 47, Su\u00e1rez 46, Neymar 41 \u2013 the Argentinian said: \u201cThe key\u2019s good chemistry.\u201d Much is made of how well they get on, perhaps too much as Cristiano Ronaldo irritably insisted this week, but Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s manager, Diego Simeone, was right to say such \u201ccomplicity\u201d is \u201crare\u201d in football. The three are genuinely close and Su\u00e1rez really does have remarkably little ego. \u201cNeymar and Messi are the best; I\u2019m one of a pile of others,\u201d he said. That has been fundamental, on and off the pitch. A case can be made for describing Su\u00e1rez as the best player in Europe so far this season, the first player in Spain to reach double figures for goals and assists, but he talks like he doesn\u2019t consider himself talented. More importantly, he plays like he doesn\u2019t, either. He runs like a man who thinks he\u2019s no good at all. At the Camp Nou that matters. Other strikers did not embrace that role as he has. When Barcelona scored that indirect penalty last weekend Messi\u2019s pass was actually meant for Neymar. But, the Brazilian said, \u201cGordito got there first\u201d, using a nickname that means Fatty. That he did, despite not being in on it, was a telling portrait. The inspiration, the cheek, was theirs but the execution was his. There he was: ready, determined, arriving first, his run actually starting just inside the box. It never occurred to him that he was taking it off Neymar until the giggling Brazilian told him. That attitude carries others. As the Spanish phrase has it, Su\u00e1rez is contagious. The impact on the team has been enormous, beyond the goals. \u201cHis arrival has strengthened them,\u201d Simeone said. \u201cI haven\u2019t got a bad thing to say about him. He\u2019s complete: he can turn with his back to goal, arrive from deeper, score from mid-distance, head it, take free-kicks. I love not only the way he plays but his intensity and voracity. He gives a touch of \u2018vertigo\u2019 to their attack that they didn\u2019t have before.\u201d In short, he has made them better. Much better. It is impossible to know what would have happened had Su\u00e1rez signed for Arsenal but it is extremely unlikely that he would have won the treble. More to the point, it is extremely unlikely that Barcelona would have done either. Su\u00e1rez could have joined Arsenal but he ended up in Barcelona instead. Five trophies later, he faces the team he could have signed for. Back then, John W Henry stopped him; now Arsenal must do the same."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
