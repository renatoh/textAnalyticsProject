We have relegated them to corners, picked them at the wrong moment, and declared them ugly and unworthy. So let's set things straight. That unloved, sour bush on the allotment is not meant for casual grazing. Raw, the berries will strip your mouth and leave your tongue furry. Like apples, gooseberries come in two groups: cookers and eaters. The cookers tend to be early and green; the hard berries are best for tarts and perhaps pudding \u2013 anything where disproportionate amounts of sugar can be added. Dessert types are larger, often not ripening until late in the season. They are trickier to grow and sometimes shy to crop, but when they do, you sink to your knees and thank the rain gods. These are the true taste of British summer: sweet, floral and with a hint of tartness. If the crop is heavy, thin the fruit from late May onwards, so those left can swell to perfection. Gooseberry growing hit its peak in the late 19th century. Few of the varieties popular back then still exist, but those that do are worth hunting for, including 'Whinham's Industry' (prolific, red, tolerant of poor soils), 'Leveller' (the best yellow, large, but needs good ground), 'Lord Derby' (late red with large fruit) or 'White Lion' (late white with large berries). Many of these varieties suffer from American gooseberry mildew. In a bad year, it covers plants in a white bloom that turns the fruit brown when cooked. Modern breeding has rectified this, with the likes of the 'Hinnonm\u00e4ki' group \u2013 disease-resistant dessert varieties in red, white and green \u2013 and the dessert/cookers 'Invicta' (pictured)and the almost thornless 'Pax'. These lack the complex flavours of true dessert varieties, but are excellent for jams. (While we're on the subject of pests and diseases, if you suffered sawfly devastation this year, remove mulch from around the plant now and lightly cultivate the topsoil to expose the adults, which overwinter in cocoons, to the birds or frost.) The best deals are for bare-rooted plants dispatched from now until March. Get them into the ground or a pot as soon as the weather allows. In small gardens, try cordons \u2013 single upright stems that produce lateral fruiting spurs \u2013 30cm apart. Or grow as a large bush, but don't overcrowd the plant, and prune regularly to keep a goblet shape \u2013 good air circulation helps to keep mildew at bay. Other than that, a mulch in spring, and these easy-going plants will reward you with plenty of fruit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
