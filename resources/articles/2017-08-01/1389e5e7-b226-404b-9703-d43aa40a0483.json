The Mexico forward expects to make his competitive debut for Slaven Bilic\u2019s side at the stadium he called home for four seasons; the venue brings positive memories although he admits to being \u201cshocked\u201d when Sir Alex Ferguson, who signed him from Guadalajara, retired in 2013. \u201cI can just say it\u2019s luck,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said of the fact his return to English football, having spent two seasons at Bayer Leverkusen before joining West Ham for \u00a316m last month, comes against United. \u201cIt was a great experience [there] \u2026 only happiness. I was living my dream and made that big step, which is not common. \u201cThere is nothing negative about going there. It\u2019s going to be my first game with my new club, against my old club in my old house. It\u2019s only positive things \u2013 it\u2019s an important moment for me.\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez scored 59 goals in 157 appearances for United during a five-year spell that also brought a season on loan at Real Madrid. He helped them win Premier League titles in 2010-11 and 2012-13 under Ferguson, averaging almost a goal every two league games in each of those campaigns, and says he was jolted by the sudden departure of the long-serving manager. When asked if Ferguson\u2019s announcement was a surprise, he said: \u201cI didn\u2019t see it coming. Nobody did. It was very strange. We were shocked but we were very respectful too because he decided squads, games, everything \u2026 it was his life. \u201cHe was the manager who brought me here and opened the door to Europe. He taught me to be a better footballer; we won the 19th and 20th Premier Leagues for Manchester United together, so of course I was going to be upset when I had a good relationship with a person who gives you a lot of confidence and helps you to improve as a person and a player.\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s form at United tailed off after Ferguson departed. He scored nine times in 33 appearances the following season but would make only five more appearances thereafter, eventually furthering his career in Spain and \u2013 with considerable success \u2013 Germany. He accepts United\u2019s wider fortunes dipped to a greater extent than he had expected. \u201cEverything changed [when Ferguson left],\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot only tell you one thing. I don\u2019t say this in a good or bad way, it was just change, and we didn\u2019t respond as well as David Moyes or we wanted to. Nobody wants to be out of European competitions or not fight for the title.\u201d Both of those goals appear a long shot for a West Ham side who finished 11th in last season\u2019s Premier League. Hern\u00e1ndez is viewed as the cure for a malaise that has seen a string of often underwhelming centre-forwards shuttle through the club over recent years but says he bears no extra burden. \u201cI feel the same as when I went to Manchester United, when I went to Real Madrid and Leverkusen, and now West Ham,\u201d he said. \u201cI am going to play football, which is something I was fighting for since I was a kid, and then we will see what happens. It\u2019s easy to say I can score 20 goals, or that I have a lot of pressure, or not, or blah, blah, blah. Speaking is very easy but the most important thing is to prove myself on the pitch.\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez felt flattered to hear Jos\u00e9 Mourinho say he could have scored \u201c20 goals easy\u201d at United last season but pointed out, with no sense of bitterness, he \u201cdidn\u2019t get the chance to prove it\u201d. He prefers to focus on the sense of possibility in reviving his new club and believes he can fulfil his ambitions there. \u201cI\u2019m looking at it as a challenge in the same way as when I go with the national team or any of the clubs I played for before,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s football, I want to keep doing it and show I can achieve the things I dream of, and I think I can.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
