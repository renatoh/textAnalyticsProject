David Cameron", "bodyText": "It was Gordon Brown who tried to chill everyone's spines by summoning the blue lady's blood-stained, tear-smeared exit from Number 10. 'Remember when Mrs Thatcher left,' said the Chancellor. 'It was unstable, it was disorderly and it was undignified.' He invoked that dreadful spectre on breakfast television, which was not the appropriate time of day for the telling of ghost stories designed to scare the living daylights out of any small child or Prime Minister who might be watching. It is always a safe assumption with a man as verbally disciplined as Gordon Brown that he says nothing by mistake. In the many private arguments that have raged between him and the man he is agitating to replace, the Chancellor has often told Tony Blair that it would be a tragedy for his historical reputation and a disaster for Labour if his premiership ended in Thatcher-like grief. By broadcasting that message on TV, Gordon Brown turned a private warning into a very public threat that Tony Blair will suffer the same fate unless he surrenders to his Chancellor's demands to leave Number 10 before the end of this year. That is the first of the three significant developments that make this a crucial juncture in the course of politics. In that interview and several others, Mr Brown has, for the first time, put himself visibly at the head of the mob trying to tear down Tony Blair. Since the government's battering in the local elections, there has been a concerted and choreographed attempt to force an early retirement date out of the Prime Minister. The Chancellor's allies have launched full-frontal attacks with the barely coded encouragement of their master. Gordon Brown did not need to tour studios to call repetitively for 'renewal'. Once would have been enough to convey his meaning. What does he want? He wants Tony Blair out. When does he want it? Now. This putsch has long been in the planning. It was on the day after the last general election that the Chancellor's camp identified the first half of May as the time to strike against Mr Blair. To hit him after the local elections has been on the Brownite grid for 12 months. The second significant development is that this onslaught is working. Tony Blair is palpably weakened. His allies do not deny it. Every premiership is subject to the laws of political entropy: the longer he is there, the greater grow the numbers of those with grievances against the leader and the smaller is the band of those who still invest hope in him. The disappointments of his rule become more salient with the public than the achievements, a process that begins to reverse only once the leader has gone and can be calmly considered in the context of his predecessors and successors. Tony Blair thought he had devised a cunning plan to avoid being torn out of Number 10 like Margaret Thatcher. By announcing in advance that he would not fight a fourth election, he reckoned that he'd snuff out any plots to remove him, because it wouldn't appear to be worth the trouble. Why stab Caesar when he has already promised to hang up his toga? As the Prime Minister must ruefully admit today, his cunning plan has failed. You can measure his current vulnerability by his enforced retreat from his previous insistence that he would serve a 'full term' to the promise that he will give a successor 'ample time' to establish himself as Prime Minister. You could hear it in the deadly silence of Labour MPs during Prime Minister's Questions as the Tories jeered him. You could see it in the graveyard faces of the Number 10 officials watching from their box in the chamber. It has always been foolish to underestimate the Harry Houdini of Downing Street. His premiership has had many premature obituarists. But even to his friends, Tony Blair now looks like a chess player who is running out of moves to avoid checkmate. The next danger moment for the Prime Minister is imminent. In just over a week, his schools reform legislation will return to the floor of the Commons. Back in March, at the second reading, Mr Blair got safe passage for his flagship reform only by relying on Tory support. It is not at all certain that the Conservatives will throw him that lifeline again. I have it on the very best authority that the Conservatives are thinking hard and with deadly seriousness about how they could legitimately make common cause with the Labour rebels to inflict humiliation on the Prime Minister. 'Can we resist trying to bring down Blair?' asks a senior Tory frontbencher. 'It's very difficult.' David Cameron is on record as saying that the sooner Tony Blair is gone, 'the better'. You can see why the Conservatives would think that when the polls suggest that the Tories would do better against a government led by Gordon Brown. This should be further warning to the Labour party to put an instant end to the fratricidal warfare that is consuming the government. The ferocity of the feuding is out of all proportion to the subject of the argument. Even the most evangelical of Mr Blair's supporters have always assumed that he wouldn't try to stay in Number 10 beyond the autumn of 2008. All but the most venomous of Blair-haters did not expect him to quit just a year after winning a third general election victory. The sensible tendency in the Labour party has expected him to stay in Downing Street at least until May 2007, when he could leave knowing that he had clocked up a decade at Britain's most important address. So, at most, the quarrel is about 18 months. One reason it does matter so much to the antagonists is that the battle over the timing of his exit is an expression of serious differences of policy, tactics and strategy between Downing Street's neighbours from hell. Even when they managed to bang together a compromise over pensions, the two camps couldn't help but spin warring interpretations of which side had won. Given the provocation, Tony Blair was generous to Gordon Brown last week when he told a news conference: 'I have no doubt he will be absolutely New Labour to his fingertips.' If that is true, what is the Prime Minister's problem with handing over now? That is the hardest question for Tony Blair to respond to, because the honest answer would have to be that he actually doubts that Mr Brown really would be New Labour to the tips of his bitten fingers. Important as some of their differences are, the divides between Mr Blair and Mr Brown are not so cosmic that they would justify risking the self-destruction of the New Labour project that they jointly created. Those whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make mad. In this case, the gods have nothing to do with it. The Prime Minister and the Chancellor have driven each other crazy. Mr Blair has been maddened by what he sees as Mr Brown's persistent sabotage of his premiership. When the Chancellor waves the shroud of Thatcher, the Prime Minister believes Gordon Brown is trying to bring about the very thing he says he wants to avoid. For his part, Gordon Brown has been maddened by the other man's refusal to give him a date for the succession and then stick to it. The Chancellor now seems determined to maintain the pressure on the Prime Minister until he has extracted a commitment to an early leaving date signed in blood in front of a roomful of witnesses. That is the one thing the Prime Minister does not want to give him. 'How long do you think the date would remain secret?' asks one of Mr Blair's confidants in the cabinet. Consumed by their toxic struggles with each other, the faction fighters of Labour have become blinded to the most significant development in this febrile period. Just as the government loses the plot, the Conservatives are back in the game. For the first time since Tony Blair became Labour leader, the Tories are now registering sustained and significant leads in the polls, building on the back of the local elections that saw them making important gains in the Midlands, London and the south of England. No sensible Tory that I know leaps from there to predicting that David Cameron is a dead cert to win the next election. But it should be deeply alarming to the government that the Tories are reclaiming the voters of Middle England from New Labour. I judge Gordon Brown to be winning his struggle to wrest power from Tony Blair. And yet it is the restless Chancellor who ultimately has more to lose than the man he would remove if there is a blood-splattered finale to the premiership of Labour's most electorally successful leader. Voters mercilessly punish parties that become so poisoned by their own feuds that they forget the concerns of the public. Infighting wrecked the Labour party in the 1980s as it ruined the Tories in the 1990s. A short-term victory by Gordon Brown over Tony Blair will be purchased at enormous long-term cost if more and more voters come to despise a government obsessed only with its own fratricidal hatreds. There will indeed be a transition of power. But it won't be orderly. It won't be smooth. And it will be from a Labour government to a Tory government."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
