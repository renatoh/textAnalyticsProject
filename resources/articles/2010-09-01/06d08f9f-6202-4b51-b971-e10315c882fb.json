I don't care what you say \u2013 I like her. I like her unblinking, avaricious gaze; her willingness to take no shit and to send it to those who have displeased her in beribboned Tiffany boxes. I like her enthusiastic embrace of all that is most insane and meretricious about modern entertainment, and above all I like the sense that deep down, somewhere in the depths of her soul, she still retains a spark of humanity that animates and makes almost charming the whole. I am talking of course of Sharon Osbourne, now hosting VIVA/MTV's Sharon Osbourne's Charm School (I know. It's a concept so delicious it's got to be fattening). She is in loco parentis \u2013 that's Latin for mad mother figure \u2013 to 14 female contestants, all of whom have got to know and hate each other on other reality shows. They trade insults. \"She looks just like me, but really ugly,\" says Brandi C of a fellow participant. Megan terms stripper Heather's outfit \"a wrestler-superhero-ugly-whore-streetwalker-bitch combo\". (\"Harsh,\" you think. \"But fair.\") They spout idiocies. \"I don't really see working in my future,\" explains Megan. \"I think the best fit for me would be to be a top-of-the-line trophy wife.\" Raven wants to be a new age talk show host. \"I'm not being brashful,\" she says. \"I actually have talent.\" I'd love to go through the rest but a) I don't have the space and b) the paltry resources of the written word cannot possibly do justice to the myriad pathologies on display, courtesy of possibly the most revolting group of people ever gathered together for any purpose short of a war crimes tribunal. They are so bad that even Sharon has a faint look of horror when confronted with them en masse. The spark is fanned into a tiny flame. She wonders aloud whether Raven is \"as mad as a box of frogs.\" And to Brandi C she mutters the heartfacsimilefelt advice, \"No more ditzy shit, OK?\" In this world, it looks like a tsunami of maternal solicitude. It's the world we live in, people, and it has gone mad."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
