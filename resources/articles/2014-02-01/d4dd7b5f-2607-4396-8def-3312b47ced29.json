The former world heavyweight champion, who withdrew twice last year from fights with Tyson Fury, told the Guardian he has been in constant rehab for several months but has not given up hope of resuming his career. \"If my shoulder gets back to 85% of what it used to be, that's more than enough. I'll be happy with that,\" he said. \"At the moment, I'm not that great. I can't really do to much with it. I can't run, for instance; the motion of running hurts my arm too much. But I'm not supposed to be running. It's not part of my rehab programme. \"It's all very basic movements, in and out, up and down. Because there was a lot of work done: six pins in my shoulder. My bicep snapped off.\" Speaking at the London launch of the Rocky heavyweight collection on Blu-Ray, Haye said he has not entirely given up on his own Hollywood ambitions but he still has the hunger to fight again. He revealed a long scar in his right shoulder that provides visible proof that the injury he suffered last year was genuine and was not, as Fury and a lot of boxing fans thought, an excuse to dodge their showdown. Haye, who looked trim but said he was some way short of fighting shape, understands the cynicism. \"That's the nature of people, particularly boxing fans. They're one person's fan one day, that person loses a split decision, unjustly, and everyone jumps off that bandwagon. It's just the way things go. \"I had to withdraw from three fights in a row [Manuel Charr was the other opponent left disappointed]. And that's deemed inexcusable in the boxing world. Two pullouts, that's it, you're finished. Three, nobody wants to see you ever again. I can understand that. If I were a boxing fan and I'd paid money to see someone. OK, they had an injury, it happens; it happens again and it's 'Come on, this is terrible.' \"And I can understand Tyson Fury's frustration. Anyone would feel that. I would if I were in his position, particularly when you train hard for a fight, and it's no fault of your own [that it's called off].\" He said of his injury: \"They had to pin it all back together. I was throwing the same punch that I've thrown hundreds of times, a right hook. That's the muscle, the subscapilaris, that brings the arm across. That's my punch. I'm not called the Hayemaker for nothing. It did my bicep as well. It had to be re-attached to my shoulder. \"So it wasn't a good situation. But people have recovered from similar situations in the past, and some haven't. So, we'll see. If it's humanly possible for my body to heal and regenerate, it will. \"I haven't given myself a timetable. It could take a year. It could take six months. I don't know. Different doctors say different things. Some say, no problem, it'll be OK. Others say that particular injury, you'll be lucky to get 50% of the movement back. \"But if I get 85% back, I'll still be knocking people out, for sure.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
