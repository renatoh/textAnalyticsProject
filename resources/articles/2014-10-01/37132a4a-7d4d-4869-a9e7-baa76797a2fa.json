The report in the Daily Telegraph said Blair had told long-standing political allies that David Cameron will remain in power next year because Labour has not persuaded Britain it is ready to govern. The newspaper quoted a person present at the alleged conversation saying: \u201cThe Conservatives will be the next government because Labour has failed to make a good case for itself. That is what Tony thinks. He does not think that Miliband can beat Cameron.\u201d However, Blair\u2019s office strongly disputed the account. Asked whether the former Labour leader could recall such a conversation, a spokesman for Blair said: \u201cThe story is nonsense and absurd. It is not his view. He wants Ed and the Labour party to win the general election and believes they can and will.\u201d Miliband continues to enjoy a lead in almost every opinion poll, with most suggesting Labour will at least be the largest party after next year\u2019s election. However, some senior Labour figures are worried about Miliband\u2019s low personal popularity ratings and the fact he is trailing behind Cameron in terms of confidence in him running the economy. Party grandees such as Lord Mandelson have also suggested they would like him to send a clearer message to businesses. In the past, Blair has warned Labour that will not win the next election if it bases policies on delusionary thinking of how it wants the world to be. In a speech in July marking 20 years since he was elected Labour leader, Blair said: \u201cOld ideas in new clothing are still old ideas and are visibly so when undressed by reality. We should always be uncomfortable in the \u2018comfort zone\u2019, because the only comfort found there is for the already privileged.\u201d At the time, he publicly backed Miliband, saying he wanted the party \u201cto be working hard for the next Labour government, in 2015, with Ed as PM\u201d. But he also reminded colleagues that the party needed to be progressive and have the good of Britain\u2019s people at its heart to win the support of voters. \u201cWe want society to change and actively to lift up those who are down. It begins with an analysis of the world shaped by reality not ideology, not by delusionary thoughts based on how we want the world to be, but by hard-headed examination of the world as it actually is. The same applies to how we interact with people. This has to mean real people. Not the ones you find in the committee room but the ones you find at the bus stop or the bar or the cinema.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
