While Pok\u00e9mon Go initially raised hopes of an innovative, albeit inadvertent, approach to encouraging individuals to walk further, new research suggests such effects are short-lived. \u201cWe found that playing Pok\u00e9mon Go moderately increases [players\u2019] physical activity but the effect was not sustained over [a] six week period,\u201d said Katherine Howe, co-author of the research from Harvard University. Writing in the British Medical Journal, Howe and colleagues from the US and Sweden describe how they sought to unpick the impact of augmented reality games on physical health by recruiting both players and non-players of Pok\u00e9mon Go through an online survey. In total, 560 avid Pok\u00e9mon Go players \u2013 defined as being those who had reached level five or higher \u2013 and 622 individuals who had not downloaded the game took part in the study during August 2016. All of the participants were between 18 and 35 years old and had an iPhone 6. The smartphone automatically and passively records steps, allowing the researchers to compare the activity of participants four weeks before players downloaded the game with their number of steps taken during the six weeks after. \u201cIt is very objective data \u2013 it wasn\u2019t self-reported so we really had an accurate reading of how many steps the users and non-users of the game walked,\u201d said Howe. The results revealed that before downloading the game both non-players and soon-to-be players took a similar number of steps a day, averaging 4126 and 4526 steps respectively. However, after players had downloaded the app, the two groups diverged. While non-players took a similar number of steps per day throughout the whole period of interest, players of Pok\u00e9mon Go took, on average, 955 extra steps a day in their first week of chasing digital creatures. \u201cIt translates to around 11 minutes additional walking per day, which is about half of the World Health Organisation\u2019s recommendations for walking [of 150 minutes per week],\u201d adds Howe. But the effect was short-lived \u2013 within six weeks the number of extra daily steps among players had returned to pre-download levels. While the study did not probe the reasons behind the drop-off, Howe suggests it could be down to a combination of two factors - some players quitting the game completely and remaining players taking fewer steps. Despite the findings, Howe remains optimistic that development of games like Pok\u00e9mon Go could a have positive impact in myriad ways. \u201cThere is a huge potential for augmented reality games to be beneficial for our health \u2013 they give us a reason to go outside, walk and socialise,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I think there is a huge potential to develop these games to not only increase physical activity but also boost mental wellbeing, mood and social interaction for people of all ages.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
