England can make certain of their place in Russia next summer by defeating Slovenia at Wembley next Thursday but Southgate was clearly unhappy after naming a 26-man squad that includes a recall for Fabien Delph of Manchester City and the selection of several players who are below their best form. Jamie Vardy\u2019s absence with a hip problem has increased the manager\u2019s worries and will inevitably raise questions bearing in mind the Leicester City striker is expected to play for his club at Bournemouth on Saturday. However, Southgate insisted he understood Vardy\u2019s reasons for pulling out and made it clear he was more concerned about the number of players who were not playing well. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because the biggest story here is we have about 12 players missing with injury,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible. If you were to say, \u2018Am I entirely happy with the squad I\u2019ve named?\u2019 then no, because we\u2019ve got too many good players missing with injury. And the consequence of that, you could well argue, is that there are one or two in the squad who haven\u2019t necessarily warranted it on their performances.\u201d Southgate declined to identify who he meant but his latest squad selection, also taking in the game in Lithuania next Sunday, comes at a time when Alex Oxlade\u2011Chamberlain, Jermain Defoe, Daniel Sturridge and Jesse Lingard have had slow starts to the season. Delph played for Manchester City in their Champions League tie against Shakhtar Donetsk on Tuesday but has not started a Premier League game since 8 April and Southgate had previously told his players he would not select them unless they were regulars for their clubs. That has become difficult to maintain at a time when England\u2019s list of absentees now includes Vardy, Danny Rose, Adam Lallana, Danny Drinkwater, Nathaniel Chalobah, Tom Heaton, Michail Antonio, Nathaniel Clyne, Ross Barkley and Danny Welbeck. Phil Jones and Michael Keane have both been called up but are carrying injuries of their own and Southgate sounded as though he expected them to pull out. England\u2019s players meet at St George\u2019s Park on Sunday and Southgate intends to tell them he is not happy about the lack of competition for places. \u201cThe reality is that I don\u2019t want players to be comfortable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe danger when you don\u2019t have competition for places is twofold. What\u2019s the level needed to get in the squad? And is everyone fulfilling that at the moment? Well, I\u2019m not so sure they are. \u201cThere\u2019s been a couple of easy decisions because I haven\u2019t had to make any phone calls [to players who might feel hard done by]. They are always difficult phone calls to make but I\u2019d rather be making them. After that, we come into training and it\u2019s: \u2018Am I a shoo-in to get in the team or do I have to push a bit harder because I have a couple snapping at my heels?\u2019 There\u2019s a good challenge for those players in the next week if they want to stay in the squad.\u201d Vardy will be missing because he needs a painkilling injection to help him manage a hip issue and Southgate was asked whether the player\u2019s involvement for Leicester this weekend would leave the England management looking weak. \u201cIt could look like that but, in the end, the most important conversation for me is with the player. From the conversation I\u2019ve had with him, I know how much he wants to play but how much pain he\u2019s in. He\u2019d run through brick walls for us, no question, and his mentality is top drawer. Whatever the perception, it\u2019s not the reality. I have a responsibility to every player and I\u2019ve never asked a player to play with an injury that I thought needed sorting.\u201d Southgate, who revealed he had unsuccessfully tried to talk James Milner out of international retirement last season, is also aware Dele Alli might be unavailable after Fifa\u2019s disciplinary case, held on Thursday, into the player\u2019s middle-finger gesture during the World Cup qualifier against Slovakia. \u201cDele fully understands his responsibilities,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cHe knows it\u2019s something he won\u2019t do again. We have given our side of events and Dele has given his side of events. We\u2019ve had a good chat with Dele about lots of different things. The biggest disappointment for him is missing football.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
