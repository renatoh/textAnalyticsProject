He vowed that his party would offer the electorate a coalition with Fine Gael only after what he called 'nine years of failure'. Speaking at his party's annual conference in Dublin, Rabbitte said Labour has succeeded in convincing the Irish public of the need for an alternative government. 'We must now convince people to vote for that change. People will vote for an alternative government that shows a capacity to listen and makes an honest effort to ease the pressure of modern living,' he said. Rabbitte told delegates that a Labour-Fine Gael coalition would not raise taxes when it comes to power. 'There is no need to increase taxation and Labour has no intention of doing so. We will end the waste of taxpayers' money and we will harness our economic prosperity to make our society fairer and our communities safer. And we will tackle the important things that don't work, like the health service and crime prevention.' The Labour leader said that while there was more money and lower taxes there are more bills, higher prices and stealth taxes. He described the new prosperity in Ireland as a 'gilded cage.' Rabbitte focused on rising crime rates across the Republic, especially in Dublin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
