A paper presented at the American Sociological Association annual meeting in Denver on Monday says females, students of color, LGBTQ students and poorer students who binge drink reported feeling more satisfied with their collegiate experience than their peers who didn't. Within the more socially satisfied white, wealthy and straight male students, again, the binge drinkers reported having a more positive social collegiate experience than those who didn't binge drink. Instead of drinking because they were part of a low-status social group, students used binge drinking as a tool to feel included in campus life. By imitating the behaviors of the higher-status groups \u2013 who binge drink at higher rates than the lower-status groups \u2013 they seemed to have received more social acceptance. \"What we have evidence of, is that they [the high social power groups] are defining the norms on campus,\" co-author of the study, sociologist Carolyn Hsu told the Guardian. \"They are defining what is and what is not popular, what is the right way to fit in on this campus or not.\" The 1,595 students interviewed in the study attend an anonymous liberal arts college in the north-eastern US that is mostly male, white and straight. Hsu said many of the students who took the survey, which was on more than just drinking issues, wrote-in about binge drinking. \"A number of students would write things like: 'I don't want to binge drink, but that's what everyone does' or 'Binge drinking is the only thing to do, everyone here is rich and white and in a sorority or fraternity and they all get smashed and I don't really feel like I belong in that, but that's what you do here,'\" Hsu said. In the study, binge-drinking was defined as drinking four or more drinks in one session for women, and five or more drinks for men, at least once in a two-week period. As the study notes, binge-drinking increases the risk of violence, risky sexual behavior, drunk driving, poor academic performance and future alcohol dependency. \"After I read 50 of those, I would think, 'Look at how many of you are not like that, why don't you just get together and have a party on your own terms,'\" Hsu said. \"Why do you let those people define what it means to belong on this campus when there are plenty of you?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
