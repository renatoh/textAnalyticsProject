When Welsh does make the headlines, it tends to be in the context of English visitors complaining about restaurant staff and pub clientele speaking it, as though people speaking their own language in their own country were a deliberate act of rudeness. So when Alffa, two teenage rock musicians from rural Gwynedd, north Wales, passed 1m plays on Spotify with a Welsh language song, I\u2019ll admit I was very surprised. We Welsh speakers may live and breathe the language, but many people outside Britain are unaware it even exists. All my life, it has been in crisis \u2013 but change is in the air. The number of speakers has surged to 874,700 \u2013 up from 726,600 in 2008, according to the Office of National Statistics. The Welsh Assembly has set a goal of one million Welsh speakers by 2050 (the population of Wales is 3.1 million) and it\u2019s off to a good start. But, subtler than that, there seems to have been a cultural shift that Alffa\u2019s achievement embodies: whereby identifying as Welsh is no longer a source of social stigma, nor discouraged in favour of a more homogenous notion of \u201cBritish\u201d. People are proudly proclaiming their Welshness, finally taking the Welsh classes they had always meant to take and streaming bands such as Alffa and singers like Gwenno. Patriotic murals bearing the slogan Cofiwch Dryweryn (Remember Tryweryn) \u2013 a reference to the valley that was flooded in 1965, drowning a village in order to create a reservoir for the people of Liverpool \u2013 are appearing all over the country. The detective noir series Hinterland / Y Gwyll and mystery miniseries Hidden / Craith, both dramas originally produced for the Welsh-language public TV channel S4C, have reached wider audiences through streaming on the BBC and Netflix. A surprising number of people who have never even been to Wales are learning the language using the app Duolingo. Could it be that Welsh is finally becoming cool? \u201cYou might as well ask a fish if the water it swims in is cool,\u201d my dad says, gnomically, when I ask him. He has a point. The musician Gruff Rhys is from Bethesda, the next valley over from mine, and with his band Super Furry Animals was part of the original 1990s \u201cCool Cymru\u201d wave. \u201cThe attitude in general is one of respect now,\u201d he says. \u201cObviously there are trolls, but I think people are exposed to much more of the world than they used to be. We can listen to music in a multitude of languages and people aren\u2019t fazed by different cultures in ways that they used to be when I was growing up.\u201d Yet the Welsh language has long been in the hands of traditionalists, even within Wales. The standup comedian Kiri Pritchard-McLean is Welsh born and bred, but is only now learning the language in a concentrated way. \u201cI just feel like I\u2019m missing a part of my own culture by not doing it. I felt like I was complicit in the oppression by not speaking it,\u201d she says. \u201cI love the country, I love the countryside, I love the history. But I can\u2019t speak the language \u2026 It\u2019s hiraeth.\u201d Hiraeth is an untranslatable word meaning a wistful but unrealisable longing for home (and also, apparently, the name of actor Rooney Mara\u2019s ethical clothing brand. She is American, not Welsh). \u201cI want my kids to be brought up in Wales speaking Welsh,\u201d says Pritchard-McLean. Her family background and school played a large part in why she isn\u2019t a fluent speaker. \u201cI think the sort of person who would choose to teach Welsh, they always seemed like chapel-goers in pleated skirts,\u201d she says, describing Welsh as the class to slack in. The fact that there are different registers of Welsh (literary, colloquial, and a number of dialects and slangs) didn\u2019t help matters. \u201cMy father\u2019s side of the family, who are all first-language Welsh, really believe in the language and its preservation, and don\u2019t like the Wenglish some speak,\u201d says Pritchard-McLean. \u201cThey are very traditional; they use quite academic words and it felt very distant to me. It sounds like Lord of the Rings when my dad speaks to his brothers.\u201d To an extent the internet has liberated the language. Rhodri ap Dyfrig is an online content commissioner who works on Hansh, a popular Welsh-language social platform aimed at 16- to 34-year-olds. \u201cSocial media has made the Welsh language in all its diverse registers, accents and dialects more visible than ever before,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore you\u2019d have to go to S4C, or newspapers, or Radio Cymru, and that would be the form of Welsh language you would hear and maybe not connect to in some ways. \u201cWhat we know now is that there is a wide continuum of Welsh speaking, there are people who are learners, there are people who are rusty, there are people who have gone through mainstream education and who haven\u2019t spoken for like five years. They\u2019ve still got it, but they don\u2019t feel confident, and that confidence thing is one of the biggest barriers.\u201d https://www.facebook.com/hanshs4c/videos/1924552757665329/Hansh is successful because it\u2019s funny and inclusive, and the content is made by and for young people. Most importantly, it shows there are myriad ways in which to be Welsh. \u201cIn the 90s, things were much more tribal,\u201d says ap Dyfrig. \u201cIf you listened to Welsh language music, you probably didn\u2019t listen to much else. You\u2019d be in those gigs and that would be your world. The internet has completely changed all that. There is a multiplicity of identities within people now.\u201d Leena Farhat, a 21-year-old computer science student at Aberystwyth, is one such Welsh speaker. \u201cMy dad\u2019s from Lebanon so I speak Arabic. I grew up in Geneva for a bit so I speak French and German, and my mum\u2019s side of the family is from Mauritius so I speak Creole. I\u2019ve been enjoying Welsh when I can,\u201d she says. She grew up having Welsh godparents and holidaying in Wales, and always felt a connection. Having so many other languages has helped her learning. \u201cMy parents both came from ex-colonial places, so they grew up in bilingual systems. Some Welsh people have been taught in Welsh at school but speak English at home. That sort of bilingualism, people take for granted, but it\u2019s very special.\u201d Another factor in the shift towards Welsh positivity could be the rise of English nationalism in the wake of Brexit. \u201cI think there is a rise in identity politics in my generation and I feel this when I talk to people. I say: \u2018I\u2019m Welsh\u2019,\u201d says Farhat. \u201cPeople look at me a bit like: \u2018Oh, cool\u2019. It\u2019s that idea of challenging Britishness and what that is. People in the older generation say \u2018I\u2019m British\u2019 first. They associate Britishness with the English language but we have other languages in these isles.\u201d Welsh language learner Benjamin Siddall, 26, concurs. \u201cWe definitely live in a time where people are being taught to celebrate what makes them different as opposed to what makes them fit in \u2013 I think that is a nice thing.\u201d Siddall is London-based and has never lived in Wales, but he and his Welsh-speaking girlfriend want to raise their children to be bilingual. \u201cI just thought it was really cool \u2013 they have this secret language they can all speak, and no one knows what they\u2019re talking about. It was fun to get involved in,\u201d he says. I ask him how he feels about the criticism, often levied by English settlers, that Welsh is useless outside of Wales and therefore there is not much point learning it. \u201cIt\u2019s an odd criticism because a language gives you so much more than just the utility to speak to other people; it gives you ways to describe things and experiences. The more language you have, the more excitement you are going to find in those day-to-day experiences.\u201d Siddall, a university fundraiser, travels extensively for work throughout Europe and Welsh has, he says, enriched his understanding of other languages and their relationships to one another. It might be that, in trying to protect Welsh heritage, the Welsh language lobby has not always been inclusive. Mymuna Mohamood, 29, is a research assistant from Butetown in Cardiff who identifies as Somali Welsh. She speaks Somali, Arabic, English and Welsh. She had Welsh lessons in school and is now learning on a course through work. \u201cIt\u2019s been a great opportunity,\u201d she says, \u201cespecially being from a minority ethnic background and growing up in Wales, having dual identity, your culture being Somali and Welsh. The Welsh have the same thing, so that\u2019s where that passion stems from.\u201d Last year, partly in an effort to be more inclusive, the Welsh Eisteddfod \u2013 the annual Welsh language cultural event usually held in rural locations \u2013 took place in Butetown, where people from ethnic minority backgrounds make up around a third of the population. \u201cI went with my friend who is half-Pakistani, half-white Welsh, who speaks fluent Welsh, and people\u2019s reactions were just shock and horror,\u201d says Mohamood. \u201cWe felt we were standing out like sore thumbs in our own community. We were like a minority within a minority. It was so odd. \u201cThey had this whole conception of the Eisteddfod being white Welsh middle class, and when I was saying \u2018dwi\u2019n siarad Cymraeg\u2019 [\u201cI speak Welsh\u201d] they were looking at me as if to say, \u2018How is that even possible?\u2019 Somalis have been here for over 200 years, and I\u2019m still getting these questions.\u201d Expanding conceptions of what it means to be Welsh can only be a good thing, though there is clearly still much work to be done. As Mohamood notes, Welsh classes need to be affordable and accessible if the assembly is to reach its one million speakers target. As exciting as it is to see Welsh embraced for its cultural capital, as Rhys notes, that might not last for ever. \u201cI suppose the problem with notions of cool is that things become uncool, but any culture and language deserves its space to be uncool as well.\u201d Though the language now has an official role in public life, after much campaigning, the next step is securing it the same rights in the private sector and that is harder to regulate, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s very much at crisis point and it\u2019s crucial that multinational tech companies are able to [embrace it],\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to happen in the EU, where [representation of minority languages] is regulated, but the fact that Alexa can\u2019t speak Welsh is a huge problem.\u201d Personally, I quite like the idea that Welsh could become a secret language of resistance against international tech companies. Beyond any ephemeral ideas of coolness, however, a true victory for the language would be that it is able to survive. My dad was right. Like the water we swim in, it\u2019s there and it\u2019s ours. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 June 2019 to correct the year in which the Tryweryn valley was flooded from 1956 to 1965."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
