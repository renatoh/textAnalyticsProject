Recorded in a week with collaborators including James Yorkston, this is a lo-fi, high-intensity collection of acoustic musings that suggest Van Morrison singing with Red House Painters. Crowley's rich brown croon inevitably recalls Nick Drake or Tim Buckley, but a more apposite musical touchstone is Badly Drawn Boy, or the Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon eschewing his clever-clever wordplay in order to sink into a sepia reverie. Two-thirds of the songs have an oceanic theme, but these are no sea shanties: Star of the Harbour and Brother at Sea evoke the opiate slow-core of Low or Codeine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
