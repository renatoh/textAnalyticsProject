Costing $1.1bn (\u00a3840m), the mission has attracted the eyes of the world, with a live video link to the operations centre providing a fly-on-the-wall scene as Juno neared its goal. Finally, at 0318 GMT on Tuesday, scientists pulled off a nail-biting manoeuvre in which the spacecraft slowed down, amid Jupiter\u2019s dust rings and radiation belt, so that it could be pulled into orbit around the planet. \u201cJuno sang, and it was a song of perfection,\u201d said project manager Rick Nybakken in a press conference following the triumph. Others too, seemed delighted and relieved. \u201cThe risks that were overcome, it\u2019s amazing\u201d said Diane Brown, Juno\u2019s project manager from Nasa\u2019s jet propulsion laboratory. \u201cThe more you know about the mission the more you know about how tricky it was. To know we can go to bed tonight not worrying about what is going to happen tomorrow, is just amazing.\u201d Scott Bolton, the principal investigator of the Juno mission, was similarly euphoric: \u201cYou\u2019re the best team ever!\u201d he told his colleagues. \u201cWe just did the hardest thing Nasa has ever done.\u201d The spacecraft itself sent a message of thanks via Twitter. But as Nasa\u2019s team celebrated, Juno\u2019s task has just begun. The size of a basketball court, the spacecraft will spend 20 months peering beneath the clouds of Jupiter, helping scientists to unpick the puzzles of the gas giant \u2013 such as whether the planet\u2019s core is solid and why its great red spot appears to be shrinking. \u201cIn a couple of days, we will turn these science instruments back on and we will start gathering data,\u201d Bolton told the Guardian. But with the spacecraft currently in a 53-day orbit, the spacecraft is not scheduled to swing close to Jupiter until the end of August. That event, says Bolton, will provide data on everything from the planet\u2019s gravity to its magnetic field, as well as offering the first look at its deep atmosphere. It will also shed light on another conundrum: the conditions Juno is facing. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have a real understanding of what the environment was that we just flew through,\u201d said Bolton. \u201cWe know we just survived it. \u201cThe very first view with these instruments from a unique perspective, will come at the end of August.\u201d After a second 53-day orbit, the team will slow down the spacecraft by firing its engines, putting it in a 14-day orbit around Jupiter in mid-October. \u201cOnce we do that every other Wednesday we will fly very very close to Jupiter and we will begin mapping it, which is what the primary goals are about,\u201d said Bolton. With Juno a mere 3,000 miles from Jupiter at its closest (by comparison, the moon orbits roughly 238,800 miles from Earth), the spacecraft is expected to encounter astonishingly harsh conditions, including strong radiation and an extremely high magnetic field, as well as the possibility of dust and, potentially, meteorites \u2013 all of which could cause havoc for spacecraft. \u201cAt the speeds we are travelling, which are about 165,000 miles an hour, if a pebble hits you, it is a much more serious issue,\u201d said Bolton. \u201c[Juno] is the fastest racecar in the world, ever.\u201d In an attempt to safeguard Juno, the spacecraft features titanium and tantalum shielding as well as other precautions. But it remains to be seen if they are enough. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t really test it completely for those environments because we couldn\u2019t create a laboratory that is Jupiter,\u201d said Bolton. For now, he says, they will simply have to watch and wait. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford false confidence that everything is OK because we have not gone through [the environment] with our eyes and ears open,\u201d he added. \u201cThere will be continued nail biting for the next couple of passes until we can establish with our sensors what is it that we are really going though.\u201d The success of putting Juno into orbit, however, bodes well for the mission, he says. \u201cThe thing I am most excited about is we are finally going to see inside Jupiter,\u201d said Bolton. \u201cI am pretty confident that, because we did so well [on Monday] night, that we will at least get a couple of looks deep into Jupiter to see what it is like, even if the environment is really, really bad.\u201d Like Brown, Bolton could be forgiven for looking forward to a good night\u2019s rest, but with the mission in many ways just beginning that seems unlikely. \u201cI was incredibly tired, because I haven\u2019t slept much over the last few days,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I am excited and I can\u2019t sleep!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
