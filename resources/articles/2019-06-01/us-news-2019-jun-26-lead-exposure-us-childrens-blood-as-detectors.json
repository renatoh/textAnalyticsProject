The window sills were the perfect height to help her toddler pull himself up to stand and walk. Eventually, Catholdi-Dow would enter the room and catch her son nibbling along their edges. By this point, her son had already been diagnosed with both autism and pica, which is an eating disorder that causes a person to crave and eat non-food items. After a few months of this behavior, her mother-in-law suggested a call to the pediatrician\u2019s office to check his blood for lead, just to be safe. Catholdi-Dow, of Attleboro, Massachusetts, initially dismissed her concerns, but began doing research on the internet about how lead, a neurotoxin, can cause behavioral and developmental problems even at low levels. She also read that old homes, like the one where they lived, could have lead-based paint that poses a hazard to young children when it starts to deteriorate. But when she called her pediatrician\u2019s office with her concerns, she was at first gently rebuffed. \u201cThey were worried that insurance wouldn\u2019t cover it until his three-year [appointment],\u201d Catholdi-Dow said. \u201cBut because I had a reason to believe that it could possibly be lead poisoned at the time, they ended up going ahead and doing it for me.\u201d When Catholdi-Dow\u2019s son had his first blood lead test, the results came back at 24 micrograms per one-tenth litre of blood \u2013 almost five times higher than the reference point the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) uses to recommend a lead intervention. More comprehensive tests to confirm lead exposure found that her son\u2019s lead levels had actually reached 49 micrograms per one-tenth liter of blood (49 \u00b5g/dL) \u2013 almost 10 times higher than the CDC\u2019s intervention threshold. He was immediately hospitalized at Boston children\u2019s hospital. In the meantime, a lead abatement team also visited their home, which had been in her husband\u2019s family for three generations. They found lead hotspots on the door frames, window sills, and in her son\u2019s bedroom closet. \u201cMy husband\u2019s family had grown up in the house, so I didn\u2019t even think twice about it being safe or not safe,\u201d Catholdi-Dow said. Generations Catholdi-Dow, like many other Americans, likely assumed that lead was a hazard that endangered only previous generations. After all, the federal government had begun reducing lead in gasoline in 1972 and banned its use in paint for homes in 1978. Making things more confusing is that the history of the rise of lead in American manufacturing, as well as its eventual phase out, is often framed as a public health victory already won. But this national narrative obscures a horrifying truth about lead, which is that sudden mass exposure can happen anywhere, anytime \u2013 as it did in Flint, Michigan when improperly treated water began corroding lead pipes and releasing harmful chemicals into the tap water in 2014. And due to a complex mix of factors including the various competing pressures on physicians and weak regulations about how to report this data, there is no federal system that can quickly identify lead exposure emergencies as they happen. When it comes to lead exposure in America, we still don\u2019t have a clear picture of how many children are being exposed to the neurotoxin and where they are. This leaves hundreds of thousands of children vulnerable to the dangers of lead, and compounds inequality in the form of cognitive and behavioral deficits that can hamper communities for generations. Experts say that it\u2019s possible to eradicate lead from American infrastructure, but that we don\u2019t prioritize it. \u201cWe are currently doing things backwards [by] using children\u2019s blood as detectors of environmental contamination,\u201d said Dr Mona Hanna-Attisha, the pediatrician who famously uncovered elevated levels of lead in her pediatric patients and linked it to a new water source in Flint, Michigan. \u201cThe screening that needs to happen is in the environment before children are ever exposed.\u201d Why lead is so dangerous Lead is a naturally occuring heavy metal valued for both its affordability and malleability. People have used lead to make cosmetics, drinking and eating vessels, aqueducts and more since the days of Ancient Rome (the word \u201cplumbing\u201d comes from the Latin word for lead, plumbum). People from the ancient world also knew that coming into direct contact with large amounts of lead was harmful, and linked to forgetfulness, melancholy and insanity. But this didn\u2019t stop manufacturers in America and other countries from using lead compounds in pipes, paint, food cans and gasoline at the turn of the 20th century. All of these industrial uses put lead particles in the air, in homes and in food and water. In Europe, France, Belgium and Austria were among the first countries to ban it in interior paints in 1909. By 1924, independent American scientists understood that lead in gasoline posed a lethal hazard to the workers making gas, as well as a more subtle but chronic danger for people breathing in car exhaust and factory emissions. But it wasn\u2019t until the early 1970s that Congress overcame intense industry opposition and began slowly banning the use of lead-based paint in federal housing, removing lead from gasoline and setting limits on the element in drinking water. It was a long process; lead wasn\u2019t completely banned from gasoline until 1996. The US is still grappling with how to remove lingering lead from the environment. Last Friday, the Environmental Protection Agency finalized new regulations that would drastically cut the levels of acceptable lead in dust in public housing, hospitals and schools built before 1978. By 1976, the blood lead level of the average American child between one to five years old was estimated at 15 micrograms per one-tenth litre of blood , or what is now three times the CDC\u2019s current intervention threshold. Scientists would eventually discover that lead exposure during childhood can destroy brain cells, disrupt communication between neurons and shrink the prefrontal cortex, which is the part of the brain that helps with complex decision making, emotion and aggression regulation and impulse control. Nationally, chronic lead exposure in the US has been linked to everything from a significant loss of IQ points to a rise in violent crime to billions of dollars lost in future earnings and tax revenue. There is no \u201csafe\u201d level of lead, and its effects are irreversible. The only treatment that doctors have at their disposal, chelation, is not used except in extreme poisoning cases. Young American children nowadays have an average blood lead level of about one microgram per one-tenth liter of blood (1 \u00b5g/dL). We know this because every year, a small but representative sample of about 5,000 Americans are picked randomly to answer surveys and undergo physical exams that will give health officials an overall picture of the nation\u2019s health \u2013 including how much lead is in people\u2019s blood. This sample is known as the CDC\u2019s National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). But this national average tells a deceptive story about the risks that environmental lead still pose to children. The CDC estimates that there are more than half a million children in the US like Catholdi-Dow\u2019s son who have blood lead levels at or above the CDC\u2019s reference value for intervention. They are concentrated mostly in low-income communities throughout the country because they are the ones who are most likely to live in substandard housing. An estimated 23m housing units in the US have at least one lead-based paint hazard \u2013 3.6m of which are homes for children under six years old. Making matters even worse is that the US does not have a robust surveillance system that can find these at-risk children and track potential emergencies like the 2014 one in Flint, Michigan, said Eric Roberts, a research scientist specializing in lead exposure at Public Health Institute, a not-for-profit health research organization. Indeed, the Flint, Michigan lead exposure crisis was uncovered by concerned citizens, local pediatricians like Hanna-Attisha and independent scientists. This is because not all states require pediatricians to measure blood lead levels in children or report them to county or state health departments. These results, in turn, may or may not get reported to the CDC. That means that the CDC\u2019s most up-to-date local data can\u2019t be used to identify short-term trends or make generalizations about childhood lead exposure at the local, state or national level. It took a 2016 Reuters investigation to identify and map out more than 3,800 neighborhoods throughout the US with lead exposure rates double those found in Flint, Michigan, after their water became contaminated. Reuters\u2019 maps are based on local public health data that had not been published. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services require all children enrolled in Medicaid be tested for lead at ages one and two years old. But this kind of universal screening has never been achieved. In fact, Roberts estimates that less than 20% of all young children are tested for lead, no matter what kind of insurance they have, and this screening only identifies about 60% of children with elevated blood lead levels in the US. This estimate, which is the only comprehensive analysis on the subject, is based on numbers from the previous decade. \u201cI know that in the public health establishment we\u2019re very pious about our belief that lead exposure is bad and protecting kids is good,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see us making an honest effort to make sure that all the kids are lead free.\u201d What would it cost to rid the US of lead hazards permanently? If the US is serious about bringing down blood lead levels, officials need to both strengthen blood testing regulations and set their sights on remediating lead in homes, water infrastructure and soil, public health officials and advocates say. \u201cWe\u2019ll never medically test our way out of this,\u201d said David Jacobs, chief scientist at the National Center for Healthy Housing and a former director in charge of lead hazard control at the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to test the houses, not only the children who have already been exposed.\u201d The CDC also agrees that getting rid of lead in the environment is the best way to prevent lead exposure. \u201cPrimary prevention \u2013 the removal of lead hazards from the environment before a child is exposed \u2013 is the most effective way to ensure that children do not experience harmful long-term effects of lead exposure,\u201d said Dr Adrienne Ettinger, chief of the CDC Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program. The issue is cost \u2013 about $400bn over a 10-year period, according to a calculation by Vox\u2019s Matt Yglesias. But the investment is worth it. Removing leaded drinking water lines, remediating lead paint hazards, eliminating lead from plane fuel and other eradication efforts to protect just the children born in 2018 alone could result in as much as $84bn in future benefits, according to a 2017 analysis from the Pew Charitable Trusts. This money would be in the form of increased revenue and savings to the healthcare, education and criminal justice systems. While the report didn\u2019t put a figure on the total cost of these repairs, it estimated that it would cost $2bn to replace lead service lines and $18.7bn to deal with lead paint hazards in homes for the 2018 babies. The federal government is the obvious main funder for this kind of initiative, but Jacobs says that the money should also come from private sources \u2013 specifically, the paint and gasoline companies that put all the lead in the environment in the first place. \u201cCompanies who caused this problem have to be part of the solution,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cEveryone else has paid for it except them.\u201d Lawsuits This concept has antecedents in settlements like the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, which set up a perpetual pot of money funded by America\u2019s largest cigarette companies to help states pay for tobacco-related healthcare. California is the first state to pursue and win this kind of judgment against former lead paint manufacturers. In 2017, the California court of appeals upheld the Santa Clara county superior court decision to hold Sherwin-Williams Company, NL Industries, Inc, and ConAgra Grocery Products responsible for finding and remediating homes with lead paint hazards built before 1951. The US supreme court declined to hear the paint manufacturers\u2019 appeal, and the lead abatement fund is now set at $409m, according to the county of Santa Clara. While this may seem like a lot of money, it\u2019s nothing compared to what paint companies might have to pay if more jurisdictions begin allowing people with documented lead poisoning to pursue these lawsuits individually. In May, a federal jury awarded three Milwaukee men $2m each for lead paint poisoning they suffered as toddlers, to be paid by the paint companies Sherwin-Williams, Armstrong Container Corp and DuPont. The verdict is the first of its kind, and the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that he hopes that the decision \u201cis just the beginning\u201d of a wave of lawsuits. In Cleveland, Ohio, city officials are under renewed pressure to reduce high levels of lead exposure in homes, particularly in its almost 50,000 one- or two-unit rental homes, where a majority of children who are poisoned live, because of grassroots advocacy on the issue. Educating landlords, contractors, parents After Catholdi-Dow\u2019s son was hospitalized, he endured six months of chelation therapy, which involved swallowing a medicine that both tastes and smells like rotten eggs twice a day. He is now six years old, and his blood lead levels have decreased significantly. When he entered elementary school, Catholdi-Dow struggled with whether or not to disclose his former diagnosis and current blood lead level, which is now at 12 microgram per one-tenth liter of blood (\u00b5g/dL). \u201cI was very nervous to share it with his teachers because I didn\u2019t want him to be written off as someone who had brain damage and wouldn\u2019t be able to learn,\u201d she said. Catholdi-Dow knows that the effects of acute lead exposure will become more obvious as he gets older, when school becomes more demanding. Currently, her son is mostly non-verbal unless he\u2019s repeating songs or TV shows that he likes. And while it\u2019s difficult to disentangle the effects of lead poisoning from his autism diagnosis, she and his doctors feel that his hyperactivity may be one consequence of the exposure. Thankfully, Catholdi-Dow has nothing but praise for the teachers at her son\u2019s school. His special education class maintains a one-to-one ratio of teachers to students, and she says that his teachers see his potential and teach to his strengths. Another thing she\u2019s thankful for: her youngest child, a daughter one year younger than her son, has no detectable lead in her blood. \u201cWe\u2019re very lucky that it wasn\u2019t a dust situation, and [the lead exposure] was more from him biting.\u201d Because of everything she and her family have experienced, Catholdi-Dow decided to join the Childhood Lead Action Project, a Rhode Island organization dedicated to eliminating lead exposure in children. She helps educate landlords, contractors and parents about the potential hazards of both lead paint and lead paint removal. If not done correctly, power sanding, open flame burning and other paint removal techniques can actually produce lead dust, making the problem even worse. Catholdi-Dow thinks one thing that could prevent lead exposure in future children would be to make lead testing and education a standard part of prenatal care and preparation for a new baby. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re buying a home, definitely get it checked for lead before purchasing it, especially if it\u2019s a home built before 1978,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
