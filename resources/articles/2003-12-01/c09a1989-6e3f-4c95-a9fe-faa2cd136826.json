Young people are either too busy playing video games or stabbing each other to bother racing to Woolworth's after school to buy up the latest sounds. Pop music is invariably sinking to some new low in turnover or quality. File-sharing is threatening the fabric of the industry. Our losses were especially staggering this year, too: Nina Simone, Johnny Cash, June Carter Cash, Barry White and Elliott Smith. But there were reasons for some cheer in a few boardrooms. In the third quarter of 2003, UK album sales grew by 7.6 per cent. Albums are now cheaper than ever before, thanks to aggressive discounting by supermarkets and online shops. Despite Basement Jaxx's best efforts, no one has yet put the bottom back into the dance music market, but rock bands such as The White Stripes and The Darkness releasing singles on seven-inch format meant that vinyl's popularity was up 35 per cent on last year. In addition, Coldplay proved that British bands could do the business in America. Robbie Williams stuffed a good proportion of the UK population into three Knebworth gigs. It's hardly time for everyone to pack up and go home. A few people might have to soon, though. After Universal gobbled up Island last year and London got sucked into Warner, the major labels spent 2003 cannibalising each other further. If the monopolies men agree, Sony and BMG will become one, and turn a quarter of the music sales pie chart into one flavour. Warner and EMI continue to dance around one another attentively. The antics of men in suits are hardly ever the point though. In 2003, people seemed to be genuinely excited about music again thanks to a bumper crop of event records and big personalities. There was Justin Timberlake, made over into a Michael Jackson it was kosher to adore if you were underage (or even if you were old enough to know better). Of the triad of ex-Mouseketeers at the top of pop's pile, he and Christina Aguilera saw their stock rise while Britney's wobbled. 50 Cent unseated his mentor Eminem as the biggest news in hip hop. Em, meanwhile, went from b\u00eate noire to poet laureate in the wake of his semi-fictional 8 Mile film contextualising his demons to white middle-class critics. Beyonc\u00e9's solo gyrations carved out a whole new stratosphere of fame for her, and her duet with Sean Paul was one of a series that saw the dancehall star become 2003's most tireless refrain. The deftest movers this year, though, were producers The Neptunes, and in particular Pharrell Williams. Not satisfied with masterminding all the prettiest R&amp;B productions, Pharrell cropped up in his charges' videos, playing drums and showing off his tattoos, and finally released his own single. Rarely has a backroom fixer moved in front of the camera with such style. In the UK Top 10, the quality of pop was kept buoyant with great singles by Girls Aloud, Junior Senior, Panjabi MC, and more sweet dancehall, thanks to Wayne Wonder and Kevin Lyttle. There were indications, too, that the pre-teen pop market had reached saturation point. Gareth Gates struggled, as did Rachel Stevens and countless other talent-show also-rans whose names, even now, we struggle to remember. Bucking the trend were the surprisingly durable Will Young, the depressingly durable Westlife and Busted, whose canny repackaging of American pop-punk prefigures what will almost certainly be the way forward for boy bands in 2004. The new name on everyone's lips, though, was The Darkness. The story of how some unreconstructed Queen fans with receding hairlines became superstars in 2003 could only gladden the heart. But then they started being hailed as saviours of rock. The Darkness may have brought a welcome ray of bright catsuitery to our pop landscape but you suspect Darknessmania may have had more to do with a safe, parodic repackaging of heavy rock for Robbie Williams fans than the genuinely fascinating, ugly beast itself. Just as entertaining were The Libertines, whose volatile mix of lurching tunes, break-ups, drug problems, prison stints, reconciliations and unannounced gigs in front rooms kept fans mesmerised. Less thrilling was the disinterring of Elton John and the triumph of the safe and mediocre in Jamie Cullum. From the rock gutter to faux-lesbian titillation: the Russian teens Tatu did it best, in conjunction with a ridiculously catchy single. Madonna and Britney's snog whiffed faintly of desperation as their careers idled. Madonna hooked up with Missy Elliott to flog some trousers, too, detracting further from her once unassailable mystique. Despite not releasing any music in 2003 (unless you count Posh's single on 29 December), Victoria Beckham and Courtney Love gave excellent soap opera. Posh went hip hop, to the dismay of her record label. It didn't do her much good, but it made Roc-A-Fella magnate Damon Dash a household name in the UK. Love, meanwhile, lost the plot on prescription drugs, lost custody of her daughter, and her debut solo album, America's Sweetheart, was delayed for the umpteenth time. Trouble flared around Michael Jackson, arrested on suspicion of child abuse. Phil Spector's mansion was the setting for a gun drama that left an actress dead and Spector arrested on suspicion of shooting her. As December closed a triumphant year for The White Stripes, Jack White was accused of assaulting the lead singer of Detroit band The Von Bondies, who had spent 2003 making disparaging comments about the Stripes. Pete Townshend and Massive Attack's Robert '3D' del Naja were swept up in the UK's child porn investigations, but cleared. It was tempting to connect 3D's arrest with his outspoken views on the Iraq conflict, but it left his commitment undimmed. Blur's Damon Albarn also took a principled stand, as did the Dixie Chicks whose criticisms of George W. Bush caused a furore in the US. Radiohead's Hail To The Thief was the most obvious musical response to the war, but Super Furry Animals's Phantom Power also decried the hubris of The Man. In a year where pop's glitz and sparkle shone especially bright, it was heartening to see a few were not blinded to real events.
