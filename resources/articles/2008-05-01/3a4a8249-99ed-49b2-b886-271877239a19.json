Tremlett, who pulled out of the end of Hampshire's most recent championship match against Surrey last week, has been added to England's 12-man squad in place of Matthew Hoggard. Hoggard was a member of the 12-man squad named for the first two Tests but was omitted from the first Test and has subsequently had a finger broken by his rival Steve Harmison. Hampshire's coach, Paul Terry, said last night: \"Chris has had a sore back but he did bowl for us in the nets today and came through and I expect him to play in our Friends Provident Trophy match against Worcestershire tomorrow.\" The England captain, Michael Vaughan, said after yesterday's Test: \"We believe Chris deserves this opportunity. He bowled well for us last year. He picked up an injury in New Zealand when it looked like he might start in the Test squad.\" Harmison was a possibility to replace Hoggard but Vaughan added: \"Harmy just has to bowl a bit more for Durham and get a couple of big five-wicket hauls.\" Tremlett's bounce troubled New Zealand when he played for the England Lions against New Zealand less than two weeks ago and the pitch at Old Trafford is expected to have pace and bounce. But Tremlett is still the likely 12th man in Manchester because England will probably be unchanged. \"We have been consistent in the past,\" Vaughan hinted. Centrally contracted players who are not in the Twenty20 side look likely to get a slice of the money being offered by the billionaire Sir Allen Stanford. \"The discussions with the ECB centrally contracted players and the England Twenty20 squad are one of the final parts to complete our agreement with Sir Allen which will benefit all areas of cricket,\" the England and Wales Cricket Board said yesterday. Meanwhile England's batsmen may not have seen the last of Shane Warne after all. Just 16 months after retiring from Test cricket the great leg-spinner says he might be available to play in next year's Ashes series in England. Warne, 40 next year, has led the Rajasthan Royals to the top of the Indian Premier League with 14 wickets at 18.78 and says: \"If Australia really needed me and there was no one else around, and Ricky thought I could do the job, you would weigh up the options.\" Warne retired from Test cricket after Australia won the last Ashes series in January last year. Earlier Ponting, while congratulating Warne for bowling as well as ever, doubted whether the player was interested in a comeback. But Warne told Australia's Herald Sun: \"I would still love to be playing international cricket and I miss it, because I devoted 20 years to first-class cricket. It's a big part of my life. If you could just turn up and play Test cricket that would be cool. I would definitely consider that. At this stage it's a fairytale.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
