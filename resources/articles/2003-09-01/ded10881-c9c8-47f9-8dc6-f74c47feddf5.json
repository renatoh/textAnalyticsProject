Wellington, New Zealand's capital, knows how it feels to be the last kid to be picked for the school sports team. It has been through years of virtual obscurity, skulking in the shadows of its bigger and brasher neighbour, Auckland, and the tourist honey traps of Australia and Fiji. Diplomats winced when told they were Wellington-bound and even Kiwis would turn up their noses at a trip to their capital. Not any more. Wellington has rebooted, bursting into bloom as a charming, artistic and sophisticated city. It is awash with alternative cafes, elegant restaurants and bars to match those in Sydney or Melbourne. There is a full dance card of theatres and galleries and the national museum, Te Papa, is the envy of many European capitals. It is very much the favoured place to live for Kiwis but, despite this, its population still has not topped half a million, even when you include the forested valleys on its outskirts. Wellington is also registering on the global celebrity radar as it has been the nerve-centre for the making of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the third of which (The Return of the King) is still in production there. The cafes are overrun with American and Scottish hobbits (Elijah Wood and Billy Boyd), Australian princesses (Cate Blanchett) and thespian mystics (Ian Holm and Ian McKellen). Visitors are also discovering that it is intensely picturesque. Given the city's position facing the tempestuous Pacific and Southern oceans, and the meteorological bombardment it takes from their gales and swells, it should by rights be a southern hemisphere equivalent of Lerwick or Labrador. Wellington's claim to be the world's windiest city puts Chicago's bid firmly in the shade. Yet, between the storms and racing clouds, the city maintains a calm and genteel air, a mild climate and long days of balmy summer sunshine. Mount Victoria in the centre of town is the best place to see the city living up to its peaceful reputation. The gabled, weatherboard houses file pleasingly over multiple volcanic ridges which divide the city into lush valleys. They are mauve and cobalt and yellow, like children's toys. The architecture has been compared to San Francisco, the harbour to Seattle and the surrounding hillsides to Tasmania but this vista is neither American nor Australian. Wellington has one of the most individual and distinctive cityscapes. It is also a powerful city, housing NZ's government in a controversial building nicknamed the Beehive. Pluck runs like a seam through Wellingtonians. Their city sits on one of the most twitchy fault lines in the world. To my horror, on a visit to Te Papa's Awesome Forces exhibition, I discovered that, in the three days I had been in town, there had been half a dozen small quakes, including one measuring a respectable 4.4 on the Richter scale. Yet, rather than panicking every time the ground shakes, the fearless locals count the tremor-ripples in their goblets of local Pinot Noir and order another round. Wellington has not simply blossomed on its own, however. A concerted campaign, Absolutely Positively Wellington, has put the city back on the visitor map. It is obviously working, as one former Auckland dweller put it with envious calm: \"You feel well in Wellington.\" \u00b7 Matthew Brace was a guest of Air New Zealand and Absolutely Positively Wellington. Arts The main Visitor Information Centre in Civic Square (corner of Victoria and Wakefield St) has a free arts map to galleries, museums and heritage sites. A must-see is Te Papa (Cable St, tel: 04 381 7000, fax: 04 381 7070, email: mail@tepapa.govt.nz, tepapa.govt.nz), a waterfront museum and gallery (see the Awesome Forces exhibition complete with earthquake simulator and traditional Maori marae, or meeting house). The restaurant Icon is also excellent. Free tours of parliament buildings (corner of Lambton Quay and Molesworth St, tel: 04 471 9503, ps.parliament.govt.nz) are hourly. Visitor centre open Mon - Fri 10am-5pm, Sat 10am-4pm, Sun 12pm-4pm. For a handy gig guide visit: thepackage.co.nz. Eats There are 400 restaurants and cafes in Wellington and a good place to start is Cuba St. For breakfast try local favourite Fidels. Olive, is a good alternative if Fidels is packed. Cafe L'Affare (27 College Street, tel: 04 385 9748, laffare.co.nz) has arguably the best coffee in town. Best for dinner is Logan Brown (corner Cuba and Vivian St, tel: 04 801 5114, fax: 04 801 9776, loganbrown.co.nz), housed in a former 1920s bank. Regulars include government ministers, Lord of the Rings stars and All Black super-winger Jonah Lomu. Drinks Start at Matterhorn (106 Cuba St) for cocktails where the staff are dressed in VietCong chic. The Good Luck Bar (basement at 126 Cuba Street) is a throwback to a Chinese opium den and is a firm favourite with the hobbits who party there regularly. Night owls head for Motel on Forresters Lane, a lounge bar owing artistic licence to the Communist chic of a Prague metro station. Friendly staff, soft booths and chill-out CDs make for a relaxing end to the night. Hotels Best bet is the Duxton (170 Wakefield St, tel: 04 473 3900 or 04 471 5717, fax: 473 3929, email: reservations@wellington.duxton.co.nz, duxton.com) in the centre of town with great views overlooking the harbour.

Te Kairanga (Martins Road, tel: 06 306 9122 , fax: 06 306 9322, tkwine.co.nz, daily 10am-5pm) produces, for my money, the most drinkable Pinot. Alana Estate (Puruatanga Road, tel: 06 306 9784, fax: 06 306 9789, alana.co.nz), as we go to press, was bidding to be key supplier for Fortnum and Mason. Open daily 10.30am-5pm. Wellington boat For a different view take the Inter Island Ferry across Cook Strait (which can be among the roughest in the world) to Picton on the South Island. Details from the Information Centre. Adrenaline rush NZ has produced more heart-stopping devices than almost any other nation. Its latest export is Fly By Wire - where you lie on a rocket suspended by cables and are propelled to speeds over 100mph, while you whiz around a grassy valley just inches from the ground. Its inventor, Neil Harrap, says it is the closest thing to flying a jet fighter. Call ahead (tel (free in NZ): 0800 359 299, or 025 300 366, fax\" 03 442 2116, flybywire.co.nz). Green Wellies See the fur seals lounging on the rocks of the Cook Strait with Seal Coast Safari (tel: 025 534 880, email: sealtour@xtra.co.nz. sealcoast.com). Karori Wildlife Sanctuary (tel: 04 920 9200, sanctuary.org.nz) is a unique conservation project where 252 hectares of habitat are slowly being transformed into original native forest, to resemble what this part of NZ looked like thousands of years ago. Take walking boots for this Wellington must-see. Sports Wellington is a big rugby town. The local town club is the Lions. One step up is Hurricanes, one of five NZ teams in the southern hemisphere Super 12 tournament. Not forgetting the All Blacks who play at a stadium in town known affectionately as the Cake Tin and where England recently triumphed in their World Cup warm-up game. Shopping Local olive oils and cheeses at Kapiti Olive Shop at Lindale Centre (theoliveshop.com), an hour's drive north up State Highway One along the Kapiti coast.
