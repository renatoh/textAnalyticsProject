Consider turning the thermostat to a lower temperature: 16C-18C is best. If you can, invest in a humidifier, which puts moisture back into the air. Moisturiser is especially important in winter, so use a richer product than in other seasons \u2013 and don\u2019t forget your hands. Your lips will benefit from balm. It is also important to minimise exposure to agents that strip the skin of its natural oils. Water \u2013 especially hot water \u2013 dries the skin, so make sure you\u2019re using warm or lukewarm water for baths and showers, as well as washing your hands and doing the dishes. Sweating also dries and irritates the skin, so after strenuous exercise change into something clean and dry as soon as you can. Steer clear of alcohol-based skincare products such as cleansers and toners. Try also to avoid bubble bath and opt instead for bath oils.
