Pull the udder one", "bodyText": "Arms and the Cow / La Rondine Bradford Alhambra, and on tour until 16 June George Formby used to camp it up at Bradford's lovely old Alhambra Theatre, and nothing much seems to have changed during Opera North's recent residency. A Caribbean island peopled by men in lederhosen, when not in outrageous drag: even David Pountney's taste for excess surpasses itself in the 'Tyrol-sur-mer' setting of his outlandish staging of Kurt Weill's operetta Arms and the Cow The title is Pountney's own mock-Shavian version of the untranslatable Der Kuhhandel, rendered as A Kingdom for a Cow in the work's only previous performance, its 1935 premiere in London. After a run of two weeks, even Weill abandoned his misbegotten offspring, a crude satire on the rise to power of the Nazis, so it took considerable boldness from Pountney to update it for our times. Dating from Weill's flight from European highbrow to American middlebrow, this is the tale of two lovers whose wedding plans are disrupted when their livelihood, a cow, is confiscated to pay taxes levied during a phoney arms race with the neighbouring nation. The programme's lists of military dictators and 'senseless' wars offer a none-too-subtle hint that this is now intended as a commentary on Bush, Blair and Iraq; but satire needs to be less slapstick to pack the requisite punch. A non-political brothel scene with a stylishly kinky madame from Beverley Klein is the show's zany high point. Mary Plazas and Leonardo Capalbo are winning as the lovers, with gallant support from Donald Maxwell and Robert Burt as the neo-Nazi bigwigs, Adrian Clarke as an arms trader and Jeffrey Lawton as the somnolent president. There is an incontinent cow and high-kicking chorus to bolster ON's reputation as the UK's prime champion of Weill. Vigorously conducted by James Holmes, the patchy score includes the original of Weill's 'September Song' among its few memorable numbers, alongside Latin dances and Offenbach-style finales garishly choreographed by Strictly Come Dancing's Craig Revel Horwood. Cautiously, the company is not taking this risqu\u00e9 show to Belfast this week, and is scheduling only one performance in each of its other touring venues alongside rather more of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro and Puccini's La Rondine. The latter remains in pristine shape, largely thanks to the central performance of Janis Kelly, still lustrous of voice if (like her character) with rather more of a past than back in 1994, when she created the role in this production. Kelly may be one of opera's most effective actresses, but her Magda looks a shade too mature to have Rafael Rojas's suave Ruggero and Peter Savidge's touching Rambaldo fighting over her. Francesca Zambello's delicate handling of the work's downbeat theme is, none the less, far more affecting than Covent Garden's recent vehicle for Gheorghiu and Alagna. Kelly's closing cry of pain, as her dashing young beau sends her back from the Riviera to her sugar daddy in Paris, signals the hopelessness of her quest for true love in a Second Empire France obsessed by grisettes and courtesans such as her Puccinian cousin Musetta and Verdi's Violetta. That she does not die prematurely, unlike Mimi, Tosca and Madama Butterfly, is less a reason for this work's second-class status in the Puccini canon than the score's failure, after its one big tune at the very beginning, ever quite to take off. But Gail Pearson and Alan Oke make the most of their sub-plot as the warring true-lovers Lisette and Prunier. And Bruno Schwengl's bright designs help turn this charming if musically slender piece into a perfect travelling-companion for Pountney's wacky panto."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
