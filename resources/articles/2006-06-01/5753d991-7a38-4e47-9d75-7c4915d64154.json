The Warhol prediction of \"famous for 15 minutes\" has turned out to be spookily accurate, and the old national lottery slogan that encouraged us to \"Think lucky\" has reinforced the trend. Yet I believe that an emerging backlash to this shallowness is a nagging doubt as to what is actually authentic and can be trusted. As Groucho Marx once famously said, he did not want to belong to any club which would have him as a member. I suppose that tried and tested brands should be more robust than any mere trend, and so more likely to be defenders of reliable standards. Last month at the PPA awards the Radio Times, Good Housekeeping and Country Living took the top honours. The Radio Times was born in 1923; Good Housekeeping launched in the UK in 1922 and Country Living is the baby, only starting out in 1985. The combined age of these three titles is 188 years, and they are among the most established quality titles in the country. But then the BBC and Nat Mags are clearly cornerstones in any discussion attempting to define which media brands have integrity and stamina. In the case of the Radio Times, it is particularly praiseworthy for having the guts and belief to reinvent itself, in an overly crowded TV listings magazine market. After all, the advent of the EPG (the handset television listings guide) and the many free guides dictate that it could be forgiven for giving up the will to exist any more at all. The editor, Gill Hudson, is someone I briefly worked with when she was at Dennis publishing launching Maxim magazine, and I am not surprised that this accolade has gone her way. Had it been up to me to decide the Radio Times' fate - and thankfully it was not - I would probably have chosen to divert funds to assets with better prospects. There are some other long-established media brands which do not enjoy the same confidence from their owners as the RT has, and may well suffer a debilitating decline as a consequence of calculated neglect. Uncharacteristically I bought the News of the World last Sunday and that is a title which is 163 years old. Perhaps more relevantly it virtually invented the modern blueprint of celebrity, sensationalism and gossip long before the likes of Hello!, Heat or Reveal were even a twinkle in their publishers' eyes. To be fair, the NoW is far from an intensive care case even today, boasting a market leading readership and enviable audience share. But it seems to me to be a tired newspaper format, trying to compete with a newer, shinier bunch of glossy rivals. It has been overtaken by more colourful, better marketed and conveniently packaged weekly alternatives through arguably hiding its greatest strengths because of a relatively lowly place in the News International pecking order. The NoW is often first to break scoops in its areas of expertise. (For example: stories of the abuses by senior Army officers against their more junior ranks in Iraq, and the Lib Dem MP Mark Oaten's dalliances with a rent boy.) Yet still it doesn't overtly blow its own trumpet much, despite having a brand character which should be brash, bold and gutsy. Is this a criminal waste of an oppor-tunity or just a symptom of its dispensability? It smacks of a cash cow running dry through being over-milked and starved of nourishment. This is ironic given that the red-top represents the seventh day of publishing following the six-day Sun. The latter enjoys almost limitless support and investment from NI and boasts an online multi-platform persona, promising a more healthy future. In the past 10 years the NoW's circulation has dropped from 4.6m to 3.6m, and its readership from 12.2m to 8.6m. (The title's heyday for circulation was in April 1951, when it hit around 8.5m copies.) These are still mighty impressive numbers, yet the decline is undeniable. This lack of imagination or apparent desire to develop the NoW seems to be a strange anomaly. It is the daddy of the celebrity phenomenon, and yet is apparently treated as a less favoured child. So will this declining asset enjoy the compliment of timely investment and refreshment from NI, will it be sold off, or simply allowed to sink without trace over the next few years? Mike Anderson, the new boss of the tabloid titles there, is brilliant. He is an agent for change and an advocate for exploiting new technologies, and it will be fascinating to watch how he deals with this big elephant in his room. If the answer is that there are more pressing issues, then perhaps they should bite the bullet and make the Sun a seven-day operation, thus quickly saving on duplicated overhead costs. That way at least it might spare its readers the indignity of witnessing a publicly painful and tortuous decline by an old and trusted friend. It's amazing what a Sean Bean voiceover can do The IPA (the advertising trade body) is debating with the client community the notion that marketing, and advertising in particular, is directly linked to the asset value of a brand. The tangible asset worth of a brand is often far short of how much that brand is worth, and the \"goodwill\", created largely through marketing, fills that void. O2, the network provider, was sold off by BT a few years ago and was recently sold on again for approximately \u20ac18bn. This was estimated to be more than the value of BT by some market experts at the time. I posed this question to David Arculus of O2 at a dinner in London, and he admitted that the contribution of the marketing community had been enormous. The campaign through VCCP is a through-the-line triumph of clarity and was the Grand Prix winner of the 2004 IPA effectiveness awards. A triumph if you like the Sean Bean depressing voiceover and blue bubbles, that is. It is therefore a dispiriting fact that when the economy slows down, it is the cost of marketing which is invariably chopped first. A budget yet to be spent is a tempting target for short termism but can be more damaging in the mid to long term. It would be prudent for analysts to ask more questions about how firms boost their brands when studying the numbers, as it is the eventual sale price or sustainable growing profits that are of most concern.
