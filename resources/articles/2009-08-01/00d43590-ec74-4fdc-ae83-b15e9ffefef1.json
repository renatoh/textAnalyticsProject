Fresh horseradish grows like a weed in the UK, so pester someone at your local farmers' market. It should be peeled and grated into small flakes. Wood sorrel is widespread across Britain. Although it contains oxalic acid, it is quite safe to eat in small quantities. If you can't source apple balsamic vinegar, use a good cider vinegar instead. Serves four Tartar: 500g musk ox or beef fillet Tarragon emulsion: 1\u00bd bunches of tarragon 100ml cold chicken stock 1 slice spelt bread, toasted and de-crusted 50ml balsamic apple vinegar (or cider vinegar) 1 shallot \u00bc clove of garlic 250ml grapeseed oil Juniper berry granulate: 1 tbsp of juniper berries \u00bd tbsp of coriander seeds \u00bd tbsp of caraway seeds Topping: 1 slice dark rye bread for croutons \u00bc horseradish root, grated 16 fine slices of shallot Lots of freshly picked wood sorrel L\u00e6s\u00f8-sydsalt (or Maldon sea salt) in flakes A bit of rapeseed oil To make the tartar, scrape the beef or musk ox fillet with a very sharp knife, along the length of the muscle tissue, so you get fine, long segments of meat. Ensure there are no sinews in the finished tartar. Keep in the fridge. For the emulsion, blend the tarragon leaves (not stalks), chicken stock, toast, vinegar and shallot into a fine mixture. Pour in the oil, a little at a time, while blending. Strain it through a fine mesh and pour it into a small squeezy bottle and refrigerate. Heat the spices for the granulate on a warm and dry pan over a low heat until they release a fragrant odour. Then crush them into a fine powder. Make the croutons by crumbling the dark rye bread into crumbs and lightly frying in rapeseed oil until crunchy. Transfer to some kitchen paper and use once cold. On the plates, spread the meat evenly in rectangles. Season well with salt. Sprinkle over the croutons, put a bit of the grated horseradish on top and drip a little rapeseed oil over the meat. Then cover the surface with leaves of wood sorrel, with shallot slices between the leaves. Smear the tarragon emulsion across one side of the plate, using the back of a spoon, and spread a little bit of the juniper berry granulate separately."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
