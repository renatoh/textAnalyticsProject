Spurs play City at White Hart Lane on Wednesday evening on the back of four successive victories in the Premier League that have left them fifth in the table and outside the top four only on goal difference. Sherwood's appointment has provided an upturn in form following some miserable results. Although Villas-Boas left Tottenham seventh and still within striking distance of European qualification places, a 6-0 defeat at the Etihad Stadium in November and a 5-0 loss at home to Liverpool proved fatal blows. Tottenham have conceded only two goals in their past five games and Sherwood believes his side have improved significantly. \"I watched that Man City game, because you need to watch it \u2013 as much as it is painful to see some of it,\" he said. \"A lot of the boys who are playing at the moment weren't even in the frame then. I think it was a freak result really. The team has improved itself. \"It's just giving some belief and confidence to the players. It's just putting my stamp on it and they've taken it on board and the results have been good. \"I wasn't there [at City], I watched it on TV. I think it was a real blow, the early goal \u2013 it was a freak goal really \u2013 and it just went on from there. To get beat is one thing but to get done by six is a real blow. \"What you don't want is a capitulation. Even if you go one behind you've got to stay in the game as long as you can because the tide can change very quickly; goals change games. Once it's two, three or four, it's important for your own pride not to get your head down and to stick with it.\" Sherwood, who won the Premier League as a midfielder with Blackburn Rovers, praised the Manchester City manager, Manuel Pellegrini, for adopting a 4-4-2 formation in an age when many sides in England play a single striker. The Spurs manager drew comparisons between City's team and the Rovers side who won the league in 1995, claiming \u00c1lvaro Negredo is a similar type of striker to Alan Shearer. \"He [Pellegrini] has made a mockery of the 'boring English 4-4-2',\" Sherwood said. \"People keep saying it's old hat but they're running away with the league playing that, just as [Manchester] United did for many years. \"I haven't studied Negredo as much as I knew Alan but if he can be anything like Alan then he won't do too badly. They both score every type of goal; they hold the ball up well. He is probably the most similar to Shearer as there has been in recent years.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
