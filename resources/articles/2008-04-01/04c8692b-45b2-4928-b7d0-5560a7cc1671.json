Despite rumours to the contrary, this year's Glastonbury festival will not be hijacked by Jay-Z and the hip-hop hordes. The official lineup, unveiled in the Guardian today, reveals that the New York rapper will be joined by the likes of Editors, Crowded House, Massive Attack, Elbow, Mark Ronson and Duffy. The festival's customary eyebrow-raiser will come in the shape of Shakin' Stevens, the Welsh Elvis lookalike of Green Door and This Ole House fame. Other acts down to perform at the three-day festival include Tunng, Eddy Grant, Solomon Burke, My Morning Jacket, and Fatboy Slim. The choice of Jay-Z as a headliner stirred controversy earlier this month, with some wondering what a hip-hop star was doing in the hallowed mud of Worthy Farm. Gallagher, the Oasis guitarist and songwriter, accused the organisers of messing with a winning formula and betraying the festival's roots. \"I'm sorry, but Jay-Z? No chance,\" he told the BBC. \"Glastonbury has a tradition of guitar music and even when they throw the odd curve ball in on a Sunday night you go 'Kylie Minogue?' \"I don't know about it. But I'm not having hip-hop at Glastonbury. It's wrong.\" Last night, Emily Eavis, who runs the festival with her father, Michael, said they were proud to have come up with such a varied and different bill. \"We think that we've got probably the most diverse lineup that we've ever had,\" she said. \"It's very eclectic and we're really over the moon about it to be honest. It represents so much music across the board. The John Peel stage represents most or all of what's been going on in British music over the last year.\" Eavis said that she and her father had \"a really good sense of what festivalgoers are after\", adding: \"The consensus seems to be that there is something for everyone.\" Eavis described Stevens as the latest in a long line of Glastonbury \"curve balls\" - including Rolf Harris and Dame Shirley Bassey - who have endeared themselves to the festival's fickle crowds. \"I'm sure it'll be great,\" she said. \"It'll be fine.\" Last month, Michael Eavis announced that this year's festival would continue the Glastonbury tradition of looking out for the environment by urging campers to use biodegradable tent pegs made of wheat and potato starch. Eavis said many of his cattle had been injured or killed after eating shards of metal pegs. \u00b7 The Guardian is sponsor of Glastonbury, which will be held on June 27, 28 and 29.
