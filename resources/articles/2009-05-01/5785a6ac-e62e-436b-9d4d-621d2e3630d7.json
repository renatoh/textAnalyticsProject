Look no further than Russian oligarch Vagit Alekperov, president of the giant Russian energy company Lukoil. Last year, Alekperov admitted that Lukoil had paid for the Russian translation of Klaus's book, Blue Not Green Planet, which spread the eccentric view that climate change is a myth. But now it is reported that Alekperov and Klaus have secretly met several times in Prague. So what does Klaus have to say? \"I appreciate the big help of Lukoil, and especially Vagit Alekperov.\" At least Klaus is even-handed. The English edition of the book was sponsored by rightwing American thinktank, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which used to be funded by Exxon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
