RUNNER-UP Wimbledon manager Neil Ardley \u2013 led his side to a retro 4-0 thumping of Portsmouth, and manfully retained his cool while being interviewed by Sky when an errant water sprinkler soaked him. FANS OF THE DAY It's not often that a League Two game has to turn punters away, but so many Portsmouth fans wanted to see the game that the club arranged a beam back at Fratton Park. VOLUNTEER OF THE DAY When You are the Ref comes to life, part 55. After the referee in Altrincham's Skrill North game at Colwyn Bay was injured with no reserve ref available, an appeal was made over the PA for a replacement. One volunteer was rejected because he \"smelt of alcohol\". The game was abandoned. BENEFACTORS OF THE DAY Rotherham won 3-0 at Stevenage, and had a big hand in the day's games elsewhere via their loanees. Danny Hylton secured a valuable point for Bury, while Kayode Odejayi scored the second in Accrington's win over Scunthorpe. BROKEN RUN OF THE DAY Not only were Leyton Orient knocked off the top of League One, but their 1-0 defeat to Preston was the first time they haven't scored in a league game this season. They were the last team to draw a blank in England's top five divisions. MANAGER OF THE DAY Kenny Jackett \u2013 taking advantage of Orient's slip to ease Wolves to the top, extending their unbeaten run to 11, and restoring some of their missing self-respect. MUST-HAVE GIFT Unveiled in Spain in time for Christmas: Gareth Bale caganers \u2013 traditional Catalan statuettes which depict celebrities defecating as symbols of \"fertilisation, hope and prosperity for the coming year\". SIGN OF THE TIMES Championship minnows Yeovil, auditioning an official Yeovil girl band to attract a new generation of fans, after realising their football might not do the job. The band will release a charity single and will play at home games."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
