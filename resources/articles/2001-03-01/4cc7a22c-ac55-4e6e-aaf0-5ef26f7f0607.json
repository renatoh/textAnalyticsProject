That is some cause for relief, given their inability to beat a Newcastle team so depleted that the manager Bobby Robson did not have a single defender to put on the bench. Robson told the former England captain Alan Shearer beforehand that he would have to switch to centre-half if one of the starting pair were injured. And with Everton's strikers so lacking in scoring form, he would doubtless have managed it standing on his head. It would have been amusing, though, to have seen Shearer arguing the case for the defence for once, having spent all game protesting to the referee David Elleray about the forwards' lot and the failure to award a penalty when he tangled with David Weir. Shearer was booked for following club instructions to stand in front of the ball to prevent opponents taking quick free-kicks, one such having caused Newcastle's defeat to Manchester City last week. And a player of lesser stature might have seen red for his protracted arguments over the late penalty that rescued Everton. Who does Shearer think he is? A Manchester United player? Robson said: \"He thought he should have had a penalty early on and then he began to get frustrated with the referee. It happens, but I suppose you are paid to suffer frustration.\" If Shearer really wants to understand the meaning of frustration, he should try standing in the shoes of Everton's manager Walter Smith, who once again saw his side miss outstanding chances to wrap up the game, finally leaving him relieved to salvage a point. Francis Jeffers, when he was fresh and hungry at the start of the season, would not have hesitated over his early chance, created by Thomas Gravesen and Kevin Campbell. But he struck his shot poorly and Shay Given made a comfortable save with his foot. Campbell missed another after Gary Naysmith courageously risked GBH from Andrew Griffin to get in his cross. Naysmith was carried off on a stretcher, followed by Alex Nyarko after a tussle just before half-time, and two minutes after the interval Everton's substitute David Uns- worth sliced the ball needlessly into his own net. Paul Gascoigne, out since November with a thigh injury, came on for Abel Xavier to try to produce some magic and, when Steve Caldwell was adjudged to have brought down Campbell, he picked up the ball as if to take the penalty. He was soon shoved off it by Michael Ball and Unsworth, who had a spat over whose right it was. Unsworth was successful in that one and just as successful with the kick, planting it into the bottom corner. \"He's very confident with his penalties,\" said Smith, who must wish he could say the same of his strikers in sight of goal. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
