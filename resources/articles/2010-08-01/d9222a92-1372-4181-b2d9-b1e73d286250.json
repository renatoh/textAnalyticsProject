I would say that my English is better than Gary Lineker's Spanish,\" Capello says, taking a swipe at one of the leading critics of his struggles with the language. \"I would also say that everyone thought my English was perfectly OK until we lost the game against Germany. One minute you are a fantastic coach, one defeat later you are a really bad man. I think this whole thing came out of just one interview. My English might not be good enough to talk politics but there is no difficulty if we are talking about football. The communication between myself and the players has always been really good. I absolutely deny there is any sort of problem.\" Fair enough, although good communication involves more than just picking up a new vocabulary. Capello has also been criticised, with some justification, for retiring David Beckham in a television interview and not picking up the phone himself when attempting to persuade Paul Scholes to reconsider his decision not to play for England again. Capello delegated his assistant, Franco Baldini, to ascertain whether the Manchester United player's position remained the same and, clearly unimpressed by Scholes saying it did and then subsequently letting it be known he might have changed his mind with a bit more notice, has just repeated the whole process with identical results. \"Scholes has told us he is too old to play for England,\" Capello says. \"I thought he might be about to change his mind but when Franco contacted him he said he didn't think he would be able to cope, at his age, with playing for the national team as well as Manchester United in the league and the Champions League. It's up to him, but I think the future for England is for the young players anyway.\" That being the case, and bearing in mind that Scholes will be 37 by the time the European Championship finals take place, there ought to be no way back for Beckham, either, yet conscious of his gaffe in treating a former captain and member of his World Cup staff with apparent disdain, Capello is now hedging his bets. \"First of all he needs to play, then we'll see,\" he says. \"I think he knows he is at a stage where his opportunities are limited, but the door is not closed.\" If Capello had said as much in ITV's studio he would have saved himself a lot of trouble, although the Italian can surely be forgiven for failing to foresee the storm that would break over his head just because he neglected to obtain Beckham's permission to call time on his England career. \"Franco called Beckham immediately after the television interview,\" Capello says. \"Then I called him myself. I spoke on the phone to him because he was part of my staff at the World Cup, usually I don't do that. He is an intelligent man, he might make a manager himself one day, and he understands that first he must recover from his injury. Our relationship is still good. In the television studio I was answering a question. What was I supposed to do? Break off the interview to call him on the phone?\" That would clearly have been ridiculous, and although it could be pointed out Capello had two days in which to contact Beckham between the recording of the interview and its transmission, it would have been almost as silly for a coach to go to such lengths for an injured 35-year-old who can work things out for himself. The more interesting question, if Beckham is as intelligent as Capello makes out and their relationship is still good, is why the future could not have been discussed during the long evenings in South Africa, or even on the slow journey home. To spend a month in close proximity to Beckham and then have such a public misunderstanding when the next tournament is getting under way suggests Capello's communications could be improved. Even Alf Ramsey, another England manager with a tendency to be aloof, nimbly prevented Geoff Hurst running away with the idea that he would represent his country forever. Saying goodbye after an England game, Hurst had the temerity to add: \"See you next time,\" to his manager to which Ramsey curtly replied: \"If selected, Geoffrey.\" Capello had been considering one new face in tonight's squad, if not the team to face Bulgaria. Due to the unavailability of Paul Robinson, who rather ungraciously retired as soon as Capello recalled him for the last friendly, he had offered a chance to \"the keeper of Fulham\". That's David Stockdale to you and me, the promising goalkeeper who helped keep United at bay last week. However, a turned ankle at Blackpool could rule him out. There will be no Mikel Arteta. \"He is not English, I cannot select him,\" Capello says. Whether this is a point of principle or a misreading of the Everton player's invitation to open a dialogue last weekend is not clear. While the FA are not pushing the matter, they believe it may be technically possible for Arteta to switch nationality, even if there would have to be a debate over the desirability of setting such a precedent. Capello does not even want to discuss the subject. \"He's Spanish,\" he says, with an air of unexpected finality. \"Please do not ask me about players I cannot pick.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
