As the home masses among a 21,000 crowd celebrated the League One club\u2019s second last-four appearance in a cup competition this calendar year \u2013 a rugged but deserved victory sealed by Marc McNulty\u2019s second-half tap-in \u2013 Koeman snubbed his touchline adversary, later citing inappropriate conduct during the match as his reason for it. \u201cI shake hands with people who have respect for me as a coach, who have respect for the fourth referee,\u201d said Koeman. \u201cThe behaviour of the bench of Sheffield United, I\u2019ve never seen that [before]. That was the reason why I didn\u2019t shake hands.\u201d Clough was particularly animated around the half-hour mark when the referee, Michael Oliver, played an advantage that was over almost before it began. He was still expressing his frustration to the fourth official, Paul Tierney, as Southampton received the first of five yellow cards on the night \u2013 Nathaniel Clyne bringing down Bob Harris in an advanced position adjacent to the penalty area. However, on another night of heady emotion in South Yorkshire, Clough insisted attention should not be deflected from the endeavour of his promotion-chasing League One team against a side that sat second in the Premier League just over a fortnight ago. \u201cThat\u2019s his opinion. I don\u2019t think one word should be said on it. We should talk about our lads \u2013 that\u2019s the story, not the manager,\u201d Clough said. \u201cThe 14 lads we put out there gave it absolutely everything and when you consider there were a couple of them from Ilkeston Town finishing the game \u2013 a 17-year-old started, a right winger played at right-back and a midfielder filled in at centre-half \u2013 it is a remarkable result.\u201d This was no smash and grab, though, and Koeman did not contest the fairness of the result as United claimed a fourth top-flight scalp of 2014. Their second semi-final in the space of nine months \u2013 following a Wembley defeat to Hull in April \u2013 will be played over two legs in January. \u201cIt\u2019s cup football and it\u2019s not about the level. It\u2019s not the first time and it\u2019s not the last time a League One club will beat a Premier League team. That\u2019s football. You have to bring more quality on the pitch and we didn\u2019t. With all due respect, they made it very difficult for us and they deserve it because they got the best chances in the game,\u201d Koeman added. Southampton\u2019s fifth consecutive defeat could and perhaps should have been by a wider margin. While Mark Howard, United\u2019s goalkeeper, was forced into only one serious save, kicking away Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s 70th-minute effort at his near post, his opposite number, Fraser Forster, was inundated with work, particularly in the second half of a spiky contest. Jamie Murphy, whose trickery proved a constant problem to the visiting defence, hacked wide unmarked at the far post, then forced Forster to claw away a curving delivery that passed through a posse of bodies towards the bottom corner. Moments later, Michael Doyle stung the goalkeeper\u2019s palms after timing his burst on to the edge of the area to perfection. Then, just after the hour, came the decisive moment. When, with the blood up, the home support roared for a penalty for Man\u00e9\u2019s trip on Louis Reed, they were disappointed. But not for long. Up stepped Harris, whose powerful low drive squirmed out of Forster\u2019s grasp and offered Scottish striker McNulty the chance to convert from a yard and write his name on to United\u2019s extraordinary list of modern cup success. Clough has lost just two of 18 ties since taking over at Bramall Lane and this humbling of a Southampton side now looking a pale shadow of the one that won 11 times in 12 games earlier this season followed eliminations of three other top-flight opponents \u2013 Aston Villa, Fulham and West Ham \u2013 in 2014. Southampton\u2019s misery was compounded in the last minute when Florin Gardos was dismissed for a professional foul on McNulty. It is fair to say, Koeman has had better days."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
