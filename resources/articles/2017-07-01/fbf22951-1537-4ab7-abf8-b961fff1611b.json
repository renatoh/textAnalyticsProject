It rated them all as providing \u201cinadequate\u201d care. Highcroft Manor in Northamptonshire A two-day unannounced inspection by inspectors in March led to the watchdog placing the home, which mainly looked after older people who had dementia, in special measures. They found a \u201csystematic failure in all areas of assessment and monitoring of people\u2019s care, resulting in risks to people\u2019s health and wellbeing\u201d. Residents were monitored too little given their health needs, and nurses did not always act promptly when a resident developed abnormal clinical symptoms. Staff did not give people their medication on time, manage their wounds properly or always help them eat and drink. \u201cPeople were at risk of infections as the home was not clean. People\u2019s rooms, bedding and flooring were visibly dirty,\u201d the CQC found. \u201cStaff were not always kind. People did not always have the ability to call for assistance and staff had little time to talk or support people with activities or socialising. Care ... did not always respect their dignity.\u201d The home\u2019s owners have been given six months to instigate major improvements or risk having their registration with the CQC cancelled. Crawfords Walk in Chester In June the CQC was scathing in its criticism of Bupa, which runs the Crawfords Walk nursing home, after a Channel 4 Dispatches documentary exposed series of failings at the facility. Andrea Sutcliffe, the CQC chief inspector of adult social care, was appalled at \u201cshocking evidence\u201d of understaffing, bad practice and poor care. \u201cThe examples of poor care and a culture of inappropriate, institutionalised practice highlightd by this programme are wholly unacceptable,\u201d she said. \u201cBupa has betrayed the very people it is paid to look after.\u201d Inspectors found that people were forced to wait to go to the toilet and that as a result some had soiled themselves. Some residents had still not had their breakfast by 11am. Staff got some residents out of bed to be washed and changed as early as 5.15am, so that it was \u201ceasier\u201d for staff to look after them. Some were then put back to bed. One nurse told Dispatches how she had to get people up at 3.30am to give them bed baths. Incontinence pads were rationed in the home and some soiled ones reused. A care assistant was filmed shouting at a resident who had filled her incontinence pad, telling her that \u201cyou\u2019re full of crap again\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re so naughty\u201d. Meadowbrook Care Home in Shropshire Inspectors found ants crawling over one of its dining tables and a soiled mattress. They observed staff not helping a resident who was struggling to eat, even though food was spilling into their lap. One resident told inspectors that they sometimes had to wait for an hour before staff responded to their calls for help. Aamina Homecare in Lincolnshire The CQC rated it as \u201cinadequate\u201d in April, though a previous inspection in April 2015 had found it to be \u201cgood\u201d. Residents assessed as needing 30 or 45 minutes of support received help for as little as six minutes. Staff administered medicines unsafely and at the wrong times. One person who should have had drugs every four hours instead received them all at once. One person had 19 different carers in a month, which exposed them to neglect. Another resident who needed two staff to support them from bed with personal care and getting dressed went without any help at all for two days."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
