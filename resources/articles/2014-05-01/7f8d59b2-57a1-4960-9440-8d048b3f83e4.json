Surely no team has overcome anything more than a five-goal deficit on the final day to send another team down?\u201d Norwich, you may have noticed, did not manage a 17-goal swing or, indeed, even a victory on the final day, so the Canaries will be playing Championship football next season. When it comes to the greatest deficits overturned, however, there are several notable instances and a few astonishing non-relegation-related final day turnarounds. First though to a final-day Houdini act from the Bundesliga in 1998-99. Here\u2019s Rob Smyth in his Joy of Six: great escapes to explain: With four games to go, a deficit of four points seemingly made Frankfurt, er, dead meat, but three wins in a row gave them hope. Not much, mind: to have any chance of survival on the final day they needed to beat Kaiserslautern, who themselves needed a point to qualify for the Champions League, and if results went against them they might have to win by as many as five goals. Either way, with the score at 1-1 with 20 minutes to go, Frankfurt were struggling. At that stage, their best hope was to overtake N\u00fcrnberg. Because they were losing 2-0 at home to Freiburg, Frankfurt would stay up with a 4-1 win. Amazingly they got three goals in 12 minutes \u2013 but then, in the 86th minute, N\u00fcrnberg pulled one back in their game, which meant Frankfurt were now going down on goal difference. No matter: straight away, Jan Aage Fjortoft (yeah, him) scored to make it 5-1. Frankfurt stayed up, not on goal difference but goals scored, and N\u00fcrnberg \u2013 who started the day four places off relegation, and who with 15 minutes to go knew they would definitely stay up unless Frankfurt and Hansa Rostock both scored at least twice \u2013 were down. Stephan Wijnen directs us to the qualifying stages of Euro 1984. Holland\u2019s 2-1 win over Spain in November 1983 put the big beasts of Group Seven level on points with one game each left to play. And, due to the sort of scheduling common sense we\u2019ve come to know and love from football\u2019s decision makers, both of those final games were at home against Malta, with Holland first on 17 December and Spain four days later. The Dutch team\u2019s goal difference was already six goals better than the Spaniards\u2019, so the 5-0 win for Kees Rijvers\u2019 side in Rotterdam left Spain needing an 11-goal margin of victory against the Maltese minnows to edge out the Dutch on goals scored. \u201cPrior to the game Malta\u2019s goalkeeper John Bonello dismissed Spain\u2019s chances saying \u2018Spain couldn\u2019t even score 11 against a team of children,\u201d writes Jeff Lawrence. \u201cAnd at half-time Bonello\u2019s prediction looked to be correct as the score was only 3-1 to Spain thanks to a hat-trick from Santillana of Real Madrid. P\u00f3li Rinc\u00f3n of Betis made it 4-1 just after half-time then added another 10 minutes later. After another five minutes had passed Sporting Gijon\u2019s Antonio Maceda scored twice in a minute and Rinc\u00f3n completed his hat-trick a minute later, making the score 8-1. Spain still needed another four goals in the remaining 26 minutes. By the 78th minute both Santillana and Rinc\u00f3n had taken their goal tallies to four, then Manu Sarabia made it 11-1 in the 80th minute. The 12th arrived from Juan Antonio Se\u00f1or (who had missed a first-half penalty) five minutes from the end. Although many people questioned the validity of the game in the Netherlands, the media and Dutch national team were pretty much magnanimous in defeat and declared Spain\u2019s win to be fair and above board. Rijvers pointed out that \u2018there are also miracles in football\u2019. The Dutch media saved their criticism for Bonello, the Maltese goalkeeper, and his defence.\u201d Spain, under Miguel Mu\u00f1oz, would go on to finish up as runners-up to the Michel Platini-inspired hosts France, but an even more remarkable final-day scoreline 16 years later sadly led to no such finals success for Scotland\u2019s women\u2019s side, as pointed out by Joe Murphy. Group E was a lopsided affair. Scotland and Czech Republic dominated Estonia and Lithuania to an extent that, after a 1-1 draw between the top two in a game that was the Czechs\u2019 last fixture and Scotland\u2019s penultimate match, the Czechs were top with a record of P6 W4 D2 L0 G37 A2 and Scotland three points back with a record of P5 W3 D2 L0 G21 A3. Normally that would\u2019ve been that, but Scotland\u2019s final game came against the group\u2019s whipping girls Lithuania, who had lost their two games against the Czechs with an aggregate score of 21-0. A 17-0 win in Glasgow would be enough to take them through. You can see where this is going. Scotland were 2-0 up within four minutes but only (only!) 6-0 ahead at half-time. In the second half they stepped on the gas and the score was 16-0 with 10 minutes to go. Then, out of nowhere, the Lithuanian side discovered how to defend. Scotland could not find that vital 17th goal. \u201cThere were a few opportunities I should have taken and I was starting to think we weren\u2019t going to do it,\u201d the Scotland striker Julie Fleeting told the Daily Record, \u201cand after scoring 16 goals that would have been hard to take.\u201d As it was, in the 93rd minute Fleeting rose to meet a cross and nodded in the 17th, breaking the hearts of what by that stage must have been an apoplectic Czech side. Even so, it was not enough to take Scotland to the 1999 World Cup. The complex qualifying system \u2013 stick with us \u2013 meant that the Scots, as group winners in the second tier of qualifying, then had to play-off against Spain, who finished bottom of a top-tier group, for the chance to enter the top tier of qualifying \u2013 the tier that actually meant the side could reach a World Cup \u2013 ahead of the 2003 finals. They lost 7-1 and Scotland still haven\u2019t reached the finals of a major tournament. And to finish, let\u2019s return to the original premise \u2013 a five-goal swing relegation escape. Here\u2019s Colin Beveridge: \u201cIt\u2019s the last day of the 1958-59 season and the bottom of the Scottish First Division \u2013 the top flight, in those days \u2013 is desperately tight: any one of five teams could join Queen of the South in the relegation zone. Raith Rovers and Stirling Albion aren\u2019t mathematically safe, although with 28 points and superior goal averages, it would take ridiculous scores all round to send them down. Aberdeen, fourth from bottom, are on 27 points, and need to beat Rangers to guarantee safety, while Rangers need to win to guarantee the championship. With a decent goal average, a draw is likely to be enough for Aberdeen, barring miracles. Third from bottom are Falkirk, on 26 points, with a goal average of 0.727 (56/77), while Dunfermline are in the last relegation spot, also on 26 points, with a goal average of 0.674 (58/86). I\u2019ll do the maths so you don\u2019t have to: if Aberdeen avoid defeat and Falkirk beat Raith, Dunfermline will need to better their result by at least five goals to avoid the drop. \u201cAberdeen, naturally, win against Rangers, who win the league in any case, as Celtic lose to Hearts. Falkirk also win 1-0, despite missing a late penalty, and end up with a goal average of 0.740. And Dunfermline take the sensible precaution of beating Partick Thistle 10-1, boosting their goal average to 0.782, and sending Falkirk down.\u201d COMING SOON: WORLD CUP SPECIALS The quadrennial Knowledge World Cup specials are imminent, so send your World Cup-related questions to knowledge@theguardian.com NERDVANA KLAXON: TRANSFER GDP \u201cDivided equally amongst the population of Wales, Gareth Bale\u2019s \u20ac100m transfer few would net his countrymen and women a tidy \u20ac32.64 (\u00a326.77 at time of writing) each,\u201d totted up Nick Read last week. \u201cHas there ever been a transfer that would prove more financially beneficial to the individual inhabitants of the transferee\u2019s home country?\u201d Extremely random, apropos of nothing, entirely irrelevant to the world\u2019s understanding of the game, an essentially pointless muddle of statistics \u2026 yep, it\u2019s no wonder this question saw a deluge of emails flooding into the Knowledge inbox. The frontrunner, suggested by many readers, was Liechtenstein\u2019s Mario Frick. \u201cBased on the assumption that he\u2019s from Liechtenstein and not Switzerland (he has shared citizenship and has played 113 times for the principality),\u201d begins Mark Poole, \u201chis \u00a32.2m transfer from Hellas Verona to Ternana in 2002 represents \u00a360.64 for each of Liechtenstein\u2019s 36,281 inhabitants. Not that they need it, of course.\u201d Then we wandered into dangerously political territory. \u201cBut what is a country?\u201d added Mark. \u201cGreenland is an autonomous country within the kingdom of Denmark, whatever than means. Population 57,000. Jesper Gronkjaer was born in Nuuk, and, of course, Chelsea paid \u00a37.8m for him. \u00a3136.84 per Greenlander.\u201d Similar thoughts were expressed over the New Caledonia-born Christian Karembeu (subject of an \u00a311m move to Real Madrid), Jersey\u2019s Graeme Le Saux and Gibraltar\u2019s Danny Higginbotham. But a hat-tip is owed to Dave Willbe who brilliantly took the question into even geekier territory and found the best answer of the week. \u201cI originally wanted to categorise \u2018financially beneficial\u2019 as a percentage of GDP per person rather than the absolute size of the theoretical handout,\u201d he begins unpromisingly. \u201c\u00a326.77 is not to be sniffed at, but it\u2019s only 0.17% of Wales\u2019s \u00a315,401 of GDP per person. GDP per capita in Togo is just $1,100, so although Emmanuel Adebayor\u2019s \u00a325m transfer to Manchester City would have netted each resident only \u00a33.40, that\u2019s a big 0.52% of GDP per person \u2013 literally three times as \u2018financially beneficial\u2019 for each resident. \u201cAs it turns out, there\u2019s no need to do that thanks to Montserrat international Ruel Fox\u2019s \u00a34.25m transfer from Newcastle to Spurs. As Montserrat has a population of just 5,215, that works out to \u00a3814.96 per head. It\u2019s also a chunky 16% of GDP per person. This is without adjusting for inflation or population growth, both of which would \u2026\u201d I think we\u2019ll leave it there, Dave. CLUBS WHO HAVE NEVER WON A THING (2) Last week we looked at the teams with the world\u2019s dustiest trophy cabinets. Here\u2019s Philip Farrell with another couple of names for the list \u2026 \u201cMonaghan United in Ireland were founded in 1975 and folded in 2012. In their entire 37-year history, which included prolonged stints in the Irish Premier Division, Monaghan fans never saw their team win anything, and now they never will. Meanwhile in Italy, USD Novese, currently of Serie D/A, were crowned Italian champions in the 1921-22 season, but have failed to win a single trophy since. That puts their suffering fans at a 92-year wait for a trophy.\u201d KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE \u201cIs Osmo Tapio Everton R\u00e4ih\u00e4l\u00e4 the only composer in classical music who has dedicated his work to a football team and their players?\u201d wondered Aki Niemi in Finland back in the olden days of 2007. Incredibly, the answer is no. But before we get on to other composers, we let Aki divulge a little more information on the aforementioned Mr R\u00e4ih\u00e4l\u00e4: \u201cHe is a composer who gets inspiration from \u2013 among other things \u2013 football, in particular his beloved Everton. He has made a special Everton series of compositions, with pieces of art including [Nick] Chadwick Drive and Barlinnie Nine. The latter is the concluding part of the Everton series and as its name suggests, it\u2019s dedicated to Duncan Ferguson [Barlinnie being the prison of the same name]. The premiere of Barlinnie Nine was on April 20 in Helsinki, performed by the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra and, incredibly, later that night Duncan Ferguson scored the only goal of the game in Everton\u2019s win over Manchester United.\u201d Spooky indeed. But it isn\u2019t just the Toffeemen who have had beautiful music written about them. QPR fan and composer extraordinaire Michael Nyman has used the Hoops as his muse, as he explained: \u201cThe Final Score was composed in 1991 for a Channel 4 film directed by Matthew Whiteman, which (delightfully) allowed me to drift from the Queens Park Rangers of the (then) present back to the golden days of the Stan Bowles-inspired team of the mid 70s. The score is a straightforward set of variations of a four-note bass line and is anthemic enough to lift QPR immediately back into the Premier League.\u201d But, in true Jimmy Cricket tradition, there\u2019s more. Steven Rajam brought David Golightly\u2019s Symphony No1 to our attention, an opus dedicated to Middesbrough, or, more specifically, \u201cSteve Gibson, the players and staff\u201d. And, as Ed Vulliamy wrote back in March 2000: \u201cDmitri Shostakovich, the greatest composer of the twentieth century, was a football fanatic. He was, said Maxim Gorky, \u2018a rabid fan. He comported himself like a little boy, leapt up, screamed and gesticulated\u2019 at matches. Shostakovich supported Leningrad Zenith; he would cut short his composing retreats in some rural idyll and return to the city for home games.\u201d Euan Bolton threw his hat into the ring, adding: \u201cHow about the V/V/M 7\u201d, which paid tribute to the 1997 Dortmund team?\u201d And, albeit moving slightly out of the classical genre, Finley Quaye\u2019s \u2018Maverick A Strike\u2019 album is apparently dedicated to his beloved Hibernian, while Austrian band Fanclub Erdberg made \u2018Anton Polster Du Bist Leiwand\u2019, a rough translation of which is \u2018Tony Polster: You Are A Legend\u2019. For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive. CAN YOU HELP? \u201cTim Sherwood revealed last weekend that he regretted taking the Spurs job,\u201d writes Rod Pithouse. \u201cBut I can\u2019t remember any youth-team coach at a club turning down promotion to the big chair. Has anyone ever done it?\u201d \u201cHas a stand-by World Cup squad player ever got into the 23-man squad as a result of injuring the player in his position during a pre-World Cup training camp?\u201d wonders Christopher Mason. \u201cThere is some sort of chance that at some point next season, there will be no English manager in the Premier League,\u201d writes Gus Worth. \u201cHas this ever happened anywhere, that there was no national manager at the top tier of a national league?\u201d \u201cMuch was made this season of the number of times that the Premier League leadership changed hands \u2013 25 times \u2013 and the low number of days that the eventual champions, Manchester City, held the lead \u2013 15 days,\u201d begins Dr David Sweeting. \u201cThese figures take no account of games in hand. How different would these figures be if they were calculated after each club had played the same number of games?\u201d \u201cReading the story in last week\u2019s edition about Davy Wathne\u2019s pledge to walk from Bergen to Oslo, and bearing in mind Piers Morgan\u2019s similar promise to quit Twitter if Liverpool were to finish above Arsenal in the season just concluded, I wondered if there were any more stories of journalists making rash promises to perform unlikely feats if given football results were to occur?\u201d writes Justin Horton. \u201cI was watching Benfica v Manchester United, in the 1968 European Cup final,\u201d begins David Cormack. \u201cAfter Gra\u00e7a scores, the commentator mentions that \u2018Just as he turned off the electricity during the incident a few years ago in their bath he has saved them now in this cup final.\u2019 Can the Knowledge cast any light on what this incident was?\u201d \u201cIn last week\u2019s piece you mentioned how Benfica managed to come second in three competitions last season,\u201d wrtites Matt Cooke. \u201cThis is nothing compared to the unfortunate streak they extended by losing the Europa League final, as they have now lost their last eight European finals. What other impressive cup final losing streaks are out there? And can any of them beat Benfica?\u201d \u201cThe club I support \u2013 Lye Town in the West Midlands \u2013 were founded in 1930 and, although they won two long-forgotten minor locals cups up to four seasons ago, had the rare distinction of never having been promoted or relegated in their entire history \u2026 until this season,\u201d begins Max Hall. \u201cJoint managers Martin Thomas and Darren Goodall and chairman Brian Blakemore ushered in a unparalleled era of success for The Lye (no one has ever referred to them by their \u2018official\u2019 nickname \u2013 The Flyers), with three cups arriving in successive seasons and culminating in this season\u2019s double of a first victory in the Worcestershire Senior Urn and promotion from the West Midlands Regional League to the Midland Football Alliance (eight seasons below the Premier League). We did transfer from the Worcestershire Combination to the stronger Birmingham Combination (which eventually became the WM League) some time in the 30s. But does 84 years of playing at the same level make us the most boring team in history?\u201d \u201cViborg finished bottom of the Danish Superliga, but had the league\u2019s leading scorer, Thomas Dalsgaard, in their ranks,\u201d writes Lars Bogegaard. \u201cIs it unprecedented for a league\u2019s top scorer to get relegated?\u201d Send your questions and answers to the lovely people at knowledge@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
