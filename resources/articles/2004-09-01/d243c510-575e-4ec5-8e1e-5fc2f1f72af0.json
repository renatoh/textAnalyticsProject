Two showbiz stars - one in opera - earned the term this week. The conductor Riccardo Muti pulled out of seven Verdi performances at the Royal Opera House after the London company slightly altered the set of the Italian's imported La Scala production. And, on the same day, TV footage showed Sir Elton John in Taiwan, furious in a blue tracksuit at being asked to wait in line to show his passport after landing in his private jet. These off-stage arias are examples of what is known, in another showbiz euphemism, as \"artistic temperament\". Most star performers - whether in pop, opera, theatre or movies - eventually have such an outburst, raising the question of whether the temperamental become artists, or the artists become temperamental. Certainly, there is a recognisable type. The Conservative politician Richard Luce, who served in the Foreign Office and the arts ministry, remarked on the different temperaments he witnessed. When a theatre director thumped the minister's desk and spoke of a \"catastrophe for the entire civilised world\", it meant that the grant to the Shrewsbury Playhouse had fallen behind inflation; while an FO official's murmur about a \"little local difficulty\" might refer to a dictator slaughtering a thousand British passport-holders. Neither of these reactions - emotionally overblown and emotionally stunted - is ideal, but they follow from the kind of personalities who are drawn to Rada and the diplomatic service. Although members of the performing professions are obviously interested in showing off, this often comes not from a sense of their importance, but of worthlessness. Alcoholics have been defined as egomaniacs with low self-esteem, and showbiz stars (many of whom are heavy drinkers) are a classic illustration of this paradox. Living for applause on stage, they crave the same buzz when the show is over. Illegal substances are the most notorious substitute, but status also becomes a sort of alternative applause: the stretch limousine an ovation, the freshly painted dressing room an encore, the no-wait airport immigration an award for your importance. Knowing nothing of Riccardo Muti's private appetites, I would guess that his favourite narcotic is deference. Until a recent democratic correction by the younger generation, conductors have traditionally mainlined on inflated acclaim. And this touches on the other explanation for celebrity temperament: they behave like kings because they are treated like kings. This can be seen in the Royal Opera House's statement of regret that \"Maestro Muti\" has fallen out with them over the size of the set's walls. It's possible that this opera-house honorific is being used facetiously, but it is just as likely that Muti expects and receives it without irony. The British honours system has proved that calling people \"Lord\" or \"Sir\" often leads them to believe that they have superior DNA, and so the consequences of addressing someone as \"Maestro\", a distinction given to far fewer, can easily be imagined. Though Reg Dwight became Elton John and then Sir Elton, there is no pop equivalent of \"maestro\", except, possibly, \"she\", as in \"Listen to what she's asking for now!\" - a phrase more commonly used of male stars than, say, Madonna. But what's interesting about Sir Elton's Taiwanese heebie-jeebies is that he has recently presented himself as someone in recovery from self-obsession. He jokes on chatshows about the time when, overblown on coke, he phoned down from a suite at the Paris Ritz and ordered the concierge to stop the rain outside his window. Now clean of drink and drugs, Sir Elton wrote a song called \"Ego\" (mocking his previous self-love) and took part in a documentary called Tantrums and Tiaras, shot by his partner David Furnish, in which he again drew a separation between the Elton who looked out of the bottom of pills and drink bottles and the new improved one. Ominously, however, even this portrayal included a scene in which the star stormed off a tennis court after a member of the public waved at him. What caused the to-do, Elton explained, was that the woman had shouted, \"Yoo hoo!\" And now we discover that Sir Elton's mocking of his past star demands does not extend to queuing at immigration with ordinary people. This is partly a result of his personality, but also of 35 years of being encouraged to think that he's a special kind of person. The behaviour of Sir Elton and Maestro Muti makes clear that, even if Britain became a republic, we would still be the subjects of the true royalty of our times: showbiz stars."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
