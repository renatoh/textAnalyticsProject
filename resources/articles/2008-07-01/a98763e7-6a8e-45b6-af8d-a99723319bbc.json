Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who top the MediaGuardian 100 list, epitomise the new face of power in the advertising industry and also take the top spot in the advertising top 10. Microsoft's ambition to break Google's stranglehold on the digital advertising market, its audacious bid to snap up Yahoo for $47.5bn (\u00a323.9bn) the most headline-grabbing signal, sees the Microsoft chief executive, Steve Ballmer, a new entrant at number two in the ad list. Sir Martin Sorrell, a man who has labelled Google as a \"frenemy\" - meaning it can be seen both as a partner and a competitive threat - has dropped a place in the advertising top 10 to third. However, Sorrell has raced up the overall MediaGuardian 100 list to number 13. He was ranked 43 last year and 23 in 2006. But now he has put last year's distracting libel action behind him, secretly remarried, and can focus on the small matter of trying to buy research firm TNS for around \u00a31bn. This year has seen a shakeup in the middle ranks of the advertising top 10. New entrants in the MediaGuardian 100 include the outrageously talented ad man Juan Cabral, a creative partner at agency Fallon, in at number four. The diminutive Argentinian has been the brains behind some of the best work to come out of the UK in recent years including Cadbury's \"Gorilla\", which picked up the top award at the Cannes International Advertising Festival, and the \"Balls\", \"Paint\" and \"Play-Doh\" ads for Sony Bravia. The Fallon chief executive, Robert Senior's star has also been very much in the ascendancy, and he enters the advertising power list at number five. Senior's outstanding leadership of Fallon, not to mention a firm grasp of PR to get the message out, has firmly marked him out as something of a saviour by parent company Publicis Groupe. Last year, he was appointed as UK chief executive of SSF, the \"mini group\" consisting of Fallon and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, with the unenviable task of reviving the once top-notch pedigree of one of advertising's most well known agencies. Advertising stalwart Trevor Beattie, best known for his work for FCUK and Wonderbra, takes sixth spot in the advertising top 10. The meteoric rise and continued Midas-like touch of David Jones, the youthful global chief executive of Euro RSCG, keeps him in the list at number seven this year. And the see-saw battle between Maurice Levy, the chief executive of Publicis Groupe, and arch-rival Sorrell keeps adland on its toes and puts the Frenchman at number eight. Vincent Bollor\u00e9 holds a 32.9% stake in Havas and his pursuit of UK media buying group Aegis has kept the French corporate raider high on the advertising industry radar. Bollor\u00e9, who controls 29.9% of Aegis, is almost certain to strike in the not too distant future, possibly later this year, a move which is likely to bring in the ever-acquisitive Sorrell to look at Aegis's research arm Synovate. No advertising power list could be complete without Farah Ramzan Golant, the chief executive of the UK's largest ad agency, Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO. Golant is not only one of the most powerful women in communications but one of the advertising industry's senior figures. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
