This week, there are two, one of a certain merit from the States, the other an execrable British film (Colin). The American film, Cirque de Freak, is handsomely mounted and relatively ambitious in trying to reinvent the genre by juxtaposing life-enhancing vampires with death-dealing \"vampaneze\" through the story of two Los Angeles teenagers who join different sides. Based on a series of books by Darren Shan, it's infinitely more inventive than the sweetly romantic Twilight books aimed at the vulnerable jugulars of teenage girls and clearly intended to launch a new cinematic franchise. It is, however, a rather muddled affair redeemed by striking performances from John C Reilly, Michael Cerveris and the imposing Ken Watanabe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
