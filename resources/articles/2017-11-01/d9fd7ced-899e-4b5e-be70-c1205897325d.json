This, intriguingly, was not about flogging tickets. Both men already knew their WBA and IBO super-middleweight unification contest had sold out in seven minutes earlier on Tuesday morning. This was about squeezing and teasing potential pressure points before their fight in front of nearly 20,000 people at the Manchester Arena on 17 February \u2013 and both men were intent on causing more than superficial damage. \u201cYou\u2019re an old man,\u201d Eubank Jr sneered at his rival. \u201cYou\u2019re not the fighter you used to be. You are pretty average, you don\u2019t have much speed, your defence is poor and your stamina is lacking. You can\u2019t compete with me. I am too young, too fresh, too powerful, too quick and too good.\u201d The evisceration had barely got started. \u201cThis is my time,\u201d he continued. \u201cI am a different animal to a year or two ago but George is the same guy. I know what happened in training and when we sparred together \u2013 I know all about George as a fighter and a man. I know his weaknesses and strength. He will not handle the fire and the heat.\u201d Then came the prediction: his opponent would not hear the bell for the 12th round. Groves, by turn, smiled and smirked and aggressively countered \u2013 not only questioning his opponent\u2019s pedigree but his relationship with his father, Chris Sr, who he suggested cared more about fame than about his son. \u201cEubank\u2019s camp are totally deluded,\u201d Groves said. \u201cHe is fighting in a division he doesn\u2019t belong in. He is a middleweight who punches from his hips with his chin up in the air. He\u2019s terrific for a soundbite. It\u2019s made him Instafamous but this is different.\u201d Groves knows the public and bookmakers make Eubank Jr a warm favourite but he believes they have been duped by his rival\u2019s padded CV and his bombastic behaviour, especially on social media. He protested, with some justification, that when it comes to size and boxing pedigree he has a definite edge. \u201cI used to hear other boxers talk about levels and it used to frustrate me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now I understand: sometimes it doesn\u2019t matter how much you prepare, there are just people you can\u2019t beat. Sorry for Junior he is not good enough and he doesn\u2019t have the pedigree. On the night I believe I\u2019m unstoppable and you won\u2019t see the 12th round. \u201cI\u2019ve won junior titles, ABA titles and boxed for England all over the world against future Olympic champions as an amateur \u2013 and then beat world-class fighters as a professional. People think he has phenomenal stamina, that I will fade and am going to get knocked out. He talks a good game. Let\u2019s see if we can believe it. When he is being beaten badly, how is he going to cope?\u201d As the war of words intensified, this onlooker\u2019s eyes were diverted to some of Eubank Jr\u2019s camp, who were wearing T-shirts with The Next Generation on them. It\u2019s an easy distinction to make: Groves, the ageing fighter, versus the coming man. However Eubank Jr at 28 is only a year younger than his opponent and has only three fewer fights on his CV. Groves has more mileage on the clock than his opponent \u2013 and later, away from the TV cameras, he was more reflective about how his 30 professional fights may have taken their toil. He acknowledged he suffered a \u201crocky two years\u201d after splitting with his trainer Adam Booth, during which time he lost twice to Carl Froch and then to Badou Jack, but insisted he had rebuilt and felt \u201cunstoppable\u201d since moving to be trained by Shane McGuigan. \u201cI am an old man and sometimes I struggle to keep up with some of the youngsters on the circuits,\u201d Groves said, smiling. \u201cBut at the same time, it is keeping me young. Fighting wise I feel rejuvenated and ready to roll.\u201d Sometimes it can be hard to decipher fact from fiction in boxing. But if Groves is right, then Eubank \u2013 and the bookies \u2013 could be in for a rude awakening."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
