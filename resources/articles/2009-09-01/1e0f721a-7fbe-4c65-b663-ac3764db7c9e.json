The Chelsea manager was a 20-year-old midfielder for Roma when he first felt the heat and hostility of such occasions, and one part of the experience has remained uncomfortably vivid. \"I have very bad memories,\" the Italian says. \"Because in my first derby, against Lazio in 1979, there was the death of a supporter. It was brutal.\" Vincenzo Paparelli was a 33-year-old Lazio fan. He suffered fatal injuries when a rocket fired by Roma ultras from the Olympic Stadium's Curva Sud hit him in the eye. His wife attempted to pull out the iron tube but, with the flare still burning, she simply hurt her hand. Ancelotti is a stranger to London derbies \u2013 upon his arrival at Chelsea in July, he had to ask his players to fill him in on the identity of their fiercest capital city rivals; the unanimous response was Tottenham \u2013 but he knows that nothing can compare to the malevolence of Roma v Lazio matches. Ancelotti described the Milan derby, in which he played and managed against Inter, as passionate but, mercifully, free of \"danger and violence\". Ancelotti is an unflappable character. He remarks that the game in England is more intense than it is in Italy, but he says he has not felt \"nervous\" in the dugout. Nor, he adds, has he grown angry with his players. \"I sit very quietly because I feel a very good sensation with them.\" It is only when he refers to Paparelli that his language becomes impassioned. He shrugs off the recent off-the-field turmoil at Stamford Bridge \u2013 the club has been banned from the next two transfer windows for making illegal inducements to the young winger Ga\u00ebl Kakuta and, in a separate development, Peter Kenyon has stood down as the chief executive. \"These things are not a problem,\" Ancelotti says. \"They have not influenced the team or the players, absolutely not. The players don't have a problem because it's not our question. We have to think about winning matches.\" Ancelotti's team have won all his six games so far, yet their progress has seen them slip under the radar to some extent. As the other members of the big four have already hit both highs and lows, and Manchester City and even Tottenham have demanded attention, Chelsea, give or take the last-minute winners against Hull and Stoke, have rolled on serenely. Since Jos\u00e9 Mourinho constructed a squad heavy on physical and mental power, Chelsea have perfected the art of grinding down opponents. Has much changed under Ancelotti? The steely cool of his character appears to be reflected by his team. When Roman Abramovich had grown frustrated with Chelsea's style of play at the end of the 2007-08 season, the club's owner told Ancelotti that they did not \"have a personality\". \"This is a team that, at the moment, I don't recognise,\" Abramovich added. Ancelotti was acutely aware that Abramovich was \"looking for a team with a precise identity, like Manchester United, Liverpool, Milan, certainly not like my Chelsea\". Yet two and a half months into his reign, Ancelotti believes that he is answering Abramovich's demand. \"I think that in the matches so far, the team has shown a precise identity, in terms of the precision of their play,\" he says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
