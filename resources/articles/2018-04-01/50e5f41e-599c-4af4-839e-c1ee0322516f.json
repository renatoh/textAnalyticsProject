Darting on to Mesut \u00d6zil\u2019s lofted pass, Ramsey jumped and, with the outside of his right boot, flicked a volley over the goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev and into the net. Ramsey\u2019s sublime touch gave Arsenal a 3-1 lead against CSKA Moscow after 28 minutes of a quick and purposeful first-half performance and set them fair for a place in the Europa League semi-finals \u2013 their shot at redemption in an endlessly trying season. Ramsey had opened the scoring and things would get even better for Arsenal. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger preferred the fit again Alexandre Lacazette to Danny Welbeck and the striker, who had scored his team\u2019s second from the penalty spot, made it four before half\u2011time with a precision finish. Wenger had said, with glorious understatement, there was \u201csome extra pressure on the team to do extremely well in this competition\u201d \u2013 what with it providing a possible route back into the Champions League \u2013 but they did not seem to feel it, save for a wobble when Aleksandr Golovin equalised. This was a convincing front-foot display, underpinned by \u00d6zil, who began the move for Ramsey\u2019s first goal and claimed the assists on the other three. The vibes feel more positive around the club, after a fifth successive victory in all competitions. Wenger has never won a European trophy. He is edging towards a decent shot, even if bigger beasts lie in wait. Wenger described the first half as \u201cspectacular and uncomfortable\u201d, which was a neat enough summary. Arsenal bristled with attacking menace but they looked shaky at the back, leaving gaps and riding their luck. CSKA came to play; they did not mass numbers behind the ball, which Wenger commended them for but mainly because it played into Arsenal\u2019s hands. \u00d6zil, in particular, revelled in the space. Ramsey had a strike disallowed for offside, following an \u00d6zil pass, but he made the breakthrough after nine minutes. \u00d6zil had probed for Jack Wilshere but it did not come off and so he zipped the ball out to H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn. The right-back\u2019s low cross was measured for Ramsey and he swept home. Ahmed Musa had raced clean through for CSKA after five minutes only to be pulled back by an offside flag, which looked harsh, while Arsenal\u2019s defending in the buildup to the equaliser featured a shanked clearance and Laurent Koscielny bundling into Golovin on the edge of the area. The midfielder picked himself up to curl a precision free-kick into the top corner. For a moment, there was panic and when Musa beat Granit Xhaka, he shot wastefully wide of the near post. Arsenal\u2019s game clicked at the other end and the CSKA back three of the Berezutski twins and Sergei Ignashevich came to look every one of their combined 108 years. The penalty was the turning point. \u00d6zil looked to have overrun the ball and he was stumbling when Georgi Schennikov slid in. The wing-back missed the ball but, after \u00d6zil went down, it still felt like a soft award. Lacazette coolly put away the spot-kick. If Ramsey\u2019s second was a gem, Lacazette\u2019s was nice in a lower key way. Xhaka fed \u00d6zil and, when he crossed, Aleksei Berezutski stretched, creaked and could not cut it out. Lacazette took a touch and drove low past Akinfeev. It might have been five before the interval but \u00d6zil lifted a shot high from the corner of the six-yard box following Xhaka\u2019s lovely ball. Wenger had selected his strongest available XI and that included Petr Cech ahead of the regular cup goalkeeper, David Ospina. The manager reported that Ospina had sprained his ankle in training and would be out for two to three weeks. He also lost Henrikh Mkhitaryan to a knee problem, which will rule him out of the Premier League home game against Southampton on Sunday and possibly longer. With the CSKA defence in disarray, Arsenal ought to have added to their tally. Ramsey had three second-half chances for a hat-trick, hitting the post with the final one, while Mkhitaryan, Alex Iwobi and \u00d6zil might have done better when well-placed. However, Arsenal look to have done enough."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
