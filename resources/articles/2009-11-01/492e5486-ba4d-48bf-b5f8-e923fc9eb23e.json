Gourlay took up his new role on 1 November, replacing Peter Kenyon, whom he followed from Manchester United to south-west London in 2004, to become the chief operating officer. He marked his first week in his new role by admitting the club's target to become self-sufficient by 2010 would not now be obtainable, though that remains the long\u2011term aim. The 46-year-old Scot said he considers Manchester United Chelsea's principal rivals and warned Manchester City, a rising force under the ownership of Abu Dhabi United Group, that they may not break easily into the \"big world\". \"Everybody has a different style,\" Gourlay said. \"People always say to me: 'You worked with Peter Kenyon for a long time,' but we're two completely different personalities and I do things different. Hopefully, if there was brashness there then maybe you won't see as much brashness going forward. You'll still see as much energy, you'll probably see more will to win with realistic goals. We've learned a lot in the last five years. \"I like to operate honestly but realistically. Self-sufficiency is still the goal of the football club. That's what we're trying to attain. Is it going to happen this year? No, but we're not that far away. It would be nice to go to the owner and say we don't need any more cash but that's not where we are today.\" Gourlay said the club would consider selling the naming rights for Stamford Bridge, adding: \"We understand that this is a sensitive issue for our fans and that is why we would keep the name Stamford Bridge in any deal.\" He is taking up the reins with the landscape of the Premier League altered by City's emergence, though Chelsea's main challengers for honours remain clear. \"Anybody who finishes above Manchester United will win the league,\" he said, with the champions due at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. \"I do see them as our biggest rivals. [City's threat is] something that we've got to deal with going forward. With the players they have, they're certainly going to try and push their way into the top five. Commercially, it's not that easy. They're very much a Manchester-centric club. To break into the 'big world' and start developing your business in Asia and the US, you need to really start winning some trophies, and not just one Premier League.\" Kenyon had set a target of winning two European Cups within a decade upon moving to Chelsea in 2004 during Roman Abramovich's first season. There have been five semi-final appearances in the last six seasons, and a final defeat on penalties to United in 2008. Gourlay remains confident the team, under the two-time winner Carlo Ancelotti, can break their duck. \"Over the next five years we've still got to shoot for the stars,\" he added. \"I'd still like to think we can win the Champions League twice in the next five years. That might sound aggressive, but I think we can still do it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
