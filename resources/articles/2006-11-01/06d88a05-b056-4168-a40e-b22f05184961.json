The Tories campaigned hard on immigration under Michael Howard in the 2005 election campaign but failed to defeat Labour. Since then, David Cameron has been seeking to portray a more compassionate image for the party and had almost taken the issue off the political agenda until today. The Conservatives said their ideas - presented in a 60-page policy paper by the shadow home secretary, David Davis, and immigration spokesman Damien Green - were both \"tough and thoughtful\". Mr David and Mr Green advocate an annual limit on non-EU economic migrants, designed to ensure that Britain's public services, infrastructure and housing can cope with the numbers coming to settle in the UK. The plans drop the idea that the annual limit should also apply to asylum seekers, a policy criticised at the time of the election as unlawful. But the home secretary, John Reid, today mocked the Tories for having a \"long period of silence\" on the issue. The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, claimed the Tories were \"doing the splits\" on immigration by talking tough to their membership while \"trying to sound reasonable\" to help Mr Cameron's image. Today's paper - which has been approved by Mr Cameron and is expected to form the basis for policy in the manifesto for the next general election - argues that the plans will maximise the economic benefit of migration to the UK by limiting access to those with in-demand skills. It does not estimate the annual limit which would be imposed on economic migrants, but said it would be \"significantly\" lower than the current level of about 200,000 a year. Mr Davis and Mr Green acknowledge their proposals would not apply to workers coming from new EU member states in eastern Europe, believed to have reached 600,000 since 2004 according to some estimates. The Tory proposals bring the party closer to the government's thinking on immigration than they have been in years. Today Mr Davis admitted that his proposals for deciding eligibility for admission would build on the government's plans for a points-based system giving priority to would-be migrants with skills. However, he said that his procedure for setting the annual limit on economic migrants would be more sophisticated than Mr Reid's planned migration advisory committee, as it would look not only at the economic impact of new arrivals, but also the social consequences. He also spoke about the importance of consensus on the issue. He: \"We believe that Britain would benefit if a consensus could develop about the best way to make sure that we benefit from migration. \"We also believe that a socially responsible immigration policy needs proper controls to build public confidence in the system. This is an attempt to help build that consensus.\" He dismissed suggestions that the plans might prove a vote-loser with core Tory supporters who want immigration shut off altogether. Under the plans, a two-stage process would first identify as eligible for admission those - such as entrepreneurs and skilled professionals like doctors - who are likely to contribute more to the economy than they take out. In the second stage, the government would consult each year with bodies including local authorities, housing providers and public services to set a ceiling on the number to be admitted. They would take into account the ability of the health and education services and the public infrastructure to cope with the additional people, the availability of housing, the likely environmental impact of population growth and the potential effects on community cohesion. The paper also repeats the Conservatives' call for a new unified border force, empowered not only to control movements through the UK's ports and airports, but also to track down and remove those who have overstayed their permission to remain in Britain. The UK Independence party claimed the Tory policy was inherently racist. The party's leader, Nigel Farage, said: \"The overall effect of such a policy is the imposition of a colour bar which favours the 450 million white Europeans who live in the EU. \"It also makes it increasing more difficult for those people hoping to come here to work from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and the Indian sub-continent.\" However, Sir Andrew Green, of pressure group Migrationwatch UK, said: \"This is an intelligent and well-judged paper. The direction is right, but the beef must follow.\" A spokesman for the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said it was important Mr Cameron recognised that \"just talking tough on immigrants does not help the immigration debate\". The spokesman went on: \"A really compassionate approach to politics, which he advocates, would start by recognising that most migrants come here to flee poverty, human rights abuses and conflict and that migration can help make poverty history.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
