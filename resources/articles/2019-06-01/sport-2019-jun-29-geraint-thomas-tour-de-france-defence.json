But as the 33-year-old Welshman prepares to begin his defence of his yellow jersey he insists that those images were misleading \u2013 and that he can defy the sceptics by bouncing back to retain his title. Thomas, who will be Team Ineos\u2019s joint leader alongside Egan Bernal when the Tour de France begins in Brussels on Saturday, admits the crash stopped him riding for three days. But he says he remained sitting on the ground afterwards out of frustration rather than anything more serious. \u201cWhen I saw blood dripping from my face I knew the doc wasn\u2019t going to let me continue, so I just stayed sat on the floor,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut it was more from just the anger and the disappointment, really. Just sitting there never looks great, because if a guy doesn\u2019t get up straight away it normally means something bad has happened, but I was fine.\u201d He adds: \u201cIt was disappointing to have to pull out but it was the right call. I hit my head pretty hard and I was cut above the eye. However, there was no real concussion symptoms in the couple of days afterwards, so I was able to start training again on the Friday after the crash and I\u2019ve had some decent rides since.\u201d Ineos will be without Chris Froome after the four-times Tour winner broke his femur in a training crash at the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9. This has left Thomas and his Colombian teammate Bernal favourites with the bookies. The 34-year-old Swiss Jakob Fuglsang, riding for Astana, and Britain\u2019s Adam Yates, of Mitchelton\u2013Scott, are rated as the next likeliest contenders for the podium. With last year\u2019s runner-up, Tom Dumoulin, also out with injury, this year\u2019s field is not the strongest on paper. Even so, many believe the yellow jersey rests uneasily on Thomas\u2019s shoulders, especially after his latest spill. But the Welshman says he remains confident. \u201cThe crash was not ideal, mainly because I wanted to see where I was and to be more certain about what everyone else was doing compared to me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut purely from a physical point of view, I don\u2019t think the crash is too much of an issue. I would have liked to have done all the race just to have a really good test. \u201cAll I can do now is worry about myself in training and crack on with that. But the stages I was in during the Tour de Suisse, I was feeling OK and getting better as it was going on. But we\u2019ll soon find out what form I am in.\u201d Being joint leader with Bernal will make for an interesting dynamic, but Thomas has played down fears there could be any tension as there was last year between him and Froome. \u201cDiscussing with the team, we believe it makes sense to go into the race with joint leaders as it gives us more options,\u201d he says. \u201cEgan and I will work hard for each other and the team over the three weeks of the race.\u201d Thomas also denies that his confidence had taken a hit from his latest crash. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that happens, really,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just get on with it and you don\u2019t think about it much going again, otherwise you do end up taking it a bit steady, drifting back, and not being able to race like you normally do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
