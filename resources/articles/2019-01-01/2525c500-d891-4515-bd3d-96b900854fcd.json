The 18-year-old winger has made six appearances under Sarri this season \u2013 four of them in the Europa League \u2013 but he is frustrated as he believes he deserves greater opportunity. Hudson-Odoi, who has 18 months to run on his contract, is the subject of a \u00a320m offer from Bayern Munich, which Chelsea are resisting, and he is of interest to other elite European clubs, including Real Madrid. Hudson-Odoi has seen a clutch of young English players make the move to Germany and he would be open to following suit. Chelsea, meanwhile, are in talks with Borussia Dortmund over the attacking midfielder Christian Pulisic, with a view to a summer transfer and this would impact on Hudson-Odoi\u2019s prospects. Sarri sounded like many of his predecessors at Chelsea when he said he understood the fans\u2019 desire to see talented youngsters such as Hudson-Odoi progress. Yet at the same time he is conflicted because winning matches is paramount. Hudson-Odoi came off at Watford on Boxing Day with a minor hamstring injury, then missed Sunday\u2019s win at Crystal Palace and now faces a fitness test before Wednesday night\u2019s home game against Southampton. Sarri was asked whether his young players were too impatient. \u201cAlso the fans sometimes, also the club sometimes,\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd so I am in the middle. I have to win [matches]. I can understand very well that a fan loves young players from the academy but in the long run I have to win matches and the fans want me to win matches \u2013 also the club, I think. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy at this level to take the young players from the academy \u2013 not only here, everywhere in Europe. Sometimes there are one, two young players at Barcelona and Real Madrid; there are zero at Juventus and Paris St-Germain. We are lucky because we have [Ethan] Ampadu, [Andreas] Christensen and Odoi. \u201cIn Europe there are few 18-year-old players with eight matches at this level. Odoi has played six or seven matches this season, so I think that he has to be lucky \u2013 not lucky, he is good. He has the potential to be a great player and now he has to improve. With the ball, he is a very good player. He has to improve in movements without the ball. He has to improve in the defensive phase.\u201d Sarri is expected to be without Olivier Giroud against Southampton after the striker injured an ankle at Palace but the manager said he would not recall Michy Batshuayi or Tammy Abraham in January from loans at Valencia and Aston Villa."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
