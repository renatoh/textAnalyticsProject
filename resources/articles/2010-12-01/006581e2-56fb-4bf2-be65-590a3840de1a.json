They are a he. Max McElligott plays piano and guitar and writes songs and sings them. But you could be forgiven for assuming it's a band, because it looks like one (three other musicians join him for the actual playing of the songs, including the former drummer of the Rakes) and it sounds like one. What kind of one does it sound like? Heavy, with a name like that, doubtless. Nope. It's shiny, tuneful, arena-ready pop-rock. Think the bassline being the rootnote of the chord, choruses that reach out to Row 329. That's what half the songs sound like. What about the other half? Well, they're trying to be more interesting. A bit quirkier and lighter of touch. And are they? Put it this way: when people want to listen to Duran Duran they prefer Rio and Hungry Like the Wolf to The Chauffeur, don't they? McElligott has a real gift for the big anthem \u2013 as shown by current single Lions in Cages and its predecessor The King and All of His Men \u2013 and the full-throttle stuff overshadows the artier stuff. That got him noticed by Atlantic, but one suspects the label is putting its money behind the songs that gets hands waving at gigs. If Take That are looking for a slightly hip support act for their tour, they need look no further. Where can I hear him? Lions in Cages is out now on Atlantic. There are seven tracks plus assorted videos at myspace.com/thisiswolfgang."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
