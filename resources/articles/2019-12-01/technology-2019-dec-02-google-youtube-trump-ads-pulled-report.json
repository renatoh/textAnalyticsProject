A review of the tech companies\u2019 advertising archive found at least 300 Trump ads had been pulled from the platforms, mainly over the summer, after they had been found to violate advertising policies. In an interview with 60 Minutes, YouTube chief executive officer Susan Wojcicki confirmed that there were \u201cads of President Trump that were not approved to run on Google or YouTube\u201d. Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter have faced scrutiny over political ads. In October Twitter announced it was banning political advertising on its platform. Wojcicki was also asked about a Trump ad that falsely accuses former vice-president and Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden of offering military aid to Ukraine in exchange for the firing of a prosecutor investigating a company tied to his son, Hunter. Biden\u2019s campaign asked Facebook to remove the ad earlier this year. Facebook denied the request, arguing its decision was \u201cgrounded in Facebook\u2019s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process\u201d. Wojcicki told 60 Minutes the ad also appeared on YouTube and was not in violation of the company\u2019s policies. \u201cCan a politician lie on YouTube?\u201d 60 Minutes presenter Leslie Stahl asked. \u201cFor every single video, I think it\u2019s really important to look at it,\u201d Wojcicki said. \u201cPoliticians are always accusing their opponents of lying. \u201cThat said, it\u2019s not OK to have technically manipulated content that would be misleading.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
