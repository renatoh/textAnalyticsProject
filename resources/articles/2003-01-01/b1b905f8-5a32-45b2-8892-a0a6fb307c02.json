Around me waiters are encouraging us to vacate the tables for lunch. I try to write. Tonight will be the last night of Complicite's European tour of our play Mnemonic. The first evening keeps coming back to me. It was in Zenica, a Bosnian steel town in the narrow valley north-east of Sarajevo, as part of the annual theatre festival. Zenica. Where the first refugees arrived from Srebrenica. I fumble across the stage in the darkness. Shadowy figures cram into every open space. I can just make out they are standing shoulder to shoulder. The steps are packed three or four across. The audience listens to my voice, which has been pre-recorded, but which they imagine to be live. I have just asked them the question: \"Where were you 10 years ago? Can you remember?\" Out of the darkness there is a hoarse shout. \"In a cellar with my fucking family!\" As the packed audience laugh and murmur, I put out a hand to find my chair. I can see nothing on stage at all. I break into a cold sweat. In London, when I ask the same question, few remember. Here, memories of 10 years ago are all too clear. Mnemonic is a play about memory. It opens with me asking the audience to remember but, as I sit in the darkness in Zenica waiting for the lights to come up, I am remembering, too. Remembering that the last time I played Mnemonic was with my friend Katrin Cartlidge, who died last September; remembering that she was here in the summer at the film festival; remembering the last time I was in Sarajevo was just after the war. Remembering, too, that the constant power surges in this part of the world might plunge us into darkness at any point in the show. Will we get through the performance? Should we even have revived it? A waiter brings me a coffee. I feel slightly sick. Eighteen months ago, I was sitting in the same cafe with Katrin. My mind jumps to Thessaloniki: the second date of our tour, the national theatre of northern Greece. In Thessaloniki, lunch began at 2pm and ended at 5.30pm. Bang went our technical rehearsal. Then there was the small matter of the management omitting to pay their technical crew. As charming as we are, there is a reluctance to work for free. One member of our cast is sick. The theatre is huge. Kostas Philippoglou, who plays a Greek taxi driver, is still unsure minutes before we go on if he should perform in Greek or English. Everything feels as chaotic and surprising as the city itself. Vast Byzantine ruins erupt out of the ground, Roman walls slice through the city, the orthodox chapel of St George was originally a Roman temple, then a church, then a mosque, before its final incarnation. Thessaloniki had the largest Jewish population in Greece until they were shipped north in their tens of thousands 60 years ago, never to return, their absence still palpable. Standing on the hill overlooking the town, the memory is encoded in the architecture itself. Past is still present here. Which is why we need not have worried if the show would work. From there to Munich, where the theatre is the exact opposite: intimate and technically sophisticated, with four auditoriums, each one almost always full. Then Warsaw, where we play inside Stalin's gift to the city, the People's Palace of Culture, a piece of fascist architecture that continues to dominate the skyline like a vast, sinister wedding cake. Backstage is like a time-warp. There is a pervading smell of urine and potato dumplings, and men in brown suits slide across endless corridors trailing pungent tobacco smoke. In absurd contrast, we stay at the Holiday Inn, which could be anywhere. In fact, it marks the southern-most edge of where the ghetto used to be. I walk the edge of the ghetto on our day off. There is nothing now to suggest its existence, merely a dotted line on a map. In a market, I buy a large pot of conserved mushrooms. On the opening night, Kostas Philippoglou has a moment of inspiration. He holds a watch, very old, very delicate. \"It's Russian,\" he says. Then he improvises: \"It's not delicate at all!\" There is a shout of laughter. At five the next morning we stagger home, having been taken round the clubs of Warsaw. None of the generation dancing remembers the time before the collapse of the Berlin Wall. Nor do they think much about joining Europe. \"How will it help us?\" they ask. \"Vous desirez autres choses?\" \"No thank you, I'm fine... excuse me, excusez-moi, non merci.\" This morning I found myself at the radio station France Culture, trying to explain how the bio-chemistry of the brain shows memory to be a creative act, which means there is little difference between the chemical and physical processes of memory and imagination. Now I can't even dredge up restaurant French simply because I am thinking in English. \"Nous avons un excellent menu du jour, avec un saumon en papillotte... \" Saumon... salmon. Eating roasted salmon in front of an open fire. Helsinki. It was -10C. Our costume designer Christina Cunningham, who is half-Finnish, hired a wood-fire sauna next to the sea. The freezing sea shocks us into the present. We are all exhausted and hysteria sets in as we madly dance naked in the snow. After eating, cast and crew grill me. \"So are we playing London?\" For weeks I have been trying to find a theatre to bring the new version of the show to the UK. As I look around the room in Finland, I am acutely aware of the commitment brought to bear on the project. The journey of staying with the same piece of theatre is not horizontal but vertical. The repeated action of working and playing acts like a trowel that uncovers a hidden structure under the earth. It is an action that deepens and develops. But only if you work with people who understand this: people who improvise, who modify every night. \"Yes, I hope so,\" I mutter. Desperately wishing that I was the bearer of better news. The following week in Strasbourg, I am cornered at the first-night party by a man who was born and brought up in the city. \"Tonight I remembered my whole childhood,\" he tells me. \"I was 10 when the Germans were here... The Americans wanted to bomb the town into oblivion, but the French army, encamped along the Rhine, would not let them. That's why this is the most perfectly preserved medieval town in this part of Europe. They offered us chewing gum to demolish the buildings and erect new ones.\" It is like this everywhere: outpourings of individual stories provoked by the \"memory journey\" on which we take the audience. I remember that was one of the ways in which we made the show in the first place, going on our own memory journeys. I also remember that one day we challenged ourselves to imagine the future in the same way. For example, to imagine New Year's Eve, not last year, but in 10 years' time. We asked ourselves to look around the room to see what we were doing. The replies were hilarious and eerie. I remember Katrin's forecasts were full of life and of all that was possible. And playing this show on tour, I realise that she was right. \"Come and work here,\" offers the artistic director of the theatre in Strasbourg. \"Whatever you want to do.\" That is the other thing we encounter everywhere. A desire for us to share the work. In the darkness on stage in Sarajevo, as I sat waiting to begin, remembering Katrin dispelled my momentary stage fright. I realised the murmuring voices indicated an engagement with the show. At the curtain call, when I told them that the show and tour were dedicated to Katrin, the audience stood as one. Here in Paris the cinemas are playing a tribute to her. Everywhere we go, we meet people she knew, or those she touched. And the way she touched them was to do with her sense of hope. Of possibility. When I received the telephone call in New York, to say that Katrin had died, I did not believe it. I still do not. Now I realise why. I stand in the cafe for a moment of indecision. I see her sitting at the table looking at me as the waiter is also looking at me. \"Why are you turning down the possibility of a fantastic lunch?\" her look is saying. I sit down. \"Je prendrai le menu du jour.\" And yes. We will play London. \u00b7 Mnemonic is at the Riverside Studios, London W6, from January 6.
