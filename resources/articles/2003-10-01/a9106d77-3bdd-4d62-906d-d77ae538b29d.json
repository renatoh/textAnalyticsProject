Normally athletes of Cracknell's status are not expected to race until later trials. Indeed, most of the British team, including Cracknell's pairs partner Matthew Pinsent, are currently training in Cyprus, but the Leander man is still in Britain as his wife has given birth to a baby boy. Cracknell, who finished a disappointing fourth in the World Championships pairs during August, has had plenty to focus on, not least a warning from his coach J\u00fcrgen Grobler that he should not take Olympic selection for granted. \"Last year Matt and I never really produced any personal bests in training and, for the first time, Ian Lawson beat me in the winter assessments,\" Cracknell said. \"For the last couple of weeks, while the others have been away, I have been training particularly hard. Going to the trials has given me a goal at the end of it and it gives me an opportunity to race, which is always good\". With Lawson also away in Cyprus, Cracknell should have an easier job but he faces stiff opposition from his training partner Pete Gardiner, who sculled for Britain at this year's World Championships."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
