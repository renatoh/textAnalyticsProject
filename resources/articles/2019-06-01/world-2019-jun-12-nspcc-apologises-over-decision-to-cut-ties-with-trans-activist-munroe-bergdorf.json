The child protection charity announced last week it would have \u201cno ongoing relationship\u201d with Bergdorf, 48 hours after she told her Twitter followers how proud she was to have become the first LGBT+ campaigner for its counselling service Childline. Bergdorf, a model, said she had not been contacted by the charity before it issued its statement abruptly ending their relationship with her and, in a letter seen by the Guardian, nearly 150 NSPCC employees spoke of their \u201cembarrassment and shame\u201d at their employer\u2019s decision. In a statement on Wednesday, the NSPCC\u2019s CEO, Peter Wanless, apologised for any hurt the charity had caused. \u201cI want to acknowledge first and foremost that we shouldn\u2019t have cut ties with Munroe Bergdorf in the way we did,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should have been more thoughtful and caring about how we managed our relationship with her at the outset as we were the ones who had reached out to her and brought her into the Childline family in the first place.\u201d Bergdorf responded to the statement on Twitter. \u201cI appreciate the formal apology, NSPCC,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not perfect and I can\u2019t tell you the emotional distress that this has brought to my door. But I just want to move on from this whole ordeal.\u201d Wanless said the decision to cut ties with Bergdorf \u2013 which was made by the charity\u2019s board of trustees \u2013 was nothing to do with the fact that she was transgender. He said the decision was made because of \u201cthe lack of process that our organisation used when deciding to work with Munroe\u201d and previous comments that provoked concerns around safeguarding and equality. He explained: \u201cThe board decided an ongoing relationship with Munroe was inappropriate because of her statements on the public record, which we felt would mean that she was in breach of our own risk assessments and undermine what we are here to do.\u201d Bergdorf had been been criticised for inviting children to get in touch with her directly on social media. The NSPCC had also faced criticism on social media that she was an inappropriate \u201csexualised\u201d role model for children, and accusations that she was a \u201cporn model\u201d. Bergdorf posed for Playboy in 2018, but said in a statement that she had never appeared in porn. She added that demonising those who had was unacceptable. Her supporters have highlighted that the NSPCC has previously worked with the models Melinda Messenger and Abbey Clancy. Bergdorf also told the Guardian on Tuesday that she saw nothing wrong with letting trans children message her \u201cas a friend to turn to\u201d. In his apology, Wanless said the charity had failed to speak to Bergdorf before making the announcement it were cutting ties on Friday. \u201cI have spoken with Munroe today about the situation and have offered a full, frank and unreserved apology,\u201d he said. \u201cI agreed with her that we condemn all transphobic bullying, harassment and abuse.\u201d He added that the board of trustees had commissioned an immediate review of the process by which it establishes relationships with supporters. Bergdorf has previously been fired by L\u2019Or\u00e9al after she said in the wake of racist violence in Charlottesville that white people should acknowledge that their \u201cexistence, privilege and success as a race is built on the backs, blood and death of people of colour\u201d. She stood down from the Labour party\u2019s LGBT advisory board last year after newspaper reports revealed comments from her in her early 20s describing suffragettes as \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d. The NSPCC\u2019s statement last week said Bergdorf had \u201csupported the most recent phase of Childline\u2019s campaign, which aims to support children with LGBTQ+ concerns\u201d, though she had never been a \u201cChildline ambassador\u201d. It said: \u201cShe will have no ongoing relationship with Childline or the NSPCC. The NSPCC does not support, endorse or authorise any personal statements made by any celebrities who contribute to campaigns.\u201d A letter, which was signed by 148 NSPCC staff by the time it was sent on Monday afternoon, read: \u201cWe are deeply disappointed about the treatment of Munroe by the organisation. \u201cIn particular, we are concerned at the NSPCC\u2019s decision to replicate the experience that many trans children and adults experience in being subjected to abuse and ridicule and subsequently abandoned.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
