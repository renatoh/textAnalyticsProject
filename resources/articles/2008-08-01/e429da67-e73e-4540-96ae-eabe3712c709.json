He's pursued there by his arch enemy, a Palestinian terrorist called the Phantom (John Turturro). Zohan looks and sounds like a character created by Sacha Baron Cohen and pursues the same line in social embarrassment and misogynistic sex jokes. But his aim is didactic rather than disruptive. Sadly, his attempts to bring about mutual understanding between Jews and Palestinians are crude and sentimental."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
