Answering questions from Tory members over the phone, Johnson admitted extra funding was needed to support police in order to beat the \u201cnightmare\u201d issue. \u201cBut it\u2019s also about giving police the political cover and support they need to do stop and search and to come down hard on those carrying knives,\u201d he said. The former London mayor added that he \u201cwould like to see more officers out on the street\u201d but offered no definite plans as to when or how this would be achieved. Though Theresa May reduced stop and search powers when she was home secretary in 2014, they were boosted under her premiership in an attempt to combat knife crime earlier this year. Critics of the tactic say they disproportionately target black people, and a recent analysis of Home Office data shows that they are 40 times more likely than white people to be stopped and searched. Laying out his leadership bid to those who will be able to vote for him from 6 July, Johnson also promised to cut corporation tax and to allow start-up businesses to offset capital against tax in an effort to boost their prospects. He also renewed promises to help young people by cutting interest rates on student loans and increasing overall education spending by about \u00a35bn. Johnson insisted that the delay to Brexit had \u201cfermented unrest on both sides\u201d and that after it was pushed through people would \u201cbecome much less aerated by the issue.\u201d Boasting of his diplomatic credentials, Johnson added that he had gained support both from the leave and remain camps of the Brexit argument. \u201cWe all know that we\u2019re staring down the barrels of extinction unless we get this done,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a modern Conservative, I will deliver for the whole country.\u201d Earlier on Monday, Johnson was heckled during a visit to a Sevenoaks garden centre while on the campaign trail in Kent with his remain-supporting brother Jo Johnson, who is the Conservative MP for Orpington. A passerby told the favourite to win the leadership race, \u201cit\u2019s a shame your brother\u2019s not running\u201d and added \u201cgood luck with your preposterous ideas\u201d. A man also branded him \u201ccrazy\u201d as Johnson walked past shoppers. Johnson has sought to portray himself throughout the campaign as tougher on Brexit than his rival Jeremy Hunt, insisting he will take Britain out of the EU on 31 October, \u201cdo or die\u201d. On Monday, Hunt claimed that the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, had told him she was willing to look at a new Brexit deal package put forward by a new prime minister. \u201cProviding we\u2019re sensible, and I think the approach that I\u2019ve laid out is a sensible approach and a fair approach, and I think that it\u2019s in Germany\u2019s interests as well,\u201d he told Sky News in an interview. \u201cWhat she has said is she will look at the package and I think she will look at it with an open mind.\u201d He also told Kay Burley he felt \u201cdeeply uncomfortable\u201d that his \u201cposh school\u201d education meant his life chances may be better than someone else who did not receive the same schooling. \u201cI went to a posh school, I had a fantastic education, and I was very lucky,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cAnd I also felt deeply uncomfortable that because I was lucky enough to go to that school I might have better life chances than someone with equal talents, equal ambition, equal energy, who didn\u2019t have the chance to get such a great education. \u201cI am incredibly proud of the education reforms that have been championed by Michael Gove under this Conservative government that have improved the quality of state schools so that a number of them are as good as Charterhouse, the school I went to.\u201d He added: \u201cI think that\u2019s a fantastic reform, but I still think we have a national blind spot, and that\u2019s why I said I want education to be our social mission.\u201d The pair are currently taking part in a series of hustings around the country ahead of the vote of Tory members. The result will be announced on 23 July, and the new prime minister will take office the next day after May has finished her last prime minister\u2019s questions. She will then head to Buckingham Palace to hand in her resignation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
