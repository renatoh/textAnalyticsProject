Overstretched resources in the field mean that the public are being left unprotected, according to the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), which launches a report on Monday as sexual health experts warn that services are at \u201ctipping point\u201d due to budget cuts. It found that the number of 18- to 24-year-olds being tested for chlamydia, the most common disease, has fallen by close to half a million in the five years since the government moved public health services into local authorities. Despite a 25% fall in tests, recent figures recorded a higher level of positive diagnoses, now at 128,000 cases a year. The past five years coincided with what the RCN described as detrimental changes to commissioning of services, funding reductions and a \u201cdangerous\u201d recruitment freeze. An RCN survey of more than 600 nurses working in sexual health found services severely understaffed, with few registered nurses, a mix of skills that the body described as inadequate and little access to training. Nurses reported having to turn patients away, a lack of clinics, low morale and a \u201ctick box\u201d culture. Six in 10 said there had been a reduction in the number of registered nurses where they work, with the majority pointing to recruitment freezes as the reason behind shortages. The report also found that while the introduction of the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine for teenage girls had contributed to a 74% reduction in genital warts in 15- to 17-year-old girls, access to cervical screening for HPV has been affected by confusion in commissioning and provision. The impact of sexually transmitted infections remains greatest in heterosexuals aged 15 to 24, black ethnic minorities and gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM). Helen Donovan, professional lead for public health at the RCN, said: \u201cThis is a worrying picture of understaffed services going to extreme lengths to try to cope, even turning people away \u2013 the last thing a health professional ever wants to do. \u201cIf people are not able to access services then serious STIs could go undiagnosed and untreated \u2013 it is a major risk to public health.\u201d Olwen Williams, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, said that the findings provided more evidence that sexual health services had reached tipping point: \u201cWith the recent emergence of multidrug-resistant gonorrhoea and record levels of syphilis, these cuts have come at the worst possible time.\u201d The Department of Health said: \u201cThis government has a strong track record on public health\u2014teenage pregnancies are at an all-time low and sexually transmitted infections continue to fall overall. Local areas are best placed to understand their own needs, so over the current spending period, we will invest more than \u00a316bn to help them deliver the right services for their communities.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
