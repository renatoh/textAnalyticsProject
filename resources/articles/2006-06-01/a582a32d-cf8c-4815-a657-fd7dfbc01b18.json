The latest trendy tag, user-generated content (UGC), has captured the hotly-contested crown for most horrible and confusing name. Undoubtedly, something significant is happening to content at the boundaries where personal meets public, amateur meets professional, but there's a lot of sloppy thinking about user-generated content. Many different activities are being clustered under the horrid acronym UGC; personal communication by sending emails is at the base of the pyramid. Sharing photos, playlists and videos via things like Flickr and YouTube is included, along with personal publishing on blogs and social networking sites. Somewhere in there are the deliberately editorialised \"participation\" projects set up by big media - like my own FourDocs for Channel 4 - and every kind of hybrid project in between. But it's not as simple as it looks; and one of the key factors is the motivation of the \"user\". Why do people generate content anyway? But before we get to that, the very term user-generated content is loaded with implicit assumptions. When, for instance, did the word \"user\" last have a positive meaning? It's all warm spoons and Irvine Welsh characters nicking purses. Couple it with \"generated\", a dehumanising word which undermines creativity, and you've put these pesky users firmly in their place. Power is \"generated\", art isn't. Top it off with a dash of \"content\", a sloppy generalisation at the best of times, and you've put this stuff firmly in a box marked alien and poor-quality. So, if you're thinking about user-generated content, I encourage you to delve a little deeper. I had the opportunity to do this recently in the unlikely setting of a cruise liner in the Norwegian fjords (don't ask). There was no technology involved but I found the activities of the community aboard to be full of parallels which point to the deeper roots of the user-generated content phenomenon. The sheer range and quantity of communication which went on amongst the large group of people trapped/cruising together was illuminating for a start. The grey-haired and sensibly-shod folks, armed with their state-of-the-art digital cameras to a man (and I use the term deliberately), were doing a lot of communicating and, hence, generating a lot of content. At dinner, people talked in pairs or small groups. Most of what they said was trivial - at our table we talked a lot about the food and the weather. Almost none of what we said would have merited much attention from a passer-by, a bit like most email. But there was a bloke behind us loudly opining to some Americans. He seemed to believe he had a mission to share his views not just with them but with most of the restaurant. Sometimes he was quite interesting. For much of the rest of the evening it would have been better if he'd kept his voice down. I expect he has a blog. At the other extreme, every night at 10.30pm there was a show. Now that's what you call content. Not \"generated\" by \"users\", but rather shared by professional people with special skills at telling jokes, changing with dizzying rapidity between skimpy, sparkling costumes and singing songs by Nat King Cole. The comedian even incorporated content about the users sitting near the stage in his act. At the end of each show, a nice man called Warren came on and gave us vital information such as when we could have our breakfast tomorrow. He was like a BBC newsreader with the remit to educate 1,700 passengers. But with more sequins. When Warren was done, we filed out. The buzz of polite conversation filled the air. There we were again, recklessly creating user-generated content as we chatted about how wonderful the costumes were, sharing this content about content with each other on the way to the bar. And in the bar, there's was some truly hardcore UGC - karaoke. Thank you to Lydia from Surrey for her un-ironic rendering of You're So Vain by Carly Simon. Was all of this user-generated content? Yes, in a way it was, but I defy even the most technophile reader to argue that it's all the same. It's true that social search, recommendation systems and folksonomies are adding huge scale to the communication we're used to in the physical world. But seeing user-generated content as a single thing which sets out to attack traditional media is lazy. Real communities are nothing like as simple as that - as I was reminded after a week surfing the waves not the web. \u00b7 Anthony Lilley is chief executive of Magic Lantern Productions"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
