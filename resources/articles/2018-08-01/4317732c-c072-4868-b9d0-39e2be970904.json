At a state dinner for evangelical Christian ministers on Monday night at the White House, Trump urged religious leaders to use the power of their pulpits to make sure that \u201call of your people vote\u201d in November, the New York Times reported. \u201cYou\u2019re one election away from losing everything you\u2019ve got,\u201d Trump reportedly told them. If Republicans lose Congress, \u201cthey will end everything immediately\u201d, the president said, seemingly referring to congressional Democrats. He went on: \u201cThey will overturn everything that we\u2019ve done and they\u2019ll do it quickly and violently. And violently. There\u2019s violence. When you look at antifa, and you look at some of these groups, these are violent people.\u201d The Times reported that these additional remarks did not make clear \u201cwhom he was talking about\u201d. A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request to clarify whether the president was referring to congressional Democrats as \u201cviolent people\u201d, or to comment on what connection the president was alleging between establishment Democratic lawmakers and young anti-fascist protesters. Trump\u2019s comments appear to echo the rhetoric of political advertisements from the rightwing National Rifle Association. In a much-criticized video advertisement last year, the gun rights group used footage from street protests to paint the entire American left, and all Americans who oppose Trump, as violent thugs who \u201cbully and terrorize the law-abiding\u201d. The ad\u2019s incendiary rhetoric was sharply criticized, with one critic calling it \u201ca whisper shy of a call for full civil war\u201d. Over the past two years, as emboldened neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups have staged public rallies and marches across the United States, black-clad anti-fascist protesters, or \u201cantifa\u201d, have shown up to demonstrate against them. Anti-fascist protesters argue that the best way to prevent American neo-Nazis from growing more powerful is to make them afraid to meet or demonstrate in public. Many of the rightwing groups that \u201cantifa\u201d demonstrators show up to protest are self-described fascists. But the tactics of direct street protest and physical confrontation remain controversial among many Americans, Democrats and Republicans alike. The protest behavior of \u201cantifa\u201d has become a favorite topic for Republicans looking to deflect attention from the activities of violent white supremacist extremists who greeted Trump\u2019s presidency as a victory, and who advocate publicly for a whites-only nation. During the violent neo-Nazi rallies in Charlottesville, Virginia, last August, white supremacists attacked black residents and protesting local ministers, and clashed with anti-fascist protesters in the streets. Afterwards, Trump repeatedly condemned \u201cboth sides\u201d for the violence. Local Charlottesville residents who had showed up to protest the white supremacists, and found themselves as the targets of violence while police officers stood by, had a different opinion. \u201cAntifa saved my life twice on Saturday,\u201d the Rev Seth Wispelway, a local minister from Charlottesville, told Slate in the wake of last August\u2019s violence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
