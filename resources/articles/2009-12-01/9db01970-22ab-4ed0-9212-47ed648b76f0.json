The Spain midfielder made his first appearance since damaging the muscle in the draw at Burnley in mid-December when he was summoned from the bench against Aston Villa on Sunday. That 27-minute cameo yielded two decisive goals before he retreated feeling discomfort in the limb once again. Arsenal opted to give the injury a further 24 hours to settle but will scan the leg today hoping their worst fears \u2013 that F\u00e1bregas could be absent until the FA Cup fourth-round weekend on 23 January \u2013 will not be confirmed. The Spaniard will certainly miss trip to Portsmouth and Sunday's FA Cup tie at West Ham, though he may now also have to sit out the league games against Bolton Wanderers, home and away, and Everton as the Londoners seek to maintain their revitalised title challenge. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger will be without Den\u00edlson at Fratton Park as well, the Brazilian having suffered a back injury against Villa that is not thought to be as serious as the one which kept him out for more than two months earlier in the campaign. But Arsenal have been boosted by Alex Song's availability after Cameroon confirmed they do not expect the midfielder to report for international duty at the African Cup of Nations until next Monday, 4 January. That will allow Song to feature against Pompey and, most likely, at Upton Park on Sunday. Regardless, F\u00e1bregas's absence represents an untimely blow with his influence all too evident in an inspirational display against Villa. \"He was great and is a fantastic player,\" said Thomas Vermaelen. \"He had an injury and he did everything to make this game. We weren't creating as many chances and, when he came on, he gave us more opportunities to score. I have never seen a player come on before and have such an immediate impact. \"Cesc is really dangerous. He has a great vision on the pitch. He is the best midfield player I have played with. He is really smart. In training it is really difficult to defend against him. You'd think he has eyes in the back of his head because he sees everything. If he is injured again, we will just have to do without him.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
