Leicester City are poised to become Premier League champions. It is a beguiling prospect and one Ranieri has tried hard to play down. He was at it again after this victory, Leicester\u2019s seventh in nine matches and one that kept them five points clear of second-placed Tottenham after their win over Bournemouth on Sunday. He insisted he and his players \u201cdon\u2019t speak about the title\u201d and that their focus is solely on \u201cour performance\u201d. But this is one area in which the manager is failing; his players are openly talking about finishing on top, while the supporters are practically singing themselves hoarse in anticipation of a first top division crown in the club\u2019s history. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win the league\u201d came the chant after the final whistle on Saturday, and on it went for close to 20 minutes. They believe and, privately, Ranieri must do too. The maths is simple: if Leicester win six of their final seven fixtures they will be champions. Southampton, West Ham, Swansea and Everton at home, Sunderland, Manchester United and Chelsea away; those are the remaining tests, and although it would be foolish to predict too much in this most unpredictable of seasons, there are six victories there for a team with such great momentum. And they will not need all six should Spurs fail to win all of their remaining matches. As Ranieri said: \u201cEverything is in our hands.\u201d There are many fascinating strands to Leicester\u2019s title surge but what particularly stands out during these finals stages is how they have shifted from being a team who scored and conceded in practically every match to one that are doing just enough of the former and none of the latter on a regular basis. Saturday was the fourth time in their past five matches that the leaders had triumphed 1-0, a contrast to their results from the opening day to the end of September, which included 4-2 and 3-2 wins, a 2-2 draw and a 5-2 defeat. Leicester\u2019s first 1-0 win of the season came against Crystal Palace on 24 October. The change in emphasis is partly down to teams defending deeper against Leicester, having seen how Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez in particular can hurt the opposition given the time and space to do so. There has also been an obvious refinement by Ranieri to their counterattacking approach, which has seen their defensive shape become near impenetrable. That was again the case here as their back four kept a tight and disciplined line while those in front of them worked tirelessly to retreat and press whenever Palace were in possession. Alan Pardew was certainly impressed with that he saw, Palace\u2019s manager describing Leicester as \u201cunderestimated defensively\u201d, and from inside the victors\u2019 dressing room came clear evidence that they are taking great pride in their solidity. \u201cWe love defending. We love clean sheets,\u201d said Danny Simpson, the right-back. \u201cFinal whistle blows, we come together and praise each other, another clean sheet. We don\u2019t mind booting it into row Z. We don\u2019t mess about. We will put it out for a throw-in and everyone regroups. We make it as difficult as we can for the opposition.\u201d Palace simply could not find a way through, even during a second half in which they peppered the visitors\u2019 area with crosses and shots, most notably from the substitute Bakary Sako. Leicester\u2019s centre-backs, Wes Morgan and Robert Huth, were particularly outstanding, with the former winning 92% of his personal duels. As often this season, the captain led by example. Going forward, Leicester yet again performed with great speed and accuracy, as seen in the buildup to their winner. Mahrez got it after converting Vardy\u2019s cross from close range and he has now been involved in more Premier League goals than any other player this season (16 goals and 11 assists). The Algerian remains the standout performer for the division\u2019s standout team. For Palace, it is 13 league games without victory and the lack of confidence and creativity they displayed suggests that run could continue for some time. The visit of Norwich on 9 April takes on huge importance for a club with one eye on a FA Cup semi-final given there are only five points between the teams, who are in 16th and 17th respectively. \u201cWe need a win, or two wins, before the semi-final,\u201d said Pardew. \u201cIf we got those I\u2019d be happy.\u201d Man of the match Wes Morgan (Leicester City)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
