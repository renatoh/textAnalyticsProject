At Guildford, where a session\u2019s play was possible, Yorkshire made quick work of Surrey\u2019s first innings, taking the remaining two wickets in 22 minutes, shortly after Surrey had collected their third batting point. Yorkshire then had to face Morne Morkel, tip-toeing in from the pavilion end in the rain-coated gloom, his beanstalk arm extending seeming endlessly into the sky. But it was Rikki Clarke who made the breakthrough \u2013 Adam Lyth brilliantly caught in the gully by Will Jacks. Bad light took the players off just before lunch with Yorkshire 58 for one, and even the die-hards, knees covered only by a large umbrella, called it a day at three o\u2019clock. Liam Livingstone led the charge at New Road, where Lancashire were in a hurry after missing nearly two day\u2019s play. He walloped eight fours and a six in his 53 not out, after Worcestershire\u2019s Wayne Parnell caused a wobble with two wickets in two balls in his first over. Lancashire were 110 for three, a lead of 12, when the rain came again. There was time for eleven overs at Grace Road, where the first two days had been washed out, thanks to much mopping and squeezing from the groundstaff. With a damp outfield hampering the Middlesex bowlers, Leicestershire had time to lose three wickets. Paul Horton, having waited two and a half days for a bat, was run out for 0. Will Beer fell a cheese slice short of what would have been his first Championship century at Arundel, bowled by an inswinger from Gloucestershire\u2019s David Payne on 97. Beer, playing his 18th first-class match in 12 years with Sussex, had been batting for seven hours and 41 minutes, and the crowd\u2019s sigh could have calmed a riot. Ben Brown, the Sussex captain, was full of praise: \u201cThe wickets at Arundel can be slow and you can get bowled out for 150 trying to force the pace so the way he played, which allowed the rest of us to bat around him, was an exceptional effort and it\u2019s a shame he didn\u2019t get the hundred he deserved.\u201d There was almost a full day\u2019s play at Swansea where Graham Wagg (100) and Lucas Carey (62 not out) put on a quickfire 167 for the ninth wicket, breaking a 90 year old record, and carrying Glamorgan to four batting points. Derbyshire\u2019s Billy Godleman (86) and Tom Lace (78) then compiled an unbroken 147 for the third wicket. The match at Welbeck between Nottinghamshire and Hampshire was abandoned, with only one day\u2019s play possible. Hampshire take eight points, Notts five, remaining bottom of Division One. There was no play at Chester-le-Street, or at Canterbury where the game is thrillingly poised. had time to lose three wickets. Hope you\u2019re all home and dry. Another truncated day round the counties, with no results looking possible save possibly at Canterbury if the rain stays away in the morning. Congratulations to Will Beer for his so-near-so-far 97 at Arundel, and to Graham Wagg (100) and Lucas Carey, whose record-breaking ninth wicket stand I somehow missed this morning. Many thanks for the messages, thanks for popping by during the rain, and see you all tomorrow for more wellies and wickets. Good night! Ok, I\u2019m going to write up for a bit - the only game still in play is at Swansea where Derbyshire are 141 for 2, 253 behind Glamorgan. Remember, this is only day two in this confusingly fractured round. Abhijato Sensarma has sent us Virat Kohli\u2019s latest youtube sensation, in which he raps about and wears a sock on his hand. And at Taunton, Pakistan are nearly down and out, but not quite. Keep half an eye on them here, Sarfaraz may have other ideas. Arrive back very soggy to the delicious smell of french onion tart - all is right with the world. In the meantime games have started, and finished, with only one still going - the ever reliable Swansea. Grace Road and New Road suspended for bad light, and they\u2019ve called it a day at Arundel. So to Swansea, where Lace and Godleman have put on 43 to take Derbyshire to 117 for two. I\u2019m going to abandon ship here at Guildford before the puddles creep inside the tent and the wifi has turned off. I\u2019ll be back in half an hour or so - there are four games to keep an eye on, all Division Two. At tea, Leicester are 27 for two, and Sussex are 351 for 8. Not at tea, Derby 74 for one, and Lancashire cracking on at New Road, 87 for three. Livingstone five fours and a six in his 34, with dreams of flash-bang runs and a declaration? I\u2019ll leave that with you. Tim Robinson is standing under the staircase looking at the rain. I think you can safely call it off Tim...he has! Play abandoned here for the day at Guildford. Strange ICC story here. And Somerset have a new chairman Murtagh, Murtaghs. Sam Evans gone for 1. Leicestershire 19 for two. Is this what they call a no-win situation for the batsmen? Lancashire on the attack. Liam Livingstone. Bang. And at Grace Road,after a two and a half day wait, Paul Horton is run out for 0. Pakistan 56 for two after ten. They\u2019re pegging up a front to the tent now, raindrops replaced by raindrops, the very last spectator has left the ground, but still they haven\u2019t called it off. This is slightly disconcerting, as the rain continues to fall outside the tent at Guildford, but there is play round the grounds. Three grounds in fact. Leicestershire 6 for 0 as play eventually starts on the third day at three o\u2019clock. Lancashire 44 for three at New Road. Glamorgan all out 394. Derbyshire 17 for o. And they\u2019ve called it off for the day at Canterbury. Inspection at 3.30 at Arundel, play due to start at 3.10 at Grace Road. And oh dear, Lancashire are 32 for 3 at New Road. Two in two for Wayne Parnell: Davies for 24, and Jones for a duck. Hass still there, 0 not out. Scott Borthwick very agreeably had a chat in the press tent. He\u2019s still hopeful that Surrey can retain their Championship. \u201cWe have to be confident, it is so tight at the top. Only Somerset are clear, winning four out of five though it looks like they\u2019ll get draw at Canterbury. With out squad we still have to believe. Two wins and suddenly you\u2019re up to third and putting pressure on the leaders. \u201cWe\u2019re not far off. You go back and it\u2019s just a couple of key parts of games that have gone wrong - at Beckenham we got a wicket off a no ball, and then against Somerset we dropped a couple of catches early on and were bowling really well. On day four we had a good chance but ...\u201d \u201cDuring the one-day cup we had ten players unavailable at one time. It\u2019s ridiculous - not many counties would be able to cope with so many injuries. And they\u2019ve been daft ones too. I got a side injury trying to slog one against the students, I never even knew I had a muscle in my side! The week off has come at a good time. The big lads have had to put a shift in, they\u2019ll be wanting a rest.\u201d Lancashire are having a bat at New Road, all looks smooth: 14 for 0. Hoping to find someone from Surrey to talk to while it rains. We\u2019ve just done a count and realised that 12 players from their senior squad are unavailable either through injury or international commitments. It\u2019s quite some hit. We\u2019ve resorted to talking star signs in press tent (pisces in case you\u2019re wondering). It is raining really quite hard and a handful of supporters sit loyally by. They\u2019re playing only at Swansea, where Glamorgan are 282 for eight. Moeen Ali has become a father for the second time, and at 302 for eight, Australia have had a collapse of sorts. And the rain starts to fall at Guildford. Covers on, exercising players off. The sigh of folding seats flipping up and hats being tugged down as the long trudge home begins. Welbeck (day 3): Nottinghamshire 162 (Abbott 6-37; Mullaney 45) v Hampshire 93-2. MATCH ABANDONED Canterbury: Kent 139 (Gregory 6-32, Brooks 2-22) and 24-2 v Somerset 169 (Banton 63; Podmore 3-37, Stewart 3-37, Milnes 3-39). NO PLAY YET TODAY. Guildford: Surrey 313 (Stoneman 61, Foakes 62; Patterson 5-81) v Yorkshire 58-1. Division Two Chester-le-Street: Durham 253 (Sanderson 4-55; Raine 82 , Carse 77 not out) v Northamptonshire 254-6 (Vasconcelos 105 not out; Carse 3-62 ; Rushworth 3-45). NO PLAY TODAY. Leicester: Leicestershire v Middlesex INSPECTION 130PM Worcester: Worcestershire 98 all out (Onions 4-55, Anderson 4-24, Mahmood 2-8; Barnard 32) v Lancashire. START DELAYED BY RAIN Day 2 Swansea: Glamorgan 282-8 (Reece 3-40, Palladino 3-64) v Derbyshire Arundel: Sussex 351-8 (Beer 97; Payne 3-71) v Gloucestershire It\u2019s raining heavily at Canterbury and prospects of play are not good, which is a right shame. Still, a day might be enough for a result. And Morkel plus gloom means it\u2019s bad light here at Guildford, where I assume we\u2019ll now take lunch. Yorkshire 58 for one. Lunch scores and prospects of play round the counties to follow. Runs galore in the World Cup game, Australia winding up for some carnage - 218 for two with 17 overs left... keep an eye on it with Jonathan Howcroft . David Warner 90 not out. Here at Guildford, Morkel has the ball again at the pavilion end, perhaps he needs some Ballance in his life. GB is, though, the leading run scorer in Division One - this should be intriguing. Clark and Clarke bowling in tandem at Guildford. Two consecutive first innings stands of 50 plus between Fraine and Lyth, with Lyth looking in neat touch. Yorks 51 for 0. And er, no, hang on, Lyth is caught one-handedly at gully by Will Jacks off Clarke Rikki. Yorks 51 for one. Will Beer, we salute you, here\u2019s the long walk back. Play has been abandoned for the day at Chester le Street. And two wickets fall in two overs at Arundel, including Will Beer for 97. Poor Will. Sussex 335 for seven. Jordan Clark is a different shape to Morkel, squarer with a more solid run-up and an action more dominated by his bowling arm, if that makes sense. He looks quick, though where he\u2019d have fitted in Lancashire\u2019s current bowling line-up had he stayed at Old Trafford, I\u2019m not sure. He might have found himself part of the rotation policy, though presumably more rotated than at Surrey. This is his first Championship game of the summer. The gloom has lifted a bit, and Yorkshire are fighting hard. While things are quiet, can I do a little plug for Rob Smyth\u2019s book on Robin Smith coming out tomorrow? I haven\u2019t read it, but knowing Rob and his writing plus his empathy, I expect it to be fantastic. So Yorkshire survive Morkel, who is replaced by Jordan Clark. Yorkies 28-0. And Glamorgan have suffered a slight malfunction - 222 for eight. As Morkel tip-toes in, body slowly extending to its full six foot five - maybe eight foot from the top of his right hand - as he accelerates in to the crease in the rain-coated gloom, I wonder which fast bowler you\u2019d least like to face. Mark Baldwin of The Times remembers watching Mike Procter bowling to Roger Malone, the sports presenter on HTV West, with Malone miked up and dressed in a suit of armour at Bristol, and Procter running in off the sightscreen. We can\u2019t find the coverage, but here is Procter at his pomp. A drop! Stoneman at mid-off seems to get his timing wrong. Yorkshire 12 for 0. It\u2019s dark here, gloom getting comfortable. And a third for Palladino at Swansea. Owen Morgan for 33. Wonder if he ever gets misdirected mail. Glamorgan 206 for six. Injury update: Yorkshire\u2019s Duanne Olivier won\u2019t bowl for the remainder of this game because of pain in his hips. He\u2019ll have a scan on return to Leeds. For those asking BTL, here is the link to Morne steaming in from the pavilion end. Will Fraine just left one, not sure that\u2019s going to end well. Things pottering along swimmingly at Swansea (189-5) and Arundel (286-5), Beer just 19 runs away from a century. Jordan Clark looking good with the bat and speedy between the wickets. A small complaint. Yorkshire\u2019s players have numbers on their jumpers, Lancashire\u2019s don\u2019t. For spectators unfamiliar with the players, or even those who are familiar with them but struggle to distinguish between two six footish, strapping buff figures from 30 yards, it would be a simple thing to make the game more accessible. And while my computer coughs, Clark is out for 26. Surrey 313, Patterson 5-81. And Morne Morkel is warming up with an ominous air. My esteemed colleague has suggested that Jordan Thompson has the look of a young Fred Trueman, facially. Here is Jordan, for your contemplation who, incidentally, is a type one diabetic. An early wicket here at Guildford. Morne Morkel caught in the first over at second slip. Surrey 291 for nine. It\u2019s fine at Guildford, we\u2019ve even had patches of sunshine and I can see shirt sleeves, so play will start on time. As it will at the World Cup game at Taunton, and as it will at Swansea and Arundel. They\u2019ve called it quits at Welbeck, with the teams shaking hands on a draw. But, excitingly, Rishabh Pant is going to fly in as India\u2019s World Cup replacement for Shikhar Dhawan. Good morning from leafy Surrey, home of both the Diggers and Dominic Raab. The weather is a bit blah, with showers due from the east mid-afternoon, which is a shame as the game is nicely poised after Steve Patterson\u2019s golden arm struck thrice in an over towards the end of the day. All eyes immediately to Canterbury where 22 wickets fell in the day: the skies are overcast, the covers are on but play is expected to start on time. It rained all night, it rains all day at Chester le Street, there will be no play before lunch at Grace Road, there is a pitch inspection at 10.30 at New Road, no news from Welbeck or Swansea as yet (don\u2019t hold your breath) and at the moment it is clear at Arundel. And some good news at last for the World Cup: it may be grey and chilly in Taunton, but play is expected to start on time for the Australia v Pakistan match.
