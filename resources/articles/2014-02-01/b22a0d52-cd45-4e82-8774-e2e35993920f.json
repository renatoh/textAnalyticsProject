At least since 1945, the policies that have shaped Britain's farming and welfare have had at their heart the idea that food should be affordable and the benefits safety net big enough for all. That is not to say there will never be the occasional crisis, but on the whole food security has been a question of land use, climate change and global population growth. That's why the biggest organiser of food banks in the UK, the Trussell Trust, was originally set up not to help in the UK, but in Bulgaria. It's 15 years since they realised that there was a problem closer to home. Since 2011 it has escalated sharply. Between April and September last year, the trust provided 355,000 food parcels, more than in the whole of the previous year. The total, taking into account many other less national or well-organised providers of food aid, could be nearer 500,000, according to the church leaders who wrote an open letter to David Cameron on Thursday. Even more shocking, over 5,000 people have been treated for malnutrition in the past year. The letter from the bishops and faith leaders echoed closely the criticisms earlier in the week of the archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Vincent Nichols. This was not a political point-scoring exercise. They weren't arguing against the government's benefits reforms. They acknowledge that many of the food bank clients' problems were related to the recession \u2013 debt, sharply rising food prices and heating costs and stagnant wages. But there was also the compound impact of many small cuts in state support, from the bedroom tax to family tax credit. And many of the cases \u2013 48% on Trussell Trust figures \u2013 can be traced to delays and sanctions in the benefits system. This is something the government can take action on. But first, ministers would have to overcome their absolute refusal to acknowledge the problem. The denial is becoming absurd. Take the fate of a Warwick University report into household food security that was finally published on Thursday, nearly a year after it was commissioned. The report was completed within weeks \u2013 it was a rapid evidence assessment report, a kind of literature review \u2013 but what the commissioning department, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, called the \"quality assurance process\", has taken an astonishing 10 months to complete. Yet its conclusions were, like the evidence on which they were based, patchy. Most contentiously, the researchers rebutted the opinion of some ministers that it is the expanding number of food banks that is driving up the demand for food parcels. They found the reverse: food banks are in fact following demand as more and more people have nowhere else to turn. They also point out that emergency food is no solution to a long-term problem about which far too little is understood. These are hardly scandalous conclusions, except to a government in denial. Organisations that manage food banks say that the way benefit delays and harsh sanctions are imposed varies across the country. Clearer guidelines and closer monitoring could mean thousands fewer desperate households. So could a bit of attention to detail for which hard-pressed Jobcentre Plus staff often do not have the time. The Royal National Institute of Blind People has 50 potential legal actions against the Department for Work and Pensions on behalf of blind and partially sighted people who have had their benefits stopped for failing to respond to letters they couldn't read. This is not an argument about whether or not welfare reform is necessary, nor how far it should go, nor even how fast. On the one hand, it is a question of poor administration that is pitching some families into crisis. Scaled up to the levels it has now reached, where in one of the world's richest countries half a million people need food aid, the church leaders have got it right. It is a national crisis, and it is a disgrace."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
