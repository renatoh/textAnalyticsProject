The 27-year-old St Louis native was raised just 20 minutes from Ferguson, a city which has endured the gaze of the world following the shooting of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson in August. Alexander himself had a typically tough upbringing \u2013 \u201cI was raised in the ghetto. I saw things kids shouldn\u2019t see\u201d \u2013 yet when he walks out here on Saturday night to face Amir Khan in their WBC welterweight title fight, the anger, hurt and devastation which has sparked violent outrage among his friends and family will only serve to fire up his bid to shock the Briton. When he looks to where his entourage will be sat at the MGM Grand, there will be one special guest whose presence will resonate like no other. Michael Brown Sr, whose son\u2019s death has triggered such an outpouring of grief and civil unrest, will be ringside. \u201cWe\u2019re going to represent St Louis the way we always represent St Louis,\u201d said Alexander\u2019s trainer Kevin Cunningham. \u201cWe are going to have Mike Brown Sr with us, so that\u2019s pretty much what we\u2019re doing in a nutshell in reference to that.\u201d For Ferguson-raised Cunningham, though, dealing with the pain of violence and social hardships is nothing new. He first met Alexander when he was a police officer in St Louis who had started an after-school boxing programme. \u201cIt started out as trying to make a difference to these kids,\u201d he said. \u201cI first came across Devon when he was seven. He was the same happy-go-lucky, snotty-nosed kid he is now. \u201cIt\u2019s saddened me to see what has happened in Ferguson. I hope things can get better.\u201d Cunningham opened a restaurant in Ferguson last month called Knockouts. On the opening night a man tried to force his way and was stopped by bouncer Herb Burnett. Soon after, Burnett was shot in the head. A man has been charged with first-degree murder. The day after it emerged that the police officer who shot Brown would not face state criminal charges, looters tried to ransack the restaurant, which was closed out of respect for the bouncer. Cunningham sat inside with his security staff and waited. \u201cWe were there to protect our business,\u201d he said. \u201cWe figured the looters were coming, and they started burning everything down. About 10 minutes before midnight, you had 50 carloads of young guys pull up in front of the place. \u201cWe walked out with guns in hand and they stopped and one of them said: \u2018Oh, OK. We see you guys are ready.\u2019 They drove off and then went down, two doors down, and shot all over that place, a shoe store. They kicked the windows in but they couldn\u2019t get in so they drove off. I have 50 high-def TVs and a great sound system and I guess they were coming to loot us and take all the TVs.\u201d To see Alexander navigate away from a life of crime to establish himself as a world-class athlete gives Cunningham, a close friend of Khan\u2019s trainer Virgil Hunter, immense pride. \u201cHe was one of the few who stayed focused and stuck with the programme. He persevered and that\u2019s why he is where he is today. A lot of my kids fell by the wayside,\u201d he said. \u201cThe young kids look up to Devon big time because he does all the speaking in schools. He does that all the time. He\u2019s all about giving back. \u201cI got a lot of kids who I\u2019ve tried to help come up to me who messed up real bad and say: \u2018Man, I wished I had listened to you.\u2019\u201d Alexander has certainly been doing a great deal of listening of his own in the buildup to arguably the biggest fight of his life. Khan\u2019s talk about finally getting the chance to dethrone Floyd Mayweather before a punch has been thrown has angered the softly spoken southpaw. This is, after all, a fighter with some pedigree. Hailed as a boxing child prodigy, he was a phenomenal amateur, amassing a stack of triumphs before turning professional in 2004 at the age of 17. Five years later his first title arrived in the shape of the WBC light-welterweight belt in 2009 before losing it two years later to Tim Bradley. It was another three years until Alexander was crowned king once more, beating Randall Bailey to win the IBF welterweight title \u2013 only to be dethroned 14 months later. His comeback has been steady. The 27-year-old exudes confidence with no blasts of bravado and is adamant there will be only one person looking forward to potentially meeting Mayweather. \u201cIn my opinion, someone who\u2019s good doesn\u2019t have to gloat about it,\u201d he said of Khan. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to say he\u2019s good. That\u2019s cocky in my opinion. Those are the ones who fall pretty easy. I haven\u2019t been around him too much, but it\u2019s not good to be cocky. I hear about him a lot and I hear from fans over in the UK where he\u2019s from that he\u2019s arrogant. A lot of people hate him. This is the feedback I\u2019m getting and it\u2019s not good to be like that. \u201cWhat does he do that I can\u2019t do? I guess they have to say something good that he does, but I do the same things he does, so this is definitely a 50-50 fight. \u201cWhen you got talent and speed, it\u2019s hard to beat speed, but once somebody figures you out and knows how to beat you, then you\u2019ve got problems. \u201cYou don\u2019t want people to think you are arrogant. You don\u2019t want people to say you think you\u2019re better than everybody. Where I come from, we believe you\u2019re not better than anybody.\u201d As Ferguson yearns for hope, its shattered residents will look to Alexander to provide some hard-fought respite."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
