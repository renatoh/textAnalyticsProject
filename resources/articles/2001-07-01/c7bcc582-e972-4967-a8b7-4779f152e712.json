The FTSE4Good UK Fund will track one of the six new indices created by FTSE International for investors who want to target ethical companies. The FTSE4Good UK 50 index contains the largest 50 companies in the FTSE that qualify for inclusion by virtue of their record on human rights, the environment and stakeholder relations. Close Fund Management, part of the Close Brothers group, says the fund will carry an initial charge of 4% and an annual charge of 1%. Investors will be asked to make a minimum investment of \u00a31,000 or sign up for monthly investment of at least \u00a3100. To emphasise the social responsibility of the fund, Close Fund Management says up to 40% of the annual management charge will go to the United Nations Childrens Fund (Unicef). Investors can buy into the open ended investment company (Oeic) directly or they can use an Isa or Pep transfer. Despite producing figures that show the FTSE4Good index has outperformed both the FTSE 100 and the FTSE All Share over the last five years, rival fund managers remained cool about jumping on the tracker bandwagon. Emma Howard Boyd of Jupiter Asset Management, who was part of the panel of industry advisers to FTSE4Good, says the decision to produce indices of socially responsible companies is important and will raise the profile of ethical investing in the UK. But Jupiter will continue to be a \"stock picking company\" and has no plans to sell a tracker fund. \"The index is more important in terms of the profile it has brought to this whole area rather than using it to follow with a fund.\" Other investment houses which have pioneered ethical investment funds, including Henderson Global Investors, Friends Ivory &amp; Sime and Morley Management are likely to follow suit and stick to their own research rather than use FTSE indices. Marc Gordon of Close Fund Management says his fund will be useful to investors as a low cost core element in their investment portfolios that has generated strong returns \"in a way that will be positive to the community\". Six FTSE4Good indexes will go live on July 31 with two more to follow. \u0095 For more information contact www.ftse4good.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
