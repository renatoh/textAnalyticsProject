But Saracens to win the Guinness Premiership this season? Surely not. \"Yeah, yeah, we can definitely win it,\" said the Saracens director of rugby, after his mid-table team had ground out victory against a high-flying Irish side who had won their previous 10 matches in all competitions. It is a result that knocked the Exiles off the top of the table while leaving Saracens six points adrift of the play-off places. \"What we need to gain is the belief that the way we're playing the game and the talent we've got in the team is good enough to win the competition,\" said Jones. A plethora of supposed world-class players have been through Saracens' revolving doors since the game went professional in 1995, but it is more than a decade since the club won a major trophy. And Jones believes that is because the club lacked a soul. \"The only way to develop a soul is to bring players through together. And then you bring in other good people like your Van Heerdens, your Jacks, your Owens and Borthwicks, and that's your soul.\" If it is possible to build the soul of a club around one player, then Chris Jack is surely that person. He was the game's outstanding player on Saturday in a defence-dominated contest that included a touchdown for each side, but precious few try-scoring opportunities besides. Jack excelled in everything he did. You could say that he played with heart and soul, though whether he is a Premiership winner come May remains to be seen.
