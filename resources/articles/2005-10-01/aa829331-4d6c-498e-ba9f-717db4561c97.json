Police buildings, the telephone network, the airport and the security services building were among eight targets attacked by militants in a day of violence that began at 9am. Residents cowered at home as police cordoned off gun battles that intensified throughout the day. Last night, the situation settled into two standoffs. Seven militants, two of whom were wounded, barricaded themselves in at a police station, taking with them some civilian hostages. Two other militants had also taken hostages in a shop opposite the headquarters of the security services, the FSB. An FSB spokesman said the militants only had \"one or two\" hostages. \"The town is blocked off, naturally, to prevent them escaping dressed as civilians,\" he said. The attack is the most daring so far by Islamic separatist militants in Kabardino-Balkaria, a Muslim republic in the north Caucasus. It will raise fears that the militancy once confined to Chechnya has spread across the region. It comes just over a month before the Kremlin holds parliamentary elections in Chechnya in a bid to tighten its grip on the government. Yesterday, President Vladimir Putin ordered the city, which has a population of 235,000, to be sealed off and dispatched his envoy to the region, Dmitri Kozak, to Nalchik. A shoot-to-kill policy was introduced. Alexander Chekalin, first deputy interior minister, told the Russian news agency Interfax that at least 50 militants had been killed and claimed that the remaining hostage-takers would be defeated \"within the hour\". Contradictory information circulated all day, partly because the mobile and landline network had reportedly been hit in the attacks. Fyodor Shcherbakov, a spokesman for Mr Kozak, told the Guardian that 20 militants had been killed and 19 arrested. He denied reports that the militants were 300-strong. \"There were dozens of them, all from different parts of the north Caucasus,\" he said, adding they were apparently residents of the republic. He said 12 police had died and 12 civilians, but that the toll was rising. Arsen Bulatov, a local journalist, said last night that the bodies of the militants were still lying where they had died, waiting for forensic investigators. \"Everyone is at home behind closed doors,\" he added. Russia's NTV television broadcast pictures of wrecked cars. A plume of black smoke from burning buildings rose above the city centre. Despite officials insisting the fighting was over, gunfire could be heard throughout the day. A local journalist told the RIA Novosti news agency the militants had hidden their weapons under civilian clothes and mingled with crowds. The FSB spokesman said the militants had probably divided into groups. The city's police, military commissar, and a hunting shop called Arsenal were among the first targets. Russian troops held off attackers at the airport. Kavkaz.org, a Chechen militant website, said it had been emailed by Chechen separatists called the Caucasus Front who claimed responsibility for the operation alongside a local jamaat - militant Islamic council - called Yarmuk. Prosecutors said a close aide of Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev had planned the attack. Basayev claimed responsibility for last year's massacre in Beslan, 60 miles from Nalchik."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
