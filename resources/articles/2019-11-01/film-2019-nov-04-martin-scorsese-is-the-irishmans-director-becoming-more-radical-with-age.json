It would be so easy to view Martin Scorsese in a similar light. First there were his cranky-old-man comments about not considering Marvel movies to be \u201ccinema\u201d. Now comes The Irishman itself, which on superficial inspection looks like a three-and-a-half-hour wallow in the 76-year-old film-maker\u2019s comfort zone, and doesn\u2019t come close to passing the Bechdel Test. If Scorsese was on Mastermind, his specialist subject would surely be \u201cmale Italian-American criminality of the late 20th century\u201d. In theme and cast (De Niro, Pesci, Pacino, Keitel), The Irishman is of a piece with previous Scorsese works, from Mean Streets to Goodfellas to Casino \u2013 although the ages of the performers does add an elegiac note to proceedings this time. But here\u2019s the thing: Scorsese is still one of the most radical film-makers out there. He is the old dog who\u2019s constantly learning new tricks. Take The Irishman\u2019s bladder-challenging running time. You could read it as another case of auteur self-indulgence, and question whether it might have been better as a miniseries (Scorsese was an early defector to the small screen, directing HBO\u2019s Boardwalk Empire). Alternatively, you could see The Irishman as a bold experiment in stretching the conventional crime thriller into something new and interesting. In a recent interview with Sight &amp; Sound, Scorsese talks about \u201ctrying to tell stories in a different way\u201d, going less by plot than \u201cintuitive connections\u201d, in an almost improvisatory manner. He succeeds brilliantly. It is expansive and richly detailed but solidly structured, filled with scenes that become all the more riveting for their length. The movie also pushes the envelope of CGI with its \u201cyouthification\u201d technology. New tricks. No Hollywood studio would have made The Irishman. Ironically, what allowed Scorsese to pull it off was Netflix (much like his recent Bob Dylan film, Rolling Thunder Revue). Streaming services are often cast as \u201cdestroyers of cinema\u201d, but Scorsese is using them to save it. What unites his anti-Marvel comments, The Irishman\u2019s scale, and much of his career, is Scorsese\u2019s commitment to film: making it, moving it on, helping younger directors make it (recent producer credits include Joanna Hogg\u2019s The Souvenir and the Safdie Brothers\u2019 Uncut Gems), preserving and restoring it (as founder and chairman of the Film Foundation), and sharing his love of it (he has made documentaries on American and Italian cinema, with a British one reportedly on the way). Rather than sitting in his wheelchair waving his stick at the screen, Scorsese is still fighting. He is the best defender the medium has ever had."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
