Rough Trade records have had success servicing that demographic and with Palma Violets, they seem to be shooting for something a bit more original. Sam Fryer and Chilli Jesson clearly fancy themselves as songwriters in a romantic-rock tradition, but in practice their songs get lost in thrashy, posing performances. At this stage, they're more like the posh Cribs. Camp &amp; Furnace, Liverpool, Sat; Bodega, Nottingham, Mon; Nation Of Shopkeepers, Leeds, Tue; The Deaf Institute, Manchester, Wed; The Sugarmill, Stoke-on-Trent, Fri John Robinson Nas, London On his new album, Nas makes a point of calling out fans who are \"trapped in the 90s\". It's a funny moment: the 90s were a mixed bag for Nas. He began his beef with Jay-Z, who later decimated him in his song Takeover. On a more positive note, it was also when Nas recorded easily his best album: Illmatic. It was a bleak and cinematic view of project life widely reckoned as a game-changer. A rap Definitely Maybe, Illmatic made Nas's name, but also raised unreasonable expectations about what he might be capable of. The last 20 years have not all been good for the MC \u2013 platinum records; but also unpaid tax bills and divorce \u2013 however, it's the last of these that's on his mind. Life Is Good is a strangely nostalgic album, featuring a shout-out to his ex-wife Kelis, and plenty of references to when life (and hip-hop itself) seemed so much simpler. Under The Bridge, SW6, Mon; Village Underground, EC2, Tue; XOYO, EC2, Wed JR Tusk Festival, Newcastle upon Tyne Newcastle's Tusk is an event that remains full of adventure. Neither market driven or \"boutique\", it's one of those out-of-London fests like Glasgow's Instal and Birmingham's Supersonic that seems simply driven by enthusiasm and a sense of possibility. The headliners represent a number of current modes: the vaporous electronic flotation of Gate, deconstructed avant-blues from the Keiji Haino-fronted Fushitsusha and Pelt's electronically mangled-guitar raga drones. It's not easy listening \u2013 but when is anything worth doing ever easy? Star &amp; Shadow Cinema, Fri to 7 Oct JR Fred Hersch, London Maybe it's his rather sober, college-don appearance, but the Cincinnati-born piano master Fred Hersch perhaps invites audiences to expect a serious, concentrated, even prolix kind of jazz. But though Hersch may be a studious avoider of the obvious, he is \u2013 like his pupils Brad Mehldau and the Bad Plus's Ethan Iverson \u2013 an absolutely engrossing musical storyteller whose accessible lyricism reaches way beyond the cognoscenti. Hersch is also a very fine composer, and this rare solo-piano UK tour is likely to feature plenty of his own pieces alongside the imaginative and technically awesome variations on standards and classic pop songs that he's equally famous for. Tributes to Bill Frisell, Lee Konitz and his original model Bill Evans may surface, but these will be varied and intelligently-conceived contemporary performances reworked at the edge of the envelope. Purcell Room, SE1, Tue; Apex, Bury St Edmunds, Wed; St George's, Bristol, Thu; Turner Sims Hall, Southampton, Fri John Fordham Trish Clowes, On tour A few decades back, crossovers of jazz and classical music were often greeted with suspicion by fans of both \u2013 but cross-genre dialogues have become more common, and the former Royal Academy saxophonist Trish Clowes is one of the most agile and original jugglers of improv and adventurous composition to have appeared in the UK in recent times. Clowes made a big impact with her 2010 album Tangent, in which her gliding, soft-toned tenor sax was supported by a full string section, an improv-savvy string quartet \u2013 including rising young violin star Thomas Gould \u2013 and the piano mastery of Gwilym Simcock. The follow-up, And In The Night-time She Is There (which is a line from Oscar Wilde's The Sphinx turned into a song on the album) draws on similar resources, as Clowes's coolly imaginative sax-playing grows steadily more assured. Kings Place, N1, Sat; Gateway Education And Arts Centre, Shrewsbury, Thu; Sage, Gateshead, Fri JF The Emperor Of Atlantis, London English Touring Opera's (ETO) autumn season is made up of three 20th-century works. Two of them are familiar \u2013 Britten's comic opera Albert Herring and Maxwell-Davies's taut one-acter, The Lighthouse \u2013 but the third, Viktor Ullmann's The Emperor of Atlantis will be less well known. Ullmann composed it for the inmates of Theresienstadt, the concentration camp where he died after bring interned by the Nazis, though the performance was cancelled when camp authorities realised its satirical nature. It premiered in Amsterdam in 1975, though in Britain performances have been rare. ETO's production, directed by James Conway, will remedy that.
