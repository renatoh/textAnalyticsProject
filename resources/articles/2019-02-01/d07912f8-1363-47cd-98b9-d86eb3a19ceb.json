Leroy San\u00e9 and Riyad Mahrez scored the other goals as the Premier League champions won 4-1 to break Newport\u2019s brave resistance. \u201cPhil has to compete with Kevin [De Bruyne], with [Ilkay] G\u00fcndogan, with Bernardo Silva, with David Silva, but he\u2019s a player who is ready \u2013 ready to play,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cAnd today was a good test for him, with second balls, long balls, he had to adapt. He learned a lot, I\u2019m sure, and he helped us to win the game with two incredible goals. We know that he\u2019s a guy who [gets] close to the box and has this mentality to score goals, and he has the ability to do that. He was brilliant. He was top.\u201d Although City dominated possession, the scoreline flattered them a little, given that it was 2-1 with only one minute of normal time remaining. P\u00e1draig Amond, capitalising on a mistake by Aymeric Laporte, lobbed Ederson to briefly spark hopes of a Newport fightback, only for Foden and Mahrez to strike again for City. Guardiola, who picked a strong team, was full of praise for Newport on and off the field. Asked about the atmosphere, the City manager said: \u201cI\u2019m quite surprised. The support of the team was incredible, chanting \u2018Who are you?\u2019 was nice. I understand completely why Leicester and Middlesbrough suffer a lot in this stadium. It was tight [tonight] \u2013 we scored the third goal just before 90 minutes. But we knew the game would be tight. \u201cWhat they do, they do incredibly. They attack the channels with long balls, in the second balls they are physical and strong, every throw-in and free-kick they are always dangerous because they train a lot and do it really well.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
