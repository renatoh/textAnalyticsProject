Few horses can have divided opinion as much this season as Canford Cliffs. Beaten at odds-on in the Greenham, some could not wait to write him off as a one-race wonder on the strength of that freakish display in the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot 12 months ago. But those who kept the faith drew encouragement from his third behind Makfi and Dick Turpin at Newmarket, and then got paid out at the Curragh three weeks later when he bolted up in the Irish Guineas. The problem for those who want to take Ladbrokes' best offer of 6-4 about him maintaining the winning run next week is that Makfi is surely just as capable of improving upon his Guineas form given his progressive profile and the late start he made to his career. However, at 8-1 (with several firms offering a quarter the odds for each-way punters), it would be wrong to overlook the claims of Siyouni, for whom Christophe Lemaire must desert Makfi on account of his retainer for the Aga Khan. Siyouni trailed home a long way back when favourite for the French Guineas on his latest start, but Lemaire essentially gave up the ghost as soon as his mount's winning chance was extinguished by trouble in running and that sympathetic treatment may now reap dividends. The winner of the Grand Crit\u00e9rium last year, Siyouni was defeated on his comeback when he failed to reel back his pacemaker, which seemed to dent his reputation. But he got the better of a good scrap for second with Lope de Vega who on Sunday spreadeagled his rivals in the Prix du Jockey Club. Siyouni's trainer Alain de Royer-Dupr\u00e9 took this race in 1999 with the Aga's Sendawar. The Royal meeting has seemed to start with a whimper in recent years with the crowds lowest on the first of the five days and many racegoers appearing more interested in riding the escalators and bagging a good table for the rest of the week than in concentrating on the action on the track. But if ever there was an incentive for the racing purist to take a day off and get down to Ascot next week it is the three fascinating Group One contests, each offering punters a different puzzle, that get the action under way on Tuesday. Paco Boy was an easy winner of the Queen Anne 12 months ago, but he had nothing of the calibre of Goldikova and Rip Van Winkle in opposition and looks vulnerable now, not least having finished well held behind those rivals in previous meetings. To me, he ought to be the clear outsider of the three. Nicconi heads the betting for the King's Stand Stakes and has been well supported, but at 4-1 with Coral and even at the widely available 7-2, there may yet be some juice to be squeezed out of that price. Australian runners have won four of the last seven renewals and with his trainer David Hayes set to appear at a press conference to be held today, you can expect to see and hear plenty about Nicconi's considerable chances in the next 24 hours, so taking the price now looks sensible, especially given the booking of Frankie Dettori."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
