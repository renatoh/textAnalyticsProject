Speaking days before the start of this year\u2019s event, Eavis, 40, who has been booking acts at Glastonbury for half her life, said she was often the only woman in meetings with music moguls. Some male executives still insisted on speaking to her father, Michael Eavis, 83, who co-created the festival at the family\u2019s Worthy Farm in Somerset, she said. \u201cThe live music world has been so male-dominated,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Desert Island Discs. \u201cI go to meetings with just tables of men. Some were great, and some just refuse to accept that they had to deal with me.\u201d Eavis reaffirmed her aim of creating an equal gender balance of performers, after the Guardian revealed in 2015 that the lineup then was 86% male. \u201cWe are working toward 50/50. Some years it\u2019s 60/40. It\u2019s a challenge for us and we\u2019ve really taken it on and I\u2019m always totally conscious every day that the gender balance should be right.\u201d She added: \u201cEvery day when I\u2019m booking I\u2019m thinking about that and cajoling stage bookers to be onboard with it. Some of them have been here a long time so it\u2019s a little bit of hustle. But we\u2019re getting there.\u201d Kylie Minogue, Miley Cyrus and Janet Jackson are among the big acts this year, alongside the Killers, the Cure and Stormzy. Eavis has complained about sexism in the industry since she first started booking acts at one of the world\u2019s largest music festivals. Speaking to the Observer in 2009, she said: \u201cPeople didn\u2019t take it seriously coming from a girl, especially as not only was I a girl, but a \u2018daughter of\u2019 \u2026 but my dad has in no way given this to me in a nicely wrapped package. He has challenged me, made sure I can do it.\u201d Eavis also told Desert Island Discs her family were often the brunt of local anger at the festival when she was a child in the 1980s. \u201cWe used to have people shouting at us when we drove through the village. At the time it felt like we were part of something really controversial and everyone had an opinion, and they used to just let us know. You\u2019d be at a Christmas drinks party and someone would just come over and start shouting.\u201d Eavis said she was not a fan of the festival as a child, and was troubled by the arrival of so many strangers on her family\u2019s land. She said the event could be \u201cpretty scary at times\u201d during the early days. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 June 2019 to correct the spelling of Kylie Minogue\u2019s first name."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
