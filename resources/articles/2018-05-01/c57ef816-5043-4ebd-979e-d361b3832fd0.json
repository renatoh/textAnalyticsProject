No sooner had Celtic made history by becoming the first team to claim back-to-back Scottish domestic trebles than their manager, Brendan Rodgers, was speaking of a need for improvement. Motherwell were seen off 2-0 in Saturday\u2019s Scottish Cup final with Callum McGregor and Olivier Ntcham scoring the goals. Amid jubilant scenes, Rodgers looked to next season. \u201cI need to push even harder now next year in relation to developing the players here first and foremost,\u201d Celtic\u2019s manager said. \u201cAnd then bringing in players who can make a difference. It\u2019s a constant need to improve. \u201cWe have a really young group that are improving and developing but to make a difference at that level needs greater quality. We have to invest and improve. But the reality is that we can\u2019t spend fortunes because there\u2019s not masses of money there to do that.\u201d Rodgers added: \u201cThe trophies are always brilliant, they\u2019re there in the cupboard but for me it\u2019s always been about seeing players improve. That\u2019s what my strength is, I think. So seeing individuals get better, which hopefully makes the team better and should accumulate most of the time in winning \u2013 that\u2019s the biggest thing. \u201cI think what we gained from this year is that when you\u2019re not always at your best you can still win. That\u2019s important. We had 61 games, that\u2019s a lot of training and preparation and big-game mentality. The players will come out of this confident. They will get a bit of a longer rest this time as well. As a manager I have to push them harder.\u201d As if to back up his words, Rodgers met with the representatives of Odsonne \u00c9douard on Sunday as Celtic look to sign the striker from Paris Saint-Germain. \u00c9douard has been on loan at Celtic this season but missed the cup final because of a hamstring injury. Slightly strangely, Rodgers refuses to cite European football as a priority, despite recurring domestic success. The former Liverpool manager continues to focus on why Celtic cannot make meaningful inroads in the Champions League or Europa League, as opposed to why they can. Under Neil Lennon, Celtic beat Barcelona and made the Champions League last 16. The club\u2019s balance sheet is stronger than ever. \u201cWithout being defeatist it\u2019s always going to be very, very difficult for us,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cThe first challenge is to qualify and we have extra games [to do that]. It depends what success is in Europe. What is success in Europe for a Scottish club?\u201d Steven Gerrard\u2019s arrival at Rangers has spiked interest but Rodgers was unwilling to talk up the scale of that rivalry at the end of such a successful domestic season. Gerrard fired a warning to Celtic last week by insisting Rodgers and his players have \u201chad it their own way for far too long\u201d but their was no public counter-blow. \u201cIt\u2019s not a conversation,\u201d Rodgers insisted. \u201cTalk about Aberdeen. Aberdeen were second. Derek McInnes has done a brilliant job. Talk about them.\u201d As a supporter of his own club, Rodgers continues to revel in the fulfilment of a dream. He admits he could not have contemplated such a stunning level of success over successive Scottish seasons. \u201cYou could never imagine it could go as well as it has,\u201d said the 45-year-old. \u201cFrom the first day I walked in to the club it\u2019s been amazing. \u201cIt\u2019s always complex, it\u2019s never as easy as it seems when you win, a lot of stuff goes on behind the scenes, a lot of work, the brilliant staff and the club has really supported me in my time here, strategically. All the interests are aligned at the club and that allows me to work in confidence. But to think we\u2019d be standing here two years later having created history. No, I\u2019d be lying if I said I thought that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
