When he established his medical practice in the Townsville suburb of Idalia, he checked the area\u2019s flood history. He hired surveyors and spoke to the council. There was, they all said, little to worry about. After flood water unexpectedly came through the Fairfield Central shopping centre last week, Clements and other shop owners attempted to lodge insurance claims. Most found that their policies did not cover floods. Across Townsville, there are dozens of similar stories: residents and small business owners trying to establish how they were exposed to the unprecedented storm. Some blame town planners, who rated their properties as flood-free. Some blame insurance companies. Others the dam operators. In each case, decisions were based around the risk of a \u201cone-in-100-year\u201d flood. The monsoonal downpour that hit Townsville was much more severe. \u2018I was very embarrassed and ashamed\u2019 \u201cThere\u2019s a very well-established [one in 100 years] flood level that the town planners talked about, that architects talked about, and we were well aware of it,\u201d Clements told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe as a family heavily invested in Townsville and \u2026 we thought Idalia was an ideal suburb and environment. We certainly did look at the flood history. We talked to our conveyancers and solicitors and planners. They said you\u2019re well above the level, so flood is not a predictable and regular occurrence.\u201d Clements said he had approached an insurance broker, explained the technical risks, and asked for a policy. The broker did not mention that flooding was not covered. \u201cWhen I called up the insurance [company] I fully expected them to say: Here you go, you\u2019re covered. The first thing they did was call me back the next day and tell me I wasn\u2019t covered for flood. \u201cI was very embarrassed and ashamed when I found out ... I\u2019m so risk-averse as a business owner. Almost every other shop owner in the same centre is in the same boat. They thought they were covered but they\u2019re covered for storm, not flood.\u201d Planning does not account for extremes Experts have increasingly warned about the limitations of the one-in-100-year flood level for planning purposes. A risk management expert, Andrew Gissing, said councils and governments were not consistent in the information they gave residents. Some provided modelling based on extreme scenarios \u2013 one in 1,000 years or the \u201cprobable maximum flood\u201d \u2013 while others stuck to the \u201cone-in-100-year\u201d designation. \u201cIf a government authority has information about a natural hazard risk, \u2026 they should be making that freely and easily available to the community,\u201d Gissing said. \u201cThis was an extreme event. We need to consider extreme events in our planning.\u201d Confusion about insurance policies Insurers have been called to a government roundtable in Townsville this Friday. Most policies cover flooding as standard but it is not a requirement. Some specifically exclude it. On others, it is an optional extra. The concern in Townsville is that people have opted for the cheaper option, in the belief their properties were not at risk. According to an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission report last year, insurance in cyclone-prone north Queensland can be three to five times more expensive than elsewhere. The state\u2019s deputy premier, Jackie Trad, has called on insurance companies to be \u201ccompassionate and fair\u201d when assessing claims. The Insurance Council of Australia says customers who did not have flood cover should still lodge a claim. \u201cMost policies include storm cover,\u201d its chief executive, Rob Whelan, said last week. \u201cWhere flood cover was not purchased, it will typically be tested by the insurer through an independent hydrology process. This will determine if the inundation that caused the damage is to be classified as flood water or as storm water.\u201d Dam statistics The management of the Ross River dam remains under the microscope more than a week after the release of water caused most of the inundation of Townsville\u2019s suburbs. As Guardian Australia revealed last week, the dam\u2019s management plan was based on a one-in-100-year flood but studies showed the strategy would cause more extensive damage in extreme scenarios. Based on the number of flooded properties \u2013 at last estimate about 3,000 \u2013 and the rate of the water sent streaming from the dam, the flooding was on par with a one-in-1,000-year event. The state government is holding an inquiry, which is likely to investigate the way the government-owned SunWater and the Townsville city council managed the dam. The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, was this week grilled in parliament about SunWater\u2019s role. She denied it had refused a request from the council to release extra water from the dam during the first few days of a week-long deluge. Palaszczuk said the flood was the result of climate change and \u201cthe manual was followed\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
