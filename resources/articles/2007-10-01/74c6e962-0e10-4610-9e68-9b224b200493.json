Finding fault with our rulers and representatives is an essential and occasionally even a constructive part of what we do. But there is one set of charges against politicians that life has taught me to avoid. These are the charges that there are no real differences between them, that they are all more or less the same, and that therefore it doesn't matter which of them wins and governs. In my experience none of these charges is true. Claims that the candidates are indistinguishable and narrow the overall political spectrum have surfaced again this week about the rivals to succeed Menzies Campbell's as Liberal Democrat leader. According to an arresting Guardian G2 cover on Wednesday (though John Harris's story inside was considerably more nuanced), Nick Clegg and Chris Huhne are not only white, middle-aged, male and went to the same school, but their politics are also almost identical. So what, the headline then asked, does this tell us about Westminster today? To which my answer is this. The headline tells us rather less about Westminster than it tells us about the assumptions of the person who wrote it. From what I've seen over the years, the claim that politicians are all the same or that it doesn't make any difference is frequently made and invariably false, while the fact that many people believe and encourage such falsehoods is disturbing and even dangerous. It would be idiotic to exaggerate the differences between Clegg and Huhne. They are both, after all, in the same party. It is therefore not exactly shocking that their politics are fairly similar. But there are also genuine differences between the two men - and these differences matter. Don't exaggerate them, but don't underestimate them either. In time they may matter not just to the Lib Dems, but to British party politics in general and even, depending on whether the party of liberal values now bombs or soars, to British life. For instance, Clegg says the Lib Dems risk extinction unless they face up to questions that make the party uncomfortable but which agitate the voters, like the need for immigration control or the sometimes malign incompetence of parts of the public sector. Huhne has more identifiably social democratic priorities, like redistributive tax policies, the centrality of public services to achieving social justice and a more root-and-branch approach to green issues. Clegg thinks Huhne is too cautious and too puritanical. Huhne thinks Clegg is not clear and not grounded. In other words there is a real choice here. In the end, the outcome of the contest between the two men is likely to depend upon whether the party is more afraid of losing many of its seats - in which case Clegg will probably win - or losing its soul - which in turn will help Huhne. The larger point, though, is that the differences between the two candidates are real. They are not Manichean, but nor are they confected or trivial. And if we try to tease out the implications, it gradually becomes clearer that the choice will affect everything else in British politics. This larger point is true of far more than just the Clegg-Huhne contest. It applies to the British party battle generally. Here too we hear regular moans that they are all the same - when the simple truth is that they are not. Indeed the same people who make such a show of saying that the contest to succeed Campbell is not really a contest at all are often also in the forefront of those who fume that both the Labour and Conservative parties, and now also the Liberal Democrats (this last often said in a tone of post-Iraq regret) are supposedly all much of a muchness, fighting over the same centre-ground and failing to offer the voters what they allegedly really want - a so-called real contest. Freud famously talked about the narcissism of small differences. But there is also a narcissism of refusing to take real things seriously. The liberal bien-pensants who say they're all the same have got form. Their form goes back much further than the end of the cold war and the collapse of socialism, even though those who make the charge often like to imply that \"real\" contests involving \"real\" choices were the norm a generation or two ago. They should get real themselves, because half a century ago they were just as ready to bemoan the choices on offer then too. They were wrong then. And they are wrong now. In Britain, long before they bemoaned the hegemony of Blairism, they complained loudly about the hegemony of Butskellism - the postwar convergence between Tory and Labour on the managed economy and the welfare state - and criticised Harold Wilson for importing the techniques of Madison Avenue into British campaigning. In America 50 years ago, this kind of liberal disdain towards politics was even more pronounced. In 1960 it became fashionable to bemoan the inauthentic, allegedly made-for-TV candidacy of John F Kennedy. The late Arthur Schlesinger was moved to write a powerful book titled: Kennedy or Nixon? Does it Make any Difference? Today, knowing what we know now about Kennedy and Nixon, the title seems extraordinary and the question answers itself. But not then, not for some people. Nor did it make any difference for the same people in 1968 when they sat on their hands and allowed Nixon to defeat Hubert Humphrey. And, a generation on, in the 2000 US election, it was once again fashionable to deny the importance of politics and the fact of any significant differences between the main candidates. Bush and Gore were mocked by the same bien-pensant tradition on both sides of the Atlantic as Gush and Bore, two sides of the same centrist coin. Once again, Lady Disdain handed the election to the Republicans, to the eternal shame of those who allowed it to happen. The differences between Clegg and Huhne are as nothing when compared with those between Bush and Gore. But the enduring progressive heresy that says none of the candidates is good enough for radical sensibility is a leitmotiv of all modern politics. We are already hearing it in this country as the contest between Gordon Brown and David Cameron takes shape. We always hear it. They always say it. And they are always wrong because they are not serious. martin.kettle@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
