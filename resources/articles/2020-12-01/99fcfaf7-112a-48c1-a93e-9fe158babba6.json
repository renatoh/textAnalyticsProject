Intrigue surrounds what may have been exposed, from nuclear secrets to Covid-19 vaccine data to next-generation weapons systems. On Sunday, the Texas company SolarWinds alerted thousands of customers that an \u201coutside nation state\u201d had found a back door into software tool utilized by some of the biggest government agencies and companies in the United States. These hackers are consummate professionals at covering their tracks, experts said. Some theft may never be detected. But the campaign \u2013 which cybersecurity experts said exhibits the tactics and techniques of Russia\u2019s SVR foreign intelligence agency \u2013 will rank among the most prolific in the annals of cyberespionage. US government agencies, including the treasury and commerce departments, were among dozens of high-value public and private sector targets known to have been infiltrated as far back as March through a commercial software update distributed to thousands of SolarWinds clients worldwide. A US government statement indicated the Pentagon used the software. It said it had \u201cissued guidance and directives to protect\u201d its networks. It would not say \u2013 for \u201coperational security reasons\u201d \u2013 whether any of its systems may have been hacked. The acting defense secretary, Chris Miller, told CBS News on Tuesday there was so far no evidence of compromise. In the months since the update went out, the hackers carefully exfiltrated data, often encrypting it so it wasn\u2019t clear what was being taken, and making sophisticated efforts at covering their tracks. Thomas Rid, a Johns Hopkins University cyber conflict expert, said the campaign\u2019s likely efficacy can be compared to Russia\u2019s three-year 1990s \u201cMoonlight Maze\u201d hacking of US government targets, including Nasa and the Pentagon. A US investigation determined the height of the documents stolen \u2013 if printed out and piled up \u2013 would be three times the height of the Washington Monument in the nation\u2019s capital. In this case \u201cseveral Washington Monument piles of documents that they took from different government agencies is probably a realistic estimate\u201d, Rid said. \u201cHow would they use that? They themselves most likely don\u2019t know yet.\u201d The Trump administration has not put out details of agencies were hacked. And so far no private-sector victims have come forward. Traditionally, defense contractors and telecommunications companies have been popular targets with state-backed cyber spies, Rid said. Intelligence agents generally seek the latest on weapons technologies and missile defense systems, and develop dossiers on rival government employees, potentially for recruitment as spies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
