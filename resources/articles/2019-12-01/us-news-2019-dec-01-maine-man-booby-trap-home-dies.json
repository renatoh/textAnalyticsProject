Ronald Cyr, 65, called 911 early Thursday evening, telling operators that he had been shot, the Van Buren police department said on Facebook. Police and medics went to the scene and gave Cyr medical assistance. \u201cRegretfully, Mr Cyr succumbed to the injuries he sustained from the gunshot,\u201d authorities said. Officers learned that the front door of Cyr\u2019s home was \u201coutfitted with a device designed to fire a handgun should anyone attempt to enter the door.\u201d They discovered \u201cother unknown devices\u201d and subsequently called Maine state police bomb squad. The agencies investigated Cyr\u2019s home into the early morning hours of 29 November; authorities determined that he was shot \u201cas the result of the unintentional discharge of one of his homemade devices\u201d. Two people reached by the Guardian, who said they were family members, claimed their brother\u2019s home had long been targeted by burglars and voiced frustration toward authorities. Mark and Lorraine, who identified themselves as two of Ronald\u2019s siblings, said Ronald had long complained that items such as tools and car painting supplies had gone missing. They alleged that Ronald Cyr complained to authorities, but police treated him \u201clike he was senile\u201d, Mark claimed. The police department could not be reached for additional comment. \ufeffHe was afraid,\u201d Mark said. \u201cThe cops wouldn\u2019t do nothing so he took matters [into his own hands].\u201d The pair said Ronald had tried using fences and security cameras to protect his home, but he eventually turned to traps a few years ago. \u201cWe were not in favor of him doing that because he wasn\u2019t used to guns \u2013 really, that was not his forte \u2013 but he was so frustrated,\u201d Lorraine said. Van Buren, population 2,171, is situated across from Saint-Leonard, New Brunswick, Canada. The town is approximately 320 miles from Portland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
