It was the first time many of our young readers felt anything like relevance to, let alone empowerment within, a political system that has alienated them utterly. The Observer \u2013 a broad church, to which I\u2019m doggedly loyal \u2013 responded to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s landslide with an editorial foreseeing inevitable failure at a general election of the mandate on which he won. For what it\u2019s worth, I felt we let down many readers and others by not embracing at least the spirit of the result, propelled as it was by moral principles of equality, peace and justice. These are no longer tap-room dreams but belong to a mass movement in Britain, as elsewhere in Europe. It came as a disappointment \u2013 as I suspect it did to others who supported Corbyn, or were interested \u2013 to find such a consensus ready to pour cold water on the parade. To behold so little curiosity towards, let alone sympathy with, why this happened. Of course the rest of the media were in on the offensive. Our sister paper the Guardian had endorsed a candidate who lost, humiliated; the Tory press barons performed to script. Here was a chance for the Observer to stand out from the crowd. But instead, we conjoined the chorus with our own \u2013 admittedly more progressive \u2013 version of this obsession with electoral strategy with little regard to what Corbyn says about the principles of justice, peace and equality (or less inequality). It came across as churlish, I\u2019m sure, to many readers on a rare day of something different. I accept that we are a reformist paper, and within those parameters one has to get elected. But that should not mean a digging-in by, and with, the parliamentary inside-baseball Labour party whose days and ways of presenting politics like corporate management selling a product (or explaining a product fault) have just been soundly rejected by its membership. Why embed with MPs in a parliament no one trusts against the democratic vote outside it? And anyway, what if? Who, five years ago, would have predicted Syriza\u2019s victory in Greece or bet on Podemos taking Madrid and Barcelona, now preparing for a role in government? It\u2019s not as though the Observer\u2019s accumulated editorials disagree that much with Corbyn. During Ed Miliband\u2019s Labour, the Observer robustly questioned the health of capitalism \u2013 our columnist Will Hutton calls it \u201cturbo-capitalism\u201d. We urged support for a living wage and the working poor, and the likes of Robert Reich and David Simon have filled our pages with more radical critiques of capitalism than Corbyn\u2019s. Anyway, how much of what Corbyn argues do most voters disagree with, if they stop to think? Do people approve of bewildering, high tariffs set by the cartel of energy companies, while thousands of elderly people die each winter of cold-related diseases? Do students and parents from middle- and low-income families want tuition fees? Do people like paying ludicrous fares for signal-failure, delays and overcrowding on inept railways? Do people urge tax evasion by multinationals and billionaires, which they then subsidise with cuts to the NHS? Post-cold war, who exactly are we supposed to kill en masse with these expensive nuclear missiles? What\u2019s so good about the things Corbyn wants to drastically change? Even more fundamental is the appeal to principle and morality \u2013 peace, justice and internationalism \u2013 which drove the Labour grassroots vote, and was spoken at the rally for refugees which Corbyn made his first engagement and for which this newspaper stands absolutely. Why not embrace those principles, or at least show an interest in the fact that hundreds of thousands of people just did? Which better reflects the Britain we want: Corbyn\u2019s \u201copen your hearts\u201d or Cameron\u2019s \u201cswarm\u201d? The parliamentary bubble \u2013 and our editorial \u2013 calculate that we cannot fundamentally change Britain on the basis of these aspirations, even if many people yearn to. In the acceptance speech, Corbyn should have appealed beyond the party in which he is steeped; perhaps he too inhabits a different echo-chamber. But this isn\u2019t about Corbyn, it\u2019s about why he\u2019s suddenly there. And what an appalling lesson to draw: someone is overwhelmingly elected to falteringly but seriously challenge that stasis and order of things \u2013 by urging peace, justice, republic and equality \u2013 only to be evicted by the deep system into a lethal ice-storm the moment he leaves the tent, like Captain Oates, though not of his own volition. And even if middle England is more adverse to radical politics than middle Spain or Greece, does that mean we have to align with this mainstream stasis, just because it is so? What\u2019s the point of principles if their trade-off for power is a principle in itself? Why have principles at all? The legal philosopher Costas Douzinas argues for a separation of words: using \u201cpolitics\u201d to describe horse-trading between parties, which feign differences but actually agree, and \u201cthe political\u201d to describe antagonisms that really exist in society. On that basis, why start with the stasis of \u201cpolitics\u201d to approach \u201cthe political\u201d, rather than the reverse: invoke \u201cthe political\u201d to challenge the stasis of \u201cpolitics\u201d? Especially alongside Greece, Spain and elsewhere. Instead of a stirring leader, which did not have to endorse Corbyn but could celebrate the spirit of the vote along with those who delivered it, we\u2019ve left a lot of good, loyal and decent people who read our newspaper feeling betrayed. \u201cThere\u2019s something happening in here / What it is ain\u2019t exactly clear\u201d, wrote Stephen Stills in 1967. It\u2019s a good description of where we are with all this \u2013 we don\u2019t as yet have the map whence this came, where it\u2019s going or even what it is. Dave Crosby sang: \u201cDon\u2019t try to get yourself elected\u201d (from a mighty number called \u201cLong Time Gone\u201d). Along with almost half this country, I was inclined to agree, but Corbyn\u2019s election throws Crosby\u2019s dictum into question, just as to cut Corbyn down would prove Crosby right. \u201cWe can change the world\u201d sang Graham Nash. But are we only allowed to try if middle England, the media and parliament try too?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
