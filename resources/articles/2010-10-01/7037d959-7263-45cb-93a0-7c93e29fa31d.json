There was a fresh flowering in his cheeks when he later discussed his wonderful, his own, Chicharito. \"The way he took his chance, it was like shelling peas,\" Ferguson said, appearing, as he can on these occasions, jarringly sweet and doting. It is a truth universally acknowledged that a fresh-faced, new-favourite-toy young player can have a reanimating effect on even the most beaten-down and spatchcocked dug-out grump. This already looks like a beautiful relationship in the offing \u2013 and one that Ferguson probably needs, too. It is important to remember that young, slippery, talented foreign players are still the most perplexing challenge for a manager. In our island-football culture players are still divided into two groups: normal and foreign. The foreigner must be addressed. He must be mastered. With ageing managers their nose for foreigners \u2013 the foreigner instinct \u2013 is often the first thing to go, like an old dog's sense of smell or the steering on a rust-peppered Rover estate. Many successful English managers were effectively killed off by the first great wave of foreigners. Howard Wilkinson, the last to win the league, never grasped the new world. Instead he found himself lassoed and bound, Gulliver-like, by the foreigners' tiny hands, quick feet and alien skill sets. Over time we learnt some basic rules. Russians are complex. A Portuguese may fade. Don't overpay for a Scandinavian. Your club's first Brazilian will be a disappointment. In fact, like port always being passed to the left, a Brazilian should only ever arrive from the West. Never go East: the fossil-fuel funded, post-Soviet Brazilian tends to age badly, glove-bound and tight\u2011chafed, wizened by winter. Foreigners have always been important for Ferguson who alone among top managers, straddles the pre- and post-foreigner eras. While other modern managers focus on massed coaching staffs as central to their dug-out identity \u2013 witness the many fluffers and groupies of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's entourage \u2013 Ferguson is careless with his assistants. Mike Phelan already has the air of a faithful mid-period second wife, destined to Hoover and bake and look pinched and troubled in his apron, before obediently disappearing to live in a bungalow in Bridport. For Ferguson it is instead a mastery of the foreign, a refusal to be outflanked, that has been central to his professional thrust. Not that there haven't been some disasters. At times his forays into the foreign can even seem a little hobby-ish and derivative: the Makelele-cartoon Eric Djemba-Djemba, the Thierry Henry-ish stab with David Bellion. Paying \u00a328m for Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n was like buying a big flash yellow motorbike that ends up just sitting in your front garden looking pointlessly sleek for a couple of years. During the recent scouting trip to Valencia it was hard to shake the image of Ferguson looking rather glazed and awkward in the stands beneath his gift-shop sombrero, like the assistant manager of a regional double-glazing firm peer-pressured into performing a stiff-backed limbo at a Sandals Jamaican beach party. But the hits have outweighed the misses and in many ways Ferguson has measured out his reign in an unbroken lineage of key foreigners. The first was Eric Cantona: the Scot's first Statement Foreigner, a show of regal pan-European modernity to be paraded Kong-like past the gasping crowds, flexing his furred biceps, magnificently devouring a banana. After which the baton of key foreigner arguably passed to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who seemed to say: foreigners? No big deal. We source them. We nurture them. They're a bit like us. Most recently Cristiano Ronaldo became the central figure as Ferguson's player pool took on a Latin and southern European shade, Beb\u00e9-ridden and Anderson\u2011inflected. The old polarity with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger still exists here. Even now Wenger retinas his aura as the master of all foreigners, curator of a frictionless poly\u2011lingual bazaar peopled by Syldavians, Etruscans, Wookiees, Smurfs. This is not without its ongoing ructions and resentments. The current Arsenal goalkeeper debate (it is a proper debate: on Thursday night Sky Sports News had a scrolling message that read, \"Where do you stand on the Arsenal goalkeeper debate?\" \u2013 so it must be) has been seized upon with barely disguised glee as a coded case of foreigner confusion. Even Wenger suffers, it seems, with his oddly excitable goalkeepers, these cartwheeling spiky-haired showmen with their air of frazzled defiance. Despite Wenger's fluency in this area, Ferguson's relationship with foreign players still feels somehow more urgent and personal. It seems significant that there has recently been a vacancy in the role of pet foreigner. Could Chicharito be the new project? He is certainly an appealing figure, an instant, fearless finisher, unusually limber in his leggy athleticism. They look good together, too, in an endearing, slipper-fetching, Wallace and Gromit-ish kind of way. Either way, in a season of tedious Rooney-blah and Glazer-wrangle, it is very nice to see Ferguson with a familiar spring in his step."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
