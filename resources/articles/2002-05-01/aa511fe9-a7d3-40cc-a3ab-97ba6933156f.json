In his deft determination to be a truly reforming leader of the Commons he has won the unexpected praise of MPs in all parties. Lord Irvine, Tony Blair's first boss and sometime patron, kept his job after the election, but - like Mr Cook - does not have the influence he once had over the novice prime minister. Lord Irvine and Mr Cook make an odd couple: the one large and menacing, the other compact, witty and ginger. Irvine QC, 61, made a fortune in the civil courts, but is rightly terrified that his political ineptitude will trip him up. Cook MP, is probably the smartest adversarial debater now working the Commons. Both men know they may be on their last big job. Both are determined to leave their mark on the fast-changing constitutional settlement of Britain. Yet Lord Irvine has stumbled on Lords reform and Mr Cook has picked up the baton. Lord Irvine was a key player in creating a successful blueprint for devolution in Scotland and Wales. He introduced the Human Rights Act, he was on the liberal side of the freedom of information debate. But closer to his own powers Lord Irvine has been more conservative, resisting calls for a separate justice department that would unscramble his mixture of political, judicial and administrative tasks. The Westminster rumour mill suggests he did not believe in the plan he promoted to have only 20% of a fully-reformed upper house elected - that it was done on Mr Blair's insistence. If so, he faltered badly. Lord Williams, the leader of the Lords, had to rescue him from angry MPs when he made a poor job of presenting his case. Mr Cook barely troubled to hide his disdain for the formula and looked for allies in both houses to break the logjam, but did so in ways that would not alienate cabinet colleagues who are instinctively bored with such matters - or provoke charges of disloyalty. In recent months the tide has turned his way. Even government whips were telling No 10 that Mr Blair was dangerously out of touch and indifferent to backbench opinion. That must have made it easier for Mr Cook to sell the current retreat in the name of inclusivity. What he must do now is keep the reformers' coalition together or the \"dark forces\" will hit back. It is not over yet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
