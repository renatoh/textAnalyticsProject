I thought Cyrus [Christie] was fantastic and he had a great shot. I think a clean sheet was very important, to give us that confidence.\u201d James McClean speaks. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t pretty, football-wise, but we dug in and showed a good attitude,\u201d the Republic of Ireland winger says. \u201cI think we started lively. They are a good side, they gave us a 5-1 drubbing here in November and we battled well. It is nice to a pick up a clean sheet, we defended well tonight but we need that cutting edge to put the ball in the net.\u201d What\u2019s going on with Germany? That 3-0 defeat is their fifth loss in 2018. Next up for Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s side? France, on Tuesday evening in Paris. Even more worryingly, it is thought to be the first time in their history that they have failed to score in three consecutive competitive matches; they have won three of their past 12 matches. As for the Netherlands, that is the first time they have beaten Germany by three or more goals. Armenia 0-1 Gibraltar Bulgaria 2-1 Cyprus Georgia 2-0 Andorra Latvia 1-1 Kazakhstan Macedonia 4-1 Liechtenstein Netherlands 3-0 Germany Norway 1-0 Slovenia Republic of Ireland 0-0 Denmark Slovakia 1-2 Czech Republic Drama in Dublin! Shane Duffy, the Ireland defender, is booked for diving after a brush with Henrik Dalsgaard in the box, well into two minutes of added time. There are penalty appeals and, for a moment, it looks inevitable, but the referee, Srdan Jovanovic, is having none of it. Duffy is aggrieved, and booked. Georginio Wijnaldum adds a third, and that\u2019s game over. Memphis Depay converts after good by Quincy Promes, the substitute. It is a devastating counter attack, with Promes galloping down the right before Depay dinks the ball over Neuer. Double Dutch etc etc ... Shane Long\u2019s barren run for Ireland goes on, with Aiden O\u2019Brien on for his home debut. Long last scored for his country on 9 October 2016. Up the other end, Martin Braithwaite has just tested Darren Randolph, though the Ireland goalkeeper saw it all the way. So, Ireland supporters are doing a half-hearted rendition of the Icelandic thunderclap. There are 13 minutes, plus added time, to play in Dublin. For Denmark, Anders Christiansen is on for Kasper Dolberg. In Amsterdam, Julian Brandt has been summoned by Germany, while the classy Nathan Ak\u00e9 is on for the Netherlands, in place of Frenkie de Jong. Cyrus Christie \u2013 of all people \u2013 stings the fingertips of Kasper Schmeichel! Ireland work it nicely, with Shane Long unselfishly teeing up the Fulham defender, who has been operating in midfield for most of this evening, to shoot at goal. He hits it with real venom, and the Denmark goalkeeper palms away for a corner. Ireland look to continue the momentum, with Callum Robinson flighting a ball in from the left. \u201cGermany have been fairly poor,\u201d emails Charles Antaki, \u201cpossibly because of on-going World-Cup rubbishness, but also possibly because they\u2019ve been mesmerised by Ryan Babel\u2019s hair. It\u2019s a sort of deep magenta, guaranteed to fix the eye and lead to wonderment.\u201d Job done in Skopje, you\u2019d imagine. Egzijan Alioski, the Leeds winger, has added a fourth goal. Victory would take Macedonia top of Group D4, with Gibraltar still bottom despite that win in Armenia earlier. Well, well, well. Meanwhile in Dublin, Robinson has replaced Harry Arter. Is that, essentially, Ireland going gung-ho? Overload? Martin O\u2019Neill has seen enough, with his team growing increasingly placid in this contest. \u201cThis is tir-eire-some to watch,\u201d moans my esteemed colleague, Will Unwin. Callum Robinson, the Preston North End striker, is about to jump off the bench. In Amsterdam, Julian Draxler has sent an effort sailing over for Germany, after being played in by fellow substitute Leroy San\u00e9. Can they find an equaliser? Let\u2019s wait and see. Simon Kjaer has his header cleared off the line by Harry Arter! The Denmark defender gets up at the front post to glance a corner goalwards, but the Cardiff City midfielder is there to hack away at the back post with a thumping left boot. The Danes, you sense, are turning the screw ... Kiril Despodov equalises for the hosts in Sofia. A pretty pedestrian start to the second half for both teams in Dublin, though you sense Denmark are slowly strengthening their grip. They are dominating possession, at least. In Holland, the Dutch defence are standing tall as Germany pile forward, with Toni Kroos and Matthias Ginter both charging into the box in search of a leveller. A double change for Joachim L\u00f6w too, with Leroy San\u00e9 and Julian Draxler handed half an hour to make a difference. M\u00fcller and Can have been withdrawn. Half-time substitution for Ireland: Enda Stevens has replaced Callum O\u2019Dowda, the midfielder who did take a whack. Elsewhere, there have been no changes in Amsterdam, where the Netherlands lead Germany. A quiet start to the second half in Dublin, but \u2013 hold on a minute \u2013 how about this zinger of a riposte from the Scotland and Liverpool defender Andy Robertson: We\u2019ve had to deal with all different things, but we keep going. I think the criticism\u2019s a bit harsh, but some people prefer when we do bad instead of when we do good. The last game wasn\u2019t good enough. But a lot of people look at the results, and we\u2019ve played a lot of tough games, which has been hard for the lads when we\u2019re trying to learn attack under a new manager. Without an influx of Macedonia-Liechtenstein chat sat in the inbox, here\u2019s an email from Edouard on that old chestnut: VAR. \u201cIt seems that everyone has now decided that if any body part sticks out beyond the last defender, that it is offside,\u201d he says. \u201cConsidering that I feel refereeing should inherently favour attacking play, and that I imagine the original intent of the offsides rule was to avoid hoofing it to a guy a few feet from goal, I am always resentful when commentators speak approvingly of extremely tight offsides. It seems like I am the only person who feels this way \u2013 is that true?\u201d Bulgaria 0-1 Cyprus Macedonia 3-1 Liechtenstein Netherlands 1-0 Germany Republic of Ireland 0-0 Denmark Pione Sisto hits the post for Denmark! A combination of some slack Irish defending and cute footwork leads the winger to the edge of the box, before dropping his shoulder and unleashing an effort goalwards. It\u2019s powerful and dipping, but kisses Darren Randolph\u2019s left post. Ireland cannot afford to give a player of his quality so much time and space. Shane Long buys another foul for Ireland, with Lasse Sch\u00f6ne forced into a clumsy challenge on halfway. Martin O\u2019Neill will be happy with aspects of this performance, but it has hardly been riveting. They have worked hard, pumped long throws into the box without really impressing. Denmark have been pretty poor, though almost prosper through Henrik Dalsgaard\u2019s beautiful deep cross \u2013 but Ireland\u2019s Matt Doherty eventually clears. Grigoris Kastanos, the young Juventus forward, opens the scoring. Shane Duffy heads wide for Ireland! Jeff Hendrick floats a wonderful free-kick from about 25 yards out in towards the six-yard box, and the centre-back is there to meet it but his effort drops off-target. The Brighton defender should have done better, in truth. Seyhan Yildiz pulls one back. In goal for the visitors is Benjamin B\u00fcchel, once of Bournemouth and Havant &amp; Waterlooville fame. Goran Pandev, these days of Genoa, adds a third for the hosts, who are now three goals to the good in Skopje. Aleksandar Trajkovski, the Palermo striker, has doubled his \u2013 and his country\u2019s \u2013 tally for the evening. Ronald Koeman\u2019s side take the lead, with Virgil van Dijk crashing home from close range after Ryan Babel rattled the crossbar. Denmark pry forward, with Thomas Delaney diving to meet a dinked ball into the box. He clatters Darren Randolph in the process, while Callum O\u2019Dowda is also down. He looks a little groggy. Meanwhile, Jon Dahl Tomasson, the former Milan striker, looks toasty in the dugout in Dublin. The Denmark assistant these days, alongside manager Age Hareide, Dahl Tomasson was capped 112 times by his country, scoring 57 goals. Talking of European legends, Rafael van der Vaart and Dirk Kuyt are both in Amsterdam to watch the Netherlands entertain Germany. Timo Werner has just fluffed his lines for Germany, after being put through by Thomas M\u00fcller. He drags his effort wide in the end, though Germany are very much in the ascendency in Amsterdam. For the Dutch, the highly-rated Frenkie de Jong has been busy, with the 21-year-old scythed down by Emre Can, now of Juventus. Ireland have started pretty brightly. Callum O\u2019Dowda has just fizzed in a free-kick from the right after Shane Long, who has been lively, won a foul out of Thomas Delaney. Simon Kjaer, the Denmark captain, clears for a corner but Ireland decide to play it short, and that\u2019s that, really. It\u2019s still 0-0 between the Netherlands and Germany in Amsterdam. Aleksandar Trajkovski puts the hosts ahead in Skopje. Harry Arter is booked for a bit of a lunge on Martin Braithwaite, the Middlesbrough forward. That was a little needless. Jeff Hendrick somehow shoots wide! But he only runs through on goal towards Kasper Schmeichel after seizing the ball from Thomas Delaney, who is looking at a hurt Harry Arter on halfway. Delaney cagily hangs on to the ball, gesticulating to stop play, but Hendrick nips in before whizzing past two Danish defenders. Really, Hendrick should score, but he fires wide. And a bit of a dust-up between the Irish and Danish players ensues, with Schmeichel particularly enraged about that. Denmark win an early free-kick, but Lasse Sch\u00f6ne\u2019s ball in does not beat the first man and Ireland will lap up that sort of delivery that up all day long. In Holland, the Netherlands have an early sniff of goal through Memphis Depay, but the forward is met by Manuel Neuer as he bares down on goal. And we\u2019re off. Martin O\u2019Neill, talking a little earlier, says he hopes for a high-octane start. \u201cWe want to be on the front foot,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have certain players here who I think will adjust. This is an opportunity while we\u2019re playing at home to go on the front foot. Matt Doherty will be playing in his normal position on the right-hand side as it\u2019s his first game for us.\u201d The teams are in the tunnel, from Dublin to Amsterdam, where Joachim L\u00f6w will preside over his 168th match as head coach of Germany, surpassing the 167-game record of Sepp Herberger. Alas, no Christian Eriksen for Denmark in Dublin, with the Tottenham midfielder missing with a stomach injury. He has scored 19 of their last 44 goals. \u201cHe\u2019s a good player, an important player for us, but we haven\u2019t focused on him not being there but on the players who are here,\u201d said Age Hareide. \u201cWe may have to play a different way without him but we have shown we have a lot of good players in Denmark. We don\u2019t want being without Christian to be an excuse after the game. We need to do our best.\u201d For the Republic of Ireland, there is another vote of confidence for Shane Long, who starts against Denmark. Se\u00e1n Maguire, Callum Robinson, Aiden O\u2019Brien and Scott Hogan, who all play their football in the Championship, are options from the bench. Ronan Curtis, the excellent Portsmouth forward, remains with Noel King\u2019s Under-21s, and his club seem to be coping without him just fine: A great night for Gibraltar, then \u2013 but it did not pass without a pre-match boo-boo. Before kick-off, they were incensed by the wrong national anthem being played, that of Liechtenstein. \u201cThe Armenian FA has apologised to the head of delegation representing the Gibraltar FA in Yerevan for this oversight and an announcement has been made at the national stadium apologising for the error,\u201d they said in a statement. Still, they have their first win in a competitive game at the 23rd time of asking. Gibraltar have just picked up their first ever points in a competitive international, and just their third ever win. As a country, they boast a population the same capacity as Middlesbrough\u2019s Riverside Stadium, but they have just beat an Armenia team featuring Henrikh Mkhitaryan 1-0, with Joseph Chipolina\u2019s second-half strike the difference in Yerevan. And with that, they have more Nations League victories than England. There are, of course, plenty of tears. Bulgaria v Cyprus Macedonia v Liechtenstein Netherlands v Germany Republic of Ireland v Denmark Armenia 0-1 Gibraltar Georgia 2-0 Andorra Latvia 1-1 Kazakhstan Norway 1-0 Slovenia Slovakia 1-2 Czech Republic Republic of Ireland: Randolph; Doherty, Duffy, Keogh, Long, Christie; McClean, Arter, Hendrick, O\u2019Dowda; Long Denmark: Schmeichel, Dalsgaard, Kjaer, Zanka, Stryger, Schone, Delaney, Braithwaite, Yurary, Sisto, Dolberg Netherlands: Cillessen, Dumfries, De Ligt, Van Dijk, Blind; De Roon, Wijnaldum, F De Jong; Bergwijn, Depay, Babel Germany: Neuer, Kimmich, Hector, Hummels, Ginter, Boateng, Kroos, Uth, Can, M\u00fcller, Werner The Republic of Ireland have painful memories of their last encounter with Denmark, with Christian Eriksen close to unplayable as he hit a hat-trick in the World Cup play-offs last November. Things can only get better for Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s side, surely? They are in a bit of a rut; bogged down by injuries and Roy Keane, as ever, has been ruffling a few feathers behind the scenes, while on the pitch, they\u2019re struggling to score goals at one end and keep them out at the other. \u201cIn truth, we don\u2019t have anyone who has proved themselves to be a prolific scorer, so it is a difficult one,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. As for Denmark, they brushed aside Wales last month, with \u2013 guess who \u2013 Eriksen scoring twice. Elsewhere tonight, two old foes \u2013 the Netherlands and Germany \u2013 will do battle in Amsterdam. Both have struggled to hit the dizzy heights, as they continue to rebuild after a difficult 12 months or so respectively."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
