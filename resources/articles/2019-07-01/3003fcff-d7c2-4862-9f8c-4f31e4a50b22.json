They say that Sir Kim Darroch\u2019s resignation last week was the latest episode in a \u201cwider culture of abusing civil servants which has been allowed to develop over the last few years\u201d. Darroch quit his post after confidential emails, in which he described Donald Trump\u2019s administration as \u201cclumsy and inept\u201d, were leaked to a Sunday newspaper. A police investigation is under way into the original leak, and last night further cables from Darroch were published. There are concerns that the leak was designed to have a chilling effect on the frank advice officials are willing to give ministers. In a letter to the Observer, the heads of the Prospect and FDA unions, which between them represent tens of thousands of Britain\u2019s civil servants, said Darroch\u2019s removal followed briefings against officials and \u201csustained attacks\u201d. \u201cNo group has done more to keep the country running than the civil service,\u201d the general secretaries write. \u201cAs a reward for this, civil servants have been subjected to sustained attacks from across the political spectrum. In recent months we have seen a malicious briefing campaign against individual civil servants involved in Brexit negotiations, attacks on Treasury officials when their forecasts warn of the dangers of no deal and the disgraceful attempt to blame civil servants for the national security leak involving Huawei. The culmination of this has been the disgraceful and unprecedented treatment of Sir Kim Darroch this week. This episode is part of a wider culture of abusing civil servants which has been allowed to develop over the last few years.\u201d Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the former foreign secretary, targets Boris Johnson for refusing to back Darroch in the face of Trump\u2019s criticisms and calls on Theresa May to appoint the next ambassador. \u201cThat choice should be made swiftly by the prime minister in consultation with the two candidates to succeed her,\u201d he writes in the Observer. \u201cDavid Cameron appointed the new British ambassador to Paris a few days before he resigned, with minimal consultation. There is no reason why Theresa May, consulting with Hunt and Johnson, cannot choose a successor in the next two weeks.\u201d Three former cabinet secretaries \u2013 Lord O\u2019Donnell, Lord Butler and Lord Armstrong \u2013 have added their voices to the growing chorus of concern. Butler said it would be \u201can act of self-harm to compromise our non-political civil service\u201d, while Armstrong said the principles of political impartiality had given the UK \u201cone of the least corrupt and most dependable public services in the world\u201d. He added: \u201cThey are not an outmoded relic of former times; they are a necessary condition of good government.\u201d O\u2019Donnell said: \u201cOne of the reasons our civil service is officially rated the best in the world is adherence to the values of objectivity, integrity, honesty and impartiality. Politicians will get the best out of the civil service if they encourage honest, robust advice and in return show respect for their commitment to honesty and impartiality. This applies to home civil servants and our diplomats.\u201d Sir Nigel Sheinwald, one of Darroch\u2019s predecessors as the UK ambassador in Washington, said the leak of emails could have a wider impact on the advice officials are willing to give. \u201cKim Darroch may have been the immediate target of the leak, but I suspect whoever was behind it has in mind a wider target of our system of public service and wanted to influence the way the next government handled the civil service, and was perhaps trying to influence the succession of Kim Darroch. This undermining of the public service has been going on for years and is clearly going to be a fundamental problem in the period ahead.\u201d Lord Ricketts, the former chief civil servant in the Foreign Office, said Whitehall had been \u201cbadly let down\u201d in the wake of the \u201cBrexit tornado [that] has ripped through British politics\u201d. \u201cCivil servants worked heroically to help a dysfunctional cabinet shape and deliver an agreement with the EU,\u201d he said. \u201cSir Ivan Rogers [the former UK ambassador to the EU] and Oliver Robbins both faced sustained political attacks on their integrity with precious little support from ministers. Now Sir Kim Darroch has been taken out by an act of partisan vandalism, presumably in the hope of replacing him with a political appointee more to Brexiters\u2019 taste. This corrosive environment is doing real damage to an organisation that has served Britain well for over a century.\u201d Lord Jay, a former ambassador to Paris who oversees the Lords EU select committee, said: \u201cCivil servants and diplomats must be able to offer advice and to report the views of others knowing their confidence will be respected. Ministers of course decide policy, but policy will be less well based and the quality of governance will suffer \u2013 from which we will all be the losers \u2013 if civil servants and diplomats are or feel muzzled.\u201d On Saturday night further cables emerged in which Darroch described Trump\u2019s decision in 2018 to abandon the Iran nuclear deal. President Obama had hailed the deal as a \u201chistoric understanding\u201d in 2015, when Iran had agreed to reduce its uranium stockpile and allow inspections of its nuclear facilities, in exchange for the lifting of US and EU sanctions. The memo from Darroch to Boris Johnson was written the day after the then foreign secretary had flown to Washington on 7 May 2018 to try to save the deal \u2013 unsuccessfully. Darroch praised Johnson for obtaining \u201cexceptional access\u201d, meeting US secretary of state Mike Pompeo, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John Bolton, his chief of staff, John Kelly, as well as Ivanka Trump and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner. \u201cThe outcome illustrated the paradox of this White House: you got exceptional access, seeing everyone short of the president; but on the substance, the administration is set upon an act of diplomatic vandalism, seemingly for ideological and personality reasons \u2013 it was Obama\u2019s deal,\u201d Darroch\u2019s memo said, according to the Mail on Sunday. \u201cMoreover, they can\u2019t articulate any \u2018day-after\u2019 strategy; and contacts with State Department this morning suggest no sort of plan for reaching out to partners and allies, whether in Europe or the region.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
