But will they be fair?", "bodyText": "As the dust begins to settle following weeks of upheaval in Bolivia, fresh elections are being promised in the new year by the self-appointed interim president, Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez. They offer a glimmer of hope for the restoration of the country\u2019s badly battered democracy \u2013 but only if they are free and fair. Meanwhile, her possible successors are beginning to jockey for position. Carlos Mesa, Evo Morales\u2019 chief rival in the 20 October elections, has announced he is running, while Morales\u2019 party Movement for Socialism (Mas) has said it will put forward \u201cyoung candidates\u201d in the place of the former president. Mesa\u2019s opposition on the right will be an upstart contender who only burst on to Bolivia\u2019s national scene in the past month. Luis Camacho is the president of the powerful civic organisation in the city of Santa Cruz, Bolivia\u2019s \u201ceconomic powerhouse\u201d. He emerged as a key player in the deposition of Morales and the subsequent installation of \u00c1\u00f1ez. Camacho is an ardent Roman Catholic conservative who openly bribed the police to mutiny against the Morales government, with promises of increased retirement pay. In doing so, he pushed aside both Mesa and the Organization of American States, which urged a democratic transition that would have allowed Morales to complete his term. Instead, Camacho and his followers forced Morales\u2019 immediate resignation. Widespread protests rocked the country for 10 days after \u00c1\u00f1ez\u2019s takeover. Several cities faced shortages of food and gas because of the many roadblocks. \u201cWe think her government will bring back the racism we suffered in the past,\u201d said an indigenous demonstrator who didn\u2019t want his name used. \u201cWe denounce the coup she has carried out without any authority whatsoever.\u201d On 15 November, the police and military opened fire on indigenous protesters outside Bolivia\u2019s fourth largest city, Cochabamba, killing nine and wounding more than 120. \u201cWe were marching peacefully and they began shooting off tear gas and firing on us,\u201d a crying woman told the Andean Information Network. \u201cThey treated us like animals.\u201d Four days later, in El Alto, police and military opened fire again on indigenous demonstrators, leaving eight dead and more than 30 wounded. An uneasy equilibrium returned last week, following these violent showdowns between the police \u2013 accompanied by the army \u2013 and pro-Morales protesters. But how long can this reprieve last, and is \u00c1\u00f1ez the right person to lead the country through this transition period, and ensure a return to some form of stability? \u00c1\u00f1ez\u2019s government initially behaved as if it had a mandate to transform the country and wreak revenge on those who supported the Morales administration. She was sworn into office holding a Bible, in a country that is constitutionally secular. \u00c1\u00f1ez has also been accused of publishing racist tweets against Bolivia\u2019s indigenous majority. The tone she set has been reflected in a resurgence of Bolivia\u2019s deep-seated racism, something that had eased under the 14 years Morales \u2013 Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous president \u2013 was in power. In response to his government\u2019s promotion of the indigenous wiphala flag, police mutinying against Morales ripped the wiphala off their uniforms. Racist graffiti, such as \u201cEvo, shitty Indian\u201d, in a country where Indian is still a pejorative term, appeared on city walls. Among \u00c1\u00f1ez\u2019s first moves were recognising Juan Guiad\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s president and throwing out of the country Cuban doctors who were working in impoverished, remote areas. Not long afterwards she exempted the military from any consequences from deploying force against demonstrators, and then provided it with an additional $35m in funding. But \u00c1\u00f1ez\u2019s government has recently backed down from its initial aggressive stance, and negotiations with the former government\u2019s legislators have resulted in a law authorising new elections within 120 days. An agreement has also been reached with social movement organisations opposed to \u00c1\u00f1ez. This has led to the lifting of over 90 blockades that have paralysed the country, in exchange for the withdrawal of the military from non-strategic locations, and the revocation of a law granting the military impunity for its actions against protesters. These steps signal some hope that the government is moving closer towards acting as a true transition government, although faith in the promise of fair elections remains thin. \u201cShould we support the new elections?\u201d an El Alto-based Mas supporter asked me. \u201cWith all that they have done to us, can we trust that they will respect our vote?\u201d The international community has committed extra assistance in conducting and monitoring the results of the new elections. Mas remains the single largest political force in the country, but its opponents are getting organised. As head of the transition government, \u00c1\u00f1ez is unable to run herself, but is expected to support Camacho, who announced last week that he intends to run as the leader of a united opposition, with his Potos\u00ed equivalent Marco Pumari at his side. This move to consolidate opposition to Mas, by a right wing that has not respected Bolivians\u2019 human rights, feeds uncertainty over the possibility of peaceful and fair elections. The key question remains: if Mas were to win, would the Bolivian right accept the results? \u2022 Linda Farthing is a journalist and researcher who has co-authored three books on Bolivia"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
