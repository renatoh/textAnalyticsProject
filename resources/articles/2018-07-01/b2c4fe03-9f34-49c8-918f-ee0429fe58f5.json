Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) found that nearly one in five crimes reported to Lincolnshire police were undocumented, potentially leaving some victims shut out from support services. The issue was \u201cof very great concern\u201d, the inspector of constabulary, Zo\u00eb Billingham, said. \u201cAlthough safeguarding measures were in place for many of the victims of crimes, there was little evidence of investigations being undertaken where the crime had not made it on to the books. This is particularly true for cases of domestic abuse. \u201cThe importance of correctly recording crime cannot be overlooked, or simply passed off as a bureaucratic measure. If a force does not correctly record crime, it cannot properly understand the demand on its services, nor provide support to those who need it most.\u201d Victims can only access certain support services when a crime is recorded and a lack of accurate statistics can leave senior officers with insufficient information when allocating resources. The watchdog examined records from the period 1 June to 30 November 2017 and estimated that about 9,400 reported crimes were not recorded per year \u2013 more than 18% of the total reported to Lincolnshire police. The report said a \u201clarge proportion of common assaults and malicious communication offences and a small number of more serious crimes, including sexual offences, grievous bodily harm and rape\u201d, were not recorded. Of particular concern was violent crime, where only 72.7% of reported incidents were recorded, with some crimes of grievous bodily harm and wounding where victims were badly injured not being properly documented. \u201cThis means that on too many occasions, the force is failing victims of crime,\u201d the watchdog said. Lincolnshire police\u2019s deputy chief constable, Craig Naylor, said measures had been put in place to improve recording and insisted the force\u2019s \u201cservice has not slipped\u201d. He said: \u201cWe are deeply disappointed by this report and absolutely committed to ensuring we resolve the problem quickly and effectively. We have made mistakes and we will not shirk from accepting and correcting them.\u201d Naylor added: \u201cThere are no \u2018missed\u2019 victims or offenders \u2013 what we have missed is the correct procedure for recording them.\u201d A force spokeswoman said many of the cases in question were ongoing inquiries where previous, historical incidents had not been correctly recorded \u2013 for example, if a victim of domestic violence reports crimes stretching back years. In a separate report, Humberside police were graded as \u201crequires improvement\u201d for recording reported crime. They were estimated to have failed to record 14.3% of the total crimes reported to the force per year. These included sexual offences, public order and violence offences."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
