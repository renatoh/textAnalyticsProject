Stewart, the comedian and former host of The Daily Show, has been a forceful proponent of legislation providing federal funding for medical treatment for survivors of the 9/11 terror attacks. Stewart testified before the House judiciary committee on Tuesday alongside first responders and victims, but only a handful of lawmakers appeared at the hearing, prompting a visibly angry Stewart to condemn their treatment of survivors. \u201cAs I sit here today, I can\u2019t help but think what an incredible metaphor this room is for the entire process that getting healthcare and benefits for 9/11 first responders has come to,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cBehind me, a filled room of 9/11 first responders and in front of me a nearly empty Congress.\u201d \u201cShameful,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an embarrassment to the country and it is a stain on this institution. You should be ashamed of yourselves, for those that aren\u2019t here, but you won\u2019t be. Because accountability doesn\u2019t appear to be something that occurs in this chamber.\u201d Earlier this year, the US government slashed payments by more than half to those who were sick and dying from the toxins released during the attacks after US officials said the 9/11 victims compensation fund was running out of money. Those who developed health issues or did not discover illnesses until a later stage saw even larger reductions in payouts for health benefits. More than 20,000 individuals have suffered or died from cancer, breathing problems and other ailments because of the trauma inflicted on 9/11. Stewart told lawmakers it took only five seconds for first responders in New York to arrive at the scene of the terrorist attacks and that hundreds \u201cdied in an instant\u201d. \u201cThere is not a person here, there is not an empty chair on that stage, that didn\u2019t tweet out \u2018never forget the heroes of 9/11\u2019,\u201d he said, quoting how members of Congress annually mark that day. \u201cNever forget their bravery, never forget what they did, what they gave to this country.\u201d Drawing attention once more to the lack of urgency among lawmakers on Capitol Hill, Stewart said: \u201cIt would be one thing if their callous indifference and rank hypocrisy were benign, but it\u2019s not. \u201cYour indifference cost these men and women their most valuable commodity \u2014 time. It\u2019s the one thing they\u2019re running out of \u2026 This hearing should be flipped. These men and women should be up on that stage, and Congress should be down here answering their questions as to why this is so hard and takes so damn long.\u201d Stewart, who often grew emotional in his remarks, has repeatedly traveled to Washington with 9/11 victims and first responders to lobby for legislation to codify the health benefits into law. Congress authorized $7.3bn in 2015 to cover claims through the end of 2020, but funds have quickly been depleted across 20,000 people enrolled in the program. Data released by the 9/11 fund in January showed a 235% surge in death claims compared with the end of 2015. The number of individuals suffering from cancer and filing eligible claims has also ballooned. Stewart also took aim at those who dismiss 9/11 funding as a \u201cNew York issue\u201d. \u201cAl-Qaida didn\u2019t shout \u2018death to Tribeca,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey attacked America. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I sound angry and undiplomatic, but I am angry and you should be too,\u201d added Stewart, who received a standing ovation at the conclusion of his statement. \u201cThey responded in five seconds. They did their jobs [with] courage, grace, tenacity, humility. Eighteen years later, do yours.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
