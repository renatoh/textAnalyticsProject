Some have speculated that fireworks at nearby Taunton Rugby Club may have distracted drivers. Josie Gallimore, 60, whose cottage is near the accident scene, said she had surveyed the carnage with her husband from a nearby motorway bridge. \"It was about 11.30pm and there were helicopters and fire engines and a lot of noise,\" she said. \"We didn't stay long because it was too disturbing. You could hear the cries of the little ones trapped in their cars. They had to remain in their cars with their families and apparently some were there for up to three and a half hours. We walked back home afterwards and we could hear the sirens going until about 2am. There were helicopters as well. I didn't sleep last night. I couldn't.\" Neighbour Sylvia Ackland, 73, said: \"I heard a loud bang and saw black smoke in the sky but thought that it was fireworks. My daughter was out at the rugby club and saw something of what was going on. She said it was horrific. There were children screaming but they could not get out.\" She said in addition to the rugby club's firework display there was also a large bonfire in a nearby field. Pete Martin, of nearby Creech St Michael, walked to the Hyde Lane bridge with his wife yesterday morning to view the crash scene. Like many others he had initially believed the noise, smoke and flashing lights in the sky had been part of a firework display. He said that while it was not possible to say the club's firework display contributed to the accident, it would have been a distraction to drivers. \"We heard this bang and thought that it was fireworks going off but now we do not know,\" he said. \"We just assumed that it was coming from Taunton Rugby Club because of the time in the evening. You would certainly have been able to see it from the motorway.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
