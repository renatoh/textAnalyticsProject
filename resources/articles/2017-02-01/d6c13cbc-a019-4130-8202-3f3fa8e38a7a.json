Chelsea\u2019s Antonio Conte and the erstwhile Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew have been among the spectators in Bagshot this week and on Friday it was the turn of Alastair Cook. Should Eddie Jones\u2019s team rack up a cricket score at Twickenham, their inspiration will not be hard to pinpoint. Cook is also a keen rugby supporter who follows Northampton Saints and once persuaded England\u2019s oval-ball captain, Dylan Hartley, to pop down and chat with some regulars in his local pub. The pair duly struck up a friendship and Jones, a fervent cricket fan, was equally delighted to welcome the prolific opening batsman into England\u2019s Bagshot camp for a convivial lunch with his squad. In common with Conte and Pardew, Cook will have instantly recognised the relaxed, upbeat vibe of a consistent winning team with no desire to rest on their laurels. During last week\u2019s fallow week in London a conscious decision was made to ratchet up the intensity of their preparations and Jones\u2019s starting XV reinforces the sense of a team determined to raise the bar again on Sunday. Into the run-on team have come the centre Ben Te\u2019o, winger Jonny May, scrum-half Danny Care and flanker James Haskell, with Jack Nowell, Ben Youngs and Jack Clifford moving to the bench and Jonathan Joseph missing out altogether. Rather than mess with the 10-12 axis of George Ford and Owen Farrell, however, Te\u2019o will wear 13 with Elliot Daly again on the wing and Henry Slade held back for the final stages when Daly will probably shift across to full-back. For students of England\u2019s backline permutations under Jones it helps to understand the Australian is deliberately seeking to identify three players in each specialist position prior to the 2019 Rugby World Cup. At 13 the favoured trio are currently Joseph, Daly and Te\u2019o while, as things stand, Farrell, Te\u2019o and Slade are the leading alternatives at 12. Nowell may also enter the outside centre reckoning at a later date but, against the Azzurri, Jones is looking for express pace on the wide outside and to test a Farrell-Te\u2019o centre combination that, mentally and physically, will take few prisoners. Any temptation, on the occasion of Farrell\u2019s 50th cap, to throw the Saracen the 10 jersey and the captain\u2019s armband, or either of them, has been resisted, although it will surely happen one day. Having used the word \u201cFinishers\u201d rather than \u201cReplacements\u201d on the official Rugby Football Union teamsheet, Jones was also particularly keen to expand on his penchant for utilising particular players at specific moments in a contest. The head coach does not see a rugby match as having four quarters but, rather, three contrasting segments \u2013 a start, a middle and an end. \u201cPhysiologically, psychologically and tactically they are different,\u201d said Jones. \u201cSome players have attributes that are much better suited to the first part of the game. The requirement for us is to see how we get a maximum 80 minutes out of each position and keep the opposition under so much pressure they can\u2019t get away from us.\u201d The last bit is particularly ominous for Italy, who also have the misfortune of running into a home team fresh from a fortnight of bespoke preparation. Avoiding the undignified descent suffered by Leicester this season has been another motivation. \u201cThe message to us was you don\u2019t get ruthless after a bad loss \u2013 you get ruthless while you\u2019re winning,\u201d stressed Hartley. \u201cOur message was, \u2018Let\u2019s get ruthless now, let\u2019s not take our foot off the gas and let\u2019s train harder because who else will be training as hard as us?\u2019\u201d It was equally instructive to hear the England captain reveal Jones took him aside to suggest the hooker might yet keep the role for longer than some imagine. As a former hooker himself, the Australian told him his prime years could still be ahead of him if he manages to keep his deputy Jamie George at bay. \u201cI\u2019ve had a conversation with Eddie and he\u2019s made it very clear what I can achieve within the team,\u201d said Hartley. Given Jones hauled Hartley off after 46 minutes in Cardiff, there is clearly some cunning psychology going on here, although the head coach \u2013 \u201cDylan can\u2019t play until he is 50\u201d \u2013 accepts that Hartley will never equal Cook\u2019s haul of 140 Tests. As for George, the long wait for a Six Nations start is a source of increasing impatience. \u201cI\u2019d be disappointed if he wasn\u2019t disappointed,\u201d said Jones with a shrug. \u201cIn fact, if he wasn\u2019t disappointed he wouldn\u2019t be in the squad. There will be a time when Jamie gets the spot but at the moment Dylan is our captain and the first pick on the teamsheet.\u201d Pausing only to add that he had ordered his winger May to shave on Thursday evening \u2013 \u201cHe had a thick beard and it made him look slow ... he\u2019s quick now\u201d \u2013 Jones is less interested in the volume of points his side amass than the overall control they exert on an Italian side who are still without a win at Twickenham: \u201cWe want to play with real pressure and intent and every time Italy have the ball we want them to feel they don\u2019t want it. \u201cWhen I announced the squad to the players I said to them: \u2018There will be guys left out of this squad that will be good enough to play for the Lions.\u2019 That\u2019s how strong it is.\u201d And, as a Chelsea fan, would Jones fancy taking over if Conte ever leaves Stamford Bridge ? \u201cI\u2019d love to have a go but I couldn\u2019t because I don\u2019t know much about football.\u201d Cue an instant retort from one mischievous wag: \u201cThat never stopped Clive Woodward.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
