The Chelsea winger was put clear by Charlton's Claus Jensen before shooting low past the goalkeeper. Denmark, who now have 10 points and lead the Norwegians by virtue of a superior head-to-head record, next play in Luxembourg on Wednesday. \"Obviously we need three points then but the pressure is on Norway,\" said Morten Olsen, the Danish coach Romania , who visit Norway that same evening, beat Bosnia 2-0 to move into third place on nine points. The shock of the weekend came in Zaragoza where Greece inflicted a first home qualifier defeat on Spain , the Group Six leaders, since France beat them 2-1 in October 1991. Stelios Giannakopoulos got the goal with a 20-yard drive three minutes before half-time of a match the hosts dominated, the more so after Greece were reduced to 10 men in the 82nd minute. Ukraine grabbed a 4-3 injury-time win over Armenia , who led twice, leaving the group wide open with the Ukrainians and Greece, who meet in Athens on Wednesday, a point behind Spain, who face Northern Ireland. \"Now it is vital to go to Belfast and get a good win,\" said Inaki Saez after his first defeat as the Spanish coach. The match between the top two in Group Ten finished 2-2 in Basle but only after Russia fought back from 2-0 down against Switzerland . The unbeaten Swiss stay top, on nine points, ahead of Russia and Ireland, both with seven. Austria , joint hosts of Euro 2008 with the Swiss, went down 1-0 in Moldova - who had lost all four or their Group Three qualifiers - and now look out of it on six points, four behind the Czechs and seven behind Holland , who won 2-0 in Belarus where Patrick Kluivert became the Dutch all-time leading scorer with 38, one more than Dennis Bergkamp."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
