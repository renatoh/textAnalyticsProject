A serious challenge to his ambitions is likely to come from Sir Michael Stoute's King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes winner Conduit, who is set to bid for back-to-back to victories in the valuable Grade One event. Although he has yet to race at 1m 4f, the distance of the Breeders' Cup Turf, Gio Ponti's trainer, Chris Clement, feels his star colt could cope with the longer trip, judging by how stoutly he stayed on to land yesterday's Million. Gio Ponti hit the front two furlongs out under Ramon Dominguez to secure a fourth successive Grade One victory. Remarkably, the Walter Swinburn-trained Stotsfold was produced by Adam Kirby with a powerful challenge on turning for home. But after seeming as if his momentum might carry him all the way to a surprise success for Britain, the 28-1 shot was unable to catch Gio Ponti and was caught himself for second on the line by the fast-finishing Just As Well, with the Luca Cumani-trained Cima De Triomphe back in fourth of the eight runners. Nearer to home, racing took place at Leicester in front of a large Sunday crowd after the meeting had survived an early-morning inspection. In the day's feature race, a \u00a320,000 handicap over seven furlongs, John Dunlop's Imaam put his best foot forward and made all for a tenacious success from the runner-up, Rafta, who stayed on best of the rest in a valiant attempt to extend her winning sequence to five."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
