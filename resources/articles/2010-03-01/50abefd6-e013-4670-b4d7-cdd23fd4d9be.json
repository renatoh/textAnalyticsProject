Sources close to the talks said that the discussions, although in their early stages, were serious in their intent. Jim O'Neill, chief economist at the bank Goldman Sachs and a lifelong United fan, is a key figure in the group, which is made up largely of United fans, and is confident of being able to raise the \u00a31bn-plus required. \u2022 The key figures in the Red Knights consortium \u2022 David Conn: Red Knights give fans hope of life after Glazers \u2022 Manchester United fall behind Barcelona on football rich list O'Neill today met other powerful City figures interested in exploring the possibility of bidding for the club, which is carrying debts of \u00a3716m if the high interest hedge fund loans secured by the Glazers on their stake in United are added to the \u00a3504m bond raised in January. O'Neill was an outspoken critic of the bond issue despite his investment bank being one of seven underwriting the issue and sharing in \u00a315m in fees. \"There's too much leverage going on with Manchester United,\" he said in January. \"It's not a good thing. I'm not a buyer of the bond.\" Others believed to be at today's meeting in London included Mike Rawlinson, a partner at the City law firm Freshfields, who advised United on their takeover by the Glazers in 2005. Further City figures, including Paul Marshall, a partner at the hedge fund Marshall Wace, and Keith Harris, a stockbroker who has been involved in several football takeovers, are supporting the Red Knights. Richard Hytner, the deputy chairman of the global advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, is also involved along with other influential figures from other business sectors. Harris, a United supporter, last week called on supporters backing the anti-Glazer green and gold protests \u2013 the colours first worn by United \u2013 to begin boycotting the club and said that any takeover would hand fans a \"golden share\" giving them a decisive say in its future. The talks grew out of earlier attempts by United fans to engage wealthy fans in the possibility of a buy-out scheme that would slowly morph into a collective ownership model. But the discussions have become more serious after the full extent of the Glazers' borrowings, and the amount they intend to take out of the club over the next seven years to pay down their own high interest loans, has become clear. The 322-page prospectus that was issued to encourage take-up of the bond issue revealed that the Glazers could potentially take out almost \u00a3130m in cash from the club next year alone. That is in addition to the straightforward payment of interest (yield) on the \u00a3504m bond of around \u00a345m. That will bring the total taken out of United to service the Glazers' borrowings, which were loaded on to the club after the family bought it, to \u00a3172m next year alone. Although the successful bond issue laid bare their business model and the money that would flow out of the club rather than being invested in players and facilities, it has in many ways strengthened the Glazers' hand. Their spokesman was tonight unequivocal: \"Manchester United is not for a sale. It's business as usual.\" The bond was twice over-subscribed but the risk attached to the bonds by the market has increased since they were issued. Andy Green, an investment professional and United supporter who wrote a challenging open letter to United's chief executive, David Gill, under his blogging name Andersred, told the Guardian last week: \"There is a very serious process going on in the City, with investors looking at a structure in which fans can develop as significant a stake as possible. Key will be persuading the Glazers to sell.\" United sources believe the news may have been leaked for maximum impact. Figures released tomorrow by Deloitte will show that United have been overtaken by Barcelona in the list of the world's biggest revenue generators, slipping to third. Gill will on Wednesday give his first public defence of the refinancing at the Soccerex conference in Manchester. In his only interview since the bond was issued, he has backed the Glazers to the hilt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
