England's leading sides have gained the backing of French and Italian clubs in their attempt to be given more influence over the cup, especially on the commercial side, but they will need the support of the Rugby Football Union at today's meeting of the European Rugby Cup board in Dublin and that is unlikely to be granted. The RFU yesterday refused to say what position it would take, but in the past it has said that it is only prepared to consider the issue as part of a quid pro quo package for the management of elite players which includes more release days for international training sessions, off-season rest periods and a reduction in the maximum number of appearances permitted in a calendar year. Premier Rugby, which represents the clubs, insists that the proposed change to the running of European Rugby Cup should be considered in isolation without the issue of player release, not least because time is pressing, with the current agreement for the competition running out at the end of the season. The Italian and French unions have sided with their clubs and agreed that European Rugby Cup's shareholding should be changed. At the moment, the four home unions and France each hold 19% of the shares with the Italian federation owning the remaining five. Premier Rugby wants half of the RFU's shares and equal voting rights on the European Rugby Cup board with the union, which currently has three of England's five votes and the clubs the other two. The clubs want the split to be 2\u00bd-2\u00bd. It has said that if the proposals are thrown out, the English clubs will consider withdrawing from the Heineken Cup and the European Challenge Cup. The English clubs pulled out of Europe in the 1998-99 season, in protest at the way the two tournaments were run, but returned after 12 months and signed the eight-year Paris Accord, which bound all the participants together. That ends in May and European Rugby Cup is looking to replace it with a five-year agreement which rolls on every year, with a two-year notice period for anyone who wants to withdraw. Premier Rugby believes the Heineken Cup is not maximising its commercial potential: Premiership clubs receive an average of \u00a3400,000 for taking part, compared to \u00a3625,000 for appearing in the EDF Energy Cup. \"We are not drawing up plans to pull out of Europe, but there will come a time if we are unable to make a breakthrough when we have to look at potential alternatives,\" said the Premier Rugby chief executive, Mark McCafferty, who will be at today's meeting. \"All we are looking for is a sensible agreement to take us into 2007-08 and beyond. It would be very disappointing if we did not make a breakthrough.\" Today's meeting may be a stepping stone rather than the day when a final decision is made, but time is of the essence with competitions which determine Heineken Cup qualification for next season already under way. \"We are in discussions with the RFU about a number of issues relating to England players, but there is no pressing need for a resolution because current agreements last until at least after next year's World Cup,\" McCafferty added. Time is short as far as the Heineken Cup is concerned and we hope that the RFU considers the issue in its own right.\" McCafferty said another reason for reaching agreement quickly was to sort out the future of the unloved, unsponsored and cash-draining Challenge Cup, which has come to be dominated by England. \"In soccer, the Champions League has come to overshadow the Uefa Cup and perhaps the time has come for us to run just one competition. That is an argument for another day, one I hope will involve the English clubs.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
