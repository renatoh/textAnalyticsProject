Work started more than 20 years ago on this documentary about a Peruvian Indian who was born without a nose and suffering from major facial deformities. The film charts the story of David's journey through more than 100 operations performed in Scotland and the US by his adoptive surgeon father, to his current life in California. The story first caught the attention in Britain through early documentaries made by the late Desmond Wilcox, to whom the new film is dedicated. Over the years, the tale has returned to our TV screens on a number of occasions. We saw the shy toddler with the piercing eyes become a boisterous Glasgow kid, then a teenager graduating from an American high school after he had emigrated to the US with his adoptive Scottish family. We met the thoughtful surgeon, Ian Jackson, who agonised over whether he had done the right thing by plucking this child from his homeland and submitting him to so many painful operations. Now, new footage has been shot and the hours of earlier documentaries cut into a single feature-length film by director Alex McCall. The filming was completed only last year, and the new version includes a scene of a reunion between David and the Swiss charity worker Martine Schopfer, who, as an idealistic 18-year-old, had impulsively grabbed the toddler from a Peruvian hospital and taken him to Dr Jackson. A commentary read by actor Dougray Scott has been added. So what was the end of the story? And what did the character whose operations and struggles were catalogued in such painful detail feel about it all? Sitting in a noisy coffee bar in Culver City, not far from LA airport, over Labor Day weekend, David Lopez Jackson - the Lopez is his original surname - is philosophical about the cause of his fame and the film itself. He has driven up from the apartment he shares with a friend in Long Beach and is casually dressed in black shirt and jeans with a diamond stud earring and a busy mobile by his side - very much the Californian. After studying art for four years in Detroit, he now works as a graphic designer and a club DJ. \"It brought back memories of when I was wee,\" he said of the film. \"It was like a personal journal. I thought it was beautifully made. I think, if you see it, you can understand what I have gone through and people in my situation have gone through. I hope it will open people's minds to how other people can be cruel or can be very generous, but also, if you have a strong family how you can achieve anything.\" The film does indeed tell of people at their best and worst. At one school in Spain, where he spent the early winters because he had to be away from cold weather to aid his recovery, he was made to eat his lunch facing the wall so that the other children did not have to look at him. But there are also many tales of the cheerful way in which he was welcomed when he arrived in Glasgow and later in Minnesota and Detroit, where his father's work took him. He is grateful for what has been done for him, both by his family and through the films made about him, describing Desmond Wilcox as \"a character, a really nice gentleman and Esther [Rantzen, his widow] is great, too\". But he is anxious not to be defined by his past, and his one objection to the film is the title. \"I do mind it, \" he says. \"I'm not really a boy any more - I'm 28. I really do want my own identity. I don't want to be known as 'the boy David' all my life. I want to be able to show people that I can do things for myself and be recognised for that.\" After the initial operations and childhood in Glasgow, he moved with his adoptive parents, three sisters and a brother to the US, where Dr Jackson now works at the Providence hospital in Detroit. His siblings are scattered across the US, from New York to Atlanta to Detroit, and the family meet up for Christmas holidays. In the film, much is made of the fact that, had he not been taken to Scotland, he would have ended up on the streets in Peru as a beggar. \"How do they know? Maybe I could have worked in a restaurant as a wash-person,\" he says. \"Maybe it would have ended my life early, I don't know. I've been lucky to have found people who have loved me and taken care of me, so I don't really think about that. \" He has brought with him copies of his paintings, some fine self-portraits, including one of himself arriving in Scotland in his Peruvian headgear, and there are also some handsome nudes. He is now anxious to make his own way, and although the graphic design firm he started last year with friends has had its problems, he has another string to his bow as a DJ in clubs in Long Beach, Orange County and in LA, where he plays a mix of 1980s music and rap. His ambition, he says, is to open his own Latin salsa club. Indeed, the large Latino community in California was the main reason for leaving Detroit and heading south: \"I want to be able to speak Spanish and be in the whole Latin environment. The other reason for coming to California was that I want to be in the entertainment industry, too.\" He returned to Peru three years ago, as part of the film, but eventually decided not to see his blood parents. \"There was so much going on, so much emotion, \" he says. \"It was a really big decision, but I just said no. I have to live with my life and I have to do what I have to do.\" He is used to being stared at. \"If I'm in a mall, there are always more people staring at me than if I am in the street,\" he says. \"On the beach, people stare at me - and that's fine, I really don't mind. I don't mind being different. People in California say they want to be different but they always end up being the same. At first, I was kind of timid, but now I may as well use it to my advantage. Sometimes, when I go to clubs, people move away from me - so at least there's a path to walk through.\" There may be a few more operations to go. \"It's up to me, I think I'll have maybe five more, just touch-up stuff. There have been more than 100. After you reach a certain point, you don't count. Pain doesn't bother me, it 's more the having no control over my body that really scared me, but I know I'm in the best hands. \" The film has already been shown in the US, but had a very brief run.\" In America, they don't want anything too serious. Over here, it's all about sex and looks and money. I don't mind being the way I am, I just wish more people could get an idea of who I am. I'm different - but I'm not.\" It may have taken more than 20 years to make, but the philosophy behind it is centuries old, as articulated by Shakespeare in the lines that act as its credo: \"In nature there's no blemish but the mind/None can be called deformed but the unkind.\" \u00b7 The Boy David is released on September 12."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
