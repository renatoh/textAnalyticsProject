Russell Hobby, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), will send out a rallying call to the country\u2019s school leaders at a conference this weekend, urging them to stand up against bad ideas. \u201cIt is possible to make a good idea fail and, frankly, it is possible to make bad ideas succeed,\u201d he will tell delegates to the NAHT\u2019s annual conference, in Liverpool on Sunday. \u201cYou\u2019ve proven that time and again in rescuing the government from its own mistakes. Perhaps you should stop doing that. It only encourages the crazy schemes when you find a way to make them work.\u201d Hobby will also use his speech to warn that innovative headteachers in the state school system are being \u201ctamed\u201d by an all-powerful inspection regime which is compromising creativity and creating a compliant profession. Speaking at a conference briefing on Friday, Hobby, whose union represents 29,500 school leaders across all phases of education, said: \u201cWe should be a lot stronger in saying, \u2018look you\u2019ve not given us enough time. This is not well thought through\u2019, and asking the government to go back to the drawing board.\u201d School leaders did not have to be \u201cobstructionist\u201d, he said, but should be sufficiently confident to stand up to government. \u201cIn the past we\u2019ve proposed an office of educational responsibility, which should cost up and evaluate different education schemes. \u201cIf a government isn\u2019t willing to do that, I think school leaders themselves should step up and say \u2018actually, you know what, we\u2019ve done the sums on this, it can\u2019t be implemented in time\u2019. He added: \u201cIf the government changes a league table measure, you don\u2019t have to jump and change your curriculum in response to that, you can carry on doing what you were going to do anyway. If school leaders want some level of autonomy, to a degree they\u2019ve got to practice it, not just ask for it.\u201d Hobby will also use his speech to raise concerns about the influence of Ofsted. \u201cLooking back on the last five years I think we will find that, far from delegating power and authority to school leaders, the secretary of state has in fact delegated power to the chief inspector of schools. \u201cSchools must now spend too long guessing what the inspector wants instead of thinking about what their pupils need,\u201d he will say. \u201cI have come to feel that one of the most pernicious aspects of our inspection regime is the \u2018outstanding\u2019 grade. \u201cWe have handed the definition of excellence to our regulator rather than owning it as profession. Excellence \u2013 to which all schools should aspire \u2013 is individual and subjective. It is not captured by a checklist or framework. \u201cWorse than this, the pursuit of someone else\u2019s definition of outstanding creates a compliant profession. It exerts a hold over those leaders who should be most self-confident and critical. \u201cThe outstanding grade tames the mavericks. I believe schools can and should be outstanding. I just don\u2019t think we should let a regulator define it.\u201d Headteacher and NAHT vice president Kim Johnson, speaking ahead of the conference, agreed that a fear of Ofsted was stifling the more creative school leaders. \u201cIt\u2019s about being a risk-taker isn\u2019t it, it\u2019s about being creative in your thinking about what you want to do and actually saying \u2018here\u2019s new ideas, let\u2019s put them into practice\u2019 but sometimes people are constrained because they think if they do that, Ofsted will say \u2018that was wrong\u2019\u201d. Hobby said headteachers in the independent sector, who are not under the same pressure from Ofsted and government, enjoy greater freedom than those in charge of state schools. \u201cYou still see plenty of heads who will speak out in the state system, but I think there should be more of them, and I think we would be stronger and more self-confident. \u201cIf you have led a school to achieve great things and you\u2019re achieving good academic results and a well-rounded education, you should be the kind of person that can speak out, and we should be able to listen to those heads and pay serious attention to what they say, because they have the credentials.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
