The Premier League believes that West Ham have severed all links to Tevez's agent, Kia Joorabchian, who owns the economic rights to the player, and if the club agree to terminate the remaining three years of the Argentina striker's contract - something he has requested personally - sanctions will be imposed. A Premier League spokesman said: \"We have made it clear to West Ham that we will take action against them if they agree to Tevez's request to terminate his contract.\" The league is unhappy at the prospect of Joorabchian being the main beneficiary of a deal with Old Trafford, after being given assurances this year that West Ham, who own the player's registration, had cut all ties with the businessman and his company, MSI. \"We are satisfied the agreement between West Ham and MSI no longer exists. Joorabchian says it does. The only way MSI can proceed is to sue West Ham for breach of contract,\" said the league spokesman. In a related issue, Joorabchian is prepared to hand over all the documentation relating to Tevez's contract at West Ham if tomorrow's high court ruling goes in favour of Sheffield United. The relegated club are pursuing legal action after the Premier League inquiry decided not to dock West Ham points for breaking two regulations in their signing of Tevez and his fellow Argentinian Javier Mascherano. Rafael Ben\u00edtez believes Yossi Benayoun can fill the gap in his squad vacated by Luis Garc\u00eda, who returned to Spain with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid this month. The Liverpool manager is today expected to confirm the arrival of Benayoun and Ryan Babel, who passed a medical yesterday as a prelude to his \u00a313m move from Ajax. Benayoun signed for \u00a35m and has agreed a four-year contract. \"It is true Benayoun and Garc\u00eda are similar,\" said Ben\u00edtez. \"Maybe Luis is a player who scores more goals and Benayoun tends to make more assists. Like Luis he is a clever player with a lot of game intelligence.\" Marlon Harewood is poised to sign for Birmingham City in a \u00a33.5m deal after passing a medical at St Andrew's yesterday, but the manager, Steve Bruce, looks certain to lose his striker DJ Campbell to Leicester City and the \u00a32.7m signing Rowan Vine is likely to move to Cardiff. Blackburn will face the Lithuanian side FK Vetra in the Intertoto Cup third round after Uefa yesterday expelled Legia Warsaw from the competition because of crowd trouble at the weekend. Lee McCulloch has signed for Rangers on a four-year contract after Wigan Athletic accepted a \u00a32.25m offer for the midfielder from the Scottish club."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
