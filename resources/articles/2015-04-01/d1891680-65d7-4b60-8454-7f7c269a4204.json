But that hasn\u2019t stopped the 2016 Republican presidential hopeful from sending multiple signed tweets directly commenting on foreign policy while overseas this week. Under questioning, the midwestern governor has made several gaffes when wading into the relatively uncharted waters of global affairs, comparing protesters in Wisconsin to members of the Islamic State and suggested he might support ground troops in Syria. On a trade visit to the UK in February, Walker declined not only talk about foreign policy but even to answer a question about his thoughts on evolution. On Sunday while in Germany, joining fellow potential Republican candidates in attacking Hillary Clinton following her announcement that she would run for president, Walker sent out a tweet attacking the former secretary of state as \u201cthe architect\u201d of what he called Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cfailed foreign policy\u201d. The next day, while still in Germany, Walker urged the Obama administration to change longstanding policy and arm the Ukrainian government in its fight against Russian-backed separatists. On Thursday, Walker\u2019s wife, who joined him overseas, signed a tweet from the governor\u2019s account to his 117,000 followers, attacking Clinton\u2019s foreign policy \u201creset\u201d with Russia. In an interview published Friday ahead of the European tour, Walker told the Associated Press: \u201cI\u2019m old school. I believe in that tradition when you\u2019re on foreign soil you shouldn\u2019t be talking about foreign affairs.\u201d Longstanding international etiquette for US politicians travelling overseas tends to cover avoiding direct criticism of current US foreign policy and foreign policymakers, not any discussion of international affairs in general. During Walker\u2019s February stop in London, he declined to answer repeated questions about foreign policy: \u201cFor me, commenting on foreign policy or economic policy in a country where you\u2019re a visitor is not the polite thing.\u201d Both that trip to the UK and Walker\u2019s current visit to Europe were trade missions carried out in his role as Wisconsin governor; the social media posts came from a Twitter account affiliated with his political committee. In response to an inquiry from the Guardian, a Walker aide pointed out that the Wisconsin governor \u201cdidn\u2019t criticize the president\u201d. Asked whether the statement attributed to the governor about Clinton\u2019s perceived continuation of \u201cObama\u2019s failed foreign policy\u201d could be construed as criticism, the Walker aide, who asked to remain anonymous, was more straightforward: \u201cClearly the intent of that tweet was aimed at Hillary Clinton\u2019s foreign policy decisions.\u201d During her first week on the campaign trail, Clinton has touted her tenure as secretary of state as a strength, even as Republicans have been busy using it as an early line of attack."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
