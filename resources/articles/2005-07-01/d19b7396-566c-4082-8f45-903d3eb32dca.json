The Arsenal defender is still plagued by the calf injury that ruled him out of the end of last season and prevented him being selected for the FA Cup final. He has been unable to train let alone play in either of Arsenal's pre-season games in Austria. \"It is difficult for him to miss pre-season because he had trouble last year as well,\" the manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger said. \"He was never completely fit last season and for me it is a big worry because it means he cannot have a normal preparation. Hopefully he will be able to start working on his fitness again next week. But because Sol has not played for so long it is impossible that he will be able to start the season.\" Wenger has contradicted reports that the 30-year-old might have been offered to Newcastle as part of a deal for Jermaine Jenas. \"I am absolutely not willing to sell Sol,\" he said. \"He is a part of my plans. He is a great player and we want him to come back and fight to play.\" Arsenal were quickly into their stride in their second match on tour yesterday and went on to beat Ritzing 5-2. Dennis Bergkamp opened the scoring after 10 minutes when he was presented with an easy finish from Thierry Henry's defence-splitting pass. Henry then scored himself with a far-post header and it was 3-0 just after the half-hour when Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes converted a penalty. Ritzing, who play in the regional third division of the Austrian system, pulled a goal back before half-time and then gave Arsenal a shock when Alfred Schiffer skipped past Alex Song, Philippe Senderos and Pascal Cygan before firing past Vito Mannone, a recent signing from Atalanta. Alexander Hleb restored Arsenal's two-goal margin 10 minutes from the end as he avoided a couple of challenges before rounding the goalkeeper to score. Seb Larsson finished things off with a powerful header from Robert Pires's corner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
