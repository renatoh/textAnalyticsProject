Nonetheless, six years ago he took out a \u00a365-a-month mortgage payment protection policy with his lender, HSBC, in case he should ever be unable to work, and therefore make his repayments. Last summer he was glad of his foresight. His wife developed a brain tumour and became suicidal, and the stress of looking after her affected Butler's health. Then he lost the use of his right arm and knee due to bone and cartilage erosion and his GP told him that he would never be able to work or drive again. However, HSBC decided that he was not sufficiently incapacitated and refused to pay out. \"Claimants have to meet three out of 11 'conditions' to qualify and HSBC insists that Clive only meets two,\" says his sister-in-law, Jackie Seaton, who turned to the Guardian in desperation. \"One condition states that the claimant must be unable to climb 12 steps unaided. The HSBC assessor met Clive in his step-free bungalow, yet he still decided that Clive failed the criteria.\" The family appealed and sent letters from Butler's GP confirming his incapacity, but HSBC remained unmoved and the Butlers are now relying on food and cash hand-outs from their family. \"When Clive was sold the policy he was not told of the near impossibility of meeting the highly artificial criteria,\" says Seaton. \"By any reasonable standards he has fulfilled nearly all of them.\" Four days after I contact HSBC's press office the bank has an attack of conscience. \"After reviewing the situation again, we feel that the decision was a strict interpretation of the terms of the policy and did not reflect the 'spirit' of it and Mr Butler's personal circumstances,\" says a spokeswoman, who adds that he now fulfils the necessary criteria following a knee replacement. Butler is to receive the relevant payments backdated."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
