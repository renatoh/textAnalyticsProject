For Burgon, Gresham was among the most illustrious ancestors \u201cof which our metropolis can boast\u201d \u2013 not just owing to \u201cthe skill with which he contrived to control the exchange with foreign countries\u201d, thereby laying \u201cthe foundations of England\u2019s commercial greatness\u201d, but also because his qualities spoke of an upstanding friend, associate, husband, father. When Gresham died, he deserved to be remembered as a \u201ctrue patriot, beloved in private life and honoured in his public station\u201d. Burgon\u2019s remarks are emblematic of the 19th-century view of Gresham as an honourable and self-made man: Queen Victoria\u2019s recorder considered him an \u201ceminent citizen and chief benefactor of his kind\u201d. And such depictions are not without merit. But as the historian John Guy argues in this assiduously researched new account of Gresham\u2019s life: \u201cSomething subtler is needed.\u201d Accordingly, Guy has consulted several \u201clarge caches of often entirely virgin sources\u201d in order to offer a reassessment of Gresham\u2019s professional undertakings and \u201ca fuller investigation of Gresham\u2019s private life than anything attempted before\u201d. It is an enterprise from which he does not emerge well. Far from being the self-made man of 19th-century hagiography, Gresham was born to Audrey Lynne and the wealthy and well-connected merchant Sir Richard Gresham at Cheapside in (we think) 1519. Thereafter he was not, as certain Victorian scholars suggested, abandoned in a field only to be discovered by a passerby whose attention was roused by the chirping of a grasshopper, but raised by his father and stepmother, Isabel Worsopp, who entered the family home following the death of his mother in 1522. He received his education first at the Mercers\u2019 Company \u201calphabet\u201d school, followed by St Paul\u2019s and Gonville Hall, Cambridge, where he matriculated at the age of 11. With his formal education complete, Gresham was introduced by his father to the tenebrous financial secrets of international exchange. He would go on, all the while beetling between the financial centres of London and Antwerp, to make a living initially in the employ of the Mercers\u2019 Company, before becoming government banker to Edward VI, Mary I and Elizabeth I. By the close of his service, he had transformed contemporary understanding of royal power and economics by establishing more convincingly than any of his contemporaries the principle that bankers and money markets could hold monarchs to ransom, and secured a reputation as the great \u2013 and often greatly resented \u2013 fiscal wizard of the age. While addressing himself to these activities, Gresham founded (between 1565 and 1571) the Royal Exchange and dedicated himself to living as disreputable a life as possible. In addition to setting up an unlicensed forge and advocating the death penalty as a way to enforce state-controlled trading monopolies, he was controlling, vain, infatuated by money, and a prodigy of deception, \u201cblatant cronyism\u201d, \u201cbrute force\u201d and \u201cblackmail\u201d. \u201cRuthless, obsessive\u201d and \u201cseemingly loveless\u201d, he repeatedly stiffed family members in financial matters, twice betrayed his wife (whom he married for money) by sleeping with other women, and at his death, for all his fabled wealth, left his widow to deal with an unconscionable level of debt and a bewildering array of duped and angry creditors. Small wonder the father of his future son-in-law saw fit to refer to him as \u201can ill-dealer\u201d. Guy\u2019s handling of this story offers an often vivid picture of the private world in which Gresham moved. But it is difficult not to feel that, when it comes to discussing Gresham\u2019s career, he is thwarted by the aridity of his subject\u2019s profession, as when he (almost comically) alerts us to the revelation that Gresham\u2019s journal is (steady yourself) \u201cthe earliest example from anywhere in the British Isles of double-entry book-keeping\u201d. Equally difficult to ignore is the relentlessly cliched texture of Guy\u2019s prose: \u201cThe fact that she received his letter in stony silence should have sounded alarm bells\u201d; \u201che was exhilarated by the sheer cut and thrust of the markets. He had his finger on their pulse\u201d. This is a pity, for within the onslaught of infelicities the patient reader will find much in these pages that overturns our prevailing assumptions about the true nature and significance of a man the Victorians sought to sanctify. Viewed this way, Gresham emerges not as a figure of honour and integrity, a self-starting hero, a holy benefactor or an uncomplicated patriot, but as an individual whose many private shortcomings both compromised and contributed to \u2013 perhaps even made possible \u2013 the achievements that would characterise his extraordinary public station. \u2022 Gresham\u2019s Law: The Life and World of Queen Elizabeth I\u2019s Banker by John Guy is published by Profile (\u00a325).
