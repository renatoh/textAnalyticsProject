But doctors who work with babies born on the borderline of viability say survival rates before 24 weeks are not going up, and those who live may be physically or mentally damaged. Two substantial studies on the survival of pre-24 week babies have been published in the past few weeks. Neither suggests medical science is gradually rolling back the point of viability. The first was Epicure2, which compared the outcomes for babies born before 26 weeks in the UK in 2006 with those born in 1995. Of the 1,300 babies born before 26 weeks in 2006, 952 survived long enough to be admitted to intensive care. But the rise was among those born after 24 weeks, not before. The second study was carried out by Professor David Field and colleagues in one defined geographical area - the Trent region, which was considered typical. It compared the survival of pre-26 week babies during 1994-1999 with that in 2000-2005. The survival of 23-week-old babies remained at a low 18% and no 22-week babies survived. Survival is not the end of the story, as the original Epicure research on a group of premature babies born 10 years ago has shown. A quarter have severe disabilities, including cerebral palsy, blindness and deafness."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
