Erk. That was a bit too Lawrentian for me. I'm not keen on all that moist, thrusting, trembling, tormented stuff. And fecund is my least favourite word. Luckily it doesn't crop up often, but I heard it mentioned aloud years ago while holidaying with a family in the countryside. A young chap \u2013 their son's geography teacher \u2013 came to stay. He then went for a walk, foolishly leaving his private diary on the kitchen table. \"This family,\" he had written admiringly, \"is fecund with love.\" The family read it out loud and laughed like drains, particularly at That Word. Anyway, the poor guest was quite wrong. Father slept with anything that moved, mother had understandably turned into an acid-tongued ball-crusher, the children were ferociously rebellious, and whatever fecundity there might once have been had withered and died. Which shows how first appearances can be deceptive, like my garden. Fielding hadn't noticed the many shrunken, rotting gourds and shrivelled grapes. He should take care when throwing the word \"fecund\" about. \"Rubbish,\" said he strictly. \"You clearly have a problem with that word. It's to do with Mother Earth, creativity, sexuality, paganism, orgasms and such like. You can't handle it. You've always been like that. Remember our holiday on the naturist beach? We all ripped off our clothes and ran into the sea. You and X just couldn't do it.\" Quite right. We couldn't. Some of us are just more modest and shy than others. \"You mean repressed,\" said Fielding bossily. \"You've got to grow up about this. You need to get in touch with yourself.\" I most certainly don't. I'd much rather play a thunderous, rippling, voluptuous piano sonata. And now I can. The nearer one gets to the grave, the more repressed, odd and anti-fecund one can be. No one cares. Yet another delightful advantage to old age.
