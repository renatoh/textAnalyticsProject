Some of the newspaper's charges against MPs have been justified, others not so, he said. But the rest of the media had not used \"due diligence\" in reporting the Telegraph's version of events without being able to evaluate the same unedited CDs mysteriously obtained from the Commons fees office. A fair point, but is it enough? Three weeks after stepping down from the justice ministry to clear his name Malik was restored to office on Tuesday as parliamentary under-secretary in John Denham's new team at communities and local government. But the Telegraph is not giving up its campaign against the street-smart MP for Dewsbury who became Britain's first Muslim minister two years after finally winning a seat in 2005. Shortly before midnight on Wednesday Downing Street issued the report by Sir Philip Mawer, its independent adviser on the ministerial code of conduct, into allegations that the minister had breached the rules on MPs allowances. Initially No 10 had attempted simply to assert that Mawer had cleared Malik of breaching the code. Under pressure from Sir Christopher Kelly, the standards commissioner, and others, it published the whole report, albeit with most witnesses' names redacted. That in itself is a small, grudging victory for the kind of transparency which Gordon Brown often preaches but finds hard to practise. Mawer is a former civil servant, parliamentary standards watchdog until last year. His report on minister Malik was narrowly focused on whether he had benefited from a preferential rent (\u00a3320 per month) on his office and home at Dewsbury and failed to declare it. He did not address wider issues such as the paper's claim that Malik had claimed \u00a3730 for a massage chair and a total of \u00a366,827 over three years on his second home in London. Wednesday's late-night verdict was that Malik had not benefited from a reduced rent by local market standards, a point endorsed by outside experts, But Mawer mildly observed that it was \"unfortunate\" that the minister had no formal agreement to prove that, when he moved his Dewsbury base to the property next door and started paying a higher rent of \u00a3620 per month for more space, he paid the \u00a3300 extra in cash. Malik explained it was \"a matter of religious observance or a cultural norm\" for Muslims to avoid the banking system, rather than any obvious alternative explanation. A formal rental agreement has since been sought, along with a promise of direct debit payments. The details are complex and in the Telegraph has not retreated in the face of fierce denials, as it has in some of its claims, including the prime minister's cleaning arrangements. Today it extracted the admission that the taxpayer had helped fund the cost of office space in Dewsbury and the minister's second home in London. Westminster colleagues say Malik, a well-known, moderate activist before becoming an MP, is a valued conduit between the mainstream and alienated Muslims. He may also be lucky that media expenses fatigue seems to be setting in."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
