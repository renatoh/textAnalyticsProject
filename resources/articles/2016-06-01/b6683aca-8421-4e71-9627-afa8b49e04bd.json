The site, which measured asking prices for just under 150,000 properties listed over the past month, said they had risen by 0.8% in June, to an average of \u00a3310,471 \u2013 5.5% higher than in June 2015. Asking prices have risen every month so far in 2016, and Rightmove said the rush for properties ahead of April\u2019s stamp duty increase for second homes and the availability of cheap mortgages had supported the market. As a result of increased buyer demand, the average time taken to sell a property dropped to 57 days, compared with 60 in May and 65 in June 2015. The headline figures do not suggest that the looming EU referendum is having an impact on buyers\u2019 decisions, but Rightmove said there were signs that sellers were sitting tight until the outcome is known. \u201cFewer new sellers are coming to market, with this month\u2019s numbers being 5.3% below the monthly average for this time of year since 2010,\u201d the monthly report said. \u201cThe most reluctant are owners of larger homes, those with four or more bedrooms, with 6.6% fewer sellers over the same time period. Given the well-documented structural shortages of housing supply any longer-term reluctance of owners to come to market would be a worrying trend.\u201d Rightmove\u2019s breakdown of asking prices around England and Wales shows monthly increases in all regions except Greater London, where sellers bring properties on to the market asked an average of 0.2% less than in May, at \u00a3643,117. The biggest monthly increases in asking prices were in north-west England, where new sellers asked an average of \u00a3183,482, up 2.2% on May\u2019s figure. Within London there were steep falls in some of the most costly boroughs, with Richmond on Thames recording a 10.2% drop month on month, followed by Kensington and Chelsea, where prices were listed at an average price 9.4% below May\u2019s. Estate agents at the top end of the market have reported reluctance among buyers and sellers to commit to deals ahead of Thursday\u2019s referendum, particularly those investing from overseas. Developers of luxury flats are offering so-called Brexit clauses, alongside discounts and incentives to tempt buyers as the market slows. Rightmove\u2019s director, Miles Shipside, said that in the event of a vote to leave the EU, sellers might need \u201cmore realistic\u201d pricing to achieve a sale. \u201cA vote to remain should mean that the housing market quickly returns to its previous norm, but a vote to leave would create political and economic uncertainty, which historically has had more serious repercussions,\u201d he said. House price website, Zoopla, calculated that Brexit would reverse the gains in house prices property over the past 5 years. Using HM Treasury projections for an 18% fall in house prices, Zoopla said London would be hit hardest with average property values falling between \u00a367,200 and \u00a3121,000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
