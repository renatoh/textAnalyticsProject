The old-fashioned fruit is also enjoying a revival as a result of the introduction of much sweeter \u201csnacking\u201d varieties, eaten straight from the punnet, which have more appeal to consumers. Sales have doubled in a year and British blackberry growers expect this year\u2019s crop to break records with shoppers set to buy 2,000 tonnes of the fruit \u2013 82% more than last year\u2019s 1,123 tonnes. Growers and retailers have identified a shift in consumers\u2019 eating habits, with demand for fruit that can be eaten as a healthy snack rather than the cooked with added sugar for pies and crumbles. \u201cBritish consumers are some of the luckiest in the world when it comes to blackberries,\u201d said Laurence Olins, the chairman of the British Summer Fruits trade body. \u201cThe UK is at the forefront of new technologies and breeding methods, resulting in exceptional quality, flavourful fruit. Our growers have seen the market grow substantially in recent years, by more than 70% in the last decade. They are now developing their offer to include sweeter, snacking varieties which will really transform sales and accelerate growth of the category.\u201d Marks &amp; Spencer said sales had risen after it introduced larger and tastier varieties such as Victoria and Incentive, which are double the size of a normal blackberry. Its team has been working with growers over the last three years to develop a extra-sweet variety. \u201cThis has been a great year for blackberries. The blackberry variety and warm weather we\u2019ve had this summer has helped to make sure they are the biggest yet and are really super-sweet,\u201d Bill Davies, M&amp;S\u2019s fruit expert, said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
