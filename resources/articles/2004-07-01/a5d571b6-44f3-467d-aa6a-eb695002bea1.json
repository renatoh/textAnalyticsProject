Freshfields and Allen &amp; Overy declared that listing particulars relating to the planned flotation of the mobile telephony business would be released only to newspapers which signed a special legal undertaking. Apparently they wanted us to promise not to make bulk copies of the document and under no circumstances distribute it in the US. Obviously we didn't sign, and so these news pages today do not carry an article giving further details of the Virgin float. Virtually every company announce ment, every formal document and every piece of investment analysis produced in this country carries a warning - sometimes in the small print, sometimes at the top of the page - that it is not for distribution in the US. This is because of arcane securities legislation stemming from the 1929 crash. If we were to let this lot set a precedent on this matter we'd be sat here signing disclosure declarations all day long, and this column would not get written. Of course, that might not be a bad thing. But there is a more important principle at stake here. The argument being pushed by Freshfields and Allen &amp; Overy is that Virgin Mobile is not a formal public offer for sale. It is not a flotation in the thoroughly old-fashioned sense of the ordinary public being invited to buy parcels of shares at a pre-set price. Instead, the offer is restricted to professional investors - institutional shareholders. On that basis the Virgin briefs insist that distribution of information, such as that contained in the listing particulars, should be restricted. This is specious in the extreme. Freshfields and Allen &amp; Overy should know that almost all flotations are now done in this manner. The old system is simply too costly and too bureaucratic. They also seem to have forgotten where the money institutions might invest in Virgin actually comes from. At the end of the day, all listed public companies are financed by the public. And any firm that subsequently tries to keep the public in the dark tends to get a bad name. Yesterday, panicky Virgin managers were blaming our beloved Financial Services Authority. And, sure enough, amid the sprawling British listing rules a clause has appeared that allows companies to restrict the flow of information to the media unless the media make certain declarations about what they will do with the information. Apparently, the clause stems from the European commission's consolidated listings directive and had to be included automatically by the FSA. But whose interests are being served here is a complete mystery. What it feels like, from this office, is regulation by stealth. Plane bias The long-standing dogfight between Boeing and Airbus for supremacy in the global market for large commercial jets is threatening to spill over into a nasty trade war between the US and EU. Washington, in the shape of Robert Zoellick, its trade representative, has urged European governments to stop \"subsidies\" for new Airbus planes, arguing that the European firm is now a runaway success. Indeed, last year, for the first time, it overtook Boeing in aircraft deliveries - and will sell more than its rival again this year and next. Mr Zoellick is also threatening to cast aside a 1992 agreement between the US and EU that limits state aid to a third of a project's cost. He is worried that Airbus, as it has indicated, will design and build a rival to Boeing's new 7E7 Dreamliner which won its first (conditional) European orders this week. The civil aviation market remains highly labile, with both Airbus and Boeing struggling to secure firm orders for their new planes, the A380 superjumbo and the smaller 7E7, despite offering hefty discounts and 20% cuts in operating costs. But both American and European administrations consider their industries strategic - that is, worthy of protection at all costs. Murky political machinations lie behind this latest flare-up, which will ignite the forthcoming Farnborough air show. Harry Stonecipher, Boeing's new chief executive, freely admits he has spent a heck of a lot of time in Congress, the White House and the Pentagon restoring relations ruined by recent scandals. He desperately needs to win back the $18bn air-to-air refuelling contract lost as a result of the scandals that brought down his predecessor, Phil Condit. Attacking Airbus over subsidies that threaten American jobs in an election year will not harm his lobbying effort. There is a strong whiff that Harry, a tougher operator than Condit and much readier to mix it with Airbus, is orchestrating the Zoellick d\u00e9marche. And Pascal Lamy, the EU's outgoing trade commissioner, is prepared to mix it too. Even US analysts admit that the subsidies Airbus receives are largely loans repaid at commercial rates and Boeing's rival has not so far defaulted. But the American plane-maker also gets substantial hidden subsidies through its defence and space businesses, especially support for R&amp;D. Strategic industries on either side of the pond clearly merit unswerving political support."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
