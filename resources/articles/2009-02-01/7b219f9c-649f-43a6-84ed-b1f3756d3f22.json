Tottenham Hotspur salvaged an improbable 4\u20134 draw at the Emirates Stadium last October in Redknapp's second game in charge and, with his team buoyed by their unbeaten Premier League record against the so-called \"big four\" this season, he sees vulnerability in Arsenal. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side are unbeaten in 10 matches in all competitions but they have drawn six of them and have sometimes failed to convince. Both teams are desperate for the victory at White Hart Lane: Arsenal to prevent the five-point gap to the fourth-placed Aston Villa from growing and Tottenham to ease their relegation worries. Although they sit in 14th position, they are only one point clear of the bottom three. \"It will be a tough game but we've got a big chance at home,\" Redknapp said. \"It's a decent time to play them. They are a top team, Ars\u00e8ne has done an incredible job, but the record shows that they are not playing as well as they did last year or the year before. Whenever you play Arsenal, though, it's always a tough game. They've got some fantastic players.\" Robbie Keane, newly returned from Liverpool and appointed team captain, will make his second Spurs debut, but Redknapp has a selection dilemma over who to start in goal. Heurelho Gomes is fit again after missing four games with a thigh problem but Carlo Cudicini, who was signed from Chelsea last month, has played in the last two and won praise from Redknapp. \"I'll make a decision,\" the manager said. \"I've got two good goalkeepers.\" Redknapp reiterated that, with a tricky schedule ahead, he considered the club to be in a relegation fight. \"We are still in there,\" he said. \"We've got to go on a run now. We've got 14 hard fixtures and we've got to pick up enough results to make sure we climb the table. Get out of trouble and then we'll have a look at it again in the summer. But I feel now that we have a squad that can push on.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
