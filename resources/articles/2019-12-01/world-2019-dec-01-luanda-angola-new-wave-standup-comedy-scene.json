In a poor neighbourhood near the centre of the Angolan capital, bats wheel in the darkness and loud techno drowns out the traffic on the potholed road. A young crowd has packed into a cavernous and crumbling concrete church in search of comic, rather than spiritual, relief. Many have come to see Artur Pop, a comedian from a tough nearby neighbourhood who draws his material from the lives of young people such as those who have paid 1,000 kwanza \u2013 \u00a31.28 at black market exchange rates, or more than \u00a31.55 at the official bank rate \u2013 for the evening\u2019s entertainment. \u201cHe\u2019s great. He gives us a voice we haven\u2019t ever had before,\u201d says Edamaria Alberto, a 19-year-old student, as she pays for her ticket. Angola receives little global attention, despite an extraordinary recent history of war, boom and bust. The country of 30 million people is now on the brink of a brighter future after decades of chaos, corruption and violence. Yet challenges are multiple \u2013 and could easily derail any tentative progress. Making an appearance at the Santo Ant\u00f3nio church in Hoji Ya Henda is Tiago Costa, the most high-profile of a new wave of young comedians in the vast former Portuguese colony. Costa, 34, remembers two main turning points during his life. The first was the end of the bloody and destructive civil war in 2002. This ushered in an economic boom fuelled by high oil prices \u2013 Angola is a major producer \u2013 and then an equally spectacular crash five years ago. The second was the election of president Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o in 2017 after his predecessor, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, stepped down after 38 years. \u201cTwo years ago people were very nervous when we told a joke. Now the atmosphere is more free. We can say the president is ugly and everyone will laugh. Life in Angola today is like a good barbecue sauce ... It is sweet, but also a bit spicy,\u201d says Costa. The boom saw growth rates among the highest in the world, and glass skyscrapers soared among the rundown colonial buildings of Luanda\u2019s spectacular seafront. The economy is only just recovering from the crash, with government budgets still crippled by massive debts. Dos Santos was widely accused of nepotism and industrial-scale corruption. Huge sums remain unaccounted for. Louren\u00e7o, who was defence minister under the former president, has vowed to fight corruption and surprised observers with a swath of initiatives soon after taking power. But analysts say the pace of reform has slowed and frustration is mounting. \u201cPolitics is still a sensitive subject but there are lots of good jokes about the former president and his family,\u201d says Maestro Ignacio, one of the new comedians who is a close collaborator of Costa at Goz\u2019aqui, an online platform production company and general humour factory in Luanda. Another target is the People\u2019s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), the party that has ruled Angola for more than four decades. The bloody conflict that followed independence from Portugal in 1975 is also material for the comics. \u201cThe [audiences] don\u2019t mind me making fun of the civil war \u2026 because they don\u2019t have a vivid memory of it. Most were kids,\u201d says Ignacio, 39. Emmanuel Quituto, a video producer who was 10 years old when the war ended with the death of Jonas Savimbi, the leader of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (Unita), agrees. \u201cI lost an uncle in the war. We don\u2019t know what happened to him. His body was never found. But I find the jokes funny,\u201d says Quituto. The conflict ruined Angola, and today, while a small elite enjoys the fruits of the economic boom, millions of Angolans remain mired in deep poverty. The profound inequality is evident to the most casual visitor to Luanda. Out on the Ilha, a narrow spit of sand extending into the Atlantic Ocean, wealthy business people or well-connected officials enjoy seafood lunches with South African wines for about \u00a340 a head. At the marina, yachts manned by Italian crews are moored next to an infinity pool. In the centre of the city, SUVs bounce over the potholes. But there are also vast poor neighbourhoods where rubbish and stray dogs fill the streets and families live in breezeblock houses. Then there are the miles of urban sprawl: factories, shabby malls and apartment blocks alongside Chinese-built roads. Even in the centre of Luanda there are pockets of desperate poverty. \u201cWe can see the big buildings where the rich people live and we wonder why the government does nothing for us,\u201d says Talitha Miguel, 41, who lives in a makeshift corrugated home in a crowded squatter camp a short walk from the parliament\u2019s new \u00a3154m neocolonial style building. Even the inequality provides material for the new wave of comedians. \u201cI find what people enjoy the most is when I talk about things that happen on a regular basis to regular people. So I joke about drinking because there\u2019s a lot of alcohol abuse, and about how difficult it is to get a girlfriend when you\u2019re poor,\u201d says Ladilson Manuel, 26, whose YouTube channel has 35,000 subscribers. Ra\u00fal Danda, the vice-president of opposition party Unita, believes the time has come for politicians to offer an inclusive programme for all Angolans. \u201cWe don\u2019t want there to be first-, second- or third-class citizens here \u2026 Angolans need to be treated equally. The president needs to be a father to all the people,\u201d Danda says. The comedians are aware that their audience represents only a small and relatively privileged part of Luanda\u2019s inhabitants. \u201cComedians must have a social responsibility,\u201d says Costa. \u201cWe are not just there to put smiles on people\u2019s faces. There is unemployment, the cost of living is higher than ever. With our jokes we can make people reflect on what we have done in our country, what we are doing and, I hope, what we should do.\u201d Arturo Pop has a less elevated vision of his role. \u201cI just talk about my life,\u201d he says. \u201cWe might not have enough to eat, but you can always laugh.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
