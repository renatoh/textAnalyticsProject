Responding to a landmark report by the Productivity Commission, released on Tuesday, O\u2019Dwyer said she was \u201cvery encouraged\u201d by a proposal to overhaul the superannuation system by creating a new body to recommend 10 high-performing funds to workers but stopped short of promising to implement this central recommendation. The deputy chair of the commission, Karen Chester, said the odds were stacked against super fund members due to \u201cunintended multiple accounts and persistent underperformance\u201d from some funds. \u201cThe impact of that is highly regressive, it causes a great harm to young people, workers on low incomes and workers in and out of work,\u201d she told ABC AM. Sign up to receive the top stories every morning The Productivity Commission found that more than a quarter of the 74 funds offering MySuper product failed to meet benchmark performance returns. If workers in those funds had moved to the median of the top-10 performing products \u201cthey would collectively have gained an additional $1.3bn a year\u201d, it said. \u201cIf a new job entrant ended up in an underperforming super fund they would be short-changed $375,000 when they come to retire,\u201d Chester said. Employees do have the ability to choose their fund but, in practice, many are allocated an industry superannuation fund by their enterprise agreement or are allocated a default fund, chosen by the Fair Work Commission, through an industrial award. The Productivity Commission proposed that employees submitting a tax file number should be able to choose from a list of up to 10 of the best funds, to be decided by an independent panel every four years. The chief executive of the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, Martin Fahy, warned that this approach would wipe out a large number of medium-sized funds over time and harm competition. \u201cWe need to be careful there are not unintended consequences from a government-appointed body selecting 10 funds,\u201d he told ABC News Breakfast. Asked whether this new system undermined consumer choice, Chester suggested it was necessary to combat the proliferation of unintended multiple accounts \u2013 which currently number 10m \u2013 resulting in unwanted fees and insurance contributions costing workers $2.6bn a year. O\u2019Dwyer told Radio National on Monday that the report had \u201cblown the whistle for millions of Australians\u201d, revealing that superannuation funds \u201chave not always been acting in the best interests of their members\u201d. O\u2019Dwyer said that about one-third of accounts were \u201cunintended multiple accounts\u201d because \u201cemployers have forced them into a particular fund of their choice or unions have through enterprise agreements\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that\u2019s right and we know it needs to be fixed.\u201d O\u2019Dwyer called on Labor to back government legislation to prevent enterprise agreements nominating workers\u2019 super fund. She said the Productivity Commission had proposed \u201ca really clever solution\u201d by recommending an independent organisation to pick 10 \u201cbest in show\u201d funds, which would be an improvement on the \u201chighly politicised\u201d FWC choosing default funds. The chief executive of Industry Super, David Whiteley, said the report found that industry and not-for-profit funds were the best performing and the default system had served workers better than when they chose or were sold a fund. Whiteley told Sky News the proposal for a \u201cbest in show\u201d shortlist was an \u201cexperimental\u201d plan that would mean disengaged teenagers were making decisions for their retirement. On Tuesday Labor shadow treasurer Chris Bowen did not rule out supporting the Productivity Commission recommendations but called on the Coalition to drop \u201cideological\u201d attacks on industry super if it wanted cooperation. In the 2018 budget the treasurer, Scott Morrison, announced changes including a ban on exit fees for superannuation. The super package includes a 3% annual cap on the fees that can be charged on passive accounts with balances below $6,000, to prevent low super balances from being eroded by ever-rising fees. O\u2019Dwyer said the government would \u201cproactively return people\u2019s money to them through the taxation office\u201d if they have a lost or inactive account, which would result in $6bn a year being returned to members instead of eaten up by fees and charges."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
