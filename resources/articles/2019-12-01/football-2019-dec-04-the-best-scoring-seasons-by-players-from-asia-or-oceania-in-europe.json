If we are talking about the top five leagues in Europe (Spain, Italy, England, France and Germany) the answer is second. New Zealand\u2019s Wynton Rufer scored 17 goals for Werder Bremen in 1992-93 to lead them to the Bundesliga title by one point. The striker, who was named Oceania Player of the Century, was also joint-top scorer in the 1993-94 Champions League with eight goals alongside Barcelona\u2019s Ronald Koeman. Staying in Germany, South Korean striker Cha Bum-kun also scored 17 for Bayer Leverkusen in 1985-86, finishing fourth in the standings. In total, he scored 98 Bundesliga goals (only six foreigners have scored more) during a decade with Leverkusen and Eintracht Frankfurt, and won the Uefa Cup with both clubs. A legend of the game. Outside of those Big Five leagues, here are a few Australians, offered by Phil Hawkins, that have topped the scoring charts in their respective European divisions: Scott McDonald (Celtic, Scotland) 2007-08 Clayton Zane (Lillestr\u00f8m, Norway) 2001 Mark Viduka (Celtic, Scotland) 1999-2000 Aurelio Vidmar (Standard Li\u00e8ge, Belgium) 1994-95 Frank Farina (Club Brugge, Belgium) 1989-90 Edward Krncevic (Anderlecht, Belgium) 1988-89 One other significant name to mention is Paulino Alc\u00e1ntara, who represented the country of his birth, the Philippines, just once but went on to become Barcelona\u2019s all-time scorer \u2013 a record he held until a certain Lionel Messi turned up. Season-by-season scoring breakdowns of his time in Catalonia (1912-16, 1918-27) are hard to come by but, after scoring 395 goals in 399 games, it\u2019s safe to say that he probably finished top of the scoring charts in some capacity, even if Barcelona played in an exclusively Catalan league at that time. A knack for getting sacked \u201cWhich manager has been sacked the most times?\u201d ponders Adam Burns. To have longevity in the game and get repeatedly sacked is a skill in itself. There\u2019s some muddying of the waters by the semantics of \u201cparting company by mutual consent\u201d but we\u2019ve done our best to delve into finding the true sackings. Zdenek Zeman has notched up managerial posts at an incredible rate since taking over at Licata in 1983. Currently he is in charge at Pescara, his 22nd role as a head coach. Throughout his 43-year career, the former swimming coach has been handed his marching orders seven times, but mutual consent fans might argue otherwise. In one season at Cagliari he was sacked in December and returned to replace Gianfranco Zola in March. Former Italy boss Gian Piero Ventura has had plenty of ups and downs during his time in management. For someone who has managed the Italian national team, he has few honours to his name, with the height being the 1994-95 Serie C title won at Lecce. Due to his lack of silverware, few will be surprised to learn he has had his bags forcibly packed on seven occasions. Radi Antic, Luton legend, was sacked three times by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, but only another four times overall, leaving him also with seven dismissals to his name. As with with many top European managers, Antic decided to see out his management career in China. His final two dismissals were from Shandong Luneng Taishan and Hebei Zhongji. Claudio Ranieri has an impressive CV, having managed across Europe, won the Premier League, and lost to the Faroe Islands during a four-game spell as Greece manager. Now 66, the Italian can boast 20 different spells as a manager, leading clubs such as Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Chelsea, Juventus and Leicester. Ranieri has only been sacked on nine occasions, which isn\u2019t bad, all things considered. In October, he agreed to take over at struggling Sampdoria. He has done OK so far but with the club in danger of slipping into the relegation zone again, the Italian is in danger of experiencing a 10th sacking somewhere down the line. \u2022 Any gaffers who can top the Tinkerman? Email knowledge@theguardian.com or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU. Goal-hungry teams of 10 men \u201cJust the other weekend, Mainz were leading 1-0 away at Hoffenheim when they had a player sent off. Mainz ended up scoring four more goals despite being a man down, winning the game 5-1. Has any team scored more goals despite having a numerical disadvantage?\u201d tweeted @sunray_ravi. They certainly have. \u201cLast month, on 19 November, Gibraltar\u2019s under-19s played Switzerland in European Championship qualifying\u201d begins Brian Spurrell. \u201cSwitzerland were leading 5-0 on 35 minutes when their captain Noel Wetz was sent off. Gibraltar pulled a goal back, their first in 12 games, but Switzerland added a further 11 goals while down to 10 men (including six in the last 13 minutes) to win 16-1.\u201d Knowledge archive \u201cManchester United have used three \u2018Vans\u2019 during the Premier League era: Ruud Van Nistelrooy, Robin Van Persie and Louis Van Gaal,\u201d began Adam Morris in January 2015. \u201cHas any other clubs had more Vans than this? Can anyone name all of the Vans that have played in the Premier League since it started?\u201d Manchester United have had four playing Vans in the Premier League era \u2013 the aforementioned Van Nistelrooy and Van Persie, but also Edwin van der Sar and Raimond van der Gouw \u2013 plus their current manager, making Old Trafford the undisputed king of the Vans. Tottenham, next in line to the throne, have had two \u2013 Pat van de Hauwe and Rafael van der Vaart \u2013 but no other team has had more than one. We think this is a comprehensive list: Raimond van der Gouw (Man Utd); Pierre van Hooijdonk (Nottingham Forest); Andy van der Meyde (Everton); Ruud van Nistelrooy (Man Utd); Robin van Persie (Arsenal, Man Utd); Edwin van der Sar (Fulham, Man Utd); Rafael van der Vaart (Tottenham); Daniel van Buyten (Man City); Jelle van Damme (Southampton, Wolves); Pat van den Hauwe (Tottenham), Ricky van Wolfswinkel (Norwich), Dennis van Wijk (Norwich). Since first publication we can add Virgil van Dijk to that list, too. Can you help? \u201cWith the interim appointment of Freddie Ljungberg as Arsenal manager, the Gunners now have a former professional underwear model in charge,\u201d begins Sam Rowe. \u201cAre there any other managers who have once been models, past or present, excluding players modelling their team\u2019s kit?\u201d \u201cWith Mauricio Pochettino and Unai Emery relieved of their duties within 10 days of each other, is this the quickest sacking of both managers on either side of a derby rivalry?\u201d asks Sean DeLoughry. Ben Scott muses: \u201cWhat percentage of new managers win their first home game in charge? Does any manager have a 100% win record in their home games?\u201d \u2022 Email your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
