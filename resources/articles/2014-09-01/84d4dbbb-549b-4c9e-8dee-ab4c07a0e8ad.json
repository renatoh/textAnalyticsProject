The Institute of Education report, commissioned by MPs on the cross-party education select committee, found the system had improved in the past two years \u2013 but checks and balances on conflicts of interest remained \"too weak\" with \"questionable practices\" still being signed off. In addition, the ability of the system to pick up on \"intangible conflicts that do not involve money\", like those that emerged in the case of the Trojan horse schools in Birmingham, seemed \"almost nonexistent\". Nevertheless, the report's authors stated: \"The widespread view is that the vast majority of academy trusts are staffed by honourable people working hard to address education underperformance, often in challenging circumstances.\" Deliberate fraud was \"rare\" and many of the cases involving real or perceived conflicts were \"the result of people being asked to work too fast with too few controls\". The real or potential conflicts of interest listed in the report nevertheless make interesting reading. One anonymous interviewee told researchers about an academy \"where the headteacher had spent \u00a350,000 on a one-day training course run by their friend\", a decision that was not run past the governors. In another academy \"the chair of governors had told all staff that if they discussed with students or used textbooks referencing abortion or contraception they would be dismissed\". In other examples that have been previously reported in the media, the Aurora Academies Trust, with four primary schools in East Sussex, was said to have paid its US parent company, Mosaica Education Inc, about \u00a3100,000 a year to use its patented global curriculum, called Paragon. When the Observer reported the story last year, an Aurora spokesperson was quoted saying the curriculum was provided on an \"at cost\" basis and \"all of the money from the schools is put into running the schools\". The Academies Enterprise Trust, which runs 80 schools and has been barred from taking on more because of concerns about over-expansion, paid nearly \u00a3500,000 into the private business interests of its trustees and executives over three years for services ranging from project management to HR consultancy, the report says. At the time the payments were reported, again in the Observer last year, an AET spokesman said there was evidence that the academy chain was among the better performers in the sector, and that while services provided by trustees and staff had not been put out to competitive tender, AET had followed all the correct procedures. And the Grace Academy Trust, which runs three schools in the Midlands and was set up by Tory party donor, Lord Edmiston, has paid more than \u00a31m either directly to, or via companies owned or controlled by Lord Edmiston or members of the board of trustees and their relatives, according to the report. Responding to Wednesday's research, Nansi Ellis, assistant general secretary of policy at the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL), said: \"It is vital that the public can have confidence that this money is being spent to improve children's education and not to line the pockets of shareholders and chief executives. \"Unfortunately, cases of financial mismanagement, conflicts of interest and poor educational standards keep coming to light, suggesting that the government does not have proper oversight of its academies.\" Prof Toby Greany and Jean Scott, who carried out the study, recommended a review of the rules governing sponsors providing paid services to their academies, which they said were \"insufficiently robust\". Under the current system, sponsors providing services for school improvement or back-office support can charge if they are doing the work \"at cost\" and not for profit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
