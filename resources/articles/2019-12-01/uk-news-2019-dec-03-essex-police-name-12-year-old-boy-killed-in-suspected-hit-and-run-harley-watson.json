Harley died in hospital after being hit by a car outside Debden Park high school, in Essex, where he was a student. Four other teenagers and a woman in her 20s sustained non-life-threatening injuries. A 51-year-old man, from nearby Loughton, has been arrested on suspicion of murder and six offences of attempted murder, leading to speculation that the teenagers were deliberately targeted. He was also arrested on suspicion of one offence of causing death by dangerous driving, six offences of causing serious injury by driving, failing to stop at the scene of a collision, and driving without insurance. Tributes poured in, with more than 40 bouquets and handwritten cards addressed to Harley, the \u201cfunniest\u201d boy, adorning the school wall. \u201cForever in our heart. Fly high,\u201d read one. \u201cYou will be missed, it won\u2019t be the same without you,\u201d another said. At the scene, 12-year-old Eli Claarson and his mother, Simone, came to lay flowers and pay their respects. \u201cI went to primary school with Harley,\u201d Eli said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen each other since year 6 but we still chatted online. It\u2019s so sad to know he\u2019s gone. He was so caring and would never have done anything to anyone.\u201d Simone added: \u201cAs a parent, it really makes me concerned about the kids. I worry for them getting home after school.\u201d In a statement, Christian Cavanagh, the executive headteacher of Debden Park high, said Watson \u201chad made his mark on the school\u201d and was \u201cliked and loved by staff and students\u201d. Helen Gascoyne, the head of the school, said the whole school community were devastated. Many people wept as they arrived to lay tributes at the school throughout the morning. Sandra Lyfield, 68, who lives close to the school, said: \u201cIt\u2019s shocking when something like that happens around here. Even if you don\u2019t know the people, it\u2019s just horrible. It chokes you up. I walk my dog down there, and today it\u2019s so sombre, with people crying.\u201d \u201cEveryone\u2019s just really sad\u201d, said 34-year-old James English, a local resident. \u201cThe kids normally play and ride their bikes down here, doing wheelies on the street. Now everyone\u2019s just really sad.\u201d \u201cIt could be anybody\u2019s child, it\u2019s just horrific\u201d, another resident, who did not wish to give her name, said. There was still an extensive cordon in place at the scene of the crash on Tuesday morning, with much of Willingale Road closed to the public and a heavy police presence nearby. The school itself remained open, and was offering counselling to those affected by the event, while police photographers and investigation teams worked to gather evidence on the street outside. Officers said they were unsure how long the area would remain closed, but hoped the cordon would be lifted later on Tuesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
