Potentially compelling soap partnerships are being forged (surly Shirley and hapless Heather; gallumping mechanic Minty and Hazel, his fiancee and his best friend's mum) and, happily, Walford is beginning to more accurately reflect London, with the recent introduction of the Masoods, a Muslim family. Plot is not being neglected, though, with the Beales' recent tribulations reaching a loud and messy climax atop a tower block. (That sounds rude. It isn't.) Emmylou Harris Night From 8pm, BBC4 If, as you can judge someone by the calibre of their friends, you can appraise a musician on the quality of their collaborations, Emmylou Harris is a class act indeed. From her work with Linda Ronstadt and Neil Young, Dolly Parton and Beck to her relationship with the legendary Gram Parsons, Harris has kept stellar company. Of course, evaluate Harris entirely on her own merits and you again discern an astounding artist. Her diffident brilliance is celebrated here with a profile and cracking performances, including rarely seen clips from the BBC's archive. Comedy Showcase: Ladies and Gentlemen 10.30pm, Channel 4 Written by Sam Bain and Jesse Armstrong (Peep Show, The Thick of It) and boasting a pedigree cast, which includes Reece Shearsmith, Darren Boyd and Rosie Cavaliero, the second in this commendable comic endeavour doesn't quite deliver the laughs you might expect. The tale of a houseshare in Victorian London, it is silly and clever and marvellously parodies the conventions, characters and cliches of Victorian fiction. With relatives on deathbeds, frustrated spinsters only occupied with embroidery and ebullient doctors, it provides some smirks but there are no laugh-out-loud moments."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
