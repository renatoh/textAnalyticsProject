Yet despite many parties commenting on the need for change in their manifestos, the issue of political reform has been dangerously absent from the campaign trail. This radio silence is indefensible when polling for the Electoral Reform Society shows 85% of people feel that politics isn\u2019t working, and 80% feel they have little or no influence on decision-making today. With public faith this low our politicians cannot afford to stay silent. The signs of democratic decay are all around us \u2013 from an electoral system that wastes votes on an industrial scale, to the private members\u2019 club that is the unelected House of Lords. This year we\u2019ve seen our parliament lunge from crisis to crisis. This election is a watershed moment for our democracy \u2013 inaction is not an option. Today we are calling for leaders to make the issue of updating and transforming Westminster front and centre, as part of #DemocracyDay. We are asking them all to commit to a constitutional convention involving citizens, to set out how to reform Westminster after the election. There is a high degree of cross-party unity around issues like updating Britain\u2019s analogue-age campaign rules, spreading power outside of London and reining in our crumbling constitution. With trust in politics at record lows, voters want to see parties open up about how to overhaul Westminster. Today is an opportunity to do just that. It is time for all parties to present their proposals with pride and passion. This Democracy Day, let\u2019s start to build a better politics.
