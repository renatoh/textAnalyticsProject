Less than 24 hours after quitting as chief executive of the company that he set up three years ago, on Friday Cohen was back where he began: helping the Liberal Democrats' electioneering efforts. A former speech writer for the party, Cohen is now helping Charles Kennedy reach out to voters through email marketing campaigns. The Lib Dems will be hoping Cohen's best efforts prove more effective than they did at Beenz. Unless the firm can find a buyer by the end of June it will be wound down. For the majority of new media sector watchers it will come as little surprise. Beenz, despite backing from some of the world's highest-profile investors, has long been one of the top tips for the chop. Cohen believed that Beenz could become a new kind of currency for the internet. Websites and vendors could reward their users or customers with \"beenz\" that could be redeemed for goods at participating websites. It was a currency that would be truly global, overcoming national boundaries, languages and foreign currency issues. Thirteen offices were opened worldwide and you couldn't avoid Beenz-branded taxis in locations as far apart as San Francisco and London. As recently as last summer more than 250 staff were still employed by the business. Now there are fewer than 30 left in just two offices in New York and London. The preoccupation for those that remain is a dignified exit for their investors. Despite building a database of almost 6m names, Beenz has, like many other firms exposed to e-commerce, failed to turn users into revenues. Consumers haven't bought online in the huge numbers that were originally forecast. Web loyalty firms have not improved customer retention levels as merchants had hoped. Many of Beenz's customers, who were also dot.coms, have gone bust. And the company's backers, who include Oracle chief Larry Ellison, Vivendi, Softbank and Apax Partners, are reluctant to add to the \u00a361m they have already invested on the off chance that the business model may yet prove itself. The shutters have gone down in the venture capital world and loss-making, unproven businesses do not hold the same attraction as they did a year ago. Reality has struck, financiers are more risk-averse and only the strongest dot.coms will continue to be funded. Cohen has done all he can to keep Beenz going. Last December, when the business first publicly acknowledged the cracks in its model, he insisted: \"We don't want to be one of these dot.coms that rockets along like a train, crashes into a wall and everybody dies.\" An ongoing \"strategic review\" has seen large tranches of staff laid off, and joint ventures in Japan, Hong Kong, Korea and Italy have either been closed or are closing. In recent weeks unused \"beenz\" have been bought back from vendors, reducing the company's outstanding liabilities. The cuts have become so deep that, at a board meeting last Thursday, it was decided Cohen and the chief operating officer, Donald Maguire, would go too. They could no longer justify drawing salaries now the business had been so dramatically scaled back, Cohen said. Underlining how Beenz's future may now simply be about damage limitation, the two most senior remaining executives are an accountant and a lawyer. Talks are ongoing to sell Beenz's assets, consisting primarily of its brand, its database and its technology. The latter two are likely to be the most valuable but, even if a buyer does emerge, shareholders will still end up out of pocket. They are unlikely to be the last. If there is one dot.com executive more relentlessly upbeat than Cohen, it is Sportal's Rob Hersov. Like the Beenz founder, Hersov has spent the past few weeks locked in meetings, desperately trying to persuade investors to save his sports website business. Somehow he has kept his sense of humour. The South African is a salesman's salesman, but acknowledges that unless Sportal raises another \u00a36m within the next few days he will be forced to put the business into administration. Potential buyers are understood to have taken a look and left. An injection of cash appears to be the only option remaining. Even Hersov admits the likelihood of that is only \"50-50\". What will be particularly galling to Hersov is that a little over a year ago Vivendi looked like putting a \u00a3270m takeover offer on the table, only for the dot.com bubble to burst and the deal collapse. It makes BSkyB's decision to pay \u00a3301m for Sportal's loss-making rival Sports Internet all the more mystifying. At least the satellite broadcaster only took a minority stake in Hersov's firm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
