Scotland Yard said that Abdullah el-Faisal, from Stratford, east London, had been held for encouraging \"others to murder persons unknown\". He will appear before Bow Street magistrates court tomorrow. The Jamaican-born cleric, who regularly preached on Saturdays in a centre close to the East London Mosque, Whitechapel, has been under investigation by Scotland Yard for several weeks, following protests in the House of Commons. Mr El-Faisal, also known as Shaikh Faisal, was arrested at a house in Ilford, Essex, at around 7am on Monday. He was taken to a central London police station and detectives were yesterday granted an extra 24 hours to question him. The offence with which he has been charged comes under the 1861 Offences against the Person Act and has been rarely used in recent years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
