But whether that would be good for the England and Wales Cricket Board or the game's supporters is another matter. Under the plan, the next but one home Ashes series would take place during the summer of 2016 rather than 2017. The aim is to shift the timing of the subsequent Australian series so that the teams are not going directly from the Ashes into the ICC one-day World Cup. But the plan would leave the Ashes clashing with not only the 2016 Olympics (for which the favourites are Chicago and Rio de Janeiro), but taking place during the same summer as a major international football tournament in the shape of Euro 2016. And it would leave the following summer as a sporting wasteland in terms of international events. That would not please venues, broadcasters, fans or sponsors. It is unlikely that either the epic 2005 Ashes series or the current one would have had the same impact in an Olympic or international football tournament year. Expect a vigorous debate when the plans are considered later this year. No birds nests for this Olympic stadium The Olympic Delivery Authority has made a crucial appointment as it battles to keep the complex project on time and on budget while entering its most crucial phase. An eight-year-old harris hawk called Willow has been called in to act as a deterrent to pigeons and nesting birds on the stadium structure that is rapidly rising out of the ground in east London. Apparently the birds can become a dangerous nuisance if allowed to take over the site unchecked. Officials have continually insisted that the Stratford designs should not be compared to Beijing's Bird Nest Stadium but this is perhaps their boldest attempt yet to avoid any comparisons. The naked gasometer The gasometer at The Oval has been a favoured target for ambush marketers in recent years. During the last Ashes series Southern Electricity installed a huge wraparound to tweak the nose of official Test sponsors npower. During the more recent ICC World Twenty20, the ECB gained control of the site and sold it to Pepsi to prevent rivals spoiling its official deal. But yesterday the gasometer was naked, perhaps the latest indication of the recession hitting discretionary marketing budgets. The News of the World hit on a much cheaper marketing wheeze by handing out Kevin Pietersen masks, so that even if their columnist wasn't seen on the pitch there were plenty of slightly more portly versions to be seen among the massed ranks of the Barmy Army. Delhi defuses fears Representatives from all 71 competing nations of the Commonwealth Games will attend a security summit in Delhi next month, at which organisers will attempt to allay fears about the event taking place in the city in 2010. The Commonwealth Games Federation president, Mike Fennell, said athletes had approached him at the World Championships in Berlin to seek their own assurances about security in the region. But the organising committee chairman, Suresh Kalmadi, insisted that everything possible was being done to address security concerns and said the recent decision of the England badminton team not to travel to the world championships in Hyderabad would not affect international perceptions. Security fears have dominated preparations for the Games since the terrorist attacks on Mumbai last year. Kalmadi, who was yesterday meeting the BBC in an attempt to end a stalemate over the rights to show the games, also attempted to assuage concerns that venues would not be ready in time. owen.gibson@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
