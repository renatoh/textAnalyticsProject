Byrne also shed light on internal discussions over how the chancellor, Alistair Darling, plans to spend an expected windfall, if payment of unemployment benefits is lower than expected and receipts from the one-off tax on bankers come in higher \u2013 the \"automatic stabilisers\". Last autumn's pre-budget report had predicted borrowing for this year would be \u00a3178bn but the British Chambers of Commerce is now forecasting it may be \u00a3163bn. Speaking on BBC2's Daily Politics, Byrne said: \"I can tell you this is not going to be a big give-away budget\". But he acknowledged that healthier automatic stabilisers were complicating government thinking about the scale of departmental spending cuts it could announce. Byrne said: \"If unemployment does go down then we might get a windfall of \u00a35bn that you can either use to pay down debt, or put into public spending. To give you a sense of this, \u00a35bn is bigger than the budgets of at least five government departments.\" Explaining why he did not think there would new tax rises, Byrne expressly ruled out a rise in VAT to 20% \u2013 something which the Conservatives have not dismissed. Byrne said there would be no new tax increases and, asked if he would increase VAT to 20%, said: \"We don't see a need to [raise VAT] and that's because we've made difficult decisions on national insurance, that have not been hugely popular.\" The comments were among the first by Treasury ministers after Gordon Brown announced the date of the budget for the last week of March, six weeks before the probable date of a general election. The prime minister has been accused of toying with expensive giveaways in the budget to smooth Labour's general election campaign, and it has been reported that the prime minister disagreed with Darling on this issue. Within government there is debate about whether any surplus in the public finances should go towards the fiscal deficit or investing in public spending commitments. Darling also warned not to expect a giveaway. \"I don't think anyone's expecting some sort of Christmas-tree of a budget,\" he said. \"They're not going to get anything like that. What you're going to get is a sensible budget, a budget for the times in which we live, a budget for the future of the country.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
