This competition, courtesy of a 2-1 win against Exeter in the first round, had provided their only refuge in recent weeks, but now that is in the past. If Brighton's recent form - eight successive league defeats - has been disastrous, Ipswich have not been much better. A run of five league games without a win has left them 19th in the First Division, but here the gulf between the sides seemed closer to the two divisions that separated them last season than the current gap of four places. Despite the absence of their injured captain Matt Holland the home side dominated the first-half with Pablo Counago the outstanding player. After Brighton had taken an early lead through Dean Hammond, a 19-year-old making his full debut, Ipswich eased ahead within 15 minutes. Darren Bent scored the first, from Jamie Clapham's low cross, before Counago took Clapham's through-ball,turned Adam Virgo and stroked home. Ipswich added a third when Darren Ambrose cut inside Virgo and unleashed a 22-yard shot which bounced off the bar into the turf, back on to the bar a further two times and out, the linesman giving Ipswich the benefit of any doubt. Ipswich (4-4-2): Marshall; Wilnis, McGreal, Brown, Hreidarsson; Ambrose (George, 60), Wright, Magilton, Clapham; Counago (M Bent, 60), D Bent. Brighton (4-3-3): Petterson; Watson, Cullip, Virgo, Mayo; Oatway (Melton, 64), Hammond, Carpenter; Brooker, Hart, Piercy (McPhee, 37).
