They were photographed up close and personal by the artist Laura Dodsworth with their owners invited to sit, look and talk about them afterwards as part of a project that follows on from similar ones she has done involving breasts and penises (separately, for the avoidance of doubt). Presumably the powers that be thought calling it 100 Vulvas would lead too many unsuspecting viewers to settle down in anticipation of a programme about the history of Swedish engineering. It was not. It did what it should have said on the tin. My mother was a gynaecologist for nearly 40 years and I now feel like the Queen Mother felt about the bombed-out East End after Buckingham Palace was hit; I can look her in the eye. Mainly because I\u2019m never looking at anyone anywhere else ever again. My unwillingness, nay inability, to face one, let alone 100 vulvas is very much the point of Dodsworth\u2019s project and the programme. My labiaversity is symptomatic of a world in which, as the various women who took part noted, its physical appearance and makeup is rarely discussed. And while we are taught endlessly about the blood, birth and pain it will bring to us, its potential for pleasure is only ever really noted in relation to others. \u201cWe live in a society that treats women entirely like a cock pocket,\u201d said one woman. That makes it sound like an angry programme. It wasn\u2019t, although there were expressions of it throughout, especially in the sections about rape and other violence done to women. \u201cI wasn\u2019t prepared,\u201d said Dodsworth in voiceover, \u201cfor the amount of trauma and pain I\u2019d hear about.\u201d There were accounts from women raped in childhood, too young even to put words to their experience. A woman who had undergone full female genital mutilation (\u201cWe were lucky \u2013 we could afford a local anaesthetic\u201d) spent six years in hospital and was rendered infertile as a result \u2013 \u201cAll to prove to my future husband that I was a virgin.\u201d And there were testimonies from women alienated from their bodies by the effects of extreme religious upbringings (\u201cIt having a smell, having hair \u2013 that\u2019s something I\u2019m still working on,\u201d said a young woman whose fear of sin had induced vaginismus for years), women sewn up incorrectly after birth and other brutal, unacknowledged truths that have spanned the ages. What it undoubtedly was, instead, was gently but firmly and relentlessly radical. It\u2019s not until you see a full set of female genitals filling your screen that you realise how little you see anything of or about them in wider culture. It\u2019s not until you hear women laughing and describing how they masturbate and how their bodies change as they do that you recognise that while male masturbation is an openly acknowledged fact (and practically a sitcom staple), the female equivalent is effectively denied, except when co-opted in service to porn. And it\u2019s not until you hear women talking candidly about their own bodies that you realise how little you know about your own, or how your friends feel about theirs. It\u2019s not until you hear women talking honestly about birth or loss of virginity, infertility or menopause that you realise just how much obfuscatory cant you usually hear, and how narrow even the most broadminded approaches and attitudes are. Dodsworth\u2019s photographs and film, and the women who have chosen to spread their legs for her lens, strip away the absurd normalisation of all this in a way I cannot remember having seen before (and I think I would \u2013 I was still seeing vulvae when I closed my eyes two nights later). I rarely use the word, because it makes my teeth itch, but it was genuinely empowering. I still don\u2019t fully understand my mother choosing to spend four decades at the business end and I\u2019m certainly still not going to look at mine. But by the end of the hour I was no longer screaming and automatically lunging for the remote whenever another quartet of lips filled the screen. Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day and 40 years of internalised misogyny coupled with natural squeamishness cannot be dismantled in an hour. But in such small increments, here brought about by others\u2019 considerable confidence, bravery, selflessness and artistry, do we measure progress."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
