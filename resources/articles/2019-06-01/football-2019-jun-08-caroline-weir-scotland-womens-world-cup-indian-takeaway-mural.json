Dunfermline may lack similar artistic pulling power but, these days, Scotland\u2019s Caroline Weir is not merely one of Shelley Kerr\u2019s most accomplished players. The attacking midfielder blessed with a bewitching left foot is still adjusting to the reality that her face beams down from a giant mural adorning the exterior of an Indian takeaway in her home town. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit crazy,\u201d she says. \u201cMe and Claire Emslie were talking about murals the other day because she\u2019s got one in Leith.\u201d Through the windows of the team hotel lobby near the Promenade des Anglais, a warm, restorative sun dapples the hotel\u2019s jasmine and bougainvillea-filled garden. All is outwardly serene but Scotland\u2019s emotions as they enter their first World Cup finals and prepare for Sunday\u2019s opener against England are rather more highly charged. \u201cThe attention we\u2019re getting is a bit mad, a bit crazy,\u201d says Weir. \u201cBut it\u2019s something that hasn\u2019t happened overnight and we\u2019ve always wanted the country to get involved and be interested in women\u2019s football so we\u2019re embracing it. \u201cIt\u2019s all gone to a new level and it\u2019s not something I ever expected to happen when I was growing up in Dunfermline, but I feel very honoured. My dad spotted the mural a few days ago and sent me a picture. It\u2019s near my old primary school, Pittencrieff, but it\u2019s painted on the side of an Indian takeaway. It\u2019s called the Royal Bengal and, to be fair, it\u2019s quite popular, so I\u2019ve been buzzing. I haven\u2019t eaten there myself, but I\u2019ve heard good reports.\u201d Moreover, the mural appears to be bolstering local pride. \u201cI\u2019ve been getting supportive messages from people across Fife and I feel very honoured to be representing them in a small way,\u201d says Weir. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what will happen to the image after the World Cup. I hope it\u2019ll stay there for a little bit longer, but there\u2019s a lot of rain in Dunfermline so maybe it\u2019ll wash it off.\u201d The Manchester City midfielder trusts Scotland\u2019s progress under Kerr will prove rather less transient. \u201cTactically, Shelley\u2019s very switched on,\u201d says a 23-year-old who has modelled her game on those of Zinedine Zidane and Kelly Smith. \u201cWhat\u2019s great about this team is that we\u2019re given a lot of freedom, it\u2019s enjoyable and exciting to be part of. We try to build from the back and we want to play a nice brand of football. Sometimes we maybe put ourselves under a bit too much pressure, but we aim to play an attacking style and that\u2019s the risk you take.\u201d Scotland\u2019s change under Kerr is such that Weir describes the difference between now and two years ago when they were thrashed 6-0 by England in the opening match of Euro 2017 as \u201ca totally different ball game\u201d. That defeat proved a salutary lesson. \u201cIt was a tough game, we learned a lot from it and we definitely don\u2019t want a repeat,\u201d says Weir. \u201cWe\u2019ve now got a different manager, different tactics and people like Arsenal\u2019s Kim Little available who weren\u2019t fit for Euro 2017. The whole squad has also been training as full-time professionals for six months and we\u2019re much stronger and more competitive. \u201cIt all makes you a lot more confident for Sunday. England are a top team and we\u2019re not daft, but we\u2019ve shown we can compete against some of the world\u2019s best sides. We\u2019ve got a gameplan; hopefully we can execute it and, as a Scot, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a better international match to win.\u201d Should Weir clinch it courtesy of one of her trademark free-kicks, the Royal Bengal may have to be re-named; Lady Caroline\u2019s anyone?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
