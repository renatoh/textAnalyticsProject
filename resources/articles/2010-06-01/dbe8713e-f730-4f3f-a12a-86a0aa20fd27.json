As well as \"backward\", \"arrogant\" and a few other things. She took the snub well, merely lamenting that it was \"nonsense\" and \"bizarre beyond bizarre\". Others pointed out that other bishops from the US, including her male predecessor, have been allowed to wear their mitres. And now, amid much ecclesiastical, rumbling, and courtesy of the website Episcopal Caf\u00e9, an explanation. The agreed approach of most English bishops, says the archbishop's chaplain in an explanatory letter, is that women bishops appearing as presiding bishop Schori did at Southwark \"should do so without the insignia of episcopal office so as to avoid possible misunderstandings\". Be assured, he says, \"that the archbishop, and those of us who support his ministry, had no intention to slight the presiding bishop. Indeed, by ensuring that the legal formalities were observed it was hoped that she, and the dean of Southwark, might be spared the embarrassment that might have flowed from any challenge to her presiding and preaching at the cathedral. The media interest provoked over the issue of vesture has, of course, undermined that hope.\" I think he's blaming us. Aw shucks. \u2022 Much to do for Baroness Ashton, our woman in Brussels, as she works to create a foreign affairs ministry for the EU. And simultaneously she is acquiring new skills. As we said recently, she'll seek to stop the muttering from Paris by going to a language centre to brush up her French. And now, a gift from the Sarkozy administration: a man to help with the etiquette. For among the officials who will work for her will be Nicolas de La Chevardi\u00e8re de La Grandville, a diplomat who provided similar protocol advice to Sarkozy's previous wife Cecilia. He'll tell her who's who in the great salons of Europe. She'll find him a calling card big enough to take his many names. They'll get along fine. \u2022 One less thing for the president to worry about and, lord knows, he has plenty. Yesterday, after France's World Cup debacle, he held a heart to heart with ageing talisman Thierry Henry. Important stuff. So important that he cancelled meetings he had planned with developmental NGOs to discuss the forthcoming round of G8/G20 summits. They were very unhappy at being bumped so the prez could talk football. But then, who is happy in Paris nowadays? \u2022 All smiles at Wimbledon, where the Queen's very presence nudged Andy Murray into his best performance of recent weeks. She should call Wayne Rooney and tell him to get on with it. And while this was happening where was the boy Charles? At Glastonbury. In the green fields, where all sorts, legal and not so, can be found. \"Support FairTrade,\" shouted one supporter handing the heir a sticker. \"What's this?\" he asked, looking at it askance. \"Support FairTrade,\" repeated his pursuer. \"I already do,\" said Charles, slapping it on his lapel and strolling on. \u2022 Times are certainly changing at the Daily Mail. How else to explain the star sports columnist Martin Samuel drawing on the wisdom of a rap group to bolster his theory that Rooney should indeed pull his finger out. \"Part one of a very, very occasional series entitled Things the England Team Could Learn from Mildly Obscure Hip-Hop Tracks of the Early Nineties,\" wrote Samuel. \"This week: Buggin' Out by A Tribe Called Quest from the album The Low End Theory. 'I never walk the streets, thinking it's all about me. Even though, deep in my heart, it really could be.'\" Is Paul Dacre au fait with a Tribe Called Quest, do you think? And is Melanie Phillips really the rap star Missy Elliott? You never actually see them in the same room. \u2022 The Border Agency has swooped on unauthorised workers and migrants in Cornwall; and the headline on the official press release? \"Officers 'takeaway' staff from a Falmouth restaurant.\" Laugh? How do you even start? diary@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
