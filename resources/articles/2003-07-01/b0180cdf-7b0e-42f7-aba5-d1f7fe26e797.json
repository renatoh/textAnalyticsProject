Visit Amanda Craig's website 1. Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen Witty Lizzie Bennet tries to ensure her sister's happiness and inadvertently causes the rich, snobbish Mr Darcy to fall in love with her. Emma is more perfect a novel, but this is the ultimate romantic comedy. 2. Ayala's Angel by Anthony Trollope The romantic, impoverished Ayala is forced to choose between three men: vulgar, callow or ugly. The ugly suitor's kindness and good sense triumph in a captivating Victorian version of Beauty and the Beast. 3. Cold Comfort Farm by Stella Gibbons Every teenaged girl should receive this at puberty as proof that common sense and the perusal of Vogue is a prerequisite for romantic happiness, no matter how mad and unpromising the family. 4. The Guy Next Door by Meg Cabot Best-known for The Princess Diaries, in this one Cabot creates an entire world of New York journalism and romance through office emails. Funny, clever and pure bliss. 5. The Marrying Game by Kate Saunders Does anyone still marry for money? That is what the beautiful and impoverished Handy sisters are determined to do, cutting a swathe in society with unexpected and hilarious results. 6. The Hearts and Lives of Men by Fay Weldon Weldon is at her best and richest in this story where a divorced couple who lose their child are finally reunited through goodness, compassion and growing wisdom. 7. A Room with a View by EM Forster The story of Lucy Honeychurch's reluctant romance with a working-class intellectual in Tuscany is made even more hilarious by its cast of snooty English characters. 8. Perfect Strangers by Robyn Sisman A shy, preppy American and a bold, chaotic English girl swap jobs, problems and eventually hearts in an utterly engaging, thoroughly amusing transatlantic romance. 9. Harnessing Peacocks by Mary Wesley Single mother Hebe learns to survive and appal her posh relations by becoming a successful prostitute. Naughty, and unexpectedly nice. 10.
