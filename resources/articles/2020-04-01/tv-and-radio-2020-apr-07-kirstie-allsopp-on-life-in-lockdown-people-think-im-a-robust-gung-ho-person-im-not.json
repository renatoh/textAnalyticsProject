I\u2019m not'", "bodyText": "There is a \u201cterrible fight\u201d going on in Kirstie Allsopp\u2019s kitchen. Her two sons, who are 11 and 13, are making a chocolate cake. Allsopp, speaking on the phone, takes a pause to listen out. At least they\u2019re not on screens \u2013 she has been trying, and not always succeeding, to implement a no-screens-before-6pm policy. How is that even possible? \u201cScreaming. Threats. I haven\u2019t resorted to physical violence yet,\u201d she says with a laugh. (In 2018, Allsopp became notorious, briefly, for saying she had smashed her children\u2019s iPads because they were spending too long on them.) Allsopp, 48, has presented the property show Location, Location, Location since 2000. And there are other TV shows, including a property renovation programme, Love It Or List It. She has also become known for shows about home crafts, and is about to begin filming a lockdown crafts special for Channel 4, with a team of 11 who are arriving at her house this week. They have all been in self-isolation for a couple of weeks in preparation \u2013 the channel believes the team can travel and work safely \u2013 and Allsopp has turned her tennis court into a kind of field canteen, where they will all eat together twice a day. She is putting them all up, and somehow, she says, will all observe the physical-distancing rules (yes, her house must be huge). \u201cThat means we\u2019re able to make 10 shows with family crafts that people can do with the stuff they have in their homes,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople should know by now to save the inside of their loo rolls.\u201d She is expecting a bit of a backlash \u2013 making a TV show about crafts may not be considered essential \u2013 but for some, it can relieve some of the pressure of this time, she says. \u201cWe just want to do fun stuff, which people can do with their kids or grandparents \u2013 they can FaceTime or Zoom while doing it. They can make things that they will link together when they meet up, and get through a couple of hours of the day doing something fun together. When you use your hands to make something, you have a sense of achievement. This is a really important thing for mental health \u2013 it gives us some control over an increasingly uncontrollable environment. It\u2019s very therapeutic.\u201d What else is keeping Allsopp sane? \u201cI\u2019m not sure I am staying sane,\u201d she says. Watching Call the Midwife is helping (\u201cIt just reminds us how hard life was\u201d), as is Friends and Frasier. \u201cCooking, tidying and our daily walk at the end of the day. Daffodils and Evan Davies. Knowing I have some work to do next week. Mascara.\u201d She says she knows she has much to be grateful for. \u201cThere\u2019s no point pretending Covid-19 is a great leveller because \u2013 look at me \u2013 I\u2019m not on a par with other people, shut up.\u201d She has a big house and garden, she points out, and no financial problems. \u201cAnyone saying we\u2019re all in this together \u2026 we\u2019re bloody not. There are people who are shut up who have acute money worries, as well as being in small spaces.\u201d But, mentally, Allsopp is finding it a struggle. \u201cPeople think I\u2019m quite a robust, gung-ho type of person \u2026 that I would be responding really well, but I\u2019m not,\u201d she says. She worries about women trapped in abusive homes and children who were already living in deprived circumstances. \u201cAt the moment, I\u2019m feeling completely overwhelmed by the misery that this is causing \u2013 the loss of work, the loss of relationships. People are going to be saying things to each other in their lockdown that they\u2019ll never be able to take back. I worry far more about the economic impact and the effect on those with Aids, TB or malaria in places where those conditions are overwhelming. And the impact on children. In places where life is hard, it will be harder.\u201d It is this that has given her some perspective while dealing with a week of abuse on social media. Her partner, Ben Andersen, a property developer, was diagnosed with Covid-19, and she was criticised online and in the press for taking her family to their house in Devon. She does have a house in London, but insists the family is based in Devon, and that they weren\u2019t escaping the capital for their \u201csecond home\u201d. It blew up on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019ve had some of the most unpleasant things said to me on social media that have ever been said to me.\u201d Devon, she says, \u201cis our home, 100%. It\u2019s the house that Ben had when I met him, and it\u2019s the only place that has been consistent in the lives of my stepchildren.\u201d Andersen has two sons from a previous relationship. \u201cWhen national newspapers use the internet to generate activity \u2013 when they go and look for negative things tweeted about people \u2013 they are bullying and they are generating hatred. Every single day on social media, people have said things to me. It\u2019s becoming less now, but yesterday somebody asked: \u2018Are you dead yet? You brought your vile, infected family to Devon.\u2019\u201d On the whole, she says, she can\u2019t allow herself to indulge in self-pity \u2013 her partner has recovered, the children are healthy, they have money and a home with outdoor space. \u201cI am in a far, far, better situation than 99.9% of the population. It\u2019s just that there will always be people out there who think I did something wrong, and I won\u2019t be able to change that.\u201d Later, she sends me a text apologising for being \u201cso gloomy\u201d. One thing that has changed for the better during this period, she says, is people\u2019s relationships with their neighbours. \u201cI\u2019m seeing stories every day about neighbourhood relations, and if that is the one thing that comes out of this \u2013 people knowing their neighbours \u2013 then that\u2019s enough for me.\u201d I interviewed Allsopp about 15 years ago, and I couldn\u2019t help but like her. She often gets herself into trouble with her pronouncements (that washing machines in the kitchen were \u201cdisgusting\u201d, that women should think about putting off going to university to have children earlier), but I admire her willingness to say what she thinks. If she is privileged in the extreme \u2013 she is the daughter of Charles Allsopp, the sixth Baron Hindlip, and former chairman of Christie\u2019s \u2013 at least she is aware of it. Her late mother, Fiona, an interior designer, was diagnosed with breast cancer when Allsopp was 17, an illness she would live with, on and off, for 25 years until her death in 2014. That shaped Allsopp\u2019s early adulthood, and alongside her experience of being a step-parent \u201cmeans that I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m completely lost in my privilege\u201d. Her job, she thinks \u2013 making TV shows about people looking for their next home \u2013 \u201calso enables me to both relate and be relatable. What my job has given me is something that I would never have had otherwise.\u201d Without spending 20 years seeing how more ordinary people lived, or at least those in a position to buy a house, \u201cI\u2019d have lived in my bubble. It would have been the life of an upper-middle-class country housewife. Who knows? Maybe not. Maybe I\u2019m doing myself an injustice. Maybe I would always have been interested in other people and other people\u2019s lives. I think that going all around the country, seeing houses, it would be good if more members of parliament did what I did.\u201d Allsopp is conspicuously posh \u2013 as in she has never pretended not to be \u2013 and well-connected. Her brother\u2019s godmother is the Duchess of Cornwall, who was a childhood friend of their mother\u2019s. She is careful not to talk about the royal family (\u201cMy mum was always very strict about never talking of any connection\u201d), but says Camilla is \u201ckind and straightforward in a way I appreciate more and more as I get older. I know quite a lot of women who are like her \u2013 they get things done.\u201d She has known David Cameron since they were young, and memorably described a dinner party once at which Michael Gove did some rapping. She has met Boris Johnson \u201cand I do know his sister Rachel\u201d. Are there too many privileged people in public life? She talks instead about education. \u201cMy children are in the independent school sector. I wish that we had [one universal form of] education; I wish that we could sort that out. The headteacher of my stepson\u2019s school wrote an article saying if they made it become a state school, he would rather close it because he felt that the school was independent and could do different things. I absolutely get that, but at the same time I recognise the divide.\u201d She doesn\u2019t make much of an effort to justify her own decision to send her children to private school beyond saying their father hated the London comprehensive they would have gone to (although the school is now rated outstanding). Should private schools be abolished? \u201cI think we should try to find a way,\u201d she says. \u201cThe problem is, it is a divide. It isn\u2019t a good thing, but it is so low on the list [of priorities] and after this it\u2019s going to be even lower.\u201d Allsopp grew up in Berkshire, the eldest of four, although for a long time it was just her and her younger brother. \u201cMy parents worked very hard to give us what they thought was an idyllic childhood. We lived in the middle of the country; we didn\u2019t have any friends whose house we could walk to. It was me and my brother, and I think I was more gregarious than that. I had forgotten about that until this week, and now I feel like I did when I was a child, longing for visitors to come.\u201d She went through several schools, never really settling. \u201cI was a pain in the arse,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cChildren are very conventional, and I wasn\u2019t. Now I probably seem much more conventional than I was as a child, but I\u2019m not a conventional person. And school didn\u2019t work for me.\u201d She has dyslexia, and has seen one of her own children deal with a similar issue. \u201cThe London independent day-school system doesn\u2019t want dyslexics \u2013 it\u2019s all about the academics. And the focus on academic stuff, and the lack of craft, art, drama and music. I struggle with it.\u201d Allsopp\u2019s mother had ME before being diagnosed with breast cancer and so Allsopp had always helped out at home a lot, particularly with her sisters. \u201cI wasn\u2019t dragged kicking and screaming out of a rave to look after my sisters,\u201d she says. \u201cI liked looking after them. I was always very maternal and housey. I went through a stage of thinking maybe if my mother hadn\u2019t been ill, I\u2019d have gone to raves and done lots of E, and had the early 20s that a lot of my contemporaries did, but I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s true any more.\u201d One of her sisters has had a preventive mastectomy, but Allsopp decided against it (\u201cShe was younger and it\u2019s very tough surgery\u201d), even though she says she believes there is between a 50% and 80% chance of her developing breast cancer. It\u2019s not something she worries too much about, she says. \u201cI don\u2019t do health anxiety. I never have, not about myself, Ben or the kids. It may be that there was a lot of it around when I was a teen or I may be missing a chip.\u201d Her 20s, she says, \u201cwere not particularly happy. I was desperate to get married and have a child \u2013 that was all I was interested in. I wasn\u2019t interested in a career. And then what happened to me was incredibly lucky. And also it was my very domesticity which led to my job.\u201d It was the Guardian journalist Jonathan Freedland who inadvertently kicked off Allsopp\u2019s television career \u2013 she was running a property-finding company and found him a flat. He wrote about her in the paper, and a TV production company contacted her and gave her a screen test opposite Phil Spencer, another property agent it had already hired to present the show. She didn\u2019t expect to get the job long-term, but agreed to film the pilot. \u201cThey were paying me \u00a3600 a day! Can you imagine? I was self-employed, and I was paid for three days, plus travel, and they put us in a hotel. Of course I was going to say yes to that. They were going to find proper presenters for the show, obviously.\u201d That was 20 years ago. What does she think Covid-19 will do to the property market? \u201cNo one knows,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve always put a caveat on all my predictions for property: \u2018aside from an unforeseen world event\u2019. Well, that is this.\u201d One of the things this crisis is highlighting, now we are forced to stay at home, is the vast divide in housing. \u201cThere are so many homes that are not fit for purpose,\u201d says Allsopp. \u201cWhat housebuilders have been allowed to get away with \u2026 they just built substandard homes and it will come back to haunt all of us. In our desire to build more homes, we\u2019ve focused on \u2018more\u2019 and not \u2018what\u2019.\u201d She breaks off to listen out for sounds from the kitchen: \u201cShit, that was the Hoover. What have they done? They\u2019d have to make quite a mess to voluntarily get the Hoover out.\u201d Another pause to listen. \u201cIt\u2019s good, they\u2019re learning. There are some benefits to the lockdown. In my lighter moments I can see those.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
