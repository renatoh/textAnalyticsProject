Four European Footballers of the Year on the same pitch: Rivaldo, Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane and Ra\u00fal. (Of course, Ra\u00fal's never won the award, but no matter - according to the Madrid press he's the \"only\" candidate this year). Unfortunately, the derbi couldn't match the hype as Real Madrid squeezed past Barcelona 2-0. It wasn't as \"boring\" as Marca columnist Juli\u00e1n Ruiz claimed (he should try a North London derby), but Sunday's clash was disappointing, especially for the boys with the golden balls. They were all below par, while the derbi's other stars were absent - a sublime back-heel aside, Patrick Kluivert was quiet, Roberto Carlos was injured, and Javier Saviola was, again, on the bench. With the \"cracks\" struggling, it was left to others to take centre stage: local boys Gabri, Xavi and Carles Puyol, were Bar\u00e7a's best, while Madrid's star men were Iker Casillas, Francisco Pav\u00f3n and - who else? - Steve McManaman. Not only did Macca provide the left-footed (yes, left-footed) cross which led to Morientes opening the scoring, but his early switch to the middle of midfield was vital. With Zidane and Makelele unable to control Xavi, Vicente del Bosque proved that he's not just a pretty moustache by pushing Zidane to the left and shifting McManaman inside - a change which saw Madrid take control. But don't take this column's word for it (as if anyone would). AS rated McManaman as \"perfect\" and its editor waxed lyrical: \"It was an ideal game for McManaman, a footballer capable of being everyone's partner, in the middle, up front, at the back\", he said, \"he gets the side playing all over the pitch\". The explosive build-up But if the match - Macca apart - was a let down, the press excelled itself in the point-scoring and mutual stirring stakes. It'd been rumbling for months, but the derbi countdown really exploded into life on Tuesday when AS led with the story - and it was a story - that Kluivert could be on his way to Madrid as well as publishing endless interviews with Real players declaring, \"we always play well against Barcelona\". Beneath the bravado, though, you could sense the anxiety. And it was just about to get worse: on Tuesday night Real Madrid's plane from Moscow had to make an emergency landing after a particularly dumb bird (but more of Jordan later) flew into one of the engines. \"What a fright!\", exclaimed AS's front page, while Marca seized the chance to prepare a few excuses, just in case. They helpfully brought in a psychologist to \"analyse\" the impact. \"This could effect the squad on Sunday\", was his brilliant, and surprising, diagnosis. Worse was to come. On Thursday the Barcelona daily El Mundo Deportivo broke the week's biggest story: \"Rivaldo will play in Madrid\" it claimed. Amazingly, it wasn't made up, so everyone at Madrid had to pretend they didn't care. \"He's just another player\", they lied in unison. Madrid's press responded as best it could. Unfortunately, it didn't have much to go on, so an \"incident\" in training between Kluivert and Fabio Rochemback suffered the kind of inflation normally reserved for Jordan's bust. Marca cunningly published photos of the two (Kluivert and Rochemback, not Jordan's air-bags) arguing alongside some scenes of fun and games at Real Madrid. \"There's tension in Barcelona\", it insisted to anyone who'd listen. But the real tension was in Madrid, courtesy - not for the first time - of Roberto Carlos. He of the Thunder Thighs decided that if Rivaldo was going to play on Sunday, so was he. Trouble was, Roberto was injured - even if, at first, it looked like one of those international-week Ryan Giggs jobs - and was ruled out my Madrid's doctor. Thunder Thighs wasn't happy: \"I'm my best doctor\", he whinged while muttering something about the knee bone being connected to the head bone. \"I feel fine. But someone won't let me play!\". On Sunday, El Mundo Deportivo brought out the big guns - the players' wives. \"Barcelona's women - pretty, fine, and classy - score a thumping victory\", it reported. It seems Chantal Overmars, Angela Kluivert, Roberta de Giovanni and Karen Cocu are \"beauties\", while Manon Reiziger \"is spectacular - one of those who stops the traffic\" (so she's a policewoman, too?). But what of the Madrid squad? As far as El Mundo Deportivo is concerned, since Christian Karembeu left the Bernab\u00e9u and took his Wonderbra-wearing wife with him, Real \"simply can't compete\". Despite the ribbing, the paper strangely passed up the opportunity to mention Guti's ex - an actress who used to be an actor - and begrudgingly conceded that Morientes's wife is \"pretty\" and that Veronique Zidane is \"not bad\". Wait, though, there's time to score one more point: \"The best of the Madrid girls\", claimed the paper, is Luis Figo's wife, Helen, \"and she's from FC Barcelona really\". Some irrelevant stuff to end on ... Believe it or not, there were some other games in Spain this weekend, but no one could seriously claim that league leaders Deportivo's 5-1 victory over Osasuna is more important than Roberto Carlos's knee; that Celta's first defeat - 4-2 against Las Palmas - matters as much as Ra\u00fal's potential Golden Ball; or that Valencia's extension of their unbeaten run is as significant (or as funny) as Guti shacking up with a transvestite.
