After conducting a survey of UK life offices, the financial services authority (FSA) concluded that they held enough assets to absorb unexpected losses and support future new business. \"Life offices have significant ability to withstand further large falls in equity values from the level at which the exercise was commissioned (FTSE-100, around 4,000),\" the FSA said in a report on the overhaul of regulations for the insurance industry. The FSA is looking to strengthen the regulatory framework for the industry after consumer and investor confidence was sapped by instances of mis-selling of pensions in high profile cases such as Equitable Life and Independent Insurance. More recently, insurance companies have been hit by the sharp fall in financial markets. September was one of the worst months in recent market history, with the FTSE-100 shedding 9%. Life assurers in the UK and Europe have been doubly hit by tumbling investment returns and policyholders cashing in prematurely, further weakening their funds. \"Falling equity markets have seen UK and international life insurers' asset values fall sharply,\" the FSA said. \"This has forced some firms to make unpalatable decisions, such as cutting bonuses, increasing exit penalties or withdrawing from some or all parts of the market.\" Standard Life yesterday cut payouts on millions of pensions and endowment policies in the face of tumbling shares. Britain's biggest mutual insurer finally followed the rest of the industry by cutting maturity plans on some policies by 10% and imposing an additional 10% penalty on people wanting to cash in a policy early. Other insurance companies, such as Legal &amp; General, have issued heavily discounted rights - giving shareholders the right to buy shares at a set price - to raise more cash to make up for dwindling assets. Some have even stopped writing new business. The FSA sought to soothe investor nervousness by saying that insurance companies could withstand the current market turmoil. \"In spite of a 16% fall in the FTSE-100 in 2001 and a further 19% fall in the first seven months of 2002, overall we are satisfied that, to date, the insurance industry has been meeting our minimum solvency requirements,\" they said. The FSA's findings came after asking 20 of the largest firms writing with-profits business. With-profit policies allowed the provider to pay some of its investment gains into a pooled fund and then distribute surpluses in the form of bonuses to the policy holder. But the fear among investors is that insurers are caught in a vicious circle of selling to meet their solvency requirements. \"In markets dominated by institutions with market-sensitive risk and solvency limits, such as the UK, the selling has developed a life of its own with price declines triggering further selling,\" said Avinash Persaud, managing director of State Street Bank."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
