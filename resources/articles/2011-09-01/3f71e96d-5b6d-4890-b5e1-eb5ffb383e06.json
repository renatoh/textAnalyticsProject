A suggestion of foundation, a greyish smear of eyeliner. Perhaps a glob of mascara, but not where you'd expect it. There's a trick to making your make-up stay on all day though, and it's \"yet more make-up\". I'll explain. A dusting of Laura Mercier's Invisible Loose Setting Powder (\u00a329, spacenk.co.uk) with a big blusher brush when you're just about to leave the house will fix your face for the whole day. Keep it light, so it doesn't look ashy or powdery, just leaves a soft matte texture \u2013 I want to say flawless, but I know that's pushing it. If you have dry skin and don't like powders, Mac's spritz (Fix+ Spray, \u00a312.50, maccosmetics.co.uk) works nicely, and keeps you looking a little bit dewy, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
