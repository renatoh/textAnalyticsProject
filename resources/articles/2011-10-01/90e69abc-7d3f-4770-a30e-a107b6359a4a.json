Rebel jockeys, not yet striking, have won their first victory against the evil British Horseracing Authority. During the battle, jockeys managed to thwart either much-discussed or secret plans to implement the Authority's ultimate weapon, the NEW WHIP RULES, reputed to wield enough power to destroy an entire sport. Think Ruby Walsh for Han Solo. Perhaps Kevin Darley, the Professional Jockeys Association chief executive, isn't the best Luke Skywalker, but roles on the Dark Side pick themselves. That the BHA's stand on an emotive issue is now a power struggle was evident in the rhetoric of Shane Kelly on Channel 4's The Morning Line. The rider, whose year-long ban for passing information for reward in 2007 may jaundice his view, asked: \"Who are the BHA? Why are we bending to so many different rules?\" The personal journey of his colleague Nicky Mackay is also telling. On day one of the new rules, he used one strike fewer than allowed, wary of the limit, and believed his winning horse responded because of his restraint. On day 12, he exceeded it by two strokes, opining: \"I felt I wouldn't have won if I hadn't kept riding to the line.\" Mackay's evolved defiance came on the day concessions sought by the PJA were implemented. Yet bans keep coming and a militant mood has settled in the weighing room. To an extent, perhaps some have already given up trying to adapt to these 16-day-old rules. For belief has taken hold that the BHA has been caught in a reckless bluff, namely that public opinion was neither weighty nor informed enough to require changes to the old whip rules. Walsh cited as proof the fact that, under the old rules, less than 1% of rides resulted in whip offences. The jockeys' stance is also informed by the memory-foam whip they all must use. Unlike the wider public, to the discredit of the BHA, riders know it is designed so as not to inflict pain on a horse. The BHA should aspire to enforcing the link between whip misuse and inferior riding. In practice, its new rules have required riders to be more circumspect with the whip and yet they also proved an undiscerning filter. As the former champion Ryan Moore argues, 20 strikes of the whip, in skilful hands, can constitute a good ride but merely one ill-judged strike a bad ride. If Walsh's ride is anything to go by, the amended rules and penalties are no keener tools. Trouble awaits this winter because the longer the race and softer the ground, especially over fences, the more likely whip bans are to occur. Can the BHA bend on this point without inflicting the fatal blow to its credibility? Perhaps both sides can agree it would be an unalloyed positive if the BHA targeted counterproductive, mechanical and needless whip use \u2013 those who habitually reach for the whip as first resort or carry on using it beyond the point of constructiveness. Jockeys speak of counselling young riders on this subject and endorse throwing the book at those who misuse the whip, yet their instinctive solidarity means they \u2013 and others \u2013 fail publicly to condemn, even when bad habits tip over into breaches. For example, recent upscale whip offences by Paul McMahon, Charles Eddery and Kieren Fox have not attracted reproach, risking undeserved elision with rides like Walsh's and muddying the finer points of that specific debate. Yet the BHA is also dodging the issue. Until it spends as much time and money on education and retraining as it has on public opinion and punishment, the force will never be with it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
