The storms also caused thousands of flight delays on one of the busiest travel days of the year. The National Weather Service said on Thursday that there was a diminished risk of severe storms as search and rescue efforts were underway in regions that endured the most significant storm and tornado damage. At least seven people were killed in the state of Mississippi and at least three in Tennessee, officials said. Mississippi governor Phil Bryant declared a state of emergency on Thursday. \u201cMississippians are resilient in difficult times, and we will meet this challenge head on for those that are in need,\u201d Bryant said in a statement. Michaela Remus, 18, died in Arkansas after a tree crashed into her bedroom, according to the Pope County sheriff\u2019s office. Remus\u2019s one-year-old sister was sleeping in the bedroom with her but rescuers were able to pull her from the home. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible that this happened, especially at Christmas,\u201d said Pope county sheriff Shane Jones. Thousands of people lost power from Mississippi to Michigan during the storms. Though the risk for severe storms diminished in the south, forecasters warned of a lingering chance of flash flooding, heavy rains and winds. Officials said a seven-year-old boy died in Holly Springs, Mississippi when a tornado swept through the city and tossed over the car he was in. Two people were also killed and two others were missing in nearby Benton County. In Tennessee, a 22-year-old man died in Rhea County and a 70-year-old man and 69-year-old woman died in Perry County. Mississippi Emergency Management Agency spokesman Greg Flynn said that the agency had recorded more than 40 injuries, including amputations, before dawn on Thursday. In the communities hit hardest by Wednesday\u2019s tornadoes, search parties hunted for missing people and volunteers helped clear debris. Bobby Watkins and his wife huddled beneath their old oak dining table for shelter as storm winds roaring outside their rural Mississippi home tossed a barn onto their truck outside, tore the steeple off a nearby church and reduced a neighbouring building to rubble. \u201cSanta brought us a good one, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Watkins said on Thursday, as the couple took a Christmas Eve stroll amid the destruction. \u201cI may have lost some stuff, but I got my life.\u201d In Linden, in the state of Tennessee, Chris Shupiery wore a Santa hat as he cut fallen trees with a chain saw not far from a home in which two people died in the storm. \u201cI figured I\u2019d come down here with my hat,\u201d Shupiery said. \u201cI\u2019ve been wearing it for Christmas, and this was just the right thing to do, come help a family in need.\u201d Authorities in Alabama\u2019s Pike County asked drivers to stay off the road until Monday after 10 inches of rain poured down on the southeast part of the state. In Georgia, heavy rains caused a mudslide and several roads were overwhelmed by flooding. More than 4,200 flights were delayed nationwide and 550 flights had been canceled as of Thursday afternoon, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware. Meanwhile, the record-setting east coast temperatures mean that New York City could experience a warmer Christmas than Los Angeles. Washington DC reported a record-setting tropical air stream, prompting flash flood warnings for the metro area and Baltimore. Wet weather conditions in California provided short term relief for the drought-stricken state. The snowpack in the Sierra Nevadas is also higher than average for the first time in several years, but the increased snowfall there and in Utah increases the chance of avalanches. The snowpack needs to be significantly higher for the drought to be over. Steve Nemeth, water supply forecaster for California\u2019s department of water resources said that levels were good, but cautioned that the December increase may not last through the winter. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fooled before on above-average Decembers,\u201d Nemeth told the LA Times. The threat of tornadoes eased as the line of storms moved eastwards on Thursday and brought heavy rain and thunderstorms to Atlanta, in Georgia and both North and South Carolina. The threat of severe weather in that area of the US just before Christmas is unusual, but not unprecedented, said Greg Carbin, a meteorologist at the national Storm Prediction Centre. Exactly a year ago, tornadoes hit south eastern Mississippi, killing five people and injuring dozens of others."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
