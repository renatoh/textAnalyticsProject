Showers were closed across the site as a precautionary measure to preserve water as temperatures soared and the festival\u2019s management coped with the demands of 200,000 people requiring drinking water in challenging conditions. After rumours circulated that water was running out, organisers released a statement on Saturday afternoon to reassure the crowd that there were adequate supplies. \u201cThere is not a water shortage at this year\u2019s Glastonbury. Our supply is running as normal,\u201d the statement read. \u201cAs always in hot weather, demand for water has increased, so we have put in place the usual restrictions on staff and guest showers and the limited number of public showers.\u201d The statement confirmed that the festival\u2019s onsite ambulance team has had 27 heat-related calls for assistance during the event so far, and that queues should be expected at some taps. Waiting in a queue of more than 100 people to refill their water bottles late on Saturday morning, Paulina Wilkin from London said she preferred a bit of rain at the festival. \u201cI always think that until it rains it\u2019s a real fashion show and you need the rain to level everybody out, so I\u2019ve missed the rain a bit.\u201d Her partner, Adam, was not so sure. Ultimately extreme heat is better than the rain, he said. \u201cWhen it rains a lot you can\u2019t sit down and you\u2019re just walking and walking and walking. And then it\u2019s queues for the wellies and not queues for the water.\u201d Free sun lotion and a record number of water stations were just part of the contingency plans the festival organisers put in place earlier in the week as the dreary June weather transformed into a balmy and hot weekend in Somerset. Temperatures on Friday hit 27C as Stormzy made history by becoming the first solo black British act to headline the Pyramid stage. Saturday night saw The Killers top the bill at the Pyramid stage with Liam Gallagher, the Chemical Brothers and Janet Jackson also performing at the festival\u2019s halfway point. The Cure are the final headline act on Sunday night, with Kylie Minogue and Miley Cyrus also taking to the Pyramid stage. Business at ice-cream vans across the site was booming. \u201cI\u2019ve never worked at Glastonbury before, but I\u2019ve worked other festivals and we are very, very busy,\u201d said one ice-cream seller. He said that most people were buying ice lollies and drinks, with the fruit pastille lolly the most popular. There are 800 water taps on site and mobile water units, with 37 WaterAid kiosks giving out water and bottles. Free sun cream was also available at information points and property lockups, and the festival said extra shaded areas would be opened if needed. Sunday is expected to be cooler, with a maximum 23C predicted. The Met Office and NHS England issued a level two alert for the heat, suggesting that people who are vulnerable should stay out of the sun when it\u2019s at its hottest. This year Glastonbury has installed a plastic-free system, so no single-use plastic can be bought on site. The move was motivated by the desire to save on clean-up costs, with the final bill for the removal of rubbish from the site estimated at \u00a3785,000. In 2017, the last time the festival was held, visitors used 1.3 million plastic bottles. The festival previously banned food traders from using plastic plates and cutlery, requesting compostable alternatives instead. Glastonbury\u2019s wristbands are made of cloth, single-use plastic cups are not used in the bars and only paper straws are available."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
