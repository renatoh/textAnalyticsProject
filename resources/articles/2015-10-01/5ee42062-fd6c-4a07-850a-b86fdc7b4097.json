The Manchester United captain was only brought on at half-time, then he assumed responsibility for the first penalty in the shootout and fluffed it. It would be unfair to pin all the blame for United\u2019s Capital One Cup elimination to a Championship side on a single player, Michael Carrick and Ashley Young also failed from the spot, but the home side had been unconvincing as an attacking force all night and Rooney\u2019s only notable contribution to the contest was hardly what his manager would have been expecting. Middlesbrough, who knocked Manchester City out of the FA Cup at the Etihad last season, were good value for the win, if only for defending resolutely and keeping their nerve in the shootout. David Nugent skied the next effort after Rooney had seen Tom\u00e1s Mej\u00edas save his opening attempt, but successful kicks from Grant Leadbitter, Stewart Downing and Ben Gibson saw them through. \u201cPenalties can go either way but we felt we were the better team in open play,\u201d said Middlesbrough\u2019s manager, Aitor Karanka, not unfairly. \u201cI am proud because our overall performance was amazing.\u201d Louis van Gaal did not dispute the justice of the result. \u201cOur penalty takers were not so sharp after 120 minutes, but we had plenty of chances before that,\u201d the United manager said. \u201cI am concerned that we have not scored in our last two games. We could have scored in the game against Manchester City, but it is goals that win matches, not the number of chances created.\u201d The first half simply proved that United can be just as turgid and unimaginative when Rooney is sitting watching as when he is playing. Boro began to break forward after a while and ended up creating the first attempt on goal. George Friend nutmegged Jesse Lingard to win a corner, and when United failed to clear Leadbitter\u2019s returned ball found Friend unmarked at the far post, only for the full-back to shoot straight at Sergio Romero. Still, together with 10,000 visiting fans illuminating their end of the ground with mobile phones in a photogenic gesture of support for former Teesside steelworkers, it was clear Boro intended to make their presence felt. By the half-hour mark the visitors were doing most of the attacking and all the chanting, growing into the game as United retreated into their shell. Lingard showed the occasional flourish on the ball, looking more of a threat than Memphis Depay on the opposite flank, though Andreas Pereira and Marouane Fellaini offered little thrust in central midfield and there was no real width to United\u2019s play. Despite a lack of clear-cut opportunities both sides had chances to take the lead late-on in the first half. Fellaini seemed certain to score when Gibson failed to cut out a cross and he controlled the ball with his chest on the six-yard line only for Friend to throw himself in the way of the shot, while at the other end Downing spied a chance from the edge of the penalty area and found Romero equal to it with a fingertip save. The upshot was that Van Gaal was able to send on Rooney for the second half to applause, presumably from the same people who have been grumbling that he is past it. Nothing happened. Mej\u00edas fumbled a shot from Depay and got away with it, then comfortably got behind efforts from Pereira and Fellaini, but it was Boro who came closest to scoring, albeit from an offside position. Kike hit the post with an angled shot and the Boro fans thought they had gone ahead when Daley Blind could only turn the rebound into his own net, though despite the heated protests Lee Mason was quite right, the linesman had his flag raised the whole time. United had a let-off when Romero allowed a backpass under a foot and was relieved to see it roll inches wide, before Van Gaal decided enough was enough and sent on Anthony Martial for the disappointingly lightweight Depay for the last 20 minutes. United at least spent the final part of normal time on top, yet Martial was peripheral out on the left and for all their pressing the home side could not find a way through. Lingard had a shot saved at the death, but Leadbitter passed up an even better opportunity in trying to chip Romero in the closing seconds. United made a few positional changes for extra time, moving Martial to the centre, withdrawing Rooney to deep midfield and sending Fellaini further forward. Fellaini missed a close-range header from Pereira\u2019s cross in the first period, unsuccessfully claiming he was shoved by Friend, then in the second period Martial looked to have found space for a shot with a smart turn but was expertly shut out by Gibson and Daniel Ayala. That was it for incident until first Martial then Fellaini missed with takeable headers right at the end. Boro were in conservation mode by then. United, goalless in the last 210 minutes at Old Trafford, could probably have played all night without scoring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
