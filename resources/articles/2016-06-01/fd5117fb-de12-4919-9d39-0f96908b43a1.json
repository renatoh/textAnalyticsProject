Featuring Prince-inspired slow jams, bluesy confessionals and, on the airy Same Ol\u2019 Mistakes, a cover of Australian psych-rockers Tame Impala, it was an album that flashed Rihanna\u2019s artistic credentials in big neon letters. It\u2019s testament to her talent and charisma, then, that this potentially worthy side-step into mature album artist territory hasn\u2019t diminished her pop-star power. Watching her stalk around tonight\u2019s minimal stage setup, she still looks like she\u2019s having a ball, playfully flicking the finger at fans and relishing every pose during a brilliantly ragged Bitch Better Have My Money. As with its parent album, the Anti world tour (which has already wrapped up 42 dates across America) is a statement as much as it is a piece of entertainment. Eschewing the lasers, pyrotechnics and Day-Glo fashions of previous tours, things are kept relatively low-key; the stage is basically two large light boxes joined by a floating bit of Perspex, while the muted outfits seem to take inspiration from Kanye\u2019s all-beige-everything Yeezy line. If the general mise en sc\u00e8ne doesn\u2019t convince people this era represents a new side to Rihanna, then opening the show with a ballad \u2013 2013\u2019s maudlin Stay \u2013 hammers it home. Climbing on to a small stage in the middle of the stadium, sporting something between a dressing gown and a boxer\u2019s robe, it\u2019s delivered with her face covered by a giant hood. The coyness doesn\u2019t last long, mind you. By the time the lurching drone of Woo and the brazen Sex With Me are over, she\u2019s already prowling around the main stage like a panther. Peppered throughout the Anti album tracks \u2013 including a rib-rattling Desperado and the yearning new single Needed Me \u2013 are a selection of those gold-plated hits, albeit dashed out as medleys. A selection of her collaborations, for example, are sandwiched together midway through the set, but are over just as the crowd have finished roaring their arrival. All is forgiven, however, when the still-imperious Umbrella crashes in and takes things skywards; \u201cLondon what the fuck is up?!\u201d her reasonable reaction when it crashes to a close. Often Rihanna dances and sings along to her older songs in the same way most of her fans do \u2013 smile on her face, arms outstretched, singing the bits she remembers (We Found Love is basically a crowd singalong). It\u2019s easy to ignore this disconnect, because she still imbues them with her unshakeable Rihanna-ness; that perfect pop voice, the undeniable presence, that couldn\u2019t-give-a-shit attitude. The difference now is that she has a handful of emotional new songs in which the connection between song and subject is undeniable. So the closing trio of campfire singalong FourFiveSeconds, the bluesy Love on the Brain and the dramatic sweep of Kiss It Better are delivered with such conviction it feels like you\u2019re watching a different artist. It\u2019s not perfect, but then that\u2019s never been Rihanna\u2019s MO. It\u2019s the imperfections that make her."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
