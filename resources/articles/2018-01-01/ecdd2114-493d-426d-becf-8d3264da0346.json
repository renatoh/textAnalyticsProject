They train three times a week, even during the off season. Each arrival is greeted with a round of handshakes and a wary glance at our camera. During a week in which prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said he was \u201cvery concerned at the growing gang violence and lawlessness in Victoria\u201d; federal health minister Greg Hunt said \u201cAfrican gang crime in some areas ... is clearly out of control\u201d; and home affairs minister Peter Dutton said people in Melbourne were \u201cscared to go out to restaurants\u201d because of \u201cAfrican gang violence\u201d, the team is understandably cautious about media attention. It won the state league division five south premiership in 2017 and boasts some of the most talented players in the league, but that\u2019s not the reason journalists like us come to visit. We\u2019re here because the club \u2013 from its 40 members to its executive board \u2013 is of South Sudanese heritage. And, according to Victoria police deputy commissioner Shane Patton, so are the \u201cyoung thugs\u201d who make up the \u201cstreet gangs\u201d that have dominated media coverage in Melbourne over the traditionally quiet Christmas and New Year period. It has been a frustrating week, says club secretary Maji Maji. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to prove that we are good people,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are just a soccer club.\u201d Media reports about crimes committed by \u201cAfrican gangs\u201d have led to increased scrutiny of the community. Ever since the brawl at the Moomba festival in March 2016, the club leadership says, they have been stopped more frequently by police and accused by people of being gang members. Even the team has been profiled, facing racial taunts on and off the field. One player received a five-year ban and a $5,000 fine during a previous season for kicking a bin as he walked off the field during half-time after players from the opposing team made racist remarks. There have also been times when they have received up to $10,000 in fines for similar low-level infractions. With no government funding or corporate sponsorship, the club is one big penalty away from folding. Yet it is providing exactly the kind of activity that police and the Victorian government say is needed to keep young men of Sudanese background off the streets and engaged in the community. \u201cThey\u2019re here three or four times a week, they go home, they\u2019re too tired to act out,\u201d Latjor Reath, one of the club\u2019s managers, says. \u201cThey [the government] should be supporting us, not trying to start new programs from scratch.\u201d Criminals by association People born in Sudan and South Sudan account for just 0.14% of Victoria\u2019s population. Many of the teenagers linked to the now defunct Apex gang, which was blamed for the Moomba brawl, and its successor Menace to Society (MTS), were born in Melbourne and are Australian citizens. National media coverage of crime in Melbourne, elevated over three high-profile events in December, created the perception that gang violence was rampant and growing. Neither of those assertions are true, Victoria police say. While there is a real problem with young people of African appearance committing crimes in the city, there has been no discernible increase in the level of criminal activity and people of the African diaspora are responsible only for a fraction of the crime in the state. But by identifying groups such as MTS as a gang, a category Patton reluctantly agreed to on Tuesday when he said a small group of \u201cyoung thugs\u201d were on certain occasions \u201cbehaving like street gangs\u201d, the problem seems bigger and all-inclusive. Richard Deng, a spokesman from the Sudanese community in Melbourne\u2019s western suburbs, says there\u2019s a tendency to assume that any group of people of Sudanese appearance is a gang. \u201cThese are teenagers, they\u2019re 14, 13, who are just going about in a number,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cSitting in a park, completely with nothing, we call them a gang. That is not right.\u201d He gestures to our group of three, sitting on a couch in the foyer of the office block where he works as a federal government bureaucrat. \u201cAre we a gang?\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re not a gang. But if we were seeing three young Africans walking together, automatically we would say they are a gang ... we should not be defining a group of young people going together on a school holiday as gangs, that is too much.\u201d Buomkuoth Bol, an emerging hip-hop artist under the name BK Lawd, who has converted one room of the Noble Park home he shares with his brothers into a recording studio, says media reports of violence involving people of African descent often assume a relationship between people who just happen to be in the same place. \u201cI go to St Kilda beach and when I go there, I don\u2019t know every African person that I see,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we\u2019re not a gang. We just say \u2018hi\u2019 to them and shake their hand because that\u2019s our culture \u2026 if I see a group of white people sitting together, I don\u2019t assume they all know each other. I don\u2019t assume that\u2019s a gang.\u201d He and Jeremiah Chuol, a volunteer youth mentor who coached for the Black Rhinos basketball program in Dandenong, say they are frequently targeted by police. It was worse about 10 years ago, they said, before the police lost a racial profiling case against two African-Australian men and developed cultural awareness policies and training to interact with the Sudanese people. They recall a party in Springvale in 2010 when \u201chundreds\u201d of police, including riot police and the dog squad, arrived after a few revellers got into a fight. \u201cAll you could see is dogs coming through the smoke [from police flares],\u201d Chuol said. \u201cI was thinking: these dogs are not on leashes, who are they here for, who are they here to arrest? Everyone was just running, girls were pepper sprayed, it was the most disgusting thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Compare that, he said, with the response to an out-of-control house party thrown in 2008 by then 16-year-old Australian teenager Corey Worthington, who went on to become a media sensation, appeared in season eight of Big Brother, and is said to be returning to reality TV in the coming season of Australian Ninja Warrior. The party that made Worthington famous happened just down the street from Chuol in Narre Warren. He says the idea that a similar out-of-control party at his house would be embraced as an example of Australian larrikinism is laughable. Police have since made a concerted effort to work with the South Sudanese, and Chuol says he now knows several \u201cgood cops\u201d who are keen to help out. Victoria police commander Russell Barrett said the police were working hard to build relationships with the South Sudanese and cultural awareness among officers, and were holding regular forums to meet with community leaders. In a statement to Guardian Australia, Barrett said the police understood that some groups had been affected by the recent media coverage about youth crime, and acknowledged the work done by African community leaders to \u201ctackle the drivers of offending.\u201d \u201cThe vast majority of the African community, irrespective of their ages, are respectable and law-abiding people,\u201d he said. \u201cA small number are operating as street gangs. We acknowledge that the African-Australian community is just as shocked as the broader community in relation to the incidents we\u2019ve seen recently.\u201d Victoria Police has 10 multicultural and emerging community liaison officers who work with the Sudanese people and others, and had a \u201czero tolerance policy towards racial profiling\u201d. Some South Sudanese, such as Nelly Yoa, say the \u201cpolitically correct\u201d approach taken by the police is not working. Yoa says police and the Andrews government have \u201chidden\u201d from the issue of gang violence, and \u201cthe issue would have been solved\u201d if a more hardline approach had been taken earlier. Yoa wrote an opinion piece for Fairfax Media on Tuesday, criticising the police for their reluctance to call groups such as MTS a \u201cgang\u201d (it has subsequently been claimed that parts of the piece were plagiarised, which Yoa denies). \u201cWe have a problem,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe have to solve it, and we have to solve it without falling into political correctness. At the end of a day, a spade is a spade and we need to call it as it is. We need to be honest for the good of the South Sudanese community.\u201d But despite assurances from the police, Yoa says being racially profiled by them has become \u201cthe norm\u201d even for law-abiding people of South Sudanese descent. Officials and players at Sandown Lions say they have learned not to react when they feel they are being unfairly targeted by police, or when white workmates comment on their new car by saying, \u201cdid you steal it?\u201d. \u201cYou are black, you are violent, you are a thief,\u201d one player says. \u201cWhen we are doing something good, we are Australian,\u201d Reath adds. \u201cWhen we are doing something bad, we are Sudanese.\u201d \u2018Send them home\u2019 Reath has been in Australia for 10 years. Many of the young men at the soccer club, who range from 16 to 30 years of age, were born in Australia. He considers himself Australian \u2013 or would, if people didn\u2019t keep telling him he was Sudanese. \u201cHow long do we have to be here to be considered Australian?\u201d he says. \u201c30 years? 40? If our kids are born here, are they still Sudanese?\u201d Nyadol Nyuon arrived in Australia as an 18-year-old in 2005 and works as a commercial litigation lawyer at Melbourne law firm Arnold Bloch Leibler. Her children and her sister\u2019s children consider themselves Australian, she says, because they are. They have not known anywhere else. \u201cThey see themselves only as Australians; they happen to be black,\u201d she says. She says the conflation of people of South Sudanese descent with gang crime is hurtful because it not only associates people who look like her and her children with criminality, but also draws a line between them and the rest of Australian society. \u201cIt isolates community members and makes them think they are not part of the society, and actually that they can never become part of the society, because somehow their citizenship or their stay in Australia is constantly up for negotiation,\u201d she says. \u201cYou are an Australian until a South Sudanese person commits an offence and then you are a South Sudanese-Australian, who is likely to be a potential criminal.\u201d Deng says labelling children born in Australia as Sudanese or South Sudanese is \u201cnot helpful\u201d. \u201cThey are Australian,\u201d he says. \u201cTheir mothers are here, their families are here. They don\u2019t know much about Africa, but we call them African.\u201d Nyuon and Deng have received racial abuse after speaking up in support of their people. Deng has had calls to his office, telling him that as a public servant he should not criticise comments made by senior federal ministers. After appearing on ABC panel show The Drum on Tuesday, Nyuon stayed up until 2am \u201cjust blocking people who were saying really very racist comments\u201d. \u201cThe online racism \u2013 it\u2019s so bad it\u2019s overwhelming,\u201d she says. Each new report of apparent African gang crime brings forth a wave of social media commentary calling for suspected gang members and their families to be deported, dealt with by vigilante groups, or even lynched. \u201cAnytime that I choose to speak, every time that I want to say something publicly, I have to decide whether I am ready to deal with the bigoted and the racist backlash,\u201d Nyuon says. \u201cIt is stifling.\u201d Back at Ross Reserve, the players are packing up. They made it through the 2017 season without a red card and are aiming to hit the same target in 2018. \u201cWe have said to them, if a rival player threatens you, we would rather you were replaced by another player than respond and do something,\u201d club president Dech Top says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who starts it, it will always be blamed on the Sudanese player. It\u2019s not worth it.\u201d This story was amended on 8 January 2018 to remove material relating to Nelly Yoa that could not be independently verified, and to note the allegation that his opinion piece contained plagiarism."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
