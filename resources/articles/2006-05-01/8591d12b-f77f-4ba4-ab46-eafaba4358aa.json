Don't be so naive about 7/7", "bodyText": "'A hidden limitation of intelligence is its inability to transform a mystery into secret,' wrote Lord Butler in his report into the intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. 'The enemy's order of battle may not be known, but it is knowable. The enemy's intentions may not be known, but they are knowable. But mysteries are essentially unknowable.' He sounds like George Smiley at his most opaque, but the point he is supporting is that intelligence seldom acquires the full story. 'It is often, when first acquired, sporadic and patchy and, even after analysis, still may be, at best, inferential.' Most of us agreed with that judgment after it became clear that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction and presented almost no threat whatsoever. There was a lot of comment when the Butler report was published in July 2004 which was devoted to the unreliability of intelligence and of spies in general, and which questioned the wisdom and motivation of politicians who believed them. But when it came to the July 7 London bombing reports published last week by the Intelligence and Security Committee and by the Home Office, an entirely different standard was suddenly applied, characterised by the question: 'Why didn't the security services act on intelligence about Mohammad Siddique Khan and Shahzad Tanveer, the principal movers in the July plot?' The press is having it both ways: it must be illogical in one set of circumstances to condemn the credulity of intelligence officers while in another to attack them for not acting on every piece of information received, however peripheral it seems. Having sat through the inquiry into David Kelly's death and read Lord's Hutton's report with disbelief, I am disposed to a sceptical line on government reports. But the two accounts of the 7 July bombings and the intelligence failure do not have the glare of whitewash, nor the slightest glimmer of it. They seem to provide an accurate picture of what happened and the difficulties faced by the security services and Special Branch. What Siddique Khan and his three companions planned was essentially unknowable. MI5 might conceivably have got closer to the bombers, but, given the enormous number of leads it has to follow up and its finite resources, it would have been extremely lucky to have frustrated this attack as well as three subsequent plots, all of which are now sub judice Clearly, there was a failure, but that alone does not merit the public inquiry that is being called for by people who understandably want some kind of closure to the awful events that wrecked their lives. Public inquiries are not intended to provide closure, other than the satisfaction - or, at least, hope - that failings of government or an agency have been exposed and will be rectified as a result. I guess that is being done and, oddly enough, I did not for one moment sense the complacency that the Daily Telegraph saw in some of MI5's responses: 7 July was a devastating defeat for MI5's director general, Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller, but it was one that could have been expected, given the scale of the challenge and the nature of intelligence work. By July last year, the 'primary investigative targets' known to the security services in the United Kingdom had risen from about 250 at the time of 9/11 to 800. That is 800 individuals who are, perhaps, living very much the same sort of lives as the four young men who perpetrated the attacks on London transport - attending Friday prayers, going into huddles, spending too much time on the internet, drifting in and out of jobs, playing cricket and football, working out and losing weight and maybe visiting Pakistan. That is hardly a profile that defines men who are about to murder 52 people and injure hundreds. True, clues were missed on Siddique Khan and Tanveer, particularly in Pakistan, but in the year that they travelled there and stayed for two months, some 400,000 visits were made by UK residents to Pakistan, for an average of 41 days. When Siddique Khan and Tanveer returned and began to plan their attack, they went by the al-Qaeda book. They used their mobile phones judiciously; Siddique Khan, at least, appears to have taken rudimentary countersurveillance measures; and when they ordered the components of the bombs, they kept below the radar by trading them on the internet for consignments of perfume. The Intelligence and Security Committee report rather portentously talks of the importance of information about the facilitating and funding of terrorist activities, in recognition that it 'can be critical in identifying the next plot'. True, but in this case, there was no money trail to be followed. The four men simply used their credit cards and built up overdrafts, knowing that they wouldn't have to pay off their debts. There was no facilitating by outside parties, aside from the instruction gained in Pakistan six months before. In short, these men were terrifyingly self-sufficient. We do not know the number of people that MI5 can field in a full surveillance operation, but to monitor a group of four men living in different locations would take at least 40 or 50 watchers, as well as various other experts. When the level of threat is judged to be high, this number would be much, much larger, but without that critical and rare intelligence, it is very difficult for MI5 to make that judgment, particularly if you have 800 primary investigative targets, a fraction of which would exhaust your resources. It is natural for people to be sceptical. The security services rarely have to answer for their actions, and the hearings of the Intelligence and Security Committee, which are held in secret, hardly fill one with confidence. But on this occasion, I think it is worth taking both reports at face value, for the very simple reason that the problems involved in detecting young fanatics who want to blow up their fellow citizens must be obvious to anyone. The press - for it is usually newspapers that drive these things - needs to take a more balanced view of the innate difficulties that this particular threat poses. Why? The Intelligence and Security Committee answers the question in paragraph 144 of the report: 'If we seek greater assurance against the possibility of attacks, some increase in intrusive activity by the United Kingdom's intelligence and security agencies is the inevitable consequence. Even then, it seems highly unlikely that it will be possible to stop all attacks.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
