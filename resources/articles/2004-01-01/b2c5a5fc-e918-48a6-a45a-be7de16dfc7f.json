The England coach Sir Clive Woodward will announce his Six Nations squad next month and his options behind are being tested with the centre Mike Tindall out of the opening two matches, the utility back Mike Catt still unsure when he will play again and the outside-half Jonny Wilkinson having played just 53 minutes since the World Cup. The scrum-half Matt Dawson started his comeback from a calf injury for Northampton last night in a development match against Leicester having, like Wilkinson, made one start since the World Cup. Wilkinson is more concerned about getting back on to the pitch than whether he will be asked to take over from Martin Johnson as the England captain. \"I've got to get back playing because I have a long way to go before I can even talk about England squads, let alone the captaincy,\" said Wilkinson, who will only have one chance to prove his fitness ahead of the championship opener against Italy on February 15 after Newcastle were knocked out of the Parker Pen Challenge Cup over the weekend. The France coach Bernard Laporte has problems with his four World Cup locks - Jerome Thion, Fabien Pelous, David Auradou and Olivier Brouzet - on the treatment table."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
