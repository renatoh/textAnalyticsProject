Such was the case with this Barbican semi-staging of Weber\u2019s gothic masterpiece, derived from a production by Compagnie 14:20, seen in Caen and Paris earlier this year. It certainly had its fair share of flaws. Laurence Equilbey conducted her period instrument Insula Orchestra in an interpretation, which, despite moments of wayward intonation and ensemble, carefully emphasised the originality of Weber\u2019s orchestration. But it was short on dramatic momentum and cumulative tension. What remained of Compagnie 14:20\u2019s production, meanwhile, alternately fascinated and distracted. The cast were in costume, and the chorus, Equilbey\u2019s excellent Accentus, wore formal black. Olivier Fredj\u2019s direction was straightforward, though the demonic Samiel, played by dancer and juggler Cl\u00e9ment Dazin, was omnipresent, hovering continuously round the singers, even when the music demanded stillness, and toying with the glass baubles representing Kaspar\u2019s magic bullets. There were, however, astonishing central performances from Stanislas de Barbeyrac as Max and Johanni van Oostrum as Agathe, truly outstanding singers with major careers ahead of them on this showing. De Barbeyrac\u2019s vocal weight, easy top notes and sweetness of tone are well nigh ideal in this music, and he\u2019s a fine actor, conveying Max\u2019s emotional and moral agony with wonderful subtlety. Van Oostrum sounded glorious in Leise, Leise and floated exquisite pianissimos in Und ob Die Wolke: this is an exceptionally beautiful voice. The rest of the cast weren\u2019t quite in their league, though Chiara Skerath made a spirited \u00c4nnchen and Christian Immler was sonorous and superbly majestic as the Hermit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
