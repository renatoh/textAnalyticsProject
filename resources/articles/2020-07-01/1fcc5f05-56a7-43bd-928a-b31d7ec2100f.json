The sisters, who are regarded as Team GB\u2019s best female gymnastics medal hopes at next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics, said they had faced \u201can environment of fear and mental abuse\u201d, with constant questioning of their weight and attitude, as well as a level of over-training so severe their bodies repeatedly broke down. Ellie Downie, who in 2017 became the first British gymnast to win a major all-around title at the European championships, revealed she would not eat or drink the night before weigh-in day and was once told by a coach that she \u201choped the painkillers I was holding for an injury were diet pills\u201d. She added: \u201cThe never-ending focus about my weight will leave scars which will never be healed, I suspect.\u201d Reflecting on their early experiences in the sport, both sisters said: \u201cWe certainly didn\u2019t realise how wrong it was at the time. It\u2019s taken years and years to understand and come to terms with it. \u201cWhile exact experiences obviously vary ... for too long, the health and wellbeing of young girls has been of secondary importance to a dated, cruel, and \u2013 we\u2019d argue \u2013 often ineffective culture within women\u2019s gymnastics training.\u201d Becky Downie, who has won 14 major medals for Team GB and England during a glittering career, described how she had been \u201ctrained to the point of physical breakdown\u201d on many occasions, before admitting: \u201cOnly in recent years I\u2019ve understood properly the mental impact that\u2019s had upon me.\u201d She added: \u201cAs recently as 2018, and given I was by this point a very senior athlete, I attempted to speak up at a national camp about what I considered was an unsafe approach to my personal training. I was shot down, called \u2018mentally weak\u2019, and told the injury pain levels I was experiencing were in my head. \u201cJust 12 days later, at the European championships, my ankle broke down yet again; a direct consequence of the unsafe training I attempted to bring up less than a fortnight earlier.\u201d Meanwhile her younger sister Ellie said she had constantly been made to feel \u201cashamed\u201d about her weight. \u201cFrom 14 years old I\u2019ve been told to diet consistently,\u201d she said. \u201cAt one time at this age, again after being told I was too heavy, I was told by a nutritionist to provide food diaries of everything that entered my mouth and send daily pictures of me in my underwear to ensure I wasn\u2019t lying. \u201cThere are countless examples of this behaviour I can reference, but I vividly recall being told as a young teenager at a national camp to lose 6kg in two weeks or \u2018there\u2019d be consequences\u2019.\u201d The Downie sisters said they had decided to speak out following the lead of other gymnasts earlier this week including the British Olympians Francesca Fox, who was constantly told she was \u201cfat\u201d and \u201clooked like a hippo\u201d and Lisa Mason, who said she had been repeatedly made to train until her hands ripped and bled and called for the chief executive of GB Gymnastics, Jane Allen, to step down. A third leading gymnast has claimed she was locked in a cupboard by her coach as a 10-year-old. The Downies concluded their statement by saying that the culture in British Gymnastics had improved in recent years after they had spoken out in private, and that since 2018 they were no longer routinely weighed. British Gymnastics, which has launched an independent inquiry into the abuse scandal, was given advance notice of the statement but said it had no comment at this stage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
