Last year Tuesday was dominated by Frankie Dettori, this year it\u2019s Aidan O\u2019Brien who ended with a double in the St James\u2019s Palace and Coventry Stakes. Tomorrow the Prince Of Wales\u2019s promises to be a thriller. Let\u2019s hope for less rain and Sea Of Class getting the go ahead to run. William Haggas is not sure if Sea Of Class will line up for tomorrow\u2019s Prince Of Wales\u2019s Stakes which would be a big blow as that would mean being denied the mouthwatering clash with Magical. The trainer has told Oli Bell on ITV Racing that he will walk the track tomorrow before racing to decide if the filly takes her chance. Ian Williams enjoyed his first success at Royal Ascot when The Grand Visir defied top-weight in the Ascot Stakes and for good measure addled the third, Time To Study. \u201cThe Grand Visir\u2019s hurdling career is still open to interpretation. We ran him back on the turf earlier in the month and he ran very well,\u201d said Williams. \u201cHe was dropped 1lb which allowed him into this race, which was fortunate. We weren\u2019t sure he\u2019d stay the trip, but Richard (Kingscote) gave him a lovely, patient ride into the race. \u201cTurning for home there were only two horses travelling well and that was Time To Study and him. Time To Study probably didn\u2019t stay and he has, all the way to the line. It\u2019s a huge result and great to have a Royal Ascot winner.\u201d PA 1 Addeybb (D Tudhope) 5-1 2 Magic Wand (R L Moore) 9-2 Fav 3 Elarqam (Jim Crowley) 5-1 16 ran And they\u2019re off ...

The progress he\u2019s made in just four starts suggests he has every chance of upholding family honour and he represents the John Gosden/Frankie Dettori team that won this race when it first shed its handicap tag a year ago. Elarqam seemed to appreciate the step up to this distance last time and perhaps this stiffer course will help him some more. Magic Wand hasn\u2019t been able to win since her Ribblesdale success here last June and would have liked a faster surface. Latrobe has been campaigned unconventionally for an Irish Derby winner and surely wants further than this to be seen at his best. 1 The Grand Visir (R Kingscote) 12-1 2 Buildmeupbuttercup (R L Moore) 7-1 3 Time To Study (Jim Crowley) 16-1 4 Fun Mac (P J McDonald) 11-1 19 ran Also: 13-2 Fav Mancini Non Runner: 20 And they\u2019re off ...

The Irish genius has won this three times in four years but his only runner this time, Buildmeupbuttercup, would be a 20-1 shot if trained by anyone else. Instead, she\u2019s favourite with some firms. Mancini makes some appeal, having been a game second after chasing a hot pace at York last time. But preference is for The Grand Visir, whose form with two previous yards gives him every chance here. He showed promise over a shorter trip on his recent reappearance and should be the better for that. Mengli Khan is not far short of top class over jumps but his finishing effort isn\u2019t always the heartiest and it\u2019s a fair question whether he\u2019ll want to go this far in a Flat race. I seem to remember tipping Coeur De Lion for this race last year, when he was a one-paced sixth; listen for the sound of teeth-grinding if he pulls it off this time. His Chester Vase win last time was a career best but heavy ground may have helped and he doesn\u2019t get that this time. 1 Circus Maximus (R L Moore) 10-1 2 King Of Comedy (A Kirby) 4-1 3 Too Darn Hot (L Dettori) 2-1 Fav 11 ran And they\u2019re off ...

O\u2019Brien said: \u201cHe was very green the first day and progressed a lot the next time and won very easily, but he probably didn\u2019t learn a lot because of that. This was the first day he had to learn. He was a little bit slowly away, a little bit lost through the race, but came home really well, so I\u2019m delighted. \u201cYou\u2019d imagine he\u2019d get a mile. He\u2019s probably quicker than he lets on. He\u2019s still a baby and when he won at the Curragh we thought if he was eligible for the Chesham we\u2019d have had no problem running him in it. That type of horse can get quicker when they learn. He was babyish in the race and still came home well. He\u2019d have learnt plenty today.\u201d Richard Hannon said of runner-up Threat: \u201cHe is a good horse. We came here to learn that, and we have. There are no excuses. He is a Group One horse and we can\u2019t wait for the rest of the year. The six furlongs suited him. Maybe (we could go to Newmarket), he is the sort of horse that will come out of the race great. He is strong and mature and hopefully we will have a good year with him.\u201d Archie Watson was thrilled with third-placed Guildsman, saying: \u201cI\u2019m delighted. They have probably gone quick in front and they\u2019ve set the race up for Arizona and us. I thought the second horse\u2019s run on the other side of the track was full of merit. I couldn\u2019t be happier with my lad. There is a very defined path for horses like him as he is a ready-made two-year-old. Six furlongs is his trip and if we are happy with him we will be looking at races like the July Stakes and the Richmond.\u201d The big question for punters on day one at this Royal Ascot is this: how many excuses do you make for a horse who was brilliant last year but has yet to show it this season? Too Darn Hot is the animal in question and he probably still has bundles of talent, despite having been runner-up in both starts this year. But Phoenix Of Spain beat him fair and square in the Irish Guineas and I hope to see Charlie Hills\u2019s grey confirm the form of that three-length success here. Reportedly, he had a troubled preparation for that outing and may well be better for the run. He got within two lengths of Too Darn Hot in September, looking very much like a horse who would do better with time, so there surely was no fluke about his Classic success. The progressive King Of Comedy could be a threat and his trainer, John Gosden, pinched this race with an animal of modest talent last year but this renewal looks stronger. Circus Maximus wasn\u2019t far behind Phoenix Of Spain in October but doesn\u2019t look a specialist miler and the fitting of blinkers suggests his trainer worries he may be short of the necessary speed. Fox Champion, winner of the German Guineas, is progressive and in danger of being underestimated at 20-1, though he\u2019d have to outrun his pedigree to win this. The French raider Shaman has been beaten only by Persian King in his last four starts, so has to be taken seriously. 1 Blue Point (James Doyle) 5-2 2 Battaash (Jim Crowley) 2-1 Fav 3 Soldier\u2019s Call (D Tudhope) 16-1 12 ran And they\u2019re off ... Soldier\u2019s Call was fast away ... Battaash is held up ... Battaash and Blue Point fight it out with the same result as last year when Blue Point beats off his rival. Last year\u2019s runner-up Lord Glitters just prevailed in a blanket finish to the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot. David O\u2019Meara\u2019s grey, who disappointed badly last time out in the Lockinge Stakes, was winning at the highest level for the first time in his career. His fortunes could not have contrasted more with last year\u2019s winner Accidental Agent, who refused to come out of the stalls. The popular Laurens made a bold bid for home and hit the front two furlongs out, but she could never put much daylight between her pursuers. William Haggas\u2019 One Master came swooping through, showing the pace that won her the Prix de la Foret last season, and certainly hit the front, before her run she faltered inside the final 100 yards. That left Beat The Bank, another who ran poorly in the Lockinge, and Lord Glitters (14-1) to fight it out, with Danny Tudhope managing to get his grey head in front by a neck. O\u2019Meara said: \u201cHe always runs well here, he loves the track. \u201cIn the Lockinge he had no cover and over-raced a touch, but I thought today Danny gave him a perfect ride from the word go. Watching the race it was one of the easiest Royal Ascot runners we\u2019ve ever had to watch because there was never a moment I thought he was in trouble. He had a programme last year and he\u2019ll follow something similar this season, I would have thought.\u201d PA The train strike is not having much of an impact according to this report in the Racing Post.

Taking the odds from all the bookmakers on the site, the average percentage difference between the best and worst odds of every winning horse (taken at 11am each day) at Royal Ascot in 2018 was 28%. The first and second from last year\u2019s race, Blue Point and Battaash, seem the two to focus on once again. It\u2019s interesting that the market appears dazzled by the brilliance Battaash showed at Haydock last month and he appears the more talented of the pair, at his very best. But a strike-rate of two from five last year shows he often underperforms and he did not seem to enjoy the big-day atmosphere here last year. Blue Point is taken to come out on top once more. Encouragingly, the Charlie Appleby yard had a double in Group races on Sunday, having gone a couple of months without success at that level. Sergei Prokofiev, third to Calyx in the Coventry on this day last year, has fallen well short at Group One level so far and was a disappointing favourite behind Mabs Cross in the Palace House last month. Mabs Cross was in turn well held by Battaash at Haydock but she was a close third in this race a year ago and had her big day in the Prix de l\u2019Abbaye when Battaash flopped in fourth. Providing international flavour are runners from the US (Imprimis), Australia (Houtzen) and New Zealand (Enzo\u2019s Lad). All three seem short of top-class so far, though Imprimis is certainly heading in that direction. Eve Johnson-Houghton is putting on a brave face after Accidental Agent refused to race in the Queen Anne Stakes. 1 Arizona (R L Moore) 15-8 Fav 2 Threat (Tom Marquand) 4-1 3 Guildsman (Oisin Murphy) 6-1 17 ran And they\u2019re off ...

That being said, the time of that first race suggests the going description of \u2018good\u2019 ground is accurate. The Hannon yard has been out of luck in this since the back-to-back victories of Canford Cliffs and Strong Suit (2009, 2010) but they know a Royal Ascot juvenile when they get one. This race was immediately named as the target when Threat was an impressive winner on Guineas weekend, showing professionalism to beat an odds-on favourite and proving hard to pull up. There should be plenty more to come from this chestnut, whose grand-dam is Shiva, a Group One winner for Sir Henry Cecil. Arizona won well on his second start but it\u2019s open to question what he achieved, having started at odds of 8-15 that day. The runner-up, a stablemate of his called King Of Athens, was pretty green on his first start that day but is really well bred and could take quite a step forward here, so there are worse each-way options at 40-1. Guildsman, from a stable that excels with two-year-olds, won handily on his debut at Goodwood but may have relished the soft ground that day and meets a drier surface this time. 1 Lord Glitters (D Tudhope) 14-1 2 Beat The Bank (S De Sousa) 20-1 3 One Master (P C Boudot) 20-1 16 ran And they\u2019re off ...

Lord Glitters came late to snatch the victory. Any French visitors at Ascot today may be amused to note, as they scan through their Racing Posts, that a horse called Je M\u2019En Fous is to run at Brighton tonight. Her name translates roughly as \u2018I Don\u2019t Give A Stuff\u2019. I seem to remember being told at school, eons ago, that this was an extremely rude phrase that should not be used in polite company, but the BHA\u2019s naming team are satisfied that nothing inappropriate has occurred.

The Hong Kong Jockey Club is producing extensive form guides for every day of the meeting which can be viewed or downloaded for free here. It\u2019s somewhat surprising to see that Sir Michael Stoute has won this race just three times, the most recent of which was 17 years ago, especially as he has a record eight wins in the Lockinge, the most obvious trial for this. That thought is something of a brake on enthusiasm for his most recent Lockinge winner, Mustashry, but it is hard to forget the powerful finish that one produced at Newbury last month and this steady improver is fairly priced at around 5-1; he\u2019s Stoute\u2019s only runner on Day One. Barney Roy is an unknown quantity, having had two runs at a much lower level since his comeback from a year off. He will be remembered as the St James\u2019s Palace winner of 2017, earning himself a chance at stud and doubtless he would rather still be there. Alas for fertility issues. Even his best form leaves him a smidgen to find. Le Brivido is finally drifting to a reasonable price, having been a slightly perverse choice of favourite for this race until Monday. He finished strongly in the Lockinge but still has more to prove and hasn\u2019t won for two years, though he was impressive in this week two years ago when powering home in the Jersey. The very likeable Laurens has won five Group Ones confined to fillies and mares and was a fine second to Mustashry in the Lockinge. He had the advantage of a previous run that day and she\u2019ll be a big danger if sharper this time. 1st Blue evens fav The Times racing corr knows who the must-read writers are ;) Important news for the Queen Mary Stakes tomorrow.

More from the soaraway Sun here ... It\u2019s almost that time ... for the details of who will be in the royal procession down the centre of the track. I attended a Serpentine gallery exhibition by artist Mark Wallinger back in 1994 when one of his installations, called \u2018Royal Ascot\u2019, consisted of a series of video monitors on top of wheeled flight cases, each isolating the royal carriage\u2019s leisurely progress down the track on the Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday (respectively, as it was then) of the meeting with the added TV commentary. The British Council described the work thus: \u2018Simultaneous footage exposes precise choreography: the Queen\u2019s frozen smile and rigid curls, the tilt of her head, her gloved wave, the Duke of Edinburgh raising his top hat, the national anthem striking up. Appropriately for an event whose media coverage focuses on the parade of hats and dresses rather than the sport, here we have a close-up on clothes, on the Queen\u2019s dolly mixture of pinks, tangerines, limes; the difference from day to day is barely discernible, just as the four BBC commentaries merge in a confused blather. This repetition of imagery, all backed by bright green turf, brings into play Andy Warhol\u2019s late screenprints of Elizabeth II from his \u2018Reigning Queens\u2019 series (1985), a quartet of the postage stamp icon in camp conjugations of Hollywood make-up and bubblegum colours.\u2019 The Duke of Edinburgh, who has retired from royal duties and apparently hated his trips down the road from Windsor Castle to the races, is missing but little else has changed including the blather. This is last year\u2019s opening day procession, presented by Mike Vince. See if you can spot the difference this year ... It\u2019s raining ... and our snapper Tom Jenkins has captured the action ... The most obvious betting move this morning is that Too Darn Hot, beaten on both of his starts so far this year including in the Irish 2,000 Guineas last time, has replaced Phoenix Of Spain, who beat him by three lengths at The Curragh, as the favourite for the St James\u2019s Palace Stakes, Tuesday\u2019s feature event. Too Darn Hot was the top-rated juvenile last year, earning the same rating as the great Frankel at the end of his two-year-old campaign. Unlike Frankel, however, he has not progressed at all so far this year. John Gosden, his trainer, has blamed himself for choosing the wrong path through the early months of the campaign after Too Darn Hot suffered an injury which kept him out of the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket, and also feels that his colt is as well as he has had him all year ahead of this race. But even so, the money that has forced him down to 9-4 clear favourite at the top prices in the market, with Phoenix Of Spain out to 5-2, seems to bear little relation to this season\u2019s form. Mustashry briefly displaced Le Brivido as favourite for the opening Queen Anne Stakes this morning but they are now joint-favourites at 11-2, while last year\u2019s 33-1 winner, Accidental Agent, is on the drift and out to 14-1 from 12-1 overnight. There is currently a clear favourite in the Coventry Stakes too, with money arriving for Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s Arizona (11-4 from 3-1 overnight) and Threat, who was also 3-1 overnight, now out to 100-30 and even 7-2 in a place. Bookmakers at the track are fighting shy of the blue wave too as everyone wants to be on that colour for the Queen\u2019s Hat Stakes at 2pm ... Bit early with this today as there is already news of a \u2018plunge\u2019. Apparently blue is the colour and there is word of the bookies suspending betting after that colour was backed to be the Queen\u2019s choice this afternoon. I spoke to royal reporter Robert Jobson who told me: \u201cOnly Angela Kelly, her designer, the Royals and their guests know the colour of her hat.\u201d A Bookmakers.TV spokesperson said: \u201cThe market on the colour of Her Majesty\u2019s titfer is a unique one in that without the guide of the exchanges odds compilers have to roll back the years and bet to their opinion which gives rise to differing favourites in a quickly moving market. \u201cFor long running fans of the royal meeting the speculation is an essential part of the day but newer audiences, less likely to be consuming the spectacle as a whole off course, are seemingly less interested. Still, the popularity of the market - which serves primarily as a PR excercise - in sections of the media is showing no sign of waning which is music to the ears of Royal Ascot purists. \u201cAs for day one, the vibes are Her Majesty will opt for a blue number and if that materialises the market vibes will have been spot on. The other two colours we are likely to see this week are green and white, which Her Majesty has worn 11 times since 2005.\u201d bettingexpert have given us a form guide (below) for all the hat colours worn by the Queen since 2005. Pink and blue have made up 57% of her choices on the Tuesday in that time, while pink has also featured most on the Wednesday and Thursday of the five-day meeting. Green, which the Queen has worn 11 times since 2005, and white, also 11, are her next most-fancied hat colours and look likely to get a showing this week. Last night William Hill were betting: 3-1 Blue, Pink, 4-1 Green, 6-1 Yellow, 7-1 Purple, 8-1 White, 14-1 Orange, 25-1 Black, Brown and Red. If I get some updated betting I\u2019ll post it here. Sir Michael Stoute 79 Aidan O\u2019Brien 65 John Gosden 47 Mark Johnston 43 Saeed bin Suroor 36 Paul Cole 21 Mick Channon 18 Dermot Weld 17 David Elsworth 16 Roger Charlton 10 James Fanshawe 10 Wesley Ward 10 Aidan O\u2019Brien seeks to be top trainer here for the 10th time, having come out on top for the last four years, during which time he and Ryan Moore have come to dominate the thoughts of Ascot punters. Sir Michael Stoute\u2019s four winners last year finally secured him the all-time record among trainers, carrying him clear of the mark of 75 set by Sir Henry Cecil. He has been top trainer here six times, most recently in 2014, while John Gosden has done it just once, in 2012. Mustashry, fancied for the Queen Anne, is Stoute\u2019s only runner on Day One. Gosden is busier with four, including two of the top three in the betting for the St James\u2019s Palace Stakes. But all Flat trainers are jealous of Aidan O\u2019Brien, who gets to saddle 11 runners today, though only Arizona is likely to start favourite. Big claim this ... Frankie Dettori 60 Ryan Moore 53 Jamie Spencer 26 William Buick 23 Olivier Peslier 16 James Doyle 10 The last person other than Ryan Moore to be top jockey at Royal Ascot was ... ? Yes, Johnny Murtagh in 2013, you knew that. Moore has come out on top here for the last five years and eight times in all, a Piggott-esque period of dominance. He\u2019s 8-11 for a repeat. Dettori, a 3-1 shot this time, has been top jockey here five times but not since 2004. His four winners last year was a spirited effort for a man in his late 40s who likes to take it easy. Actually, that\u2019s unfair on the strength of today\u2019s card, since the Italian has got himself a ride in every race, as (more predictably) has Moore. Here\u2019s how the big two match up for rides today. Moore has the better strength in depth but Dettori has the best chance in Too Darn Hot. He\u2019d be especially sick to see Moore going past on Circus Maximus, as Dettori rode that one in the Derby a fortnight ago. 2.30 Dettori: Hazapour 9-1 Moore: Le Brivido 6-1 3.05 Dettori: Light Angel 20-1 Moore: Arizona 3-1 3.40 Dettori: Imprimis 12-1 Moore: Sergei Prokofiev 10-1 4.20 Dettori: Too Darn Hot 9-4 Moore: Circus Maximus 14-1 5.00 Dettori: Batts Rock 12-1 Moore: Buildmeupbuttercup 13-2 5.35 Dettori: Star Of Bengal 10-1 Moore: Magic Wand 5-1 If you fancy someone else to ride most winners this week, the best odds available are: 5-1 James Doyle, 20-1 Jim Crowley, 33-1 Silvestre De Sousa, 40-1 Oisin Murphy and Donnacha O\u2019Brien, 66-1 or bigger the rest. You want to know what\u2019s going to win, right? Here are our tipster Chris Cook\u2019s selections for the first day. Stay here and we\u2019ll have an in-depth preview from Chris for every race as the afternoon goes on. 2.30 Queen Anne Stakes Mustashry 11-2 3.05 Coventry Stakes Threat 11-4 3.40 King\u2019s Stand Stakes Blue Point 3-1 4.20 St James\u2019s Palace Stakes Phoenix Of Spain (nap) 2-1 5.00 Ascot Stakes (Handicap) The Grand Visir (nb) 18-1 5.35 Wolferton Stakes Star Of Bengal 10-1 The overnight weather and going report from Ascot is that it was dry overnight, as it has been since Sunday morning, though there is still a forecast of possible thundery showers from late morning until tomorrow. The GoingStick readings are interesting: stands side 8.9, centre 8.9, far side 8.7 and the round course 7.4. That suggests the round course is a fair bit slower than the straight, but also that the straight is borderline good-to-firm. The only non-runner so far today, incidentally, is The Cashel Man in the Ascot Handicap at 5.00. He\u2019s lame. Hello and welcome to five days of frippery, fantastic racing and financial ruin or riches depending on how your wagers work out on the track. Of course most of the action at Ascot, as always, takes place off the track and our first bit of exclusive news is that ITV Racing\u2019s ebullient and most-watchable (for some) presenter, Matt Chapman, is a non-runner. I spoke to Matt and the reason is ... he\u2019s speechless (for once). He told me why he will be missing (via tic-tac): \u201c[It\u2019s] great news for many TV viewers as for some reason between Windsor on Monday [on his other gig at Sky Sports Racing] and Ascot today my voice has packed in. Absolutely gutted ... but know #TeamITV will smash an amazing Day1\u201d You could win a \u00a350 account credit by proving your tipping prowess on today\u2019s races.

As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional level stakes of \u00a31 at starting price. Non-runners count as losers. Please post all your tips in a single posting, using the comment facility below, before the first race at 2.30pm. There are six races at Ascot today and you must post a single selection for each race. Our usual terms and conditions \u2013 which you can read here \u2013 will apply, except that this will be a strictly one-day thing. If we get a tie after all the races have been run, the winner will be the one who posted their tips earliest out of those with the highest score. If you don\u2019t win today, don\u2019t despair. We are running an identical competition on each day of the Royal meeting, up to Friday. And post your tips or racing-related comments below the line. My first big gamble of Royal Ascot week was taking the train to the course despite all the warnings of chaos thanks to a strike on South West Trains, co-incidentally called for the busiest week of the year on the Waterloo-Reading line. The result? Well, it might be a little different on the way home this evening but thus far, it\u2019s a winner, on the 09.28 from Clapham Junction at any rate. Betting-wise, I should probably quite now while I\u2019m ahead. But it won\u2019t be easy with the best five days of the Flat season now just a few hours\u2019 distant. The Tuesday card at Ascot is the one that is often referred to as the purist\u2019s afternoon at the Royal meeting, which is another way of saying that it is top-loaded with three of the meeting\u2019s eight Group One races and also tends to attract the smallest crowd of the five days. The scheduling remains a bit of a puzzle, as it means that almost half of the week\u2019s biggest events have been run by 4.15pm on the first afternoon, and in terms of boosting the live audience for the showpiece races, it might make sense to shift one of the Group Ones towards the end of the week. Change is glacial at Royal Ascot, though, and the counter-argument is that Thursday to Saturday will sell out in any case. The status quo keeps the purists happy too. My colleague Chris Cook\u2019s tips for the opening day are here, while punters might like to know that pool betting with the Tote promises to offer a little more value this year as an alternative to the bookmakers. This year\u2019s meeting marks the debut of World Pool, a co-mingling exercise between the Tote\u2019s UK operation and the hugely popular pari-mutuel system in Hong Kong. Tote bets placed in either jurisdiction will go into the same pot, which should ensure much stronger pools and therefore more certainty for punters that they will be getting fair odds for their money when the dividend is declared. Nothing, after all, puts a punter off the Tote more thoroughly than a 33-1 winner that pays \u00a316.60 on the machine. There are a few minor caveats. The Hong Kong tote cannot support races with more than 25 runners, so the Royal Hunt Cup and Saturday\u2019s Wokingham, probably the two biggest betting races of the week, will have only a local pool. It might also not be the best way to back one of this week\u2019s runners from Asia - Lim\u2019s Cruiser goes in the Diamond Jubilee on Saturday and Deirdre, from Japan, runs in tomorrow\u2019s Prince Of Wales\u2019s Stakes. But for a sport looking for ways to boost its income from betting, World Pool does offer a small sliver of hope. The Queen will be arriving at around 2pm BST and the first race, as ever, is due off at 2.30pm. As yet, there is little sign of the thunderstorms that were threatened in the overnight forecast \u2013 though of course, it\u2019s in their nature to pop up from nowhere \u2013 and ground is officially good and good-to-soft in places on the round course."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
