Enemies of Gerald Ford used to wisecrack that this un-intellectual president, a former football player, had taken too many tackles with his helmet off. Maybe Concussion will render that anecdote obsolete. Will Smith gives a borderline insufferable performance \u2013 the wrong side of the borderline \u2013 in a solemn and unsatisfying sports drama, in which his sonorous smiley saintliness is very much to the fore. It is based on the true story of Dr Bennet Omalu, a Nigerian pathologist in Pittsburgh who single-handedly challenged the powerful, corporate world of American football. He had evidence that, helmets or no helmets, the game is giving its players brain damage. Now, non-NFL believers in British cinemas might conclude: no shit, Mycroft. It certainly seems likely that it took a non-American outsider to challenge this US holy cow. But the movie passes over that obvious point, emphasising instead how passionately Omalu loves America, and the movie also has to say how great football is. So what did this struggle finally achieve? Stronger helmets? Tougher rules on contact? Uh, not exactly. We\u2019re left with the supposedly inspiring personal journey of Omalu himself, and Smith\u2019s performance is shallow, conceited and bland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
