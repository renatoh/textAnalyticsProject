Donald Lynden-Bell, Roger Griffin, Neville \u201cNick\u201d Woolf and Wallace Sargent are four eminently likable and distinguished academics who appear like gentleman explorers as they tackle a hike in the burning sun that might dismay people much younger. Their final goal is the remarkable Rainbow Bridge in Utah; on the way, they chat to each other and Rose about astronomy, the unimaginably vast reaches of the universe, about life on other planets and on our own. Oddly, the film reminded me of Patricio Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s Nostalgia for the Light (2010), about astronomers in 1970s Chile, who found in this discipline an escape from tyranny. Star Men isn\u2019t political like this, but it finds an extraterrestrial strangeness or majesty in the American wilderness, just as Guzm\u00e1n found it in Chile\u2019s Atacama desert."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
