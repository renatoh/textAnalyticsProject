Of women struggling to articulate what they have left unsaid sometimes for decades, and what has gone unsaid by our sex \u2013 en masse \u2013 throughout history, until now. You probably know the basic story \u2013 by osmosis if nothing else \u2013 so heavily was the media mogul\u2019s eventual fall covered when the weight of evidence finally became too much for a man of even his resources to withstand. MacFarlane tells the story well. She gives due recognition to the journalists, especially Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor, who broke the story in the New York Times, and Ronan Farrow\u2019s gathering of 13 witness accounts in the New Yorker after painstaking investigations. But, like Dream Hampton\u2019s Surviving R Kelly, Untouchable prioritises the victims\u2019 stories (regardless of their personal celebrity or lack thereof \u2013 here \u201cnames\u201d such as Rosanna Arquette simply slip in next to those without public profiles) and fills in the perpetrator\u2019s to explain his relative power or position at the time. As with the R Kelly film \u2013 thought to have been instrumental in the R\u2019n\u2019B star\u2019s latest arrest on federal sex trafficking charges \u2013 a pattern of predatory behaviour emerges, painted stroke by painful stroke by those who found themselves first charmed and cajoled by one version of Weinstein, then confronted with a very different one behind closed doors. Whether we should be profoundly glad, deeply sad or simply exhausted to be living in a time where \u201cexamination of the lives of serial sexual predators unmasked after years of hiding in plain sight\u201d is on the verge of becoming a recognised TV genre, let alone one taking up the slack left by uninterested police and legislative forces, I leave to you to decide. But we are where we are. Which is, waiting to see who gets their Jeffrey Epstein production off the blocks first. Beyond a specific modus operandi \u2013 Weinstein\u2019s involved hotel suites, towelling robes, forcible massages, volcanic rage and threats such as: \u201cDo you really want to make an enemy of me for five minutes of your time?\u201d \u2013 as an insight into one man\u2019s apparent prelude to rape or assault (Weinstein denies all claims), such documentaries render a more valuable service in demonstrating, relentlessly and unavoidably, two things. The first is how perfectly our world is built for predators to function. Of Weinstein\u2019s staff who admit they knew something \u2013 something \u2013 was happening, a common refrain is that they assumed \u201csome sort of agreement\u201d had been reached between the would-be actors and the mogul. If you live in a society that already believes in the casting couch, because the concept of young women as more-or-less sexual resources to be exploited is so embedded in the psyche, half your work \u2013 to normalise your predilections, to secure complicity \u2013 is done. With the likes of the gossip columnist AJ Benza out there \u2013 \u201cYou put a light on the porch,\u201d he says of Weinstein\u2019s power, \u201cyou\u2019re gonna get a lot of moths\u201d \u2013 the world is yours to do with as you will. The second, perhaps even more valuable, service it renders is to show the uniformity of the women\u2019s responses to suddenly finding themselves in terrifying situations, and how far they deviate from \u201ccommon sense\u201d or \u201cnatural\u201d expectations (words defined almost entirely by men, who have least need of them). They don\u2019t fight. They compute their chances against a much taller, heavier opponent (\u201cHe\u2019s huge, you know,\u201d says Hope d\u2019Amore, who worked for him in the early days and says she was assaulted in 1978) and they go still. \u201cThe freeze thing kicks in,\u201d says the actor Caitlin Delaney. \u201cYou just want it to be over.\u201d They maximise their chances of survival (\u201cI felt leaving would be worse,\u201d says actor Erika Rosenbaum, when she saw a smashed and bloody toilet seat in his bathroom) and try and leave in other ways instead. Actor Paz de la Huerta remembers \u201chovering over my body\u201d as, she says, Weinstein raped her. \u201cI definitely went somewhere else,\u201d says Delaney. Rosenbaum remembers hoping that if she kept still enough she would somehow disappear. Almost every woman watching will understand. Some men will, too. If these films add to their number, maybe we can begin to change the world."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
