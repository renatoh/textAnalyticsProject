It is available on prescription in 2mg and 5mg strengths, although you can buy it over the counter in many other countries. Take melatonin the first evening you arrive at your destination to regulate your body clock and promote sleep. Continue to take it for half as many days as time zones you cross, plus one (eg if you cross six time zones take it for four days). Do the same on your return. Your body clock can only adjust by two hours a night, so expect to feel jet lagged for four days if you cross eight time zones. Light exposure Get as much exposure to sunlight as possible in the afternoon (this is important). Wear dark glasses in the morning when you are meant to be avoiding light. Diet A high-protein diet promotes wakefulness and a high-carb diet promotes sleep. So make it Atkins for breakfast and lunch, and pasta for supper. Vitamin supplements Take a vitamin B complex and 1,000mg of vitamin C daily a week before travelling and continue for at least a week after returning. Water Drink at least 1.5 litres on a long-haul flight and spritz yourself with an Evian spray to avoid dehydration. Exercise Increase your exercise regime several days before flying, and walk a lot during the journey (doing laps of the plane is recommended) and when you arrive. Aromatherapy Dab on lavender oil during the flight, geranium on arrival and inhale rosemary oil to combat fatigue and prevent you falling asleep. Acupuncture Have a course of acupuncture for a fortnight before departure and on your return. Homeopathy Take a 6C dose of cocculus a few minutes before boarding the plane, then twice daily for half as many days as time zones covered. Brown paper bags on your feet on the plane The jury's still out on this old wives' tale. Self-delusion On boarding the plane, set your watch to the time in your destination and tell yourself that you don't get jetlag."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
