From this point on until Sunday, the quality of the tennis will be taken for granted as the candidates are whittled down to the final pair, he says, and the difference will be manifest, as ever, in the mental struggle. Lendl, no mean fighter on court himself, was pleased to see that quality emerge in Murray\u2019s ugly battle to subdue the danger of Fabio Fognini over four sets in the gloom of Centre Court on Friday night, and he suspects there will be more of those moments to come. \u201cIt\u2019s Andy. I mean, you expect it, don\u2019t you?\u201d he said on Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s how people win tournaments \u2013 they fight. It doesn\u2019t come easy. You don\u2019t always play your best and you have to get through that; fighting is part of it. Sometimes you feel tired and you have to push through that pain barrier as well. That comes with it. \u201cUnpredictability with skill is very dangerous. Fognini, I thought, played a very good match, with the exception of the third set, and, when you have an unpredictable player with skill, like him or Henri Leconte, they are very dangerous when they step on the court because it is not necessarily in your hands what is going to happen. You have to expect the unexpected and, when that guy is on, it\u2019s difficult.\u201d He was giving nothing away, of course, about how Murray might handle Paire, who is 46 places below the world No1 but who took a set off him in their only Tour\u2011level encounter, on the clay of Monte Carlo last year. It would not only be a shock if Murray lost against him on the grass where he has won two titles but would be at odds with precedent: the lowest-ranked player he has lost to at Wimbledon was David Nalbandian, who was No19 in the world when he beat the Scottish teenager in the third round on his debut 12 years ago. Having come to terms with the expectations of a nation after breaking that 77-year Wimbledon drought in 2013, Murray has enjoyed himself more at his home tournament. If he beats Paire, he will be in the quarter-finals for the 10th year in a row; only Roger Federer and Jimmy Connors (14) and Boris Becker (11) in the Open era have gone this deep at Wimbledon more often. Novak Djokovic, who looked good again in handling the quirky challenge of Ernests Gulbis in the third round on Saturday, is reaching for his ninth quarter-final when he plays Adrian Mannarino. If Murray defeats Paire, he plays either Sam Querrey, whom he leads 7-1 over their careers, or Kevin Anderson (6-2). On grass, only Federer is Murray\u2019s statistical master with 160 match wins to his 106; Paire has won 18 matches on grass. Whatever the power of numbers, Murray and Lendl respect the threat Paire poses and will prepare accordingly. \u201c[The type of preparation] depends on what\u2019s needed. When you have an opponent who comes in [as Paire does], we do more returning and passing shots; when it\u2019s an opponent who stays back, we do more rhythm, go more towards the opponent.\u201d He is satisfied with the level of Murray\u2019s tennis against three unconventional opponents in the first week. \u201cAndy is hitting it better and cleaner every practice now and getting his timing back and rhythm back,\u201d Lendl said. \u201cRhythm was very difficult with [Alexander] Bublik and [Dustin] Brown. \u201cHe\u2019s in the second week so he is in with a chance \u2013 same as 15 other guys. All those guys, they are great players, anybody can win. \u201cBy the end of [Monday], if there is no bad weather, there will be only seven left \u2013 and hopefully Andy. The top guys are top guys because they do things a little bit better than the other guys. Can they be beaten? Of course they can but, in the end, most of the time the top guys do win because they are a little better than the others. Whether it\u2019s problem solving, whether it\u2019s lack of matches for a while, dealing with distractions off the court \u2013 these guys are used to it. That\u2019s part of the business. \u201cThe top guys are better purely in stroke production, movement, physically. You put all that into a package and the package is slightly better than the guys below. Yes, they can get upset, or the others can upset them, but, if they play 100 times, they are going to win more than half and that\u2019s because the package is a little more complete.\u201d The other imponderables on Monday will be the weather \u2013 there is a 64% chance of rain in mid-afternoon, about the time Murray and Paire are scheduled to go on court \u2013 and the diminishing quality of the grass. Lendl appears less worried than most about either. \u201cThe weather obviously has a lot to do with how the courts play. It reminds me a little bit of \u201987 when we had no rain and the courts played extremely fast. That\u2019s not a question for me really; I am not the agronomist. I think those guys can answer those questions much better on how the grass reacts when it has no rain. And, even if they can water it, is it the same, isn\u2019t it the same? I don\u2019t really know. It\u2019s something I can\u2019t influence so you just worry about what you have to do with the conditions you have.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
