The site very quickly imploded under the sheer deluge of hits, but not before US gamers managed to mirror the images across the web. Destructoid has them all as does MyGen. It looks like Evo-X has now removed the shots; a Google translation of the site (sorry German was never my strongpoint) hints at pressure - or at least expected pressure - from Bungie. Hmm, the words, stable door, horse and bolted spring to mind. They're pretty boring anyway."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
