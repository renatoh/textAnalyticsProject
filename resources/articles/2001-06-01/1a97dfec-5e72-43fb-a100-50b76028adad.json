The high street bank has 270,000 policies and admits half are termed \"red\" - requiring homeowners to make up the difference between the value of the endowment and the amount they borrowed. Unless they act now, policyholders will face costs of tens of thousands of pounds. In the wake of growing concern over whether endowments will deliver the returns promised, around 6m households holding more than 10m policies have received letters in the past year telling them how their policy is performing. Just one in 25 of Lloyds policyholders has received a letter saying their endowment is on track to pay off the mortgage. By comparison, 49% of policies provided by Scottish Amicable are definitely on course. The figures suggest Lloyds TSB may have the worst problem with endowments of any of the dozens of financial institutions caught up in the deba cle. Across the industry, some 1.4m policies are in the \"red\". Lloyds TSB's admission that 50% of its endowments are in the red compares with an industry average of 13.5%. Disclosure of the figures will reopen debate about whether policyholders should be compensated en masse for the alleged failings of endowment providers. It may also prompt demands for Lloyds TSB to reassure customers by putting in place a \"mortgage promise\" similar to those offered by companies such as Standard Life, which has pledged to make up shortfalls under certain conditions. Around two years ago warnings were sounded that low inflation and low interest rates meant the returns people will get in future may not provide enough money to pay off loans. Recent stock market volatility has compounded the gloomy picture and means people may have to dig into their own pockets to make up the shortfall when their policy matures unless they take action now. As the crisis deepened amid claims that many people were missold policies, the Financial Services Authority, the City watchdog, ordered all insurance companies to contact their customers by June 30 to inform them of the status of their policies. Of the 10.7m endowment policies, the Association of British Insurers, the industry's trade body, said that \"re-projection letters\" have now gone out to holders of more than 97% of them. These letters are coded red, amber or green according to the severity of the shortfall risk, with red indicating that the policy is no longer on track to pay off the home loan and will fall short unless the policy delivers an annual investment return of \"8% plus\" - considered extremely unlikely. Amber policies need between 6 and 8% growth, while green is generally considered to indicate the policy is in the clear. Lloyds TSB said that 135,000 (50%) of its policies are in the red danger zone, while another 124,200 (46%) fall into the amber category. Some 10,800 of its policies, or 4%, are classed as green. A spokeswoman blamed \"changes in the economic environment\". She said most of its policies are relatively new and have not had the opportunity to benefit from long-term exposure to the stock market."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
