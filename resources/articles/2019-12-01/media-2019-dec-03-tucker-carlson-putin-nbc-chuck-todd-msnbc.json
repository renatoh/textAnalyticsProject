On Monday night, a week after making waves by saying he was \u201crooting\u201d for Russia in its conflict with Ukraine \u2013 and then claiming to have been joking \u2013 the host blasted critics of the Trump administration employed by cable news. \u201cPutin,\u201d he said, \u201cfor all his faults, does not hate America as much as many of these people do.\u201d Bemoaning with Spiro Agnew-esque verve the \u201csneering accusations of our mindless public intellectuals and hair hats in the television anchor\u2019s seat\u201d, the public intellectual and TV anchor began by taking aim at NBC Meet the Press host Chuck Todd, for his questioning of Louisiana Republican senator John Kennedy on Sunday. Todd and Kennedy engaged in a fiery exchange over the senator\u2019s insistence that the theory Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, rather than Russia, merits further investigation. Todd responded: \u201cYou realize the only other person selling this argument outside the United States is this man, Vladimir Putin!\u201d The US intelligence community agrees it was Moscow not Kyiv which interfered in 2016, in the aim of helping Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton. Nonetheless, as Trump faces impeachment for his conduct regarding Ukraine, his supporters in Congress are pushing the Ukraine conspiracy theory. Carlson called Todd a \u201cmouth-breather\u201d who \u201cwent full Joe McCarthy\u201d on Kennedy and claimed special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigated Russian interference in 2016, links between Trump and Moscow and possible obstruction of justice by the president, found nothing amiss. \u201cIt\u2019s not really a story,\u201d he insisted, \u201cit never happened, there was no collusion, Russia didn\u2019t hack our democracy. The whole thing was a ludicrous talking point invented by the Hillary Clinton campaign on or about 9 November 2016\u201d, the day after the election. Mueller did not prove criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Moscow. He also emphasised that \u201ccollusion\u201d is not a term in US criminal law. But he did chart extensive contacts between the Trump campaign and Moscow and associates of the president including campaign chair Paul Manafort, national security adviser Michael Flynn, lawyer Michael Cohen and close aide Roger Stone have been convicted on charges arising from the inquiry. The special counsel also indicted 26 Russian nationals and three Russian companies and detailed extensive attempts by the president to obstruct the course of justice. Carlson continued, playing a montage of MSNBC pundits and hosts bemoaning attitudes to Russia within the Trump administration and the Republican party. \u201cIf you excluded debunked conspiracy theories,\u201d Carlson said, \u201ccould any of these people actually tell you why Vladimir Putin is so bad? Why is he so bad? \u2018He\u2019s bad!\u2019 Chuck Todd says. OK, speak slowly so I can understand.\u201d Carlson continued: \u201cFor Chuck Todd and the rest of the dummies, Vladimir Putin isn\u2019t a real person with actual ideas and priorities and a country and beliefs. No, he stopped being that long ago. He\u2019s a metaphor, a living metaphor, he\u2019s the boogeyman! Step out of line and you\u2019re a traitor in league with Vladimir Putin! \u201cThe irony, of course, is that Putin, for all his faults, does not hate America as much as many of these people do. They really dislike our country. And they call other people traitors because they\u2019re \u2018mouthing the talking points of Putin\u2019! These are people who don\u2019t know anything about Russia, who don\u2019t speak Russian!\u201d In conclusion, Carlson said the US \u201cought to be in a relationship with Russia aligned against China, to the extent that we can\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
