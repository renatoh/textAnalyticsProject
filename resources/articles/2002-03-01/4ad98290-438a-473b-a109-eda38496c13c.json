It scooped a \u00a3500,000 advance - the highest figure ever paid to an unknown children's writer - after a fierce bidding war won by Puffin, and the film rights were then optioned for $350,000 by Miramax, who are now working on the film. Colfer heard the news of the film deal while on playground duty. \"I can't overstate the shock. The rest of yard duty was a blur. I vaguely remember wiping noses and tying shoelaces, but to be honest, kids could have been escaping en masse over the fence and I wouldn't have noticed.\" It catapulted him into a new way of life. Artemis Fowl was lavishly published and promoted and Colfer, who then was teaching children with learning difficulties in a primary school in Wexford, began a year of author tours - including the US, where the success of J K Rowling and Philip Pullman had paved the way for the latest UK hot hit in children's fantasy. Colfer's story, which he described as \"Die Hard with fairies\" - an irresistible tag phrase that was universally picked up on - was a bestseller within weeks of publication, capturing boys in particular with its dissolute 12-year-old criminal mastermind who wants to capture a fairy to ransom, and its mix of new technologies with primitive characters such as the earth-eating dwarf, Mulch Diggums. There is something of the fairy world about Colfer himself. He is disarmingly charming but with a gleam of mayhem in his eye. He speaks fast, almost too fast to catch all the words. He is a natural story-teller, reeling off rambling tales that are a rich mixture of family anecdotes - being one of five brothers provides him with an endless source of copy - and fantasy. Audiences love him. As so often, the marketing stories that propelled Colfer were not always accurate. In the first place, he is not the quite the \"newcomer\" he was popularly billed as being. When his first book, Benny and Omar, was published in Dublin in 1999, it quickly became a bestseller within the Irish market. The follow up title, about the same smart-alec Irish boy, was shortlisted for Ireland's top prize, the Bisto Children's Award 2000. Snatching time at the end of the teaching day and after his son went to bed, Colfer wrote three more books before Artemis Fowl. Did Colfer have any idea that it would be this book that would shoot him into the UK charts? \"I remember thinking that Artemis might get published in the UK, but I had no idea how big it was going to be. How could anyone foresee something like that?\" Indeed, they couldn't, but Colfer did have an inkling that this was a bigger book and, urged on by his four brothers who thought that his writing should be more widely known, he sent it to an agent in London, picking her name out of The Writers' and Artists' Yearbook. While Colfer wanted to write an Irish story, he was canny enough to realise that to appeal to a UK-wide audience, he had to create a fantasy with a difference. \"In Ireland, every second book on the shelf is a retelling of the magical legends of Ireland. I love the genre, but I didn't think that publishers would be interested in yet another fairy story. So I got rid of the traditional timeless fairy and went for a gritty urban underworld civilisation instead.\" Despite the new take, it remains very Irish. With its cast of leprechauns and fairies - including some nasty characters whom Colfer describes as \"streetwise, neurotic, psychotic and sarcastic creatures\" - it moves easily between the heroics of James Bond and the cunning of Finn McCool. Artemis himself has many of those anti-heroic characteristics. \"Artemis is on a journey: he is neither a hero nor an anti-hero. He is discovering his values as he goes along,\" says Colfer. Unusually for a children's book, the book has no overt moral message either, although Colfer insists that it does have messages. \"It's just that the reader has to make up his or her own mind what they are. There are the messages about family and the environment, but in general I think it is far more effective to provoke a reaction than to state the obvious.\" It's a refreshingly undidactic approach, especially given that Colfer, the son of teachers and the product of Wexford Christian Brothers School, still considers himself to be a teacher, and intends to return to the classroom when he has the chance. He does, after all, owe it quite a debt, since it was in the classroom that he perfected his storytelling skills. \"I have always loved literature and did my best to pass this on to my students. Usually this meant reading at the end of every day. Sometimes, when their attention flagged, I would add a bit here and embellish a slow passage there. Eventually I discarded the books altogether and was telling stories from memory. It was only a short step from there to writing down my own stories.\" The oral practice paid off. Colfer's audience grew from one small class to hundreds of thousands of readers worldwide all waiting to hear what Artemis Fowl will do next. Can he pull that off too? \"Luckily I'd written most of [the sequel] Artemis Fowl: The Arctic Incident before the first book came out, so it was not affected by the subsequent hype.\" But with Puffin renaming yesterday as \"Fowl Friday\" in his honour and laying on a glorious secret-agent hunt for a discerning groups of children, the ground is already prepared for another bestseller."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
