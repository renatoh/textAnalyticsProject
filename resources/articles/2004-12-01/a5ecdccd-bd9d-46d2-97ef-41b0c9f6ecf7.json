Arsenal's manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger indicated last week that talks would be concluded in \"the next few months\" but the process will be accelerated by the two parties' willingness to reach an amicable agreement. Real Madrid were linked with a \u00a314m bid for the England international to become the replacement for Roberto Carlos. However, with 2 years remaining on his current contract, Arsenal are relaxed about retaining their left-back; that, though, will require a significant hike to his basic salary. That is reportedly less than \u00a320,000 a week but Wenger has declared his club willing to meet any reasonable demand and negotiating terms will be down to the vice-chairman David Dein when he returns from his Christmas holiday. \"We are now in talks,\" said Cole's agent Jonathan Barnett. \"We hope something will be sorted in January. I very much think it can happen.\" Freddie Ljungberg presented Arsenal with an unusual injury worry. A migraine kept him out of the Champions League match on December 7 and he did not return to the line-up until the Boxing Day win over Fulham. The problem has given the Swede and the club plenty to think about. Neither party will favour a rushed attempt at a comeback in future. \"The doctors told me I had to be off for a week to 10 days,\" said Ljungberg, \"but we had the Chelsea game four or five days later and I really wanted to play in that one. So I rushed it a bit and had another attack and had to take it easy for a week. The doctor told me I'd been stupid and should have known better.\" Arsenal sent him to a neurologist but Ljungberg already understood how severe his condition can be. \"It is concerning when it happens to me,\" he said. \"I throw up and lose my vision and also lose all the feeling in my hands. \"It's quite severe in that way, although I know what it is because it's something I've had since I was 14. It was 2 years since the last one.\" Thierry Henry has been named French player of the year for the second year in a row by France Football magazine. Birmingham City's manager Steve Bruce has identified Burnley's Robbie Blake as the player to augment his depleted roster of forwards. Bruce has inquired about the 28-year-old, who is valued by his club at \u00a31.5m and can play as a striker or on the wing. He hopes to complete the deal during the forthcomimg transfer window although will face competition from Wigan who have long courted the player."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
