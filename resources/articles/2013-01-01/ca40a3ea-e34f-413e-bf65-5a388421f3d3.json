The right formula is helpful. Cream shadow won't drop irritating, magnified particles into your eyes as powder can. Ditto tubing mascaras, which use polymers to bind to lashes and don't flake. However, the most important thing for any specs wearer is to get some great brows. They frame both your face and your glasses, and a good, arched shape is a game-changer. Mine are threaded, but even if tweezing, I strongly recommend getting a professional to do your initial shaping (you can use it as a template later). You'll also need a good under-eye concealer. Glasses magnify dark circles and cast further shadow. I suggest a slightly highlighting cream that gives decent coverage and some moisture to the skin. Don't wear blusher too high \u2013 the specs will cut it off midway, which looks odd to me. Finally, for goodness sake, don't think you shouldn't wear eye makeup. My advice is go strong but simple. Fussy blends of shadow are wasted, but a bold coloured or black liner (especially when tight to the lashline) looks fantastic and stops your eyes taking a back seat. Strong lipstick with bold glasses is also a brilliant look. It's like your painted lips have finally met their match. Smashbox Waterproof Shadow Liner, \u00a317, boots.com I adore these. Creamy powder-finish crayons of lovely, bold colour that are low on flake but huge on impact. Clinique Bottom Lash Mascara, \u00a311, clinique.co.uk Ignoring your bottom lashes makes them seem to vanish. I am never without this. Est\u00e9e Lauder Double Wear Mascara, \u00a320, johnlewis.com I know I bang on, but if smudging and flaking is your woe, this will change your life. Miss Sporty Just Clear Mascara, \u00a32.99, boots.com Never buy expensive brow gel because it's essentially hair gel in a mascara tube. Benefit Creaseless Cream Eyeshadow/Liner, \u00a312.60, benefitcosmetics.co.uk These are your friend. Use singly, stroked up to the crease. Liz Earle Light Reflecting Concealer, \u00a315.50, uk.lizearle.com One of the few concealer pens I've found that actually covers as well as brightens."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
