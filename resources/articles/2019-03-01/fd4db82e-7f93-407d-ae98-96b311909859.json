New Zealand police said that, as of Tuesday night, at least 37 firearms had been handed in to police officers around the country. The prime minister is expected to announce changes to gun laws in the coming days, including measures such as a ban on semi-automatic rifles, a plan that was flagged by her attorney general, David Parker, one day after the massacre. She emerged from a long cabinet meeting on Monday, Jacinda Ardern said her team would take the rest of the week to work out the details after agreeing to make changes \u201cin principle\u201d, adding: \u201cThese aren\u2019t simple areas of law. So that\u2019s simply what we\u2019ll be taking the time to get right.\u201d Ardern encouraged people to surrender their firearms to police and advised anyone considering buying a gun to wait a few days to get some certainty on the laws before investing. \u201cAs the prime minister announced, anybody wanting to surrender their firearms to police is welcome to do so,\u201d said New Zealand police, who urged people to call first and alert police they would be coming in with a weapon due to heightened security fears. \u201cYou can contact your local police station or your local arms officer to get advice on the safe transport of the firearm to police. This will also enable our staff to be aware of your arrival ahead of time.\u201d One of those who surrendered a firearm, was John Hart, who has a 20-hectare sheep and beef farm north of Masterton. Hart, who ran as a Greens party candidate in the 2017 election, handed in his semi-automatic rifle to police on Monday in the wake of the shootings. Hart said that while the gun was useful for some tasks, it was \u201cactually too dangerous to have around as a weapon\u201d. \u201cFor me, it became that trade-off: is my convenience worth the risk to other people\u2019s lives by having these guns in the country? I pretty quickly realised there was no comparison. We\u2019ll cope without semi-automatic weapons, we won\u2019t cope without the people who were taken from us from these events.\u201d \u201cI recognise one person handing in a gun to the police is not going to change the world, but it\u2019s a start, the country is now one gun safer than it was before,\u201d he said. Hart said he was supportive of any moves to reform New Zealand\u2019s existing gun laws, which he said clearly had issues, given they led to the suspected shooter in the Christchurch attack being able to access guns legally. Fish and Game NZ, a key organisation in New Zealand\u2019s hunting lobby, also supported calls for a ban and buyback of military-style semi-automatic weapons and would support a limitation on the sale of high-capacity magazines, which could prevent people from illegally modifying a smaller capacity semi-automatic rifle into a military-style weapon. Fish and Game NZ chief executive Martin Taylor told Radio NZ that people did not need to own these weapons: \u201cThey are designed for one thing only and that\u2019s to kill people.\u201d Firearms officers said they had been receiving an increased number of inquiries from people who wanted more information about how any new gun laws, which Ardern said would be announced within 10 days, would affect them. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of inquiries over the phone from people who want to know what this will mean for them,\u201d said a firearms officer from Northland area."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
