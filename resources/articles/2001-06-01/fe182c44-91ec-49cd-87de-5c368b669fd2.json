Among the euro-items that need to be ticked off the government's to-do list is settling the governorship of the Bank of England. Sir Eddie George is due to step down in 2003, which sounds a long way off, but an imminent referendum may speed up the process if the government wants to put a safe pair of euro-hands into Threadneedle Street. The front runners are Howard Davis, head of the FSA, and the Bank's deputy governor, Mervyn King. Poor Mervyn may have cashed in his chips after his remark that the UK needs \"two to three hundred years of data\" to know if it has converged with the euro zone. Politicians facing the most important result of their careers don't want the country's top independent economic role taken by somebody who could hurt them with such quips. So Howard remains the leading contender. Of the outsiders, the government's chief economist, Gus O'Donnell, could be a runner, as could Martin Taylor, the ex-Barclays boss. Then there's the perennial Gavyn Davies of Goldman Sachs. Just about the only person who talks up Gavyn's chances is... er, Gavyn. \u0095 A posh drinks party was under way in the restored Wellington Arch - the room that used to be a police station - hosted by Barclay's, when Chris Tucker, the bank's head of PR, got up to speak. Half a sentence into her spiel the wine waiters interrupted, saying that speeches were boring, and launched into some popular musical classics - Puccini, Tom Jones. Tucker looked rather stunned - which was odd, as she confessed later, because she'd approved the singing waiters. The last word goes to one of the regular serving staff on duty: \"They weren't very good waiters.\" You can't please everyone. \u0095 Back with the euro, there's an interesting sideline to the appointment of Peter Hain as minister for Europe after this week's post-election reshuffle. Looking at Hain's background - especially his record of voting against adopting the Maastricht treaty - has suggested to some that he has something of the eurosceptic about him, with all that implies in the present debate over entry to the euro. What may be more relevant is that Hain is one of a very small number of ministers with any experience of running a referendum campaign: he did so in Wales on devolution, and was generally applauded for the way he handled it. That experience may prove invaluable. \u0095 A prize - if such an award existed - for \"least surprising story of the year\" should go to the lead story of today's edition of Marketing magazine. \"Conservatives in split with Yellow M\" reads the headline, Yellow M being the advertising agency responsible for the Tory election ads. One of their brilliant ads was the \"You've paid the taxes, so where are the police?\" billboards - which puzzled voters who thought the police were much more likely to turn up if you didn't pay your taxes. \u0095 It's wonderful to see young Simon Wolfson, kd lang lookalike and chief executive of Next, growing out of his chrysalis and writing letters to the FT yesterday, moaning about the euro. Presumably he can use the letter as coursework to count towards his A-levels. Well done. \u0095 From our nonsense on stilts department: an obvious candidate arrives, which not only has a silly subject - \"UK's reputation as an inventive nation is at stake, according to new research\" - but also quotes a man who is not so much a media tart as a whole media flan, Professor Cary Cooper. Cary's written a paper promoting inventiveness that has some first class platitude. Number one is: be prepared to take business risks. Number two is: ensure that management lead by... zzz. richard.adams@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
