The foreign secretary will say \u201cwe cannot and will not let it happen\u201d in a major speech on Wednesday marking the start of a series of interventions by cabinet ministers laying out the government\u2019s \u201croad to Brexit\u201d. The opening gambit from Johnson, who led the Vote Leave effort, has been billed as an attempt to reach out to remain voters, setting out the liberal argument for Brexit and why the decision should provide hope, not fear. However, his comments about betrayal have already triggered a backlash with accusations of hypocrisy from MPs who claim that it was Johnson who first engaged in \u201cdisgraceful scaremongering\u201d during the referendum campaign. In the speech, Johnson will say: \u201cI fear that some people are becoming ever more determined to stop Brexit, to reverse the referendum vote of 23 June 2016, and to frustrate the will of the people. I believe that would be a disastrous mistake that would lead to permanent and ineradicable feelings of betrayal. We cannot and will not let it happen.\u201d However, he will acknowledge that leaving the EU will only be a success if the government reaches out to those who have anxieties about the decision. \u201cI want to try today to anatomise at least some of those fears and to show to the best of my ability that they are unfounded, and that the very opposite is usually true: that Brexit is not grounds for fear but hope,\u201d he will add. Johnson will claim that Brexit could open the door to an outward-facing, liberal and global Britain. However, he will claim that a major mistake of the past was for pro-EU voices to too often ignore those who opposed membership of the European bloc and he will say ministers must not repeat that. \u201cIt is not good enough to say to remainers \u2013 you lost, get over it, because we must accept that many are actuated by entirely noble sentiments, a real sense of solidarity with our European neighbours and a desire for the UK to succeed.\u201d While Johnson\u2019s central aim is to unite those on either side of the referendum he will reiterate red lines for leading Brexiters, which he will fight for around the cabinet table. The foreign secretary will insist that it would be \u201cintolerable\u201d and \u201cundemocratic\u201d for British people to have laws imposed from abroad when they have no power to elect or remove those making decisions. That suggests he will fight for the shift as soon as the UK enters a transition period, which could be a sticking point in negotiations with Brussels. But Johnson will say: \u201cAnd there is no need for us to find ourselves in any such position. To those who worry about coming out of the customs union or the single market \u2013 please bear in mind that the economic benefits of membership are nothing like as conspicuous or irrefutable as is sometimes claimed.\u201d Johnson will argue plenty of non-EU countries have faster growth in exports into the European bloc than Britain, despite the UK\u2019s membership fee. \u201cIt is only by taking back control of our regulatory framework and our tariff schedules that we can do these deals, and exploit the changes in the world economy,\u201d he will say. The Labour peer, Andrew Adonis, said that Johnson was right that people were trying to stop Brexit, but it was because they believed it would be an economic disaster. \u201cJohnson lied to the British people about Brexit and its benefits two years ago, including \u00a3350m a week for the NHS on the side of his bus,\u201d Lord Adonis told the Guardian. \u201cThe feelings of betrayal are against him, Farage and Rees-Mogg \u2013 which is why the campaign for a referendum on his Brexit deal is gathering pace. The greatest national success now would be to stop Brexit, eject Johnson from office, and install a government determined to promote trade, prosperity and security with our European partners \u2013 and not undermine them, as he is doing.\u201d Chuka Umunna, the Labour MP and leading supporter of Open Britain, also hit back, describing the foreign secretary as \u201ctotally unqualified to preach about the perils of fear and betrayal\u201d. \u201cHe engaged in disgraceful scaremongering with his ridiculous assertion that Turkey was on the verge of joining the EU and he has already betrayed millions of people by going back on his pledge to secure \u00a3350m extra per week for the NHS. This is hypocrisy of the highest order,\u201d he said. Johnson set out his arguments for why Brexit could be seen as a liberal endeavour in a recent Guardian interview in which he claimed that the EU was first and foremost a political project rather than being concerned with abandoning trade barriers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
