But the day was once again marred by tragedy, after the English Derby winner and one of the pre-race favourites, Anthony van Dyck, broke down turning into the home stretch and was taken from the track in an ambulance. He was later euthanised. Seven-year-old gelding Twilight Payment led the $8m race early and managed to hold off a late surge from pre-race favourite Tiger Moth to give owner Lloyd Williams a seventh Cup win and star Irish trainer O\u2019Brien a second. O\u2019Brien won his first Cup in 2017 when Rekindling beat Johannes Vermeer, trained by his father, Aidan. And the younger O\u2019Brian came out on top again two years later after beating his father\u2019s horse Tiger Moth to the line. Jamie Kah, the only female jockey in this year\u2019s race and a pre-race chance to emulate her close friend Michelle Payne\u2019s groundbreaking 2015 win, finished third aboard English-trained Prince of Arran, completing an international clean sweep. Asked if he could put the win into words, Australian jockey Jye McNeil, who was riding in the Melbourne Cup for the first time, was overwhelmed. \u201cNot yet. There\u2019s too many emotions. It\u2019s a very big moment,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got goose bumps. I\u2019m absolutely stoked I could pull it off.\u201d Having led from the front in one of the most open fields in the race\u2019s long history, McNeil had a job on his hands to keep Twilight Payment ahead of a strong-finishing Tiger Moth, piloted by Kerrin McEvoy. Asked if he second-guessed his decision to lead throughout, McNeil said that was always the plan. \u201cThat was always, well, probably plan A,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it was more a little bit of pressure on me just to get it right. Thankfully, it all came off. \u201cI was trying not to use the whip too many times, for a start. And also I was trying to use my voice to encourage him as much as possible. It was a matter of hanging on, and he was very tough.\u201d O\u2019Brien, who was forced to watch the race in the early hours of the morning from Ireland, said his second Cup victory \u2013 over his father too \u2013 was special. \u201cObviously it\u2019s quite different and not what we would have liked and we would loved to have been there, but incredibly special,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever happens on the track stays there. Dad is delighted for me when I have a winner and I\u2019m as delighted for him as when he wins a big race. \u201cIt\u2019s very special to be able to compete in these big races and this year in particular, there was a time when we weren\u2019t sure if we would be able to have runners in Australia this year. So a very special thing we were able to compete in the race.\u201d There were just 23 runners by the time 3pm arrived, after the Danny O\u2019Brien-trained King of Leogrance was scratched from the race earlier in the day after being found lame. The race was run against an unfamiliar backdrop of empty stands and concourses after the public was barred from attending due to coronavirus restrictions imposed by the Victorian government. Horse owners were also told to stay away, while even some trainers, including Chris Waller, who had two runners in the race, watched on from a distance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
