The company chose Randy Newman's I Love LA: \"Everybody's very happy, cos the sun is shining all the time. It's like another perfect day. I love LA.\" I started listening to Randy Newman about the same time. I'd walk around London, fast-forwarding my Walkman through I Love LA, because it was my least favourite song on his Los Angeles album, Trouble In Paradise. It sounded like the 80s synth-rock version of a Nuremberg rally: \"Rolling down Imperial Highway, a big nasty redhead at my side. Santa Ana winds blowing hot from the north. We were born to ride.\" Even though I understood Newman's songs were like Agatha Christie novels, full of buried clues to their real meaning, I still didn't give I Love LA a second thought. Then I flew to Los Angeles, rented a car at LAX airport and immediately found myself driving down one of the streets Newman extols in I Love LA: \"Century Boulevard! We love it!\" As I looked around, it dawned on me. Century Boulevard is an unexceptional street, full of Burger Kings and car repair shops. And so, Miss Marple-like, I hunted down the other streets Newman lauds in the song: \"Santa Monica Boulevard! We love it! Victory Boulevard! We love it! Sixth Street! We love it! We love LA!\" They are all the same. The best word to describe them would be nondescript. It's like a Londoner singing \"Kentish Town Road! We love it!\" A worse satirist than Newman would have chosen exceptionally ugly streets to make this point. Instead he picked these unremarkable epitomes of the humdrum LA sprawl, which is why, I suspect, Nike had no idea it had inadvertently used such a caustically anti-LA song for its Olympic celebration. LA is a low-rise city full of concrete boxes. Each box might be a car showroom or a synagogue or a fast-food restaurant. Such is the homogeneity of these buildings, a bankrupt business could probably be replaced within hours by a small team carrying some prefabricated milieu. I stood on the roof of the Hyatt Hotel, slap-bang in the middle of LA, after dark. You have a 360-degree view of the city up there, and it is one of the most depressingly lonely sights you can imagine. Right up to the horizon, in every direction, all you see are the flickering lights of single-storey buildings. Another song from Trouble In Paradise, Take Me Back, is sung from the perspective of someone who has ended up living in a residential street just off Century Boulevard. Unlike the narrator of I Love LA, this man has come to understand the painful disparity between the myth and the reality of Los Angeles: \"Take me back,\" he sings. \"Please take me back. I don't want to live out here by this dirty old airport in this greasy little shack.\" The place he wants to go back to is his North Hollywood childhood, when he still believed in America's legends: \"My mother, my father, my baby brother and me, playing cowboys all day out there in the back. What a perfect family.\" Then he pauses, and adds, weakly: \"Hey, hey. Get 'em up, get 'em up.\" Still, there are parts of Los Angeles that really do seem like a beautiful dream; like the Hollywood fable made real. One is the Hotel Bel-Air in Beverly Hills, just up the road from where Randy Newman lives. I treated myself to a night there because the hotel is immortalised in his song My Life Is Good. The Hotel Bel-Air is set in some 12 acres of tropical gardens and courtyard fountains, with an enormous oval swimming pool in the middle. It is impossibly opulent. Nancy Reagan was having dinner on the next table to me. I ordered seared tuna with a lump of grilled fois gras on the top. It was the nicest meal I'd ever had. A pond at the entrance is home to the hotel's own swans, as white as the jackets of the bellhops who rushed to greet me on my arrival. I stayed in a big, peach-coloured poolside cabana, and I got talking to a woman by the pool who turned out to be Playboy's Miss Millennium. \"That's a thousand years,\" I thought when she told me of her accolade. It turns out that she only spoke to me because she'd somehow got it into her head that I was Paul McCartney's son. When I reluctantly admitted I wasn't, she didn't really talk to me again. In My Life Is Good, the narrator - who sounds a lot like Randy himself - is called for a meeting at the Beverly Hills private school his child attends. The teacher is concerned that the boy \" ... hurts the other children, and all the games they play, he plays so rough\". Randy's reply to her is: \"Hold it teacher, wait a minute, maybe my ears are clogged or something ... You don't seem to realise, my life is good.\" And then he tells the teacher a story about exactly how good his life is: \"Just this morning my wife and I went to this hotel in the hills. That's right. The Bel-Air Hotel. Where a very good friend of ours happens to be staying. And the name of this young man is Mr Bruce Springsteen. That's right, yeah ... I'll tell you what he said to me. He said, 'Rand, I'm tired. How would you like to be the Boss for a while?'\" And I have to say, irony aside, when you stay at the Hotel Bel-Air, your life really does feel good.
