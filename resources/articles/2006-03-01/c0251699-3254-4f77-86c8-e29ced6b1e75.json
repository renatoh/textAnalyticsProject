And so it proved as news filtered through that Chelsea legend Peter Osgood had died after suffering a heart attack while attending his uncle's funeral. He collapsed at a crematorium in Slough and was rushed to Wexham Park Hospital, but doctors were unable to save him. He was 59. A statement on Chelsea's website read: \"Chelsea FC's affection and esteem for the man the fans titled the King of Stamford Bridge could not be higher. Today is a very sad day indeed.\" With 150 goals in 380 appearances, he is Chelsea's third highest all-time scorer. Osgood also played for Southampton - leading them to a surprise FA Cup victory over the MU Rowdies in 1976 - before returning to Stamford Bridge. Saints president John Mortimore said: \"Ossie was a colourful character who will be sadly missed. His biggest asset was his skill. He did not have lightning pace and he did not much like running in training. But he had wonderful control - the ball would stick to his feet.\" Former team-mate John Hollins spoke for many. \"It's just such a waste,\" he said. \"He was a big character. He always had a good word for everybody.\" Everybody except Small Talk, that is - the humble Guardian Unlimited questionnaire famously got short shrift from the \"jovial\" King of Stamford Bridge: http://sport.theguardian.com/smalltalk/story/0,,1155736,00.html * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I need to analyse my personal situation and that of the club before making a decision. All I can say is that if I do decide to seek the job, it will not be because I'm seeking fame or newspaper coverage, I had all that during my own career\" - if it's good football and a life away from the paparazzi former world rally champion Carlos Sainz is after, the Fiver would suggest binning any thoughts of the Real Madrid presidency. ********************* AND YOU THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT THE GLORY... In exactly 100 days time, the Fifa Fifa Fifa Fifa World Cup 2006 will kick off. Yes, you heard us right. It's not the Germany 2006 World Cup. Or even the Fiver's hysterically funny Siemens Der Soccerball Achtung Schnell! Schnell! Schnell! Scorpions Wind Of Change World Cup. Instead, as Sepp Blatter made quite clear today, the tournament belongs to Fifa and its 21 official partners - and absolutely no one else. \"I need to be clear about this once and for all: the World Cup does not belong to Germany, this is not a German World Cup,\" Blatter blustered to top German tabloid Bild (think the Sun, but with armpit hair). \"It is a Fifa World Cup in Germany that cost us 1bn Swiss francs! (\u00a3435m)\". Don't expect Sepp to be harangued by bailiffs any time soon, however - according to Fifa's latest financial report, they'll have \u00a3200m profit in their coffers by December. All of which means that, despite considerable protests in Germany, fans won't be able to guzzle down Bavarian beer nor deep-throat meaty German sausages during games. Instead it'll be Big Macs and Chicken McNuggets all round (McDonalds are an official partner) washed down with Coca Cola or horrible, flat, weak, Beech-wood aged Budweiser. Not that Sepp cares. \"It was on the basis of these ground rules that you were given the World Cup,\" he barfed at his hosts, before sumo-ing the remaining protests into oblivion. ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Internazionale are hoping to swap Adriano and David Pizarro for Ronaldo and Guti. Or rather, Real Madrid are hoping to offload Ronaldo and Guti for a couple of decent players. The MU Rowdies are determined to sell Mikael Silvestre and if Spurs won't take him, Lord Ferg is hoping to get Lyon boss Ged Houllier's eyes whirring so fast that he won't spot Mahmadou Diarra being swapped for the bungling French full-back. Juventus are giving Thierry Henry the glad eye, but will settle for William Gallas, Steven Gerrard, Cristiano Ronaldo and Ruud van Nistelrooy. And Russian media reports suggest that managerial hobo Guus Hiddink has agreed to boss the country's national football team. * * * * * * * * * * STORY WE WOULDN'T HAVE BOTHERED WRITING IF WE'D HEARD ABOUT PETER OSGOOD'S UNTIMELY DEMISE A BIT EARLIER (OR, JURGENNA LOVE THIS) In the Fiver's experience, rejection means one of two things: getting a slap in the face and drenched with sticky alcopops; or receiving a curt letter that begins \"thank you for your recent application\" before concluding \"but we decided to give the job to someone who went to school with our managing director, you proletarian scum\". But Borussia Dortmund defender Christian Worns apparently has higher expectations, and so it was with shocked indignation that he today condemned Germany gaffer Jurgen Klinsmann for using a concise email to notify him of his non-selection for tonight's friendly against Italy. It was, according to Worns, \"clumsy, dishonest and cr*ppy\" of Klinsmann to use contemporary technology to send him a message that cruelly began: \"I'm sorry I haven't been able to contact you personally,\" before sinking so low as to add \"we are going to Italy with just three centre-backs. Please call me if you have any questions.\" Naturally, Worns chose instead to call the hounds of the German press and bark \"maybe my chances of playing in the World Cup would be greater if I asked my club manager to put me on the bench for the rest of the season\", an admittedly astute observation given that Klinsmann's preferred defensive trio includes Chelsea ballboy Robert Huth and Christoph Metzelder - the man Worns keeps out of the Dortmund team. To some in Germany, then, Klinsmann couldn't be more despicable if he went around torching lederhosen, praising the Sun and dissing David Hasselhoff. He's already alienated the country's entire fitness industry by using only American specialists and even suggested Germans don't know a good thing when they see it by appointing some Swiss bumpkin as chief scout. And two weeks ago he graduated from heresy to lunacy by claiming the position of director of football in the German FA shouldn't have gone to 1996 European Footballer of the Year Matthias Sammer, but to Bernhard Peters - an ice hockey coach. Who would have thought the usually efficient Germans would regret entrusting their team to a courteous businessman who lives in California and only watches the Bundesliga on TV? * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Police are investigating claims by lip-reading football fans that Steve Finnan racially abused Patrice Evra during Liverpool's win over the Rowdies. Meanwhile Real Zaragoza have been fined just over \u00a36,000 for the monkey chants their fans directed at Samuel Eto'o during Barcelona's visit. The club has promised to identify and punish those responsible, which could make for some very sparse crowds at La Romerada. Bongo FC chief David Sullivan says he has no plans to dump the club and buy up shares in Cardiff City, because he doesn't want to leave the Midlands as a failure. \"If we were where Blackeye Rovers are in the league, then it would be more likely,\" he said. * * * * * * * * * * WIN A SAMSUNG D600 PHONE Send your best sporting picture - Kevin Pietersen taking another ill-advised swipe at a cricket ball, Darren Bent shanking one over the bar ... whatever - taken with your mobile to the.gallery@observer.co.uk now.
