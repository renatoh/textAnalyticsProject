Jane Sanders was outside a detention facility in Homestead, Florida, along with several 2020 Democratic candidates voicing upset at the immigration policies of Donald Trump. Jane Sanders told the Guardian it was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d to see the Homestead facility firsthand and outlined what the Vermont senator \u2013 who is one of the 2020 frontrunners to take on Trump \u2013 would do if he won the White House. \u201cThe first thing \u2013 one of the things that he says he\u2019ll do as president \u2013 the first executive action he\u2019ll take is to shut these down, to shut down the child detention centers across the country,\u201d she said. Sanders said her husband has a forthcoming immigration plan informed by Latino staff members and immigrant activists. She also he had voted against legislation that led to the creation of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency in 2002. \u201cEverything that he feared has come true,\u201d she said, referring to the agency, \u201cand it needs to be abolished. We need a complete overhaul of our immigration system.\u201d Homestead, which is run by Comprehensive Health Services, Inc, a private, for-profit company, has become a backdrop for Democratic presidential hopefuls to rail against Trump\u2019s immigration policies while in Miami for the first Democratic debates. The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren also visited the site and climbed a ladder to peer over a chain-link fence enclosing the detention center for young migrants. Warren said she saw a sprawling campus with massive white tents, metal trailers, a soccer field \u2013 and organized in single file lines, the children and young adults who are being housed at Homestead. \u201cThis is not what we should be doing as a country. These children did not commit a crime. These children pose no threat,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWhat is happening at Homestead to children \u2013 what is happening is the direct result of activities of the United States government is wrong. It is a stain on our country and we must speak out,\u201d she added. Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar also arrived on the scene shortly after Warren departed. Democratic hopefuls Beto O\u2019Rourke and author Marianne Williamson are due to visit later this week. The California congressman Eric Swallwell documented his visit on Monday. \u201cThese children need homes, NOT a privatized prison,\u201d he said on Twitter. Their visits come as photos were published of a migrant father and his toddler daughter face down in the Rio Grande river, where they drowned trying to cross the border to seek asylum in the US and amid a fresh found of reports about the inhumane conditions that children are being kept in at border patrol stations near the border. Lawyers who had visited the facilities said children were being kept without adequate food, water or basic sanitary needs such as toothpaste and soap."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
