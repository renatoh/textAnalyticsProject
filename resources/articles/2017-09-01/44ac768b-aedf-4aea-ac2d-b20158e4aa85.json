It was the venue for the Doors\u2019 first London concert in 1968, concerts for David Bowie and Jimi Hendrix and a Spiral Tribe rave in 1991. But, last night, there was something different: Tommy Hilfiger\u2019s first London fashion show for 20 years. It ensured London fashion week finished with a bang \u2013 thanks to Gigi Hadid. Hadid, with her 37.5m Instagram followers, was the superstar guest that \u2013 were this a rock concert \u2013 would provoke the screams from the crowd when she opened the show. Her sister Bella and brother Anwar also walked in the show, to a soundtrack of 90s hip-hop. Hilfiger\u2019s choice of the Roundhouse as a venue recalls the 66-year-old US designer\u2019s early experiences of seeking inspiration in the British capital. \u201cI started to come to London when I was a teen because I wanted to explore the whole lifestyle and I was obsessed with fashion,\u201d he said this week. He found flair in British bands of the period \u2013 naming the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, the Who, Eric Clapton and Small Faces as influences. \u201cThey had a sense of style that was very different to anyone else,\u201d said Hilfiger. Subtitled Tommy Now: Rock Circus, the theme was \u2013 to use an appropriate term \u2013 turned up to 11: guests walked through the backstage entrance of the 1,700 capacity venue, flanked by roadie cases. The audience was A list: it included Lewis Hamilton, Neymar and Sir Philip Green. The after party featured circus performers and a turn from the Chainsmokers, the band that music journalists love to hate but have ability to take on the might of Ed Sheeran in the top 10. This was part living breathing advertising campaign, part shop window, part concert, part movie \u2013 it was streamed live online. While the clothes were something of a footnote to this extravaganza, they fitted in the theme too. With heavy metal style logos, hoodies and biker jackets, they looked like merchandise for a rock show. The show featured the designer\u2019s collaboration with Hadid along with the main collection. Other pieces included preppy checks, over the knee socks, oversized T-shirts and track suits. The colour palette was unmistakably American: red, white and blue reigned supreme. The collection was available immediately after the show \u2013 explaining why there were also beanies and padded jackets included. Hilfiger is a proponent of the so-called See Now Buy Now model, when clothes can be bought effectively off the runway. Last season, the jeans wore by Hadid sold out before the show finished. As well as finding them on the website this time around, consumers can buy on social media channels \u2013 with a \u2018click-to-buy\u2019 function on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat, allowing customers to \u2018snapshop\u2019. Hilfiger was an early adopter of social media in fashion. Through live streaming, he opens out the experience of a show - once a behind-closed-doors world - to consumers. A caption on the brand\u2019s Instagram advertising the livestream as \u201cTHE event of the season\u201d read \u201cwe saved you a seat\u201d. This strategy works. Tommy Hilfiger sales are up 7% in 2016 with sales of around \u00a3636m in the second quarter. The brand was bought by Phillips-Van Heusen in 2010, who also own Calvin Klein, for \u00a31.95bn. Hilfiger remained in place as \u2018principal designer and visionary\u2019. After this show, you might say it\u2019s a worthy title."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
