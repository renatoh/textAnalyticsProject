The quality of United's passing for an hour was as good as I've seen from them this season, especially the one-and two-touch stuff, and Kleberson had a major role in that. He was also a big reason why United's unusual midfield shape proved effective. They used a sort of diamond with him at its head and he laid the ball off quickly, supported Ruud van Nistelrooy and took his goal with great assurance. I was surprised by Kleberson's role. He's been talked about as a holding midfielder and in the World Cup he played more or less as an inside-right. Brazil used Cafu as a wing-back on the right and he would be one inside. I expect he'll be used in a variety of positions by United. He was so bright on Saturday that Blackburn couldn't lay a glove on him. Crucially, he wasn't afraid to have someone tight up his back. Instead of trying to turn and risk being clattered, he normally released the ball straight away and spun to rejoin the play. United outnumbered Blackburn in the middle of the park because their wide midfielders played fairly narrow, and they exploited that. There was always a spare man and Kleberson was quick at picking out whoever was unmarked, even under pressure. He's like Paul Scholes in that regard. Often Kleberson started with his back to goal and received a short pass from Roy Keane. He'd lay the ball off to, say, Quinton Fortune. And while Fortune was whipping a pass to Van Nistelrooy, Kleberson would spin, sprint forward and support the striker. If Brett Emerton came off the flank to try to even up the numbers in the centre, Kleberson was bright enough to pick out Gary Neville, who would advance into the space Emerton vacated. Kleberson's role is one United tried Juan Sebastian Veron in and Veron played it very differently. He often tried to hit spectacular long balls. His success rate was pretty decent on a good day, but Kleberson plays shorter and sharper."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
