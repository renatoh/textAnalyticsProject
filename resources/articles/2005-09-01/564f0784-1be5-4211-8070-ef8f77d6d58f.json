Her own compositions - which form over half of this set - include songs of lost love like The Lark, or the joyful Fare Thee Well, both of which sound as if they could have been around for centuries. She moves away from the traditional with No Names, a lyrically simple but effective song of parting, and the more thoughtful and drifting Moon Shadow, which shows off the sturdy playing from her acoustic band. The one surprise is that 1952 pop song You Belong to Me, which was revived by Bob Dylan on the Natural Born Killers soundtrack, and emerges here as a classic, wistful Rusby ballad. She's a great singer, not just a great folk singer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
