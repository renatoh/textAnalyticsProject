John Bercow interrupted while the chancellor was in mid-flow to tell the MP for North West Norfolk that the nation could do without having to listen to his thoughts on the pre-budget report. Darling had been discussing public sector pay and Bellingham, a shadow justice minister, had been talking loudly. Bercow asked the chancellor to stop and declared: \"Mr Bellingham, we have on a regular basis a running commentary from you. But the house doesn't need it and the country doesn't need it either.\" Bercow is constantly complaining about MPs making too much noise in the chamber. He believes that the public dislikes rowdy behaviour and is happy to name offenders in the hope of getting them to keep quiet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
