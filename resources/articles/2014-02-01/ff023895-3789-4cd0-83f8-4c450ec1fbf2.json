The interest of the pub trade has always distorted judgment like over-proof liquor when it comes to calling time on inebriation. Today, betting shops voluntarily assume parallel duties to discourage problem gamblers. The suspicion must be that the question \"Sir, is it really a good idea to stuff another \u00a3100 into that machine?\" will be heard no more often than \"Sorry, you've had enough\" is bellowed across the bar. Of course, a new industry code pledging to train staff to identify and tackle problem habits is better than nothing. But pedlars do not make effective addiction counsellors. The (slightly) more serious question is whether, through computerised prompts, users of so-called fixed-odds betting terminals can be \"nudged\" away from their most destructive habits \u2013 pre-committing to monetary or time limits, which software will then automatically remind them about. The answer matters, not only for the unhappy individuals involved but also for the communities in which they live. Over a dozen years, FOBT machines \u2013 which let gamblers stake \u00a3100 every 20 seconds on a virtual roulette wheel \u2013 have mushroomed, particularly on poorer streets. Last year, the Guardian exposed the concentration of the terminals in places where unemployment leaves fewer people with wages to wager. On Saturday, we report that twice as much money is being frittered away in the boroughs that can least afford it. Of the \u00a32.5bn being poured into FOBTs in poor British towns, \u00a30.5bn never comes back out again. So the terminals are achieving what might be described as \u00a3500m in reverse redevelopment. This 20% loss ratio is, on the face of it, tricky to reconcile with the seductive \"fixed odds\" promise of 97% being paid out. But that comforting claim assumes against all reality that players treat FOBTs as a one-shot game, rather than allowing the average 3% loss to compound over successive rounds. It disregards, too, the exploitative facility for the deluded to split stakes between supposedly lucky numbers, which can eventually only succeed in weighting the wheel against the punter. Cannier sorts can, by contrast, cap their losses much closer to 3%, and use FOBT receipts to explain away the proceeds of crime \u2013 yet another social toll. The imagined bookmakers' question about the advisability about stuffing an extra \u00a3100 into a fixed-odds machine admits of only one rational answer. But then the allure of these machines lies beyond the bounds of rationality. The odds on nudging people back to their sense are long. Reducing the limit on spending per minute would be a much safer bet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
