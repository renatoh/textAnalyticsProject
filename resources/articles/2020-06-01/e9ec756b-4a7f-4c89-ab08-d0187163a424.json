In an episode that also featured opposition agriculture and resources spokesman Joel Fitzgibbon defending his call for Labor to adopt the government\u2019s target of reducing emissions by 26-28% by 2030, and independent MP Zali Steggall attacking Fitzgibbon for his views on gas extraction, Canavan was pushed by host Hamish Macdonald about his \u201cinterests\u201d in the coal industry. Canavan\u2019s vocal support of the coal industry has included calls for new coal-fired power stations, despite his moderate government colleagues opposing the idea. But the senator pointed out he had disclosed his brother\u2019s senior position in the coal industry during his maiden speech to the Senate. \u201cI hardly started talking about the coal industry yesterday ... I have been elected on that platform, to develop our country and keep our jobs here. I think the best way of doing that is making sure we do not deny ourselves the cheapest form of power and energy,\u201d Canavan said. \u201cThe Australian people have never voted for net zero emissions ... We seem to try and get bullied into these positions that the Australian people didn\u2019t vote for.\u201d When asked why the government was able to accept experts\u2019 views when forming its coronavirus response but not when its climate change response, Canavan likened conflicting views of the impact of climate change to epidemiologists who differed on how drastic they thought lockdowns should be. \u201cThere are very, very different scientific views being put on this issue. So it\u2019s not quite right to say that we just accepted the science,\u201d he said, noting some experts have said governments are too strict, while others have said governments, like in Sweden, are too relaxed about lockdowns. \u201cThese are very hard questions ... And it\u2019s the same thing with climate change science. \u201cIf you read the latest IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] report, the level of uncertainty around temperature increases from a doubling of carbon emissions has increased in the last 10 years. Increased. There\u2019s no consensus on exactly what that figure will be,\u201d Canavan said. Canavan also criticised the Paris climate agreement \u2013 something he has called for Australia to abandon \u2013 arguing the agreement is \u201ctransferring industrial wealth from the west and from Australia to China, a country that\u2019s bullying and threatening us\u201d. Fitzgibbon argued \u201cthe market will never\u201d build a new coal-fired power station in Australia, and defended his position for Labor adopting the government\u2019s climate targets, \u201cif we can get there [26%-28% emissions reduction by 2030] without causing people economic harm, then surely then we\u2019ve got a stronger platform from which to sell a more meaningful policy\u201d. He also reiterated his support for coalmining \u2013 a significant employer in his electorate of Hunter \u2013 and said his backing of zero net emissions and support for the industry were not mutually exclusive. In calling for greater gas extraction to fill any shortfalls in energy production left by reductions in coal-fired power, Fitzgibbon said, \u201cour manufacturing plants will not compete either domestically or internationally if we don\u2019t get more gas out of the ground\u201d. \u201cDomestic prices will go up if we do not get more gas out of the ground. And I get angry when I see state governments putting bans or moratoriums on gas in their own states, and then importing it from other states, and allowing others to take any environmental risks that might be involved,\u201d he said. Steggall called Fitzgibbon\u2019s argument \u201ccompletely inconsistent\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019ve just indicated that you\u2019re committed to net zero. We cannot be increasing gas out of the ground ... gas is as high in terms of emissions as coal,\u201d she said. Fitzgibbon responded: \u201cDo you really think, Zali, really, that we\u2019re going to have enough renewables in the system to replace that baseload power and battery storage? No.\u201d Steggall replied: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Zoe Whitton, Citi ESG analyst and Investor Group on Climate Change, also criticised increased gas extraction, saying \u201cinvestors are very uncertain and hesitant about it\u201d. Macdonald asked Steggall if she was \u201cpicking and choosing\u201d when to use experts\u2019 opinions, after she cited chief scientist Alan Finkel\u2019s work when making a point earlier in the program, but later rejected his views on gas being a transition fuel in 30 years. Steggall denied she was picking and choosing when to rely on experts\u2019 arguments, and said she disagreed with Finkel on gas because his view was at odds with the Australian Energy Market Operator\u2019s integrated system plan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
