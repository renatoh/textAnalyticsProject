The England squad are due back from La Manga tomorrow but will not link up again until Sunday, when they will prepare for Tuesday's friendly against Serbia-Montenegro. With Matthew Upson on standby, however, Ferdinand is unlikely to be risked in that game. The Football Association is keen to avoid confrontation with United and has been in regular touch with the club's medical staff since Ferdinand was substituted in last week's friendly in South Africa. \"Rio Ferdinand worked in the gym today, continuing his rehabilitation from his knee injury with the medical staff,\" Adrian Bevington, the FA spokesman, said yesterday. \"He was joined by Trevor Sinclair, who had a dead leg, but will hopefully be back in full training in Leicester on Sunday.\" The FA is at pains to point out that Ferdinand is being treated no differently from the other main injury worries, Wayne Rooney and John Terry, who will also return to their clubs for treatment. However, the Everton forward came through a solo workout yesterday and may be ready for a full session next week. Everton's manager David Moyes is pondering sinking his entire transfer budget into an attempt to sign David Dunn from Blackburn, who rejected a \u00a35.5m offer from Birmingham this week because only \u00a33m was to be paid up front. Rovers would be tempted should Everton offer an initial \u00a34.5m for the 23-year-old midfielder. Moyes, who is also trying to extend Li Tie's loan for next season after his Chinese club upped their asking price, is keen to add creativity and goals to a midfield which failed to reach double figures last season. Sheffield United's Michael Brown represents a cheaper option than Dunn at about \u00a33m, although Everton's interest is only tentative. William Gallas has followed Terry in expressing doubts over his Chelsea future. The French defender has three years left on his deal but wants a significant pay rise. \"If another club offers me a better deal I'd think about it,\" he said. \"I wouldn't rule out moving.\" Chelsea's chief executive Trevor Birch has arranged a meeting with Gallas's agent for \"the next couple of weeks\" and also made similar arrangements with Terry's people. Teddy Lucic has joined Bayer Leverkusen after leaving Leeds, where he played 21 times on loan from AIK Solna last season. Shrewsbury have appointed Jimmy Quinn as their manager on a two-year deal. He left another Conference club, Northwich Victoria. Faustino Asprilla, the Colombian who almost joined Darlington last season, fired two gunshots into the air on Monday - blanks, apparently - while said to be urging his Universidad de Chile team-mates to try harder during training. \u0095 Wales's record 10-match unbeaten run ended in San Jose yesterday when a depleted side lost 2-0 to the United States. The manager Mark Hughes said: \"We'll have regrouped and be ready for our next Euro 2004 game away to Serbia-Montenegro in August.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
