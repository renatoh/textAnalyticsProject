Policies focused on closing borders will drive migrants to take more dangerous routes and push them into the hands of smugglers, the foreign affairs select committee says in a new report. The human cost of irregular migration made international partnerships essential, including with the EU, the committee said. The report comes just over a week after 39 people, now understood to be Vietnamese nationals, were found dead in the back of a lorry that had arrived in the UK via the port of Zeebrugge. The driver, Maurice Robinson, has been charged with manslaughter and trafficking offences, and a police investigation into a suspected wider trafficking network continues. Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the influential committee, said that until the UK left the EU it should continue to attend EU meetings on migration. \u201cThe case of 39 people found dead in a lorry in Essex shocked us all. The full story won\u2019t be clear for some time but this tragedy is not alone,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, hundreds of families across the world are losing loved ones who felt driven to take the fatal gamble to entrust their lives to smugglers. This case should serve as a wake-up call to the Foreign Office and to government. \u201cThe UK has been relatively isolated from the different migrant crises in recent years, but it\u2019s wrong to assume that we are protected from their impact. The UK has a proud history of helping those fleeing conflict and persecution and cooperating with others to protect human rights. We should lead by example.\u201d The report also raised concern that deals with countries such as Libya, Niger and Sudan to limit migration risked fuelling human rights abuses. It said such deals could be used as leverage by partner governments, as the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, had done recently when he threatened to \u201creopen the gates\u201d. The committee also said the fact that the Home Office was responsible for the UK\u2019s response to irregular migration could lead to the \u201cerror of focusing on preventing migration to the exclusion of other goals such as preventing conflict and promoting stability and respect for fundamental human rights\u201d. It called for more effort to negotiate future close cooperation on migration policy with the EU and an immediate return of UK officials to EU-level meetings where irregular migration is discussed. Other recommendations included the expansion of legal pathways to apply for asylum outside Europe and robust monitoring and safeguards to ensure UK funding for migration programmes in Libya did not contribute to human rights abuses. Tugendhat said the committee\u2019s inquiry had been cut short by the \u201cuncertain nature of parliamentary business\u201d, but that it hoped to return to the issues in the future. Irregular migration is defined by the International Organization for Migration as the \u201cmovement of persons that takes place outside the laws, regulations, or international agreements governing the entry into or exit from the state of origin, transit or destination\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
