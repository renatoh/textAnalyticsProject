Bratton told NPR\u2019s All Things Considered: \u201cQuite clearly, we\u2019re in a slowdown.\u201d \u201cIt is being corrected,\u201d Bratton continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve been taking management initiatives to identify where it\u2019s occurring, when it\u2019s occurring. I think the officers themselves have on their own been beginning to return to normal patterns of work, so we\u2019re coming out of what was a pretty widespread stoppage of certain types of activity.\u201d The numbers for police activity, especially for summonses issued for minor traffic offences or other offences such as marijuana possession or jumping the barriers at subway stations, dropped dramatically in the weeks following the 20 December shooting deaths of two police officers in Brooklyn\u2019s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighbourhood. Police and police unions have been at odds with the mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, over his apparent support for recent protests against perceived police brutality towards minorities and remarks about training his son, who is biracial, to be careful around the NYPD. At the recent funerals of the two officers who were killed in Brooklyn, police turned their backs on the mayor as he spoke. The most recent figures available from the NYPD, which are for the week between 29 December and 4 January, show summonses for parking and moving violations down around 92% from the same period a year before, and criminal summonses down 91.5%. That means summonses went from 4,077 in the first week of 2014 to just 347 in the first week of 2015. The transit police saw the starkest drop, with the entire department making 32 arrests in the first week of 2015, after making 751 in the equivalent week a year previously. The housing bureau\u2019s arrests were also down, with 80 compared with 377 a year ago. The housing bureau has over 2,000 officers. The patrol services bureau, the division of foot-patrol police, also saw a large drop in arrests, from 3,408 to 1,493, a drop of 56.2%. Overall, arrests were down 55.9% on the equivalent week last year. Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives\u2019 Endowment Association, told the Guardian: \u201cThe commissioners\u2019 comments today regarding a work stoppage does not involve detectives. The arrest activity of our detectives is at or close to the expected activity in comparison to the same period last year. \u201cKeeping in mind that last year at this time we did not have two police officers assassinated nor did we have protesters and demonstrations in New York City. \u201cIf there is any reduction in arrest activity by detectives, it is negligible and directly attributed to either their reassignment to police the demonstrations or the execution of their brother officers on 20 December.\u201d On 20 December, officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were shot and killed by a gunman who had posted threatening Instagram messages about the police. On the evening of the shooting, a memo was allegedly circulated among police officers, calling for a slowdown. Many reported it as having originated from the Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association, a police union. In a release on Tuesday, PBA president Patrick Lynch denied there was a slowdown in operation at all. A spokesperson for the PBA was unavailable for comment on Friday. John Eterno, a professor and director of graduate studies in criminal justice at Molloy College, and a former captain in the NYPD, told the Guardian it was \u201cpretty obvious at this point\u201d that the slowing-down of work within the NYPD was organised. One area the slowdown has acutely affected is the bail bonds industry. Brenda Lugo, the manager of IG Bail Bonds in Flushing, told the Guardian that while the holiday season is usually her company\u2019s busiest time of the year, business had dropped by as much as three-quarters. \u201cThere is a major slowdown,\u201d she said. \u201cCops are doing nothing about nothing any more.\u201d \u201cI actually witnessed a group of people fighting behind the courthouse,\u201d she said, \u201cand no-one got arrested.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
