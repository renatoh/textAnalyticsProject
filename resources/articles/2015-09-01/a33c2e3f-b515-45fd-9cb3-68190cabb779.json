Oxlade-Chamberlain seemed genuinely impressed as he elaborated on what he sees from Arsenal\u2019s Chilean livewire every day. \u201cThe one thing I would say about Alexis is that he\u2019s one of the most passionate and hungry individuals I know,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s his everyday mannerisms around the training ground, how he trains, his performances, how he scores goals, how he plays and how he defends from up front. These are all things that we can all learn, that everyone who watches football could learn from. I\u2019ve definitely put myself in the bracket of somebody who learns from him every day. \u201cHe\u2019s someone that loves football, just loves playing football, and being involved in and around football. That comes out in training. He\u2019s very passionate, very upbeat and is a massive character in the team. For someone that doesn\u2019t have amazing English, he manages to communicate so well to all of us and keep the dressing room upbeat.\u201d It is interesting to note how the S\u00e1nchez effect has become such an important touchstone at London Colney. It is not just in the business of seeking out goals on matchday that his impact is felt, as it was with a dazzling hat-trick at Leicester last weekend. Oxlade-Chamberlain explained how his \u201cpositivity\u201d rubs off all week. For some of the younger members of the Arsenal squad it is a resource that they would be daft not to tap into. Observing one of the most talented players giving his all in every training session, and analysing his own game to try to work on any marginal gain, makes a big impression. \u201cIf he knows when he\u2019s not at his best, which is rare, he\u2019ll always push himself to do as well as he can and he demands a lot of himself.\u201d That particular sentiment chimes with Oxlade-Chamberlain, who has a tendency to look negatively at his own game. Although the 22-year-old comes across as a very confident young man, both the manager and his father, the former England player Mark Chamberlain, have been known to talk to him about his self-belief, which can get quickly eroded. Wenger brought it up recently, as he thinks this is a key point in the player\u2019s development. \u201cI did see that and I chuckled because my dad says that to me a lot,\u201d said Oxlade-Chamberlain. \u201cIt\u2019s a valid point. It\u2019s definitely something for me to take on board and look to improve on.\u201d Wenger takes up the theme: \u201cWe spoke about it. I see him train every day, he is dedicated, focused, hungry. His dad said he lacks a bit of self-belief and I can confirm that because he is very critical of himself. That\u2019s positive and a sign of top-level sportsmen but you have to find the right balance \u2013 not happy with what you do, without harming the confidence. He is maybe not happy enough with his performance after the games and sees only what he has not done well, not enough what he has done well. \u201cLook, he\u2019s 22. He is in the English national team, he plays many games for Arsenal. You become a complete player at 23. From 23 to 30 is certainly where you are at your best. He has the future in front and a bright one.\u201d Olympiakos in the Champions League brings back some good memories for Oxlade-Chamberlain. It was in this fixture four years ago that he made a big announcement of his promise, scoring on his European debut to become the youngest English player to score in the competition. \u201cIt is a long time ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI can only remember the goal and feeling quite tired in the first half. I think I got a bit of a shock about the step up I had made at that time. It seems like a lot has happened in between that but at the same time, in my opinion, I would have wanted more to have happened in that time, so it gives me motivation and hunger to do more.\u201d Arsenal go into the game against the Greek champions with no room for error. It seems strange to refer to a contest on the second matchday as must-win but after a poor start in Zagreb, and with Bayern Munich back-to-back coming up next, Arsenal must beat Olympiakos. \u201cWe cannot drop points,\u201d says Wenger. Not easy, though. \u201cThese teams dominate their leagues. Olympiakos won comfortably on Saturday, they were safe after 20 minutes, when we were in a high-intensity game at Leicester. Mentally you cannot ease off before a Champions League game, as some others can. For example Dinamo Zagreb played on Saturday and they took three players off at half-time. I cannot do that at Leicester. For sure the Premier League is demanding and consuming energy wise \u2013 mentally more than physically.\u201d For Arsenal, the S\u00e1nchez school of motivation has to be the order of the day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
