Despite spending \u00a3185,000 on their team compared with Reading's \u00a33.1m, despite finishing five points below Reading in the table, despite having half as many fans in the crowd, Walsall proved big enough to win a return to the division they were relegated from last year after just one season's stay. They will be hoping for a longer tenure this time and if the grit they showed in twice coming from behind to win this game is anything to go by they stand a chance. \"It was not a classic game but it was a fantastic day,\" said their manager Ray Graydon. \"It was a great recovery. Am I looking forward to First Division football? No - I'm looking forward to my holidays.\" The perfect day was ensured by two Walsall goals of contrasting stature scored inside a minute at the start of the second period of extra time. Poor old Reading must wait another season to secure a level of football to match their smart stadium and lofty ambitions. Their players and fans were distraught. Reading lost the 1995 First Division play-off final and were on course for automatic promotion for much of this season. Now they must pick themselves again. \"We'll get our chins up,\" said their manager Alan Pardew. \"We have to come through it stronger.\" The first of the clinching goals was pure farce as a clearance from one Reading substitute, Barry Hunter, hit another, Anthony Rougier, on the head and rebounded into the net. The second, less than a minute later, was pure fairytale as Darren Byfield, one of the Walsall substitutes, turned cleverly about 25 yards from goal and uncorked a low drive inside the right-hand post. By such twists of fate are play-offs won. And lost. Reading had begun the brighter on a slippery pitch which did nothing to disprove David Moyes' concerns ahead of today's First Division affair. But slowly Walsall took a grip and it was against the run of play that Reading took the lead. James Harper launched a throw into the area, Jim McIntyre's flick-on found Jamie Cureton in front of goal and his shot squirmed under James Walker. Cureton's 31st goal of the season did wonders for Reading's confidence and they almost extended their lead three minutes later as McIntyre headed Sammy Igoe's cross against the bar. But Walsall, passing patiently, dragged themselves back into the match with Zigor Aranalde, Paul Hall and the veteran Don Goodman going close. And within two minutes of the restart they had equalised. Pedro Matias's cross from the left found no fewer than two Walsall players free on the far post. Andy Tillson headed the ball back across goal where the impressive Goodman, with a sideways kick and a Jimi Hendrix hairstyle, propelled the ball past Phil Whitehead. But Walsall could not build on their opening. Jorge Leitao and Tillson went close and though Reading tried to improve their width and invention by bringing on Nicky Forster and Anthony Rougier, the nearest they came to scoring in normal time was Igoe's shot wide. But if Walsall had taken the second half by storm, Reading beat them for impact in extra time. With just 46 seconds of the first period played they re-took the lead. Harper's long throw from the left was half-cleared to Phil Parkinson, who launched the ball into the area where Martin Butler's glancing header beat Walker. Walsall tried to revitalise their game with a triple substitution, almost equalising again when Tony Barras's goalbound header hit Harper and deflected over. But fate and Byfield intervened and Walsall now join Millwall and Rotherham as the promoted teams from the Second Division. It means there will be six midlands derbies in the First Division next season. And here is another quirky fact: Walsall became the latest team this season to win finals here with their fans sited at the Canton End of the ground. Port Vale did so in the LDV Trophy, as did Liverpool in the Worthington and FA Cups and both winners of the play-offs so far. Bolton fans are seated there today.
