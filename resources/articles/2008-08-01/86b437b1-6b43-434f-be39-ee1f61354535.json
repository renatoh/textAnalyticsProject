Whether it is there to make you laugh, or think, to examine your own life in a new light, pretty much every word in this skilfully constructed, mind-twisting piece is significant. Moor plays two characters: a blocked biographer, given to romanticism and fits of hyperbole, and a po-faced compiler of footnotes, who comments on and strives to correct the biographer's narrative. And what a peculiar narrative it is: just as he is losing all hope in his life, the biographer is sent an \"advance diary\" for the following year, packed with notes of events yet to happen, all apparently in his own handwriting. It sounds confusing, yet it makes a wonderful, warped sense on stage, where Moor creates a hilarious parallel universe in which there are JG Ballard-themed pubs, Buddhists ride a rollercoaster called Life (it ends - boom, boom - six feet under ground), and court-appointed muggers routinely inflict punishment beatings on the biographer's kleptomaniac cousin Josh. Moor's writing can be irreverent, inventive and hauntingly beautiful all at once, notably when he describes the biographer's on-off girlfriend, Meredith, as a woman who \"moves like a fading civilisation worried about her future\". Sympathetically directed by Erica Whyman, Moor is also a beguiling performer, at times all cartoonish, gangling limbs and rubbery expressions, then suddenly still and wise. By the time the biographer and his footnote shadow begin to blur, it seems that nothing happening outside in the real world is of much significance at all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
