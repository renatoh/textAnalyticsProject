The telecommunications equipment maker had to restate several years of profits and fired ten senior executives including former chief Frank Dunn in April 2004. The Canadian company is paying $575m in cash plus shares equivalent to 14.5% of its equity, although it hopes to recover some cash in lawsuits against its former bosses. Nortel is still the subject of regulatory and criminal investigations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
