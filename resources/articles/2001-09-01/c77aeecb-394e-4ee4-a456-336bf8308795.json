Thorpe comes into the squad in place of Yorkshire all-rounder Craig White who twisted his knee in pre-tour training last week and has been advised to rest for 10 days. Yorkshire fast bowler Silverwood replaces Leicestershire seamer Jimmy Ormond after he was diagnosed with tendinitis in his right knee. Chairman of selectors David Graveney said: \"While Graham Thorpe may not appear to be a like-for-like swap for Craig White, the selectors had planned to use Craig in the top three in the batting order in Zimbabwe and felt that we needed an experienced batsman as his replacement. \"When the squad was originally announced, Graham Thorpe was not included because his hand injury was still a cause for concern. But he has now been given a clean bill of health and we are keen to take Graham to Zimbabwe as he is very much part of our plans both for the next World Cup. Silverwood passed a fitness test on his injured right rib last week and will fly to Zimbabwe with fellow Yorkshire fast bowlers Matthew Hoggard and Ryan Sidebottom although Darren Gough will be absent from all of England's winter tours following his decision to pull out of the Indian leg. Silverwood made both his Test and one-day debuts in Zimbabwe as a 21-year-old in December 1996 and will be grateful for this opportunity to rebuild his stop-start international career. \"As we are already without our two major strike bowlers for this series as well as Craig White, we have decided to call up Chris Silverwood in order to give us the cutting edge that we will need with the ball in Zimbabwe,\" said Graveney. England leave for Zimbabwe on Wednesday, where they will play five one-day internationals and a warm-up match against Zimbabwe A next Monday.
