Faced with a blocked toilet or a curtain rail that needs hanging, most of us will call on men for help. Are we genetically predisposed to quake at the sight of a power tool? Or do we just have a healthy distaste for getting our (carefully manicured) hands dirty? In BBC1's Child of our Time , Professor Robert Winston asked members of a pantomime audience to draw a bicycle. The men and boys all drew something that looked like it would work. The women and girls mostly drew a disjointed impression of a bike, with a person on it. Apparently you can tell whether you are male- or female-brained from the comparative lengths of your fingers. But can this really determine your ability to put up shelves? My father used to give me toolkits and overalls as birthday gifts, when I yearned for dolls and pretty things.But I seem to have inherited some of his practical genes. I've grown to love tools, having realised that the ability to fix things depends largely on having the right one. But, although I can now work out how to tackle most jobs around the home, I still shy away from using the electric drill my dad gave me as a wedding gift. Speaking of gifts, the Barbara K toolkit (\u00a345), already a huge success in the US, hits Britain this month - the perfect Christmas present for the woman who has everything except the confidence to hang her own curtain rails. With her 'Solutions for Women' range of tools Barbara Kavovit says she aims to empower women: 'I want them to realise a tool is an accessory, just like a great pair of shoes. I wanted to combine a fab sense of style with a book, because a book is the knowledge, and knowledge is the power.' The power provided by the little booklet that comes with the kit is pretty minimal. The US version tells you in a simplistic fashion how to carry out home improvements of the 'Hang a small picture!' and 'Fix a wobbling fan!' variety. To put up a shelf in an American house it seems you just need a screwdriver and a spirit level. The British version will explain how to fix leaking taps rather than leaky faucets. The tools are a joy to handle - solid without being too heavy, with lovely textured handles designed for smaller hands. The hammer is a real object of beauty. The kits comes in a dinky blue-and-pearl iMac-inspired case. It's a good starter kit for anyone who would feel confused by the array of tools in a hardware shop. But one thing fundamental to British DIY is missing - the dreaded electric drill. Never fear. Barbara K's Power-Lite cordless drill kit will soon be available in the UK. And it really does take the dread out of drilling. You can carry the heavy battery part in a hip pouch, which makes the active part eminently wieldable, and it has screwdriver bits too. Kavovit has already made a fortune from female DIY-phobia. At 21 she decided to capitalise on the intimidation women felt when dealing with builders, plumbers and carpenters. She stood outside a shopping centre and offered to take on all those jobs around shoppers' homes that their husbands had been promising to do. 'I would have all these women call me,' she says. 'I'd look in the local paper and find the trade that matched the need. I'd pick the guy up in my car and take him to the job. He'd charge me $50, I'd charge the homeowner $75 and make sure the job was neat and clean. I put on a tool belt and felt like a sexy woman.' It's a classic American success story. Ten years later she was running an \u00a380 million construction company - the first in New York led by a woman. Kavovit says that while it is not in women's genes to do it themselves, they have always been made to feel afraid: 'If you have no knowledge, of course you are going to be afraid. The mission is to change the gene pool.' Hmmm. Not sure how she worked that one out. Of course we can learn practical skills; it's just a matter of making the subject interesting. Next on Kavovit's agenda is another great idea: a construction toy for girls. If my dad had encouraged me to build my own pretty doll's house instead of getting me to peer beneath the family car, I might have my own construction company by now. So join the revolution, girls. Get tooled up and claim your DIY independence. For starters here's a tip that could save you costly plumbers' bills over the Christmas break: About 90 per cent of blocked toilets can be cleared by repeatedly ramming an ordinary mop down them. www.barbarak.com Toolkit available from Selfridges, 08708 377377, www.selfridges.co.uk or Amazon, www.amazon.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
