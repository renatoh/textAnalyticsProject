It would emerge that the Swansea City striker had suffered a drop in blood pressure which led him to faint \u2013 as he has done previously in his career \u2013 and the incident was nowhere near as serious as that which affected Muamba, the former Bolton Wanderers player. He was stricken by a cardiac arrest and cheated death. Gomis received lengthy treatment on the field before he was taken off on a stretcher. He was later transferred to a London hospital, where he was kept in overnight under observation. He was discharged at lunchtime on Thursday and, with Swansea\u2019s players having been given time off as they have no game this weekend, he has travelled home to France. There is relief in all quarters that Gomis is fine but Friedel, the reserve Tottenham goalkeeper, said there was a moment when he feared the worst. \u201cI was in the dug-out, as I was for the Bolton game and, as soon as it happened, the first thing that went through my mind was Fabrice,\u201d Friedel said. \u201cAnybody who was here at the stadium [for that Bolton game] \u2013 and even those who weren\u2019t \u2013 would have initially thought the worst when they saw Gomis had collapsed. My first thought was: \u2018Please no, not again.\u2019 \u201cIt is not normal for someone to collapse. So we knew it wasn\u2019t good. But word got back to us about his condition after a minute or so. That\u2019s why there wasn\u2019t the same panic when he was brought off as there was with Fabrice.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
