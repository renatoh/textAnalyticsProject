It is the sort of promise to send a chill through the bones of even his most ambitious rivals \u2013 and Rafael Nadal, five years his junior, remains very much the best of those. On a night as cold as charity, Federer showed a clearly creaking Nadal no favours with an emphatic win in the ATP World Tour Finals. It took him an hour and 37 minutes to see off the Spaniard, 6-3, 3-6, 6-1, in a final that rarely reached the heights of Nadal's wondrous semi-final against Andy Murray the day before. It was no surprise that Nadal refused to use the exertions of the Murray match as an excuse \u2013 although he plainly looked tired. He preferred to acknowledge his rival's excellence, observing: \"At the beginning he was unplayable. I don't want to say I lost because I was tired. I lost to a very good Roger Federer. I had chances but it was not enough.\" Their career log stands 14-8 in Nadal's favour but another defeat would have made it eight wins out of the past nine for the man from Mallorca. Federer knew he needed the title as badly as any outside the majors \u2013 not least for the $1.6m (\u00a31m) prize money and 1,500 world ranking points. Victory, in front of 17,500 fans split roughly down the middle in their allegiances, delivered the most unambiguous messages to Federer's peers and doubters: Roger is going nowhere for a little while yet. He served immaculately in the first set, less so in the second and broke Nadal with relative ease in an anti-climactic third. It was the sort of clinical Federer masterclass we have come to expect: unfussed and irresistible. Federer started the season in familiar style, winning the Australian Open but a dip mid-season nudged him down to No3 in the world until he started winning again in the autumn. He can rest now in preparation for defending his title in Melbourne knowing he has again turned back Nadal's challenge on hard courts and rediscovered much of the magic that makes him special. \"As long as I can, as long as I'm healthy, eager, motivated, which I clearly am, [I will continue to play],\" Federer said. \"I've played 10 full seasons. Nine of them I made the World Tour Finals, so I've always had long and exhausting seasons. But I seem to enjoy it. I take pleasure out of travelling the world, playing against the best, challenging myself. \"So it's been an amazing career for myself. At the moment I have no plans at all of stopping, quitting, whatever you want to call it. I hope I can play for many more years to come. It's a goal anyway. I think it's possible.\" The observation of the week came not from the winner or loser last night but from Novak Djokovic after losing to Federer in the semi-finals. \"The ball listens to him,\" he said. That it does. And so, again, do the rest of us."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
