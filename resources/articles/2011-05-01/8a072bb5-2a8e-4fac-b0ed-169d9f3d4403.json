In 2007, we reviewed the governance of Fifa as part of our annual global accountability report, a research process in which Fifa, to its credit, fully collaborated. The organisation finished last in its class, and sixth from the bottom out of the 30 global organisations reviewed that year. We highlighted the lack of transparency and any rigorous evaluation of Fifa's organisational processes, including the practices of the executive committee. Clearly, these issues still remain. When reform does begin, we believe two key questions need to be answered. First, what action will Fifa take to ensure such illegal actions cannot occur in the future? Our research suggests it is the organisation that needs to change. Proposals we shared with Fifa in our briefings include a robust process of scrutinising and reporting on executive committee members' personal interests and actions, and transparency of the vote. More limited terms of office might prevent perceptions of entitlement. Second, given that the voting may have been distorted by bribery, what is the impact on the validity of the decisions for the World Cup venues? We take no view on whether the UK, Russia, Qatar or others are better placed to host the events, but clearly the integrity of the process has been undermined. Fifa is in dire need of an additional and, above all, independent referee, and when decisions taken are clearly wrong, Fifa should be held accountable.
