The United States has by far the world\u2019s largest number of confirmed coronavirus cases, with more than 730,000 infections and over 39,600 deaths. Many state leaders have said they cannot embark on Trump\u2019s recommended three-phrase programme to ease stay-at-home restrictions without a robust and widespread system of testing in place. Researchers at Harvard University have suggested the US should conduct more than three times the number of coronavirus tests it is currently administering over the course of the next month, the New York Times reported. Democratic governor Ralph Northam of Virginia told CNN on Sunday that claims by Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence that states have plenty of tests were \u201cjust delusional\u201d. \u201cWe have been fighting for testing,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have enough swabs, believe it or not. For the national level to say that we have what we need, and really to have no guidance to the state levels, is just irresponsible, because we\u2019re not there yet.\u201d Maryland, Virginia and Washington DC are still seeing increasing cases even as the center of the US outbreak, New York, has started to see some declines. Boston and Chicago are also emerging hot spots with recent surges in cases and deaths. \u201cThe administration I think is trying to ramp up testing, they are doing some things with respect to private labs,\u201d said Republican governor Larry Hogan of Maryland during a CNN interview. \u201cBut to try to push this off, to say the governors have plenty of testing and they should just get to work on testing, somehow we aren\u2019t doing our jobs, is just absolutely false.\u201d Several states, including Ohio, Texas and Florida, have said they aim to reopen parts of their economies, perhaps by 1 May or even sooner, but appeared to be staying cautious. The White House guidelines released late last week on reopening the economy recommend a state record 14 days of declining case numbers before gradually lifting restrictions. Yet in a series of tweets from Trump on Friday, the president called for the \u201cliberation\u201d of Minnesota, Michigan and Virginia, Democratic-led states with strict stay-at-home orders, and appeared to be the catalyst for protests backed by rightwing groups in several places, including Texas, Maryland and Ohio. In his tweet on Friday the president claimed without evidence that Virginia citizens\u2019 second amendment rights were \u201cunder siege\u201d after Northam signed into law tighter firearms restrictions a week earlier. In Austin, the Texas state capital, protesters called on Trump to fire Dr Anthony Fauci, the leading US expert on infectious diseases, from his task force tackling the pandemic crisis. Washington governor Jay Inslee, a Democrat who on Friday blasted Trump\u2019s tweets as \u201cunhinged rantings\u201d, and one of the most vocal critics of the president, reinforced his position on Sunday. \u201cI don\u2019t know any other way to characterize it,\u201d Inslee told host George Stephanopoulos on ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cTo have an American president encourage people to violate the law, I can\u2019t remember any time during my time in America where we have seen such a thing. And it is dangerous because it can inspire people to ignore things that actually can save their lives. \u201cIt is doubly frustrating to us governors because this is such a schizophrenia. The president is basically asking people, \u2018Please ignore Dr Fauci and Dr Birx [White House taskforce medical advisers], please ignore my own guidelines that I set forth,\u2019 because those guidelines made very clear\u2026 that you cannot open up Michigan today, or Virginia, under those guidelines. You need to see a decline in the infections and fatalities. And that simply has not happened yet.\u201d Pence insisted in an interview aired on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday that the country had \u201csufficient capacity\u201d for any state to go to the phase one level. But Hogan and others said the issue was not as straightforward as Pence presented it. \u201cEvery governor in America has been pushing and fighting and clawing to get more tests, not only from the federal government, but from every private lab in America and from all across the world. It\u2019s not accurate to say there\u2019s plenty of testing out there, and the governors should just get it done.\u201d Hogan said he was sympathetic to the protesters. \u201cI\u2019m frustrated also,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to encourage demonstrations. To encourage people to go protest the plan that you just made recommendations on, it just doesn\u2019t make any sense. We\u2019re sending completely conflicting messages out to the governors and to the people, as if we should ignore federal policy and federal recommendations.\u201d Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, where some of the earliest protests took place last week, once again strongly defended strict lockdown restrictions in her state, the 10th largest by population but third highest in the nation in terms of Covid-19 deaths. \u201cMy stay-home order is one of the nation\u2019s more conservative but the fact of the matter is it\u2019s working. We are seeing the curve start to flatten and that means we\u2019re saving lives,\u201d she said. \u201c[But] I can tell you, we could double or even triple the number of tests if we had the swabs and reagents. That\u2019s precisely why it would really be incredibly helpful if the federal government would use the Defense Production Act to start making these swabs and reagents, so we can improve testing.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
