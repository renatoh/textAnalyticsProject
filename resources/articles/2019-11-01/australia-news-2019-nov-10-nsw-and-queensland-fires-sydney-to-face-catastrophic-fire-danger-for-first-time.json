The warning was issued as more than 80 fires continued to burn in the north of the state late on Sunday. Three people have died in the fires and at least 150 properties have been destroyed. The number of properties lost in the emergency is expected to grow as fire grounds become accessible to crews assessing the damage. On Sunday afternoon, two emergency warnings were issued for fires burning on the north-east and mid-north coast of NSW. A fire at Bills Crossing, north of Taree, had already burned through almost 12,000 hectares, with the Rural Fire Service warning people in the Johns River area to seek shelter as the blaze approached. The other warning was issued for an out-of-control fire in the Mt Nardi national park, where people were advised that leaving early was their safest option. While some weather conditions were expected to ease late on Sunday and into Monday, both the Rural Fire Service and the Bureau of Meteorology warned that dangerous conditions were forecast for Tuesday. The Rural Fire Service issued a catastrophic fire danger warning for the greater Sydney and greater Hunter regions \u2013 including the Blue Mountains and the central coast \u2013 on Tuesday due to high temperatures, strong winds and dry conditions. Extreme fire danger is forecast in the Illawarra/Shoalhaven region, the north coast, the central ranges, the northern slopes and the north-western regions. The far north coast, New England, the far south coast, the southern ranges, and the lower central west plains are expecting severe fire danger. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, visited devastated bushfire communities on Sunday. The federal government announced that disaster recovery payments of $1,000 per adult and $400 per child would be made available immediately through Centrelink for people affected by fires in NSW and Queensland. Leo Generaux from Tinonee, about 12km south-west of Taree, said on Sunday he didn\u2019t know if he had a house to return to. He and his wife had been evacuated twice in three days and had been told his neighbour\u2019s home had been destroyed. On Sunday, Generaux, aged in his 70s, was at the Club Taree evacuation centre watching for the arrival of Morrison and Berejiklian. \u201cWe were allowed to go in on Saturday to see our home and our neighbours, waiting at our door, told us their house had been burnt to the ground. We were in a state of shock,\u201d he said. \u201cWe said, \u2018You can stay with us,\u2019 but they said, \u2018That\u2019s no good the fire hasn\u2019t finished yet,\u2019 and then in the afternoon we were evacuated again. There was a fire on the other side, the east side. \u201cThe smoke was billowing towards us and we got the phone call, \u2018Leave now\u2019. I have no idea if my house is still there. We left in a hurry, only one road was open. That\u2019s now closed. There is no way of telling what is going on at our property.\u201d In Terania Creek, near the Nightcap national park, Terri Nicholson spent Sunday watching fires move into private property on the western side of the valley and start heading south. Many residents in the immediate vicinity of multiple fires had been evacuated to The Channon, the nearest town. Nicholson\u2019s parents are Nan and Hugh Nicholson. Forty years ago they hosted the blockade that ultimately stopped logging of the rainforest near their property and saved rainforest in other parts of NSW. \u201cNan and Hugh Nicholson hosted the site of the Terania protest to defend this great rainforest from logging and now we\u2019re here defending it due to the effects of climate change,\u201d Nicholson said from her parents\u2019 property. \u201cI don\u2019t even have the words right now. It\u2019s just gobsmacking and distressing to witness.\u201d Nicholson said residents were preparing for conditions to worsen over the next few days. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing rainforest burn. There\u2019s fire threatening our houses right now,\u201d Nicholson said. \u201cThere\u2019s fire trucks, volunteers. The local fire service is incredible, they\u2019re protecting our home. This is the home I grew up in. My childhood home. My parents\u2019 land. \u201cIt\u2019s quite intense to see ancient, iconic rainforest burn \u2013 this delicate ecosystem \u2013 and see firefighters here risking their lives and just to see global heating in action.\u201d In Queensland, more than 50 fires were burning on Sunday and emergency warnings were still in place at Cooroibah and Ringtail Creek, north of Noosa on the Sunshine Coast. Fires had destroyed houses, sheds and cars and forced thousands of people to flee their homes. A firefighter suffered a broken leg but no lives have been lost or other injuries reported. The winds and hot and dry conditions that have stoked blazes are set to continue on Sunday, ease on Monday, and worsen on Tuesday, challenging crews and people battling to save their homes. The emergency warnings for Cobraball and nearby Bungundarra have eased but people are warned to be on the alert because conditions could get worse. They face an anxious wait to see if their homes are still standing because they can\u2019t return until it is safe to do so. Red Cross Queensland\u2019s emergency services manager, Colin Sivalingum, said it was a traumatic time for people in evacuation centres. \u201cMost people just want to go back home to see what\u2019s actually happening. That\u2019s making them very anxious. That\u2019s what they\u2019re telling us,\u201d he told the ABC. \u2022 Additional reporting by Australian Associated Press"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
