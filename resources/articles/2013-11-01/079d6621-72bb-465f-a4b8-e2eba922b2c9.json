Paolo Di Canio, Poyet's predecessor, was desperate to sign Huddlestone from Tottenham Hotspur but instead the sometime England midfielder opted to join Steve Bruce at Hull for \u00a35m. \"Tom's one of the few players, if not the only one, who can hit a ball 70 yards without moving 10cm. Left, right, ping it around, outside of the foot,\" said an admiring Poyet. \"He has got an unbelievable ability to hit the ball from side to side. It means he is very important in the way Hull play, in his delivery and shots from outside the box. Plenty of things go through Tom and we need to keep an eye on that. \"We need to use our strengths to make him feel uncomfortable. The game has got two sides \u2013 one with the ball and one without the ball. Tom likes to have the ball a lot at his feet. If he has it more than us, then we will have a problem.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
