Six artists square up in new battle of Trafalgar", "bodyText": "It could become the most desirable picnic spot in London - sitting, perhaps in the sunshine, on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square looking out on the throng of tourists. Or it could be a burnt-out car from Iraq, a scale model of HMS Victory, sky-reflecting mirrors or a 100ft tall illuminated peace sign. Or meerkats. Yesterday the six artists shortlisted to have their work in one of the most enviable public spaces in the country unveiled their ideas at the National Gallery for the first time. After standing empty for 150 years, the public has come to expect something to be on the plinth after the success of Marc Quinn and his statue of Alison Lapper pregnant, and Thomas Sch\u00fctte, whose fibreglass model for a hotel is currently the subject of tourists' cameras. It was Antony Gormley who came up with the most fun proposal. He wants the plinth to be empty except for volunteers who will stand on it for an hour at a time, 24 hours a day. Over the year he estimates 8,760 people would take part. He said Trafalgar Square was an \"outdated, valedictory, monumental kind of military space and it should be a civilian space. How responsible we are on the plinth is up to us. People can get drunk up there if they want, it's entirely up to them. The rule is you can take up whatever you want, whatever you can carry.\" The most overtly political statement comes from Jeremy Deller, who is proposing a burnt-out car that has been destroyed in an attack on civilians in Iraq - the idea being that from the Romans onwards the spoils of war have been presented to a curious public. He said: \"I've gone for something which is deliberately ugly and jarring.\" The most bullish of the artists present was Bob &amp; Roberta Smith (a pseudonym for Patrick Brill), behind what would be the most eye-catching piece. He is proposing a 100ft tall illuminated peace sign (Faites L'Art, pas La Guerre or Make Art, Not War) which would be powered by the sun and wind. \"Mine is the best proposal, it's as simple as that. All the advice I've had is that it will work.\" Anish Kapoor's Sky Plinth would have five large concave mirrors attached to the plinth facing upwards reflecting the clouds as they pass. Kapoor said: \"For some time I've been preoccupied with the idea of bringing the sky down to the ground, turning the world upside down. The mirrors all catch the sky. It should be really beautiful.\" Yinka Shonibare is proposing a piece called Nelson's Ship in a Bottle, which would be a scale replica of HMS Victory, in a bottle, and address issues of multiculturalism. \"It's a celebration of London's immense ethnic wealth, giving expression to and honouring the many cultures and ethnicities that are still breathing precious wind into the sails of the UK.\" Tracey Emin's proposal is titled Something for the Future, and consists of a sculpture of four meerkats \"as a symbol of unity and safety\". Emin was the only artist not present at the launch yesterday but her publicity material said she had noticed that \"whenever Britain is in crisis or, as a nation, is experiencing sadness and loss (for example, after Princess Diana's funeral), the next programme on television is Meerkats United\". The winner will be announced in the spring by a panel chaired by Sandy Nairne, director of the National Portrait Gallery, which also includes the broadcaster Jon Snow and artist Grayson Perry. The panel will also hear comments from a vox-pop kiosk at the National Gallery exhibition of the proposals as well as an online comment forum at fourthplinth.co.uk."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
