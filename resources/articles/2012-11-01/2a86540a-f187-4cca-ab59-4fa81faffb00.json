Images of wordsmiths at typewriters have this in common: a look of deranged concentration. They were, after all, embarked on something difficult, a task where mistakes had consequences. When cut and paste required real glue, it was as well to think before writing; and \u2013 confronting a keyboard which couldn't tweet, poke or share \u2013 you'd half a chance of doing that. Perhaps such discipline will one day be venerated, and literary threads drawn through the 1880-1980 typewriting century. Until then, there are other reasons to mourn the last British machine rolling off the assembly line this week. The weight of the keys, the thud of the arms and the ring of return \u2013 all made typewriters a technology we could grasp.
