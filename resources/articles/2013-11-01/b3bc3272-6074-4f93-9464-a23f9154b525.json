Australia and Argentina are Rugby Championship sides, after all. And there is a lot of newness about England. You would not have heard much of that filing out of Twickenham after this one, though. Perhaps a bit more of it than you would have without Ben Morgan's try a couple of minutes from time, which added that sheen of perfect respectability, but as the second half wore on the credit England had built up in a very definitely impressive first half started to dwindle. Twickenham's famously angry clientele went from doing their best to swallow their disgruntlement as Argentina grew into their game to unashamedly cursing and groaning as England's unannounced hesitancy lingered on in the final quarter. If you were being charitable you might put it down to a convoluted attempt to lull the All Blacks into a false sense of security, ahead of their visit for England's third and final autumn international next Saturday. England have done that before. Let's be realistic, though. This Argentina side gathered at the start of this week from all corners. They should be match-hardened, having finished their Rugby Championship campaign a month ago. But in the interim, their head coach has resigned, grumbling about cliques among the squad, they have lost to injury an almost hand-picked coterie of their most important players, and they were all scattered across Europe last weekend, playing for their respective clubs. So we can allow them a dodgy first 40 minutes. England, though, to their credit, did not. The pace with which they played at times in the first half was the snappiest yet this autumn. Plenty of players had much to play for. Anyone given the No9 shirt in this England team these days needs to work extra hard to keep it, and Lee Dickson was the sharp-handed maestro maintaining that pace. Disrupted or not, no Argentina side will be anything less than a grappling nuisance at close quarters, but Dickson was quick to each breakdown and thence away with the ball to any number of targets presenting themselves. If England now brandish any weapons greater than those on show in the Six Nations it is in the ball-carrying department, even without the injured Manu Tuilagi. Billy Vunipola provides much of it, but Dylan Hartley, David Wilson, Joe Marler and Courtney Lawes made notable dents in the defence. Hartley came away with the man-of-the-match award, and well deserved, rendering the decision at hooker Stuart Lancaster's most delicate. Lawes, too, after a rude steal against him early on, supplemented his work round the field with a towering display in the lineout. Chris Robshaw and Tom Wood were industrious throughout, even if the latter's discipline in the second half created problems. And Joe Launchbury played in much the same vein, crowning his performance with the game's first try, a finely worked lineout and drive. A new-look pack it may have been, thriving on this opportunity, but the scrum was an obvious problem. No shame there against Argentina, even missing Juan Figallo, but when England's four Lions were introduced in the second half the scrum not only righted itself it started to dominate. Alex Corbisiero and Dan Cole are nothing if not likely to start against New Zealand. As so often, though, it is behind the scrum where England struggle. Even during the highs of the first half, there was a feeling that England should have made more of the forwards' first-half dominance. Billy Twelvetrees had a lot to exorcise from last week, which he did to a degree. He was a man on a mission as he hurtled through three defenders on the way to England's second try. It was a move hardly flowing in its elegance. From an attacking scrum, with England's forwards on the rampage, the ball went to the floor after a miscommunication between Owen Farrell and Chris Ashton, but the latter flipped it up to Twelvetrees, and away he went. For Ashton, it was another mixed afternoon. He, more than anyone, has been under fire of late. He, more than anyone, needed to take advantage of his selection for this one. Perhaps he is trying too hard. He should have scored early on, when he came off his right foot a few yards from the line, but he slipped and could not get the ball down for the try. No matter, he was to score just before half-time, but, again, it was not the score of a confident man. He rushed blind with Farrell well, but even though he had a clear run-in to the corner he took an age to dot the ball down, only just managing to do so before sliding into touch. Such edginess was to spread throughout the team in the second half, so that the game meandered into one of those dispiriting, colourless affairs well known to Twickenham. Still, they want to turn this place into a fortress, and that's another win to tick off. No one will be fooled that it was anything more than a job done, but, as always, it is by the battle with those invaders in black that will be remembered this autumn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
