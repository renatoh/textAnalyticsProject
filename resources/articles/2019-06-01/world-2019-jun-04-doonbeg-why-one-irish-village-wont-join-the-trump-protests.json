The village of Doonbeg in County Clare has erected US flags and plans to give a mighty cheer if the presidential cavalcade swooshes past. Trump, after all, is making Doonbeg great again. The village, population 262, abuts the US president\u2019s 400-acre hotel and golf resort, an opulent visitor magnet sprayed by Atlantic ocean waves. \u201cThe people are 99.9% behind him,\u201d said Fr Joe Haugh, the parish priest. \u201cThere\u2019s no one else doing for us what he\u2019s doing.\u201d For locals it is an economic lifeline, a source of jobs, investment and hope. Without Trump, they say, the village and surrounding communities would wither. \u201cHe\u2019s the biggest employer in west Clare,\u201d said Martin Kelly, 48, a trucking company owner who receives business from the resort. \u201cHe has done a brilliant job. He\u2019s keeping west Clare going. Doonbeg would be a different place if he wasn\u2019t here.\u201d The president and his wife, Melania, are due to stay at the resort from 5-7 June following a two-day state visit to the UK filled with Buckingham Palace pomp and D-day commemorations. Activists have promised big demonstrations against Trump\u2019s policies on the environment, immigration and other issues. Irish activists also plan to mobilise. Ireland is shaping up to be a haven and potential irritant for the president. He will bypass Dublin and fly into Shannon airport, 40 miles from his resort. After meeting the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar \u2013 who in 2014 gave Trump a sympathetic hearing over a windfarm concern \u2013 the US president will be free to savour golf, ocean views and the gratitude of locals. The Trump International Organisation bought the resort, with fairways designed by Greg Norman, in 2014. It has spent \u20ac40m, including the purchase price, on expanding and upgrading facilities, which include a spa, restaurants and cottages. Trump has visited six times, calling the resort \u201cterrific\u201d and \u201cincredible\u201d. Protesters are planning a rally in Dublin and possibly a \u201cpeace camp\u201d at Shannon but are expected to steer clear of Doonbeg. Security will be tight \u2013 a no-fly zone, road closures, \u201csniper towers\u201d, soldiers, police and secret service agents. Police reportedly quizzed workers at Shannon industrial estate asking if they had any \u201canimosity\u201d towards the visitor. \u201cNobody was declaring any negatives towards Donald Trump,\u201d one employee told the Clare Echo. Should the president wander around Trumpland\u2019s Irish outpost he will experience psychological balm, for here he is a hero. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it. It would be great to see him,\u201d said Kathleen Whelan, who runs Doonbeg\u2019s grocery shop. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day a US president comes here. It\u2019s all good.\u201d Sean O\u2019Donnell, a local contractor, said he had friends and relatives among the 310 people employed at the resort during summer. \u201cHe\u2019s brought jobs and investment, just what we need.\u201d O\u2019Donnell also praised Trump as a straight shooter. \u201cOther politicians lie. He tells it like it is.\u201d Not everyone would agree with that. The Washington Post has tracked more than 10,000 lies and misleading claims made by the president since taking office. The casino mogul won the White House partly by promising to save dying rustbelt communities in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Keeping that promise has proved hard \u2013 he does not control global economic trends. But for Doonbeg his wallet is enough. Trump\u2019s resort contributes a \u201cseismic\u201d \u20ac8m per annum to the local economy, said an editorial in the Clare Champion newspaper. Without Trump a region that is losing jobs, post offices and population \u201cwould be further bereft\u201d, it said. There is, however, a snag. Storms and rising sea levels are eroding dunes that dot the golf course, damaging fairways and threatening the entire course. Trump executives have applied to build a protective coastal wall \u2013 evidence the president will act on climate change when it threatens his business interests. Clare county council approved a scaled-down plan for 38,000 tonnes of rock to form two barriers of 630 metres and 260 metres in length in front of Doughmore beach. Locals in Doonbeg support the plan, saying it will protect farmland from flooding. But environmental groups have stalled it, saying the flood risk is overstated and that the barriers would harm wildlife and the dune system. An Bord Plean\u00e1la, a planning regulator, is expected to rule on the case later this year. \u201cI am confident \u2026 this wall will not go ahead,\u201d said Peter Sweetman, a veteran campaigner who has led opposition to other projects in the west of Ireland. Tony Lowes, of Friends of the Irish Environment, said the group hoped to deliver to the resort an online petition of 100,000 signatures against the plan. \u201cThis proposal threatens the whole evolution of one of our most important dune systems. They have no business messing with it.\u201d Environmental objections blocked a separate attempt by the resort two years ago to build new facilities. Trump called it \u201ca very unpleasant experience\u201d. Defeat over the sea barriers would tee up another one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
