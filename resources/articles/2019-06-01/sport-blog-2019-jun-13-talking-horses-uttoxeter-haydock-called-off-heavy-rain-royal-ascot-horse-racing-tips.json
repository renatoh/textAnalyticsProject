Too Darn Hot finished his two-year-old season unbeaten in four races but missed the 2,000 Guineas in early May due to injury and has been beaten in his two outings since, first in the Dante Stakes at York and then, just nine days later, in the Irish 2,000 Guineas. \u201cHe\u2019s been probably the worst-managed horse this year,\u201d Gosden said. \u201cWe sent him to the Dante when quite frankly he was 80%. Frankie [Dettori] was trying to settle him further back and ignored the pacemakers and consequently he got there to be second. \u201cThen, very stupidly because we seemed to be missing all the Classics, we took him over nine days later to Ireland and we had to give him a flu vac [before travelling]. In the rules, he was perfectly eligible to race in England but not in Ireland as they\u2019ve changed the rules, so we gave him a flu vac on the Saturday and ran him on the following Saturday, as he wouldn\u2019t have been allowed into the racecourse stables otherwise. \u201cHe ran very well [to finish second to Phoenix Of Spain] but we were asking the horse to do impossible things. It would have been much better if I\u2019d simply targeted the Irish Guineas with him.\u201d Phoenix Of Spain, who made all the running to win at The Curragh, is the 7-4 favourite to confirm the form next Tuesday while Too Darn Hot is 7-2 to register his first success of the campaign and another Gosden-trained runner, King Of Comedy, is 6-1. \u201cHaving said all that, he\u2019s coming up to this race in good form,\u201d Gosden said, \u201cand I hope he shows the quality he has as he certainly hasn\u2019t had an opportunity with his more than interrupted preparation this spring. \u201cLast year went so smoothly that it was nearly ridiculous \u2013 maiden, Group Three, Group Two, Group One \u2013 but this year has been quite the opposite. But the good news is that we\u2019re only halfway through the season so there\u2019s still a lot to look forward to.\u201d Runners from outside Europe are now a familiar sight at Royal Ascot, drawn from across the globe to run in the two sprint events \u2013 the King\u2019s Stand Stakes and Diamond Jubilee Stakes \u2013 in particular, although Australian representation this year is down to just a single runner, Houtzen, in the King\u2019s Stand. The recent arrival of the $13m Everest in Australia\u2019s sprinting schedule in October may be one reason for the drop-off in their team for the meeting but Toby Edmonds and Houtzen\u2019s owners decided to \u201ccome over here and chance our arm\u201d instead. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a big field and very competitive, but our filly is very, very sharp,\u201d Edmonds said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s been great to us and I must thank Chris Stickels at Ascot for allowing us to get in [for a racecourse gallop last month]. It\u2019s a testing track and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here so early, we don\u2019t have that type of track back home, with the inclines and all the rest of it. We\u2019ll see what we draw on Sunday, but she\u2019s pretty quick so we\u2019ll be happy to take a sit off them and then she\u2019ll be strong late and she\u2019s quite tough to get past.\u201d Wesley Ward, who has trained 10 Royal Ascot winners from his American base since 2009, expects to have at least half a dozen runners at the meeting including the juveniles Nayibeth, Maven, who is from the first crop of American Pharoah, the 2015 Triple Crown winner, and Anna\u2019s Fast. His compatriot Joe Orseno, meanwhile, will be making his debut at the Royal meeting when he saddles Imprimis, a live 12-1 chance, in the King\u2019s Stand Stakes with Frankie Dettori booked for the ride. Thursday\u2019s best bets Haydock, which raced on Wednesday, was doomed after a further 10mm of rain overnight, while Uttoxeter reported via Twitter that the track has received 100mm of rain in the last 10 days and that there are large areas of standing water on the course. Friday\u2019s card at Newton Abbott has been called off owing to waterlogging while Saturday\u2019s meeting at Leicester is already under threat with the racecourse reporting on Twitter that, \u201cover the last four days we have had the same amount of rain as the whole of 2018. As a consequence, we are having the course inspected on Friday at 2pm.\u201d The fixtures at Nottingham and Yarmouth have survived, however, which means that there is at least a full afternoon programme, albeit on heavy ground at both courses and soft going at Newbury. There are some interesting contests at the latter track, however, and a very promising individual in John Gosden\u2019s Terebellum (3.00), who makes the second start of her career in the Listed Johnnie Lewis Memorial Stakes over 10 furlongs. The first was an impressive success at Goodwood three weeks ago when the beaten horses included a runner-up who has won since and it will be disappointing if Terebellum cannot build on that on the way to Group races. Infanta Isabella (3.35) has form with cut in the ground and could be the answer to the handicap over the straight mile, while Urban Highway (4.10) is also a fair price later on. Global Melody (3.45) is the pick of the prices at Nottingham while Junior Rip (3.25) should go well at Yarmouth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
