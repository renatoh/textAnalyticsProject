NO, HE\u2019S SHERINGHAM The old saying that \u201cthe first yard is in the head\u201d was never particularly good news for The Fiver. So it made us fall out of our dentist\u2019s chair to learn Edward Paul Sheringham MBE, the man that adage was written for, has turned 54 (FIFTY-FOUR). First of all: happy birthday, Teddy! Second: can we voluntarily furlough ourselves for a lockdown period spent watching late-1990s highlight reels? In truth that\u2019s how thousands of us are spending our time anyway, isn\u2019t it? Be honest. The curious thing about Clever Teddy was that he only became mainstream from his mid-20s onwards \u2013 coincidentally from around 1992, when he celebrated his 26th (sob) birthday and joined Spurs from Forest. That happens to be The Year Football Began, obviously, so our Shezzler timed things pretty perfectly: he will forever be synonymous with those fertile early years of the Premier League when the glitz didn\u2019t seem too glitzy and the entire sport hadn\u2019t run away from itself. Good times, basically. Teddy Sheringham reminds you of good times. Just like the goals against Holland in Euro 96 or, to all bar the most vehement of ABUs, That Magical Night in 1999. Few of us need an excuse to wax nostalgic at the moment and there\u2019s a fair chance Sheringham, for anyone aged between 35 and 50, epitomises the best of that era \u2013 a bit of fun, a bit of daring, the optimism and knowingness of Cool Britannia with something intangibly raffish behind it all. The debate would rage over whether a player with his style, touch and intelligence would survive in today\u2019s top flight without a burst of speed or thighs of steel; on balance you\u2019d fear for him but, if it is true that you can\u2019t lose what you never had, he\u2019s presumably still dropping deep to carve out space for a rampaging young centre-forward on a rec near you. So perhaps, in the latest virtual pub gatherings, we should all raise a glass to Teddy and memories of \u2013 in some ways at least \u2013 a slightly more innocent era. Just don\u2019t bother sending that Zoom invite to his old foe Andy Cole, who in 2010 wrote that he would \u201crather sit down and have a cuppa with Neil Ruddock, who broke my leg in two places since 1996, than with Teddy Sheringham, who I\u2019ve pretty much detested for the last 15 years\u201d. That all came about because Sheringham failed to shake Cole\u2019s hand on his England debut. Looking back now from a socially-distanced world, perhaps he was just ahead of his time. Either way, it\u2019ll be Drambuies and tequila all round for The Fiver, albeit from a sofa rather than a pretend dental surgery, and they\u2019ll be raised to a player who let those good times roll. RECOMMENDED LISTENING The latest Football Weekly Extra podcast features Max and Barry in conversation with Philippe Auclair on Fifa, board games and Eric Cantona. Listen right here. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cThis season doesn\u2019t make sense any more. We\u2019ve stopped, no team will return as before, the matches will be behind closed doors, plus there\u2019s a risk to the health of the athletes. For me to go back to business is pure madness. If they force us to play, I\u2019d be willing to not field the team and lose the matches 3-0 out of respect for the citizens of Brescia and their loved ones who are no longer there\u201d \u2013 Brescia president Massimo Cellino says he will forfeit the bottom club\u2019s matches if the Serie A season is resumed. FIVER LETTERS \u201cRe: yesterday\u2019s Fiver. Frankly, the idea of any Conservative MP complaining about moral vacuums after applying cuts to the NHS for 10 years sticks in my throat more than a bagful of morel mushrooms\u201d \u2013 Andrew Walker. \u201cHard to believe the EPL is short of mushrooms when they\u2019re such a bunch of fun guys\u201d \u2013 David Glanz. \u201cI was bitterly disappointed by Wednesday\u2019s Fiver. It was literate, perceptive, multi-layered, and a devastating critique on the current state of the game. Try to do better\u201d \u2013 Pete Hudson. \u201cSurely, after having spent most of the season successfully testing the ability of VAR to determine outcomes, we can complete the season by going straight to VAR. Oh wait, that would take too long\u201d \u2013 John Neilsen-Gammon. \u201cI don\u2019t think George Jones should be dragging his fellow subscribers into even more gloom (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters). Remembering the silent misery of a 221-mile drive back to Ipswich following a 9-0 drubbing is best left in 1995 along with Cotton Eye Joe\u201d \u2013 Tom Connolly. \u201cRe: worst games. A year ago today I was in a Kazakhstan hospital after fracturing my femur on the icy concourse in the stadium before the Scotland game. I spent 19 nights there, mostly unable to communicate with the doctors, nurses or patients. We got pumped 3-0, but at least I didn\u2019t see the goals. Every cloud \u2026\u201d \u2013 Dougie. \u201cWhich footballer would Fiver readers least like to be stuck indoors with and why? My vote would be for perfectionism\u2019s Roy Keane, who would laser-stare you every time your phone rang, your email pinged, or you mentioned ordering in Japanese food. Then he\u2019d lecture you on what Cloughie would have said about you\u201d \u2013 Justin Kavanagh. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Julian Knight, chair of the government\u2019s DCMS committee, has called for a windfall tax on Premier League clubs who refuse to cut player wages while putting other staff on furlough. \u201cWe are facing an obscene situation,\u201d he said. Brighton manager Graham Potter is one of a number of senior staff to take a voluntary three-month pay cut amid the coronavirus crisis. Cashback! Norwich City players have agreed to donate more than \u00a3200,000 from their salaries to help people in Norfolk negatively affected by coronavirus.
