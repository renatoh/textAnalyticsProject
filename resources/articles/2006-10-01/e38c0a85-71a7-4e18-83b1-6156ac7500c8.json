One thinks of films sponsored by organisations like the Highlands and Islands Development Board, the Ealing comedies of Alexander Mackendrick, and several films made in the early 1950s by the government-funded Group 3 that was headed by the great Scottish cineaste John Grierson. Over the past 30 years or so a recognisable Scottish national cinema has grown up with two main streams. Flowing from Bill Douglas's autobiographical trilogy, one is realistic, and at times miserabilist and poetic. The other was initiated by the cheerfully optimistic comedies of Bill Forsyth, the Capra of the Clyde. Writer-director Andrea Arnold's first feature-length film, Red Road, belongs firmly in the Douglas tradition, and its tone very much recalls the Scotland of Lynne Ramsay's Ratcatcher and Morvern Callar. The film's setting, characters and casting arise from a curious collaboration between Danish and British producers by which three first-time directors make films that conform to rules drawn up by two Danes. This is what we now recognise as a rather Danish way of going about things, and is less original an idea than the creators suppose. They would have known of course that Arnold, best known until now for saying on Oscar Night that receiving an Academy Award for her short film Wasp was 'the dog's bollocks', was unlikely to make a genteel comedy set in Kelvinside. Anyway, she received the Prix du Jury at Cannes for Red Road, and the restrictions imposed on her are not obviously apparent. Her carefully patterned work is in a tradition of paranoid pictures about surveillance and voyeurism that began with Fritz Lang's Dr Mabuse in the early 1920s, and it touches current feelings about alienation, intrusions into private life and breakdown of community. The film's heroine, Jackie (Kate Dickie), is a good-looking, withdrawn woman in her mid-thirties. She works as a uniformed security guard in Glasgow, her job to sit in the dark operating a bank of CCTV cameras that cover a variety of places, among them a rundown, garbage-strewn, graffiti-covered council estate of high-rise flats. She's either a widow or separated (she lives alone but still wears a ring) and has a married lover with whom she has loveless sex in his white van in the bleak countryside. She sees nothing of her family, and at her sister-in-law's wedding she has an enigmatic conversation with a middle-aged man who's clearly a relation from whom she's estranged. We're invited to speculate that he may have abused her. When it comes to information about the past, Arnold feeds it to us grudgingly, teasingly, on something less than a need-to-know basis, and some things become clear only at the very end. This adds to the suspense, but some people will find it irritating, the way some people found Michael Haneke's Hidden deliberately obscure. Watching the CCTV screens is the emotionally numb heroine's life. They give her a role as a concerned public helper (she is in contact with the police and other services), provide her with a detached sense of participation in society and satisfy a voyeuristic need. Inevitably she brings to mind the temporarily crippled cameraman played by James Stewart, observing his courtyard neighbours from a wheelchair in Hitchcock's Rear Window, and like him she becomes obsessed with a particular person she recognises and believes to be a criminal. She finds an old newspaper cutting about a man jailed for 10 years after a driving accident involving manslaughter. We're not immediately told any more about this stranger, but moviegoers familiar with Sean Penn's The Crossing Guard might guess the plot. He's a ginger-haired, casually dressed man in his thirties called Clyde Henderson (Tony Curran) who goes about in a van advertising a 24-hour-a-day service as a locksmith (a profession involving keys and secrets), and Jackie follows him around town from camera to camera. She then turns to that popular Scottish sport of stalking. Unlike the Duke of Edinburgh, who in The Queen takes William and Harry stalking stags in the Highlands as a way of forgetting their mother's death, Jackie is a modern stalker, pursuing her prey through the mean streets of Glasgow. It's an ugly, garish city full of foul-mouthed, drunken people. That early sympathy that Jackie had for the folk she's observing is pushed aside by her obsessive pursuit of what seems like revenge. At one point, while watching Henderson on CCTV, she fails to get a close-up from another screen that would have established the identities of two girls who stab a fellow teenager. Through her eyes we draw the worst inferences possible about Henderson and those around him. Is he a criminal, a paedophile, a Fagin? Or is he a well-meaning man attempting to go straight and helping others do the same? What is his relationship to a young girl he approaches as she leaves school? What sort of game is he playing with a young man (Martin Compston, hero of Ken Loach's Sweet Sixteen) who shares his flat on Red Road? Jackie doesn't confide in anyone about what she knows, suspects and intends to do, so the director doesn't tell us. After Jackie has insinuated herself into Henderson's milieu and visits his sordid apartment, the movie get darker and more complex, and the audience is invited to become increasingly fearful for her safety. It would be unfair to reveal any more, except to say that there is a sex scene of erotic danger, creepily shot with most of the light coming from a red lava lamp that seems to be having orgasms. It's very much in the manner of those late-Eighties Aids-angst films like Sea of Love and Fatal Attraction where sex is portrayed as a deadly transaction, but the resolution in no way resembles that in Rear Window Not entirely convincingly, the movie eventually moves into light, and a mood of healing, forgiveness and human understanding prevails. Red Road is one of those films that demands and rewards close attention. The performances are wholly convincing and the unremittingly pessimistic view of life in Britain's neglected inner-city areas is bracingly honest. There are flaws - most significantly when a certain glibness attends the scales falling from Jackie's eyes - but this is an extraordinarily mature and thoughtful film."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
