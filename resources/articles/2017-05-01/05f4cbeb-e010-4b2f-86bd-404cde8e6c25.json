Some viewers were not amused last September when the BBC1 and ITV rivals clashed on Sunday nights, with even Eleanor Tomlinson, who plays Poldark\u2019s wife Demelza, saying afterwards that it was \u201ca real shame\u201d as it \u201csplit the audience\u201d. However, the BBC\u2019s director of content, Charlotte Moore, told audiences at a screening of the third series of the classic Cornish drama that the latest instalment will instead be shown in the summer. Aidan Turner, who plays the brooding 18th-century Cornishman Ross Poldark, welcomed the move while Tomlinson said the show did not need to compare itself to rivals, such as Victoria. She said: \u201cI think Poldark has its own fans now, I don\u2019t think we need to compare ourselves to other period shows. I think its storylines are great and people have a love for the characters and I think that is why people will come back to Poldark.\u201d The BBC did not mention Victoria \u2013 which coincidentally is made by Mammoth Screen, the same production company as Poldark \u2013 saying only that the reason for the change was due to an earlier filming schedule, which meant \u201cwe can bring the much-anticipated third series back sooner for fans to Sunday nights in June\u201d. A second series of Victoria is expected to air in the autumn. The new series will introduce a cast of younger characters and love interests. The Northern Soul actor and Burberry model Josh Whitehouse joins as dashing aristocrat Hugh Armitage while fellow rising stars Tom York and Harry Richardson play Demelza\u2019s brothers, Drake and God-fearing Sam. Ellise Chappell joins as governess Morwenna, the Juliet to Drake\u2019s Romeo. York said: \u201cObviously, it\u2019s daunting to join such a huge show with such well-known actors; you worry, you don\u2019t want to mess up. Everyone welcomed us with open arms \u2026 we\u2019re so grateful for that. It\u2019s made our job much easier.\u201d The show\u2019s executive producer, Karen Thrussell, said the \u201cbiggest challenge this series was finding a new cast and hoping that they were all going to fit in \u2026 the new cast are amazing, they did fit in, they even bear a resemblance to each other. It might not have worked and I think it did\u201d. The appearance of Poldark\u2019s cast has often hit the headlines, particularly after pictures of Turner scything topless were released by the BBC. Turner quipped that this series he only does \u201ctopless sleeping\u201d, but after York and Richardson revealed that \u201cmore than one of us gets our tops off\u201d the pair joked they were \u201cso ready\u201d for the attention that would bring. The new series also features questions over the paternity of Poldark\u2019s former fiancee Elizabeth\u2019s child, following a controversial scene from series two in which it appeared that Poldark raped her. Religion and superstition loom large, as does Cornwall\u2019s sweeping scenery. However, as Debbie Horsfield, who adapted the novels for the BBC pointed out, there are also \u201cplenty of moments of humour\u201d. Due to the demand for Poldark, the BBC has slowed down the rate of covering the 12 books Graham wrote about the eponymous hero. Horsfield said that as Graham\u2019s fifth and sixth books \u201cget fatter \u2026 we just felt it would be better to take a bit more time to cover\u201d, so the third series covers only The Black Moon and three-quarters of Four Swans."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
