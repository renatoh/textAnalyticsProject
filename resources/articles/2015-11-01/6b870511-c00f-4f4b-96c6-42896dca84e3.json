Last week an industry moving at an ever higher speed almost crashed. On Wednesday, it was announced that Alber Elbaz would be leaving French house Lanvin, after 14 years as creative director. This followed the news last week that Raf Simons, the respected Belgian designer, would exit Christian Dior after three and a half years, his contract not renewed. They were two high-profile departures that appeared to confirm a widely held belief: the increasingly hectic search for markets and sales is taking a heavy toll on those who must come up with the ideas to feed the beast. Elbaz, it has emerged, was let go by Lanvin and its majority shareholder, Shaw-Lan Wang. The designer, in a statement, thanked his staff and clients and added: \u201cI wish the house of Lanvin the future it deserves among the best French luxury brands, and hope that it finds the business vision it needs to engage in the right way forward.\u201d What this future may hold is unclear but parting ways with Elbaz suggests the house, founded by Jeanne Lanvin in 1889 and revived by Elbaz\u2019s appointment in 2001, is responding to slowing growth and searching for another direction. It is thought that additional investment is necessary and Wang\u2019s hard bargaining to get the right amount of cash injection had caused a rift between her and Elbaz, a designer who was much adored for his feminine but wearable clothes, as well as his own trademark look of bow tie and glasses. The protests by those in the Lanvin atelier after his dismissal showed how well-liked he is. Simons, meanwhile, is thought to have left Dior in an attempt to preserve a work-life balance \u2013 and focus on his own label. In his statement, released last week, he said his decision was \u201cbased entirely and equally on my desire to focus on other interests in my life, including my own brand, and the passions that drive me outside my work\u201d. Some argue that, for Simons, the Dior gig was a means to an end \u2013 providing enough money for his eponymous label, with its street-based aesthetic, to move to the next level. Is fashion\u2019s current business model \u2013 where designers are expected to create at least six collections a year \u2013 sustainable? After Simons\u2019 departure, esteemed fashion journalist Suzy Menkes wrote an article on Vogue\u2019s website entitled \u201cWhy fashion is crashing\u201d, bemoaning a world where a designer is expected to make six collections a year, as well as satisfy press commitments, a social media profile and personal appearances at client events around the world. Namechecking the morality tales of John Galliano and Marc Jacobs\u2019 substance abuse issues, she wrote \u201cdesigners \u2013 by their nature sensitive, emotional and artistic people \u2013 are being asked to take on so much. Too much.\u201d She went on to praise Simons for \u201chis brave stand\u201d. The Elbaz news brought further impassioned pleas from the industry. Sarah Mower, Vogue\u2019s chief critic and the British Fashion Council\u2019s ambassador for emerging talent, used her article on Elbaz to ask \u201cexactly what place of strife has today\u2019s fashion industry become?\u201d Speaking to the Observer, she suggested there was a disconnect at the heart of fashion between creativity and commerce. \u201cWe only ever get to talk to designers, we never get the commercial perspective,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be nice to hear from their side. They are under enormous pressure because of the luxury market in China. When that growth starts to plateau, that\u2019s when there are problems.\u201d Mower says the almost endless production of new designs by creatives is \u201cworse than churning [them out].\u201d Richard Nicoll, a successful London fashion week designer, put his business on hold last year when the breakneck speed of fashion took its toll. \u201cIt was not rewarding,\u201d he said. \u201cI was doing six [collections a year] and not enjoying it. It\u2019s hard to keep doing them with integrity and authority when they\u2019re so frequent. I fell out of love with it by the end.\u201d Nicoll has since worked for high street brand Jack Wills, and is enjoying freelancing. He has plans to relaunch his own label at some point but \u201cin a very different way\u201d. Perhaps designers might take note of Azzedine Ala\u00efa\u2019s approach. The much-respected Tunisian-born, Paris-based designer refuses to show his clothes as part of fashion weeks\u2019 seasons, and instead has presentations whenever he feels ready to show a collection. Some in the industry believe the current debate puts the focus on the wrong area. Daniel Marks, director of PR agency The Communications Store, who represents London designers including Christopher Kane and Erdem, agrees there is pressure \u201cprobably more than there ever has been, but that isn\u2019t the reason something doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s because a designer is not ably supported\u201d. He argues that the secret is an alliance between the commercial and creative. \u201cI have no idea what happened at Dior and Lanvin but the key to a successful brand is the balance between creativity and commerce and a team who work together towards the same goals with mutual respect,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you get the right CEO, that\u2019s when success happens.\u201d Marks points to Kering \u2013 the fashion conglomerate that owns Gucci, Alexander McQueen, Stella McCartney and Christopher Kane \u2013 as a company where this culture is in place. \u201cThey look after their brands really well,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s Jonathan Ackroyd at McQueen, Sarah Crook at Christopher Kane.\u201d Marks believes more business minds need to be attracted to fashion. \u201cFashion is a serious business and an extraordinary one,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are all in the business of magic and dreams. Why would you not want to work in the fashion industry?\u201d As for the creative talents, the exits of Elbaz and Simons leave two positions vacant at major Parisian houses. It seems probable that Elbaz may take over at Dior. Mower hopes, however, that he takes his time. \u201cAlber would be very good at Dior \u2013 he loves women, he\u2019s a great colourist and he would bring some humour,\u201d Mower says. \u201cBut my fantasy scenario is that he will take a year out and then start his own business.\u201d Whatever he decides to do will ripple across the industry, and have repercussions far beyond his own career."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
