Or sing, in the case of Paul McCartney. Yet despite having dozens of people whose job it is to tell them exactly what to think and say abroad, many politicians and celebs seem unable to stay on message. A failure of ego or intelligence. Or both. The world might feel a great deal safer without this year's Republican presidential hopeful, Mitt Romney, but it would also be more boring. In July, Romney headed off to Europe \u2013 wherever that was \u2013 in a bid to raise his profile as an international statesman, and managed to insult just about everyone he met. He started in London by suggesting that Britain's preparations for the Olympic games were inadequate and \"disconcerting\", before flying to Israel, where he managed to ignore the economic impact of the occupation of the West Bank by arguing it was culture that made Israelis wealthier than the Palestinians. To make matters worse, he insisted on calling Jerusalem the \"capital\" of Israel \u2013 thereby doing even more to undermine the Middle East peace process than Tony Blair. If that weren't enough, Romney then went north to Poland, unaware that his anti-trades union rhetoric might not go down all that well with Solidarity, the union that ended Communist rule in 1989. Even Boris Johnson has never managed so many gaffes in one trip, though Romney's crowning glory did come at home when he announced his vice-presidential running mate, Paul Ryan, as the \"next president of the United States\". The actual next president of the US didn't manage to get through the year unscathed, either. On a visit to Burma, President Obama referred to the country as Myanmar, the name given to it by the military junta in 1989 after crushing the pro-democracy movement. This may have been an attempt to recognise the Burmese government's grudging steps towards a more liberal state, but to many of the Burmese people \u2013 not least Aung San Suu Kyi \u2013 it looked suspiciously like an endorsement of the regime. With William Hague strangely quiet, presumably having been sent to remedial classes after sighting Colonel Gadafi in Venezuela last year, it was left to David Cameron to fly the flag for British political incompetence abroad. Cameron's coup de th\u00e9\u00e2tre came with an appearance on the David Letterman show in which he failed to answer questions on British history. Not knowing who composed Rule Britannia was perhaps forgivable, but not being able to have even a stab at guessing the meaning of Magna Carta was beyond stupid for someone with a classical education. Still, as most of Letterman's audience probably had no idea who Cameron was, he didn't have too much credibility to damage. But the year's clear winner for insulting an entire nation has to go to the British organisers of the Olympics for raising the South Korean flag at a match involving the North Korean women. That's the kind of gaffe that can start a world war.
