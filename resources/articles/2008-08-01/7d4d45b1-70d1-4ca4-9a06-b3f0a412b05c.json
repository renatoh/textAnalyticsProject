I can hear Manny Farber growling that it is - if you get on with it. So Manny, who has died aged 91, was tall, lanky and comic looking. He might have played Popeye, or one of those old-timers in the Anthony Mann westerns he cherished. He wore jeans and plaid shirts and the hair had gone back from his great dome of a forehead by the time I met him. But I believed in him straightaway, as someone who had seen the west on screen and on canvas and knew it was so beautiful that a man had to keep pretty tight-lipped about it if he wasn't going to get emotional. In fact, Manny was an emotional man, who believed enough in the western and its imagery to stay as blunt as Gary Cooper. Then a grin spread over his battered walnut face and he was sharing the joke with you: God, is it all beautiful, or what? But don't say so, or we'll be crowded out with tourists. So it is proper to point out that he was born in Douglas, Arizona, which is and will always be (unless the wind blows it away) a small place on the Mexican border. This is an unexpected launch-site for the essential, gruff-lyrical voice in American film criticism. But then you have to realise that the house where his Russian-Jewish parents had a dry-goods store also produced two brothers who would become psychoanalysts. I went there once, and, when I told Manny, he said: \"Quite a dump, isn't it?\" It must have been a hard place to live - it was not far from Tombstone where the Earps had ruled and close to the spot where Pancho Villa briefly invaded New Mexico in 1916. This is the landscape of The Searchers and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, of real-life cowboys and Indians as well as the semi-desert landscapes of Budd Boetticher and Sam Peckinpah. There was a spectacular tradition of scenic painting in America in the 19th century, but Manny was unmoved by it. He had an eye for desert terrain, for tracks, the range from sand to ochre and the ease with which one might get lost. The family moved to Vallejo, California, when he was 15 and he went on, briefly, to the University of California at Berkeley and then to Stanford University in Palo Alto, where he studied art for a year. But it was at what became the San Francisco Art Institute that he reckoned he would be a painter. However, when he moved east to pursue that, he encountered the large question of survival. He was a carpenter, on and off, in Washington DC and in New York. But he also got into film criticism. In 1942, he succeeded Otis Ferguson - killed in the war - at the New Republic. A few years later, he followed James Agee at the Nation. More or less, he wrote for those journals into the 1950s. He reviewed films and new paintings and occasionally took on more general essays. He never raved. He was sometimes merciless in a put-down, and it is not that his taste was unerring - taste can't be: it is meant to be personal. You couldn't always tell if he liked a film or not. But Manny was the first person in English who wrestled with words to arouse the feelings produced by imagery on screen. People said, well, of course, he is a painter working out movies. That was true - but Manny was also like an actor up on the screen, keeping pace with the action. He did not much like artistic films that wanted to be respectable. He loved genre movies: the western, the thriller, the noirs that graced his days, and the comedies of Preston Sturges. And he had no intention of being easy or congratulatory to the viewer. He was seldom a beguiling writer or a career power-broker, but he laid down an approach that has been hugely influential and which endorses the virtues of \"entertainment\" cinema. You may never have read Manny, so you deserve a substantial, chewable extract. Here he is, in 1951, rather eschewing Alfred Hitchcock in talking about Strangers on a Train and going to the odd heart of that perverse film: \"The movie is built round the travestied homosexuality of the murderer. Robert Walker provides the role with a meatier, more introverted, unhealthier savor than the stars usually give a Hollywood production. This is partly the result of Hitchcock's mechanical and spurious use of the new close-up style of camera work, which is evidently aimed at fetishists who like to study pores. Here he has given Walker an oily, puffy face and made him skitter his eyes back and forth horizontally until it appears that the actor looks at everybody as if he were reading a book.\" No one had talked like that about film before. But then, just as his kind of analysis began to be picked up, and Farber might have run one of the new film departments at a big university, he began to slide away from film criticism and into painting. There were valuable, longer essays in specialist magazines, many of which were collected in Negative Space (1971). By then he was teaching at the University of California at San Diego, with his wife Patricia Patterson (also a painter and writer) and with a son-like supporter, Jean-Pierre Gorin. He taught there until 1987 and by then he was seeing fewer films and devoting more time to paintings - map-like panoramas of the west and the western in which desert light mixes with movie light. As a painter he had retrospective exhibitions. As for the writer, his followers await the publication (from Harvard University Press) of his complete writings. At his death, the emeritus professor of art was a fabulous old-timer who must have been a beautiful, dangerous-looking kid when Arizona was the wild west. He is survived by Patricia, a daughter from a previous marriage and a grandson. \u00b7 Manny (Emanuel) Farber, film critic and artist, born February 20 1917; died August 18 2008"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
