The National Audit Office said that Home Office officials admit that they have no specific evidence to show the \u201ccompliant environment\u201d policy \u2013 the successor to the \u201chostile environment\u201d that led to the Windrush scandal \u2013 encourages voluntary departures or fosters compliance with visa and passport conditions. In a report issued on Wednesday, auditors also pointed out that the Home Office has not updated its estimate of the size of the illegal population for 15 years, and that nearly two-thirds of immigration enforcement detainees are released from detention without removal. It comes days after the equalities watchdog, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, announced it would launch legal action to review whether the department had complied with equality law when implementing the \u201chostile environment\u201d. Responding to the report, Meg Hillier MP, chair of the public accounts committee, said the department seems to have little information on which to base its policies. She said: \u201cThe Home Office has no idea how many people are in the country illegally and doesn\u2019t seem interested in finding out. \u201cIt can\u2019t demonstrate that its actions to control illegal immigration are working as intended, and doesn\u2019t understand how different aspects of its work fit together.\u201d The report into the Home Office\u2019s immigration enforcement directorate examined its compliant environment policy, which limits access to work, housing, benefits and other government-funded services. But auditors said there was no evidence that it encouraged compliance among those staying in the UK without documentation. \u201cThe department acknowledges that it had no specific evidence base to support the effectiveness of these measures when they were introduced. It is currently unable to measure whether these activities have the desired effect of encouraging people to leave voluntarily,\u201d the report said. The last estimate of the size of the illegal population in the UK was made in 2005 and suggested there were about 430,000 people in the country with no right to remain here, auditors said. The department has instead estimated that demand for immigration enforcement activity is between 240,000 and 320,000 cases per year, added the report. Nearly two-thirds of immigration enforcement detainees are released from detention without removal, the report found, with greater numbers of detainees being released at a late stage because officials could not deport them. \u201cWe have not seen evidence it has tried to actively understand and manage these challenges and it has no strategy across the work of Immigration Enforcement and the rest of the Department to reduce their frequency. \u201cIn the 12 months to the end of December 2019 it released 14,900 (62%) of the detainees whom it intended to remove from the country,\u201d the report said. The \u201chostile environment\u201d label was dropped two years ago after the Windrush scandal revealed that thousands of people who came to the UK from the Commonwealth were denied access to public services and jobs \u2013 with some dying abroad after being deported. The then home secretary Sajid Javid disowned the term in favour of \u201ccompliant environment\u201d, and vowed to prioritise the Windrush scandal. But many campaigners and politicians have claimed that the new policy is a continuation of the same core principles."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
