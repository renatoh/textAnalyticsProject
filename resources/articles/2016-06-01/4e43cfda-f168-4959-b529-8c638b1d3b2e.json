The 53-year-old has been the No1 choice of Goodison Park\u2019s major shareholder Farhad Moshiri since Roberto Mart\u00ednez was sacked last month. Koeman would become one of the highest-paid managers in the Premier League on a \u00a36m-a-year deal and has been promised substantial transfer funds by Moshiri. The former Barcelona defender had a season remaining on his three-year contract but it now looks only a matter of time before he becomes Everton\u2019s new manager. Rob Jansen, who recently replaced Guido Albers as Koeman\u2019s agent, told Voetbal International on Saturday that they had \u201creached an agreement with Everton\u201d and \u201cnow it is up to the clubs\u201d. Everton have spoken with representatives of the Sevilla manager, Unai Emery, while Frank de Boer, Manuel Pellegrini and David Moyes were also under consideration. However, Koeman became the clear frontrunner and, after guiding Southampton to their best Premier League finish in successive seasons, he now looks set to begin a fresh chapter on Merseyside. One of his first jobs will be to persuade John Stones and Romelu Lukaku to stay on at Everton. The England defender has been targeted by Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City while the Belgium striker, who has been in fine form for his country in the Euro 2016 warm-up matches, said last month that he wanted to \u201cplay in the Champions League from next season\u201d. United\u2019s new manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is understood to retain an interest in Stones, who is valued at more than \u00a340m, but Everton hope that the new investment and a fresh direction under Koeman will satisfy their high-profile players."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
