The Intel Developers Forum should be like this, but it isn't, as you could tell from today's schedule. 6.30am Alarm call; shave; shower etc. 7.15am Breakfast in press room. Check email. 7.45 Head for convention centre. 8.00-9.30am Keynote presentation by Intel's Sean Maloney and Mark Fister (yes, they turn off the wireless LAN). 9.40-10.00am Q&amp;A with Sean Maloney and Mark Fister. 10.15am Back to hotel, to press room: check email, say hello to Sean Maloney. 10.40-11.00 Roundtable briefing with Sean Maloney. 11.00-12.10 Storage press lunch and technology showcase with Sean Maloney. 12.10 Check email, go outside, lie down, no, do a bit of blogging.... I always enjoy meeting Sean Maloney, which is just as well, since I've been meeting him for 12-15 years -- he featured in Computer Guardian when Intel launched it i960 RISC processor. Then he was a very bright lad from Lewisham. Now he's a very bright lad from Lewisham who has climbed the Intel hierarchy to executive vice president level, and is general manager of Intel's communications business. Since it's now 12.25pm in San Jose, Ca, I just have time to grab a sandwich before my 1.00pm session on Intel and \"green\" design. A conference planner with a sense of humour has scheduled this for the Garden Room."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
