Paul Nicholls's ace put up an impressive performance in his last race before he attempts back-to-back victories in the Prestbury Park showpiece. Jumping into the lead three out, Kauto Star (4-11) turned on the power for Ruby Walsh to beat Monet's Garden by a comfortable eight lengths with Racing Demon a further neck adrift in third. Fair Along set a strong gallop from the outset with Walsh content to settle the hot favourite in joint third place with Racing Demon. However, the pacemaker came back to the field by the fourth last at which point Walsh made his move on Kauto Star. Once he hit the front, the rest of the field were always fighting a losing battle as Kauto Star turned on the style, jumping impressively and hacking up for a clear win. \"I wanted him ridden positively,\" said Nicholls. \"There's no point dropping him out the door and riding him negative. Ride him positive - he stays and jumps better. I said to Ruby this morning that I wanted him third or fourth and just track through. That's the way to ride him and he jumped great. \"I think he's as well as he's ever been. He looks great we've left plenty to work on again but he was probably a lot fitter than Denman was as he's that type of horse. We just have a month now to keep him spot on.I'm lucky that I've got a great team at home. We've worked hard to train both horses. They will be trained to turn up at Cheltenham on Gold Cup day at their very best. \"I've got a certain amount of loyalty to Kauto Star as he is the reigning champion. You can see from today's performance he'll be very hard to beat.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
