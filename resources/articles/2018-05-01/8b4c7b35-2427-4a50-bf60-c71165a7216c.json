It looks a bit like the start of The Apprentice but it\u2019s King Lear. \u201cNothing will come of nothing\u201d \u2026 you\u2019re fired. Just along the river, Gloucester and Kent (Jims Broadbent and Carter) arrive at the Tower in a black Range Rover. The king presumably will land at City airport in a Learjet. He doesn\u2019t. They missed a trick there. Anyway, he\u2019s already here at the Tower. In Richard Eyre\u2019s TV adaptation, Lear (Anthony Hopkins) is a military dictator in the present, gathering the troops \u2013 and the family \u2013 for the division of the kingdom. The north, and its powerhouse presumably, goes to Goneril (Emma Thompson). The West Country to Regan (Emily Watson, this is a seriously sparkly cast). The prosperous south-east is due to be Cordelia\u2019s, until she fails in her filial flattery and is disinherited, disowned and sent to France (boo) instead. It\u2019s really not such a leap of the imagination \u2013 the ageing, dangerous, male autocrat losing the plot. Or the power-passing down a generation. I thought of the Kims over in Pyongyang, another dynasty that also has favourite offspring, illegitimate offspring, a Midsomer body count and sibling poisoning. And the Murdochs. Anyway, the point is, Eyre\u2019s TV Lear doesn\u2019t just sparkle and shine with city lights and thespy stars, it hammers on the big bell of relevance as well. (The Bard should probably take some of the credit, too.) Shakespeare on television \u2013 a box it wasn\u2019t designed for and doesn\u2019t necessarily fit \u2013 isn\u2019t always successful. It only works if it\u2019s not just a play on the telly, but something in its own right, too, with its own identity. This one achieves that, with pace and modernity. No Learjets maybe, but there are helicopters, and other 21st-century weaponry, in the war between England and France. Kent\u2019s disguise is a skinhead cut. Edmund and Edgar\u2019s duel, an epic bout, is fought in the medium of \u2026 mixed martial arts. The heath has a busy A-road passing through it, along which to wander along \u2013 the A2 perhaps, on its way to Dover. It also encompasses a dreary city centre, the no-longer-new-town of Stevenage. That\u2019s a memorable scene: Gloucester, now sightless, and Edgar, sitting on a bench in a concrete precinct, bumped into by Lear, in the full throes of madness, pushing his overflowing supermarket trolley around. That\u2019s exactly where they\u2019d be today, Stevenage. It\u2019s not surprising to hear that a passerby mistook Hopkins for a homeless person and directed him to a hostel. I\u2019m not Michael Billington (just to be clear): I cannot compare Hopkins\u2019s performance with other great Lears I have known, to be honest I haven\u2019t known that many. I can say it is that, though \u2013 a great one. Now 80 himself, the right age, Hopkins is at home in Lear\u2019s skin. Shouty, angry, cruel one moment; vulnerable, tender, loving the next \u2013 or at the same time. A mesmerising performance. Thompson\u2019s power-hungry and cold Goneril reminded me of another Hopkins \u2013 Katie, who was in The Apprentice. There are fabulous performances all over the place; I enjoyed Karl Johnson\u2019s Fool and Christopher Eccleston\u2019s oily Oswald. Plus, TV provides an intimacy you don\u2019t get at the National Theatre. A bit too intimate, perhaps, in Gloucester\u2019s eye-gouging. I\u2019ve never been good with eye-gouging. In, stay in, \u201cvile jelly!\u201d I also enjoyed not sitting behind a Bard-bore, chortling loudly because he wants everyone to know that he knows that something is humour. Not too many gags in Lear, to be fair. Not only am I not Michael Billington, as I think I mentioned, I\u2019m not even a Shakespearean scholar, you may be surprised to hear. I did do King Lear at school, a very long time ago. And that\u2019s enough: I\u2019m in, focused, not wandering (well, not too much). The MMA and the helicopters and the fact that it\u2019s only two hours long all help, but if this Fool can get involved and engage, then anyone can. You don\u2019t even have to be an expert in 21st-century geopolitics (which I am). Have you got \u2013 or have you ever had, or are you perhaps \u2013 a father? Do you have a family? Of human beings? That\u2019s all you need, and it\u2019s better than The Apprentice. The wheel has come full circle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
