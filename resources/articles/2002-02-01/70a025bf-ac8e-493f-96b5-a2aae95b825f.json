The cash-strapped German group wants to merge KirchMedia with its ProSiebenSat.1 TV company in June and take a stock market listing. And a Kirch spokesman said the move would go ahead, despite reports today that bankers working on the merger believed it could be pulled at \"any time\". \"The preparations are on track and ongoing and there is no doubt we will merge,\" he said. However, he refused to comment on reports the merger might be delayed for a few weeks as Kirch bids to convince potential shareholders the new company is a reliable investment. Some analysts are incredulous that KirchMedia can be floated off while its parent company juggles with a debt pile estimated at somewhere between \u00a35bn and \u00a38bn. It is estimated that KirchMedia's pay-TV arm, Premiere, is losing around \u00a3900,000 a day. A mass of market rumour-mongering is swirling around Kirch, which is a private company and therefore does not have to supply a steady stream of financial information to the stock markets. As a result, its debt burden is a subject of informed guesswork rather than detailed examination of the company's accounts. A Kirch insider said a story in the Wall Street Journal putting Kirch's debt at \u00a38bn did not come from a \"serious source\". Bondholders in ProSieben, which owns the Kabel 1 and N24 free-to-air channels, are concerned Kirch will offload much of its debt on to the newly formed company. One group has demanded a refund on \u00a3245m worth of bonds if the merger is not called off, which could trigger a default by the entire Kirch group if ProSieben cannot afford to pay up. Kirch owns 52% of ProSieben and, under the terms of its loans, a default by one of its subsidiaries could constitute a default by the entire Kirch group on its multibillion-pound debt burden. German media executives and politicians are concerned this house-of-cards scenario could allow the likes of Rupert Murdoch and John Malone to take control of Kirch assets. But the Kirch spokesman said the newly formed group would be a dynamic broadcasting business, including KirchMedia's DSF free-to-air channel, the rights to formula one racing and the next two football World Cups. \"We will have a fully integrated media group, which means we will have the production and TV rights arms on one side and, on the other, we will have distribution channels through our TV stations,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
