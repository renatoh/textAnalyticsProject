His family issued a statement to say that \"lengthy surgery\" had taken place on Friday and that no further updates would be issued until Tuesday. McNamara, a popular and long-standing member of the Irish racing scene, was riding in the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Handicap Chase at the end of Thursday's card when his mount, Galaxy Rock, was a faller at the first fence. Officials at the track reported that he was conscious in the immediate aftermath of the fall but was put into an induced coma before being airlifted to Frenchay, where it was discovered that he had fractured his C3 and C4 vertebrae. The jockey's wife, Caroline, travelled from their Limerick home and has been at Frenchay since Friday. She is being assisted by Dr Adrian McGoldrick of the Irish Turf Club and Lisa Hancock, the chief executive of the Injured Jockeys Fund. McNamara, 37, has enjoyed a long and successful career in the saddle, winning a Grade One on Like-A-Butterfly as long ago as 2001. His four Festival wins include Teaforthree in last year's National Hunt Chase."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
