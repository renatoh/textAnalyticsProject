The Office for National Statistics said the \u00a320.8bn deficit \u2013 which includes the UK's trade balance, as well as the shortfall on overseas investments by UK plc \u2013 was the biggest ever for a quarter. And after the market closed, ratings agency Fitch warned Britain had moved a step closer to losing its cherished AAA credit rating. The agency, which already had the UK on \"negative watch\" maintained the AAA rating but warned rising debts and slowing growth jeopardised its status as a safe haven for investors. But on the corporate front the prospect of mergers and acquisitions made a welcome return to the stock market this week. Admittedly, little activity went beyond the talking stage, but investors will take heart at any chance of movement. The news over the past week can be split into two categories \u2013 confirmed talks that may or may not lead to anything substantial, and the most meagre of rumours that are getting punters excited. In the first category is the continuing saga of global commodity trader Glencore and mining group Xstrata. The miner has until 7am on Monday to decide if it wants to accept an improved $32bn (\u00a319.8bn) offer from Glencore. Early indications suggest that the deadline will be extended again. The other mega-merger between British arms manufacturer BAE Systems and Airbus parent EADS was the subject of intense political wrangling as both companies attempt to convince German, French, US and British politicians that the deal is in their interests. Again, a deadline extension is the most likely outcome. The makers of Scotland's favourite fizzy drink, Irn-Bru, AG Barr, continues its talks with rival Britvic for a \u00a31.6bn merger. It has until Tuesday morning to make a decision. Sticking with drinks, the spirits group Diageo confirmed it was in discussions with India's United Spirits. The deal could see the Guinness maker become one of the biggest drinks operators in India. However, both firms are cautious after a similar takeover attempt failed in 2009. The unsubstantiated rumour also had its place, with supermarket J Sainsbury plc said to be in the sights of 26% shareholder and failed bidder the Qatar Investment Authority (also Xstrata's second biggest shareholder). Construction supply group Weir could attract the attentions of GE, following the US group's move to set up a mining subsidiary, while National Grid is supposedly being eyed up by Chinese and American predators. Even Bumi \u2013 Nat Rothschild's mining baby, which announced an investigation into \"financial irregularities\" on Monday \u2013 could be vulnerable, with a handful of hedge funds said to be looking over the numbers. Finally, Standard Chartered may face a takeover challenge if rumours that Singapore's Temasek sells its 18% stake in the Asia-focused bank. Simon Willis at Daniel Stewart speculated: \"Who are the most likely buyers? A Chinese bank or the sovereign wealth fund; or a middle eastern sovereign wealth fund. We believe the former is the more likely, which may reignite bid speculation, though Standard Chartered clearly has no need to sell out, and certainly not on the cheap.\" The hope must be that all the talk can turn to deals or the City's M&amp;A bankers will be forced to twiddle their thumbs a little longer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
