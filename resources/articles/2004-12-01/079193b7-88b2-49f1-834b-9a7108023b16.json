Barton also issued a formal apology after admitting stubbing a lit cigar into the eye of the reserve-team player Jamie Tandy. City had seriously considered making Barton available for transfer but decided instead to fine him six weeks' wages, approximately \u00a390,000, two of which will be suspended for a year. An internal disciplinary hearing had found him guilty of a charge of gross misconduct, giving City the power to exceed the maximum two-week fine usually stipulated by the Professional Footballers' Association. Tandy, who has resumed training after two visits to hospital this week, was fined a fortnight's wages, suspended for a year, after admitting that he had tried to set fire to Barton's shirt with a cigarette lighter. Tandy's fine - around \u00a32,500 - will be waived if he stays out of trouble for another 12 months but neither player is getting any support from the club's hierarchy. \"The events of Sunday evening seriously fell below the high standards we expect and demand at this club,\" said the City chairman John Wardle. \"Our players know the rewards their job brings them but they also must realise the responsibilities they have to this club and our supporters.\" City took into account the fact that Barton had shown contrition but made it clear he would be sold if he continued to bring the club and himself into disrepute. Barton, who is expected to retain his place in the team for the Boxing Day game at Everton, issued a carefully worded statement through the club but there were no words of remorse offered to Tandy. \"I would like to apologise for my part in the incident which took place on Sunday evening,\" he said. \"I feel embarrassed about what I did and deeply regret it.\" \"I am grateful for the support of the club, our supporters and my family during this time. I fully accept the punishment and have cooperated with the disciplinary procedure.\" Rotherham United, bottom of the Coca-Cola Championship, have been taken over by a supporters-led group. Millers 05 Ltd, whose board is made up of a group of prominent professional people who already have strong connections with Rotherham United Supporters' Trust - have been assisted with financing by the retiring chairman Ken Booth. \"The aim now is to try to avoid relegation and stay in the Championship. We have provided the club with a basis to move forward,\" said the group spokesman David Veal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
