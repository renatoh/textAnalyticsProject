Hull have waited since last June \u2013 13 games and 240 days \u2013 to experience the euphoria and elation of victory: but no matter what happens next for Hull, few afternoons will be quite like this. Anything other than victory here would have been tough for them to take, given the nature of how they put their bodies on the line for more than 80 gruelling minutes in a backdrop of injuries and adversity. So when Oliver Gildart crossed to level the scores with seconds remaining, you wondered how Hull \u2013 and Radford \u2013 would pick themselves up. However, Zak Hardaker\u2019s wayward conversion handed the Black and Whites a reprieve and gave us the first golden point extra-time in Super League \u2013 and how they seized the opportunity. Within seconds of play restarting, Marc Sneyd\u2019s drop goal secured that long-awaited victory. \u201cHe\u2019s the iceman,\u201d Radford said of his scrum-half. \u201cI\u2019m relieved for them, the players. We had no bench left at the end with injuries and if we\u2019d come away with nothing from here after that effort \u2026 it\u2019d have been tough.\u201d All the drama of golden point almost managed to overshadow the biggest pre-match talking point \u2013 the return of the former Great Britain and Hull captain Gareth Ellis from an 18-month retirement at the age of 37. With injuries and suspension robbing Hull of his first-choice props, Ellis answered the call with an impressive display in the pack. \u201cIt was a typical Gareth Ellis performance,\u201d Radford said. \u201cI\u2019ve lent him my full body massager after that and if he pulls up OK, we\u2019ll see about him playing next week.\u201d Hull were magnificent all afternoon, not least in establishing a half-time lead of four points after tries for Carlos Tuimavave, Joe Westerman and Ratu Naulago \u2013 the former Saracens winger who marked his rugby league debut with two tries. Wigan\u2019s response came from Gildart and Liam Byrne \u2013 but this was a below-par performance from the champions, who have one win from their first three games. \u201cThere weren\u2019t good signs throughout the match,\u201d said their coach, Adrian Lam. Naulago\u2019s second four minutes after half-time put Hull in control, though as injuries began to bite, the visitors began to tire noticeably. Wigan took advantage: first, Ben Flower charged over with 15 minutes remaining, before a period of sustained pressure yielded another Gildart try. But Hardaker could not break Hull hearts by kicking the conversion and Sneyd\u2019s drop goal sealed victory.
