And this year is no different. The kinky Cosi of last year is back, with its sado-masochistic fantasies, along with an offering that's far worse: The Marriage of Figaro set in a registry office. A bearded rock musician wanders around, playing the recitatives on electronic keyboards and occasionally blowing into beer bottles. Swiss director Christoph Marthaler has subordinated the complicated story to his registry office concept, while Anna Viebrock's set is gratuitously squalid, with doors to women's and men's loos predictably used for cheap laughs. Such infantile humour undermines Mozart and Da Ponte's brilliant comic set pieces. Happily, Peter Mattei is a superb Count Almaviva, and Christine Sch\u00e4fer a sparky Cherubino, with Marthaler's wheeze of making him/her a young punk one of his few effective ideas. Lorenzo Regazzo is a personable Figaro, and Christiane Oelze a lively Susanna, with Angela Denoke a warm if slightly tremulous Countess. Sadly, with the Salzburg Camerata in the pit, Sylvain Cambreling proves to be an uninspired Mozartian. Lothar Zagrosek, with the Vienna Philharmonic, is much more successful in the revival of Cosi Fan Tutte. The trouble with Hans Neuenfels's production remains not so much the kinky images, which can be fun, but the fact that the men, Ferrando and Guglielmo, make no pretence of putting on disguises when they seek to change partners and seduce the other chap's girl. All four lovers are corseted in identical white trouser-suits. Surtitles have been banned this year, for making it too clear how far the words depart from what you see on stage. Again, there is some excellent singing, notably from Catherine Naglestad as a warmly vulnerable Fiordiligi and Franz Hawlata as a commanding Don Alfonso. The towering operatic performance this year has come not in Mozart, but in Verdi, with Bryn Terfel outshining even his own Covent Garden achievement in the title role of Falstaff. Though updated to the Edwardian period, Declan Donnellan's production is satisfyingly conventional, with the humour deliciously brought out. Movable screens as backcloths mean that scene changes are instantaneous and silent. Lorin Maazel, always at his most winning with the Vienna Philharmonic, secures superb ensemble work, helped by an excellent supporting cast. He is even more at home in the other Verdi opera presented this year, Don Carlo. As usual in Salzburg, it is given in the four-act revision, with monumental stylised sets designed by stage director Herbert Wernicke. Maazel's powerful conducting is matched by the singing of a superb team: Ferruccio Furlanetto as Philip II, Neil Shicoff as Carlo, Thomas Hampson as Posa, Marina Mescheriakova as Elisabetta and Yvonne Naef as Eboli.
