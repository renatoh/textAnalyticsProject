Each production yields fresh insights. And, watching Ian Rickson's beautifully lucid and perceptive revival, I became aware how much the play deals with the shifting balance of power in triangular relationships, and with the pain of loss. It is acknowledged that, by using reverse chronology to chart a seven-year-long affair, Pinter probes the corrosive nature of betrayal. Emma and Jerry, the married lovers, have palpably betrayed both their partners. Robert, Emma's husband, has also betrayed Jerry, his closest friend, by not revealing to him his discovery of the affair. And since Jerry and Robert, respectively an agent and publisher, treat literature as a commodity, they can both be said to have betrayed the idealism that in their youth led them to worship poetry, that of Yeats especially, for its aesthetic joy. All this is established. What Rickson brings out is the heartache beneath the multiple infidelities. In the poignant scene where Emma and Jerry part in the Kilburn flat that has been their secret love-nest, there is a cold sadness to Kristin Scott Thomas as Emma, and a defeated solitude to Douglas Henshall as Jerry. Yet when their fingers lightly touch, you sense the weight of their emotional past and their awareness of what is sacrificed. This ability to pin down the terminal moment in a relationship is even more evident in the pivotal scene in a Venetian hotel where Robert learns of his wife's affair. It is beautifully written, in that her guilt confronts his seeming insouciance. Here it acquires extra resonance in that Ben Miles's Robert first hurls a bed-cover at Emma's head, and then, as she looks pleadingly at him, leans across to wipe her tears. Far from being sentimental, it is symbolic of the moment when their union ends and becomes a thing of social custom. Rickson's production gives Pinter's play an extra layer of emotional and physical reality: even the bridges between scenes, as Jeremy Herbert's ingenious set unfolds, are informative, so that we see Jerry clutching the crucial letter that will end up in the Venice post office. But there is also revelation in the excellent performances: the major discovery to me was Miles's Robert. Looking extraordinarily like the young Pinter with his long sideburns and accosting profile, he shows Robert as a man who conceals his emotional hurt under a sardonic mask and relishes his power over the unaware Jerry. Henshall reinforces this impression by playing Jerry as a man who proceeds through life in a state of jittery ignorance; he invests the character with the guilelessness of a man who seems oblivious, even to the fact that his own wife may be having an affair. Scott Thomas uses her wonderfully expressive features to indicate all the calibrated shifts in Emma's character, in some ways, the toughest of the three; and, in the opening scene, she registers the radiant assurance of the survivor. In a telltale gesture that pre-empts the moment of parting we see later, she slowly withdraws her hand from Jerry's tender touch. That is a measure of the infinite subtlety of a production which anchors Pinter's elegant theatrical construct in a world of emotional truth. Those who know the play well will find new meanings in this revival; and those who don't will be ushered into a world where pain and loss are explored with poetic precision."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
