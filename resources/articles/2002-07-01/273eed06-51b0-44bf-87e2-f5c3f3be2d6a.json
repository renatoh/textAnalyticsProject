In what was only his third Test, the fly-half guided the Springboks to a sizeable win by accruing 24 points, a personal haul which included a try, five conversions and three penalties. The Pumas started the game like men possessed, with the Springboks taking all of 13 minutes to gain any meaningful possession at the PAM Brink Stadium. The turning point came when South Africa turned over some dangerous possession inside the 22 for the scrum-half Craig Davidson to flip the ball out to Pretorius. He was caught a metre out and, in the flurry of activity, appeared to have grounded the ball on the tryline. The video evidence proved otherwise, however, and the referee ruled that Pretorius had played the ball forward. The fly-half was to exact revenge eight minutes later when he slotted a long-range penalty to open the scoring, and had a hand in the first try a minute later. Davidson returned the kick-off with a huge up-and-under, catching Diego Albanese out of position, and Pretorius latched on to the ball to send Adrian Jacobs on a superb 30m run-in for the first try. A rattled Argentina conceded another try shortly afterwards when Davidson finished off a move that went through the entire squad. Shortly after the break the Springboks reinforced their superiority as a pacy Stefan Terblanche latched on to a half break by Pretorius and streaked his way across the field to score in the corner. The fly-halves converted two penalties apiece before Pretorius again grabbbed the spotlight by meeting a perfect pass from the replacement flank Joe van Niekerk to score beneath the posts. Later Werner Greeff took a superb up-and-under to send Pretorius on a run which took him close to the line. The ensuing feed went blind to Terblanche who scored his second try in the corner. The home side capped a memorable victory when they scored in the last minute through Bolla Conradie. - Reuters South Africa: Russell (Greeff, 43); Terblanche, Jacobs, Barry (Joubert, 76), Paulse; Pretorius, Davidson (Conradie, 70); Meyer (Rautenbach, 56), Dalton (Human, 56), Le Roux, Labuschagne (Davids, 80), Louw, Krige (capt), Venter (Van Niekerk, 65), Skinstad.
