        "bodyText": "Womadelaide certainly raises the bar when it comes to festival food. Punters are treated to top nosh from the myriad food stalls and on-site fine-dining restaurant. The Taste the World tent has also become a permanent fixture of the four-day festival, and is a place where musicians \u201cswap their instruments for cooking utensils\u201d, roll up their sleeves in a fully-equipped kitchen and cook their favourite dishes from their home countries in front of a salivating audience. Together with an assistant chef and, if required, a translator, the artists chat about their careers, homeland and what the dish means to them. When the meal is ready, the audience gets to sample the results. We\u2019ve selected recipes from four of the acts giving cooking demonstrations at this year\u2019s festival. Shakshuka Recipe contributed by Ester Rada (Israel/Ethiopia) Shakshuka is a popular Israeli breakfast dish which travelled to the Middle East with north African Jews. It\u2019s a one-frypan crowd-pleaser: eggs are poached in a spicy tomato sauce, sprinkled with feta cheese and served with pita, challah or other sauce-mopping bread. Everyone has their own theory on what makes the perfect shakshuka, and soul singer Ester Rada, an Israeli of Ethiopian origin (her Jewish refugee parents were airlifted from Sudan in 1984 as part of Israel\u2019s Operation Moses) has shared her own shakshuka recipe, which she likes to accompany with a shot of arak. Serves 5 Ingredients 4 tbsp olive or vegetable oil \u00bd medium brown or white onion, diced 1 garlic clove, crushed 1 medium green or red capsicum, chopped 4 cups tomatoes, diced; or 2 x 400g cans diced tomatoes 2 tbsp tomato paste 1 tsp chilli powder (mild) 1 tsp paprika Pinch of cayenne pepper Pinch of sugar Salt and pepper, to taste 5-6 eggs Parsley, chopped (optional, for garnish) Feta cheese, to serve (optional) 5 pieces pita or crusty bread Heat the oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic and capsicum. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and tomato paste and stir very gently (use the back of a spoon to break up the tomatoes). Add the chilli powder, paprika and cayenne. If necessary, add a pinch of sugar. Simmer for about 25 minutes; adjust taste with salt and pepper. Break an egg and slip it gently into the tomato sauce. Repeat with the remaining eggs. Cook the eggs until the whites are firm and the yolks have thickened but are not hard (about 2\u00bd-3 minutes). If the tomato sauce gets dry, add a few tablespoons of water. Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon, place on to a warm plate and serve with the tomato sauce. Garnish with parsley and sprinkle with feta cheese. Serve with any kind of bread (although pita is ideal) to soak up the sauce. Enjoy with a shot of arak (a potent, aniseed-flavoured distilled spirit). Fattet makdous Recipe contributed by 47SOUL (Palestine/Syria/Jordan) London-based Palestinian band 47Soul \u2013 whose singular sound layers Arabic reggae, mijwiz solos, Afrobeat and Palestinian dabke \u2013 have shared their recipe for this Damascene specialty. Think of fattet makdous as like a Middle Eastern nachos \u2013 the trick is in the layering. Crispy-fried pita bread is topped with a tomato-based eggplant and beef sauce, then offset with the cool yoghurt and tahini dressing and crowned with fruity bursts of pomegranate. There\u2019s a fair bit of frying involved, but the eggplant and pita bread can be baked if you\u2019d prefer to go easy on the oil. Serves 4 Ingredients 2kg eggplant Oil for frying 2 onions, chopped \u00bd kg of minced beef Pinch of cinnamon Pinch of white pepper Pinch of black pepper 4 tbsp pomegranate molasses, plus extra for garnish Salt, to taste 1 jar of tomato sauce (passata) 4 pieces pita bread, cut into cubes 2kg Greek-style yoghurt 4 garlic cloves, crushed 6 tbsp of tahini 4 tbsp of lemon juice 1 bunch of fresh parsley, chopped 1 cup of fried pine nuts 1 cup of fried almonds 1 pomegranate, seeds only Cut the eggplant into cubes and deep-fry. Drain on paper towels. Fry the onion, then add the meat. When cooked, add the cinnamon, white and black pepper. Mix with the eggplant, pomegranate molasses, salt and pepper. Stir in the tomato sauce and cook on low heat. Fry the pita bread cubes and place on a serving plate. Place the cooked eggplant and meat sauce on top of the bread. In another bowl, mix the yoghurt, garlic, tahini, lemon and salt. Pour the mix on top of the bread. Garnish with parsley, fried pine nuts and almonds, pomegranate molasses and pomegranate seeds. Chicken and green banana (plantain) curry Recipe contributed by Asian Dub Foundation (UK) This hearty Indian curry is quite a melting pot, not unlike the British band who\u2019ve shared the recipe. Asian Dub Foundation\u2019s members have roots in south Asia, the Caribbean and Ireland, their sound mixing militant politics with electronica, bhangra, punk and dub. Their live shows are spirited affairs, with plenty of pogoing and crowd provocation \u2013 you\u2019ll want something as protein and potassium-packed as this curry to power you through. Serves 8 Ingredients Vegetable or olive oil 3 sticks of cinnamon 8 cloves 4-5 cardamom pods 10 fresh curry leaves 1 tsp black mustard seeds 3 brown onions, finely chopped 8 garlic cloves, finely chopped 2 or 3 fresh chillies (choose a selection of colours and varieties), seeded and sliced 1.5kg chicken breast, diced into bite-sized chunks 4 heaped tbsp curry powder Salt and pepper, to taste 2 tbsp brown sugar 4 large potatoes, peeled and diced in medium-sized chunks 4 carrots, peeled and diced in medium-sized chunks 500g pumpkin, peeled and finely diced 2 bunches green bananas, also known as plantains (enough for 8 people), peeled and coarsely chopped 2 cans coconut milk Bunch of fresh coriander Using a very large saucepan, put in adequate vegetable or olive oil and bring to medium heat. Add a stick-and-a-half of cinnamon, the cloves, cardamon pods, curry leaves and black mustard seeds. Turn down the heat a bit and add the onions, garlic, chilli and more oil. Stir over heat until they are cooking but not browning. Add the chicken and brown a bit. Add a cup or two of water and cook on medium heat for 5-10 minutes. Add curry powder and salt and pepper to taste, then add the brown sugar. Add the potatoes and carrots, then the pumpkin. Add plantains (not chopped too small as you want these to stay undissolved). There should be more plantains than the potato and carrot combined. Add more water so the ingredients are covered, then add the coconut milk. Cook on a low to medium heat. Pop a lid on and slow cook till all the vegetables are cooked through (approximately one hour). Serve with basmati rice and sprinkle over chopped coriander. Porotos granados (Chilean bean stew) Recipe contributed by Quarter Street (Australia via Latin America) Eight-piece Melbourne salsa band Quartet Street subsisted on this filling stew while recording their self-titled debut LP. Conguero Luis Poblete \u2013 one of three band members whose parents fled Chile\u2019s military dictatorship in the 70s and 80s \u2013 swears by this dish as \u201ca good cheap meal that tastes great\u201d. The band describe their sound, which is in thrall to salsa giants H\u00e9ctor Lavoe, Eddie Palmieri, Ray Barretto and Willie Col\u00f3n, as \u201ctough, gritty and ballsy\u201d. This stew, which is not for the small of appetite, harks back to pre-Columbian times and like many dishes in Chile is delicious served with a typical Chilean salad and a side of crusty bread. Serves 4 Ingredients Stew 100g dried borlotti beans, soaked overnight 4 corn on the cob \u00bd pumpkin Olive oil 2 garlic cloves, crushed 1 onion, finely diced 1 chorizo sausage, cut into cubes 1 tsp sweet paprika (or more to taste) \u00bd tsp cumin Salt Fresh baguette (marraqueta is the typical Chilean bread roll that is ideal) Ensalada chilena (Chilean salad) 1 onion, finely diced Salt 4 Roma tomatoes, peeled and finely diced 1 bunch fresh coriander Olive oil Boil the beans in a large pot. Add the corn and pumpkin. Let it cook until the beans are soft. In a hot pan fry up the garlic, onion and chorizo; add spices and salt. When ready, add the beans. Keep an eye on the beans to make sure they don\u2019t dry out. To make the salad, place the onion in a bowl with salt; let sit. Place the tomatoes in a separate bowl then wash the salt off the onions and add them to the tomatoes. Chop a generous amount of coriander to add to the tomatoes. Oil and salt the salad. Serve the beans in bowls with the salad on top of them and some fresh bread on the side. Then, as they say in Chile, tiki tiki ti! Womadelaide 2016 is at Botanic Park, Adelaide from 11-14 March"
