As an organisation that works in fragile states we believe it is right to focus significant resources on impoverished people caught up in conflicts. They face enormous developmental challenges, and it is right that British aid is spent in this way. But we need to be careful; we should not divert resources from more peaceful countries that are already benefiting from our help as they need continued investment to accelerate the progress they are making. In these tough financial times the coalition deserves real credit for the decision to stick to the 0.7% aid target. Justin Forsyth Chief executive, Save the Children \u2022\u2008Will someone please drive a stake through the canard that the French are protesting against raising the pension age from 60 to 62 (Report, 19 October). They are not, if one is comparing like with like. Sixty-two is the age for early retirement in that nation, with correspondingly lowered benefits \u2013 same as in the US, but an option not available to the British. They are protesting a new full retirement age of 67, to be compared with proposed British reform of moving from 65 to 66 and the current American pension age of 66. Peter Baldwin London \u2022\u2008Does Iain Duncan Smith know how much bus fares cost (Report, 23 October)? Does he know that buses are an endangered species in the countryside? Caroline Musgrave Danbury, Essex \u2022\u2008Your speculation about a cold winter seemed based on holly and other berries being lavish (Report, 20 October). While many consider this a sign of cold conditions to come, in truth the berries are an indicator of the previous winter.
