Words like \"shock\" and \"surprise\" have been banded around to describe the decisions reached by five worried-looking women in their 40s, of which I am one, determined to do their very best by the 150-odd novels entered for the competition, which is open to any woman writing in English. Unlike the Man Booker and the Costa (formerly the Whitbread) there are no glamorous faces - an actress who went to Oxford, a TV host who is known as a bit of a reader - parachuted in to bulk out the panel of critics and writers who make up the judging panel. Instead, a fortnight ago we all travelled to central London, heads stuffed full of months of reading, and bags weighed down with files of notes. Apparently, what was so \"shocking\" about our longlist of 20 books was that it included titles which had previously won the Man Booker and the Costa. One commentator suggested to me off-the-record that our decision had been \"brave\", which is vaguely flattering in its suggestion that we were prepared to don flak jackets in our determination to do our literary duty, but hardly accords with what went on in the judging room. I'm not allowed to go into detail, but suffice it to say that the question of whether a book had previously won another prize was simply never mentioned. Perhaps we were naive, but we thought that we'd simply been asked to pick our 20 best books out of the 150-odd entries. The fact that we ended up including several which had previously been listed for other prizes seems to me entirely logical. Indeed, what would have been newsworthy would be if at least some of those books had not found their way on to our longlist, so adding heft to the idea that book prizes are arbitrary, random and entirely dependent on the whim of whoever happens to have the loudest voice on the judging panel. In fairness I have to say that the reaction hasn't been all bad. A man from Waterstone's chipped in to say that our longlist was \"possibly the strongest longlist for any award I've seen in some years\", which made me flush with rather a lovely feeling of accomplishment, until I remembered that it wasn't actually me who'd written the books. But by far the oddest reaction of all has been to the speech given by Muriel Gray, our chair, just prior to the announcement of the longlist. With her usual scrupulousness, Gray made it quite clear that she was speaking for herself, and not for the other judges. Nonetheless, when I read a transcript of her full speech - and here again I have, pedantically, to make it clear that I speak only for myself - the central thrust of Gray's argument seems to me a very fair record and comment on our deliberations during the longlist meeting. For while she praised to the skies the shimmering 20 titles that we eventually selected, she rightly laid into the several scores of ho-hum titles that we'd had to wade through to find them. Gray's point was that so many of the novels that we rejected displayed a particular poverty of imagination in which the writer's autobiography, barely transformed or even disguised, became the basis for a rather plodding novel. Hence the many entrants who had chosen to write about bad marriages, lost babies, and careers going nowhere. Gray calls it the rural teacher syndrome, by which I think she's referring to a kind of internal monologue in the writer's head which goes along the lines: \"I'll write about what I know even if it involves nothing more exciting than a bit of a crush I had on the deputy head last year.\" I'll break ranks here - so watch out for some more headlines about Orange judges involved in a ferocious catfight - and say I think of it more as suburban social worker syndrome. Still, the principle is the same: an inability to transmute one's own experience into something larger, stranger and, frankly, more interesting than the life which produced it. For make no mistake, there is nothing more dreary than reading mediocre fiction. My day job as a literary critic for this paper involves me ploughing through hundreds of factual titles a year, mainly in the field of history and biography. The law of averages means that much of what I read will be neither good nor bad, but simply so-so. But whereas there is something desperately depressing about reading a so-so novel - you feel as if your life is being stolen from you - there is always something that can be salvaged from the experience of reading an OK-but-not-great work of history or biography. Most crucially, the author will have been forced to imagine a world outside her own experience. While the writing itself may be pedestrian and stale - you'd be amazed by the extent to which storm clouds are forever gathering over Europe, military defeats are still humiliating, and papal nuncios inevitably wily - there remains a large granite mass of fact which acts as a balk against rampant solipsism. After spending six hours reading a workmanlike piece of non-fiction I may not have been entertained, let alone enthralled, but I will - hopefully - have been educated about anything from the Battle of Naseby to late Georgian domestic interiors. If only the same could be said for novels about rural teachers and suburban social workers. \u00b7 Kathryn Hughes is the author of The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs Beeton kathryn.hughes@btinternet.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
