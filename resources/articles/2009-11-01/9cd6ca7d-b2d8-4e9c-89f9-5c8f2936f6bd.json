But tonight, many fans hoping to catch a glimpse of U2 as they played a free concert to celebrate the anniversary of the historic event would have found a small obstacle in their way: a hastily erected wall. The organisers of the event, the music network MTV, erected a two-metre high \"sight barrier\" to exclude those without one of 10,000 free tickets from catching a glimpse of the band. The irony was not lost on fans, some of whom said they would boycott the event in protest. The 10,000 tickets for the 20-minute free concert at the Brandenburg Gate were snapped up within three hours of being made available on the internet last month. The organisers said the barrier \u2013 a metal fence draped in a white tarpaulin cover \u2013 was necessary to protect local businesses from the sheer numbers of fans expected to crowd the space around the Brandenburg Gate. MTV was not available for comment. U2's publicist, RMP, also refused to comment. Listeners to Star FM, a 24-hour Berlin rock music radio station, voted tonight to boycott the concert in protest. The station's leading DJ, Wolfi, said: \"Is this is a sick joke? A band whose leader, Bono, campaigns for world peace and freedom, puts on a concert to commemorate the fall of one of the most monstrous barriers in history, and they erect a wall to stop fans from taking part?\" He said Star FM had a contingent of tickets to give to fans, but had cancelled a competition to distribute them in protest. Wolfi said he had also issued a one-day ban on U2 songs. One online commentator wrote: \"This is supposed to be a party about unity and togetherness. But we're not allowed in. Ironic, isn't it?\" U2 lived in Berlin in 1990 to make their album Achtung Baby, which played on the themes of German division and unification and carried on its cover a picture of a Trabant, the East German car. The MTV Europe Music Awards, which are taking place in Berlin to coincide with events to commemorate the collapse of communism, were to be presented by David Hasselhoff. The star of Baywatch, who performed his song Looking for Freedom at the Brandenburg Gate on New Year's Eve 1989, was to co-present with Katy Perry. Other stars were to include Joss Stone, Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z, Foo Fighters, Green Day and Shakira. The Brandenburg Gate has been a magnet for bands during and after the cold war. Michael Jackson performed on the western side of the Berlin Wall in 1988 at a concert during which fans threw glass bottles and firebombs at the wall in protest at the communist government of the GDR. A concert staged by former Pink Floyd member Roger Waters in 1990 included Van Morrison, Sinead O'Conner and Joni Mitchell. Around 2,000 youths gathered on the eastern side to listen, and shouted \"the wall must go\". Many were beaten up and arrested by the East German police. In 1990 Pink Floyd returned to play The Wall at the same site. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 November 2009. The original said that Pink Floyd played at the Brandenburg Gate, and that David Hasselhoff was born in Germany. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
