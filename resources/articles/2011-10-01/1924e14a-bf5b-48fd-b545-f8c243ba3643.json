One large enough to accommodate two tenants as well as the environmentalist? Is there not also an attractive, sea-going kayak? No sooner had my admirable co-worker detailed his income and savings last week, in what he hopes will become a register of journalists' interests, than commentators began itemising omissions which might also, they contend, influence the way we assess his work. How about book royalties? And his pension, if any? \"Your pension is an investment,\" one reader reminded Mr Monbiot. \"Who have you invested your money with?\" Let's not forget, either, the elastic notion of a \"friend\", from whom, in this register, gifts and services need not be declared, nor the value of social perquisites, such as mixing with influential people. And what of the food in the Monbiot larder, not to mention books, shoes, furniture, electronic equipment, toiletries and possibly inherited items from a family which was \u2013 we note \u2013 of the upper-middle class persuasion? Although you can't put an exact price on being a posh boy from a la-di-dah school (Stowe) and a swank university (Oxford), various commentators thought these, too, should definitely form part of an overall assessment of the Monbiot mindset. Can a privately educated person ever earn the right to protect the icecaps? As Monbiot had anticipated, some \u2013 including me \u2013 concluded that, cash per para, he represents brilliant value; others sneered at the \"silly money\" that, as one elegantly put it, allows him to \"twat about worrying about the state of the planet\". It proved scant consolation to the frugal camp that, reading him online, they had not contributed a penny towards his upkeep. Given this peerless illustration of what it means to be damned if you do, damned if you don't, it is hard to imagine Monbiot's register catching on, even among the hacks \u2013 there must be some \u2013 who are similarly proud not to be corrupted by multinationals whose interests they covertly promote under the guise of providing robust and objective commentary. Undoubtedly, there are grounds for reform \u2013 Monbiot mentions the great philosopher Roger Scruton's stipend from Japan Tobacco \u2013 but it is a pity that his proposals for exposing the morally compromised are now likely to be dismissed by detractors along with his insistence on pay transparency, as an outbreak of classic Moonbat Utopianism. Like Ivan Lewis's eccentric proposal for striking off media malefactors, Monbiot's suggestion that being paid to write is, of itself, a faintly whiffy arrangement, one suspect enough to need confessing, is an extreme response to a real problem. Of course journalists need to protect their collective reputation from the deliberate chancers, frauds and liars who have been surfacing in the most unlikely places. As it is, by making Scandinavian-style personal disclosure the price of journalistic respect, Monbiot has transformed one campaign into another, against privacy. \"I have opened this register because I believe that journalists should live by the standards they demand of others,\" he explains. No one could quarrel with that. But, with the excellent exception of Polly Toynbee, who has disclosed her own salary, how many journalists do, in reality, demand that all employees reveal their earnings? The people subject to these demands will be either alleged rogues or accountable to shareholders (or both) or paid with public money, as with MPs, MEPs, peers, civil servants, David Cameron's special advisers, doctors, BBC employees, quangocrats, doctors, policemen, PFI profiteers, the royal family and the needy, multitudinous bankers who now survive on our charity. Naturally, it is the standard retort from all the above, when they are subjected to unwelcome inspection that, outrageously, journalists are never exposed in this way. Or only when the journalists are also politicians. The revelation that the Times used to pay Michael Gove \u00a31,000 for the product of \"an hour a week\" still gives many of us hope. In 2009, after Toynbee's candour impressed a Commons inquiry into top public pay, the MP Gordon Prentice tabled an early day motion urging \"journalists, broadcasters, commentators, politicians and others to follow her example before pronouncing on pay levels in the public sector by first disclosing their own income, earned and unearned\". If I can say so without first supplying a recent bank statement and utility bill, Mr Prentice's wilful refusal to recognise the difference between public and private funds is no more attractive than his apparent sympathy with the Daily Mail position, to the effect that anyone can be defined by a house price and no prosperous non-hypocrite could ever hold liberal views. Supposing his suasions had worked, at what point would commentators' salaries become so outrageous that they vitiated an opinion on, say, council executives' pay, as talked up by state-funded consultants? Happily for Ed Miliband, of Primrose Hill, Prentice has not as yet demanded full property valuations from anyone planning to comment, de haut en bas, on life's unfairness. It was a token, apparently, of the leader's renewed fire that he wants to \"end the cosy cartels of the way top pay is set\", to which end he intrepidly proposes an employee on every pay committee. The contention from more ambitious opponents of injustice is that the obscene gulf between the highest and lowest salaries will never be addressed until it is exposed by the end of all secrecy on pay. The most equal societies are the most open. And maybe the initial glee, shock and fury would, as predicted, subside; salaries would be compressed and we would all be happier, even in trades as unpredictable as journalism, where it would take much more than privilege, nepotism or illicit discrimination to explain why, say, a person who makes up horoscopes can earn 10 times as much as a Monbiot. But the psychology is unclear. To judge by the small number of successful women who put their names to feminist campaigns for pay transparency, openness about salaries may be about as appealing to the British public as is 60% Scandinavian-style taxation. Impossible as it might seem, greater pay transparency might prompt, in the absence of greater redistribution, discontent rather than harmony \u2013 witness the unhappy footballers and writers who have smarted, as the noble AS Byatt unforgettably did, when a showier rival was publicly awarded what Monbiot's critics call \"silly money\". \"He must believe that his name is so extraordinary that anyone will pay an extra \u00a3250,000 to have him on their list,\" said Byatt in 1995 when, by being paid like a lawyer, Martin Amis made everyone jealous. She might, as a writer, have rejoiced at the recognition. Instead: \"I always earn out my advances and I don't see why I should subsidise his greed, simply because he has a divorce to pay for and has just had all his teeth re-done.\" Journalists are no different. At the time of writing, I can find no colleagues emulating the Monbiot register. But for thinking it up, at all, its creator surely deserves a big fat bonus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
