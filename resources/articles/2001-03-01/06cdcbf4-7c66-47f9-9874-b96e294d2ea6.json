You know our views on the subject but we don't want to influence you in your final judgment on who will be prime minister! But if it's a bald bloke with wispy red hair and two K's in his surname, we'll see you at the airport. Goodnight and thank you for everything.\" The Sun, March 18, 1997 \"This is the election for the millennium. In six weeks' time, Britain will vote for a government to take it into the 21st century. The people need a leader with vision, purpose and courage who can inspire them and fire their imaginations. The Sun believes that man is Tony Blair. He is the best man for the job, for our 10 million readers and for the country. It is a momentous decision which we have not taken lightly because we still have reservations about some of New Labour's policies. But for all the Tories' achievments of the past 15 years, they no longer deserve our support. They are tired, divided and rudderless. They need a rest and so does the country. Blair is the breath of fresh air this great country needs.\" The Sun, March 4, 2000 \"Politicians must listen to what ordinary people are telling them. Unless they take heed of public anger over refugees, the door will be open for extremists who are just waiting for the chance to harness the national sense of outrage and helplessness. This is not an extreme country. Just the opposite, in fact. But even the fairest-minded nation has its breaking point. And Britain has reached it. Tony Blair must recognise the danger signals and act - before it is too late.\" The Sun, March 7, 2001 \"If an asylum seeker and his family is prepared to risk their lives to come here - might they not work hard? We're just asking - particularly as we will NEED immigrants to boost our workforce. If these people are just here for benefits they should be sent home. But if they want to work, they should be allowed to stay. And Blair should be more prepared to argue that case.\" The Sun, March 8, 2001 \"Tony Blair should clear the decks and call the election. He should do so quickly. For it is now crystal clear, after Gordon Brown's budget yesterday, that the election is in the bag. And furthermore the Sun says: Blair gets our support for a second term.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
