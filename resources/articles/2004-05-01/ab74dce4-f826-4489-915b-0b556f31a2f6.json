Northampton were earlier denied victory when Tom Curtis's second-half goal sent this exhilarating semi-final tie into extra-time. Goals by Marc Richards, Chris Hargreaves and Martin Smith looked to have taken the Cobblers through but Mansfield, having squandered their 2-0 first-leg lead, clawed back to level when Curtis fired home from the edge of the area after the Northampton defence failed to clear Bobby Hassell's free-kick. They were denied a winner seven minutes from time when Liam Lawrence's free-kick from the angle of the area on the left was brilliantly turned away by Northampton's Lee Harper. Mansfield's manager Keith Curle had a shock on Monday when he found all his back four in the treatment room but they all emerged for last night's game whereas Northampton replaced the suspended Ashley Westwood with the captain Paul Reid and Sabin returned up front from suspension in place of Derek Asamoah. Mansfield seemed to have made a dream start when Junior Mendes flicked home Wayne Corden's left-wing cross in the fifth minute but the flag was up for offside. The game was then turned on its head as Northampton scored twice in six minutes. Richards cracked in a right-foot drive from just inside the area on 36 minutes. Then Reid's free-kick was touched home by Hargreaves in a crowded six-yard box to bring the Cobblers level overall. There was more drama to come because within seconds of kicking off the second half, Northampton scored again. Hargreaves fed Smith, who fired home his 15th goal of the season with a low left-foot drive from outside the box. In the end, though, Mansfield were clinical with the penalties. \"The players were so calm when they took them because they had belief,\" said Curle. \"This night is going to stay with me for a long time.\" For his opposite number Colin Calderwood there was only sadness. \"There are lots of reasons to be proud and not too many to be disappointed but at the end the disappointment overrides everything.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
