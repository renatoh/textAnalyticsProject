A small proportion of them - around 100,000 - come in winter to ski, snowboard and telemark what is, in my opinion, the most exciting ski area in the world. The skiing takes place above Teton Village, 12 miles away from the town of Jackson in the shadow of the Teton Mountains. The rugged slopes, steep chutes, and powder bowls are some of the most exhilarating in North America. The sport is neatly arranged on two mountains, Rendezvous and Apres Vous - the latter is prime learner's territory, with a beginner network of runs at the bottom and slightly more demanding intermediate terrain at the top. This natural progression offers a gentle learning curve on slopes that are generally ignored by the macho individuals who make up Jackson's core clientele. Families are often put off Jackson Hole because of its steep and deep reputation. Certainly it is not a place for party-going teenagers. Wyoming's rigidly enforced licensing laws leave no room for interpretation. No one under 21 is permitted to enter a bar. Even those who will obviously never see their 20s again are asked to show ID. However, keen teens who join one of Jackson Hole's Team Extreme courses find that they have precious little energy for alcoholic experimentation. This demanding four-day clinic for skiers and snowboarders aged between 12 and 17 is aimed at those who have outgrown regular ski school classes and are bored by more than a day on the piste with mum and dad. My 12- and 16-year-old sons, veterans of myriad European ski classes, voted it \"the best week ever\". During the course, they skied powder, piste and moguls. They trekked uphill and even learned to abseil down rocky couloirs. Safety - from suncare and cold-weather clothing to the use of avalanche transceivers and how to dig a snow hole for survival in an emergency - was the all-important focus. For families, and indeed all skiers, whether to stay in the town of Jackson and commute the 20 minutes by bus to the mountain, or whether to stay in Teton Village is always a quandary. However, the sleek allure of five-star Snake River Lodge &amp; Spa and the brand new Four Seasons Hotel weight the balance in favour of the ski base area. The recently renovated Snake River Lodge &amp; Spa, owned by Vail Resorts, has bathrooms with steam showers and hot tubs. The indoor-outdoor swimming pool is built among the rocks with a quasi stage-set surrounding of whirlpools and waterfalls. Its spa specialises in Native American treatments. The plush new Four Seasons is the hotel of choice for those with fat wallets. It features substantial bedrooms and family-sized suites all with connecting marble bathrooms, a kids' club and games room, spa and state-of-the-art fitness centre. At the outdoor swimming pool and whirlpools, free mugs of hot chocolate are served as you wallow. Alternatively you can stay a (free) bus-ride away from the slopes in one of the spacious Teton Village Condos. These come complete with gigantic fridges, cookers and microwaves, dishwashers, satellite TV in every room, and the vital addition - for a family with young children - of washing machine and drier. Late-night revellers returning homewards should not be surprised to happen upon the occasional elk roaming the streets. Snow is still deep on the ground when the elk leave for the hills in the first days of April, just as the last skiers depart for the cities. In such a glorious eco-environment, it would be rewarding to think that the start of the annual elk migration - around 8,000 of them hole up for the winter at Wyoming's National Elk Reserve near Jackson Hole's airport - marks the end of the ski season. Sadly, the date is dictated by the airlines' winter programme.
