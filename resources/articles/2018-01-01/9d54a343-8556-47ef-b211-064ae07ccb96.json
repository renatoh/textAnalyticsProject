The Oscar-winning screenwriter and director was originally the subject of a lawsuit in December from a publicist who claimed he raped her. Now, three other women have come forward with accusations, according to the Associated Press. Haggis\u2019s lawyer has denied any accusations, saying: \u201cHe didn\u2019t rape anybody.\u201d In a later statement, the following has also been added: \u201cIn a society where one of a person\u2019s fundamental rights is the ability to confront an accuser, that right has now been eviscerated when it comes to anyone being charged in the press with any sort of sexual misconduct.\u201d Publicist Haleigh Breest originally accused Haggis last month of \u201ca shocking and egregious case of rape and sexual assault\u201d that occurred in 2013. \u201cThe emotional and psychological damage to Ms Breest from the attack cannot be overstated: it has been profound and lasting,\u201d the complaint read. In response, Haggis filed a countersuit claiming that the lawsuit was \u201cextortion\u201d, a $9m attempt to get money from him. The three new accusers have refused to be identified for fear of retribution. One was a 28-year-old publicist working on a television show with Haggis in 1996. She claims he forced her to perform oral sex on him before raping her. She didn\u2019t come forward because she worried that no one would believe her and that Haggis would end her career. \u201cThe power, the anger, the financial resources, you feel like you are not really a match for that,\u201d she said. A third accuser claimed to have met Haggis while pitching him a TV show idea in his office. She states that Haggis told her he had an arrangement in his marriage that allowed him to sleep with other women before trying to kiss her. \u201cI felt like my life could have been over,\u201d she said, before she managed to escape, followed by him outside. The final accuser claims that in 2015, Haggis forcibly kissed her before following her into a taxi. After many women came forward against Harvey Weinstein, Haggis was interviewed by the Guardian about sexual harassment in Hollywood, a place he referred to as a \u201cfairly sexist\u201d town. \u201cA lot of people are compromised by Harvey\u2019s alleged actions,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough everyone thinks it is vile behavior, you have got to focus on those who may have colluded and protected him. For me, they are as guilty as he is and in some cases more so, if I can say that. I mean, he was a predator and a predator is a predator. But what about those who would rather look the other way?\u201d Haggis rose to fame with race drama Crash and won two Oscars for the film. He has since written screenplays for Million Dollar Baby, Quantum of Solace and Casino Royale as well as directing In the Valley of Elah and The Next Three Days. He was previously a prominent Scientologist and has written about his process of escaping the organization. His lawyer\u2019s statement has also suggested that Haggis \u201cquestions\u201d whether or not the group has played a role in the accusations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
