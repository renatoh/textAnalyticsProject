Forget the Bosman ruling; this will be the acid test as to whether smaller clubs can survive. The freedom of contract issue was supposed to sound the death knell and force a third of clubs to pack it in but, though they have struggled, they are still in business. Now, with less money likely to be on the table for the Nationwide teams over the next few years, this could push some over the edge. It is sad to see. With the trickle of transfer fees drying up, league clubs have come to rely more and more on that source of income. In the meantime a chasm has opened up between the Premiership and the rest. When I was managing Manchester United in the 1980s our broadcasting revenue was the same as Hartlepool's or Rochdale's. Nowadays, while the Football League sides may be making more than they ever did, the top clubs rake in millions. The differential is understandable. If I was a television executive, I'd want my station to broadcast the best. Look at the number of people who want to watch the Uniteds and Arsenals. Punters want to see the best games on the box. That means the public is saturated with top-level football, with two to three Premiership matches and a couple of European games on almost every week. Both ITV Digital and Sky have introduced their specialist sports channels but the demand for less high-profile matches is simply not as fierce. ITV Digital has struggled to attract viewers, though it is difficult to judge how many subscribers it might have if everyone - myself included - could access their service. In general punters and television companies want the top-level games, so it is inevitable that the lower leagues are going to suffer. I do not think it is a sign that football's bubble is about to burst. The next broadcasting contract for the Premiership may not be as big as the last but people will always want to deal at the highest level. So the day when top-flight clubs turn to the David Beckhams of the future and refuse to meet their massive wage demands because the television money has dried up is still some way off. But the equivalent could be happening much sooner in the Football League. I have tasted life managing in the lower divisions and the only solution for the smaller clubs is to cut their cloth according to their means. It is not a matter of introducing semi-professional or regionalised football, arguments that have been mooted for as long as I can remember, though I would not be against feeder clubs. There is mileage in that. More likely the financial climate will merely stop clubs gambling as much as they used to. I remember people pointing fingers at me when I forked out a record \u00a31.5m on Bryan Robson at United, accusing me of taking a ridiculous risk by spending that amount of cash. That was no risk. The biggest gamble I ever took was in 1977 when I was managing Cambridge. We had just been promoted from the Fourth Division to the Third. I went to the board and told them that, if they gave me the money to buy a big centre-forward - Sammy Morgan from Brighton for \u00a315,000 - we would get out of that league as well. For Cambridge that kind of fee might have pushed the club under if it had not paid off. The directors backed me, found the cash from somewhere and Sammy joined. In the end we went up. The likelihood that it is going to become tighter financially in the Nationwide League will increase the pressure on those clubs struggling at the wrong end of the Premiership to claw themselves to safety. That is where the gambles could be made now. Bolton visit Blackburn tomorrow and there will be plenty of do-or-die games before the end. But Rovers, after their Worthington Cup triumph, should consider re-investing some of that cash in new personnel to ensure they stay up. I believe that win in Cardiff can provide them with the spur to survive. Clubs in the Premiership simply cannot afford to go down any more and the cash crisis in the Football League merely heaps on more pressure. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
