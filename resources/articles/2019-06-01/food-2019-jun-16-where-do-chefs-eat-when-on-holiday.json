The dish that I always want when I arrive is pad see ew. It\u2019s made with wide, flat rice noodles; the name means \u201cfried in soy sauce\u201d, because that\u2019s its main flavouring. I always get it from the same place. I don\u2019t really want to say the name of it, I don\u2019t want the whole world to descend \u2026 It\u2019s not a formal place, just a little beach hut on a bay. There are always fresh prawns and squid in the noodles, and it\u2019s slightly sweet and you have a bit of chilli and bean sprouts, too. I always get a mint and lemon shake, which is whizzed together with ice so it\u2019s a bit like a slushie. I always sit in the same spot on some rocks overlooking a bay and it feels like you\u2019re in a James Bond movie, one of those picture-perfect shots at the end, and I sit there eating my spicy sweet noodles and drinking my mint shake. Even thinking about it makes me more relaxed. Restaurant Villa M\u00e1s, San Feli\u00fa de Gu\u00edxols, Spain by Monica Galetti, chef-owner, Mere Five years ago, I went to Spain to eat at one of my favourite restaurants, Cellar Can Roca, and then on to stay in a seaside town near Girona. We went to a local seafood restaurant for lunch and had the simplest thing: a plate of local langoustines seasoned with olive oil and a bit of salt. It was just perfect: by the seaside, beautiful ingredients, a great wine list. It was so good we went back two days later for dinner. It is like that, isn\u2019t it, when you\u2019re on holiday \u2013 you find somewhere special and you go back. Jammal, Batroun, Lebanon by Anissa Helou, food writer Jammal is gorgeous, small, right on the water, in the north of Lebanon. It\u2019s one of the best fish restaurants in the country. A lot of people go there by boat, anchoring just outside the creek, and then row over in a dinghy, which gives it a very romantic atmosphere. It\u2019s a limited menu: a few mezze and then the fish of the day, caught by their own fishermen. The seafood is in a cabinet and you choose what you want and how you want it prepared. The last time I went, we had tiny red mullet, which they fry and bring with fried pitta and tahini sauce. And it\u2019s one of the few places that make tamriyeh: filo rolls with a cream inside, fried and sprinkled with icing sugar. I like to go just before sunset and stay for two or three hours enjoying the seaside, the food and the people. It\u2019s an absolutely delightful way to spend an evening. Budva, Montenegro by Olia Hercules, food writer A 10-day trip to Montenegro a few years ago was the best family holiday I\u2019ve ever had. I had just finished my second cookbook and we hired a house on the top of the mountain near Budva with my parents and some of our best friends. We spent the whole time cooking and eating. The local markets had great tomatoes and yellow beans, loads of watermelons and fantastic crumbly sheep\u2019s cheeses. The fish was good, too. We made garfish egg patties and deep-fried whitebait in fine polenta. That\u2019s what I love about going on holidays: enjoying local produce as it is, without too much embellishment, without overthinking it. Tiong Bahru market, Singapore by Chetna Makan, food writer We went here on a local tip-off, queueing for a chicken curry that was totally worth the wait. There was also a peanut pancake: a thick fluffy pancake and in between was crumbly, just-broken-up peanuts with a hint of sweetness. Oh, and the coffee! It\u2019s called kopi and is made with condensed milk. It\u2019s so strong and sweet but amazingly tasty. I would definitely go back to Singapore just to eat. Chetna\u2019s Healthy Indian (Octopus, \u00a320) is out now Murphy\u2019s Ice Cream, Dublin by Ruby Tandoh, food writer There is no bad time to eat ice-cream. I\u2019ve eaten it in blizzards and in cars and on park benches and, more often than I\u2019m proud of, in bed. But some ice-creams are particularly special. My favourite was in Dublin, on a particularly dismal day of our \u201cromantic\u201d rainy November weekend away, when we had trudged along the banks of the swollen Liffey and gone on a trip to the wind-whipped Howth peninsula. Back in the city that evening, what we needed was a mug of tea, a pint or a Supermac\u2019s. But, true to form, I insisted on ice-cream. I feigned a perfunctory Google search for \u201cDublin ice-cream\u201d despite already knowing perfectly well the where (a shop called Murphy\u2019s in Wicklow Street, decked out in smart blue and cream) and the what (its Dingle sea salt flavour). Murphy\u2019s is an old-fashioned ice-cream parlour, with familiar flavours like strawberry and chocolate nestled alongside specialities such as Irish cream liqueur. But the sea-salt flavour, made with salt from Murphy\u2019s original home in Dingle, on the country\u2019s south-west coast, was the most beautiful ice-cream I\u2019ve had. It tasted of sea air and the best thick, yellow cream. Da Adolfo, Amalfi coast, Italy by Sabrina Ghayour, food writer In 2005, I went to the Amalfi coast for a cousin\u2019s wedding. A couple of days after the wedding, we took a boat to Capri and stopped off for lunch along the way. A little rowing boat picked us up and brought us to a restaurant on the shore \u2013 you can\u2019t get there by road. Everything was picked out of the sea right in front of us. They took really fresh sea bass and baked it in salt crust. They cut spiny rock lobster in half and pan-fried it. We had amazing clams. It was nothing swanky, it didn\u2019t cost us loads of money, as everything on the Amalfi coast tends to, but it was just the most mind-blowing meal. Spaghetti Jazz, Dhaka, Bangladesh by Asma Khan, chef-owner, Darjeeling Express, London In Dhaka there\u2019s an Italian restaurant called Spaghetti Jazz, which has the most beautiful food. The owner, Shaheen Khan, has a great passion for Italy and she brought it to Dhaka at a time when there was absolutely no food from the west available in the city. Last summer, I went there just after filming my episode of Chef\u2019s Table for Netflix and had the best lobster in my life, served very simply with fresh spaghetti and garlic butter. It\u2019s a fabulous place. Dhaka is a very changed society now, but what Shaheen did 25 years ago, by starting that restaurant, was really radical. Tokyo, Japan by Angela Hartnett, chef-owner, Murano, London A few years ago, my partner, Neil, [Borthwick] and I went to Tokyo. What stood out were two amazing tempura places. At Mikawa Zezankyo, the whole menu was just pictures of the dishes and we were blown away by how simple and incredibly delicious everything was. The second place, Miyagawa, was a really old tempura bar with 10 seats. The guy who ran it must have been 70 and did everything himself. I\u2019ve never had better tempura. There are brilliant places in New York and London that do it, but nothing compares with Tokyo. San Sebasti\u00e1n, Spain by Nuno Mendes, chef-patron, M\u00e3os I love San Sebasti\u00e1n. My first ever holiday with my partner was there and I\u2019ve probably been back five or six times. It has lovely beaches, it\u2019s affordable and the food is outstanding. On my most recent visit, I went to a restaurant called Ibai and it was the most inspiring meal that I\u2019ve had in years. It\u2019s an old-school Basque restaurant in a little basement room that\u2019s only open during the week for lunch. Everything we ate was incredible: the lobster salad with citrus dressing, the teardrop peas, the St George mushrooms. The sole was hands-down the best I\u2019ve ever had in my life, but the highlight was the kokotxas, or hake throats, which were so good we had to order seconds. There are very few really old-school restaurants like that around any more. We should treasure them. Mother\u2019s Kitchen, Naivasha, Kenya by Claire Thomson, food writer Earlier this year, my family had a really memorable meal at Mother\u2019s Kitchen. We had the local dish of githeri, a beany casserole, and ugali, a maize porridge which soaks up the stew. There was also amazing plantain cooked with tomato and ginger and a pile of chapatis and samosas. It was a bare-bones restaurant with Formica tables and a dinner lady who piled a mountain of food on to your plate, but so delicious. It was a special trip for me because I was born in Africa, living in Zimbabwe and then Botswana, and this was the first time I\u2019d gone back with the kids. Edinburgh, Scotland by Sam Evans, co-founder, Hang Fire Southern Kitchen, Barry I was absolutely blown away by eating in Edinburgh, from street food to fine dining. El Cartel is a taco joint with amazing vegan and vegetarian tacos. L\u2019Escargot Bleu is everything you want in a classic French bistro: Le Creuset, vintage posters, pots simmering away for hours. We heard that Ondine did the best seafood: it\u2019s quite swanky, very decadent and a little bit expensive. It was out of this world. At the Edinburgh Food Studio I had probably the best brunch of my life of slow-cooked scrambled eggs, and homemade chocolate spread with buttermilk brioche and gorgeous marmalade. There was a swagger and huge sense of pride about everywhere that I went. They know they\u2019re good. And as an eater, you know you\u2019re in safe hands. Peace Palace Chop Bar, Osu, Ghana by Zoe Adjonyoh, chef-owner of Zoe\u2019s Ghana Kitchen, London On holiday last August, I went on a two-day walking tour of Accra with my wife, Sara, to find the best places for local food. Peace Palace Chop Bar in Osu isn\u2019t much from the outside \u2013 a rickety affair as most chop bars are \u2013 but backstage is a full production of maybe a dozen women toiling over huge vats of stews and soups, or thumping fufu into shape, or churning banku out of its dense porridge-like state into perfect rounds. After investigating the various vats, I sat down to eat a huge bowl of goat \u201clight soup\u201d, a clear, spicy broth popular in Ghana. I finished it in minutes. My face was covered in soup, my lips and tongue were stinging, but my belly was full and my smile was wide. It was insanely delicious \u2013 the goat so tender, the broth addictive in its depth of flavour, yet incredibly light. I found a new standard for light soup at Peace\u2019s chop bar and a new level of respect for its preparation. Penang, Malaysia by Fuchsia Dunlop, food writer Penang is a famous centre of street food. I stayed in George Town, which was the first British settlement in south-east Asia, and it\u2019s a mix of colonial architecture, mosques, Chinese temples. Culturally, it\u2019s a fascinating mix, so the food is like that, too: a mash-up of Chinese, Malay, Indian, Thai and Peranakan, which is Straits Chinese \u2013 a mix-up in itself of Chinese and Malay influences. For me, it was particularly interesting because they\u2019ve got Chinese food \u2013 mainly from the south: Cantonese, Teochew and Hokkien, styles from Guangdong/Fujian \u2013 mixing up with all these south-east Asian influences and then some Indian spices as well. One of the classic Penang street food dishes is char kway teow, stir-fried rice noodles with seafood and beaten duck egg and bean sprouts. Another famous one is Assam laksa, made with mackerel, tamarind, pineapple, chilli and mint, so you get this amazing spice, fruitiness and sourness. Peranakan food is from these mixed families with Chinese and Malay influences. One of the most delicious things I had of that cuisine is called otak-otak. It\u2019s sort of a fish mousse that\u2019s seasoned with makrut lime and chilli and then steamed in banana leaves. Alfama, Lisbon by Ramael Scully, chef-owner, Scully, London The last holiday I really enjoyed was in Lisbon because I didn\u2019t go to any cheffy restaurants. It was just nice to eat sardines on the bone, grilled with a bit of lemon on the side. When you\u2019re dealing with crazy flavours all the time, sometimes you need some classic cooking in your life. Lisbon is beautiful \u2013 I started thinking, this could be my retirement plan right here. I went with an Australian friend, who I catch up with once a year in a different city. We stayed in Alfama, the old part of Lisbon, and didn\u2019t go to any posh places, just little dinky restaurants such as Taberna Manuel da Gorda and Casa da Tia Helena. Sicily, Italy by Alison Roman, food writer Last year, I went with a friend to Sicily and we rented places in Palermo and Salina, one of the Aeolian islands off the northern coast. We didn\u2019t eat at restaurants all that often; it was more that they had incredible markets and I was able to do so much excellent cooking. I grew up in California, which I felt had the most perfect produce, but Sicily might have it beat \u2013 the tomatoes, the garlic, the capers and the seafood, which was so fresh and cheap. On Salina, we stayed near the harbour in the town of Santa Marina. Down the road, a woman ran a tiny fish counter called Pescheria a Lampara and she sold beautiful squid, shrimp and swordfish. I\u2019d never seen anything like that seafood. Pittulongu, Sardinia by Chantelle Nicholson, chef-patron, Tredwell\u2019s I went to Sardinia with a good friend in 2010 and we stayed at a little hotel right on the beach in Pittulongu. It was in the middle of nowhere, not very touristy, but we discovered a little food shop about 20 minutes\u2019 walk away which had the most incredible produce: cured ham that they sliced to order, beautiful cheese, and tomatoes that were perfectly ripe and super-sweet. It was so simple but delicious and we lived on it for the next few days, going back to the shop a couple of times in the hot beating sun to stock up. That holiday really stays in my mind because everything we ate was so good. Ming Fu, Taipei by Erchen Chang, chef and co-owner, Bao and Xu, London Ming Fu does classic Taiwanese cuisine. It\u2019s very small \u2013 a husband and wife team, with six tables. You need to pre-book their really famous dishes: crab glutinous rice and Buddha jumps wall, a soup with amazing stock (you can have it made not on the traditional shark\u2019s fin base) in which they cook loads of delicacies. My favourite thing was the grilled baby abalone with soy-glazed mayo \u2013 perfect in terms of texture, so tender. The cooking and thinking behind the dishes are the kind of things that inspire me for Xu. Asador Etxebarri, Axpe, Spain by Ana Gon\u00e7alves, chef and co-owner, T\u0100 T\u0100 Eatery Asador Etxebarri in the Basque Country is probably my favourite restaurant in the world. My partner Meng and I went for my birthday in 2017 and we went back for his birthday this year. The location, about an hour outside San Sebasti\u00e1n, is amazing and the products and the way they cook them is, for me, close to perfection. It\u2019s a family-run restaurant that focuses on cooking with fire, although it\u2019s done much more gently than you\u2019d expect. My favourite dish is the grilled whole squid, served with caramelised onions and black ink sauce. They also do a reduced milk ice-cream using smoked milk. Meng and I always joke that if we ever get married, we\u2019ll get married at Etxebarri."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
