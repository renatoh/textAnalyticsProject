It was pressed against the snow and I couldn't move. As a result of my less than timely daydreaming, I had just humiliated myself by nose-diving down a steep T-bar run in front of my giggling friends and smiling Austrian families on my second morning's skiing. I hope they were smiling because, like everyone else on the mountain, they were simply delighted at how much snow there was and that the sun had just broken through the clouds. Luckily for me, an Austrian dad waded through the thigh-high snow to rescue me, my pride and my tangled skis and legs. It was an inauspicious start to the snowiest week's skiing I'd had in years. Set in the Dachstein Mountain region in the province of Steiermark, Schladming dates back to medieval times and was once the site of ore mining. It's not that easy to find out about Schladming - there's a website that's in serious need of updating and a couple of British ski brochures that feature it, but that's pretty much it. It is apparent, however, that Schladming isn't your average ski resort relying solely on the tourist trade. It's a traditional working town in its own right and happy to stay that way. As a result, there's little language concession for tourists - all the menus we saw were in German, as were piste maps and mountain signs. We were lucky, however - one of our group had once worked in Schladming as a ski rep and we quickly promoted her to the lofty station of chief translator and ski guide. Schladming is a huge favourite among the professional skiing fraternity and with good reason: it hosted the 1982 World Ski Championships, ensuring it joined other top European resorts as a world-class international venue and has continued to host World Cup downhill events ever since. Both the men's and women's downhill slopes are firm favourites with all skiers - that might all sound a bit serious and grown-up, but it's the type of place where there really is decent skiing for all levels, although the emphasis rests largely on intermediate skiing. Most slopes are north facing and about half of them are reds. The rest are a mix of blues and blacks and all served by the most efficient chair and lift system I've ever come across. Queues were negligible and this was during the Viennese half-term. Our days began with eating large quantities of semmels (Austrian crusty bread rolls), eggs, ham, cheese and lots of coffee, followed by a minute's walk from our hotel to the nearest chairlift. Schladming is a four-mountain interconnected skiing area, ranging in height from 6,069ft to 6,610ft, with 100 miles of pistes. The weekly ski pass covers them all. We spent the first few days finding our ski legs on the Planai and Hochwurzen mountains, which have a decent spread of long friendly blue runs and nice wide and well-groomed reds. The abundance of snow meant we were able to ski right down to the bottom. It's easy to get around with a regular free bus service between mountains. The incentive to get up early was massive. The snow was perfect. Some days it was so soft the skiing almost felt like having wings - well, apart from my daily tangles with T-bars that is. The sun obliged and came out most days - we celebrated by sharing my hipflask, filled with my mother's homemade Polish damson vodka. Fantastic. Then it was back to sliding through the snow and trees, smiling, whooping and wondering which bit of the mountain to tackle next. The busiest slopes were always those at Hochwurzen and Planai, the closest to the town, so we spent the second half of the week at the Reiteralm and Hauser Kaibling mountains. The one really busy day was Sunday when the mountains filled up with locals as well as weekenders from Salzburg. Like Chamonix to Geneva residents, it is a popular resort with nearby city-dwellers. It seems British tour operators have been slow to discover Schladming despite its nearness to Salzburg. One of our group took the afternoon off, catching the train into Salzburg for a dose of Mozart culture and classy retail therapy. At only \u20ac30 (\u00a320) for a train ticket, it hardly broke the bank. The rest of us contented ourselves with a night out in town sampling the beer from Schladming's own brewery. Other evenings were spent either in town or at our fantastic hotel eating incredibly filling Austrian food (think huge slabs of pork and fist-size potatoes), inventing unrepeatable names in mock German for snowboarders and drinking fine Austrian wines as the snow just fell and fell. Perfect. Factfile Seven nights' half board with Crystal Holidays (0870 848 7000) staying at the Zum Kaiserweg Hotel in Schladming costs \u00a3415, including British Airways flights. More information on Schladming is available on their website.
