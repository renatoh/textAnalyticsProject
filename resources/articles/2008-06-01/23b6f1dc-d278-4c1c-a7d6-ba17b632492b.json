The season starts in May with early varieties such as Green Globe, and can extend well into September. A good mid-season variety to look out for now is Gros de Leon, which has the biggest heart of any artichoke. You'll find both green and purple-tinged varieties. There's little difference in flavour, though aficionados say greens have the edge. \u00b7Storage-wise, artichokes are quite forgiving - it's best to use them as fresh as possible, but they'll still be pretty good after a week in the fridge. Put cut artichokes into water laced with lots of lemon juice or they will discolour. Don't cook in pans made of iron, aluminium or any other reactive metal for the same reason. \u00b7 Globe artichokes grow well in the UK as long as they get enough warmth, and British-grown examples are becoming more widely available. Some growers offer them on a pick-your-own basis - try Secretts at Hurst Farm in Godalming, Surrey (01483 520500, secretts.co.uk) or Rectory Farm at Stanton St John, Oxford (01865 351677). Go to pickyourown.org to see if artichokes are grown at any farm near you. If you are picking your own, take a sharp knife for cutting the artichokes from the plant. \u00b7 You can order British-grown globe artichokes from ethicalfoods.co.uk - Gros de Leon are currently available."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
