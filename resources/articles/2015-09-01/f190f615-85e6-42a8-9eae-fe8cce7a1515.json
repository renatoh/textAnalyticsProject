He started his week as Labour leader trying to be unpolished, but after three troublesome days where he conducted a shambolic reshuffle with a man who praised the \u201cbravery\u201d of the IRA at its centre, upset his own MPs by pointedly refusing to sing the national anthem, and pulled out of media interviews while being followed in eerie silence down the street by journalists, he came to the same conclusion as the makeup artists: the natural look needs careful crafting. So now he\u2019s got a spin doctor, his shadow chancellor has offered his version of an apology for his IRA comments and he will sing the national anthem at future public events. It was easy to be effortlessly charming as a backbencher when you spoke only for yourself: Corbyn is now realising that his new job requires greater artistry. Neal Lawson Chair of soft-left pressure group Compass He wasn\u2019t supposed to be elected \u2013 he was. He couldn\u2019t form a shadow cabinet \u2013 he did. But the challenges facing Corbyn remain huge. At some stage he has to confront the party\u2019s head-on collision with the British public last May and social democracy\u2019s car crash with history the world over. Until then only one thing matters: riding the progressive wave that swept him into the leader\u2019s office. Crowdsourcing prime minister\u2019s questions was a good start but the same spirit of openness and democracy must gush through the whole of a party that now reflects the culture of Facebook \u2013 not the factory. The affiliation of the new members and supporters is fleeting and fluid \u2013 but can be sweeping in scale as we have seen. Keeping their attention and therefore their energy will define his leadership. Rosie Fletcher Corbyn supporter Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s first week instills the quiet confidence he himself showed at PMQs. By bringing members\u2019 questions to the prime minister, he builds upon the grassroots support that made him leader. I\u2019d like to see him mix these with his own, stronger line of questioning, or he risks giving Cameron a platform to drop soundbites while ignoring issues: but for a first outing from the backbenches, it puts the people\u2019s voice back where it belongs in parliament. It hasn\u2019t all been a bed of Labour roses. The nastier parts of the popular press have overplayed their critical hand; but by making it clear that they will damn Corbyn singing or silent, he is able to act to his own agenda without having to immediately chase tabloid approval. Likewise, those in Labour who refuse to play ball undermine the party\u2019s electability that they claimed as the key issue throughout the leadership contest. Corbyn\u2019s promising first week and iron-clad mandate are going to make him harder to shift than they all may hope. Chris Mullin Author and former Labour minister It\u2019s not much fun being leader of the opposition, still less if you are the leader of the Labour party in opposition. And if you have been elected in the teeth of unremitting hostility from 90% of your colleagues \u2026 well, that\u2019s scary. In the circumstances Jeremy\u2019s not done too badly. He\u2019s put together a more or less credible shadow cabinet \u2013 a coalition of the willing. He did better than most people expected at prime minister\u2019s questions. Although no great orator, he comes over well in one-to-one interviews. His failure to join in the national anthem was unfortunate, but his oppressors would have got him either way \u2013 if he\u2019d joined in, he would have been accused of hypocrisy. His next big challenge is going to be the Labour party conference. My advice: address the nation rather than the party and learn to use an autocue. Professor Rohan McWilliam Director of the Labour history research unit, Anglia Ruskin University Clearly something changed in British politics last week \u2013 but what? A leftwing leader surrounded by Blairites. A majority female shadow cabinet but no women in the top jobs. A new approach to prime minister\u2019s questions \u2013 but one that probably suits Cameron and which (whisper) was just a little bit dull. Two things will probably prove decisive. The first is the appointment of John McDonnell as shadow chancellor, a clear statement about direction of travel. The other (more ominous for Corbyn) is Tom Watson telling Andrew Marr that he has his own mandate. The drum beat towards civil war within Labour gets louder. Overall, there was a lot here to help Labour get more votes \u2013 in seats it already holds. Far less has been done to reach out to middle England voters who are decisive in winning elections. George Osborne must be wondering how big his landslide will be in 2020. Deborah Mattinson Founder of research and strategy consultancy BritainThinks \u201cOld fashioned\u201d and \u201csocialist\u201d (no compliment intended) were the words most often chosen to describe Jeremy Corbyn by BritainThinks\u2019 panel of undecided voters last weekend. A couple of rambling speeches name-checking unions they didn\u2019t know existed, and a muddled shadow cabinet selection ending in an all-male top team won\u2019t have challenged their expectations. A nice idea about trying something different with PMQs only succeeded in making Cameron look, well, prime ministerial, but the worst gaffe in a gaffe-filled week was surely Corbyn\u2019s reluctance to sing the national anthem. Small wonder that new polling shows the public don\u2019t trust him to defend the country \u2013 or do anything else much that might be expected of a national leader. Corbyn\u2019s stunning win spoke to a deep dissatisfaction with politics as usual but this first week will not have persuaded many voters that he would replace the status quo with anything better."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
