Nurses and other health care professionals will be able to train to become surgical care practitioners with the authority to carry out minor procedures such as removing skin lesions and conducting varicose vein operations. They will also be able to hold consultations with people in outpatient clinics before and after they have had an operation, health minister Lord Warner revealed. Lord Warner said: \"By developing the roles of healthcare staff we are able to offer patients skilled practitioners who are able to carry out simple surgical procedures - freeing up doctors to deal with more difficult cases.\" The two-year training programme will be open to nurses, physiotherapists and operating department assistants who, on qualification, will become part of the surgical team. The proposals are supported by the Royal College of Surgeons of England provided that practitioners work under supervision, and that surgeons retain clinical responsibility for patients. President of the RCS, Hugh Phillips, said: \"We welcome the full integration of surgical care practitioners into the team and support their important role - provided they are working under supervision - in carrying out components of peri-opearative and operative care and playing a part in diagnostic procedures.\" But he added: \"We do not support the direct referral or transfer of patients for surgical therapeutic procedures to non-medically qualified practitioners working on their own.\" Jill Biggins, national chairwoman of the National Association of Assistants in Surgical Practice, also welcomed the proposals. She said they were an improvement on past, when training for surgical care practitioners (SCPs) had been on an ad hoc basis. She said: \"We are pleased to participate in the first generic surgical care practitioner curriculum framework, and view this document as a key milestone in the evolution of the SCP role.\" A government pilot project involving 54 health professionals working as surgical care practitioners was launched in February 2003 but today's announcement means there will in future be a national training programme for SCPs. The department of health confirmed that SCPs will work under the supervision of a consultant surgeon who will retain overall responsibility for patient care. The document, curriculum framework for the surgical team, which gives details of the proposed training and the curriculum that should be followed to become an SCP, is now out for consultation until the beginning of June. Head of policy at the Royal College of Nursing, Harry Catton, said the opportunity to train as surgical care practitioners illustrated how nurses can take on extended and advanced roles. But he added: \"The vast number of people already undertaking these roles are nurses and I think that their nursing background is absolutely critical in putting them in the position where they can take on these extended roles. \"I think I would be very cautious if it was suggested that there could be some form of direct entry into SCP training as opposed to the route coming through nursing.\" The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, criticised the proposals fearing they will affect the surgical training opportunities for junior doctors. The BMA was also worried that the title 'surgical care practitioner' might confuse patients who may think they were being treated by a doctor. Mr Simon Eccles chairman of the BMA's junior doctors' committee said: \"These proposals don't account for how a new raft of people performing surgery - but who are not doctors and will not be taking responsibility for patients - would be matched to the workload and development of the surgical team as a whole.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
