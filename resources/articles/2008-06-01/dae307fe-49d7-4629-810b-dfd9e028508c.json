I accompanied them to the library. The next hour was magic. Selecting two past questions, we set about planning answers. We each created spider diagrams across A3 pages and pin-pointed revealing moments in the book. The process of planning answers for the essay questions was completely absorbing: taking apart the title, brainstorming and then, the clever bit, grouping the seemingly isolated events and characters together and spotting the trends, the themes, and finally taking the step even further back and trying to make sense of what Salinger is saying. And then, for the greatest trick, \"Let's all take a few minutes to write the opening sentence, something that grabs the examiner. I like starting with a quotation.\" We share the sentences and they all coo and sigh when I read mine. \"Miss, that's so good.\" This is too much fun. They are appreciating the art of a crafted first sentence. In one hour, the five of us covered more ground than I'd been able to in a whole month of lessons with the class. Is it naive and obvious to say I'm not sure trying to teach rowdy, disaffected teenagers in groups of 30 is productive? What struck me was that we really worked. Deep and unbroken concentration is too rare with the full quota of 30 students. I know this is partly my teaching, but it is also that many of the students do not share the work ethic that they need to make the kind of progress that would take them out of the bracket of disadvantage. Working in small groups changes that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
