Now there is another subject in which Donald Trump\u2019s expert knowledge surpasses that of everybody else: wind turbines, though he calls them windmills. \u201cI\u2019ve studied it better than anybody I know,\u201d the president asserted in a bizarre segment from a weekend speech to young conservatives in West Palm Beach, Florida, close to his winter retreat at Mar-a-Lago where he is spending the holidays. \u201cI never understood wind. You know, I know windmills very much. They\u2019re noisy. They kill the birds. You want to see a bird graveyard? Go under a windmill someday. You\u2019ll see more birds than you\u2019ve ever seen in your life.\u201d Trump ripped into a range of familiar targets in a speech lasting more than one hour at the Turning Point USA student action summit, from the Democrats and House speaker Nancy Pelosi, to his recent impeachment and the so-called Never Trumpers in the Republican party who he said were \u201cthe dumbest human beings on earth\u201d. But it was his rambling and often nonsensical remarks about wind turbines, during a diatribe against the Green New Deal and renewable energy resources, that raised eyebrows. \u201cThey\u2019re made in China and Germany mostly,\u201d Trump said of wind turbines, of which there are more than 57,000 across the US, according to the American Wind Energy Association. \u201cBut they\u2019re manufactured tremendous if you\u2019re into this, tremendous fumes. Gases are spewing into the atmosphere. You know we have a world, right? So the world is tiny compared to the universe. So tremendous, tremendous amount of fumes and everything. \u201cYou talk about the carbon footprint, fumes are spewing into the air, right? Spewing. Whether it\u2019s in China, Germany, it\u2019s going into the air. It\u2019s our air, their air, everything, right?\u201d It was unclear what exactly Trump meant, or how Trump equated wind turbines converting clean air into energy to toxic fumes fouling the atmosphere. But he did share his thoughts on their appearance. \u201cYou see all those [windmills]. They\u2019re all different shades of color,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re like sort of white, but one is like an orange-white. It\u2019s my favorite color, orange.\u201d The president\u2019s \u201cwar on wind\u201d is not new: earlier this year he was ridiculed for his claims that wind turbines destroyed property values and caused cancer from their noise. He is accused of having begun his tirades against wind turbines after wind farm developments were proposed near the golf course he owns in Scotland. There is some evidence that wind turbines have a negative impact on wildlife: a 2013 study by the Wildlife Society of fatalities in California resulted in the society estimating that nationally more than half a million birds, including 83,000 raptors such as bald and golden eagles, died such deaths. The president\u2019s final words on the subject, before hailing himself an \u201can environmentalist\u201d presiding over an environment \u201cin very good shape\u201d, concerned the long-term aesthetics of wind turbines. \u201cYou know what they don\u2019t tell you about windmills? After 10 years they look like hell. They start to get tired, old,\u201d he said, lamenting that owners of ageing windmills not replacing them without government subsidies was \u201ca really terrible thing\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 December 2019 to clarify estimates of US bird deaths linked to wind turbines."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
