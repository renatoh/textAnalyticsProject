There\u2019s no special guests, not much in the way of explosive special effects and there\u2019s no attendant sense of can they do this \u2013 or how will this work? It\u2019s been 41 years since they started plying fretful suburban melancholy and rainy Sunday afternoon ennui: the first time they headlined Glastonbury was some years before a considerable portion of this year\u2019s attendees were born. These days, they release albums so infrequently that huge \u2013 and incredibly lengthy \u2013 live shows are pretty much the band\u2019s raison d\u2019etre. This kind of thing is tried and tested; it\u2019s just what they do. By the Cure\u2019s current standards, two hours constitutes a breakneck canter through the highlights of their back catalogue. It centres on their imperial phase, bookended by 1985\u2019s The Head on the Door and 1992\u2019s Wish, a period during which the Cure came within kissing distance of being the biggest band in the world, while somehow managing to retain a certain outsider status: Pictures of You, A Night Like This, Love Song, Never Enough, In Between Days. Listening to them play, you\u2019re struck by the fact that they pulled off the trick of traversing a huge musical distance \u2013 from the taut post-punk of A Forest to the diseased-sounding psychedelia of Shake Dog Shake to the selection of more-or-less pure pop tracks that forms the set\u2019s final 30 minutes \u2013 while always sounding exactly like the Cure. For all the dark power of the tracks they play from Disintegration, the latter proves their highlight of the show, partly because it\u2019s unexpected. You get the sense that Robert Smith has quite a complex relationship with the most commercial end of his oeuvre \u2013 he exits the stage for two minutes \u201cto get my pop head on\u201d before it begins and explains that they\u2019re only doing it because \u201cit\u2019s Glastonbury\u201d \u2013 but there\u2019s something particularly joyous about hearing one pop smash after another: Friday I\u2019m in Love following on the heels of Close to Me and The Caterpillar. And something about the light tone of the material seems to infect Robert Smith himself. Not, you suspect, one of life\u2019s natural everybody-put-your-hands-together frontmen, he nevertheless abandons his guitar and moves to the side of the stage, beneath the video screens, dancing at least a little while he sings Why Can\u2019t I Be You? Then the man who launched a thousand teenage goth haircuts catches himself, explaining again that this isn\u2019t normally how the Cure perform. \u201cI hope I don\u2019t regret doing this,\u201d he mutters, before the band launch into the concluding Boys Don\u2019t Cry. Judging by the audience reaction, that doesn\u2019t seem likely. \u2022This article was amended on 2 July 2019 to correct the release date of the Cure\u2019s album Wish to 1992."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
