Helped by two centuries, Murphy led 5-2 but could not apply the killer blow as O'Sullivan, at his best when it mattered most, reeled off the closing four frames to remain on course for his first world ranking title since the Irish Masters in March 2005. The match may have featured a clash of off-table personalities and lifestyles but with cue in hand, both approach the game with a refreshingly aggressive mindset, which guaranteed a glut of heavy scoring. Excepting a scrappy opening frame that lasted 43 minutes - almost as lengthy as several of O'Sullivan's most rapid victories - the exchanges were fast, furious and ultimately dramatic. Murphy was presented with an opportunity in the decider but, having by now seen his earlier momentum dissipate, overcut the black and O'Sullivan compiled a match-clinching run of 62. O'Sullivan, who recovered from 4-0 adrift to beat Graeme Dott 6-5 at the corresponding stage of the 2000 Scottish Open at the same venue, meets Gerard Greene or Marco Fu today for a first prize of \u00a375,000.Phil Yates Tennis Federer through Holder Roger Federer will meet unseeded Argentine David Nalbandian in the Madrid Masters final after the pair recorded semi-final victories. Nalbandian defeated world number three Novak Djokovic 6-4 7-6 (7-4) to reach his first final of the year, while world number one Federer progressed to his 10th final of the season with a 6-4 6-4 win over unseeded German Nicolas Kiefer. The 26-year-old Swiss, who will get a crack at his 15th Masters series crown today, cashed in on an early break in the third game to glide through the first set. Golf Rose in contention Justin Rose stopped feeling 'like a fool' and did his chances of winning the European Order of Merit no harm at all yesterday. A third-round 66 in the Portugal Masters at the Victoria Club in Vilamoura lifted Rose out of the pack and on to the fringe of contention. At 11 under par, the 27-year-old, who needs to finish first or second today to go top of the money list with one more event to come, was three behind Argentina's Daniel Vancsik. Vancsik led by two overnight, but that was quickly cut to one by English pair Ross Fisher and Steve Webster - two of the four players on 12 under at halfway - and also by Swede Fredrik Andersson Hed, who was eight under for the day with one to play. Scotland's Catriona Matthew finished round two of the Hana Bank KOLON Championship in South Korea just four shots adrift of leader Suzann Pettersen despite a two-over par 74. Motorcycling Pedrosa claims pole Dani Pedrosa claimed his third consecutive pole position as a last-gasp effort in qualifying put the Spaniard at the head of the field for today's Malaysian MotoGP. Pedrosa produced a lap of two minutes 1.877 seconds on his Repsol Honda at Sepang to edge out 2007 World Champion Casey Stoner by just 0.047secs. Marco Melandri took third as his Honda Grisini trailed Pedrosa by 0.067secs. Cricket India thump Australia India beat Australia by seven wickets in their one-off Twenty20 international in Mumbai. Australia made 166 in their innings, with skipper Ricky Ponting scoring 76 off only 53 balls but India passed the total with 11 balls to spare. Gautam Gambhir top-scored with 63 as fast bowler Brett Lee went for more than 11 an over. A batting masterclass from Mohammad Yousuf helped Pakistan beat South Africa by 25 runs in the second one-day international in Lahore. The series is now tied 1-1."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
