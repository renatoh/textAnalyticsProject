Further down the street, a hundred and one press crews are setting up shop, waiting to see which dignitaries will pass in front of their cameras today. My lunchtime appointment, a linguist by training if no longer by trade, is ordering our coffees in flawless French. Unlike me, he is on home turf. For two years Dr Howard Davies has been bounding back and forth between London and Brussels as London Metropolitan University's \"ambassador\", head of European development, reporting back to his institution about the latest in EU policy. He is keen to tell me why his university, formed in 2002 by the merger of two former polytechnics, the University of North London and London Guildhall University, decided to send him to Brussels. It is an arrangement that, as far as he is aware, is unique to his university. \"Our catchment areas are local, EU and global,\" he says. The EU dimension has become increasingly important. \"I don't think we're the only such university. If you look at the other ex-polytechnics in London, they will have the same thing. But they don't have a man in Brussels.\" Most British universities have in-house staff to deal with applying for research funding from the European Union. But Europe changes fast, and in most discussions it pays to be one step ahead of the game. \"I think English academics tend to regard their destiny as controlled by the higher education funding councils, and therefore by the Department for Education and Skills,\" Davies says. \"That is clearly true at one level, but both on the recruitment and the research front, and on the innovation and enterprise front, there is substantial European influence already and there will be much more in the future.\" Davies says he gives his university the ability to engage with European policy directly, particularly in areas where the line taken by the British government does not reflect the best interest of his university, or where the impact of policy on higher education is not immediately obvious. \"Horizontal cooperation inside the commission is not its strongest point,\" he says. \"I have learned more here in two years than I have since doing my PhD.\" He keeps up to date with what is happening inside all departments of the EU: education and culture, research, competition, regional policy, external relations and employment . . . all except agriculture. \"But that is only because of where London Met is,\" he says. \"If I were from somewhere else, that may have been important, too.\" Such foresight could have saved UK researchers several headaches in the past. In the medical field, a European directive drawn up to regulate clinical trials in the pharmaceutical industry is currently wreaking havoc with publicly funded trials. Research funders and trial managers in universities and NHS trusts realised too late that the directive would have an impact on them, and had no time to lobby for exemption. All they could do was to try to convince the government to mitigate the impact of the directive when it was transposed into UK law this year. A similar blunder was made by the marine science community in the run-up to Framework 6, the current round of EU funding for research and development. It failed to make its case for funding when research priorities were decided on a political level. Left out of the science priorities, it was doomed to squeeze funding applications into areas where they did not fit, rarely winning funding. \"You could spot those projects a mile off,\" one Irish research manager said. Despite not always being on the ball, UK academics have nonetheless done exceedingly well financially in the Framework programmes. In Framework 5, which ended in 2002, the UK obtained about 16%, or \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.3bn), of the available funds, of which half went to higher education institutions. In total, the UK came away with well above what it had contributed to the funding pot, and had the highest return in Europe, alongside Germany. But although UK universities are good at accessing EU funding, at London Met Davies thinks many underestimate the impact the EU will have in the next five to 10 years. \"What is clear is that with enlargement, a new parliament, a new commission and perhaps a new constitution, there will be tension between competitiveness and social cohesion. Universities have an important role to play in holding the balance,\" he says. In 2010, major European initiatives on innovation, enterprise, recruitment and research will be coming together. In that year, the Bologna process of standardising university degrees and opening up student mobility across the EU should be complete. EU governments will be spending more money on research and development with the aim of reaching the Barcelona target of 3% of GDP; 1% should come from the public sector and the remainder from industry to make Europe more competitive against Japan and the US. Other discussions are just around the corner. Last month, the commission published its proposal for the overall structure of Framework 7, the next research and development (R&amp;D) funding programme, which will run for the period 2006-2011. It is about to be the subject of a large, EU-wide political debate, and among its tenets is a doubling of the EU research budget, from the \u20ac17.5bn (\u00a311.6bn) committed for Framework 6 to \u20ac30bn (\u00a320bn). The UK government, which is currently consulting about priorities for Framework 7, has reacted positively to the idea of spending more EU funds on R&amp;D. \"The UK does believe that a higher proportion of the EU budget should be allocated to research, within overall budget constraints,\" Lord Sainsbury, the science minister, said in a speech last month. He set out three priority areas for the UK: matching the US on basic research, bolstering knowledge transfer and increasing spending on R&amp;D in industry. One of the UK government's areas of interest - basic research - would, according to the commission, be funded through a purpose-built European research council (ERC). Davies thinks this is an important reason why the UK is so keen on Framework 7. \"My impression is that the government is by and large favourable to increasing the budget . . . because it thinks it has the highest concentration of world-class universities in Europe,\" he says. The idea for an ERC was mooted during the Danish presidency of the EU in 2002. Among its fundamental principles was that its priorities should be science-driven and immune to political influence, and that its funds should be spent purely on the merit of the proposals. This is a departure from the Framework programmes' current funding ethos, which aims to build cohesion across Europe through research collabora tion. For UK researchers, such constraints often led to marriages of convenience with non-research-intensive countries such as Portugal - a major complaint in Framework 5. The UK research councils are in favour of an ERC, says Jim Sadlier, director of strategic planning at the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council. He thinks the ERC will drive up quality more than national funding sources could hope to, since in addition to funding excellence they are also required to nurture the national science base. The added value will come only if the ERC does not cannibalise national funding: \"The money must be additional, or you will lose that effect.\" Sadlier says the funding decisions made by the ERC will be a useful benchmark for the UK science base, which rates its chances of claiming a lot of the money fairly highly. \"This is a damn good way of finding out whether it is as good as it thinks it is,\" he says. One university that in theory could run away with a large part of the ERC pot is the University of Cambridge. It distributes on average \u00a310m of EU funding every year between 400 different research projects, and is one of the UK's top recipients of Framework money. For Cambridge, ERC funding is a moot point, says Dr David Secher, the university's director of research ser vices. He expects his institution could walk away with a lot of the funding, but the question is whether it will want to. As a top research university, Cambridge can \"pick and choose\" for funding, and if the ERC will not contribute funding for overheads - which UK funders will soon have to do - then EU funding will make little economic sense. \"I'm not sure being the top recipient of ERC funding is something we would aspire to then,\" he says. Meanwhile, Howard Davies is concerned that research conducted outside the top research universities will fall between the slats of the ERC. \"My view is that there is excellence in universities across the spectrum in the UK, and not just in those where the research activity is very intense. I would look for procedures at a European level that would allow for those pockets of excellence in the majority of universities to be identified. Particularly in social science, you would expect excellence to be spread more widely, because it is not so costly.\" He says there is a risk that the new funding for excellence would encourage further research concentration in the UK. \"It would be unwise if the EU would allow itself to be steered by member states towards the universities that are being concentrated on at national level,\" he says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
