But the resemblance to Lord Hurd is merely social and physical. Unlike many of the rich men who stumble into the world of political donation, Mr Wheeler is not a political junkie and has no discernible bee in his bonnet other than to see a Tory government re-elected. It is said by a man who studies odds well enough to have been thrown out of Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, to have played bridge a couple of times with Iain Macleod (a world-class player and Tory chancellor), and to have founded and - last July - floated his IG Index spread betting firm for (his share) \u00a390m. He also played backgammon with his friend, Lord Lucan, two days before \"the incident\" as he calls the murder of the peer's nanny, Sandra Rivett, and Lucan's disappearance. None of this is said with any bravado. Nor is his explanation of the \u00a31m first instalment he handed over to Mr Hague on Wednesday. \"The Conservative party is desperately what the country needs, it's desperately short of funds. It's almost no skin off my nose to do it, so why not do it?\" he says a few minutes after explaining for the umpteenth time yesterday that \"whether you have \u00a390m or \u00a385m does not alter your way of life a scrap.\" What it could do, he believes, is help to decide the election. \"It's not a gesture, it's been given to give them a real chance of winning. The only condition I imposed was that the money should be used to try and win, not to try and make a good show.\" He's a Business for Sterling critic of the euro, but not fanatically. \"I'm a free marketeer. But I haven't always voted Tory, I didn't vote Tory last time. I voted tactically (in Labour-held Vauxhall) for the Liberal Democrats, a very, very good black candidate (BA manager Keith Kerr). I once voted for the Abolish the GLC candidate.\" Anti-Ken Livingstone then? Yes and no; he sat next to the mayor at dinner recently - \"a wonderful dinner companion but not very good at running the GLC\". It was at an entrepreneurs' breakfast that he first met Mr Hague in 1999. He liked him better than Mr Livingstone. \"Then a local friend arranged a fundraising dinner at White's. It was made clear on the invitation that if you accepted you would make a contribution. I said I'd contribute if I floated my company.\" Up to that point he had never given more than \u00a350 to his party. Last year he gave \u00a330,000, plus \u00a31,000 to the Vauxhall Tories. After Labour landed its three \u00a32m cheques from equally wholesome donors, he sought an interview and told Mr Hague right away: \"I'd like to give \u00a35m.\" By now he has perfected the line: \"I want nothing for myself, nothing for the company, I would reject a peerage.\" All he wants is a prime minister who will \"not be interested in spin, the latest focus group or what the opinion polls say\". A simmering dislike of Labour surfaces here. He dislikes Tony Blair's smile (\"not his fault\") and his political correctness. But he recoils from any suggestion that Gordon Brown's or Jack Straw's gambling review might take revenge by taxing spread betting winnings. \"That would be deplorable, but I don't think they'd do it.\" Labour might put spread betting under a single gambling regulator, but he would not lose any sleep over it. He may still be worth \u00a385m, but he does not live in grand style and IG's headquarters is in \u00a312 per sq ft Southwark, not just across the Thames in the City. \"Yes, I'm an Old Etonian, but I'm also a self-made man.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
