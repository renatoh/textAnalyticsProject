This time last week Leigh Halfpenny was back home in Cardiff nursing a thigh injury and fearing the worst about his prospects of joining the South African odyssey. Barely 72 hours ago Gordon D'Arcy was en route to San Francisco for a holiday. Wearing a red jersey against the Free State Cheetahs this afternoon will be a surreal experience for them. On this trip, though, outsiders and latecomers have no time for contemplation or introspection. There are now 38 players in the enlarged tour squad and the sifting process is about to begin in earnest. If the 20-year-old Halfpenny enjoys an assured Lions debut today he will swiftly make up lost ground. If, on the other hand, he and D'Arcy struggle to adjust to the thin air and unfamiliar surroundings they will be consigned to an endless game of catch-up. Both men, however, must already sense the fates are smiling on them. Halfpenny's long-range goalkicking \u2013 \"The ball flies at least 10 metres further out here than it does at home\" \u2013 and attacking instincts may yet prove valuable, but simply taking the field will be a relief beyond compare. \"When I was told I was staying at home I was devastated. I thought, 'My tour's been taken away and it's all over.' I just didn't know how long the injury would take, or whether it would heal too late for me to come. It was heartbreaking to leave the boys and watching the first game was tough. It just made me more determined to work hard and get out there.\" Thanks to the Cardiff Blues physio team, at least one of whom sacrificed several days of his holiday to treat the diminutive winger, there was a happy ending. As Ian McGeechan explained yesterday there was a logic to Halfpenny's temporary exile from the tour as the head coach did not want the long-term injured distracting the medical staff from day-to-day duties. The long hours on the treatment table also gave the restless patient time to reflect on his rapid rise, even if being responsible for the cuddly lion mascot can be problematic. D'Arcy's story is an equally rollercoaster one. Last year he fractured his right forearm in eight places after an attempted tackle on Italy's Andrea Masi went badly wrong. Three operations, including bone grafts and the insertion of a six-inch plate, sidelined him for almost 12 months, long enough to raise fears the gifted centre's career might be on the line. Even when he made a fairytale return to share in Ireland's grand slam triumph and Leinster's European title surge there remained one unfinished piece of business. Four years ago in New Zealand he was said to have made himself unavailable for the final Lions Test in Auckland because of \"general fatigue\". When he was omitted from the original squad for South Africa, there were whispers he had not been forgiven. In the sunny grounds of the team hotel yesterday, however, a very different version of events emerged to the one supplied by Sir Clive Woodward at the time. \"I can't tell you what went through his head or why he said it. I didn't pull out from any game,\" D'Arcy insisted. \"I was very disappointed with how that came across in the media; I nearly fell over when I heard. I've had a lot more challenging things in my life since then and I've come through with flying colours. I've been given a great opportunity by Geech and I'm not here to prove anything to anyone.\" Instead, on the 14-hour flight from California to Johannesburg, he concentrated on ensuring he was mentally ready to fill the gap currently left by Riki Flutey's knee strain. \"You always have that little hope your phone will ring. I've come here to fill in, but if I carry my form on you never know what can happen. I've looked at the video of Wednesday's game and Brian [O'Driscoll] and Jamie [Roberts] did pretty much everything right. But in the same way I always had a little candle burning that I might come out here, I also have a little candle burning that I can force my way into the Test side.\" His familiarity with O'Driscoll will clearly help and he had a fine game for the Barbarians against England last Saturday. The 29-year-old from Wexford, a replacement today, has also displayed considerable strength in adversity following his arm injury. \"There were a couple of dark days when you don't think it'll happen, but the surgeons were always pretty confident I'd get back.\" If the Lions Test call comes again you suspect the revitalised Mr D'Arcy will grasp it with both hands."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
