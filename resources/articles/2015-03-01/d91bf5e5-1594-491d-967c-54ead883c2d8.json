In fact she worked at a Save the Children treatment centre in Sierra Leone (Going viral, page 32). \u2022 In a piece about the singer-songwriter Prince (Hidden 4 U, 20 March, page 10, G2), we stated inconclusively that \u201cthe story goes that if [he] were to leave the world tomorrow, he has enough unreleased material to put out an album a year\u201d. An album a year for how long, some readers reasonably asked. Until sometime in the 22nd century, we ought to have said. A typo later in the piece \u2013 the omission of an S \u2013 had us referring to some of Prince\u2019s \u201ccloset collaborators\u201d. \u2022 St Clement Danes school was in East Acton when Andy Fraser was expelled from it for refusing to wear his hair short, not in Chorleywood, Hertfordshire, as we had it in our obituary of the bass player and songwriter with the British blues-rock band Free (19 March, page 41). The school moved to the latter location in 1975. \u2022 Other recently corrected articles include: To understand the pyramids and Stonehenge, look up \u2013 not down Ecuador\u2019s radical grammar pedants on a mission to correctly punctuate graffiti Florida employee \u2018punished for using phrase climate change\u2019 Bill Cosby accuser backs Nevada bill to lift statute of limitations on sex crimes Shaw Taylor obituary The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13\u00be review \u2013 quaint, charming musical"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
