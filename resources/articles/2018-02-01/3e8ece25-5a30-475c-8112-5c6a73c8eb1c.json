He has succeeded Gordon Strachan on a deal until 2020. Unrest among the Scotland support regarding McLeish relates to his departure from the same job in 2007 and after only 10 matches as a European Championship qualifying campaign ended in narrow failure. McLeish was duly hired by Birmingham City. \u201cIt\u2019s up to me to try to get the guys onside,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they are a wee bit reticent at first then I just have to get performance levels from the team which are exciting for them. The bottom line is getting the right results. \u201cListen, of course I can understand it. Not everyone is going to be happy no matter what happens. You get divided opinion. The only way to change it is by performing well and getting good results. That is the cure for dissent. \u201cWhen I looked at other guys who have gone back to take charge of their national teams for a second time, like Dick Advocaat and Louis van Gaal, I thought: \u2018Yeah, that could be on for me some time.\u2019 The opportunity arose and I felt I had to go for it. I believe it was my destiny.\u201d McLeish said he would never have accepted Birmingham\u2019s offer had Scotland reached Euro 2008. \u201cI really missed the day-to-day stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was an element of thinking I was still young enough to go and take that [club] challenge on. To be asked to go to the Premier League is an ambition that a lot of managers would have taken, probably the majority.\u201d McLeish\u2019s latest reign was afforded an inauspicious start as Alan McRae, the Scottish FA\u2019s president, recalled being on the manager\u2019s testimonial committee \u201cin season 1888-89\u201d. McRae said he had a close friendship with McLeish and that Sir Alex Ferguson was heavily influential in the manager\u2019s appointment. McLeish scoffed at any suggestion his age somehow means a draconian coaching approach. \u201cSometimes people say: \u2018Will Alex know about sports science?\u2019 I put it in to some clubs,\u201d he said. \u201cI was one of the pioneers in my younger days of introducing the analysts. \u201cIf you go back to Motherwell and Hibs you will know there were things I was trying to do there. But sometimes you don\u2019t have the money or the resources to install it in the infrastructure. When I went to Birmingham wee David Sullivan didn\u2019t believe in that side of things, he wanted to give me the money for the players but sometimes even a thing like getting the pitch right for the guys is what matters. I was into every aspect of the whole situation.\u201d McLeish\u2019s first match of this second stint is a Hampden Park friendly against Costa Rica next month. \u201cIt feels a bit surreal but I believe I\u2019m the guy for the job,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
