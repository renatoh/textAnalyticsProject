Rangers' attempt to retain the SPL title foundered at Parkhead on Saturday, where Celtic won 3-0 to open an 11-point gap at the top of the table. The head of the fans' group, John MacMillan refused to condemn Rangers manager Alex McLeish for performances this season, but criticised him for some of his purchases. \"McLeish must take a share of the responsibility - but for people to be calling for his head is totally unfair and unjustified,\" said MacMillan. \"McLeish has got to answer for some of the summer signings he made. I don't want to single out any player in particular because there is more than one needing to be replaced. \"The players have to look at themselves. I would never accuse a player of not trying, but I would say there was a lack of commitment and that is inexcusable. \"You should show commitment against Celtic, Real Madrid or anyone. There is no excuse for a lack of commitment and we have too many players showing a lack of commitment. \"That is different from a lack of trying, but I would question their commitment to the cause. The players have got to look at what they are doing to the fans, the manager, the club and themselves. \"When you look at some of the inept displays, you have to ask what is happening. \"Some players are getting paid lots of money and not producing the goods. In the outside world, people would be sacked if they did not perform.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
