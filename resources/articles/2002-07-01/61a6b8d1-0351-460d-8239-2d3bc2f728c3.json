The case has been highlighted by the monitoring department at Portman Square who look into races that usually have not been sub ject of a stewards' inquiry. They decided that the performance of Lobos, who made most of the running before finishing 11th of 16 to Distinction in a 10-furlong maiden at Newmarket needed to be looked at. Dettori said: \"It is a big shock to me and a potential slur on my record. Everyone must know that this is not in my character. With all the things that are going on in racing right now, I am flabbergasted that I have to go to London to explain myself.\" Jockey Club spokesman John Maxse explained: \"There is a monitoring system which looks into races and can some times resurrect incidents on the racecourse. There are no hard and fast rules, the system is there to act as a safety net.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
