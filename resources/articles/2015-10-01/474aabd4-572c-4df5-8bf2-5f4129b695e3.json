The Vermont senator revealed his proposal during a student town hall meeting at George Mason University in Virginia. Sanders told the attendees that marijuana should be downgraded by being removed from the Drug Enforcement Agency\u2019s Schedule I list of the most dangerous drugs. Sanders called it \u201cabsurd\u201d that marijuana is considered in the same category as heroin. \u201cIn my view the time is long overdue for us to remove the federal prohibition on marijuana,\u201d he said, lamenting that \u201clives have been destroyed\u201d because of a criminal record over marijuana use. \u201cIn my view, states should have the right to regulate marijuana the same way that state and local laws now govern the sale of alcohol and tobacco,\u201d he said. Last year Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, said she wanted to \u201cwait and see\u201d how legalisation goes in Colorado and Washington before making a decision. However, she has also called marijuana a \u201cgateway drug\u201d and said more research is needed into its effects. In 2013 the Justice Department said it would not sue to prevent Colorado and Washington from legalising marijuana, although the department reserved the right to file a lawsuit against the states at a later date. Sanders\u2019 proposal would allow states to regulate marijuana and would remove the threat of federal prosecution. The self-proclaimed Democratic socialist had suggested legalising drugs in the 1970s when he was running for office in Vermont, although he had been quieter on the subject since then. During this month\u2019s Democratic debate Sanders had returned to his liberal position on drugs, however, saying that if he were a Nevada citizen he would vote for pro-marijuana legislation due to come up in the state in 2016. The anti-drug group Smart alternatives to marijuana has previously given Sanders a D-minus on marijuana policy. The Republican candidate Rand Paul, a libertarian who believes marijuana policy should be decided by states rather than the federal government, also received a D-minus. In 2013 a Gallup poll said 58% of Americans believed marijuana should be legalised. Other polls have suggested almost 80% of Americans oppose jail sentences for people caught with small amounts of the drug."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
