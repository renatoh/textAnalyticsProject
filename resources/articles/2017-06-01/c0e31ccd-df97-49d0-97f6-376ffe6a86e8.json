The revelation coincided with the arrest of Reality Leigh Winner, 25, a federal contractor from Augusta, Georgia, who was charged with removing classified material from a government facility and mailing it to a news outlet. The hacking of senior Democrats\u2019 email accounts during the campaign has been well chronicled, but vote-counting was thought to have been unaffected, despite concerted Russian efforts to penetrate it. Russian military intelligence carried out a cyber-attack on at least one US voting software supplier and sent spear-phishing emails to more than a hundred local election officials days before the poll, the Intercept reported on Monday. The website, which specialises in national security issues, said the NSA document had been provided to it anonymously and independently authenticated. \u201cThe report, dated May 5, 2017, is the most detailed US government account of Russian interference in the election that has yet come to light,\u201d it continued. On Monday afternoon, the justice department said Winner had been arrested by the FBI at her home on Saturday and appeared in federal court in Augusta on Monday. She is a contractor with Pluribus International Corporation, assigned to a US government agency facility in Georgia, it added. She has been employed at the facility since on or about 13 February and held a top-secret clearance during that time. Winner\u2019s mother, Billie Winner-Davis, told the Guardian that her daughter was a former linguist in the US air force who spoke Farsi, Pashto and Dari. \u201cI never thought this would be something she would do,\u201d said Winner-Davis. \u201cShe\u2019s expressed to me that she\u2019s not a fan of Trump, but she\u2019s not someone that goes and riots and pickets or stuff.\u201d The NSA report makes clear that, despite recent denials by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, the NSA is convinced that the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) was responsible for interfering in the 2016 presidential election. The document reportedly states: \u201cRussian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate actors \u2026 executed cyber espionage operations against a named U.S. company in August 2016, evidently to obtain information on elections-related software and hardware solutions. \u2026 The actors likely used data obtained from that operation to \u2026 launch a voter registration-themed spear-phishing campaign targeting US local government organizations.\u201d On Tuesday Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin did not see \u201cany evidence to prove this information is true\u201d, adding that Moscow categorically denied \u201cthe possibility\u201d of the Russian government being responsible. The Intercept noted that, although the document does not directly identify the company in question, it contains references to a product made by VR Systems, a Florida-based vendor of electronic voting services and equipment whose products are used in eight states. The Intercept said the NSA requested a number of redactions in its publication of the document and that it agreed to some that were not clearly in the public interest. The intelligence assessment acknowledges that there is still a great deal of uncertainty over how successful the Russian operatives were and does not reach a conclusion about whether it affected the outcome of the election, in which Donald Trump\u2019s victory over Hillary Clinton hinged on three closely contested states. But the suggestion that Russian hackers may gained at least a foothold in electronic voting systems is likely to add even more pressure to special counsel and congressional investigations. The Obama administration maintained that it took preventive measures to successfully guard against breaches of the systems in all 50 states. The former FBI director James Comey is set to testify before the Senate intelligence committee on Thursday regarding Russian meddling in the election. The FBI is handling the investigation into Winner\u2019s alleged breach of national security. In a deposition in support of the Winner\u2019s arrest warrant, the justice department said: \u201cOn or about May 9, Winner printed and improperly removed classified intelligence reporting, which contained classified national defense information from an intelligence community agency, and unlawfully retained it. Approximately a few days later, Winner unlawfully transmitted by mail the intelligence reporting to an online news outlet.\u201d The statement added: \u201cOnce investigative efforts identified Winner as a suspect, the FBI obtained and executed a search warrant at her residence. According to the complaint, Winner agreed to talk with agents during the execution of the warrant. During that conversation, Winner admitted intentionally identifying and printing the classified intelligence reporting at issue despite not having a \u2018need to know\u2019, and with knowledge that the intelligence reporting was classified. \u201cWinner further admitted removing the classified intelligence reporting from her office space, retaining it, and mailing it from Augusta, Georgia, to the news outlet, which she knew was not authorized to receive or possess the documents.\u201d Vivian Siu, director of communications at the Intercept, said: \u201cAs we reported in the story, the NSA document was provided to us anonymously. The Intercept has no knowledge of the identity of the source.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
