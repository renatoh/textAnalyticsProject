Arena Coventry Limited (ACL), comprised jointly of Coventry city council and the Higgs Trust, had been in talks with the club owners, Sisu, regarding the rent and match-day revenue at the ground until ACL ended negotiations on 22 February, having offered a reduction in the annual rent at the stadium from \u00a31.3m to \u00a3400,000. The club's chief executive, Tim Fisher, told the Guardian this week that, unless negotiations restarted, then the Sky Blues would have no choice but to file for administration. ACL has since applied for a case in the high court to be heard before 27 March, having not received any of the stadium rent since April last year. If Coventry go into administration, they face a 10-point deduction from the Football League that would come into effect this season, ending any hope of promotion via the League One play-offs. If the court rules that Coventry are not in a fit state to continue trading, then the club will be placed into administration and the court would appoint an administrator. The club had their bank accounts frozen last month after ACL issued them with third-party debt orders. An ACL statement said: \"The Board of Arena Coventry Limited (ACL) announces that it has made an application to the high court in London to request that it make an administration order against Coventry City Football Club (CCFC). The application relates to CCFC's failure to pay ACL \u00a31.3m in rent that ACL is lawfully owed for CCFC's use of the Ricoh Arena.\" James Powell, a partner at Walker Morris, who will represent ACL, said that, if the court does not decide to place the club in administration, then the only option would be liquidation. \"We've taken a significant amount of due diligence and we would not be taking this action if we weren't satisfied, on the basis of the information we have, that the club isn't anything other than insolvent,\" he said. \"The only other option is liquidation, and liquidation would be a complete disaster for Coventry City Football Club.\" Chris West, director of legal and financial services at Coventry city council and an ACL board member, said: \"This is an ACL decision; it's ACL who are owed the money. I'm confident that the council are fully supportive of the action we've taken.\" Coventry City declined to comment. They appointed their third permanent manager of the season on Friday when Steven Pressley joined from Falkirk and, following a victory over Scunthorpe United and a draw with Colchester United, they are six points off the play-off positions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
