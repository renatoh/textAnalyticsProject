Arriva Trains Northern says it is running 55% of its normal services despite the 24-hour action called by the RMT union as part of a dispute over pay and conditions. The RMT, which represents the conductors, described the claim as \"nonsense\". Stan Herschel, RMT lead organiser for the North East, said: \"There is no way there are 50% of the services running. I would be surprised if there are even 10% running.\" Speaking from York station, where he said there were few trains, Mr Herschel said: \"The support for this action is solid. I think it is irresponsible of the company to claim services are running when they are not. They are misleading the public.\" But a spokeswoman for Arriva Trains Northern said the company was running 55% of services. She added that this figure included rail services replaced with buses. She said the number of trains running was 15% up on the figure for the last strike in the series. The strike, by 670 conductors employed by Arriva Trains Northern, coincides with a 48-hour strike launched yesterday by 300 ticket and retail staff. The conductors' dispute is over a proposed 3% pay rise, which the union argues is unfair because drivers were offered an 18% pay rise and other benefits. Further strikes are also planned for April 5 and 6 and May 3 and 4 by the conductors. Yesterday's strike by station and retail employees, mainly ticket office staff, platform controllers and general supervisors, is over proposed restructuring. The RMT has claimed that Arriva has suffered financially because thousands of commuters did not have to pay for their travel. Meanwhile, there was some relief for train passengers. Strikes by drivers on the ScotRail network, scheduled for the next two weeks, have been suspended while they consider a 14% pay rise, the company announced."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
