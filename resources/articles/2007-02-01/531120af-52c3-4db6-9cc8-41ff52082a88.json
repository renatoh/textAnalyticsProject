The experiment - the first of its kind in the country - has been running for nine weeks at St Mary's Roman Catholic comprehensive in Newcastle, Tyne and Wear. A \"soundscape\" involving ambient music and sounds from nature has been developed, which is played to pupils as they arrive and leave the school, and also at lunchtime. The same sound is also played at the local Metro station where teenagers gather for their ride home. Staff at the 950-pupil school say it has made lunchtime easier, while Metro operator Nexus - which helped fund the scheme - believes it is helping give passengers a calmer journey. The pilot follows successful schemes in which classical music is played at stations in the evening to calm passengers. The sounds were developed by Soars and Co, which describes itself as an \"experience strategy consultancy\". It tested the sounds on the pupils for six weeks, before using responses to surveys to help tailor the music to their taste. The company is now halfway though a second six-week phase using the adapted soundtracks, and introducing some elements the pupils have recorded themselves. Soars' managing director, Brenda Soars, said: \"We've been getting extremely good feedback. When we started playing it in the dining hall, there's been extremely good results. They're not bad kids at all, there's just a little bit of high jinks. Music has an impact on people's emotions. But everyone is different, so you have to delve into what makes them feel good. You can't have heavy metal music or something like that playing - it has to be the right type of thing.\" St Mary's citizenship and advanced skills teacher, Mike Potts, added: \"We have noticed a swifter delivery of lunch and it's great to be involved in a project where the school council and other pupils have been so engaged.\" Several schools in London are now planning to introduce similar schemes after the success of the project at St Mary's. It was first suggested by Nexus after passengers raised concerns about the behaviour of school pupils on Metro trains."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
