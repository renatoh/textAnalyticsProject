SNP leader Alex Salmond has promised a referendum on independence before the next Scottish parliamentary election. On Thursday night the chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, in a speech to the CBI's annual Scottish dinner in Glasgow, declared that going it alone would be bad for Scotland. Earlier this week the \"Quad\" \u2013 the coalition's policymaking quartet of David Cameron, George Osborne, Nick Clegg and Alexander \u2013 agreed on a \"shift in gear\" in Westminster on the independence debate. Both coalition parties are strongly unionist but they took the view that being forceful in their opposition to independence would antagonise Scottish voters and play into Salmond's hands. A government source said: \"Following the Quad meeting on Monday senior government ministers are getting on the front foot in making the case for Scotland's place in the UK. We are determined to take the arguments head on and lay out the benefits for Scotland and the UK of Scotland being in the UK.\" Alexander said it would have been \"catastrophic\" for Scotland to deal with a collapsing banking sector had it not been part of the UK and said that if it had stood alone \"Scotland's deficit would have been one of the largest in Europe\". Declining oil revenues, he said, would increase the number of problems \"just around the corner\" for Scotland. Alexander said that, on the basis of the population, in 2009/2010 Scotland's slice of the national debt would have been around \u00a365bn, without counting the cost of recapitalising RBS and HBOS, \"which dwarfed the entire Scottish budget\". He said: \"Heroic assumptions about oil revenues don't actually help much \u2013 with revenues forecast to fall steadily, a further structural problem for Scotland would be just around the corner.\" He pointed out that nearly two-thirds of Scotland's exports are sent to the rest of the UK. Alexander said that last year firms owned by the rest of the UK employed 20% of all Scottish workers and contributed to about 25% of total turnover. The Liberal Democrats in particular want to re-energise the pro-unionist side of the debate because they have a number of Scottish Westminster Lib Dem MPs. They performed very badly in this year's Scottish elections and last week, while on a tour of Scotland, Clegg was splattered with blue paint by two unhappy former party members. A Lib Dem source said they would be taking a more bullish attitude towards the independence debate. In this year's poor election performance in Scotland \u2013 they now have only five MSPs \u2013 they kept a low profile but their performance in Wales, where they were higher profile, was healthier. The source said: \"If you are just apologetic, it doesn't get you anywhere. So we've decided we will be more vocal.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
