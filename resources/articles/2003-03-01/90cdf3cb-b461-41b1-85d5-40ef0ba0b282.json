In one corner will be executives of the BBC who have borne a barrage of criticism for the deal brokered after Harrison won the Olympic title in Sydney in 2000, a 10-fight agreement guaranteeing him \u00a31m, which expires after what is expected to be another straightforward win tomorrow night when he faces the Balkan heavyweight champion Ratko Draskovic of Serbia at the Wembley Conference Centre. Facing them will be representatives and lawyers for Harrison's promotional company A-Force, who will be more than satisfied with the story so far. Ten fights and, surely, 10 wins against opponents hand-picked by Harrison and the man he appointed as his manager, the former world featherweight champion Colin McMillan, and hardly a bruise picked up along the way. It represents, by any stretch of the imagination, pretty smart business. Precious little is being revealed by either side about negotiations to date, which some suggest is a silence so deafening that there can be only one reason for the lack of information. Namely, that the Beeb is driving a very much harder bargain than the one hastily prepared in the scramble to beat off potential competitors in the wake of Harrison's gold medal-winning performance. \"We are hopeful of another long-term contract, along the same lines as the first,\" said McMillan yesterday. Nothing is more certain than that the document's wording will be very different, if the Beeb's top brass can be persuaded to reach an agreement. Harrison is forever keen to stress that he has been on a learning curve in the ring, but it is also apparent that the BBC has learned much in the time since the corporation came back to boxing as a serious player. A cursory glance at Harrison's progress since his first shambles of a contest against the inept Mike Middleton shows that improvement in the level of opposition has been painstakingly slow. There has been a smattering of American dross added to the record, names dredged from the obscure reaches of United States club shows and strongman contests, alongside reasonable British fighters from the lighter, cruiserweight division who were persuaded to step up for the payday when they had little realistic expectation of matching a giant of a fighter. Initially, Harrison attracted a viewing figure of six million for his BBC1 screened debut. The figures have dwindled a little since, but he remains the most watched boxer on any channel, a fact which angers his most vociferous critics, who say his fights do boxing a disservice. The argument is that contests involving a novice heavyweight should be hidden away on the undercard of more meaningful bouts. Fraudley, Audrey and Ordinary are just three of the disparaging nicknames Harrison has acquired, and you do not have to go far in the sport to find the opinion that he is a charlatan, a man revelling in his celebrity while taking a no-risk, high-reward route through his profession. It is an argument the BBC has heard endlessly, in newspaper columns and among the paying public, but there may now be a realisation that Harrison has reached the point where he has to get real, which should be reflected by the no-nonsense negotiations which can now be expected. In the US it is the television companies HBO and Showtime who have the biggest say on which fights are acceptable for their headline performers. The idea of a fighter such as Harrison being able to pick his own opponents on their shows would be laughable. Similarly, it is inconceivable that there could be piped audience cheering. It actually happened in Harrison's last contest and was a promotional embarrassment. Interestingly, there is support for Harrison from Duff. The now-retired promoter said last night: \"I think Audley is an exceptionally good fighter, but he is boxing in a league which is beneath him. I could grudgingly understand his first two or three fights, but he is over 30 and you don't have time to build a career as he is doing. \"Right now he could be heavyweight champion of Great Britain [a title currently held by Danny Williams]. He has wonderful ability, a good style and a likeable personality. He needs two 10-rounders against decent opponents, then Williams. Let's say he needs a better standard of crap than the crap he's been fighting. \"But if he doesn't step up in class he is in danger of making people hate him. I had that with Bruno, but the difference was that Frank was still a kid. I look at Audley and say he's improved, but not enough. I'm not happy with his progress. What he needs is a hard fight to establish his confidence. The heavyweights are weak now and he has all the attributes to be a champion. Whether or not he can do it, only time will tell, but he has to move forward.\" Duff's is a ringing endorsement for Harrison, who will go into his negotiations restating what he has said repeatedly: \"I am good for boxing and I am on a mission to win the world heavyweight title.\" But the BBC may also look at the wise old bird's words and say: \"We agree, but now is the time to step up in class - and this time we decide what is value for money.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
