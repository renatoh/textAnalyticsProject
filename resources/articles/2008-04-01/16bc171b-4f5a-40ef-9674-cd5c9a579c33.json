He was essentially a company man, with no consuming ambitions, no illusions of grandeur, concerned only to help bring about the highest standards of performance possible. He was born in London but lived in Abergavenny, Gwent, from 1949. Educated first at Llanfair Kilgeddin school and then at Hereford Cathedral school, he was awarded the George Robertson Sinclair scholarship at the latter and studied under Melville Cook. While in Hereford he acted as sub-organist at the cathedral and, even before leaving school, had formed the Hereford St Cecilia Singers, making his first rostrum appearance with them. He went on to study at the Royal College of Music, London, from 1963, where his teachers included Sir Adrian Boult, Richard Austin, John Dykes Bower, James Lockhart and Hubert Dawkes. In 1966 he won the Michael Mudie award for his opera conducting. The following year he joined the music staff of what was then Sadler's Wells Opera, making his conducting debut with them in 1969 with The Magic Flute. In 1974 he was appointed conductor of the London Welsh Festival Chorus, and the next year joined the staff of ENO. As one of the team of resident conductors at St Martin's Lane, it was Noel's responsibility to assist the music director and guest conductors engaged for specific productions, to coach singers in their roles, and to act as go-between among the various departments - music, production, wardrobe and so forth. This was a job for which he might have been made. An ENO regular, the baritone Ashley Holland, describes him as \"a brilliant coach\" who offered \"both encouragement and challenge to get the best out of singers\". The evenings when Noel's name was on the programme as conductor in his own right were always guaranteed to be special. He covered a wide repertoire at Sadler's Wells and ENO, including Monteverdi's Coronation of Poppea, Donizetti's Mary Stuart, Rossini's Count Ory, Bizet's Carmen and The Pearl Fishers, Gounod's Faust, Jan\u00e1cek's The Makropulos Case and Adventures of Mr Broucek, Dvor\u00e1k's Rusalka, Britten's Peter Grimes and Verdi's Il Trovatore, Rigoletto, Sicilian Vespers and La Traviata. However, it was in Puccini, above all, that he excelled. According to Edward Gardner, the current music director of ENO, Noel had a \"completely natural instinct in this repertoire, in terms of line, phrasing and pacing\". He had, also, an unerring ear for balance and an empathy with the singers that gave them complete confidence in performance, knowing that whatever divagations might occur, he would be there to steer the ship back on course. Mozart and Handel were further areas of expertise. In conjunction with Sir Charles Mackerras, he prepared editions of Judas Maccabaeus, Xerxes and Julius Caesar, and conducted both at ENO and elsewhere (the latter at Houston Grand Opera and the Bavarian State Opera, where he appeared on a number of occasions). He conducted Britten's Gloriana at the New York Met in 1984, some memorable performances of Puccini's Tosca for English Touring Opera in 2006, and last year he undertook Delibes' Lakm\u00e9 for Opera Holland Park. Appropriately for a dedicated team player, Noel was also a passionate football supporter. Such was his dedication to West Ham United that he nearly missed an appearance on the rostrum one Saturday night, having been bundled into the back of a police van after a spot of crowd trouble following an away match at St James' Park. In fact he was the gentlest of men, a devout Roman Catholic, generous, warm-hearted and unassuming. Dedicated to music and the company he worked for, he lived alone and never married. The contribution he made to ENO over three decades, and to the performances and careers of countless musicians, is incalculable. \u00b7 Noel Davies, conductor, born January 1 1945; died March 13 2008"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
