Arcoleo is only 23, but he sounds as if he has covered a lot of mileage. Tenorists Sonny Rollins and Joe Henderson are among his models, but for much of this fine album he deploys something of Wayne Shorter's hypnotic tentativeness, and the melodic style of the Cool School-inspired Mark Turner. Arcoleo's dark, hooting sound edges into softly grooving intros as if he's not sure of his welcome. Then come solos that develop from painterly brushstrokes to searing intensity. His ballad tone is rich and smoky on ruminations such as Glade and Kite Flight. The title track has a patient symmetry that becomes an abstract multiphonic rawness, confirming his composing strengths and technical breadth. Bassist Calum Gourlay, drummer James Maddren, from Kit Downes' band, and pianist Ivo Neame give this imposing newcomer immaculate support."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
