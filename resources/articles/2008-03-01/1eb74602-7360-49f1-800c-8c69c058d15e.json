There is huge experimentation going on, and we are open for business. We want to deliver music to our customers in any way they want to consume it.\" In an interview with the Register last month, he made the apt observation that Invariably, it's artists and creators who are at the sharp end of this food chain, and they're the ones that will get to the stage that they'll give up and go and do something else - because they have to pay the rent, pay the gas bill and feed themselves, buy shoes, and deal with all the things normal people expect to deal with in life. So people have to realise there's an implication in this. There's been all this play about FairTrade coffee and FairTrade sugar - but what about FairTrade bloody music? So, what would you like us to ask him? And then there's Clay Shirky, whose latest book Here Comes Everybody: the Power of Organising without Organisations looks at the way that group dynamics are changing industries and our expectations of work and play. (There's also a blog.) He cites Wikipedia, Flickr, blogs and flash mobs (used in former Soviet states as a means of protest) as examples of this un-organised organisation. Do you think it's important, or passing? What do you want us to ask him? Pitch in below. And just to remind us of some of that Undertones magic, here's the video: Right, if you watched that through you *have* to leave a question. Deadline: 11am 12.30 Monday for Feargal Sharkey, 1030 Tuesday for Clay Shirky, please!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
