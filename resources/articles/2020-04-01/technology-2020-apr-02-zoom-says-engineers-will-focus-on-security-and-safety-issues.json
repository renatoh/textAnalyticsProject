The move comes as the company battles the damage caused by a string of minor scandals ultimately related to the same scrappy approach that enabled it to capitalise on the wave of global lockdowns in the first place. \u201cWe have fallen short of the community\u2019s \u2013 and our own \u2013 privacy and security expectations,\u201d said Zoom\u2019s founder and CEO, Eric Yuan, in a blogpost on Thursday. \u201cFor that, I am deeply sorry.\u201d Since it began gaining hundreds of thousands of users a day, Zoom has come under increasing scrutiny from privacy campaigners, security researchers, and members of the public, who have found faults in the platform\u2019s programming, policies, and practices. Some stem from the fact that a tool originally designed for enabling corporate communications has been repurposed for a wide range of consumer uses, from strangers meeting up for virtual \u201chappy hours\u201d to children\u2019s book groups and remote sessions of Dungeons and Dragons. But others relate to the company\u2019s approach, modelled on the notorious Facebook maxim \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d, of finding unorthodox solutions to problems, which may not always hold up under closer inspection. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between being able to pivot on top of a solid foundation,\u201d says Vincent Roffers, executive strategy director at branding strategists Superunion, \u201cand the path where they have at some level cut corners a bit,\u201d in terms of the way they\u2019ve created their product. The most public problem facing the company has been the rise of \u201cZoombombings\u201d, when trolls join public video chats to wreak havoc among their members by broadcasting pornography, hurling abuse, or undressing in front of their webcam. Zoombombings are possible because the company\u2019s product is built for use in cases where every caller is part of the same company, or already known to each other, security experts say \u2013 an assumption that no longer fits after weeks in lockdown. \u201cWe now have a much broader set of users who are utilising our product in a myriad of unexpected ways,\u201d Yuan said, \u201cpresenting us with challenges we did not anticipate when the platform was conceived.\u201d Zoombombings can be prevented by changing the app\u2019s settings, Zoom said in late March as the problem was growing. And other tools, such as YouTube or Twitch livestreams, may be more appropriate for some uses, such as a broadcast of an author reading their book. Other problems were more baked into the product, however. In July 2019, before it exploded in popularity, Zoom faced an embarrassing security scandal.A researcher discovered that the company installed some code on Macs alongside its app that meant that even if the app was later uninstalled, a single click on a web link was all it took to reinstall the app and join a new conference call with mic and camera enabled. Zoom initially defended the flaw for more than 90 days, saying it was a feature intended to make it easy for users to join calls. Only when the researcher went public did the company act. Apple later pushed a software update to all Macs that automatically prevented the feature from working. That episode left security researchers suspicious of the company, and when it burst into the public\u2019s consciousness in March, the suspicion returned. In just a couple of weeks, researchers found many more flaws, major and minor, which piled up faster than Zoom could fix them, from a broken promise to provide \u201cend to end encryption\u201d for video calls to bugs that would allow a hacker to gain access to a user\u2019s webcam and microphone. \u201cSo many of Zoom\u2019s poor decisions were about prioritising growth over security,\u201d said the analyst Ben Thompson. \u201cThis crisis, though, more than takes care of growth: it\u2019s up to Zoom to seize the opportunity to prioritise security in a transparent and verifiable way at a time when all of their customers want them to succeed.\u201d That\u2019s what the company is promising now, founder Yuan says. Over the next 90 days, it will conduct a \u201ccomprehensive review with third-party experts\u201d, publish a transparency report, and run penetration tests to find and fix further flaws. Superunion\u2019s Vincent Roffers believes that is the right approach. \u201cThey need to make it right in a way that\u2019s transparent that\u2019s visible. The worst thing they could do is retreat and disappear,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be fine. The thing about branding is, you always have a lot of chances: It\u2019s not about what you do now, it\u2019s about what you do next.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
