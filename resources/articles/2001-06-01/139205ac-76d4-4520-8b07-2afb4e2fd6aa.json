Britain's biggest mortgage lender said the average price of a home rose 1.5% in May, adding \u00a31,384 to its value. This followed an even bigger rise in April and has lifted the annual rate of house price growth to 7.3% - its highest since last September and up dramatically on the start of this year, when it stood at 0.9%. \"The prospects for the housing market remain positive with prices set to continue rising over the remainder of 2001,\" said the Halifax. A typical property now costs \u00a390,707 compared with \u00a384,453 a year ago. Nationwide said last week that prices rose 0.8% in May and predicted they would end the year 7% up. The Halifax has joined other lenders in dismissing recent suggestions from the Cambridge Econometrics think- tank that the property market is heading for collapse in London and the south-east because prices are surging ahead of salaries. The think-tank warned that house prices in these areas had reached un sustainable levels and that a 20% fall is needed to bring them back to their long-term average. \"Low interest rates and national affordability levels that are not stretched will continue to drive demand,\" said a Halifax spokesman. \"The continued fall in unemployment and steady income growth have underpinned buoyant consumer confidence which has also supported housing demand.\" The lender noted that the downturn in the world economy, stock market volatility and the foot and mouth outbreak had had relatively little impact on homebuyer confidence. But it said that slower economic growth was expected to constrain the market and prevent a dramatic acceleration in house price growth. The Council of Mortgage Lenders said the proportion of borrowers \"stretching\" themselves in terms of very high percentage loans or borrowing many times their income was lower than in the late 1980s and early 1990s."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
