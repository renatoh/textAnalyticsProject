Ang Lee's film of what happened when two guys fell in love during the summer of 1963 while tending sheep in homophobic Wyoming was bound to get that label. This is a shame. It detracts from what I take to be a core theme, namely that these men did not expect to fall in love. In Annie Proulx's short story upon which the film is based the suggestion is that they are bewitched by the mountain itself. It is not as if they would have gone to a gay bar looking for a good time if it weren't for the fact that they had to eke out a living on harsh high pastures. Rather, love overwhelms them - like a creeper, slowly but surely. That it was same-sex love is only a detail, though one that serves to underline the way that love steals up on them unawares. They have no understanding of how it works, or why. \"This thing\", \"a hold\", \"I swear...\" - these are the inarticulate words the characters use to refer to the love that is a mystery and a gift. It comes to them out of nowhere, just given. Though, once received, it becomes the given of their lives. Which, ultimately, is what love is like - gay or straight. Why should it be that one person gets under the skin of another? Why is it that one day life is fine lived alone and the next it is unbearable? What is this thing called love? Whatever else it is, it is big business. No sooner does the silver tinsel of Christmas come down than the red hearts of Saint Valentine's Day go up. Perhaps we get the celebration we deserve: for contemporary notions of love are dominated by two strands of thought - the sentimental and the scientific. The sentimental stems from the ideal that fires romantic love. It has a long pedigree, going back at least as far as Aristophanes' myth in Plato's Symposium. Aristophanes said that originally human beings were hermaphrodite wholes. Then, in punishment for hubris, Zeus cut each in two. Thereafter, men and women were condemned to spend their lives looking for their lost halves - erotic desire manifesting the horror of not being whole. If found, the two rejoin in sexual congress: an ecstatic annihilation of their separate selves. The sentimental appropriation of Aristophanes' myth today conveniently forgets its dark undercurrents. Industries that promote February's annual love-fest adopt only the upside. \"There is someone out there for you.\" The \"guess who?\" of the Valentine's card signifies the life-changing potential of the right romantic discovery. The romance seems irresistible (I feel like a cold fish objecting to it) but really this has little to do with love. Mostly, it is about the fear of being lonely and unlovable. Which is why it is eminently marketable and not just deployed on February 14, but used to sell everything from movies to makeovers. The second strand is the scientific. It speaks on the matter of love, as opposed to just sex, on the basis of evolutionary psychology. This is easy to caricature, not least because of those proponents who talk so easily as if love were no more than genetically advantageous appeal. This is manifest, according to which account you read, as child-bearing hips in women or potent seed in men (however you detect that). The reason love lasts, or at least aspires to last, they say, is an evolutionary product of the advantages that its longevity brings to love's issue - namely, gene-bearing offspring. To be fair, some scientists say that love is not adaptive in this crude fashion. It is, perhaps, a complex of emotions that stem from original joint activity that leads to people valuing each other. However, scientists such as the neurobiologist Steven Rose point out that even this line of reasoning is an impoverishment of thought. It reduces love to cost benefit analysis. It turns an economic theory of cooperation into a high status, scientific theory of love. Again, one can understand the appeal of that to the love industries. Love as a science can be used to sell everything from pills to personal ads. Put the sentimental and the scientific together and the modern Saint Valentine's Day is the result. Love is an experience that stands or falls on emotional intensity and sexual performance. The question that presses, then, is how to find a way out of this commercial mawkishness. Vowing not to send a card or buy roses at an inflated price is an option. But perhaps one can steal a page out of the marketeer's handbook, seize the opportunity more positively, and use the day to ask again, what is love? A little philosophy of love offers some hard words but rich suggestions that might help recover something deeper. Let me suggest three of the big hitters: Plato, Nietzsche and Augustine. In Plato's Symposium, at which Aristophanes speaks, Socrates makes a substantial contribution, too. He recounts a conversation he once had with a priestess, Diotima. She told him a story of Love's birth. When Aphrodite was born, the gods held a party. Two of the guests were Poros and Penia. Poros got drunk on nectar and retired to the garden to sleep it off. Penia passed by and, wanting him, slept with him. Love - Eros - was the result. Poros means \"way\" in Greek, as in a means or a resource. He is also the son of Metis, which means \"cunning\". Penia means \"poverty\" or \"lack\". Love is what happens when lack combines with cunning means. So, the first thing to say about love is that it is the desire to have and to hold. At base, to say I love you, is to say I want you (and hope you want me). This is the ground even of happy and contented relationships. Is it not the periods apart in which the heart grows fonder again? Do not people text, \"I miss you\", because it is synonymous with saying, \"I love you\"? Is it not the fear of losing the beloved, in death or to someone else, that rekindles the flames of love's early passion? Desiring love is a theme also explored by Nietzsche. In what he called the most personal of his books, The Gay Science, he writes of \"the things people call love\". His observation is blunt. Many of the things that people call love are actually its opposite: avarice, the obsession with possession. Think of the ideal of romance, he says - the proverbial sailing off into the sunset, the couple together, alone, forever. And then think again. Is it not the wish for unconditional and sole possession of the beloved? Is it not the demand, in return, that the beloved will exclude the whole world as a source of happiness and enjoyment, and turn only to the lover for the satisfaction of their needs? The same language of possession is reflected in the way people ask whether lust has been consummated: \"Have you had him (or her)?\" they inquire. Avaricious feelings also lie behind the uncomfortable awareness that one's uglier tendencies are exposed by being in love. This cupidity (from the name for the Roman god of love) also reveals its colours in the lover who tires of relationships, perhaps after a few weeks or short months, only to nurture the desire for someone new. Why does this happen? Because once someone has been possessed, \"been had\", that lover's goal has been fulfilled. The novelty wore off, they say; the relationship became dull. It is for the same reason that a relationship that started out as an affair can die, almost overnight, should the illicit liaison lead to a new marriage. Marriage, at least in part, feels like ownership. Some rejoice in that. But if the thing that fired the affair was the impossible desire to own the beloved, then if that ownership is achieved, the desire, by definition, ceases. Augustine issues another warning about love. When he was young he had a great friend, someone who was sweeter to him than all the other joys of life, he said. They belonged to each other; were another self to each other. But then, when still in their teens, his friend became sick. He developed a fever. He lost consciousness. He rallied briefly, but then died. Augustine was distraught. \"My own country became a torment and my own home a grotesque abode of misery,\" he wrote in his Confessions. He could not bear to stay, and left, declaring, \"What madness, to love a man as something more than human!\" Little wonder that later, on the verge of becoming a Christian, he uttered his famous prayer about becoming chaste, but not yet. Giving up his then love must have reopened the wound of his early loss. This is the dark side of love. It is an antidote to the sentimental; it shows the paucity of the scientific. But each of these philosophers is also at pains to describe how happiness, joy and fulfillment flies over and above this potential for fear, rage and loss. Plato's family history of Eros has further ramifications for the nature of love. Eros is neither immortal nor mortal but an intermediate. He stands between gods and humans, conveying messages and gifts. What this suggests is that, at its best, love aspires to the higher things that humans desire. Things that are beautiful, good and true are what Diotima has in mind in the Symposium. One of the most common ways in which this happens is in the parenting of children. Love is the beautiful thing that the parents share and when they come together, with seriousness and deliberation, they give birth to a great good - a child. In this procreativity the love of the parents becomes almost divine, and their love, through the generations, almost immortal. However, children do not always turn out to be as beautiful, good and true as the parents first hoped. They rebel and change; they may not be a possibility at all, or they may die. So if not children, then Diotima's lovers seek a pregnancy of the soul that issues in great works of art, poetry and philosophy. A wise insight, she says, is like a child of the soul that can never be lost. If this sounds slightly out of reach of most mere mortals, then a less highfalutin product of love is identified by Nietzsche. After his diatribe against avarice, he continues, saying that every so often you meet people for whom this mutual possessiveness has become something else - \"a shared higher thirst for an ideal above them. But who knows such love? Who has experienced it?\" he asks. \"Its right name is friendship.\" In other words, lovers who become friends, as all lovers must do if the love is to last, cease looking exclusively towards each other for their fulfilment and happiness, and together seek it in their life around them. The difference is conveyed in an observation made by CS Lewis. Lovers, he wrote, are typically depicted gazing into each other's eyes. Friends, though, are usually portrayed looking straight ahead. For the Christian Augustine, this higher love only finds final satisfaction when it learns to love God. \"Our heart is restless until it rests in you,\" he wrote. Even for the atheist, this comment can have meaning. Remember that God was ultimately unknown and unknowable as far as Augustine was concerned. What he was saying in part is that love is a mystery: the reason why it has such a grip on us is that it expresses the tremendous wonder of our existing at all. \"I am glad that you are alive,\" the lover says because they are glad they are alive, too. This is what Augustine means by saying our hearts are restless for God, not that conversion solves the problem, but that for him God is the best name for the great unknown that love searches out. One might resist taking personal advice from these three. Nietzsche was hardly a happy man. Platonic relationships: well, enough said. And Augustine comes with all that religious baggage. However, that they are challenging is precisely what is needed to cut through the hazy love-fest that is Valentine's Day. What Nietzsche says is that love is not the right to have another, but the joy of knowing another. What Plato might say is be wary of the way love's lack is used to sell to you, and be encouraged to turn it to things other than yourself. And from Augustine, one learns that, regardless of belief or not in God, there is something about love that is irreducible. The attempt to love, not its explication or even satisfaction, is what makes for life. \u00b7 Mark Vernon is the author of The Philosophy of Friendship, published by Palgrave Macmillan at RRP \u00a320.
