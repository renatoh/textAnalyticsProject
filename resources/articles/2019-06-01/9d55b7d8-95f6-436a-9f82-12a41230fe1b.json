A goal from midfielder Lindsey Horan put the defending champions on the front foot in just the third minute, and they continued to put pressure on a Swedish team that was supposed to give the Americans trouble. With an extra goal from Tobin Heath, that was later changed to a Swedish own-goal, the USA won 2-0. With the result, the US women\u2019s national team have topped Group F and will face Spain on Monday in Reims, the site of their record-setting 13-0 tournament opener against Thailand. Sweden, dropping down to second in the group, will face Canada in Paris in the last 16. \u201cI\u2019m proud the team showed really well and we got some great goals,\u201d said defender Becky Sauerbrunn. Coming into Thursday\u2019s Group F closer, the narrative was whether the Americans might be better off losing so they could avoid a potential meeting with France in the quarter-final. But the US went full throttle against Sweden, dominating possession and creating constant danger without easing off. Both teams made seven changes from their previous matches, but while the US coach, Jill Ellis, was merely reverting back to what has become the first-choice starting lineup, Swedish manager Peter Gerhardsson was resting some of his go-to starters, such as veteran defender Nilla Fischer and forward Lina Hurtig. Julie Ertz was left out for what US Soccer termed a \u201chip contusion\u201d in a \u201cprecautionary\u201d decision but it sure looked like Ellis was resting one of her most important players. \u201cI\u2019m smiling ear to ear because they had such a great performance with two fantastic goals and everyone that stepped on the pitch was fantastic,\u201d Ertz said after the game. The result wasn\u2019t crucial either way \u2013 both teams were already through to the knockout stage of the tournament \u2013 and neither side said they wanted to avoid a particular team, such as hosts France. But Gerhardsson had clearly left out more crucial players than Ellis had chosen to. \u201cWe had a solid game with the players that we had and now we\u2019re looking forward to Monday\u2019s game and having fresh legs,\u201d said Sweden\u2019s Kosovare Asllani. No matter. The Americans, who have emphasized building confidence and momentum, finished Thursday exactly how they wanted: feeling good and in form. The win may not have exorcised the ghosts of the 2016 Olympics and Sweden\u2019s win there that has haunted the Americans ever since, but at least they can now move on and focus on the rest of the World Cup. There were no new goal celebrations to rile up anti-US fans as with the previous two games \u2013 the USA\u2019s dominance will have to do as a talking point. \u201cWe don\u2019t focus on how other teams view us, but I\u2019d hope if teams are watching us play, they see we are a complete team,\u201d said defender Crystal Dunn. \u201cWe\u2019re not just a high press team. We\u2019re a possession team, we want to move the ball and go for opportunities to catch teams out of their positions. We love to share the ball, and at the end of the day, the team that is going to win is the team that has so many threats and doesn\u2019t rely on one player. People should know we rotate our players, we have a strong 23, and we\u2019re always fresh and ready to go.\u201d Horan put the Americans on the board in under three minutes. On a Megan Rapinoe-taken corner kick, a Samantha Mewis backheel at the near post put the ball into position for Horan\u2019s tap-in. It took Heath just five minutes into the second half to double the USA\u2019s lead. She danced with the ball in front of Swedish defender Jonna Anderson and fired a cross that went off Andersson\u2019s foot and into goal. For the first time in this tournament, the Americans were subject to a lengthy video-assistant referee review, but VAR determined that Carli Lloyd, although in an offside position, wasn\u2019t involved in Heath\u2019s goal. With an aggregate goal total of 18-0, the US set a record for the most goals scored in the group stage of the World Cup. Now, with the round of 16 approaching, the Americans are another step closer to defending their World Cup title."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
