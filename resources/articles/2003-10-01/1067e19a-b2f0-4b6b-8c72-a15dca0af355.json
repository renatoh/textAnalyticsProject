Bjorn, who took an infamous five at the short 16th at Royal St George's this year to lose the Open, is as a European Ryder Cup player and Wentworth Estate resident the next best thing to a British or Irish interest, and Bjorn embraced his favouritism enthusiastically. Three down to Len Mattiace at lunch, he won six of the next nine holes for a 4 &amp; 3 victory. \"I got some help from Len,\" said Bjorn and indeed the American was six over par after lunch, equalling the record for the worst afternoon round in the history of the event. Bjorn, in contrast, was two under in difficult, windy conditions and he credited his caddy Billy Foster and his sports psychologist Jos Vanstiphout for his transformation. \"The three of us sat down and worked out that I had not been concentrating sufficiently on my own game.\" As soon as he did that, he reversed the match momentum and his reward is a game today against the Masters champion, Mike Weir. It was not quite the \"crucible of humiliation\" that Chip Beck felt he had been put through by Severiano Ballesteros when he lost by 9 &amp; 8 in 1989, but Alex Cejka was suitably chastened after an 8 &amp; 7 defeat by Vijay Singh - a salutary reminder that good little 'uns rarely beat good big 'uns. Cejka looked a promising player when he first came to notice in 1995, when he won three tournaments including the Volvo Masters. But a propensity for enjoying himself began to get in the way and only recently has he adopted the more monastic lifestyle to which professional golfers these days adhere. He took the decision to play in America, finishing second at the qualifying school and graduating to the US Tour, where his application and dedication have earned him $1,182,883 (\u00a3705,000) this season. But Singh, for some reason he does not fully understand, is playing not just the most consistent golf of his life, but also the best. This normally reticent man has said repeatedly over the past six months that he is playing well, that he feels confident of winning and yesterday he went even further. He did not exactly say \"move over Tiger, I'm coming through\", but he did admit that he wants to be world No1. \"That,\" he said, \"is my goal. I feel like my game right now is as strong as it's ever been. I'm hitting the ball further than I've ever done in my life, I'm playing with a lot of energy in my game and if I play like I'm doing right now I'm going to contend for the No1 spot.\" But as Tony Greer, the man who administered the world rankings for years, pointed out: \"It's theoretically possible but Vijay would have to at least beat Tiger every time they played in the same event.\" In fact Singh might be able to achieve this year's goal of moving ahead of Ernie Els to No2, but not this week. The two are due to meet in tomorrow's semi-final but whatever the outcome it will have no effect on their respective positions. This tournament carries a \u00a31,000,000 first prize but, being unofficial, it is not worth a single world ranking point. Second round (today): 7.45 &amp; 12.10 Els v Clark. 8.0 &amp; 12.25 Micheel v Singh. 8.15 &amp; 12.40 Curtis v Campbell. 8.30 &amp; 12.55 Weir v Bjorn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
