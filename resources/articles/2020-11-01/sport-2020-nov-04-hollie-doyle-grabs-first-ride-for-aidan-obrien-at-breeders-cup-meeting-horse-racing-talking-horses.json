Moore was initially booked to ride Order Of Australia in the Bryan Station Stakes for three-year-olds, the third race on the card at Keeneland on Friday, but O\u2019Brien\u2019s colt is set to carry 8st 6lb, which is Moore\u2019s lowest riding weight over the last six months. As a result, the mount has passed to Doyle, a rider who has seized every fresh opportunity with both hands in recent months. She chalked up her first Royal Ascot winner in June, broke her own record for the most winners for a female rider in a year and also rode a double on Champions Day at Ascot last month including her first Group One win on Glen Shiel. Doyle\u2019s only previous experience of an American circuit, however, has come from riding trackwork at Santa Anita. The ride on Order Of Australia, who is drawn nine in a field of 14, will be a useful introduction to the pace and tactics of racing around Keeneland\u2019s tight turf course. Doyle\u2019s main assignment on the day will arrive less than two hours later, when she will confront a tricky draw in stall one for the Juvenile Turf Sprint aboard Archie Watson\u2019s Mighty Gurkha. The outsider of the field at around 25-1, Mighty Gurkha finished well beaten on heavy ground on his most recent outing at Newmarket, but was fifth in the Windsor Castle Stakes at Royal Ascot in June on a quicker surface, more akin to what he can expect to encounter on Friday. Mighty Gurkha is one of three European-trained challengers for the race, alongside Nigel Tinkler\u2019s Ubettabelieveit and O\u2019Brien\u2019s colt Lippizaner. The likely favourite is Golden Pal,a close second behind The Lir Jet in the Norfolk Stakes at Royal Ascot in June. This year\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup meeting will take place without spectators and amid strict procedures to ensure social distancing and prevent the spread of coronavirus. All jockeys must be tested for Covid-19 before being allowed to ride at the meeting, while there are also limits on how many owners can attend to watch their horses run. \u201cEverybody is wearing a mask and everyone is socially distancing,\u201d Adrian Beaumont of the International Racing Bureau said from Keeneland on Wednesday. \u201cThey are allowing up to 10 owners [per horse] and four in a trainers\u2019 group, so there will be people here. The jockeys are all having their tests today, and they\u2019ve all got their own quarters on the day, so the European jockeys won\u2019t mix with the American jockeys. \u201cEvery state has its own place on the day, so there\u2019s a Californian jockeys\u2019 room, a New York jockeys\u2019 room and so on,\u201d Beaumont added. \u201cIt\u2019s a very good atmosphere and we\u2019re all enjoying ourselves, and the weather is much better than it was last time. \u201cThere\u2019s still plenty of European horses here and the great thing is that there are about half-a-dozen jockeys that have never ridden in a Breeders\u2019 Cup, like Hollie Doyle, Rowan Scott [who rides Ubettabelieveit], Jason Hart [who rides Safe Voyage in the Mile] and Tom Eaves [Glass Slippers, Turf Sprint]. It\u2019s a slightly different group this year, but an exciting group.\u201d Thursday\u2019s best bets There\u2019s little doubt about Thursday\u2019s most interesting race as The Big Breakaway (1.30), one of last season\u2019s best novice hurdlers, kicks off a chasing campaign at Newbury that Colin Tizzard hopes will one day lead to a tilt at the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Tizzard could not contain his excitement about The Big Breakaway\u2019s long-term prospects at his pre-Cheltenham open morning earlier this year, and though he could not lay a glove on Envoi Allen on the way to a fourth-place finish in the Ballymore Novice Hurdle in March, he stayed on strongly up the hill and looks every inch a top-class chaser in the making. Third Wind (2.30) also finished fourth at the Festival \u2013 in his case, in the Pertemps Handicap Hurdle Final \u2013 and he has gone well fresh in the past so looks like an interesting contender for the card\u2019s qualifier for the same race in the spring, while Azzerti (3.05) took the handicap chase 12 months ago off a 4lb higher mark and should go close again this time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
