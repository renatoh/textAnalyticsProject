It\u2019s hard to stop staring at the dripping chest hair in his video tweet criticising the toilets at Manly surf lifesaving club, and not because he\u2019s a wet, half-naked man pitching toilet improvements as an election promise in a country where the rivers are dying, the forests are on fire and inequality is at a 70-year high. It\u2019s because only four years ago, this same man was the Australian prime minister. Desperate to retain his blue-ribbon seat of Warringah in the upcoming poll, the 25-year incumbent has been blazing a publicity trail for himself, his dripping tweets and even dribblier op-eds railing against those local portable toilets, demanding a new commuter tunnel, chastising overdevelopment. Expressed sentiment suggests these are things he should have addressed a while ago, had he not otherwise occupied himself with matters he considered more pressing. He spent his past political half-decade trying to prevent marriage equality, pretending climate change didn\u2019t exist and turning Kevin Rudd\u2019s dangerous mistake with refugees into a full-blown human rights disaster. And this is in the wake of his infamous 2014 budget, whose extremist neoliberal cruelties inspired even suburban Australia to fresh dreams of the guillotine. In his historical trajectory of three-word-slogan politics that included \u201cStop the Boats\u201d, \u201cAxe the Tax\u201d and \u201cDitch the Witch\u201d I didn\u2019t see \u201cImprove the Toilets\u201d coming, but Warringah is suddenly a strange new country for us all. An independent female candidate \u2013 female! imagine! \u2013 is a serious threat to a seat once so safe it\u2019s had but two Liberal MPs in the last 50 years. And her danger is that not only does she think marriage equality is no problem, climate change is a massive one and refugees, my lordy, may indeed be human \u2026 but the seat of Warringah now does, too. Warringah registered a 75% vote in favour of marriage equality even as its representative campaigned against it. Tony has clearly been told that \u201call politics is local\u201d and, with a verve only those with the most profound lack of self-awareness can ever muster, there he is, online in the weekend papers, complaining about \u201ctraffic jams\u201d and demanding he be returned to Canberra. Seeing it is like unearthing old photos of a good friend\u2019s unpleasant ex-boyfriend \u2013 the one who was loud and told boorish, sexist jokes, who provoked a chorus of \u201cJesus, what does she see in him?\u201d whenever they departed the room. You smile at those photos, knowing what the grinning fool who\u2019s in them can\u2019t \u2013 your friend is about to dump him and move on. But stare a little longer and nausea builds for travelling backwards. You remember the time he ate that onion. The time he got the name of Canada wrong. Prince Philip\u2019s knighthood. The nutty business about shirtfronting the Russians. Then you remember; this was also the man who rated women candidates for their \u201csex appeal\u201d. Who told young female netball players a little \u201cbody contact\u201d never hurt anyone. Before the 2013 election, Abbott made a campaign pitch to the Big Brother household. \u201cIf you want to know who to vote for, I\u2019m the guy with the not bad-looking daughters,\u201d he said, flanked by the girls all in white. As cut off as that household was from the community are contemporary mores to this past; watch the video now, in horror. Because MeToo has happened. So has marriage equality. An Indigenous treaty bill paving the way for negotiations passed in Victoria. Meanwhile, the old jokes, the nods, the winks, the smiles, the conservative values, the ancient, gendered, historically ignorant assumptions remain inseparable from the Abbott persona whether he\u2019s damp in his Speedos talking toilets or defending a right to not \u201cdilute his ideas\u201d. Oh, Abbott\u2019s made one or two apologies for aspects of his conduct, over time. But never a big one, for himself or his prime ministership. There\u2019s never been change. Not even the Speedo poses look different. He\u2019s denounced the campaign in Warringah against him as one of \u201cnegativity\u201d. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what they\u2019re for,\u201d he said this weekend, \u201cbut by God, they know what they\u2019re against.\u201d Yes, they do, Tony. And it\u2019s enough. For all of them, and us. Against you, it is enough. \u2022 Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
