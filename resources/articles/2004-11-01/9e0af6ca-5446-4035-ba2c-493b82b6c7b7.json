The row over media accreditation has cast further doubt over whether the controversial tour will go ahead. The team, led by Michael Vaughan, delayed their departure on orders from the England and Wales Cricket Board chairman David Morgan. Team spokesman Andrew Walpole admitted that England cricket chiefs had \"not made as much progress\" on resolving the issue as they would have liked. \"Our priority is to get the ban on members of the media lifted as quickly as possible. What I would stress to you is that it is an evolving situation. There is still a lot of talking to be done.\" The team has been told to stay in Johannesburg tonight in a hotel near the airport. They were so close to boarding the flight that their baggage was already on the aircraft and had to be removed. \"Michael Vaughan and the team were told to stay in Johannesburg to allow David [Morgan] and other representatives to continue their discussions with authorities over the issue of media accreditation,\" Walpole told Sky News. The Zimbabwean government refused accreditation to journalists from the BBC, the Sun, Times, Daily Mirror, Daily Telegraph, Sunday Telegraph, Sunday Times and the News of the World. Journalists from Sky have also been excluded. Europe minister Denis MacShane expressed his \"deep concern\" today over the media ban. \"As a former BBC sports journalist and a former president of the National Union of Journalists, I would like to underline my view that this is a reprehensible step,\" said Mr MacShane, who has called a meeting with Zimbabwean authorities. \"The UK has long been an advocate of media freedom in Zimbabwe. This applies as much to sports journalism as any other kind. I will urge the government of Zimbabwe to allow access to all British journalists who have sought access to Zimbabwe to cover this tour.\" The Sports Journalists' Association of Great Britain has said the tour should be called off, echoing the sentiments of BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew. The SJA wrote to the ECB calling for the tour to be cancelled in May after British journalists including the Daily Telegraph's Mihir Bose were kicked out of Zimbabwe. \"The SJA sent both the ECB and the government a letter in May condemning Mihir's deportation and stated then that it had wider implications for journalists intending to go on the tour later in the year. \"The latest events in which 13 journalists have been refused entry visas, have proved us right,\" said the association's chairman Peter Wilson. \"We said then that unless the ECB or the government could 'secure guarantees from the Zimbabwe government that, should England's tour go ahead, similar incidents would not occur... the tour should be cancelled.\" Agnew said the tour should be abandoned \"here and now\". In his BBC Online column, he said the media ban was \"as sound a reason as any to call the tour off\". The tour to Zimbabwe has provoked opposition ever since it was announced because of concern over the human rights record of Robert Mugabe's government. The tour of five one-day matches is due to begin on Friday. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
