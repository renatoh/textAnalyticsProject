Contador said he had run out of energy after forgetting to eat in the excitement of the key stage. Armstrong said he has \"a ton of respect for Alberto\" and that he will sit down with the Spaniard to smooth things over. Armstrong, the seven-times winner of the Tour de France, is competing in the Milan-San Remo one-day classic on Saturday after returning from retirement this year. Contador won the Tour in 2007."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
