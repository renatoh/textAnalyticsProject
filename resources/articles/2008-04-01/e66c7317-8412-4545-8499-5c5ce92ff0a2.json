We are confident that we are on track for successful first delivery of the diplomas in September. Teachers and lecturers are preparing well for the diplomas. The three days of face-to-face training is only the start of an ongoing programme of training. From leaders to teachers to exam officers, all of us involved are working hard to be well prepared for successful delivery. Diplomas are being introduced in phases over four years. This will ensure that we are able to plan carefully and build understanding of the new qualifications among young people and their parents, as well as teachers, lecturers, employers and higher education. The diploma is certainly a stretching qualification, but we also should expect young people to achieve the basics in literacy and numeracy. All learners' achievements will be recognised, and we believe that the diploma will offer new opportunities for young people to realise their potential.

The 14-19 reforms involve a substantial amount of change. We know, through our leadership of the diploma development partnerships for the first five lines, that this change is being well managed. In particular, the commitment shown by employers is very heartening. Over 5,000 have engaged with development partnerships. Employers are working more closely than ever with schools and colleges, and young people taking diplomas will benefit from this. We are working with all involved to ensure that those taking diplomas can expect a rewarding and valuable learning experience. Dinah Caine Skillset Peter Lobban Construction Skills Karen Price e-skills UK John Rogers Skills for Health Phillip Whiteman Semta Claims that diplomas are \"in disarray\" or \"worthless\" distort the true position. In fact Edexcel itself has given strong support to diplomas and we are working with all parties to ensure the effective implementation of this exciting new qualification. The diploma has widespread support from schools, colleges, universities and employers because of its unique blend of applied and theoretical learning. It is precisely because we want to get the diploma right that we staggered the roll-out of diplomas and only schools and colleges that can demonstrate rigorously they meet all our quality controls have been allowed to deliver the diploma. Teachers will be well prepared for diplomas and we set up local consortia not to create complexity but to provide a powerful way of giving young people the widest possible choice to learn what they want to in the way they need to. I'm confident that the first diplomas we deliver from September will be a great success. Jim Knight MP Schools minister As UK chair of the Higher Education Liaison Officers Association, I am concerned by Jerry Jarvis's comments. In my own university I have been working with regional diploma groups and have been impressed by the enthusiasm and commitment of school staff. As with the Curriculum 2000 A-level changes, some may not have a complete view at the start; there has been much better support for diploma development, with real cooperation between higher education, further education, schools and the local Children, Schools and Families service, and extensive support from the Department for Children, Schools and Families.
