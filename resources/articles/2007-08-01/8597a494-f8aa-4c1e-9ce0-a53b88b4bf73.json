A final call on the centre's World Cup prospects will be made at the weekend. Mark Cueto, who has a groin injury, Peter Richards, suffering a back problem, and Tom Rees (hamstring) should resume training on Monday. The wing David Strettle, however, had surgery yesterday to insert a screw into the fifth metatarsal bone of his left foot. He will be out for three months. \"I feel desperately sorry for David as I'm sure he would have made a big contribution to our World Cup campaign,\" said the head coach, Brian Ashton."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
