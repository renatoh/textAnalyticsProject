Look who's in a pickle with the finances", "bodyText": "\u2022 Let's start with what is good. For it is good that, in this time of austerity, the government clamps down on waste and over-expenditure. Good that, as part of this grand scheme, Eric Pickles, secretary of state for communities and local government, works tirelessly, harrying councils about their bin collections, their staff salaries, their municipal publications. Not so good that, according to the public accounts committee, his own Whitehall department overspent the budget allocated to it by the Treasury \"by \u00a355.5m\". Or that the department did not identify the risk of that happening because \"it did not monitor its position against this control total during the year\". Or that \"it exceeded its capital local government departmental expenditure limit by \u00a31.1m\". While applying everyone else's handbrake, he let his own car roll down the hill. \u2022 Labour still fights the perception that the Tories are more adept at matters fiscal, but the fight is unlikely to be as fierce in the true blue flagship of Westminster. \"Lowest council tax in the country,\" the Tory election leaflet says. \"Westminster, \u00a3676. Lambeth, \u00a31,224. Camden \u00a31,320. Labour-held Camden and Lambeth charge residents NEARLY TRIPLE the rate of council tax of Westminster.\" At least Ed Balls can use a calculator. \u2022 They'll miss Paxman dearly at Newsnight. What will they miss? Well, as a reporter for BBC current affairs, he was always one for foreign travel, with Nicaragua his special subject. So when he heard a young producer was off there on a recce, he placed an order for a weaved wall carpet to be bought and brought back. He had ordered one himself but returned without it. The ing\u00e9nue followed instruction, encountering the irritations one might expect, and presented the rug to the great man. Some years later, he asked what had become of it. \"Oh, my dog sleeps on it now,\" said Paxman. \u2022 Five years ago, Paxo was the lucky recipient of the annual Media Society Award with a black tie dinner at a central London hotel. He was nervous at the outset and more so when he saw the list of speakers and films dedicated to him. It included Rory Bremner imitating him on the Newsnight set and Gordon Brown delivering praise through clenched teeth. Both were old enemies. With this in mind, the organisers planned carefully. Paxo, or JP, was brought there virtually handcuffed to a BBC executive and every time he went to the lavatory he was followed to stop him fleeing the building. The seating might have been handled more sensitively. He sat next to his most obvious victim, the flamb\u00e9ed former home secretary Michael Howard. \u2022 An interesting cameo plays out away from the glare in Westminster. Crimson-toned Tory grandee Edward Leigh is up to something. He asks if attorney-general Dominic Grieve \"has given advice to the government on whether the removal of President Yanukovich was in accord with the provisions of Article III ofthe constitution of Ukraine\". Oliver Heald, the solicitor general, bats him away. \"The fact that the law officers may or may not have advised or have been requested to advise on a particular issue, and the content of any advice, is not disclosed outside government,\" he says. It's convention, is the line. And that's sensible. Think of what followed the publication of Lord Goldsmith's advice on the legality of the war in Iraq. Reputations in tatters, years of grief. \u2022 Finally, sentence passes soon on PR king and string-puller extraordinaire Max Clifford, convicted of eight counts of indecent assault. And apparently an era passes with it. For his business will close, and who will pick up the mantle, trading stories to the red tops, making and breaking careers, trading sexual scuttlebutt to the Sunday papers? No one is in a hurry. \"That day is over,\" one seasoned practitioner tells us. \"There's no profit in kiss and tell. None of the papers have got any money. That market is dead.\" There will be scraps available of course, and those without the cushion of commercial clients will chase them, like fresh-faced hustlers chasing territory in The Wire. But the Corleone of PR is gone, and things will never be the same. Twitter: @hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
