Hutchins, Fleming's regular doubles partner, announced this month he has been diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. \"I'm in contact with Ross pretty much every day,\" Fleming said after he and Murray had lost 7-5, 7-5 to Michael Kohlmann, of Germany, and the Finn Jarkko Nieminen. \"To be honest, it's really inspirational how well he's doing,\" Fleming said. \"He started his treatment on the 10th. I know he said his treatment is fine, but he said he's feeling a little bit nauseous. I think he's tired and he's enjoying being at home to rest up. \"We keep in touch by message and stuff so you can't get a real feel for it, but there's nothing but positive, strong feelings from him. He's not begrudging of anyone who's still playing. He's wishing everyone well and everyone wishes him well, too. \"I'm sure he's going to get through it and be back on the court. That's what we all want. You can call it a dream, but it's our ambition to play again. He will obviously get a protected ranking, as they work it out on a three-month average. We want to be playing again, whenever it is.\" Murray, who linked up with Fleming at the last minute, said, \"I spoke to Ross on the morning he was going to his chemo and a bit before that. I haven't spoken to him the last two, three days. It's a pretty shocking thing to happen, especially someone so close. \"My wife's aunt had the same thing last year, stage four, and she made a full recovery \u2013 at the same hospital Ross is receiving his treatment. So I'm sure he'll do the same. It just shows you, you've got to make the most of your days, because you just never know. Take advantage of opportunities and enjoy the life you have because anything can happen.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
