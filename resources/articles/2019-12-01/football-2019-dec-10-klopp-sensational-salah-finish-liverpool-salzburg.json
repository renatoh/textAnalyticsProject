Salah missed a host of excellent chances against Salzburg before scoring an outstanding goal, Liverpool\u2019s second of the night, to follow Steven Gerrard in reaching the 20-goal mark in the Champions League or European Cup. Klopp said the Egypt international\u2019s refusal to lose focus after the misses was a major factor in Liverpool\u2019s highly impressive victory. \u201cThank God I don\u2019t have to [explain the finish], it was for sure the most difficult situation he had tonight,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cHe played really well but didn\u2019t score in the situations we expect him to score, staying on track and making such a decisive but difficult finish says probably much more about him than all the other goals he scored. He stayed concentrated, believed in the next moment and it was a very, very good goal. A sensational finish.\u201d Liverpool qualified top of their group, with Napoli finishing second, and Klopp cited his players\u2019 respect for the Austrian champions as another impressive hallmark of their performance. He added: \u201cI couldn\u2019t have more respect for what Salzburg are doing. I know how people see it, you think about being best in Austria is OK but some people don\u2019t respect that. You see how good they are, how good they were in the first game, how good they were against Napoli. \u201cWe came here as current Champions League winners and I would really love it if my team is so smart that they listen and put a shift in like that. Salzburg were unbelievably strong, especially in the first half, but we were as well and were ready for the fight. We should have scored in the first half and then in the second half, it\u2019s not easy to keep that intensity. We scored the goals and could have scored more, but I have really massive respect for Salzburg.\u201d Jesse Marsch, the Salzburg coach, said his confident team were ultimately undone by Liverpool\u2019s European pedigree. \u201cIn the end they showed their quality,\u201d he said. \u201cSalah\u2019s goal was unbelievable. It was like a heavyweight fight. We punched them but then they punched us twice more.\u201d Dejan Lovren was forced off with an injury in the second half but Klopp claimed it was not serious and hopefully a repeat of the minor problem the defender suffered in the win at Bournemouth on Saturday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
