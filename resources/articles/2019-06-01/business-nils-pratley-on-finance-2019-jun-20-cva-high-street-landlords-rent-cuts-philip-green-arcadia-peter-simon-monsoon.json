Nor, it seems, can Peter Simon, a half-billionaire whose preferred luxury is expensive art. The founder and owner of Monsoon Accessorize would like his landlords to take rent cuts on 135 stores. From Simon\u2019s point of view, there\u2019s no harm in having a go. Nobody doubts that \u201cfundamental changes have taken place in the retail sector,\u201d as the company puts it, and the tune seems to be a winner. Green got his restructuring of Arcadia over the line, albeit at the second attempt, so why shouldn\u2019t Simon expect similar leniency? But how many more of these requests from wealthy individuals are landlords prepared to tolerate? Monsoon paid the Simon family \u00a3116m in dividends between 2008 and 2013, which is surely sufficiently recent for the property owners to expect a large chunk of the cash to come back into the business in tougher times. Nor can Simon be said to be going to extremes himself in his role as owner of Monsoon\u2019s head office. He proposes that Adena Property, an offshore company he owns, will take a 50% cut on the annual \u00a35m rent bill. Why not 100%? Simon, it should be said, it also proposing to lend Monsoon \u00a334m on an interest-free basis and give the landlords a \u00a310m share on future profits. But, pound for pound, this proposal does not look more generous than Arcadia\u2019s. Yet one suspects the landlords will roll over again and try to convince themselves that this CVA will be the last big one. They hold a poor hand, but they\u2019re also playing their cards weakly. If open season for retail CVAs follows, the landlords have themselves to blame. The \u2018equity income\u2019 absurdity It\u2019s a sub-plot in the Neil Woodford saga, but here\u2019s another piece of idiocy. The fallen fund manager\u2019s Equity Income Fund was not an equity income fund. Or, rather, it formally lost that status in April last year. The \u201cequity income\u201d label derives from the Investment Association\u2019s categorisation of funds. To qualify, the trade body says at least 80% of the assets must be in UK equities and the income must meet or exceed the yield on the FT All-share index, a low hurdle and one that only has to be cleared on a three-year view. The Woodford fund failed to match up last year, which, as everybody now knows, was due in large part to the oversized injection of unquoted companies into the portfolio. A few of the quoted companies also cut their dividends, which won\u2019t have helped either. But here\u2019s the absurdity. Even when \u201cincome\u201d status is removed, a fund can still keep the word in its name. Why would it want to do that? The answer is obvious: \u201cincome\u201d is a magic word in retail investment circles and such funds outsell others by about two to one. Almost every big fund management house has an \u201cincome\u201d fund and, as with Woodford, most don\u2019t drop the name when the goods don\u2019t meet the description. \u201cThe fund name and its objectives are the responsibility of the fund manager,\u201d says the Investment Association. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the power to tell them to change the name.\u201d This is ridiculous. The system could almost be designed to fool the unwary. Dixons Carphone undergoes OS update Alex Baldock, chief executive of Dixons Carphone, is too polite. He would be within his rights to say his predecessor, Seb James, agreed one of the worst deals in recent retailing history when he sanctioned Dixons\u2019 merger with Carphone Warehouse five years ago. For former investors in standalone Dixons, the combination has proved disastrous. Carphone is being tortured by its contracts with big mobile phone networks that were signed in the days when punters wanted two-year service deals. Customers have wised-up to the benefits of Sim-only arrangements, meaning Carphone has to discount to meet volume targets it had pledged to Vodafone, EE and so on. The good news, of a sort, is that the legacy contracts have been \u201crenegotiated\u201d. But the thumb screws have not been removed; the setting has merely adjusted from excruciating to severe. There will be \u201cmore pain in the coming year,\u201d conceded Baldock. It is only in the next financial year that the volume commitments start to wind down. The shame is that old Dixons \u2013 TVs, PCs, fridges, freezers \u2013 has survived the growth of Amazon and is prospering, a real achievement. The mobile factor, however, has pushed the share price close to a 10-year low at 118p. At a rough guess, it would be three times higher if the Carphone deal had never happened."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
