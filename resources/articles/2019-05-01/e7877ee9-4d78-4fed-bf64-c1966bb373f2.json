Watching Tuesday\u2019s extraordinary events at Anfield drove Spurs to perform similarly improbable heroics on Wednesday. \u201cWe all watched the first half together over dinner and at that point it was 1-0 at half-time and Barcelona seemed to have weathered the storm and the way Liverpool played in the second half was inspiring,\u201d says the Spurs midfielder Eric Dier. \u201cFrom an English point of view and from the Premier League point of view, [it] was incredible. They showed the beauty of football and the next day I think we did the same.\u201d As the second half got under way in Amsterdam, nothing suggested that a side who had been struggling domestically and were being outplayed by a spry Ajax team were about to mount a comeback. But this was not a night for logic. \u201cI think in a game like that your head doesn\u2019t listen to your body, your heart is carrying you and I think that is what it did to the team,\u201d says Dier. \u201cWe were just so focused on trying to qualify and it was a bit of an emotional rollercoaster, the way we started and getting back into it, being 2-2 for so long and then finally getting the goal at the end. It was an incredible feeling for everyone involved with the club. A special, special moment.\u201d Dier was an unused substitute against Ajax but everyone associated with the club played a role in the drama. The ecstatic celebrations on the pitch and the giddy rendition of Wonderwall in the dressing afterwards spoke of a squad united in their pursuit of a single dream. \u201cI actually put it on,\u201d says Dier of the Oasis track. \u201cI think it was Christian Eriksen who asked me to. It\u2019s a great song that everyone knows the words to, so it\u2019s a good singalong.\u201d Fostering that squad spirit has been one of Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s achievements. The way the manager has ensured that fringe players always knew their importance has paid off, with players such as Lucas Moura making big impacts after spells on the sidelines. Dier, too, has kept pulling in the right direction despite losing his starting place after injuries and illness. \u201cWhen you\u2019re not playing you\u2019re disappointed but there comes a point where you have to put your ego aside and support the team,\u201d he says. \u201cBe a part of something bigger. To reach a Champions League final you need something bigger, you need a togetherness that goes past 11 or 18 players. Everyone\u2019s mindset is to help the team, whatever that might be ... we know the manager is extremely fair. I think he has always shown that to all the players the whole time he\u2019s been here. We trust him 100%. Whatever decisions he has to make, everyone will respect and be together. This is a once\u2011in\u2011a\u2011lifetime opportunity.\u201d Whatever happens in Madrid, Dier reckons Spurs have altered perceptions. By getting out of their Champions League group despite losing the first two matches, by emerging victorious from last-second dramas against Manchester City and Ajax, he says Spurs, under Pochettino, have shown that the bottler tag has expired. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear since the manager has arrived that I don\u2019t think that represents us. Even though people still use it, I think they know they don\u2019t believe in what they\u2019re saying.\u201d In fact, Dier believes the feats of this Spurs team will never be matched by any club in a similar situation, making no signings in the last two transfer windows and playing in a temporary home while their new stadium was built. \u201cWe\u2019ve had many different things to overcome. I think it\u2019s clear that the club is in a completely different phase to the clubs we\u2019re fighting against, so I think we can all be extremely proud of everything we\u2019ve done. And, of course, the work that the manager has done has been incredible, everyone can see that. I don\u2019t think a club under the circumstances that we\u2019ve been in will ever achieve what we have achieved over the last five years.\u201d The biggest achievement may be ahead. But before facing Liverpool in Madrid Spurs host the other main Merseyside team on Sunday. It would take a freakishly heavy defeat by Everton, plus a big win for Arsenal at Burnley, to cause Spurs to fall out of the top four. But Dier has learned to take nothing for granted. \u201cAfter the last week we know anything is possible in football, so the job isn\u2019t done yet.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
