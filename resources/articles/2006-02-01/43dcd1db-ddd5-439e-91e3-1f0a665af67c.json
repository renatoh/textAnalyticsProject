I've been with my partner for a few years. He is loving and supportive, but last year I got involved with someone through work. Mutual attraction led to a friendship of sorts. I was shocked by the intensity of my emotions and thought a caring friendship might evolve. We continued to have some minor physical contact and I remained quite obsessed by the thought of him. I thought he enjoyed my company and wanted a friendship, but I recently found out that he'd been conducting a very long-standing affair with a mutual married friend. Since the news, this 'friend' has tried to cut all ties to me. I am dealing with the shock, guilt, uncertainty about why this all happened and profound hurt that someone I cared for turns out to be someone else entirely. I need to 'move on', but my faith in myself, my marriage, my judgment and in other people is now damaged. What's your advice? First, stop beating yourself up. There are plenty of people out there who'll do that for you, as you've just discovered. Lucky you that it's taken until now to discover that love's path is strewn with shards of broken glass. Then again, if we all emotionally flatlined from birth to the grave, life would be incredibly dull. You've just lived through a little blip on the monitor and hopefully you'll come back from it wiser and dare I say it... less angry? Barely concealed between the lines of your letter is a raging inferno of fury. All your sentences are loaded with your sense of betrayal. Yet if all you were interested in was a 'friendship', why be upset that he's sleeping with someone else? I think you wanted more, but held back out of fear, false modesty and perhaps a degree of self-preservation. I'm afraid moral boundaries about degrees of physical contact are for teenagers, not grown-ups; or American presidents with a curious definition of sexual relations. I'm not quite sure what you were after. There were so many rules attached to what you describe as an affair I'm surprised you didn't have a legal document drawn up. You may have been under the impression that offering only minor physical contact meant your lover would understand that you were a decent woman looking for a proper relationship. A little bit hypocritical, perhaps? Instead of waiting, the bounder went all the way with someone else! When you're not so hurt and angry you might see the humour in your situation. There's always room for self-doubt and the questioning of one's behaviour. I think you're embarrassed, ashamed, hurt and confused. You need to lighten up a bit. You took your 'friend' at face value and believed his sob story about difficult relationships. It's a cliche of an excuse that comes second only to wives who allegedly don't understand their poor innocent husbands. Expecting honesty in an affair is always a mistake, and faintly hypocritical at that. After all, no matter how tame, it is a relationship based on at least one, if not two, deceptions. Portraying both of you as saintly creatures who abstained from going all the way and settled for an 'intense' friendship neither exonerates you nor increases my pity for your predicament. Once you step out of the barn door you're bound to discover that not all the animals on the farm are domesticated. You've met and dallied with a man in dire need of house training. I'm not suggesting that he's some sort of cuddly pet, but just like a dog he obviously struggles with emotionally mature relationships. It's not the end of the world. Think how much worse it would be if he were your partner, not the object of your fantasies. At least back home you've got a loving, supportive man to return to. Instead of seething about your perceived betrayal why not put the whole episode down to research? You've studied the possibilities of an affair and realised it's probably not for you. You don't have the carefree, daredevil attitude and downright selfishness required to put everything you hold dear to ransom for a fling with a virtual stranger. So what if he's doing what you secretly hoped for with somebody else? Stop letting your pride hold you prisoner and use your experience to develop a slightly thicker skin. Then, with a bit of luck you won't find yourself in this situation again. It sounds like you've got a decent partner. I suggest you use your excess energy to solve the issues that sent you looking elsewhere for some form of extracurricular excitement. If it turns out your problems are irreconcilable then stop wasting time and move on. Your rage would be better spent on something worthwhile, like saving the planet! \u00b7 If you have a relationship question for Mariella, email mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
