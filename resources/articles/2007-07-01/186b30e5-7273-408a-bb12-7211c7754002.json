Microsoft stands behind its products and is taking responsibility to repair or replace any Xbox 360 console that experiences the \"three flashing red lights\" error message within three years from time of purchase free of charge, including shipping costs. Microsoft will take a $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion pre-tax charge to earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 for anticipated costs under its current and enhanced Xbox 360 policies. \"The majority of Xbox 360 owners are having a great experience with their console and have from day one. But, this problem has caused frustration for some of our customers and for that, we sincerely apologize,\" said Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft's Entertainment &amp; Devices Division. \"We value our community tremendously and look at this as an investment in our customer base. We look forward to great things to come.\" Customers who paid to repair a three-red-light failure will get their money back. In the US, the Xbox 360 started with a 90-day standard warranty. There's a FAQ and Major Nelson has produced a blogcast with Peter Moore. Microsoft says: \"There is not a single issue that we can point to as being a problem\" but it has changed the design to try to fix it. (Charles Arthur adds: we're also discussing this on the Gamesblog.)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
