On Monday night at the Edinburgh international book festival, Gordon got in on the action as well. Sometimes in return for a chunky fee and sometimes not, the Brown verdict on the global economy has been given from time to time since he left No 10. In politics, however, he has determinedly held his tongue since his defeat \u2013 entering the fray only where moved by a deeply personal rage at the Murdoch empire's treatment of his family. Now the great clunking fist has swung back into combat. Its target: Alex Salmond's dreams of independence. In England, Mr Brown remains too unpopular a figure to be able to do much for any campaign; the longer period of silence required before a Major or Blair reappraisal were conceivable will be unavoidable in his case too. Scotland, however, is another political country. The last prime minister was always more respected there, holding on to every one of its many Labour constituencies, even as he slid to UK-wide defeat. It should not be assumed that an intervention, which was a reminder of Brownian strengths as well as Brownian weaknesses, will be counterproductive. The language was a little leaden and it came with tables of economic data to reinforce the points. But some real ideas sparkled through. The union was painted as the happy marriage of the Scottish values of \"justice and community\" and the English virtues of \"ordered liberty and individualism\", a rather fanciful way to describe the chaotic path to political unity that this island took, although this most bookish of leaders would be perfectly able to provide scholarly justification for it. This high rhetoric came laced with the dash of low politics that seasoned Brown-watchers would expect. Now freed of the burdens of office himself, the former PM has woken up to the damage that Labour's \"insider\" status in Scottish politics has done the party. After the nationalists formed a minority administration in 2007, the Labour opposition ended up carping about popular policies, such as axing prescription charges on technocratic grounds, freeing Mr Salmond to claim to be the authentic voice of Scotland's social democratic mainstream. The first minister also talks about compassion and solidarity as specifically Scottish values. Mr Brown now seeks to snooker him, by adding the twist that these ideals find their concrete expression in an NHS sustained by UK-wide revenues, a welfare safety net which straddles the border and \u2013 inevitably \u2013 the successes of Team GB. If Scotland's No campaign is another Team GB, Mr Brown has the passion as well as the initials to join their fight. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 August 2012.
