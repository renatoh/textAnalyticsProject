Khan will instead challenge the middleweight champion Sa\u00fal \u00c1lvarez in the defining fight of his career. Khan shocked the boxing world this week by announcing he will face \u00c1lvarez for the WBC world middleweight title on 7 May in Las Vegas. The Bolton fighter had been in negotiations with Brook but will instead step up in weight and face a man who has lost only once in his professional career, and that against Floyd Mayweather. Brook, meanwhile, will make the third defence of his IBF welterweight title against Kevin Bizier. Khan\u2019s team had been in negotiations last year with Hearn, Brook\u2019s promoter, regarding a potential \u201cBattle of Britain\u201d between the pair. In January, Hearn wrote in a tweet, since deleted, that Khan had asked for an 80% share of the purse but the 29-year-old claims an original offer of \u00a310m was cut. \u201cI was offered by Eddie Hearn \u00a310m, when I was at a fight in Liverpool. That\u2019s what I stuck to and as soon as I said: \u2018That\u2019s what I want for the fight,\u2019 everyone turned against me and said I was overvaluing myself. He said: \u2018You can make \u00a310m if you take the fight against Kell Brook.\u2019 Coming back to negotiations, they said: \u2018We can\u2019t offer you that much.\u2019 It was nowhere near that number.\u201d In January, Hearn tweeted: \u201cHe [Khan\u2019s lawyer] asked for a \u00a310m guarantee with upside to fight Brook with Kell getting approx \u00a32-2.5m. After I spat my coffee out we said no thanks. Enough of the insults. We will make this easy for you: 60-40 in your favour (Kell is world champ) and you have it.\u201d \u00c1lvarez, known as Canelo, is regarded as the next boxing superstar and the 25-year-old has knocked out 32 of his 48 opponents. The fight, promoted by Oscar De La Hoya\u2019s Golden Boy, is \u00c1lvarez\u2019s first defence of the title he won in November against Miguel Cotto. Khan believes he will have to draw on the underdog spirit of his Athens Olympics breakthrough 12 years ago, stepping up from welterweight to a catch weight of 155lb against \u00c1lvarez, and said he would be calling on those Olympic memories against the Mexican. \u201cObviously Canelo is one of the best fighters in the world, one of the most dangerous fighters in the world that not many people would say yes to fight. That\u2019s the type of guy I am, I\u2019ll fight whoever they put in front of me and whatever makes sense. I think it will bring out the best in me, whenever you go into a fight as an underdog you want to prove people wrong,\u201d said Khan. \u201cThis reminds me of the Olympics when I was 17 and a lot of people said I was going to get beaten up and not get through the first round. I went and proved everybody wrong and just fell short in the final. When Oscar asked me if I wanted to take the fight, I said: \u2018In a heartbeat.\u2019 \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of advantages on my side, I\u2019ve got the speed and I\u2019m going to bring a lot of power. \u201cI\u2019ve got too much pride to go into a fight thinking that someone is going to beat me, or going in to a fight just for the money. I\u2019d never do that, that\u2019s not the type of guy I am. I really believe I can make history.\u201d De La Hoya said: \u201cIt\u2019s taking boxing back to the roots of what it should be, fighting for pride and fighting for history. He [Khan] wants to show that he\u2019s the very best, that\u2019s what boxing was when I was fighting, when Tyson was fighting, when Mohammed Ali was fighting.\u201d The 155lb catchweight is eight pounds heavier than Khan\u2019s weight for his last fight against Chris Algieri in May last year, and if he wins he will be only the fourth Briton to secure the middleweight title. On the challenge of moving up in weight, Khan said: \u201cI think the weight issue is going to add excitement. It is two different size guys and I\u2019ve seen in boxing many times where the smaller guy has come through and won the fight. I\u2019m at my peak now and I\u2019m going to show the world how good Amir Khan is. \u201cI\u2019m going to be at a good weight, I\u2019m working on the strength side. I\u2019m going to be happy and comfortable at the weight. I\u2019m going into the fight with no pressure, not killing myself making the weight. It\u2019s a fight for me to prove myself.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
