The incident occurred on Monday night about an hour before BA flight 263 from Heathrow to Riyadh was due to land in the Saudi capital. Without warning a clearly agitated man started trying to pull the lever on the door at the back of the plane while screaming \u201cI want to get out\u201d in broken English. Another passenger, Ian McNally, quickly spotted what was happening and tried to intervene. Shortly afterwards the 6ft 7in Dean Whyte, who was sitting in a nearby seat in economy, was alerted to the commotion and rushed down the aisle to assist - along with other members of the fighter\u2019s entourage and an air steward. Whyte was able to grab the man in a bearhug and pull him away from the door, while repeatedly telling him: \u201cCalm down, bruv.\u201d At that point half a dozen more air stewards, one carrying handcuffs, rushed down the plane to help. Finally after a few minutes of angry pointing and shouting from the passenger, he calmed down and was brought back to his seat. Whyte was travelling to Saudi Arabia to support his brother, who is fighting on the undercard of the Andy Ruiz Jr v Anthony Joshua heavyweight title fight on Saturday night. Joshua\u2019s mother Yeta Odusanya was also on the plane, along with several members of staff for Matchroom Sport, who are promoting the fight. A clearly shaken McNally later confirmed to the Guardian that he had given a statement to the flight crew, and praised the efforts of Whyte. \u201cI was mightily relieved when I saw him rushing to help,\u201d he added. Another who witnessed the incident but did not want to be named said he was frozen in panic as the incident unfolded. \u201cI thought that was it,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone who intervened were heroes.\u201d Whyte told the Guardian: \u201cIt was like something out of a movie. When I got there he was shouting \u2018I want to get out\u2019 in broken English. I managed to grab him and was preparing to slam him hard if necessary but myself and the steward could see he wasn\u2019t quite right in the head so I held him and tried to calm him down. Eventually it worked.\u201d A British Airways flight attendant confirmed to the Guardian that the incident had been reported to the authorities. \u201cI have never seen anything like that before,\u201d he added. The airline said it was impossible for an aircraft door to open in flight. A spokesperson said: \u201cOur cabin crew cared for a customer who suffered from a panic attack during the flight. We are sorry for any concern this caused our customers.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
