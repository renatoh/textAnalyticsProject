The woman snapped a picture and sent it to a friend, whose reply showed up in big font on the woman\u2019s phone: \u201cOh no, is he Chinese?\u201d Across the aisle from Chou was a man she later learned is Korean American and a woman sitting next to him, also of Asian descent. The woman quickly replied to her friend: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of them. Pray for me.\u201d Chou knows her experience was not an anomaly. Across the US, Chinese Americans, and other Asians, are increasingly living in fear as the coronavirus spreads across the country amid racial prejudice that the outbreak is somehow the fault of China. It is a fear grounded in racism, but also promoted from the White House as Donald Trump \u2013 and his close advisers \u2013 insist on calling it \u201cthe Chinese virus\u201d. \u201cThis is becoming more widespread,\u201d said Chou, an associate professor of sociology at Georgia State University. \u201cMy fear is coughing in public, coughing while Asian, and the reaction other people will have.\u201d The last few weeks has seen a rise in racist incidents and comments directed toward Asian Americans tied to fears of coronavirus. Last week Trump started to refer to Covid-19 as the Chinese virus. \u201cThe United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese virus. We will be stronger than ever before!\u201d read one tweet on 16 March, the first time he referred to the illness as \u201cChinese virus\u201d online. Trump\u2019s use of the phrase sparked a chorus of criticism. Professional basketball player Jeremy Lin told Trump on Twitter that he should be instead supporting vulnerable people, \u201cincluding those that will be affected by the racism you\u2019re empowering\u201d. Author Celeste Ng noted on Twitter that \u201cAsians worldwide are facing actual harassment because of people who insist on calling the illness the Chinese virus\u201d. Trump doubled down on the name at a press conference on Wednesday, insisting that using the term is not racist. \u201cIt comes from China, that\u2019s why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate,\u201d Trump said. Trump has received support from his allies who have defended the president for giving coronavirus a new name. \u201cChina is to blame because the culture where people eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that \u2026 that\u2019s why China has been a source of a lot of these viruses,\u201d John Cornyn, a Republican senator from Texas, told a reporter when asked if the name was inappropriate. Trump\u2019s new name for coronavirus comes after weeks of racist attacks against Asian American seen across the country. An Asian woman in New York City wearing a face mask was assaulted and called \u201cdiseased\u201d in early February by a stranger in a subway station. In Los Angeles, a man directed a racist rant about coronavirus to a fellow passenger, who is Asian. One family in Fresno, California, had their car tagged with the word \u201cFuck Asions \u2026 and coronavirus\u201d. A middle school student in California was told by his teacher to go to the nurse\u2019s office after he coughed, though he told his teacher that he choked on water and was not sick. When he asked his teacher why he didn\u2019t ask non-Asian students to go to the nurse after coughing, he was told to \u201clet it go and move on\u201d. \u201cThe increasing frequency [in incidents] is something we have to take seriously,\u201d said Gregg Orton, national director of the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans (NCAPA). \u201cRacial scapegoating is the exact opposite response we want to see from leaders of our country.\u201d NCAPA led a group of 260 civil rights organizations in sending a call to Congress to denounce anti-Asian racism around coronavirus. The Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus sent a letter to their fellow members of Congress urging them to share verifiable information about the illness given the misconceptions about national origin and the spread of the virus. Asian American history scholars point out there is a long history of anti-Asian discrimination in America that gives precedent to racist attacks against Asian Americans because of coronavirus. \u201cClose from the very beginning, Chinese immigrants were seen as inferior, filthy and diseased,\u201d said Claire Jean Kim, a professor of political science and Asian American studies at the University of California at Irvine. When Chinese immigrants came to America in 1870, they were painted as a threat to the white working class, leading to racist attacks and segregation. Chinatowns were seen as filthy and full of scum. \u201cWhat is being accomplished by using this kind of language?\u201d Kim said. \u201cWe\u2019re being misled about what causes pandemics and how to possibly prevent them or reduce their severity in the future. That\u2019s the kind of conversation that we need to be having.\u201d There is also a history of leaders painting those in an outsider group as diseased, evoking fear and often violence in their followers toward that group of people, said Susan Benesch, a faculty associate at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard. Benesch coined the term \u201cdangerous speech\u201d: rhetoric that is used to turn one group of people violently against another. That Chinese people are unhygienic and unsanitary is a \u201cvery old feature\u201d of dangerous speech against Chinese in America. \u201cIt\u2019s not really hatred that is the most operative emotion regarding [dangerous speech], it\u2019s fear. Fear is what makes people turn violently against another group of people more than hatred,\u201d Benesch said. \u201cThe level of fear is so great around this epidemic.\u201d As the coronavirus and its effects appear to be long-lasting, advocates in the Asian American community emphasize the importance of speaking up and calling out any racist remarks, when the environment is safe. \u201cWe have to acknowledge everyone\u2019s humanity at this time because the virus doesn\u2019t know race or color,\u201d Chou said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
