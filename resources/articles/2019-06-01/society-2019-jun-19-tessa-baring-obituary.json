As trustee and chair of the Baring Foundation, the grantmaking charity, Tessa was responsible for bringing strategic leadership to a pioneering organisation, particularly in the difficult time after the collapse of its funder, Barings Bank, in 1995. Thanks to her, the foundation not only survived that crash, but thrived as a far-sighted and thoughtful organisation and as a catalyst for innovation by others. She supported the creation in 1989 of the Association of Charitable Foundations, which she later chaired, and advocated far greater transparency in grantmaking and endowment building. She served as a charity commissioner in the 1990s, helping to start the long process of reviewing and renewing thinking about charitable purpose. She also contributed to the modernisation of the Charity Commission. She was a founding director of the National Lottery Charities Board, working hard to make sure that the newly created source of funds was relevant, targeted and genuinely transformative. For more than 20 years Tessa was a board member of the children\u2019s charity Barnardo\u2019s, and was its chair from 1987 to 1993. And for 30 years she managed to find time to support St Michael\u2019s Fellowship, a small charity in London and the south-east supporting disadvantaged families. As its trustee, chair and ultimately patron, she ensured it touched the lives of many. Tessa was born in London, the second of four daughters of Diana (nee Wilson) and Maurice Bridgeman. Her father was a civil servant who later became chair of BP. Tessa studied languages and worked in France and Italy, but returned to Britain aged 26 to take a sociology degree at the Polytechnic of Central London (now the University of Westminster). Although the poly offered her a teaching role, she realised her skills would be best used in the voluntary sector. By this time, she had met and in 1960 married Peter Baring, who became chairman of his family bank and with whom she had three sons, Guy, Max and Hugo. They all survive her. Tessa, who was appointed CBE in 1998, was a champion of younger women, and I was only one of many people who benefited from her wisdom, insight and passionate commitment. She was generous with her time, knowledge, and contacts. She was the most persuasive of advocates, but was also such fun, livening up a meeting, making the human connection and reminding us all of why we are really here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
