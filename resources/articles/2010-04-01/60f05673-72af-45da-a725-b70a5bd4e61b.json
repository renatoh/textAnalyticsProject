The Londoner had heard of the naval plan, but had made \"a calculated decision\" to take the ferry regardless. \"It's never going to get in there; it's too shallow,\" he said, gesturing to the Channel port through the window. \"Which of the three is leading on this then? Brown should be paying for all the ferries too. That'd win him a few votes.\" Keith Marley, who had travelled back from Germany in a newly purchased 30-year-old Volkswagen, agreed. \"It could well be a bit of a publicity stunt,\" he said. \"But the government better watch out, because it could backfire and people are going to ask questions about who's paying for it. I mean, is it the taxpayer?\" Perhaps they need not have worried. Phil Boyle, the British consul general in Lille, said the naval rescue was only \"one of a number of options we're considering to help British citizens\". And defence officials said last night that using the navy to bring people home would not be a simple operation, adding that no detailed plan was in place anyway. The tired and financially depleted hordes who descended on the northern French port were also unmoved by the news that Britain was planning a gradual reopening of its airspace today, as they waited to pay \u20ac65 (\u00a357) for a SeaFrance or P&amp;O crossing that would normally have cost far less. Chris Panteli, a business consultant heading home with his wife and three children after their flight from Spain was cancelled, recited all the extra costs rained down on him by the ashes of Eyjafjallajokull: \"\u20ac200 for the hire car. \u20ac140 to get across the border; \u20ac300 to get to a hire car place; \u20ac450 to get to Calais. Now another \u20ac300 for the ferry. I'm almost home,\" he said. \"But I'm broke.\" Around the terminal, as luggage piled up and parents struggled to control young children, most people managed to remain buoyant in the face of chaos. \"I started in Canc\u00fan,\" said Jay Woods, 33, whose transfer flight from Madrid fell victim to the ash cloud. Despite arriving alone in the Spanish capital, he had teamed up with friends via Facebook and hatched a plan to get them home. \"We paid an extortionate amount of money for what was probably the last hire car in Madrid,\" he said. The journey \u2013 split between three \u2013 came to \u20ac1,200. Around the terminal people recounted acts of kindness. The men from Romford had been driven to Calais by \"a Serbian guy\" they had never met before. Samir Pilav and his wife, Zeljka, who have lived in Derby for 16 years, were given a lift from Croatia by a friend. \"He drove us 20 hours without a break,\" said Zeljka. \"Through Slovenia, Austria, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and France.\" The afternoon, however, was not without its tensions, especially when passengers discovered the price of the ferry. \"This is 100% exploitation,\" said Michael Errington, a film producer. \"This is triple what they usually charge. It's a disgrace.\" Hard currency seemed to be the best way to cut through the crisis: a party of Italians left stranded at the end of a skiing holiday near Tromso in Norway was reported to have hired a taxi to drive them home to Milan. The Norwegian daily Aftenposten said the 10 Italians had set off on Sunday in a people carrier supplied by a cab firm in Tromso which also provided them with three drivers to take turns at the wheel. The shortest route to Milan is more than 2,200 miles and runs through five countries apart from Norway and Italy. The Italian news agency Ansa said the taxi company had estimated that, by the time the party reached Milan, the meter could be showing anything from \u20ac14,000. The holiday companies Thomson and First Choice said they were laying on coaches to bring 5,000 customers home from Alicante and Malaga. Hundreds of holidaymakers who made their way to the north coast of Spain in the hope of catching a boat home were rewarded last night with a place on one of a few weekly ferries which cross the Bay of Biscay to the UK. Brittany Ferries' Pont Aven departed Santander at 5.30pm (4.30pm BST) with more than 1,800 people for the 25-hour crossing to Portsmouth. Hundreds had turned up without tickets. Derek Doyle of the UK consulate in Bilbao said: \"Many had been waiting for four or five days and had crossed Spain to get here. They included a family travelling from Peru who came via Madrid and a woman travelling from LA.\" Hopeful passengers continued to trickle into the terminal, even as the ship was leaving port. \"We set off at 6am from M\u00e1laga and had been driving for 12 hours to get here,\" said Dave Brinicombe, from the Lake District, who had been on holiday in Andalucia. \"We've missed today's boat, but we got a place on Wednesday's. We had been due to fly back last Thursday from M\u00e1laga. We had already checked in when the flight was cancelled.\" Some of those languishing in terminals much further from home were beginning to fret about the delays. At least 50 students in Beijing and Hangzhou on a language programme feared they would remain in the Chinese capital for the foreseeable future. Many face missing essay deadlines and exams and are worried about the extra cost. \"It's a government-funded programme so it's meant to include people from all backgrounds,\" said Monica Black, a second year English literature student at York University. \"We just had to pay for flights and visas, but now we are having to pay for accommodation and living costs. A lot of people have already spent to the max.\" \"We're really appreciative of being here; the government has done so much,\" said Danielle Dodds, a second year forensic science student at Northumbria University. \"[But] people are starting to panic.\" In Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport Granville and Angela Harris from Birmingham were told the first Thai Airways flight they could be booked on was on 4 May \u2013 15 days away. \"I just fainted, just from the sheer shock,\" said Angela. \"This has become a nightmare.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
