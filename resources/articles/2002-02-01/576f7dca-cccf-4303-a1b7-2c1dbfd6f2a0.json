Having laboriously examined the frisky proceedings for more than an hour through his very thick spectacles, he announced to a crew of journalists that he had been left 'cold'. So in the wake of Lord Longford's recent death, it seemed right to make a memorial visit to the city which made him a tabloid hero. But don't get overexcited: visits to a string of Copenhagen sex shops, both straight and gay - strictly on your behalf, dear reader - left us cold, too. They were full of rather ageing American magazines and videos, spiced with a few Scandinavian pin-ups, one of whom appeared to be wearing a toupee. Frankly, you can easily find all that malarkey in Camden High Street. Thirty years after Lord Longford's sex tourism, there are much, much better reasons to visit Copenhagen. It is an urbane, sophisticated but informal city with a string of cultural and architectural attractions. It is also a city where design is worshipped with near-reverence, even if all too few Danes are internationally recognised. (Yes, yes, we know that Sandi Toksvig is a regular on Call My Bluff. And with that, m'lud, we rest our case.) Copenhagen is becoming the fashionable Amsterdam for many lesbians and gays; it is not as crowded and has a compelling stylishness somehow now missing from the Dutch city. No one is in the least bit interested in your private life - booking a hotel room for two men or two women won't raise the slightest murmur. At the Scandic Hotel, where I stayed, two women checked in together dressed in identical construction workers' outfits. No one appeared to notice. It makes a refreshing change from the sniffy nosiness of a Hilton receptionist. There is a network of gay bars in the centre of Copenhagen, a sort of old Soho. These range from the old-fashioned - one, Centralhjornet in Kattesundet, opened 76 years ago - to the rinky-dinky haunts of the hard house disco bunny. Like everything else in the city, they are all within easy walking distance and - a relief for British tourists - everyone speaks English. In Heaven, a cafe in the Kompagnistraede, Danish families happily entertained their children on a Saturday afternoon alongside equally relaxed gays and lesbians and a man in a frock. That absence of paranoia about homosexuality, which makes so many northern European countries feel different from Britain, is commonplace. (The cafe's laidback languor also meant waiting 35 minutes for a croque monsieur, but you can't have everything.) But perhaps it's not surprising either in one of the first countries in the world to introduce gay weddings. When I ran into Henrik and Michael in Sebastian, a fashionable restaurant and lounge bar combo, and they told me they were married, they didn't mean it in a 'have a nice photo', Ken Livingstone sort of way. They meant that they enjoyed the same rights to pensions, benefits and inheritance as heterosexuals and had done for the past 10 years. Emblematic of Denmark's relaxed national identity is Queen Margrethe. Almost unbelievably a second cousin of our own Queen, she is utterly unstuffy. When recently criticised for promoting smoking, she held a press conference and very politely declined to apologise. She smoked throughout. She seems to be a pin-up for gay Danes. She pops out shopping whenever she fancies, so you may run into her if your city break involves retail relaxation. Most of the best shops, and those she frequents, are on the Amagertorv. On the day we visited, Prince Joachim was taking coffee in a cafe there too. No one seemed in the least bit excited - another pleasant change from Britain. The Danish royal family lives in a small complex of identical mini-palaces - mini by British standards anyway - around the Amalienborg Palace. The palace, part open to the public, has guardsmen in bearskins outside: a throwback to Denmark's imperial days. But on the day of our visit the guards were rubbing their chilly hands and looking impatiently at their watches. Their changing of the guard was less a macho march than a desultory mince but was worth watching for its comic potential. Visit the Royal Copenhagen Shop for crockery. And the Rud Rasmussens Snedkerier for furniture. A lot of the stuff is beautifully designed - Arne Jacobsen, the man who created the 'Christine Keeler' chair, was Danish. But look carefully: a neatly curved sofa with which I fell in love in one shop window turned out to be made in Norfolk. Cuisine in Copenhagen is typical Scandinavian. That means lots of fish, and smoked fish, and filling 'winter food', but there are stunning contemporary interpretations of it. Service tends to be better in gay-owned premises, proving that the essential attribute of a good waiter - obligingly camp charm - is much the same the world over. The new Kelleren in Studiestraede, full of fashionable Copenhageners and a few foreigners, produced delicately cured suckling pig and beautifully cooked cod with beetroot. A chestnut pie - traditional fare - was superb. At the Sebastian in Hyskenstraede, slightly more traditional restaurant food was remarkably good, too. Book if possible; Danes eat out seriously at weekends. Copenhagen probably has a higher number of museums than any other similar-size city in the world. A Copenhagen Card will entitle you to free museum entry almost everywhere, as well as free public transport. If you are going to visit more than one attraction a day, it pays for itself. They range from the Thorvaldsens Museum in Porthusgade - a remarkable, haunting tribute to the nineteenth-century Danish sculptor - to the National Museum, which is slightly worthy, similar to our British Museum, but displays a huge range of ethnic and international exhibits without the stultifying dullness of so many London museums. But while there are plenty of Vikings and longships on display, I could find not a single horned helmet. It turns out that they are the creation of overenthusiastic storytellers rather than the Danes' rapacious forebears. Most stunning of all are Copenhagen's art museums. The Statens Museum for Kunst on S\u00f8lvgade is an exemplary national gallery, with dramatic new extensions. And just like the V&amp;A, it has an ace caff attached. The Arken Museum of Modern Art, about 15 miles outside Copenhagen, is built like a ship beached upon sand dunes. I felt inspired as it appeared on the horizon. North of the city is the Louisiana, a stunning modern building housing both permanent and temporary exhibitions. Use your Copenhagen Card to travel to them free. Make time if you can for the fascinating Frihedsmuseet, the Museum of Danish Resistance. This is not very big - fittingly, you might think, given that when the Germans occupied Denmark in April 1940, resistance was so muted that there were just 16 casualties. A group of teenage Danes visiting the museum at the same time as we did looked just as shocked. However, later in the war there was heroic opposition to the Nazis. By then 6,000 Aryan Danes had volunteered for the Waffen SS, an enthusiasm so great that a Danish regiment was specially created for them to serve in. In the very centre of Copenhagen is the Tiergarten, the one attraction that 'everyone visits'. It is a bizarre historic combination of funfair and evening stroll. Alive with fairy lights and fireworks on most nights, it was once claimed to be the inspiration for Disneyland. And if you have purchased a Copenhagen Card, then do use it - you won't be paying anything extra - to visit the Tussaud's Museum. It's a quite awful version of the real thing, so bad it's almost good. There seems to be only one size of model for men and all the exhibits appear dressed in cast-offs. Incredibly unlifelike versions of Tony Blair and Nelson Mandela feature alongside an Elton John with the most natural hair we've seen for decades. Unintentionally hilarious.
