The tube is still in limbo. Jo Moore remains on the government's payroll and her public relations skills failed to stop her boss from taking an ill-advised holiday at a moment of crisis. In the midst of all this chaos, you might be forgiven for thinking that Stephen Byers is a political disaster zone. But you would only be half right. While the country's transport system is a mess, there are plenty of people who think the secretary of state has actually made a good fist of the other half of his cabinet brief - local government and the regions. One Labour local government figure recalls a recent meeting held to discuss council funding allocations, at which councillors were expected to complain to the secretary of state about the size of their annual budgets. Instead of a roasting, she claims that Mr Byers won plaudits from the local politicians. The secret of Mr Byers' success is a combination of a hands on approach to local government policy - he had been a high profile councillor for 12 years - and his successful fight to win extra powers and freedoms for councils as part of a white paper released last month. It will not have been easy for the secretary of state to secure even a modest helping of devolution. Many of his cabinet colleagues, including education secretary Estelle Morris, would rather increase their control of council budgets than give it away. The local government secretary nonetheless secured a promise from his fellow ministers that they would rein in their extensive control of council budgets, with further reductions for high performing councils. Mr Byers has also acted to correct some of the main flaws in Labour's local government policy. Advisers to the former local government minister, Hilary Armstrong, have admitted that their tough council inspection regime was designed to deal with the worst councils. It provided little incentive to improve services and few rewards for those who were already top performers. In response to those problems, Mr Byers' white paper promises to give the best councils far more freedom to spend their budgets and set council tax, while giving the worst a tailored package of help to improve their services. It also contains plans to put councils and private sector firms on an equal footing by allowing local government much more freedom to borrow money and sell services. Of course, Mr Byers cannot take full credit for the white paper. Some of the big ideas had been first mooted by Ms Armstrong, and lobbyists focused their white paper efforts equally on the secretary of state and his deputy, Nick Raynsford, the undoubtedly influential local government minister. Nor is the secretary of state universally popular among his public sector constituents. A gaffe over council housing at last year's Labour party conference was seen as evidence that Mr Byers did not yet have a solid command of his brief. The Tories believe his white paper's attempts at devolution do not go far enough. His policy on planning has also proven controversial. Friends of the Earth described plans to let parliament give the go ahead to major developments like airports, mines and power stations as \"a disaster\" for citizens' rights and the environment. County councils are furious about plans to scrap their role in planning. The views of local politicians will probably not help Mr Byers to keep his job if he fails to sort out the country's roads and railways. But at least one observer at the Local Government Association would be sad to see the secretary of state sacked: \"I definitely think local government would be disappointed, and he'd leave a gap that people would miss.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
