A group of Democrats, flanked by family members of gun violence victims, were at times brought to tears during a press conference on Capitol Hill on Thursday following the murder of 49 people in a gay club in Orlando over the weekend, as they inveighed against an epidemic that kills an average of 90 Americans each day and vowed to force Republicans on the record on the issue. \u201cHow on Earth in the face of the largest mass shooting in the history of this nation could the United States Senate ignore it in the week following?\u201d asked Chris Murphy, the Connecticut senator who led a talking filibuster that began Wednesday morning and did not end until the early hours of Thursday. \u201cMy legs are a little bit rubbery, but my heart is strong,\u201d he added. Murphy, along with 39 of his colleagues, took control of the Senate floor during a debate over an unrelated spending bill as lawmakers returned to business in the wake of the terrorist attack in Florida. The issue has been especially personal to Murphy, who emerged as a leading advocate of reducing gun violence after a gunman in his home state of Connecticut killed 20 children and six educators in the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school tragedy. Democrats were able to secure a vote on two proposals \u2013 one to implement universal background checks and another that would bar suspected terrorists on the FBI watch list from purchasing firearms. But the Republicans who control the Senate said they would offer their own competing measures, meaning any vote would likely be split along party lines and thus ultimately fail. The Senate held a similar vote in December following the massacre in San Bernardino, California, when two terrorists gunned down 14 people and wounded 21 more. Then, too, not a single amendment met a 60-vote threshold needed to advance. While there is agreement in both parties that suspected terrorists should not be able to buy guns, Republicans, along with the NRA, have argued that many people are wrongly named on the FBI watch list. Their proposal would enable the FBI to delay individuals on the watch list from buying a gun for 72 hours, during which period they would need to prove to a judge that there was probable cause to bar them from purchasing a firearm. Chuck Schumer, the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, decried this as \u201ca wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a way for them to say they\u2019re doing something when they\u2019re doing nothing,\u201d Schumer said at the press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s a way for them to pay obeisance to the NRA without changing the world as it is.\u201d Texas senator John Cornyn, the author of the Republican alternative to the FBI watch list bill, took issue with Schumer\u2019s characterization, deeming it \u201cincredibly ignorant\u201d. \u201cObserving constitutional rights for American citizens is not a smokescreen,\u201d he told reporters. On background checks, the Democrats\u2019 plan would require them on all gun sales except for loans or gifts between family members. Republicans have instead proposed legislation that would encourage better prosecution of background check violations but not expand the screening process in any way. Cornyn, who is also the Senate majority whip, said votes on the issues would occur on Monday. But even as the Senate showed a willingness to debate the matter, however briefly, Paul Ryan indicated there would be no such action in the House of Representatives. \u201cIs going after the second amendment how you stop terrorism? No,\u201d the House speaker told reporters Thursday morning at his weekly press conference. \u201cLet\u2019s not take our eye off the ball here \u2026 This is a person who was radicalized by Islamic terrorists, so we want to make sure we\u2019re focused on the real issue here, which is terrorism.\u201d Despite the dim prospects of advancing any new solutions, Democrats insisted history was on their side. With a majority of Americans favoring tougher gun laws \u2013 and 90% of the electorate in support of universal background checks \u2013 Democrats said it would be only a matter of time before lawmakers were held accountable at the ballot box for turning a blind eye to the issue. \u201c[To] those who think that things will just get better, well, every hour, every day, it continues \u2026 a march of violence in our country,\u201d said Senator Cory Booker on Thursday, his voice cracking as he spoke. \u201cYour doing nothing invites those tragedies into more Americans\u2019 lives and possibly into your neighborhood, your community, your church, your playground, your school.\u201d At least some rank-and-file Republicans did, however, exhibit a desire to break the stalemate. Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican known to work across the aisle, said she was drafting a bill she viewed as a middle ground on the terror watch list issue. Collins told reporters her proposal would prohibit access to firearms for individuals on a narrower no-fly list, as opposed to the broader terror watch list. Anyone barred from buying a gun would be entitled to take up the matter with an appeals court, the legal fees of which would be reimbursed by the government if the individual won his or her case. Collins said she was in touch with Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, who authored the Democrats\u2019 version of the terror watch list amendment and could prove to be a partner if Monday\u2019s votes do not yield any progress. \u201cOne of my frustrations is, we\u2019ve had votes on both the Democratic proposal and the Republican leadership proposal before,\u201d Collins said, adding that neither approach had succeeded. \u201cSo rather than doing Groundhog Day, I think it\u2019s time for a new approach.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
