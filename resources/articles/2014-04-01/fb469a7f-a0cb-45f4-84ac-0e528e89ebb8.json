The 71-year-old comedian, who is married to the psychologist Pamela Stephenson, described how the phone call telling him he had Parkinson's came only hours after doctors had broken the news of his prostate cancer last September. \"I remember I went through to the bedroom to answer the phone,\" Connolly told the Radio Times. \"Pamela was behind me \u2013 I thought she was gonna catch me. And she sort of held me and I went, 'Oh Jesus'.\" However, Connolly said the double-diagnosis had not dented his good humour. \"Aye, it just happened,\" he said. \"I think they're very closely related, deep despair and laughing. And I wasn't in any pain.\" Describing the moment he was told he had cancer, Connolly added: \"When he said 'First of all, you're not gonna die,' I was shocked. I said, 'Of course I'm not going to fucking die.' It never crossed my mind. It was all very businesslike.\" Connolly, who has five children, underwent successful surgery on his prostate in the US \u2013 which he described simply as \"in and out, done\" \u2013 and was given the all-clear in October. However, it was the discovery that he had Parkinson's \u2013 after a chance encounter with a doctor in a hotel lobby in Australia who told him he was showing symptoms of the incurable degenerative brain disease \u2013 that prompted Connolly to embark on his latest documentary, exploring the taboos around death. In the two-part programme, Billy Connolly's Big Send Off, the comedian and actor visits a convention of funeral directors in Texas, a pet cemetery in San Francisco, a drive-thru funeral parlour in Los Angeles, and finally his favourite cemetery in his hometown of Glasgow. Jo Clinton-Davis, who commissioned the documentary for ITV, said: \"Billy Connolly's a big fan of life; he's effervescent, energised and inspired by it, but he's also genuinely fascinated by the way we as humans treat death \u2013 a subject that is quite literally the ultimate universal experience, yet so often avoided.\" Connolly says he has incorporated his Parkinson's symptoms into his stand-up shows. Holding up his left hand, he told the Radio Times: \"We were laughing about it because when the strain gets big, this hand starts to shake. And I'm like 'look, look, look, look'. And I do it on stage \u2013 I show the audience this hand creeps up on me.\" In an interview last month, Connolly revealed he stopped taking his medication for Parkinson's. \"It's a weird medicine,\" he told a US chat show. \"Doctors took me off \u2026 they reckon the side effects were stronger than the effects.\" Connolly told the Radio Times it was \"early days\" and he would go back on the medication \"when the symptoms come back\". The documentary, which will air on Wednesday on ITV, will also see Connolly candidly discuss his own thoughts on death. \"I don't think I want a resting place,\" he said. \"I want to be scattered on the wind.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
