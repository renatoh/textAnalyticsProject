A progressive Quaker belief in social justice meant that although they couldn\u2019t actually afford it, Margaret, the previous owner, decided she liked Jude and her husband and reduced the price. \u201cMargaret said: \u2018I want you to have it.\u2019 We were young, I was heavily pregnant at the time and had a toddler, she was kind and lovely and we just loved the vibe\u2026 I\u2019ve never met a bad Quaker,\u201d says Jude. A visual artist and an illustrator of children\u2019s books, Jude has an obsession with the natural world that spills off the pages of her books and on to the walls of her home. They are decorated with her hand-drawn murals of trees, their leaves made from old newspapers. Garlands of hops and ivy are draped over shelves and mantles; branches, some abundant with berries or russet leaves, some bare, are dragged home after walks in the valley with Hector, their cocker spaniel, then hung by string on hooks on the backs of doors, or stuffed into vases. Jude is a collector of life and of what she finds in the fields. A sheep\u2019s skull, an abandoned bird\u2019s nest, furled ferns, seed heads, pebbles, flowers, moss and feathers are all displayed without restraint for all to admire. She is like a magpie of the foraged world, her childlike treasures evoking a nature table in primary school. \u201cI like things to be humble. I like simplicity \u2013 I find that aesthetic more interesting,\u201d explains Jude, who studied visual communication at Bath Academy. Its alumni include Howard Hodgkin and her contemporary, the children\u2019s illustrator Axel Scheffler of Gruffalo fame. Her appreciation of simplicity is laid bare at home. The backdrop for her finds are walls painted in a natural palette of greens and blacks, creating a muted space with little light. In fact, light is not really welcomed at the Wisdom home and, walking into the hall, its absence is striking. Wooden shutters are kept closed, candles are lit, and a matt version of Farrow &amp; Ball\u2019s dark lead grey Down Pipe is on the walls in the sitting room and sweeps up the staircase and on to the landing. \u201cFor me, darkness helps with the creative process,\u201d says Jude. \u201cI like to imagine. If I am internalising, I don\u2019t want to see the outside world; it is too distracting. But I have to admit the house has become more troglodytey with each passing year.\u201d Jude and Luther, a plumber, met at Glastonbury Festival years ago and between them now have three children, all of whom are creative. Jack, the eldest, is a drummer with the jazz-hop band Binbag Wisdom; Daisy, an illustrator, is expecting her first child, and the youngest, Florence, 15, writes poetry, is home-educated, has her own apothecary making tinctures and balms, and loves to knit. Their home, which takes the Bloomsbury group\u2019s Charleston House as a reference point, has organically matured throughout the 25 years the couple has lived here. Each room\u2019s structure has been gradually pared back, revealing floorboards, fireplaces and brickwork. Simple furniture and textiles are well-worn and well-used. \u201cI don\u2019t have a moral issue with buying something beautiful\u201d, says Jude, \u201cbut I just feel happier with found objects.\u201d To this end the family spend weekends browsing markets, skips, pavements and local fairs, all the while cultivating friendships with a variety of flea-market and antique traders, who save old picture frames, metal daybeds and rare picture books for them. This manifesto of found is put into practice in every room. In the kitchen, piles of old French ceramic bowls, vintage 70s saucepans and pots are piled high on a reclaimed scaffolding plank and a flurry of second-hand enamel colanders hang off hooks next to serving spoons and bunches of dried herbs. Upstairs an old crate has a new life as a side table and in the bathroom, balls of moss decorate the soap holder, which they found in a junk shop in Cyprus. A poster of African heads was spotted outside a patisserie in Paris and transported home by the couple, who are always on the look out for found art. Using the natural world to style her home infuses a sense of childhood innocence and inspires Jude\u2019s creativity. \u201cI like the idea of being in a wood, it makes me feel happy. This home is a portal to how I felt as a child. Creating is like going into stealth mode, tapping into that untainted childhood imagination. The best sort of art is child\u2019s art. It is uncontrived with a massive amount of feeling to it. I love that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
