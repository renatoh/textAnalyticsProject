These days I can rarely afford to travel to faraway places, but walking through those narrow, hayfever-inducing hedges (or maize fields) gives me the same thrill of discovery. But I do recall that in Varanasi, the Indian holy city, I once got hopelessly lost in the winding alleyways of the old town. Every time I turned a corner I collided with a slobbering cow, or a gold-wrapped corpse on a stretcher. Theseus's ball of thread would have come in handy. Hampton Court's maze (\"the oldest surviving hedge maze in Britain\") may be a little tame in comparison, but when I was a child, going through it made me feel like a character in an Enid Blyton plot. In my imagination the gloomy, brackenish path became secret passages, musky cellars and hidden traps. With its disorienting twists and turns a maze is a fitting metaphor for day-to-day living. If you want to get spiritual about it, you could even say it's a meditation in movement. To get through a maze, you have to shut out the future and past - it's just one foot after another. I have to admit that I'm navigationally challenged. Once, halfway through Longleat's maize maze - the longest in the world - I lost all sense of direction, and was forced to trot along behind two clever little girls while their plaits bounced up and down, taunting me. But even that didn't dampen my ardour. For the anticipation of nearing the heart of a maze is magical - like dreaming of the first kiss after the chase, the chocolate beneath the wrapping, the itch you can finally scratch. Often the end is nothing but a withered tree stump, but let's face it: hope is what keeps the human spirit alive."}, "isHosted": false}}}
