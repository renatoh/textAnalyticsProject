Quick as a flash \u2013 \u201cTrials and tribulations?\u201d \u2013 he had the entire room laughing knowingly with him. Say what you like about Cipriani but his ascent from a Jersey prison cell back to rugby\u2019s sunlit uplands has been this season\u2019s most colourful tale. A failure because he cannot make the England squad? It recalls the vintage line delivered to a partying George Best in the 1970s \u2013 \u201cTell me, George, where did it all go wrong?\u201d \u2013 by a room-service waiter entering his Park Lane suite. Even the most talented and successful of athletes can be pigeon-holed purely on the basis of reputation and few onlookers have ever associated Cipriani with dull conformity or monastic abstinence. There are other faint echoes of Best: for all his talent the fly-half, now 31, has yet to play at a World Cup. The chances of Eddie Jones picking him for Japan this autumn are widely presumed to be somewhere between slim and none, and Saturday arguably represents his last realistic opportunity. Should Gloucester\u2019s encouraging season extend beyond their crunch semi-final date with Saracens and Cipriani outshine Owen Farrell at Allianz Park, even Jones may have to reconsider. Because, professionally, Cipriani has had the season of his life. His pre-campaign arrest outside a St Helier nightclub last August now feels about as current as the first series of Bergerac and at Gloucester, win or lose, his teammates all swear by him. \u201cDanny has been completely instrumental in how we\u2019ve been playing,\u201d says Ben Morgan, the Cherry and Whites No 8. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone who plays at the line like he does. He\u2019s got a big box of tricks he can pull from and they\u2019re all disguised. He can throw a 30-metre pass or a two-metre pass; you\u2019re about to hit him and you don\u2019t know where that ball\u2019s going. That\u2019s a skill and I don\u2019t think anyone else can do that.\u201d The majority of Cipriani\u2019s peers feel similarly: he has just become the first Englishman in history to be voted simultaneously players\u2019 player of the year and Premiership player of the season. According to Morgan, he has been just as impressive during the week as he has at weekends. \u201cPeople don\u2019t see how particular he is in the training environment; a lot of our strike moves off set pieces have been outstanding. So much credit has to go to him for that.\u201d It remains one of rugby\u2019s irrefutable truths, even so, that one man cannot win \u2013 or lose \u2013 a top-class game alone. Few appreciate better than Cipriani how crucial it is for his teammates to win the gainline collisions or inch forward even half a yard in the scrums. Do that and his box of tricks can be opened. Only if Saracens\u2019 power is neutered will Cipriani \u2013 \u201cIf we match them physically we\u2019ll give ourselves a chance\u201d \u2013 have sufficient ball to weave his influential spells. If Farrell, in contrast, has an armchair ride behind a dominant pack, his opposite number might as well spend his afternoon in Stringfellows. That crucial caveat, of course, will not stop comparisons being made or body language being scrutinised. Both men insist they are fine with one another but the video of Farrell\u2019s initial exasperation when Cipriani kicked to the corner for Jonny May\u2019s winning try in Cape Town last summer spoke of two 10s with differing on-field visions. Cipriani, either way, suggests they may share more than similar tastes in music \u2013 \u201cI think everyone in the squad likes hip hop, from what I remember\u201d \u2013 and a competitive streak. \u201cA lot of sportsmen have a very similar DNA. I get on really well with Owen. He is a very diligent athlete in the way he looks at things; he is meticulous and extremely talented. The timing of his pass and the way he runs a team \u2026 you can see the aura he has.\u201d Farrell, likewise, argues himself and Cipriani both essentially have the same professional objectives. \u201cI don\u2019t know him as well as I know some others but I\u2019ve always been good with him. I worked with him a fair bit on tour and a fair bit in the last World Cup camp. I\u2019ve seen the way he likes to do things and you see a lot of that in Gloucester now. He seems to be getting a lot out of them.\u201d He also retains his teenage memories of Cipriani\u2019s dazzling early years. \u201cDanny was a superstar at a young age, wasn\u2019t he? He could do some electric things. He won the Heineken Cup early with Wasps and you remember some of the tries he was involved in and scored. It\u2019s the same now \u2013 he is quick, gets himself out of tackles, beats people and is exciting. You look at things like that.\u201d What could really hurt Saracens, though, is Cipriani\u2019s passing: as someone wrote recently on Twitter, it is like watching David Gower unfurl a languid cover drive. The beauty also lies in the timing and precision. \u201cFor me, rugby is about making decisions and executing them \u2013 whatever your style or however you look doing it. If you make a series of good decisions, three in a row, it becomes un-defendable.\u201d Which begs the perennial question: could he yet provide England with another attacking dimension? The chances may seem remote but the desire is certainly there. He would, he says, trade in all his awards for a RWC training squad place and a Twickenham final; if an England recall does not materialise he will remain philosophical. \u201cWith my non-selection, people want to find a reason why, but in that moment it might not be what the coach feels. You have to accept that. Eddie speaks to everyone who is in and around the squad and keeps driving me to get better. I am very grateful for that. Hopefully I can go out and execute well this weekend, be involved in the squad and put my best foot forward.\u201d If Gloucester spring an unlikely semi-final surprise, the boy Danny could yet enjoy the last laugh."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
