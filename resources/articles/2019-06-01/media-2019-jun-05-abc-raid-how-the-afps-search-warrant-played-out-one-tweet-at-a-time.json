The warrant related to articles the journalists Dan Oakes and Sam Clark published on 11 July 2017, known as \u201cthe Afghan files\u201d, which included allegations Australian special forces soldiers were under scrutiny for war crimes. The head of the defence force, Angus Campbell, referred the matter to the AFP the following day. In March this year, a former defence lawyer, David McBride, was charged with five counts of leaking classified information which was alleged to have formed the basis of the reports. He has been committed to stand trial. Both Oakes and Clark were named in the warrant, along with the ABC head of news, Gaven Morris. The executive editor of ABC news and head of the ABC\u2019s investigations unit, John Lyons, began live tweeting the raid almost as soon as it began. The ABC was aware AFP officers would be serving a warrant, but only allowed the officers entry under the terms of the warrant. The scope of the warrant \u201cstaggered\u201d Lyons, who said it allowed the AFP to \u201cadd, copy, delete or alter,\u201d material in the ABC\u2019s computers. \u201cAll Australians, please think about that; as of this moment, the AFP has the power to delete material in the ABC\u2019s computers. Australia 2019.\u201d Lyons reported the ABC\u2019s legal counsel advised the officers \u201cwe waive no rights, and reserve [the] right to take [an] injunction against the warrant\u201d. Lyons said AFP officers identified as \u201cdigital forensics\u201d experts formed part of the raid team. Lyons continued to live tweet as the AFP went through more than 9,000 ABC documents."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
