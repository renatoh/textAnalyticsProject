Knowing how Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s Leeds play does not equate to stifling them, and Raphinha\u2019s first goal for the club since his \u00a317m arrival from Rennes delivered another highly impressive away win for the entertainers from Elland Road. The first meeting between Bielsa and Ancelotti was worth the wait. Everton and Leeds traded 38 shots on goal \u2013 23 of them from the visitors \u2013 and while one goal represented a meagre return from an end-to-end, engrossing spectacle there would be no complaints from Bielsa. A third away win of the season was merited reward for Leeds\u2019 enterprise, Raphinha\u2019s potency and Kalvin Phillips\u2019 commanding display. Everton had their chances, too, and two goals disallowed for offside, but lacked a clinical touch and have now taken merely four points from the last 18 available. \u201cWe knew it would be this kind of game,\u201d the Everton manager said. \u201cAnd the team that scored first could always win. They played well. We didn\u2019t play bad but it was not enough to get the result. We needed to be more clinical with the final pass or shot. That was the game.\u201d It was hard to disagree, although Ancelotti missed out the carelessness and defensive errors that crept into his team\u2019s performance late in the game and enabled Raphinha to settle matters in the 79th minute. \u201cHe has all the attributes to adapt quickly to the Premier League,\u201d said Bielsa. \u201cHe is potent, he moves all around the pitch and he can unbalance an opponent from everywhere.\u201d An absorbing game was preceded by a minute\u2019s applause for the late Diego Maradona. His death deeply affected the two managers at Goodison \u2013 Bielsa as a proud compatriot of the Argentinian and Ancelotti as a former opponent turned friend \u2013 and there were tears in the eyes of the former Milan midfielder as applause echoed around the eerily empty stadium. By half-time, the two managers would also share bewilderment at how the contest remained goalless. The game intrigued tactically too. The Everton manager responded to the absence of his first choice full-backs, S\u00e9amus Coleman and Lucas Digne, by deploying the midfielders Tom Davies and Alex Iwobi as makeshift wing-backs. Bielsa attempted to nullify the threat of James Rodr\u00edguez by detailing a man-marking job for Stuart Dallas. Ezgjan Alioski dropped to left-back whenever Dallas followed the Colombian deep into the midfield but Rodr\u00edguez could not be contained entirely and was at the heart of Everton\u2019s brightest moments. Raphinha beat Jordan Pickford with only a minute gone when the Everton keeper hared off his line but Ben Godfrey covered behind to clear the danger. The hosts\u2019 first opportunity fell to Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 when Dominic Calvert-Lewin released Davies down the channel. Doucour\u00e9 met Davies\u2019s low cross at full stretch but his shot was too close to Illan Meslier, who did well to smother and collect as Calvert-Lewin closed in. The attacking intent from both sides was unremitting with the gaps down their respective wings encouraging the end-to-end flow. On another day Jack Harrison would have had a hat-trick by half-time. But not this one. He side-footed wide from Raphinha\u2019s threaded pass with only Pickford to beat, saw another effort cleared off the line by Godfrey and headed Dallas\u2019s deep cross against the post. Pickford also saved well from Raphinha\u2019s header and foiled Bamford at close range after a defensive mix-up between Godfrey and Michael Keane. Rodr\u00edguez conjured a majestic strike out of nothing when Richarlison sent a cross deep into the Leeds area and, for once, Dallas gave his marker a yard of space. First he controlled on his chest on the byline, then cut inside Dallas before clipping the ball over the Leeds goalkeeper at the near post. But the assistant referee, backed up by VAR, spotted Rodr\u00edguez was fractionally offside when the cross was played. The same outcome denied Richarlison when he headed a Rodr\u00edguez corner past Meslier two minutes before the break. Godfrey, standing in an offside position near the goalline, made an attempt to connect with Richarlison\u2019s effort as it sailed in and Everton were thwarted again. The wide-open fun did not halt in the second half, to the visible annoyance of the managers. Richarlison should have done better from Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s lay-off inside the area but sliced wastefully wide. The miss assumed greater significance minutes later when his compatriot collected Phillips\u2019s pass 25 yards from the Everton goal. Godfrey, the recent signing from Norwich, stood off Raphinha too long and the Leeds winger drove a superb finish between the defender\u2019s legs and inside Pickford\u2019s bottom-left corner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
