It is a decision that will take more soul-searching than the one this month, when the Bristolian opted to commit his international future to the red rose rather than the red dragon and promptly found himself named in England's elite squad. Morgan, who will celebrate his 23rd birthday the week after the opening two rounds of the Six Nations next month, is in his third season with the Scarlets. He arrived in Llanelli via Dursley \u2013 the Gloucestershire club he represented for 13 years from the age of five and in the same youth side as his England squad colleague Charlie Sharples \u2013 Cinderford, Merthyr and Cardiff Blues, and this is his first year on a senior contract. The No8 invokes memories in west Wales of Scott Quinnell with his ability to make headway from a standing start and leave in his wake a trail of destruction. Morgan is contracted to the Scarlets until the end of next season. England's policy is to only choose players who are with an Aviva Premiership club, save in exceptional circumstances. Morgan, like Stade Fran\u00e7ais's Tom Palmer, is exempt from that rule because his contract with the Welsh region pre-dated it, but that would change if he stayed in Llanelli beyond the 20012-13 season, and there would be no shortage of interest from English clubs in the powerful and skilful forward. \"My club future is not a focus for me at the moment,\" he says. \"I have more pressing things in the short-term, such as getting into England's match-day squad. The rest will look after itself: decisions right now would not be made with a clear mind, which will not be the case in a year's time. I just want to make an impact in England's training camp later this month and the fact I will be there is down to the Scarlets: people here have been brilliant and I would not be talking about the prospect of playing international rugby but for the opportunities I have been given in Llanelli and the considerable time and effort they have invested in me.\" Morgan, one of eight players in the England squad who are under 23, this month qualified to play for Wales after living in the country for three successive years. He was asked 11 months ago by the then England manager Martin Johnson to make himself available for the Saxons and he was also approached by the reserve team's coach, Stuart Lancaster, who is now the interim head coach of the senior side, but with Wales vocal in their desire to welcome him on board when the time came, he deferred announcing which country he would opt for. \"The Saxons call was a real shock,\" he says. \"I talked it over with my family and friends, but I had so many people telling me what to do or what might be best for me that I had no head space to think for myself. By putting the decision off, it meant that everyone went away and it allowed me to reflect. \"When I had that time, it was an easy decision because I am English: I was born in England, I have always supported England. A country is different to a club. If you are going to take it to the next level, it has to be for the right reasons, particularly as you have to push yourself that much harder. It has to be coming from the heart to start with. \"When England won the World Cup in 2003, I was sitting in my local club in Dursley cheering them on. I could not imagine myself lining up for Wales against England at Twickenham and not singing God Save the Queen. It wouldn't have been right.\" Morgan arrived in Wales by chance. He had left Dursley after one year as a senior to step up a level with Cinderford, but found himself in the second team and when he was recommended by a colleague to Merthyr, he found himself playing sevens in Wales. \"Their head coach, Martin Fowler, offered me my first professional contract and promised me that he would get me in the Cardiff Blues Under-20s,\" says Morgan. \"He was true to his word.\" Morgan played three matches for the Blues, the last against the Scarlets, who were so impressed by his raw potential that he received an invitation from the region's head of development, Gareth Jenkins, the former Wales coach, to join them. When he arrived he was a very big Ben, his 6ft 4in frame supporting nearly 21st but, under the guidance of the Scarlets' fitness coach, Brad Harrington, he has trimmed his weight to 18st 5lb. \"I had never been in an academy system and when it came to diet, I ate what I liked and liked what I ate,\" says Morgan as he tucks into a couple of chicken breasts coated lightly with barbecue sauce. \"It took a lot of hard work to get me into shape and some of the work was gruelling but it has paid off. I am now at my optimum weight for strength, speed and endurance and, again, I have so much to thank the Scarlets for. The style of play here is based on open and expansive rugby, which suits me. I just love getting my hands on the ball, but you also have to be able to adapt when play becomes tight.\" England had been tracking Morgan throughout 2011, when he stood out for the Scarlets at Northampton in the Heineken Cup last October. The return fixture is on Saturday (the referee will be Alain Rolland, his first involvement with a Welsh side since he sent off the Wales captain, Sam Warburton, during the World Cup semi-final against France) when Morgan will face two of his England squad back-row colleagues, Calum Clark and Phil Dowson. But he showed on Boxing Day he was not content to let others do the hard graft when he created his side's only try in a tough win against Ospreys, by breaking off the back of a retreating scrum to batter his way through four defenders and create a hole for Rhys Thomas. \"Northampton will come down here wanting revenge after October,\" he said. \"They have reacted since that defeat and started beating teams heavily. I suppose it is ironic that my first appearance since being named in the squad is against an English club: I thought I would be a long shot for the Six Nations because I was playing in Wales. I do not know many people who have been called up from here.\" Morgan is the first player to be called up by England while playing for the Scarlets or Llanelli, a club that was founded in 1875. He will be released for England's training camp in Leeds later this month, even though the Scarlets are not obliged to do so as it falls outside the official international window: Welsh players based in England are not given that dispensation. He is the only specialist No8 in the England squad, but England have multiple options there. \"It will all come down to how I train,\" he said. \"All the back rowers in the squad are great players and you will have to prove yourself in camp. Nobody is just going to walk into the side. Everyone is very capable otherwise they would not be in the squad. \"We are a young bunch: I do not know what happened in the World Cup, but there is no pressure on us. We can go out and play and make our country proud.\" Morgan will shortly qualify as a plumber. \"There is just a bit of paperwork to sort out,\" he said. \"It is good to have something to fall back on.\" Wales, however, proved a leek too far."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
