McGuire was put to death on 16 January using a combination of the sedative midazolam and morphine derivative hydromorphone. It was the first time that such a cocktail had been used in an execution. Eyewitnesses in the death chamber reported that it took up to 26 minutes for McGuire to die, making it the longest execution in Ohio in modern times. The prisoner was seen to be gasping for air for up to 14 minutes in a procedure that one observer, Lawrence Hummer, described in the Guardian as horrendous and inhumane. In a report written immediately after the execution, known as an \u201cafter-action review\u201d, the warden of the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility where the execution took place, Donald Morgan, writes that \u201cthe process worked very well and the execution was carried out in compliance with\u201d the state\u2019s death penalty protocol. In answer to the routine question, \u201cWere there acts or events that were not anticipated in advance?\u201d he replies: \u201cNo.\u201d A separate review carried out by a special assistant after the execution had been completed found that all the required medical steps set out in the protocol had been properly followed using trained and qualified staff and there had been no variations from established policy. \u201cI find no reason for revision of policy for future executions,\u201d the report concluded. The official recorded timeline of the McGuire execution also made no mention of anything untoward, even though a reporter for the Columbus Dispatch observed that the prisoner had \u201cstruggled, made guttural noises, gasped for air and choked\u201d. The department of corrections stressed that the two reviews were the initial reports into the execution and were narrowly cast to look specifically at whether the requirements of the state\u2019s death penalty protocol had been complied with. A third examination investigating what actually happened during the McGuire execution is already under way though it is not clear when it will be made public. Despite the tight focus of the newly-published reviews, lawyers acting for the deceased prisoner criticized the finding that nothing unanticipated had happened during the execution. \u201cThat is a seriously disturbing conclusion given that we had warned them explicitly in advance, in very strong terms, that Mr McGuire was likely to suffocate to death in a very horrible way,\u201d said Allen Bohnert, McGuire\u2019s attorney. He added: \u201cThey chose to reject our warnings and when everything we predicted came to pass they continue now to claim that nothing unexpected happened.\u201d Earlier this week, Louisiana called off the execution of child killer Christopher Sepulvado who had been set to be injected on Wednesday with the same two-drug cocktail used by Ohio. The state agreed to postpone the controversial procedure to allow a full trial on the constitutionality of the new protocol on 7 April."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
