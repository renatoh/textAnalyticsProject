It also killed 18 people; plunged hundreds of thousands into a dim, candlelit world; brought the rail network to a standstill; blew a Channel ferry ashore; and exacerbated the stock market crash. It was the hardest thump in Albion's solar plexus since 1703. Somebody had to pay. There were several potential scapegoats, but public anger fell, as usual, squarely on the Met Office - specifically, on Michael Fish. Twelve hours before the wind began deforesting the Isle of Wight, Fish uttered the now immortal words on a BBC TV forecast: 'Apparently a woman rang and said she heard that there was a hurricane on the way. Well, if you're watching, don't worry, there isn't.' Oops. As it happens, Fish was royally stitched up. That comment actually referred to a previous news item about Hurricane Floyd, then wreaking havoc in the Caribbean. It did not refer to the approaching storm, in respect of which he actually said: 'Batten down the hatches, there's some really stormy weather on the way.' That bit, however, is never repeated. Yes, the Met Office forecasts did underplay the risk of winds - they believed the 'eye' would track south of Britain - but it was an abnormally difficult storm to predict. In fact, the problems the Met Office had that day, gathering observational data on the tempest as it crossed the Bay of Biscay, highlighted a more fundamental point - in Britain, we have the trickiest weather in the world to forecast. Most of our weather approaches, with the prevailing winds, from the west or south west - ie, over a great expanse of ocean. Thus, it is hard to accurately observe (the inquiry into the storm of '87 stated that the withdrawal of the Met Office weather ship in the Bay of Biscay, because of cost-cutting, was at the root of the cock-up) and it's still developing as it arrives. This is why we can expect any weather at any time. Six inches of snow fell during a cricket match at Buxton in June 1975; hailstones weighing more than cricket balls landed on Horsham, Sussex, in September 1958; in late January 1662, as Samuel Pepys noted, a public fast was held 'to avert God's heavy judgement ... it being neere as warme as at Midsomer'. All the extreme rainfall and flooding events - Lynmouth in 1952, Boscastle in 2004, Hull and Gloucestershire in 2007 - have occurred in summer. The four great storms that are comparable to that of '87 took place in January, October, December and - the one that annihilated the Spanish Armada - August. Few outside the small community of professional meteorologists understand the challenge our forecasters undertake, daily. When they call a big storm and get it right (as they did, for example, in January 1990, when the Burns Day storm clobbered Northern Ireland and Scotland), it goes unacknowledged. When they get it wrong, we carp and moan. The odds have always been stacked against the weathermen. Admiral Robert Fitzroy, Captain of Darwin's HMS Beagle and 'Statist' at the nascent Meteorological Department of the Board of Trade, first conceived the idea of foretelling weather by means of a 'synoptic chart' when another belter of a storm walloped the west coast of Britain in 1859. His first 14-word 'weather forecast' (he coined the term) appeared in the Times in 1861. Fitzroy was ahead of his time. His thinking was right but his forecasts were often wrong - and soon attracted public derision. Sound familiar? The Times dropped them in 1864: 'While disclaiming all credit for the occasional success, we must however demand to be held free of any responsibility for the too common failures which attend these prognostications.' Fitzroy, weary of his critics, abandoned by his friends, and deeply in debt, cut his throat. Thankfully, Michael Fish did not have recourse to such measures. \u00b7 Robert Penn and Antony Woodward are the authors of The Wrong Kind of Snow - The Complete Daily Companion to the British Weather, published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton on 18 October."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
