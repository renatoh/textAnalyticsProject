The legal challenge funded by Sports Direct is being supported by a private Salford-based landlord owned by the family of property investor Aubrey Weis which owns six Debenhams properties. Investment company and major landlord M&amp;G has launched its own separate legal action. The cases are likely to be heard together in early July. Sports Direct\u2019s legal action is the latest move by Ashley in his battle with the department store, which was taken over by a syndicate of banks and hedge funds it owed money. The deal thwarted an attempt by the Sports Direct boss to take control and wiped out the group\u2019s stake in Debenhams which had cost at least \u00a3150m to build up. Sports Direct took part in the CVA vote as the retail group, which also owns the House of Fraser department store chain as well as a string of sports and fashion stores, was owed more than \u00a3500,000 by Debenhams at the time the CVA was tabled. Debenhams plans to close at least 22 of its 166 UK stores in January and force through rent cuts on many others under the restructure. Landlords and other creditors, such as clothing suppliers, approved the closures, which form part of two company voluntary arrangement (CVA) deals that Debenhams\u2019 new owners have said are necessary to prevent the business collapsing. Debenhams received 95% support for one plan and 97% for the other CVA \u2013 an insolvency procedure that only affects certain classes of creditor. Terry Duddy, the Debenhams executive chairman, said: \u201cWe believe the challenges to the CVAs to be without merit and will vigorously defend them. Given the overwhelming support for the proposals from creditors, including over 80% of landlords, this is an unnecessary distraction as we implement our restructuring plans.\u201d Celine UK NewCo 1 Ltd, Debenhams\u2019 new owners, said: \u201cWe note the spurious challenges to Debenhams\u2019 CVA proposals, which were approved by the vast majority of landlords and more than 90% of all creditors. We will move forward with our debt restructuring process as expected. The CVA provides a platform to deliver a turnaround in the business for which the lending group has committed \u00a3200m of new funding and remains supportive.\u201d The basis of Sports Direct\u2019s challenge of the Debenhams CVA is not clear. But in a review of the process published last month, the sports group raised concerns about a sale process run by Debenhams\u2019 new owners which was concluded shortly before the CVA vote. It said the sale process had been run on an \u201cincredibly short and unrealistic\u201d timescale and had closed only hours before the CVA vote. The note also criticised Debenhams\u2019 plan to exit its distribution centre in Sherburn, near Leeds, next year, a move that would leave the company with just one distribution centre serving more than 100 stores."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
