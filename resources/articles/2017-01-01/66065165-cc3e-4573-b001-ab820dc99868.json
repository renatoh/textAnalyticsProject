The Royal College of Emergency Medicine said a substantial number of A&amp;E departments were falling significantly short of the four hour standard \u2013 but Jeremy Hunt said that as many as 30% of those turning up were neither an urgent case nor a genuine emergency. The college, which represents doctors in emergency care, warned: \u201cIn our expert opinion, when an emergency department falls below 75% against the four-hour standard, it shows a significant level of overcrowding and begins to put safety at risk. Present figures suggest a substantial number of departments are falling below this level.\u201d The college believes that one in four A&amp;E units are at risk of offering poor care, citing delays in assessing patients and administering pain relief. In an emergency statement to the Commons prompted by reports of intense pressure at A&amp;E units around the NHS in England, Hunt said that the four-hour waiting time had to be revised to remove non-urgent cases. \u201cThis government is committed to maintaining and delivering that vital four-hour commitment to patients,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cBut since it was announced in 2000 there are nearly 9m more visits to our A&amp;Es, up to 30% of whom NHS England estimate do not need to be there. And the tide is continuing to rise. \u201cSo, if we are to protect our four-hour standard, we need to be clear it is a promise to sort out all urgent health problems within four hours, but not all health problems, however minor.\u201d NHS Providers, which represents hospital bosses, welcomed the change as \u201cpotentially helpful\u201d in relieving the record levels of strain A&amp;Es are experiencing. But Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: \u201cIs he now really telling patients that rather than trying to hit the four-hour target, the government is now rewriting and downgrading it?\u201d The four-hour target, introduced by Labour in 2004, initially obliged hospitals in England to to see and either admit, transfer or discharge 98% of A&amp;E patients within that period. The coalition relaxed that to 95% in 2010 \u2013 but the NHS\u2019s latest figures show that some hospitals are only dealing with 50-60% of A&amp;E arrivals within the supposed maximum four hours. Hunt\u2019s move came as growing numbers of hospitals were forced to declare an alert because they had run out of beds and did not know where to put the large numbers of patients who needed to be admitted. The medical director of Kettering general hospital said the situation at his hospital was serious. Dr Andrew Chiltern texted colleagues at lunchtime on Monday to say: \u201cOn the verge of significant internal incident. Situation is dire. We need to achieve discharges. May need to take action of cancelling all two-week waits tomorrow and outpatient department activity if we can\u2019t get control.\u201d Croydon university hospital in south London said it began looking after adult patients on a ward that is usually reserved for children who have had surgery. It has moved the people it normally cares for there into extra beds it has opened up on one of its children\u2019s wards. It made the temporary switch last week in response to the huge difficulties hospitals are having finding enough beds for patients who are so sick that they need to be admitted for treatment. The health secretary also told MPs that hospitals may have to cancel operations and outpatient appointments so that staff can concentrate on the sickest patients. GPs may also be drafted in to help hospitals cope with record demand for medical care. NHS Providers also voiced its fears that the overload facing A&amp;Es could endanger patients. It said: \u201cPersistently large number of trolley and 12-hour waits is a proxy for significantly elevated risk to patient safety and potential for significant harm. The same applies to persistently large numbers of long ambulance waits [outside an A&amp;E with a patient unable to be handed over to busy hospital staff].\u201d The warning has prompted concern because the three triggers it identifies for patient safety being compromised are all now found fairly regularly at some hospitals. In November, 237 patients waited more than 12 hours to get a bed at the Royal Stoke university hospital, while some ambulance crews were stuck outside hospitals in Merseyside last week for up to eight hours, unable to hand over their patients to A&amp;E staff. A number of trusts \u2013 including Lewisham in London, Mid Essex, Addenbrooke\u2019s in Cambridge and East and North Hertfordshire \u2013 had to declare a red or black alert on Monday because they were so hard-pressed. NHS Providers denied that the NHS was in meltdown and rejected the British Red Cross\u2019s claim that the NHS is experiencing a \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d as an exaggeration. It said that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of trusts were coping, but added that a \u201csmall number of trusts are failing to cope and have seen persistently large trolley and 12-hour waits\u201d and some hospitals have seen the demand for A&amp;E care soar by 20% in a year. While NHS personnel have been working flat-out recently to maintain services, \u201cthis level of staff goodwill is becoming unsustainable\u201d. The Liberal Democrat former health minister Norman Lamb warned that it could lead to some patients being left to wait indefinitely in A&amp;E. \u201cThis is a slippery slope towards the downgrading of standards of care across the NHS,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government cannot just keep moving the goalposts as the health service struggles to cope with rising demand.\u201d Hunt, who spoke hours after Theresa May gave a keynote speech on mental health, said that Tuesday 27 December had been the busiest day in the NHS\u2019s 69-year history. Pressures may intensify further later this week with the arrival of very cold weather, he warned. \u201cWe need to have an honest discussion with the public about the purpose of A&amp;E departments\u201d, he added. However, NHS experts said that inadequate GP and social care services were partly to blame for the relentless rise in A&amp;E attendances."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
