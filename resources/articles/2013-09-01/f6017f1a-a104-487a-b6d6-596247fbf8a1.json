The film for the Cybersmile Foundation, which describes itself as the only dedicated cyberbullying charity, is designed to raise awareness of the growing threat of online bullying. It also tries to impart what the organisation says is a lifesaving message. In it, a girl is shown reading abusive text messages about a song which she has recorded and posted online. As she texts back, a noose is seen slowly descending from the sky. The film, which has been launched with the Twitter hashtag of #DONTRETALIATE, follows the girl over the course of several days as friends and family appear oblivious to her torment. By the end, she is lifted off the ground while sitting at her bedroom desk tapping on her computer keyboard. \"Do not retaliate is the single most important piece of advice that we can give to a potential victim of cyberbullying,\" said Scott Freeman, founder of the Cybersmile Foundation. \"If followed, the advice helps to reduce anxieties and allows for clearer thinking at a time when somebody is making a very real, life or death decision.\" \"During production of #DONTRETALIATE, there were three cyberbullying related suicides in the UK. \"We just hope the film is well supported and reaches the people that need to see it. If this film saves just one life, it has all been worthwhile.\" More than one in three young children have experienced threats online in the UK and one in four say these threats have continued, according to Cybersmile. Cyberbullying has been in the spotlight this year following the death of 14-year-old Hannah Smith, who was found hanged at her home in Lutterworth, Leicestershire, on 2 August. Calls intensified for a website, Ask.fm, to be closed down after it was revealed that Hannah took her life after being cyberbullied on the question-and-answer site. The site subsequently unveiled changes which it said were designed to make it safer.
