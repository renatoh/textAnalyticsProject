The union will consult members among 500,000 school support staff in England, angry that their negotiating body, established last year, appeared earmarked for abolition. This showed \"the utter contempt\" the coalition had for low-paid workers and trade unions, Unison said. The Cabinet Office ordered an investigation into \"irresponsible\" leaks to the BBC and Daily Telegraph, saying it regretted the uncertainty this had caused employees of the bodies named. Bodies proposed for abolition include several whose doubtful future have already caused an outcry,including the proposed axeing of the Film Council and the Audit Commission. The Health Protection Agency and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority were known to be at risk, under government plans to take direct responsibility. The BBC World Service, the British Council, the supreme court (only opened in October last year), the Equality and Human Rights Commission, the Environment Agency, and the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, are among 100 bodies whose future is apparently still in doubt. More than 280 are said to have been spared, because of their independence or technical expertise. The leaked list accompanied a letter from the Cabinet Office minister, Francis Maude, to the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, which was obtained by the BBC. The letter, dated 26 August, says accompanying proposals already mean 49% of bodies face abolition or reform \"and this is likely to rise following final decisions\". It also says the proposals will \"have a significant impact on the public sector landscape\". Departments would be expected to cut staff and cope with winding-up costs within budgets agreed as part of the public spending review. The communities and local government secretary, Eric Pickles, suggested the leaks were \"a bit dated\", telling BBC Radio 4's Today: \"I think things may have moved on.\" The government would make an announcement \"in due course\".Unison claims 200,000 members among school support staff, including teaching assistants and dinner ladies. It wants a formal equality impact assessment on the proposed abolition of the negotiating body. Meanwhile, David Cameron attempted to move the debate on from the cuts. In an interview in today's Daily Telegraph he said: \"You've got to describe what you want the world to look like when it's all over. That is, that there will be more jobs, higher growth, a stronger economy. \" The general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union, Mark Serwotka, said the package outlined in the leaks was \"a disgraceful way to treat staff who work hard and are committed to providing quality services, very often on low pay.\" Labour accused the government of playing politics with jobs. The shadow communities secretary, John Denham, told the BBC: \"If you've got a government coming along saying: 'Let's silence all the independent voices, let's silence the people who speak up about equalities' ... they are really saying: 'We will be able to do whatever we like and there won't be anyone able to shine a spotlight on what we are up to'.\" Shadow Europe minister Chris Bryant said: \"In dozens of countries the World Service is the only sane and independent source of news and information. Its success brings enormous benefits to the reputation of the UK and it is vital it remains strong and at an arms length from both the FCO and the BBC. \"The British Council is another key asset in persuading people to see Britain as an ally, a friend and a place to do business. Thousands learn English through it, including in emerging economies like India and china and the last thing we should be doing is undermining it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
