We condemn the sceptics, for when we traduce our public servants we also demean ourselves. In any event, it would have been impossible for Mr Hain and his people to keep tabs on all of the money from all of the supporters because there were just so many. The actor Richard Wilson was most obvious but there were others, on Flickr - the photo-sharing site - and on Facebook, where hain4labour boasted 1,114 \"friends\". They also gravitated towards him on MySpace, where the eclectic group on his official site - 165 in all - apparently included the presidential hopefuls Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and John Edwards. The result was overload and chaos, and now it seems that a few thousand pounds slipped down the side of an armchair. But we can't damn a man for that. \u00b7 It's not as if he's failing to show contrition. \"I sincerely apologise,\" he said following revelations in this newspaper yesterday. And on Monday, his Department of Work and Pensions released advice urging Britons to take \"personal responsibility\" for their finances, which clearly shows a minister determined to ensure others don't repeat his mistakes. Statesmanlike, selfless. That's him. \u00b7 Perhaps he should have been better protected from this sort of calamity. He needs the sort of people who will put themselves in harm's way; take the bullet. His former colleague John Reid has his security detail and there it was, trailing the former home secretary as he bought fancy shirts on Sunday at TM Lewin in Jermyn Street, central London. Without help, who knows, he might have been attacked by a terrorist or succumbed to buying one of those stripy pink shirts with the plain white collar. At that level they are vulnerable to almost anything. \u00b7 This need for security and privacy is something politicians well understand, so how to explain the rantings of Scottish MP Jim Devine, who has written to the home secretary urging her to make Prince Andrew pay for protecting his daughters? \"It is not the role of the British taxpayer to pay for the protection of two junior members of the royal family as they flirt and flaunt their way through the nightclubs of Europe,\" he says. But then he misunderstands the relationship between the monarchy and the British people. They play, we pay. Under another system, the likes of Channel 4 might pick up the tab and Royals on the Razzle might make a cable show. But the broadcasters well know they could do it for much less cash with Jade Goody. It might be classier too. So the MP should forget about any relief for the public purse and be glad that our money is still good enough for them. It's best that way. \u00b7 A question from Robert Kilroy-Silk, MEP for the East Midlands. \"Does the commission attribute the death of culture in France to its absorption into the EU?\" he asks, borrowing his thesis from Time magazine. \"Is this why it has no artist or writer of international standing?\" And if we file this alongside his earlier inquiry, when he asked whether Marks &amp; Spencer's mirrors were distorted to make women look thinner, a pattern emerges. Might we attribute the death of his TV career to his brain-dead observations? We may yet require him again to jolly proceedings at Westminster or at one of the drearier parish councils, but for now he entertains our European partners. If he were elsewhere, we would have to send them Jim Davidson or one of the Krankies. So carry on Kilroy. The nation is with you. \u00b7 And here's to Margaret Mills, 81, a volunteer feted by Lancashire police for helping to train young officers. \"I have been 'arrested' 41 times and I have been nearly sectioned three times,\" she says. \"I have even walked around Preston railway station with amphetamines in my pocket. A police sniffer dog caught me.\" This is unsung work, but every time the police arrest Pete Doherty it pays dividends. So thank you, Margaret. And drop the knife now, please. diary@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
