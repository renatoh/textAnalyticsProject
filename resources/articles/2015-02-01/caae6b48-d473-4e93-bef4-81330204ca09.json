Louis van Gaal\u2019s team had overturned Scott Laird\u2019s second-half goal for the League One side thanks to goals from Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini when the referee, Phil Dowd, awarded an 87th-minute penalty for a foul by the Preston goalkeeper, Thorsten Stuckmann, on Rooney. Television replays confirmed there was no contact between the pair, with the England captain hurdling the keeper before clipping the pitch with his right foot. Several former professionals accused Rooney of a dive but Simon Grayson, the Preston manager, absolved the striker of cheating and admitted Dowd could have had cause to award a penalty due to Stuckmann\u2019s challenge. Grayson said: \u201cI am not saying it wasn\u2019t a penalty, I am saying there was no contact. You can interpret that how you want. It wasn\u2019t a dive. He has gone to get out of the way and taken evasive action. \u201cSometimes you get those going for you and sometimes you don\u2019t. I am not complaining. There was also a push by Fellaini on Tom Clarke for their second goal but they were not blatant mistakes, just fine margins that didn\u2019t go our way on the night.\u201d The England manager, Roy Hodgson, also defended Rooney. Asked whether his captain had dived, Hodgson said in his role as a BBC pundit: \u201cNo, not for me. I think he\u2019s just taking evasive action there. If you are refereeing the game, I think in the run of play, without any of the replays we\u2019ve just seen now so many times, I don\u2019t think any of us refereeing the game in training would have said: \u2018That\u2019s not a penalty.\u2019 The goalkeeper\u2019s come out in that way, very rashly, he\u2019s gone with both feet. Wayne\u2019s touched the ball past him.\u201d Van Gaal admitted United were lucky with Herrera\u2019s equaliser, as Rooney was standing in an offside position when the midfielder\u2019s shot beat Stuckmann. The United manager said: \u201cIn the first half we didn\u2019t create many chances so that is why I changed the shape. That was I think why we make the goals in the second half. I think the first goal was a little lucky, the second goal was a training goal \u2013 fantastic \u2013 and the third goal was a penalty and the match was done. I have to give all the credit to the players because they have done again everything that was asked of them and the spirit in the team is unbelievable.\u201d United\u2019s quarter-final against Arsenal will be their first home match in this season\u2019s competition. \u201cI think that is the most important thing \u2013 that we have a draw at home,\u201d Van Gaal said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
