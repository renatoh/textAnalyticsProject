He has taken to wearing a summer-white suit \u2013 despite the chill wind \u2013 in the style of Mr Clean himself, Martin Bell. But his views on Liverpudlians can hardly be described as squeaky-clean. While moaning that there are no longer direct flights between his Highland retreat and Liverpool \u2013 he had to travel via Manchester \u2013 he says the one consolation is that burglaries in the Highlands have gone down. Just a joke, says Charlie. Brave man. Trouble for Harriet as Labour's drive to get more women into parliament hits a stumbling block in the north-east. North West Durham said it absolutely, positively did not want an all-female shortlist of applicants to replace Hilary Armstrong. We hear you, said the NEC. An all-female shortlist it is, then. Not just an argument about local candidates or practicalities, this, but rather a dispute about the core philosophy. Members \"believe that positively discriminating towards women is negatively discriminating against men, and they want the very best candidate, regardless of gender, religion or colour,\" local chairman Joe Armstrong tells the Newcastle Journal. \"All-women shortlists may have been necessary 20 years ago to encourage more women to enter politics, but they have served their purpose.\" Such failure to embrace the zeitgeist cannot but make Harriet angry. You wouldn't like her when she's angry. Continuing headaches too in Rochdale, where the \"trial\" of seven party members accused of misbehaviour and bullying of the selected candidate Simon Danczuk dragged on for so long on Sunday and Monday that it had to be extended. More nail-biting stuff this weekend. And these proceedings will no doubt be monitored by the website Rochdale Online, which had its representatives hovering outside the courtroom, the lounge of a local hotel, last Sunday. Party officials asked the hotel's management to throw them out, but that failed because the reporters had booked a room and claimed entitlement to be there. It will end in the next few days, probably in expulsions. But it won't end quietly. So the die is cast and Gordon will send a minister on to Question Time to grapple with Nick Griffin. Reports suggest Jack Straw. Perhaps John Denham. But who else to invite for this special occasion? Perhaps the chief rabbi. The panel could chew over Griffin's comment, \"The orthodox opinion is that 6 million Jews were gassed and cremated and turned into lampshades. Orthodox opinion also once held that the world was flat.\" Maybe Shahid Malik, the member of what Griffin once denounced as a \"wicked and vicious faith\". Or Chuka Umunna, Labour's rising star candidate in Streatham. He's mixed-race. According to Nick, he shouldn't exist. Maybe Gordon could send Mr Tony, to befuddle the BNP's talisman with that familiar winning smile and pin-sharp barrister's brain. But he'll have to book early: Mr Tony's busy. A top-drawer Asian charity event it was this week, and last week it was Chicago at the behest of the Swiss insurer Zurich. He advises them on climate change and global political trends. \"Bono is here doing the U2 concert, so we hooked up last night [at the Michigan Avenue hotel],\" Blair told the Chicago Tribune. He hangs with Bono now and he doesn't mind who knows it. He may not have any time for the likes of far-right Griff. Finally, it's undeniable that there is a new feeling about the House of Commons these days, as John Bercow (pictured) places his stamp on hundreds of years of tradition, and the Bercow children get to grips with the over-stuffy place. This week the Speaker was spied chasing his kids in Portcullis House, as they had become a tad rowdy, splashing by the fountain. They will settle down, and once again the place for childish pranks will be the chamber. Still, isn't it good to have genuine signs of life around?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
