Addressing 600 sub-postmasters, minister Pat McFadden will defend his government's policy of opening up postal services to more competition. And he will be told that 3,000 more post offices could close if the government allows benefit payments to be handled entirely by competitors. At one level, this is a technical argument made by an interest group fighting for a particular contract. For sub-postmasters, the post office card account (Poca) is a vital business that contributes up to 12% of their income. For ministers, it is a throwback from an age before mass-banking. Labour led the drive for paying benefits directly into bank accounts, and has already tried to phase out the Poca scheme. A petition signed by 4 million people helped stop that, but even so it is hard to imagine that a decade from now pensioners and benefit-recipients will queue at their local post offices with plastic cards to receive their dues. At another level, this debate shows up everything wrong in our debate over postal services. They are on the way to becoming a heritage industry, romanticised over by the able-bodied and the urban but used only by the isolated and financially excluded. Ever since the turn of the decade, as benefit payments, TV and driving licences were all shifted away from the post office, more and more branches have shut, while ministers and civil servants have come round to the unspoken view that the only sensible thing to do with vast tracts of the postal network is to manage its decline. This betrays a terrible lack of imagination. A network of retail outlets that, even after the proposed closures, will outnumber all the supermarkets put together could surely be seen as an opportunity too. At least three government departments could use post offices better: a Treasury that wants to boost financial literacy; a Department for Work and Pensions keen to make benefit payments accessible; and a Department for the Evironment committed to sustainable rural life. Where better to put these goals into action than a community meeting-place that at its best is already somewhere between a benefits office and a citizens' advice bureau? This was certainly the vision outlined in a 2000 report from Number 10's own policy unit; a \"one-stop shop\" that would allow everyone to access government services. It is also a lot closer to the way the French use their post offices. Our network of post offices may need rationalising, but it could certainly also benefit from far greater imagination."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
