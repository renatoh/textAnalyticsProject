On Open Heart, Bonacina has augmented her core trio with percussionist Mino Cinelu, the Gary Burton-like vibraphonist Pascal Schumacher, and vocalist Himiko Paganotti. In impressionistic, classical-sounding episodes such as the opening Souffle d'un Songe, the leader's folk-inflected melodic sense and subtle nuances continue to recall British baritone master John Surman. The jiving Circle Dance, however, is party music, with its funky hook, agile sax improv and Paganotti's Flora Purim-like scat. Wild World, a mix of animal growls and popping sax patterns, exploits this group's percussion power, while wistful ballads Watch Your Step and Pierrot demonstrate Bonacina's fertile imagination, and Snap the Slap is a a solo-sax stomper swapping punchy horn licks for gospelly vocals. The broader palette occasionally gives this set an indecisive feel, but Bonacina already sounds like a relaxed old hand as a postbop sax improviser."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
