The group said 3,500 products were being cut in price in the latest round of store wars. With its latest cuts, Tesco is claiming it is the cheapest supermarket in Britain on a selection of 10,000 products, saying it is 8% cheaper than Sainsbury's and 0.1% below Asda. But its rivals were not taking the comparisons lying down. A spokeswoman for Asda said: \"I think publicising a 0.1% price difference with us just shows how envious Tesco is of Asda's value position. \"We are very confident of our position. Our own surveys show we are 11.5% lower on price than the average of our competitors, and in the recent AC Nielsen survey, we pushed Tesco off the number one slot and were rated top overall and first on price.\" A spokesman for Sainsbury's said: \"We have invested well over \u00a3150m on price cuts this year and we guarantee lowest prices on the most popular items. \"We also invest heavily in promotions, which we know our customers value, and I believe the Grocer recently did a survey that showed we ran more promotions than any of our competitors.\" Tesco's move also comes a day before it announces its half-year financial results to the City. Analysts are forecasting the group will tomorrow report pre-tax profits of \u00a3480m - a jump from the \u00a3422m made in the comparative period last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
