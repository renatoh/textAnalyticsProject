The company decided the next series, due to air in the autumn, would be the last. It will mark the end of one of the BBC's most acclaimed long-running programmes. \"Some programmes - like Ally McBeal or The Bill - are designed to be endless shows and Playing the Field was also quite open-ended,\" said Tiger Aspect head of drama Greg Brenman. \"But this is a positive thing - we wanted to end with a bang and move on to new projects.\" Relevant stories: Feb 1: Whistle blown on Playing the Field"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
