He will expect to get the better of Wales in the Euro 2012 qualifier at Wembley but the manager must realise by now that it is impossible to overcome all the habits of English footballers. During training on Monday, a throw-in was hurled down the line so that the recipient and his marker were left to fight for it. Forty-three months after Capello's first fixture, a friendly with Switzerland, he has still not imposed his will entirely on these players. The real change seemed to lie in his good-natured stoicism. He wanted those throw-ins to be tossed inside to, say, the feet of an unmarked defender. Capello's wishes were ignored. \"I had a meeting yesterday and they made the same mistakes today,\" he said. \"So why did I have the meeting?\" The Italian might have been in a rage at that instant in the practice session but he came across as good-humoured afterwards. The past few days have been kind to him, with England exercising their command in the victory away to Bulgaria while Montenegro dropped three points behind Capello's side after losing in Cardiff. His mood, all the same, is not just a reflection of the Group G arithmetic. It could be that he is warmed by the thought of returning to Italy when his contract with the FA expires next summer and, he insists, settling into retirement at the then age of 66. There is some cantankerousness left in him. Capello has seemed a bit of a curmudgeon for a while now, still aggrieved that 4-4-2, in its purest sense, is virtually extinct. We often hear his grumble about the \"9-1\" formation that he sees everywhere. He has acquiesced, whether the England system is now described as 4-3-3 or, as it was in Bulgaria, 4-2-3-1. Uncompromising as he looks, Capello has still reached an accommodation with contemporary thinking. It is hard even to recall that England were playing a hoary 4-4-2, with Wayne Rooney and Jermain Defoe in attack, when Germany routed them in last year's World Cup. Capello changed his ways in an effort to safeguard his reputation while also reshaping the squad. In the closing years of his career, he has had to ditch some assumptions. To a degree, it has suited Capello that he is no longer viewed as a colossus. He and virtually all his peers must believe in their hearts that a prize will come their way only if Spain go badly off course. The expectations surrounding Capello and his counterparts have shrunk. Managers of international teams are no longer taken for magisterial and irreplaceable presences when Spain could win Euro 2008 under the command of Luis Aragon\u00e9s then the 2010 World Cup with Vicente del Bosque. Capello is not treated now as the shaman who could bring down a blight on Croatia, the foe who had afflicted his predecessor Steve McClaren. While he can now be classified as one more fallible human being, he seemed almost glad of the demotion. \"I think they understood me better,\" he said of the rapport with the squad. \"I'm focused always during training. We work one hour, one hour-and-a-half. You need to do this, this and this. OK? Afterwards I'm relaxed absolutely and they can do anything. My relationship with the players was always the same. Now they understand that I'm not an ogre.\" The FA had surely been on the lookout for at least a tyrant when it approached Capello. For the time being, it is better for him to be perceived as a nurturer. The manager is adamant, regardless of previous reports, that he has never banned the England squad from playing golf. A country so dejected by its team's underachievement swooned at the thought of Capello meting out overdue punishment but it was not his task to bring about a reckoning with anyone for events before his arrival. He is more evasive than supposed but no one stays in his line of work for so long without knowing how to dodge trouble. Lapses are rare although the most recent came, in the spring of this year, when he stepped out of the football scene and was reported to have complained about immigration into Italy. \"Twenty-eight thousand refugees from North Africa,\" he said. \"It's too much.\" Capello usually recognises that his analytical powers are best applied to the football pitch. He ponders how to inhibit the midfielder Gareth Bale, whether he is on the left or, as Wales deployed him against Montenegro, on the right. He also has to ponder the finesse that may have to be applied in particular instances. Having restricted Frank Lampard to the last 10 minutes in Bulgaria, Capello is now at pains to underline the relevance of a 33-year-old with such a hoard of know-how. The manager had spent his life in club management, where players, cash permitting, can be ditched and replaced. Tact becomes essential when a person like Capello takes charge of a country. Consideration for the feelings of mere employees may not be mandatory on the club scene, where replacements can be bought, but this manager has stayed on good terms with his players, particularly those of high standing within the squad. England have not yet been altered as thoroughly as the FA would have hoped but these have undoubtedly been years of change and even compromise for Capello himself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
