Sex.com is the top banana in Zetetic's list of the All-Time Top Domain Sales, having changed hands for a cool $14 million earlier this year (following a long-running ownership battle under which the original owner, Gary Kremen, is owed $65m in damages). Seven of the top 10 were purchased in 1999, at the peak of the dotcom bubble - examples include business.com ($7.5m), wine.com ($3.3m) and loans.com ($3.0m) - but Zetetic reckons the market is hotting up again. Which may mean that all those tales of Bubble 2.0 really are coming to pass; inflated domain prices may be the second horse of the online apocalypse, the first, of course, being startups getting huge cash inflows (the first time from venture capitalists, this time from established internet giants such as Yahoo and Google; it's progress, of sorts). Zetetic says that sales of 5,851 domain names generated $29m in 2005, compared with 3,813 sales worth $15m in 2004. It's also evident at Domain Name Journal magazine, which publishes a weekly Top 20 chart. Over Easter, MovieRentals.com was sold for $100,249, and CubanCigars.com for $55,000. The companies that make a living out of this kind of speculation are ponying up big bucks to play. According to a story in USA Today: \"Publicly traded Marchex spent $164m on more than 100,000 domain names, including destination.com and debts.com last year. It works with Yahoo to direct advertisers to specialised websites such as videocamera.com. Separately, Marchex has acquired 74,000 zip code domains, such as 90210.com.\" But domain names are not always a safe bet. The $3.35m paid for altavista.com in 1999 doesn't look quite such a good deal today. And what about the \u00a330 spent by Diana George of Hickling, Norwich, who leapt (figuratively) into cyberspace in May 2000 to register leoblair.com and leoblair.co.uk as the name of the prime minister's youngest child was announced? The .com seems to have changed hands (or perhaps just lapsed) in September 2003, and the .co.uk version in October 2004. We don't know whether she made a profit - or whether Charles Sweeney did. The IT consultant from East Kilbride registered babyleo.co.uk in 2000; the domain is now apparently registered to an Austrian, Daniela Noisternigg, whose name is used peculiarly often to re-register lapsed sites.
