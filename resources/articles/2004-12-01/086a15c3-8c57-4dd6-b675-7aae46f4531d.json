The government has decided that it is unclear videogame ratings on the packaging, and not ill-informed parents, who are responsible for children playing violent games. To be honest this is getting tedious. The ratings on game boxes seem clear enough to me, but it is obvious that some parents need educating. After all, the general consensus is still that games are relatively harmless - Mario and Lara, with a bit of Pac-Man for afters. And anyway, surely the box cover art of games like the Getaway and GTA: San Andreas hints that their content may be less than fluffy. Chances are the Daily Mail et al will be all over this in the next few days. Yippee."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
