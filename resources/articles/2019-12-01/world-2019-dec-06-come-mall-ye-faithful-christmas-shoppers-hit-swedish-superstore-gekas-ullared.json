Little known outside Scandinavia, Gek\u00e5s Ullared \u2013 situated about 60 miles (100km) south of Gothenburg \u2013 is Sweden\u2019s most popular visitor attraction, with almost 5 million customers a year. Covering an area bigger than five football pitches, it has 3,500 parking spaces, 9,000 shopping trolleys and 82 checkouts. The inverse of stylish Scandi shopping, the store is renowned for sharp-elbowed crowds eager to snap up well-known brands at bargain prices. Its success in Sweden is unrivalled. Turnover has grown uninterrupted each year since Ullared opened in 1963, reaching about $500m (\u00a3379m) last year. In 2018, it sold 13 million pairs of socks, its most popular item. The clothing department alone has 95 fitting rooms. \u201cIt\u2019s the nearest thing to Primark, but 100 times bigger,\u201d said Rosie Sidenhj\u00e4rta, 60, a marketing consultant from V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, a city in central Sweden. At half past midnight on Friday, she was due to board a coach for the nine-hour drive to Gek\u00e5s Ullared, set in a small town in Falkenberg Municipality, Halland County. \u201cIt is so much more than shopping,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is discoveries, community, emotions and good times. And I do more than 15,000 steps a day [while shopping there], so it\u2019s also good exercise.\u201d For Sidenhj\u00e4rta, this is a family tradition. A few weeks ago she was there with her daughter as a 30th birthday present. They stayed overnight at the chalet village belonging to the store, where customers can turn a day\u2019s shopping into a weekend, or longer. Home decor, clothes, toiletries, toys, hobbies, food, technology and white goods \u2013 Gek\u00e5s Ullared sells everything that can fit into or on to a family car. The average customer is 43 years old and lives about 140 miles (230km) away. About two-thirds are women. It has no online outlet. On Facebook people buy goods through others who shop there, with in-store customers charging 30 crowns (\u00a32.40), plus postage, to make purchases for others. Peter Magnusson, 39, a teaching assistant from the city of Bor\u00e5s, 55 miles (90km) north of Ullared, is planning his sixth trip this year to pick up Christmas gifts. \u201cMy friends think I am a little crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut everything there is just cheaper. You can find the same things as anywhere else, but at a better price.\u201d Magnusson is proud that he has appeared in two episodes of a hit reality TV show about Ullared that enters its 11th season next year. The series has turned some of the store\u2019s colourful staff into household names in Sweden, not least its CEO, Boris Lennerhov. \u201cOur secret is in our low-price concept \u2013 people want to pay as little as possible, and our quality is good,\u201d Lennerhov said. \u201cAt the time, we are always trying to introduce new features, rather like an amusement park.\u201d Over the years, the Gek\u00e5s Ullared complex has added a hotel, campsite, skiing, an adventure park, fishing, a golf course and plenty of restaurants, with events and entertainments designed to turn a shopping trip into a shopping holiday. Recently the company chartered aircraft to fly shoppers from Sweden\u2019s far north. But Lennerhov has no plans to take the model elsewhere in Sweden, let alone abroad. The store\u2019s private owners, Gek\u00e5s, are convinced that the Ullared magic cannot be replicated \u2013 any attempt to do so could never live up to the original and would dilute the experience in Ullared itself. \u201cThis is unique,\u201d Lennerhov said. Gek\u00e5s Ullared is an adventure, and the company understands this, according to Karin M Ekstr\u00f6m, a professor of marketing at the University of Bor\u00e5s. \u201cThey work very hard to make Ullared fun, so shoppers are not tired and grumpy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe prices also make it possible for low-income families to participate in mainstream consumer culture, in which shopping is to be part of society. Generations go there \u2013 people say they went with their parents, and now they are here with their children.\u201d Not everyone is impressed. \u201cIt\u2019s pandemonium \u2013 I hated it,\u201d says Elaine Patterson, 43, a Swede with Scottish roots who lives in Link\u00f6ping in southern Sweden. \u201cSo many people with no manners, running into you with their trolleys and pinching things from your basket. It\u2019s just not fun.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
