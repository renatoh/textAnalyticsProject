In a mistake on a par with banning booze from the ceremony, the organisers mistakenly pointed the www.britawards.co.uk web address at a long-forgotten viral marketing game that I-Next set up as a test site some time ago. As a result, thousands of people have found themselves playing the game, a kind of fantasy marketing agency affair, rather than finding out about the music awards. \u00b7 Still on the subject of the Brits, paid-for search company E-Spotting has discovered a way of dispensing with all the peripheries - like the Stars in Their Eyes style set, the D-list presenters and Davina McCall. It has produced a list of winners based on the number of times people search for them on the web. While certainly more democratic, the result is even more depressing - Blue for best British group, Sophie Ellis-Bextor for best female and, erm, Gareth Gates for best single. \u00b7 Forget lonely-hearts columns and even internet or speed dating. The next big thing seems to be mobile-phone dating, judging by the volume of press releases trumpeting new services in Diary's inbox. By far the most frightening development is the launch of a location-based picture messaging service from Mobile Entertainment Corporation. The idea being that you request a date and are immediately sent a picture of your intended, based on where you happen to be at the time. Raising the disturbing prospect of people trudging around the supermarket or sitting on a bus only to look up and find a fellow date-seeker peering intently at them from behind their mobile phone. \u00b7 How long will it be before BT cuts the wholesale price of its broadband connections again in an effort to stimulate demand? Industry wisdom suggests that BT will be able to reach its target of one million customers on its network by the summer but that demand will then level off - prompting another price cut. Pressed on the issue recently, smooth-talking BT Retail chief Pierre Danon insisted that there would be no price cut for its own BT Broadband service \"this year\". So Diary's money is on very early next year. And for all BT's protestations that it is unable to cut prices any further without losing money, rivals suspect that it still makes at least \u00a35 profit per subscriber at the current price. \u00b7 Finally, well done to all the winners at last Thursday's glittering UK Internet Industry Awards but particularly Sheffield MP Richard Allan - one of the few in parliament who understands the web and the internet industry - who scooped the \"Internet Hero\" award.
