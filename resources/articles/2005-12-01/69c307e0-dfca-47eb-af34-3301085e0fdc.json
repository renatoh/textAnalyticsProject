Tomorrow night he will feel even lonelier when he steps up to kick the points on one of rugby's most intimidating stages. After last weekend, Perpignan's coach Philippe Boher has made sure that Ross will be a marked man and the 13,500 Catalans expected at Stade Aim\u00e9-Giral will not be slow in letting him know what they think of the fly-half, whose antics mounted an unexpected roadblock on their path to the knock-out stages of the Heineken Cup. In stoppage-time at Headingley on Sunday, Ross's former Scotland team-mate, Gordon Bullock, scored a try which left Ross with a conversion to snatch a game that Perpignan had looked to have tied up with tries by Nicolas Durand and Jean-Philippe Grandclaude, and 10 points from the boot of Nicolas Laharrague. Ross missed but the Welsh referee Nigel Owen ordered it to be re-taken and Leeds scrambled home 21-20. Boher was fuming and saw it as part of a Celtic plot to aid Cardiff, who also have 10 points at the top of Pool 2. \"I think Cardiff will be very happy with this decision, made by a Welsh referee,\" he said in a less than sporting manner. \"If you had told me he was an Irish, Italian or Scottish referee, there would be no questions.\" So what did Ross do to provoke Owens's intervention and leave everyone checking the rulebook to see whether the referee had exceeded his powers? \"We deservedly got a score to get us within a point,\" said Ross. \"It was a good forward drive and I had the kick to win the game. Unfortunately I pulled it, but during that a few of their boys shouted and made noises in an attempt to put me off. To be honest I don't think it made a difference, but I ostentatiously pleaded with the referee that they were making a noise and thankfully he gave us a second chance. It was a bit bizarre at the end of the game, but we like to think that we had a little bit of luck. It hasn't all been going our way.\" Quite the contrary. Because of injuries and bad form Leeds lost the first eight games of their season and, after reports of a bust-up with senior players on the team coach, their director of rugby Phil Davies announced that he would cease to be involved with the first team once he had found a new head coach. That is yet to happen and after four games without defeat there are those who wonder if it will. Davies, a former Wales lock, now concerns himself with the forwards, handing over much more responsibility to the former Leeds Rhinos head coach Daryl Powell. Another ex-rugby league player, Simon Middleton, looks after defence. The club captain Stuart Hooper has also returned from injury and, according to Ross, their two expensive imports, Bulloch and the All Black scrum-half Justin Marshall, have settled in. \"It's the same faces and names, but their roles have changed an awful lot. Daryl is looking after the backs and the team structure and those who have seen us recently have noticed a big change in the way we play. \"After last season [when Leeds came with a late run to avoid relegation and win the Powergen Cup and with it a Heineken place] I think we just thought we would take up where we left off and didn't work hard enough. That made it hard for the new guys coming in. They were a bit over-enthusiastic, trying too hard to impress initially. Now they've settled and maybe taken a little step back, finding they can let other guys take it on.\" Ross is also candid about his own form, which he admits was \"shocking\" at the start of the season. In the past month he has begun to enjoy his rugby again and is convinced that the upturn in Leeds' fortunes will help him to regain his Scotland place for the Six Nations. But first there is the Heineken Cup and Perpignan. Ross has never sampled Stade Aim\u00e9- Giral but expects a warm reception. \"They tell me it's pretty intimidating, quite hostile, but one of the places where you want to play,\" says the 27-year-old, who at 5ft 8in will be one of the smallest men on the field. \"They've got a big pack and it's going to be hard but I've played a couple of times in France. It got quite violent a few years ago in Biarritz when the referee sent off a couple of their players and we got a bit of a reception at the end of the game, but not to worry. It's a big challenge because they'll certainly want revenge for what happened last weekend. They weren't happy at the end. Only the English-speaking guys shook hands with us.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
