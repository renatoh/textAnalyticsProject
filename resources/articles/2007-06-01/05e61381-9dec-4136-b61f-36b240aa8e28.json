The style of his fifth victory in eight outings this year also shattered claims that the 21-year-old had been winning only because of the superior power of his Marlboro Ducati Desmosedici GP7. Stoner beat the American Colin Edwards (Fiat Yamaha) into second by almost 12 seconds, with another Australian, Chris Vermeulen, third on his Rizla Suzuki. The seven-times world champion Valentino Rossi, who had hoped to beat Stoner on Donington's sinuous curves, had to settle for fourth on his Fiat Yamaha. \"This proves to a lot of people that the Ducati doesn't just have power,\" said Stoner, who holds a 26-point lead over Rossi. \"We've been improving the bike's weaker points and now there are none.\" Stoner's father, Colin, who sold his farm in Australia to bring his son to race in Europe at the age of 14, said: \"We could see Casey's talent on a bike when he was only three. When he was four, a Japanese magazine asked him what he wanted to do and he said he wanted to be like Mick Doohan and Wayne Gardner [former Australian world champions].\" The race started in a downpour but ended on a drying track, with the survivors seeking out damp patches to preserve their wet-weather tyres. The Spaniard Dani Pedrosa (Repsol Honda) led for the first four laps, as Stoner finished the first lap in seventh place after fluffing the start. But he hauled himself into second place behind Edwards after five laps. In the ensuing struggle Edwards ran wide at the hairpin at half distance and Stoner took the opportunity to take the lead. \"The front wheel locked up and, if it had still been wet by then, I would have been down the road,\" Edwards said. \"After that I was hanging on for dear life.\" The reigning world champion Nicky Hayden (Repsol Honda) and the MotoGP debutant Anthony West (Kawasaki), who climbed from 17th place to fifth in four laps, were among the early fallers, though both remounted, West going on to claim his first MotoGP points with 11th place. In the 250cc race Britain's Dan Linfoot, 18, took his Aprilia into ninth place in his first grand prix of the season and in the 125cc event Oxfordshire's Bradley Smith, 16, came seventh on his Repsol Honda."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
