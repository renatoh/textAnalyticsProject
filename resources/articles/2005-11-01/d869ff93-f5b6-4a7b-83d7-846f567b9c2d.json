But has there been a sudden conversion to the use of private contractors at the union's leafy Wimbledon HQ? Former art director Andy Long certainly thinks so. He quit recently over what he alleges were intimidatory management tactics, the sacking of a colleague and a plan to outsource design of the union's monthly magazine CWU Voice. A spokesman for the union denies any such plan and insists that, while the design team may be slimmed down, art direction of the magazine will be kept in-house. Long alleges that an increasing amount of the union's communications work is being outsourced to Liverpool. At least it won't be going to India - the union's real bugbear. \u00b7 Good to see the Daily Star, not a paper noted for its coverage of the big geopolitical issues, devoting its front page to the so-called \"clash of civilisations\". Well, OK, half its front page - the other half is dominated by a woman in a red thong and the headline \"Rachel says knickers to Rod\". Anyway, back to the geopolitics. \"Burka Barbie: She puts the fun into fundamentalism\" introduces a touching story about Fulla, an attractive-looking doll in a hijab which has become the most popular toy in the Arab world. The Star claims the story as an exclusive, though the Guardian ran it as a news in brief on September 23. But let's not fall out over a much-abused word. What's harder to forgive is the cartoon on page six portraying Fulla's boyfriend Ken as a suicide bomber blowing himself up in a toy shop. Tasteful. \u00b7 Also in the Star - the Diary's sources are many and various - is the news that Jose Mourinho has won the coveted title of Best-Dressed Football Manager of All Time. Not, you might think, an especially competitive field. \u00b7 Has James Purnell, the minister for creative industries and tourism, whose brief bizarrely encompasses binge drinking (can public vomiting be a creative act?), ever been pissed? That was the uncompromising question Guardian Rottweiler David Hencke put to the squeaky-clean Blairite ultra this week. \"I don't reply to surveys,\" replied the youthful minister grandly. We'll take that as a slightly sloshed yes, then. \u00b7 Arts briefing 1: Opera singers in Italy are on hunger strike over proposed cuts in the government's culture budget that may mean La Scala having to restage Donizetti's La Fille du R\u00e9giment with just a battalion. The Chorus of Hebrew Slaves is in revolt, culture minister Rocco Buttiglione is threatening to resign, and prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has inflamed the situation by saying opera houses are grossly overstaffed and ballet dancers shouldn't be allowed to retire at 40 (has he missed the pointe?). No one knows how the dispute will end, but all are agreed it won't be over till the unusually svelte lady sings. \u00b7 Arts briefing 2: The enterprising Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment is staging an innovative pre-concert event at London's Queen Elizabeth Hall next Thursday when Glyndebourne's highly regarded music director, Vladimir Jurowski, will conduct audience members in \"patriotic Gallic numbers\" such as the stirring Chant du neuf Thermidor by Rouget de Lisle, who wrote the Marseillaise. All together now ... \"While talking about Liberty,/ They were preparing for tyranny./ By day, they cursed the kings/ And their unholy doings;/ By night, they were digging trenches:/ The graves of our people and their rights.\" The event is called Sing the Revolution!, and the advice is don't leave your car anywhere near the South Bank on November 24. \u00b7 No space for the amazing tale of what happened when Kate Moss, Johnny Depp, Jamie Oliver, David Beckham, Cherie Blair, David Davis, Chinese president Hu Jintao and a dance troupe from Chelmsford High School for Girls were trapped for four hours in a lift at Claridge's. But we may return to it later in the week. stephen.moss@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
