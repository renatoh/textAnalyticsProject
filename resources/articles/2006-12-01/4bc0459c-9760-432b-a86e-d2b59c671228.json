Unfortunately, disposing of your old binary companion isn't straightforward. First off, there's the problem of security. You can never be certain what will happen to your PC once it's out of your hands, so it's important to wipe absolutely everything from the hard disk. Failing to do so can reveal vital personal information, such as passwords and the types of online purchases you make. Simply trashing files isn't good enough, as fragments of data can still be recovered from the hard disk. The best thing to do is reformat the computer by installing a clean copy of the operating system. Once done, running the Wipe function of software such as Norton Utilities should clear any remaining data. As well as security, there's the problem of what to do with the hardware. The amount of electronic waste requiring disposal is becoming an increasing problem, compounded in the case of computers by the hazardous pollutants inside; in other words, you can't just chuck it out with the potato peelings. A visit to IT For Charities (www.itforcharities.co.uk) should provide an answer, listing a host of resources throughout the country that will take your PC away for recycling. Luckily, an EU directive coming into force next year will remove this headache by making it the manufacturers' responsibility to dispose of old electronics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
