By the time DaMarcus Beasley and Kyle Lafferty scored their side's fifth and sixth goals, Motherwell were totally subdued. The Fir Park side's resistance, in the instant Ben Hutchinson scored after Kenny Miller's double and Kris Boyd's single had already ensured victory for the home side, soon collapsed as Lafferty resumed the scoring. Having scored within the opening 10 minutes of each of their previous four home league games, Rangers had clearly developed a taste for the early strike. They indulged themselves again when Miller gave them the lead, and then created something of a mystery by going such a long time afterwards without adding to their credit. Motherwell had looked apprehensive and uncertain even in the four minutes that preceded Miller's goal, and it was no surprise when they conceded. The visitors' lack of conviction caused the kind of hesitation that allowed Steve Davis a long time without challenge before he slipped the ball to Miller, the striker side-footing the 18-yard shot high to the left of John Ruddy. Unsurprisingly, the goal gave the home side the idea that there were rich pickings to be had, and seemed to deepen the Motherwell players' misgivings about their prospects of escaping further misery. Their dread would have been vindicated soon after, had Steven Saunders not twice denied Boyd by stopping the striker's net-bound efforts on the goal line. Boyd had been given his opportunities \u2013 both arrived during the same action sequence \u2013 by sluggish defending among the visitors, a trait that would cause one or two more alarms around Ruddy before the interval. Even so, the longer Rangers went without finding the net for a second time, the more confidence Motherwell appeared to gather. By the time Steven Jennings jinked past a couple of home defenders and delivered a well-controlled shot that was pushed wide by Allan McGregor, they seemed to have developed a certain temerity. Still, Rangers should have extended their advantage on the stroke of half time when a neat move involving Boyd, Davis and Miller ended with Sasa Papac looking at Ruddy from just 12 yards and not a challenge in the vicinity. The left-back gave the goalkeeper the chance to save with his feet by placing the low drive too close to him on the left. When they did double their advantage, they received some assistance from a strangely hesitant Ruddy. The goalkeeper, who had distinguished himself the week before against Celtic and who had effected some important saves in this match, advanced to meet Miller as the latter ran on to Madjid Bougherra's long ball out of defence. He then appeared to slow down, allowing Miller to touch the ball past him, run on and slip it into the net. Almost inevitably, the prolific Boyd would deliver the third before leaving, to be replaced by Lafferty, in the71st minute. Boyd may have had the luxury of a tap-in, but it was the result of the most impressive move of the match. Beasley swept the ball out to Davis on the right, and the midfielder's diagonal ball allowed the charging Boyd simply to prod the ball past Ruddy. Lafferty, his replacement, scored the fourth, also with a tap-in, but not before Motherwell had scored with only their second attempt of the match. Tom Hateley's corner kick from the left allowed Hutchinson a free header, which he sent past McGregor from six yards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
