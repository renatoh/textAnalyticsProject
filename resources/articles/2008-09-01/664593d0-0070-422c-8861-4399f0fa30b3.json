'Children of the revolution' (Observer Magazine, 31 August) said that the increasing popularity of schools in Hackney, London, may be due in part to outsourcing the running of education to Cambridge Educational Associates. This should have been the Learning Trust. 'Kaka could join the City revolution' (Sport, last week) said 'The Abu Dhabi United Group (ADUG) forms part of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), a sovereign wealth fund managing an estimated \u00a3283bn worth of assets.' We have been asked to make clear that ADIA is not part of ADUG and has no connection with Manchester City. Apologies. 'When Barack's berserkers lost the plot' (Comment, last week) discussed Sarah Palin's portrayal in the American press, saying: 'Palin was meant to be pretending that a handicapped baby girl was her child when really it was her wanton teenage daughter's.'
