Sanders, speaking to a friendly audience at George Washington University in Washington DC, presented himself as the heir to a progressive tradition championed by Franklin Roosevelt and Martin Luther King Jr as he argued that a wholesale \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d was the only antidote to the \u201ctyranny of oligarchs, multinational corporations, Wall Street banks and billionaires\u201d. \u201cIt is my very strong belief that the United States must reject that path of hatred and divisiveness \u2013 and instead find the moral conviction to choose a different path, a higher path, a path of compassion, justice and love,\u201d Sanders said in a defiant, 45-minute speech. \u201cIt is the path that I call democratic socialism.\u201d The speech comes at a critical moment for the senator\u2019s campaign, two weeks before the first Democratic presidential debate and amid rising tensions over what direction to move the party. The challenge facing Sanders, who consistently runs second in national and state polls behind Joe Biden, is whether he can convince Democratic voters that his populist platform is not a barrier to the presidency and that he is the strongest candidate to take on Donald Trump. To make that case, Sanders on Wednesday turned to history, comparing the current political moment to the post-Depression years, when nationalism, bigotry and xenophobia were on the rise around the world. \u201cWe in the United States, thank God, made a different choice than Europe did in responding to the era\u2019s social and economic crises,\u201d he said. \u201cWe rejected the ideology of Mussolini and Hitler \u2013 we instead embraced the bold and visionary leadership of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, then the leader of the progressive wing of the Democratic party.\u201d Like Roosevelt, Sanders presented himself as a progressive visionary who could mobilize the opposition to the twin economic and social forces that helped elect Trump in 2016. \u201cIn the year 2019 the United States and the rest of the world face two very different political paths.\u201d Sanders said. \u201cOn one hand, there is a growing movement towards oligarchy and authoritarianism in which a small number of incredibly wealthy and powerful billionaires own and control a significant part of the economy and exert enormous influence over the political life of our country. \u201cOn the other hand, in opposition to oligarchy, there is a movement of working people and young people who, in ever increasing numbers, are fighting for justice.\u201d Many Democrats disagree with his diagnosis of the current state of affairs and fear Sanders\u2019 leftwing politics will be used to tar the entire party and deliver the presidency to Trump for a second term. \u201cBernie \u2764 socialism \u2026 and so do his 2020 comrades,\u201d said the subject of an email sent by the Republican National Committee moments before Sanders appeared on stage. \u201cDemocrats must say loudly and clearly that we are not socialists,\u201d the presidential candidate John Hickenlooper will say in a speech rebutting Sanders on Thursday. \u201cIf we do not, we will end up re-electing the worst president in our country\u2019s history.\u201d Sanders said he anticipated \u201cmassive attacks from those who attempt to use the word \u2018socialism\u2019 as a slur.\u201d He added: \u201cI have faced and overcome these attacks for decades. And I am not the only one.\u201d He recalled Roosevelt, quoting from a 1936 campaign speech: \u201cNever before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for me \u2013 and I welcome their hatred.\u201d At that remark, which Sanders delivered with a characteristic roar, the audience rose to its feet, whooping and applauding. When the room quieted, Sanders quipped: \u201cI must say, it does sound a little contemporary doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Sanders accused Trump and the Republican party of \u201chypocrisy\u201d for their attacks on his ideology and quoted King\u2019s observation that the US \u201chas socialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the poor\u201d. \u201cWhile President Trump and his fellow oligarchs attack us for our support of democratic socialism, they don\u2019t really oppose all forms of socialism,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may hate democratic socialism because it benefits working people, but they absolutely love corporate socialism that enriches Trump and other billionaires.\u201d Sanders gave a similar address on democratic socialism during his first presidential campaign four years ago but the landscape has shifted dramatically since then. Unlike the Democratic primary in 2016, when Sanders was the sole progressive alternative to Hillary Clinton, he now faces competition from a sprawling field that includes candidates who, like the party\u2019s base, are young, diverse and progressive. In the wake of Sanders\u2019 first presidential bid, perceptions of socialism have changed, especially among young voters. A Gallup poll from 2018 found that a majority of young Americans have a positive view of socialism and a recent Axios survey found that 55% of women between the ages of 18 and 54 say they would prefer to live in a \u201csocialist\u201d country. And yet a Gallup poll released in May found that less than half of American voters say they would vote for a \u201cqualified presidential candidate who is a socialist\u201d. During his remarks, Sanders lingered on the concept of freedom \u2013 asking rhetorically: \u201cWhat does it actually mean to be free?\u201d He followed with a series of questions: \u201cAre you truly free if you are unable to go to a doctor when you are sick, or face financial bankruptcy when you leave the hospital? Are you truly free if you cannot afford the prescription drug you need to stay alive? \u201cTo me, the answer to those questions, in the wealthiest nation on earth, is no, you are not free.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
