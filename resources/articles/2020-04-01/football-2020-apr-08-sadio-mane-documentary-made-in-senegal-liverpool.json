From childhood memories of using a grapefruit as a ball in the remote village of Bambali to Liverpool\u2019s Champions League triumph in 2019, Made in Senegal features Man\u00e9 narrating his rags-to-riches story and includes interviews with J\u00fcrgen Klopp and several of his Anfield teammates including Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk. Yet Man\u00e9\u2019s recollection of the day his father died is undoubtedly its most poignant moment. \u201cI was seven years old,\u201d he says in the film. \u201cWe were about to play on the field when a cousin approached me and said: \u2018Sadio, your father passed away.\u2019 I replied: \u2018Oh really? He\u2019s joking \u2026\u2019 I couldn\u2019t really understand it.\u201d \u201cBefore he passed away, he had this kind of sickness for weeks,\u201d Man\u00e9 tells the Guardian. \u201cWe brought him some traditional medicine and it kept him calm for three or four months. The sickness came back but this time the medicine didn\u2019t work and because there was no hospital in Bambali they had to take him to the next village to see if they could save his life. But it was not the case. \u201cWhen I was young my dad was always saying how proud he was of me,\u201d he adds. \u201cHe was a man with a big heart. When he died, it had a big impact on me and the rest of my family. I said to myself: \u2018Now I have to do my best to help my mother.\u2019 That\u2019s a hard thing to deal with when you are so young.\u201d Two decades on, a hospital funded solely by Man\u00e9 is due to open in around six months\u2019 time to go with the school he built in his home village last year and he says the circumstances surrounding his father\u2019s death are a major reason for his philanthropy in S\u00e9dhiou province, where the World Bank estimates almost 70% of families live in poverty. \u201cI remember my sister was also born at home because there is no hospital in our village. It was a really, really sad situation for everyone. I wanted to build one to give people hope.\u201d Man\u00e9\u2019s father was an imam and the family gather every year on the anniversary of his death to recite the Qur\u2019an. Having failed to convince his family to allow him to abandon his education so he could pursue his ambition of becoming a professional footballer, Man\u00e9 ran away from home at the age of 15 with the help of a childhood friend Luc Djiboune. \u201cIt was tough because I didn\u2019t have anyone behind me to push me to achieve my dream,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I never stopped dreaming. It was really brave to leave my family in the village and go to Dakar but I knew that I could be successful. After that, my family started to take it more seriously and knew that I didn\u2019t want to do anything else. They knew they had no choice so they helped me.\u201d It was at the Generation Foot academy in the Senegal capital, Dakar, that Man\u00e9\u2019s journey to stardom really began after he scored four goals during a trial match. \u201cI think they were impressed,\u201d he says in the film. Under the watchful eye of founder Mady Tour\u00e9, whom Man\u00e9 describes as \u201clike a dad to me\u201d, he was snapped up by the French club Metz at the start of 2011 and moved to the Austrian side Red Bull Salzburg 18 months later having played a key role in Senegal\u2019s run to the quarter-finals of the 2012 Olympics. Klopp remembers passing up the chance to sign him for Borussia Dortmund in 2014 having made a judgment based on the way he was wearing his baseball cap. \u201cHe said I was like a rapper!\u201d Man\u00e9 says, chuckling at the memory. \u201cBut I think I gave my best so what can I say? That\u2019s part of life \u2013 you never know how you are going to get along with people. But I think he was wrong for sure. It was an experience for me as well though. I knew I had to show him more until we met again \u2026\u201d Klopp finally got his man in 2016 after Man\u00e9 scored four goals in three appearances against Liverpool for Southampton, and Man\u00e9\u2019s admiration for his manager is evident in the film as he is shown driving home following the incredible comeback victory over Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final last year. \u201cWhat makes him special is that he never stops believing,\u201d he says now. \u201cIn the meeting before the game he was really convinced that we could do it. Even though we were missing two of the best players in the world [Salah and Roberto Firmino]. He pushed the boys hard to give everything possible and tried to take the pressure off us.\u201d The dressing room celebrations after Liverpool\u2019s victory over Tottenham in Madrid make for entertaining viewing but that is nothing compared with the reception Man\u00e9 receives on his return to Bambali. Walking around the village surrounded by jubilant fans, he recognises an old lady and asks why she hasn\u2019t returned his phone calls? \u201cYou\u2019d call me if you missed me,\u201d he says. \u201cI gave you my number.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t got a phone,\u201d comes the reply, much to Man\u00e9\u2019s amusement. His naturally cheerful demeanour and humbleness shine throughout the documentary, especially when he addresses a crowd of youths outside the new school and tells them \u201ceducation is the key\u201d. \u201cSchool comes first,\u201d he says. \u201cYou should be in good health before you go to work, so let\u2019s finish the hospital.\u201d \u201cWhen you see these kind of people and the offerings in front of the house, you think: \u2018Wow, I have to work even harder for them,\u201d says Man\u00e9, who has also contributed \u00a340,000 to the Senegal government to help fight coronavirus. \u201cMaybe if there had been a better school when I was younger maybe I could have studied more. But it was not the case \u2013 I was in the village. So all the boys there want to play football and no one wants to go to school any more. They just want to be a footballer like me \u2026 But I always tell them to make sure they have to be well educated and go to school. Of course they can keep playing football but it will help you more to be successful in what you are doing if you do both. It\u2019s not like when I was young any more because it was very difficult back then.\u201d Made In Senegal is available from Wednesday for free on Rakuten TV"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
