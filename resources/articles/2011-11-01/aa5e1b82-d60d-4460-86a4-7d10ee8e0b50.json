At first it doesn't look all that special: until, that is, you turn it towards the light, when it glows a deep crimson colour. The feather belongs to one of the most extraordinary creatures I have ever seen: Prince Ruspoli's turaco. Of all the 400 or more species of bird I saw in Ethiopia \u2013 more, incidentally, than I have racked up in a lifetime's birding in Britain \u2013 this curious bird was the most memorable. Not just because of its striking appearance, but also because of its strange history. Prince Ruspoli was a 19th century Italian aristocrat, naturalist and explorer. In the early 1890s he went on an expedition to Ethiopia, to collect new species for science, but unfortunately halfway through his visit he was trampled to death by an elephant. When his collecting bag arrived back in Italy, it contained a colourful, long-tailed bird about the size of a pheasant \u2013 clearly a new species of turaco. But because he had omitted to label the bird with the location where it had been shot, it was impossible to tell where in this vast country it was found. The turaco \u2013 now posthumously bearing the name of its finder \u2013 remained a mystery for another half century. Then, in the 1940s, it was rediscovered in an area of scrubby woodland near the town of Negelle, in the far south of the country. Since then ornithologists have mapped its distribution: just three sites in the same region, making it one of the most restricted in range of all Ethiopia's 33 endemic birds. We caught up with the turaco halfway through our memorable whistle-stop tour. Our leader Steve Rooke has an unrivalled knowledge of Ethiopia's birds, so when he stopped the minibus alongside an unremarkable looking area of habitat we suspected we could find something special. After a few minutes searching, a shout went up and we raced over, binoculars at the ready. And there it was, perched on top of an acacia: a vision of moss-green, with a bizarre blonde punk hairdo, looking remarkably like Chris Packham in his younger days. But the best was yet to come. After calling for a few minutes the turaco took off, opening its wings to reveal deep crimson linings. These rich red and green colours are unique to the world's 18 species of turaco, and derive from special pigments known only from this family of birds. I only returned from Ethiopia a short while ago, but already the wonderful places, birds and other wild animals I saw are fading in my memory. But I still have a vision of this splendid creature, with its strange and poignant history. And if I need reminding of its beauty, I need only to pick up that feather, turn it towards the light, and watch it glow.
