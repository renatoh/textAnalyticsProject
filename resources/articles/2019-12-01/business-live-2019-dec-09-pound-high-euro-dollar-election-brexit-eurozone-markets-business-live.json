The pound broke over \u20ac1.19 against the euro today, for the first time since May 2017. Against the US dollar, it struck $1.318 - its highest level in seven months. But the rally has now faded, as investors wonder whether recent opinion polling can be trusted. While Survation gave Boris Johnson a 14-point lead overnight, ICM\u2019s latest poll have trimmed the PM\u2019s advantage to just 7 points. If ICM are right, Britain could find itself in hung parliament territory again on Friday morning. But if Survation, and YouGov, are on the money then Boris Johnson could sweep back to Downing Street. Investors believe that a chunky Conservative majority would allow Britain to leave the EU in an orderly fashion by 31 January, removing the immediate risk of a cliff-edge exit. But it would also create a fresh deadline at the end of December 2020 for a new trade deal to be signed. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says Sterling now just wants Brexit done, a telling about-face considering the plunge it suffered following 2016\u2019s referendum result, which means the Tories are its favoured party. Its current levels \u2013 7- and 31-month highs against the dollar and euro respectively \u2013 suggest it is confident of a blue majority come Friday morning. It also leaves the currency with plenty of room to fall if Britain produces the latest in a string of electoral upsets. The shadow chancellor has tried to calm worries about a sterling crisis if Labour won a surprise victory. John McDonnell claimed there was more danger of the pound going up.... In other news: Paul Volcker, one of the giants of central banking, has died aged 92. He\u2019s been widely praised for his work tackling America\u2019s inflation problems in the 1970s and 80s Economic confidence across the eurozone has risen this month, to its highest level since the spring. Shares in Africa-focused oil company Tullow have slumped by almost 70%, after it slashed production targets and shed two top executives Over in New York, trading is subdued as investors brace for the next deadline in the US-China trade talks. Washington is due to hike tariffs on $155bn of Chinese goods, including technology products, on 15 December unless a Phase One trade deal is agreed. Many analysts expect a delay, but the uncertainty is worrying Wall Street. So, the Dow is down 31 points or 0.1% in morning trading at 27,984. Here\u2019s AP\u2019s take: Wall Street is particularly focused on developments in the trade war ahead of a new round of tariffs on $160 billion of Chinese imports due to take effect on Sunday. That would raise prices on key products, including cell phones and laptops, and threaten to affect consumers. A Chinese official said Monday that the nation wants a prompt settlement, but gave no details on progress toward a potential deal. China made a conciliatory gesture last week when it said it would waive tariffs on American soybeans and pork. Gains from communications companies were offset by losses from energy and health care stocks. Charter Communications rose 1% and Marathon Petroleum fell 2.5%. Trade war jitters seem to be weighing on European stock markets today. The main indices are mostly in the red as that 15th December deadline looms. Data showing that Chinese exports fell again in November has disappointed some investors, as it implies the trade dispute with America is causing more damage. Duncan Weldon of The Economist points out that Paul Volcker\u2019s long, varied career went beyond simply running the Federal Reserve: Whoever wins Thursday\u2019s election faces many challenges, including how to fight the climate emergency while still raising living standards. Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz reckons this conundrum can be solved, if policymakers focus on the \u2018quality\u2019 of growth in the economy: Back in the UK, another opinion poll has shown that the Conservative\u2019s lead over Labour has narrowed. It shows that Boris Johnson\u2019s lead over Jeremy Corbyn has dipped to 6 percentage points, from 7. That\u2019s a tighter race than other polls in recent days, such as YouGov (a ten-point lead) and Survation (14 points). And it\u2019s weighing on the pound a little - much of this morning\u2019s rally has now fizzled out. Reuters points out that Paul Volcker was no fan of the rise of the super-rich: In 2018 he published a memoir, \u201cKeeping at It: The Quest for Sound Money and Good Government,\u201d and expressed concern about the direction of the federal government and the loss of respect for it. \u201cThe central issue is we\u2019re developing into a plutocracy,\u201d he told the New York Times in October 2018. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that they\u2019re rich because they\u2019re smart and constructive. And they don\u2019t like government and they don\u2019t like to pay taxes.\u201d They also talk about the \u2018mystique\u2019 that underpinned his work at the Fed, as he hiked interest rates painfully high: Volcker stood 6-foot-8 (2.03 meters), smoked cheap cigars, wore old suits and spoke with a rumbling baritone, creating a mystique that intimidated congressmen and even presidents. Part of his aura of power was due to the Fed\u2019s unusual nature - the central bank\u2019s governors, although appointed by the president and overseen by Congress, are effectively answerable to no one. In 2018 when President Donald Trump regularly attacked the Fed as \u201ccrazy\u201d for raising interest rates, Volcker advised Chairman Jerome Powell to simply ignore the criticism. Volcker, who slammed the economy\u2019s brakes like no other Fed chair, also absorbed his share of barbs from lawmakers in the 1980s. But he faced down both that criticism and, ultimately, inflation that had spiked higher than any point since the 1940s. Economists, investors and journalists are offering their appreciations for Paul Volcker\u2019s work: He wasn\u2019t infallible, though.... Newsflash: Paul Volcker, who ran America\u2019s Federal Reserve through much of the 1980s battle against inflation, has died at the age of 92, according to the New York Times. Volcker was one of the most important central bankers to have steered monetary policy in recent decades. He ran the Fed from 1979 to 1987, first under Jimmy Carter and then Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency - a time of surging inflation. Volcker responded with sharply higher interest rates, to drive inflationary pressures down. The NYT says: Paul A. Volcker, who helped shape American economic policy for more than six decades, most notably by leading the Federal Reserve\u2019s brute-force campaign to subdue inflation in the late 1970s and early \u201980s, died on Sunday in New York. He was 92. The death was confirmed by Janice Zima, his daughter. Mr. Volcker, a towering, taciturn and somewhat rumpled figure, arrived in Washington as America\u2019s postwar economic hegemony was beginning to crumble. He would devote his professional life to wrestling with the consequences. As a Treasury Department official under Presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon, Mr. Volcker waged a long, losing struggle to preserve the postwar international monetary system established by the Bretton Woods agreement. The recent rally in the pound is a blow to any hedge funds who have bet against the currency. Speculators have reduced their net short positions on the pound vs the US dollar to $2.44bn in the last week, Reuters is reporting. That\u2019s down from a peak of $7.81bn earlier this year. Jordan Rochester, Nomura\u2019s currency strategist, has predicted that a Tory triumph could push the pound to $1.35 - not seen since May 2018. Rochester says: \u201cSterling can get to $1.34/$1.35 if there is a Conservative victory, then its appreciation will be capped by what the Conservatives have pledged in terms of the spending offered and renewed Breixt uncertainty. The FT has spotted that the cost of insuring against a tumble in the value of the pound has risen. That suggests some investors are nervous about the result of this week\u2019s election, as a hung parliament would probably knock sterling lower. Rupert Thompson, Head of Research at Kingswood, says smaller UK companies could see their shares rally after a Tory win -- which looks probable, but not certain. A Conservative victory is still not a done deal given the scope for significant tactical voting and the poor performance of the polls in recent elections. Indeed, UK equities overall have struggled to build on their burst of outperformance in October as the risk of a No-Deal Brexit faded. Within the UK market, by contrast, the prospect of a Conservative victory and an orderly Brexit departure are being embraced rather more enthusiastically. Mid and small cap stocks have outperformed their large cap counterparts by around 10% and 5% respectively since mid-October, benefiting from their greater exposure to the domestic UK economy. If the Conservatives do end up with a majority, we would see scope for the pound recovering somewhat further to maybe $1.35 and some renewed outperformance by UK equities. Small cap stocks should also outperform further, as valuations continue to look cheap relative to large caps. In other news, the battle for takeaway company Just Eat rumbles on. Amsterdam-listed Prosus has hiked its offer for the FTSE 100 firm, to over \u00a35bn, which rival bidder Takeaway.com has dismissed as \u2018derisory\u2019. Here\u2019s the latest: Gambling site Betfair reports that the odds of a Conservative win have narrowed again today, to its lowest levels since 2017. As chart shows, it\u2019s now a 79% chance (based on wagers) while a hung parliament is roughly 19%. Betfair spokesperson, Katie Baylis explains: When the Election was called in October, no overall majority was odds-on and the Tories had a battle on their hands according to punters, but once Nigel Farage announced his Brexit Party candidates would not oppose in Tory seats, Boris Johnson and his party have seen their odds continue to shorten to the point that today they look almost unbeatable. \u201cBut if there\u2019s one thing that the last few years in British politics have taught us, is that nothing is ever certain and we will be watching those exit polls and first seats very closely when they come in on Thursday night.\u201d Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has denied that the pound would plunge if his party forms the next government. Presenting his fiscal plans in London, McDonnell is asked what his plan is for a sterling crisis (something he said Labour was planning for back in 2017). McDonnell insists that there won\u2019t be a run on the pound, claiming: My fear is that the pound will start to go up because of our investment plans. McDonnell adds that the markets realised that Boris Johnson\u2019s promises are neither \u201ctruth nor implementable\u201d. They are worried about instability, and very fearful about dropping off the edge within a year with a cliff-edge Brexit, he adds. McDonnell also invites us to \u201cexplore the recent history of the pound under the Conservative government\u201d [reminder: it is still around 10% lower than before the EU referendum]. Back to the pound.... and Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada points out that sterling has already largely priced in a Tory victory. That means there might not be much of a rally if Johnson wins a majority....and quite a tumble if he doesn\u2019t. Cole writes: If the UK bookies\u2019 prices are a reasonable guide to market expectations for Thursday\u2019s election, it is hard to see much more upside for GBP on the outcome. Betfair\u2019s prices now imply almost an 80% probability of a Conservative majority government and that rises to 85% including a Conservative minority. At 15%, the probability of a Labour-led government is its lowest since the campaign began Taken together, the weekend\u2019s polls suggest voting intentions have stabilised, with the Conservatives 10% points ahead on the raw data. As the second chart shows, the steady rise in Labour\u2019s share appears to have stalled and their performance is now lagging, relative to the run up to the 2017 election. There is no \u201cblackout\u201d period in the UK, aside from polling day itself, and polls will continue to be published up to Wednesday night. YouGov will update their MRP model at 10:00 GMT tomorrow. Despite the confidence with which markets predict a Conservative victory, there are still several major uncertainties \u2013 turnout (particularly amongst younger voters), potential tactical voting and the large proportion of undecided voters that the polls still show. In another fillip for the eurozone economy, Germany has managed to grow its exports. German exports rose by 1.2% in October, beating gloomy forecasts of a 0.7% decline. Sales to non-EU countries jumped by 4.5%, suggesting a pick-up in the global economy may be helping the euro area. Economists are encouraged by the pick-up in eurozone confidence this month: Just in: Eurozone economic confidence has jumped unexpectedly, in an encouraging signal for the European economy. The monthly gauge of investor morale, from the Sentix research group, rallied to +0.7 from -4.5% last month. That shows that fears of a euro-recession are easing; investors\u2019 expectations have hit their highest level since March 2018. The receding danger of a disorderly hard Brexit may be cheering Europe, along with hopes of a breakthrough in the US-China trade wars. Some stocks could rally if the Conservatives win Thursday\u2019s election, given Labour\u2019s commitment to nationalise parts of the utilities sector. But Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says Brexit uncertainty could still hold the market back: The pound nudged ahead to $1.3162 as the latest polls showed the Conservative Party extending its lead ahead of the General Election later this week. \u201cThe key question for investors is by how much UK shares could bounce on a Tory majority win. This scenario would remove various negative factors which have been weighing on markets such as Labour renationalising transport companies. Yet there is still Brexit to tackle which sustains some level of uncertainty among investors.\u201d Elsewhere in the City, shares in oil producer Tullow are in freefall after announcing its CEO and exploration director had both resigned. The firm also suspended its dividend, and admitted that oil production from two fields in Ghana will be rather lower than expected. Shares have slumped 60% this morning, a quite staggering slump, to 57p - their lowest since 2001. Back in 2012 they were worth \u00a313, when the firm was reporting solid activity in Ghana, Uganda and Kenya. Shares in UK focused companies are strengthening this morning too. Retailers Marks &amp; Spencer (+3%), Next (1%) and Kingfisher (+1.1%) are all among the risers, along with banks such as Lloyds (+0.8%) and RBS (+0.7%). Supermarket chain Tesco is the top riser, up 5%, after announcing it could sell its Thai and Malaysian stores. But the pound\u2019s strength is pulling down some big overseas earners, including drinks firm Diageo (-1%). This means the FTSE 100 has dipped by 10 points in early trading, to 7228. For all the talk of \u2018getting Brexit done\u2019, it\u2019s inevitable that the issue would dominate UK politics in 2020 and beyond. If the UK does leave the EU by the end of January, a new battle to define the future trading relationship between the two sides will break out. Mujtaba Rahman, managing director at Eurasia Group, says Johnson will have some \u201cvery big decisions to make\u201d, about how close to stick to European rules and regulations in return for less friction at the border. The size of any Conservative win would be a crucial factor here. A big majority would free Johnson from having to placate the hard-line Brexiteers on the back benches (and now in his cabinet too). Rahman says there\u2019s little clarity about which way Johnson will pivot (if he remains as PM): Cabinet ministers admit privately they have barely discussed the future relationship question that would loom large once the UK had left the EU on 31 January. \u201cAll the focus has been on the election,\u201d one minister said. \u201cBoris is vague about the EU trade deal.\u201d Whitehall officials believe Johnson would soon have to confront the dilemma May faced: to secure close to frictionless trade needed to protect UK business, he would have to accept more EU regulation than he has been prepared to admit. Johnson\u2019s position is deliberately opaque. He is still in the \u201chave cake and eat it\u201d mode he outlined when May was PM. In effect, he has asked voters to take him on trust, and allow him to sort out the detail after \u201cgetting Brexit done.\u201d He wants a \u201cno tariffs, no quotas\u201d deal with the EU but has not addressed the quid pro quo of regulatory alignment. He has avoided speaking about possible trade-offs in politically sensitive areas such as fishing rights, an inevitable EU demand. He has raised the prospect of a \u201cbuy British\u201d policy and state aid for struggling UK companies, and largely avoided the EU\u2019s demand for a level playing field. If he wins, he will have some very big decisions to make. Time would be very short. Johnson has argued that after securing a withdrawal agreement in three months, he can be confident of landing an EU trade deal by December 2020. An extension of up to two years, set out in the withdrawal agreement, would have to be approved by EU leaders at their summit next June. Brussels officials say December is an \u201cextremely challenging\u201d deadline and predict a trade agreement would take at least three years. Some UK ministers privately predict (and hope for) a fudge: a bare bones deal in some areas\u2014with the details filled in later. There would be a mechanism to allow the UK to diverge, with consequences for its EU market access. Another scenario\u2014more likely if Johnson has a small majority\u2014would be that the bare bones deal is as good as it got. Our morning briefing explains what the parties will be up to today: Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank has warned clients that the Conservative lead has been slightly whittled away in recent days: The weekend polls showed a wide spread of Tory leads from 6pts to 15pts but with the average edging back above 10pts after recently dipping below. A reminder that anything below a 6-7 point lead is around hung parliament territory. The closely-watched MRP opinion poll, released on Sunday, also gives the Conservatives a solid lead of Labour -- with a majority of 38. But... it comes with a warning that many voters are undecided, so that majority could yet evaporate. This chart shows how the pound has rallied against the euro in recent weeks, to this morning\u2019s 31-month high. However, it\u2019s still around 8% weaker than before the EU referendum in 2016. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With three days until polling day, the City is growing increasingly confident that Boris Johnson is heading back to Downing Street with a healthy working majority. Fears of a hung parliament are receding, as the Conservative Party extends its sizeable lead in the opinion polls. This has lifted the pound to a new 31-month high against the euro this morning, touching \u20ac1.19 for the first time since May 2017 (just before the Tory\u2019s lost their majority in a snap election). Sterling is also rallying against the US dollar too, up 0.25% to $1.318 - a seven-month high. The rally comes as pollsters Survation give the Conservatives a 14-point lead over Labour, at 45% of the vote vs 31%. That would surely be enough to guarantee a Conservative majority, who could drive Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit bill through the Commons by January 31st. But elections are unpredictable beasts -- so traders could yet get a nasty shock after the polls close on Thursday night. Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada points out that undecided voters could still swing plenty of seats: There are two main possible outcomes for this week\u2019s election which will shape the UK for possibly decades to come: (1) A Conservative majority government (exit from the EU at end-Jan on terms of Withdrawal Agreement and then still TBD, the free trade agreement that has to be negotiated by the end of the transition period); (2) A hung Parliament that would see a further delay to the UK\u2019s EU exit and potentially a second referendum. Bookies odds show a Tory majority as a near certainty, in line with the steady gap in most (but not all) opinion polls. But there is a historically high number of undecided voters which could affect as many as 80 marginal seats. We will be neutral GBP going into Thursday and look to trade the outcome. The election campaign will continue today across the country, with Labour outlining its plans if it defies the polls and forms the next government.... Also coming up today Asian stock markets have rallied overnight, after last Friday\u2019s US jobs report came in much stronger than expected. Europe is likely to be subdued, though, having ended last week strongly. On the data front, research group Sentix publishes its latest survey of eurozone investor morale. The agenda 9.30am GMT: Eurozone Sentix Investor Confidence survey; expected to fall to -5.3 from -4.5"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
