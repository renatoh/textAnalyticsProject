The 31-year-old is on the verge of becoming one of manager Martin O'Neill's best-ever transfer coups and the playmaker looks like putting his name to a contract in time to make his debut against Rangers on Sunday with the club being hit by injury problems. Juninho's agent Jonathan Hassall said: \"We've been told that Celtic are now handling the situation and everything else. But I believe that everything's sorted now at the Middlesbrough end and he's looking forward to getting up there. I would have thought he'd be up tomorrow.\" A sceptical O'Neill and the Celtic supporters have so far refused to celebrate the signing, but it now looks like finally going through. The Celtic manager has been looking for a big-name playmaker since Lubo Moravcik's departure and the signing of Juninho should also help ease the pain of Henrik Larsson leaving the club for Barcelona in the summer after seven successful years at Parkhead. O'Neill, who pledged to target players at the top end of the transfer market and work his way down, refused to give up on his pursuit of Juninho despite the player initially saying he wanted to fight for his place at the Riverside. But Juninho soon realised that he was not part of Middlesbrough manager Steve McClaren's plans this season and found the lure of the Champions League too tempting to turn his back on. The playmaker is now in line for a high-profile debut against Rangers at Parkhead on Sunday with O'Neill being hit by an injury to Chris Sutton. The Middlesbrough full-back Michael Reiziger is out of today's trip to Fulham after learning he faces six weeks on the sidelines with a shoulder injury. The former Barcelona defender will travel to Switzerland at the weekend to undergo surgery. The club captain Gareth Southgate and fellow central defender Ugo Ehiogu face late fitness tests on knee and back injuries but the striker Mark Viduka is available after completing a two-match ban."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
