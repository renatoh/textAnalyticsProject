During the protests that led to the resignation of Saad Hariri, women were among those chanting, blocking roads and debating the future of the country\u2019s politics. In the most visible instance, a woman was caught on video kicking the armed bodyguard of the education minister, Akram Chehayeb, footage which went viral and became a symbol of defiance. On Wednesday night women took to the streets of Beirut chanting: \u201cOh patriarchal powers, women\u2019s rights are not a footnote\u201d. \u201cLebanese women are not afraid to take their place in the streets,\u201d said Rand Hammoud, a human rights activist in Beirut. \u201cWe weren\u2019t scared when they threw teargas at us, and we won\u2019t be scared when they challenge our right to govern Lebanon\u2019s future. The feminist bloc has always had an important role in Lebanon\u2019s civil society.\u201d Away from the spotlight, women are taking up traditional roles for revolutionary ends. Fayrousa Nasr, 54, from Chouf, about an hour from the capital, used her small kitchen to cook for hundreds of hungry protesters. \u201cThe protesters out on the streets are doing what needs to be done for our country \u2013 they are working day and night to make our dreams come true,\u201d she said. \u201cI needed to do something. No one can just sit back and not help.\u201d With her friends and her husband lending a hand, Nasr spent a whole night last week cooking 200 portions of mujaddara, a traditional Lebanese lentil-based dish. \u201cI have this spirit to help others. I never feel tired because of the joy that it brings me to help. I do this for Lebanon,\u201d she said. With the help of her sister, she also bought tents for protesters occupying the streets in the October chill. \u201cTomorrow I will bring soup to the protesters, it can warm them up and give them vitamins,\u201d she said. Perhaps predictably, there has been a backlash against women participating in political discourse. Some media coverage has sought to trivialise women\u2019s efforts by branding female protesters \u201cpretty faces\u201d in the crowds. Hariri supporters have launched campaigns to stop female activists, journalists and protesters from reporting violence carried out by the authorities throughout Lebanon. Ali Sibai, a consultant at SMEX, a non-governmental organisation that works on issues of digital platforms and human rights, said: \u201cPro-government users have been reporting protesters\u2019 activities online to get their accounts suspended and content removed from social media. This is dangerous because it is a form of rogue censorship of what is happening on the ground. We have dealt with 30 urgent cases throughout the protests, and almost 70% of these regarded women.\u201d Men are also accused of revealing women\u2019s personal details, such as phone numbers, to encourage harassment. In this climate, many hope the protests will lead to reforms of a legal system that many feel enables a culture of discrimination against women in Lebanon. \u201cSexual harassment is not legally defined and criminalised according to international standards. All the laws that deal with marriage, divorce and custody always favour men,\u201d said Hammoud. \u201cThe resignation of the prime minister is not the end. It\u2019s only the beginning to revolutionising the entire unjust system in Lebanon.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
