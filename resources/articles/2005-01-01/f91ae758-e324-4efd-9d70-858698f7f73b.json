It was 1920, and she took to planes in the same way that her sisters took to ponies. She became a pioneering aviator, as a woman and as a flyer who helped open up the Canadian wilderness in the 1930s and 1940s. She completed her private licence in 1933 at the age of 19, and gained her professional qualifications two years later, the first woman west of Toronto to do so. She said that her male instructors and other pilots encouraged her to succeed; only non-pilots put obstacles in her path. With their support, she became the first woman to fly a radio-equipped plane over the Rocky mountains. Just after qualifying in 1935, she met Amelia Earhart while on a trip to California. Earhart was about to embark on the first-ever flight from Mexico to New Jersey, but was keen to discuss with the rookie Fane the possibility of a new Canadian chapter of Earhart's all-female flying organisation, the 99s Club. The plan was abandoned when Fane explained that the few Canadian women pilots were too far apart to make a club viable, let alone be able to connect with their American sisters. Fane moved to Vancouver in 1936 and, discovering to her delight that six other female pilots were based there, set up the chapter. The young women were not at first even allowed entry into airshows as spectators, but soon, as the Flying Seven, they displayed their skills at flying exhibitions. Their specialities were dawn-to-dusk relays and spot landing competitions. One newspaper captioned a photo of Fane as a \"daring young doll in her flying machine\". With the outbreak of the second world war, the Flying Seven offered their services to the Royal Canadian Air Force. They were invited to the RCAF's headquarters in Ottawa in the mistaken belief that they were men. But once there, their hosts retracted the offer, and replaced it with the option of serving their country as cooks instead. Disappointed, the seven flew back to the west coast and decided to help the war effort by using their flying skills in public awareness promotions. They dropped 100,000 leaflets over Vancouver asking for donations to buy a training plane for (male) pilots. They raised enough to purchase eight trainers - and organised a flying school to teach men destined to fly in combat. Fane also worked for Bridge River &amp; Cariboo Airways as a dispatcher and occasional co-pilot. Her boss, Ginger Cootes, was a local legend, famous for his hard drinking and daredevil aerial exploits. Fane picked up his controls on the days when he was \"indisposed\", and she flew to connect isolated communities around British Columbia. In later years, Fane moved into administration, working for Canadian Pacific Airways. She married Keith Rutledge in 1956. They had no children. \u00b7 Margaret Fane Rutledge, pilot, born April 15 1914; died December 2 2004"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
