The main parades in Dublin, Belfast, Cork, Armagh and Limerick have been called off following the Irish government's request that people postpone all non-essential travel to Ireland. Most airlines and ferry companies are waiving cancellation fees and offering to reschedule bookings for a later date. BA and Aer Lingus are offering travel vouchers or alternative travel dates to customers wishing to postpone their trips, while passengers on unrestricted tickets will be entitled to a full refund. Ryanair will only offer refunds to passengers who have paid for changeable tickets. Stena Line is waiving its cancellation fees as a gesture of good will and Irish Ferries says it does not charge a fee for cancellations unless made within two days of travel. 'It's tough because everyone wants to be in Ireland for St Patrick's Day but these are exceptional circumstances,' said Aer Lingus marketing manager Robin Wilson. But for those determined to see in 17 March in true Irish style, it's not too late to fly to one of the many celebrations around the globe. There are still flights available on 16 March to New York (\u00a3196 with Airline Network, 0800 727747), Chicago (\u00a3278 with flynow.com, 0870 444 4744) and Montreal (\u00a3190 with Canadian Journeys, 0870 709 3010). Oh, and there are trains to Birmingham."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
