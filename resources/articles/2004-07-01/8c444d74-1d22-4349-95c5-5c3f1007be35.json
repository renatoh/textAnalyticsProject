Well, yes. Most of it concerns beards that are attached to scientists. Most of those researchers are men. Most of them are British. Why that should be, I don't know. In 1970, the journal Nature published a letter called \"Effects of sexual activity on beard growth in man\". The author's name was suppressed for reasons that may be self-evident. I'll call him here, as Nature did there, \"Anon\". Anon's letter said: \"During the past two years I have had to spend periods of several weeks on a remote island in comparative isolation.\" Anon went on to say that he had measured his beard growth \"by collecting and weighing the shavings from the head of a Philips Philishaver razor after a single shave once every 24 hours\". He learnt two things. First, that during the day or so before he resumed sexual activity, his beard grew much faster. Second, that within a day or two after resuming the festivities, his beard growth slowed. Anon's letter provoked an influx of letters to Nature, from proud men named Hardisty, Huxley, Bullough, Parsons, Goodhart and Cook. All were published under the general heading \"Sexual activity and beard growth\". Hardisty, Huxley, Bullough, Parsons, Goodhart and Cook raised a variety of points, only some of which constitute hair-splitting. Hardisty inquired whether Anon had been shaving more closely whenever a conjugal meeting was imminent. Huxley questioned whether Anon had consistently measured his beard every day at the same time. Bullough delved into the matter of tension exerted by the follicle erector muscle. Parsons offered a helpful hint about measuring the fluid content of the facial skin. Goodhart vented the opinion that Anon \"ought, in the interests of science, to try abstaining from sexual activity during some of his returns to civilisation\". Finally, Cook, who was employed at the Clinic for Nervous Disorders, in London, suggested that \"slight emotional stress may have a stimulating effect on beard growth\". There have been numerous other scientific reports about beards, many of them fully as consequential as Anon's. Of perhaps greater import to bearded men is a series of letters that appeared in 1998 and 1999 in the journal Anaesthesia. A pair of doctors, Ames and Vincent, at the Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead, wrote that: \"Maintaining an airway using a facemask in patients who have beards can be difficult . . . A simple solution to this problem is to wrap cling film repeatedly around the face and head of the unconscious patient.\" This prompted letters from physicians in Sutton Coldfield and Southampton, begging to differ. \u00b7Marc Abrahams is editor of the bimonthly magazine Annals of Improbable Research (www.improbable.com), and organiser of the Ig Nobel Prize"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
