Mohammed Siddique Khan, who carried out the bombing at Edgware Road, can be seen sitting on a bed in his wife's family home and holding his daughter Maryam up to the camera as tells her that what he is doing is \"for the sake of Islam\". He urges his six-month-old daughter to be strong and \"learn to fight', telling her: \"Fighting is good\". The message, which was recorded on November 16 2004 - two days before Khan flew to Pakistan - was yesterday shown to a jury at Kingston crown court, where three men are standing trial accused of helping to plan the attacks on the London transport network in which 52 people were killed. In the footage, Khan, 30, kisses his daughter on the head as he tells her that he is saddened he will miss her growing up. \"Sweetheart, not long to go now. And I'm going to really, really miss you a lot. I'm thinking about it already. Look, I absolutely love you to bits and you have been the happiest thing in my life. You and your mum, absolutely brilliant. \"I don't know what else to say. I just wish I could have been part of your life, especially these growing up - these next months, they're really special with you learning to walk and things. I just so much wanted to be with you but I have to do this thing for our future and it will be for the best, inshallah [God willing], in the long run. That's the most important thing. \"You make plenty of dua [special prayer] for you guys and you've got loads of people to look after you and keep an eye on you. But most importantly I entrust you to Allah and let Allah take care of you. And I am doing what I'm doing for the sake of Islam, not, you know, it's not for materialistic or worldly benefits.\" Neil Flewitt QC, prosecuting, told the court it was clear from the video that Khan did not expect to see his daughter again. Khan flew to Pakistan on November 18 2004 with Shezhad Tanweer, and the prosecution has alleged that he planned to die fighting in Afghanistan but there was a \"change of plan\" during the trip and he subsequently returned to the UK. The video recording is part of a series of items given by Khan's wife, Hasina Patel, to a friend, Faiza Rehman, who handed it to police after the attacks. In another video, made three weeks earlier in October 2004, Khan introduces his daughter to her \"uncles\" - Tanweer and Hasib Hussain, who were also part of the London bombings, and one of the current defendants, Waheed Ali. The men are laughing and relaxing in the lounge of a house. Khan films himself in the mirror while holding his daughter in his arms saying: \"We've got your uncles in the other room so we're going to introduce you to them shortly. Look at your cute little head, you're a bit shy.\" Ali, 24, is standing trial with two other men, Mohammed Shakil, 31, and Sadeer Saleem, 27, accused of conspiring with Khan, Tanweer, Hussain and Jermaine Lindsay to cause explosions between November 2004 and July 2005. All three are alleged to have carried out a two-day reconnaissance mission in London in December 2004, which they deny. There was further footage, the jury was told, not played to the court, in which Khan and his wife were present and Patel can be seen saying: \"There are two minutes left so say your piece.\" Khan replies: \"Maryam my little sweetheart I love you lots and lots. You are my little baby with big fat little feet. Remember me in your duas, I will certainly remember you, and, inshallah, things will work out for the best. Look after your mother, she needs looking after. Maryam be strong, learn to fight - fighting is good. Be mummy's best friend. Take care of mummy - you can both do things together like fighting and stuff.\" The hearing continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
