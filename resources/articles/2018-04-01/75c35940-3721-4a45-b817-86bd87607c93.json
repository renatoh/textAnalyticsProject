The controversial PR tactics of Elon Musk\u2019s car company have been on full display this week as the corporation has worked to publicly blame the victim of a fatal crash involving its autonomous technology. In the three weeks since the death of Walter Huang, 38, whose Tesla Model X crashed while in Autopilot mode in California, the company has repeatedly argued that the victim was at fault, not its nascent technology, and it has openly feuded with US investigators about the release of information. The defensive statements amid the current tragedy and the settlement offer in Lambert\u2019s labor dispute provide a window into the way Musk\u2019s firm has tried to silence critics \u2013 or publicly attack them. It\u2019s a familiar approach in Silicon Valley, where companies work to block bad publicity by keeping complaints out of court and resolving high-profile disputes behind closed doors. But some say the tactics are particularly intense at Tesla, a firm that often receives fawning coverage from the tech press surrounding Musk\u2019s ambitious projects and celebrity status. Lambert, an electrician hired as a production associate in 2015, alleged in a harassment, retaliation and discrimination lawsuit that he was subject to \u201crepeated racist epithets for months\u201d, including \u201cviolent\u201d rhetoric and attacks using the N-word. Last year, Tesla emphatically denied the claims in lengthy statements that sought to cast doubts on Lambert\u2019s character and alleged that his lawyer was engaged in a \u201cmedia blitz in an attempt to create a disingenuous narrative\u201d. Lambert\u2019s attorney, Larry Organ, who has faced repeated criticisms from Tesla surrounding his civil rights litigation, shared the attorney\u2019s settlement email with the Guardian as an example of the corporation\u2019s efforts to stop bad press and silence workers with complaints. The March 2017 email from Maron said if Lambert rejected the settlement and spoke out, \u201cwe will of course point out all of the facts in the attached document\u201d. The document, according to Organ, attacked Lambert\u2019s character. Organ further said Tesla had offered to have Musk meet Lambert as part of a settlement. \u201cTesla is a big corporation, and they feel like they can bully people,\u201d Organ said in an interview. \u201cAnd shut them up with money,\u201d added Navruz Avloni, another attorney representing Lambert. A Tesla spokesperson did not deny the contents of the email, but alleged that Maron was responding to a \u201cbreathtaking\u201d demand for money and threat to go public with a story. The company initially refused to provide a statement, but after publication of this story, a spokesperson said in an email: \u201cThe characterization of this email exchange is misleading.\u201d He added that Organ\u2019s \u201cdemand\u201d was \u201cbeyond extreme and totally unwarranted given the facts of the case, and amounted to extortion, so our general counsel instead proposed a resolution that would actually be fair\u201d. Organ told the Guardian the offer they discussed was just under $1m: \u201cIt seems to me they put a fairly low value on stealing a man\u2019s dignity.\u201d There are numerous examples of highly combative PR and legal strategies by Tesla in the wake of scandal. This week, attorneys for Huang\u2019s family alleged that Tesla\u2019s Autopilot feature was \u201cdefective\u201d and \u201clikely caused Huang\u2019s death\u201d when the car collided into a median. Tesla, however, said it was Huang\u2019s fault: \u201cThe crash happened on a clear day with several hundred feet of visibility ahead, which means that the only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang was not paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so.\u201d Tesla\u2019s statement expressed condolences to the relatives, who gave a television interview about their grief. But the company also said: \u201cThe reason that other families are not on TV is because their loved ones are still alive.\u201d On Thursday, Tesla also went after the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), a US agency that accused the company of improperly releasing information about the crash investigation. \u201cIt\u2019s been clear in our conversations with the NTSB that they\u2019re more concerned with press headlines than actually promoting safety,\u201d Tesla said in a statement announcing it would make an \u201cofficial complaint to Congress\u201d. Tesla has previously attacked the media in response to reporting on discrimination claims. After a female engineer shared her allegations of harassment with the Guardian, Tesla issued lengthy statements criticizing the woman and ultimately fired her, accusing her of pursuing a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d. Tesla has also vehemently denied her underlying claims. Musk has also been personally defensive about claims that his factory is unsafe for workers. After the first fatal crash involving Autopilot in 2016 \u2013 when Tesla\u2019s technology did not prevent a car from colliding with a large white truck \u2013 the company defended its product. The family of that victim, Joshua Brown, eventually released a statement that said \u201cJoshua loved his Tesla\u201d and that the car was not at fault. Paul Grieco, an attorney for Brown family, said this week he couldn\u2019t comment on whether Tesla paid money or had relatives sign any kind of confidentiality agreement. Tesla also declined to comment. \u201cThe parties were able to resolve their disputes amicably,\u201d Grieco said, later adding: \u201cI cannot comment on any of the settlement terms.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
