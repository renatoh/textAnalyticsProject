Two years later, he walked out, owing to a crisis of faith in himself (not discussed terribly thoroughly here), but soon resumed his stellar and tempestuous career in Moscow. He also made a hugely successful viral dance video in the US with photographer and film-maker David LaChapelle, to Hozier\u2019s single Take Me to Church. Early in the film, comparisons are made to Nureyev. Yet Polunin\u2019s face is far from Nureyev\u2019s worldly sensuality. He looks as clear and untroubled as a child. We hear about the rebellious attitude, cocaine, tattoos, etc, but news of his bad behaviour arrives via tabloid stories flashed up on screen. The film itself does not directly inquire, and the issue of Polunin\u2019s romantic life remains untouched \u2013 though I suspect it may well partly hold the key to those uninvestigated crises. There are some touching interviews with his mother, father and grandparents, who all made great sacrifices to send Polunin to ballet school, and some amazing smartphone video of Sergei dancing naked in the snow; the footage of his dancing generally is great. We could have done with more of it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
