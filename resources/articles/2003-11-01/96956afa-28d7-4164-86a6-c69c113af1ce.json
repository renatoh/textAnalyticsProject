Within minutes it was a rutted ruin, its quality no deeper than the surface, just like the visiting team. West Ham may consider themselves worthy of a higher level but their soft underbelly has been rapidly exposed in the Nationwide League. This was their sixth draw in seven league games, the other having been lost despite a 3-0 lead. As he tried to leave after the match Alan Pardew had trouble finding the coach; a victory is proving even more elusive. \"We're desperate to get that win for the gaffer because he's put so much in,\" said the captain Christian Dailly. \"The work ethic's been excellent but we're not quite able to turn the draws into wins. All I can say is that I've been really impressed with everything he's done. Maybe it's going to take us a few weeks before it's actually running perfectly but all the players are really loving it.\" The fans are not and ended the match singing the name of Trevor Brooking, the former caretaker manager. Having dominated the first half they rarely threatened in the second, with the hosts denied several plausible penalty appeals. The win emphasised Watford's growing promise. \"People were saying that we might get relegated but the last six or eight games we've played really well,\" said their captain Neil Cox. \"We're working really hard on the training ground and it's starting to show on the pitch.\" That is one trick that Pardew must soon learn.
