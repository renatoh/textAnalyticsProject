The company confirmed that more than 200 sites across the US will also screen the movie starting Christmas Day. The Interview will be available on Wednesday at 1pm ET on YouTube, Google Play, Xbox and at Sony\u2019s dedicated website, Seetheinterview.com. \u201cIt has always been Sony\u2019s intention to have a national platform on which to release this film,\u201d said Michael Lynton, Sony\u2019s Entertainment\u2019s chairman and CEO. Sony had cancelled the film\u2019s release following threats of violence against cinemagoers. The number of sites is a small proportion of the cinemas that major studio films tend to appear in \u2013 The Hobbit, for example, was screened at more than 3,800 sites this week \u2013 but if successful and incident-free, the the comedy could potentially be rolled out to more screens. President Obama, who previously dismissed the decision to cancel The Interview\u2019s release as a \u201cmistake\u201d, has welcomed Wednesday\u2019s decision. \u201cWith today\u2019s announcements, people can now make their own choices about the film, and that\u2019s how it should be,\u201d Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz said in a statement released by the White House. Meanwhile, the film\u2019s stars James Franco and Seth Rogen took to Twitter to celebrate. But not everyone was happy with Sony\u2019s decision. According to Deadline, US exhibitors are frustrated with the move. Landmark Cinemas said it would not be showing the film, saying it couldn\u2019t accommodate it in a busy festive schedule. It said: \u201cIt would never occur to us not to honour our existing commitments to our distribution partners during one of the busiest times in the year.\u201d Another anonymous source complained that \u201cSony threw theatre owners under the bus last week when they blamed the theatres for pulling the wide release\u201d. Studio heads have contradicted claims by George Clooney that the actor approached them with a petition against Sony\u2019s cancellation of the film. Clooney recently complained that no one signed the petition, aimed at fighting back against the terror threats being made against cinemas for exhibiting the film. He said: \u201cAs we watched one group be completely vilified, nobody stood up. Nobody took that stand. Nobody wanted to be the first to sign on.\u201d Representatives for Disney, 20th Century Fox, Universal, Warner Bros and Lionsgate, plus talent agencies WME and UTA, told the Hollywood Reporter that their executives were never approached by Clooney."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
