Brad Parscale, the manager for Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign, made the statement on Twitter while criticizing the FBI\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. \u201cTime to fire Sessions End the Mueller investigation,\u201d Parscale wrote. \u201cYou can\u2019t obstruct something that was phony against you The IG report gives @realDonaldTrump the truth to end it all.\u201d The \u201cIG report\u201d refers to a review of the FBI\u2019s actions during the 2016 election that was conducted by the justice department\u2019s inspector general, which acts as an independent watchdog. The 500-page report, which was released last week, condemned the former FBI director James Comey for his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, while also criticizing the conduct of individual agents. It did not, however, find evidence to support Trump\u2019s claims that the nation\u2019s top law enforcement agency is biased against him. The report did not wade into special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow, nor did the report draw any conclusions about its validity. The president\u2019s supporters nonetheless seized on text messages exchanged between two FBI employees, who had previously worked on the Russia investigation, that were critical of then candidate Trump. One of those agents, Peter Strzok, was reassigned from Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation last July, shortly after the texts first came to light, while the other, Lisa Page, is no longer at the agency. Parscale did not elaborate on why he believed Sessions should be fired, when reached by the Guardian. A spokesman for Sessions declined to comment. The attorney general has come under intense criticism from the president for recusing himself last year from overseeing the FBI\u2019s investigation, following reports that he held at least two meetings with the former Russian ambassador to the US in the run-up to the November election. The president has increasingly expressed his disdain for Sessions\u2019s recusal while stopping short of firing him. \u201cThe Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff Sessions didn\u2019t tell me he was going to recuse himself,\u201d Trump tweeted earlier this month. \u201cI would have quickly picked someone else. So much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined...and Sessions knew better than most that there was No Collusion!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
