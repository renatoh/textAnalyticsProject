According to the Harlequins flanker his team will be swayed by neither the opposition nor the weather and still have the character and ability to claim this season's title. Murrayfield has rarely been among England's favourite venues, with just one victory achieved in their last four visits and a highest visiting score of just 15 points. With forecasters also predicting damp and blustery conditions, Robshaw is anticipating a \"wet and dirty\" Calcutta Cup experience but believes a touch of adversity brings out the best in his team. The obvious exception was the game against Wales in the Millennium Stadium last year but Robshaw's side have previously won in Dublin, Paris, Edinburgh and Rome and should have beaten France at the Stade de France last Saturday. \"We've been to some pretty hostile environments and if you look at the character of the squad every guy seems to step up in those arenas. It's you against them and you need to make sure you come out on top. When guys see the characters around them and know what these guys are capable of it gives them strength.\" Robshaw is also adamant there will be \"a massive reaction\" to the slightly unfortunate 26-24 defeat in Paris. Not conceding early points is predictably high on his list of priorities. \"We have to make sure we start well. We can't afford to give teams a massive opportunity like that because it takes so much effort to get yourself back into the game. All the guys have been seething a bit, having come so close and played so well. But our game is not judged on performance, it is judged on results. Both us and Scotland have lost our first games and we want to rectify that. I've seen the reaction in training already.\" England also feel more confident about the trip north than they were two years ago when they packed their bags for Murrayfield ahead of Stuart Lancaster's first match in charge as interim coach. \"When we first met up we probably weren't expecting to win certain games. We were a lot more defensive two years ago. I think our attack has come a long way recentlyand I think it showed last weekend. We have a lot more strings to our bow.\" With Lancaster set to name an unchanged lineup, there is also a collective desire to jettison the \"plucky losers\" tag which is threatening to start pursuing them 18 months out from the 2015 Rugby World Cup. \"No one wants to be called that, do they?\" acknowledged Robshaw. \"Everyone wants to be winners. That's why we play the game. We don't want to play well to finish second every time. We've now left ourselves with a lot of work to do but all the guys are up for that. We spoke about what Wales did last year. Of course we need a bit of luck now but there are certain elements in our court still. We need to make sure we control the things we can and not worry about the others.\" Scotland, even so, have a consistent track record of slowing down England at the breakdown and frustrating their attacking ambitions, particularly in poor conditions. The 2000 grand slam-denying contest was a suffocating classic of the genre and the visiting back-row have a very good idea of what awaits. \"It is a very tough environment ... they put a lot of pressure on the breakdown and try and slow you down,\" confirms Robshaw. \"We know it's going to be tough and attritional. Whenever we play Scotland it's always a pretty ferocious game and the rivalry between the two countries adds to that. You can get drawn into things you don't want to do but it's about trying to have a clear head and staying focused. \"We've spoken about being an all-court team and being able to mix it when it's wet and dirty but also being capable of playing an expansive game. If it is going to be a downpour all game we will probably speak about it. You have scenarios in your locker but it's mainly the nines and 10s [who decide]. They're the guys steering the ship round the pitch.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
