Demand for state primary places this September has soared because of a baby boom and the fact that some parents have changed their minds about sending their children to private schools to save money in the recession. But even with the extra classes, schools may not be able to accommodate all those who apply. This means that when they make offers, between March and May, many parents are still likely to miss out on their first-choice school. Kingston upon Thames, in south-west London, is boosting the number of classes for children aged four and five in its primary schools by 10 \u2013 equivalent to 300 children. In September 2011, it will create at least another four classes. This will mean that between 2009 and 2011, the number of places will have risen by 28%. The local authority is about to consult residents about building a new primary school and permanently expanding \"many other\" schools to meet demand. Bristol has had 4,597 applications so far this year \u2013 an increase of 8% on last year. The city is expanding the number of classes for those starting primary school by nine \u2013 the equivalent of 270 extra pupils. Leeds is expanding by almost the same number \u2013 the equivalent of 260 children. Applications are up by 5% on last year and, although the deadline has passed, the local authority expects to receive more before it gives out offers. Cambridgeshire is creating eight more classes for September \u2013 three of which are in the city centre. Brent, in north-west London, is expecting to boost its number of classes by four to accommodate its growing population. Nearby Barnet, in north London, is doing the same with an estimated 120 more pupils starting this September than last. Sheffield has had 164 more applications than this time last year. It is adding only one extra class, but is developing plans for \"wider-scale expansion\" next year. Applications for places in Manchester have risen by the \"low hundreds\" on last year's 5,300. The local authority said it was reviewing whether to expand its number of places. Brighton is expanding by 60 places, the same as it did last year. This is the equivalent of two extra classes. Bromley is consulting on expanding four of its primary schools. The birth rate in England and Wales has risen since 2001 and is the highest since 1991. In 2007, more than 690,000 babies were born. Local authorities said the baby boom, an influx of families to cities and towns and fewer parents opting for private schools had led to a surge in demand for school places. However, in some parts of the country, competition for places is unlikely to be stronger than usual. Hull, Wolverhampton and Lancashire are expecting applications to be down on last year, while Hartlepool and Portsmouth expect figures to be the same as last year. Parents said they were mainly in favour of bigger schools because it meant their children were more likely to learn with peers of the same ability and have a wider group of friends, but that large schools could be daunting for quiet youngsters. One mother, who did not want to be named and whose children attend a school with three classes in each year, said big schools gave \"huge benefits provided the school buildings, infrastructure are properly adapted to cope with the numbers\". She said: \"My children have a huge pool of friends across the three classes, as every couple of years the classes are reorganised, at which point they make new friends as well as keeping old ones. \"From a teaching point of view, it means children can be divided for maths and literacy based on ability.\" The government has invested \u00a3300m this year to provide new primary places in parts of the country with shortages. Vernon Coaker, the schools minister, said: \"It is a matter for local authorities to make sure there are sufficient school places available to meet parental demand. \"We are aware of the continuing pressure that some authorities will continue to face with growing numbers of primary pupils for several years and this will be an important consideration for the next spending review in 2011.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
