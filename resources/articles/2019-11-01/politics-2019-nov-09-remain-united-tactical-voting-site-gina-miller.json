The Remain United site, led by businesswoman Gina Miller, who led the case against the government\u2019s suspension of parliament, will make recommendations in constituencies where it believes tactical voting will make a difference. However, while tactical voting could play a key role in shaping the result of a volatile election, there are already concerns that the three sites disagree on which party voters should back in dozens of seats around the country. Under current plans, Miller\u2019s site will back about 50 Liberal Democrat candidates. Another major site already up and running, run by the Best for Britain campaign, recommends about 180 Lib Dems. Remain United\u2019s model suggests that the Lib Dems are likely to win only 33 seats if there is a significant tactical voting drive. A third site, run by the People\u2019s Vote campaign, also launched this weekend with its own set of recommendations. Miller told the Observer that she had tried to see if pro-Remain campaigns could recommend one tactical voting site, but it had not proved possible. She said that her recommendations were based \u201cpurely on the data\u201d and that the recommendations would be updated as the campaign progressed. \u201cIf we don\u2019t tactical vote, what we will end up with is a Tory majority that is going to pursue a Brexit plan that is no longer theoretical,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt is not as though we don\u2019t know what is going to happen. We know the direction of travel. If you look through the withdrawal agreement, it significantly shifts accountability. Executive power increases, while parliamentary scrutiny decreases. \u201cWhat is going to upset a lot of parties is that we have no emotional attachment. This is going to be driven by the data and the results are quite different to the results out there already. I can foresee the Lib Dem seats going up [by] a handful, but it\u2019s not going to be anything particularly dramatic. \u201cOur research is showing that between 45% and 55% are going to vote tactically. We\u2019re starting from a different place to the 2017 election. But you can\u2019t just go on past polling data or down party lines. We\u2019ve used as many layers as possible.\u201d Naomi Smith, chief executive of Best for Britain, said electoral law made cooperation hard. \u201cThere are very strict rules under electoral law, which restrict campaigns from working jointly. But there\u2019s also a question of data. We are a data-driven campaign, and we\u2019ve used the latest and best seat-level data to make recommendations. High-quality data is expensive and understanding it is extremely time-consuming, requiring hard work from a committed team. Inevitably, it upsets people in the different parties, including some of our friends. But we know this is our best shot at stopping Boris Johnson and the damaging Brexit he wants for our country.\u201d Miller is going to publish both her site\u2019s methodology and data, to ensure as much transparency as possible. Her site\u2019s research suggests that the Tories are currently on course to win a majority, with 347 seats. However, it says that, with a tactical voting drive, a narrow majority for a coalition of Labour, Lib Dems and the SNP could deliver a second referendum. Her model \u2013 which uses polling that is then combined with demographic data and past voting to come up with recommendations \u2013 suggests tactical voting could reduce the Tories to 309 seats, with Labour on 233 and the Lib Dems on 33 seats. The People\u2019s Vote campaign has been plagued by internal splits and a boardroom battle for control in recent weeks. Its site\u2019s recommendations are based on analysis of private and public polling data, along with information from election results at all levels going back several years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
