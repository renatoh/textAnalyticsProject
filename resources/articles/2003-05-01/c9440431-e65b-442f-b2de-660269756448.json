Occasionally there are uncomically suspenseful chapter endings, such as in chapter 14, which concludes with Dixon and Christine walking \"into the darkness\" towards the Welches' house. They do not know what they will find; we do not know if romance will be consummated. More often, narrative uncertainty is comic befuddlement, as at the end of the chapter before Dixon's disastrous lecture. \"Dixon found that he felt rather drunk.\" The next chapter begins only a moment later, measured by the clock, but in the space between chapters we can sense the wonderfully ominous influence of all the booze. Often the space at the end of the chapter is where the realisation of some terrible new reality must sink in to the mind of Amis's protagonist. Thus the ending of chapter 1, which sets up the comic catastrophe 20 chapters later. Dixon has just been invited by Professor Welch to give the public lecture at the college open week at the end of the term. It seems an honour, even a sign of good things to come. Not knowing what else to say, Dixon accepts, only to hear Welch's horrible stipulation of its subject matter. \"I thought something like 'Merrie England' might do as a subject. Not too academic, and not too... not too... Do you think you could get something together along those sort of lines?\" And there we end. We do not hear Dixon's reply, which is appropriate enough, as Welch, despite his bumbling delivery and pretended hesitation, is giving an order rather than hazarding an idea. We are left, as Amis's hero is left, to ponder the awfulness of Welch's \"merrie\" task, which will hang over Dixon for much of the novel. Amis often uses the break both ways. Turn the page to the opening of chapter 2, and someone is speaking. \"And then, just before I went under, I suddenly stopped caring.\" For a moment we might be disoriented. Who is speaking? What is going on? \"I'd been clutching the empty bottle like grim death, I remember, as if I were holding on to life, in a way.\" Gradually it will dawn on us that this is Margaret, the woman who has somehow become Dixon's girlfriend, and that she is in fact chatting to him (in a public bar) about her recent suicide attempt. \"It's a good sign that you're able to talk about it like this,\" he says, meaning, we suppose, something like the opposite. From the end of one chapter to the beginning of the next we skip from one comically appalling conversation to another. For Dixon, it is as if his life is like that. The great thing is that Dixon does not just suffer, he is also to blame. The ending of chapter 2 beautifully enacts his cowardice and fatalism. In the lavatory at the hotel where he has met Margaret for a drink, he imagines leaving her and the university. Now is the moment to flee. \"But economic necessity and the call of pity were a strong combination; topped up by fear, as both were, they were invincible. He went back through the polished door into the Oak Lounge.\" There we temporarily end. We do not need any more of the conversation. Placed at the chapter's end, the re-entrance into the bar signals Dixon's acceptance of his unwanted fate. There's no escaping the Oak Lounge. A chapter later and the chapter ending lets us share Dixon's unheroic self-knowledge. He has brought Margaret a present, \"a small book of verse, by a contemporary poet he privately thought very nasty\". He feels cheery. The gift will seem both affectionate and flattering. \"A routine qualm gave him trouble at the thought of what he'd written on the fly-leaf, but his mood enabled him to suppress it.\" We are never told with what disingenuous endearment he has inscribed the book. The chapter ending banishes the thought, just as Dixon manages to suppress the guilty knowledge of his dishonesty. He is, we presume, well able to defeat a mere \"routine qualm\". As at the end of most of Lucky Jim's chapters, you can imagine the truth. \u00b7 Have your say about Lucky Jim on the Guardian talkboards or write to The Review, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
