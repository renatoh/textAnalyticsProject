City lost 1-0 at Bayern Munich in their Group E opener before Tuesday evening\u2019s disappointing display at the Etihad Stadium. Now Pellegrini\u2019s side are playing catch-up, starting with the trip to play CSKA Moscow on 21 October. The Chilean\u2019s stock is high at the club after he won the Premier League and Capital One Cup and took City into the Champions League knockout stage for the first time in his debut campaign before they lost to Barcelona in the last 16. While City are realistic in their ambitions for the competition, the hope this term is for progress, which means reaching the quarter-finals at least. There is still a firm belief that City can emerge from the group. After the visit to Moscow, they host CSKA on 5 November and Bayern on 25 November before the potentially crucial final game at Roma on 10 December. From next season City\u2019s aim is to become an established semi-final club over the following five years. The strategy is to reach that stage of the Champions League on at least four occasions during that time span, the thinking being that, on the law of averages, they could expect to win the trophy. City\u2019s away game against CSKA could be played behind closed doors with Uefa set to rule on the disturbances involving the Russian club\u2019s fans at Roma a fortnight ago. Supporters were barred from Tuesday\u2019s 1-0 home defeat by Bayern as punishment for the crowd\u2019s behaviour during the visit of Viktoria Plzen in last season\u2019s group stage. CSKA\u2019s general manager, Roman Babaev, said at the weekend: \u201cIt is likely we will have to play all our home games behind closed doors. They [Uefa] could exclude us from the Champions League. We are going to do everything in our power to make sure this does not happen. At the moment the whole club is going through a difficult time.\u201d Vincent Kompany has urged his team-mates to pick up six points from the two games against CSKA. The City captain said: \u201cWe have to make sure we learn something from this \u2013 and we owe a better performance in the next game. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more difficult or special about the Champions League \u2013 but you need to be at your best, like in any game in the Premier League. The [style of] game play is always pretty much the same \u2013 it\u2019s very difficult playing against Roma [as is] playing one of the top six sides in England. It\u2019s actually very similar. \u201cIt could go any way really. Roma have to play Bayern now and one of the teams will lose points \u2013 if my maths are correct. And that will probably leave us with an opportunity to get closer again. We have to win both of those games. But doing so will open up the door for not just second place but first place as well. It\u2019s going to be close.\u201d City are confident there will be no problem filling the Etihad after the planned expansion to 55,000 seats. There were only 37,509 at the Roma game on Tuesday, around 6,000 fewer than the club\u2019s average for a Champions League match and 8,000 below the Premier League number. Rio Ferdinand, the former Manchester United captain, questioned the club\u2019s plans. \u201cExpanding the stadium for what though?? For who though???\u201d he tweeted. Yet with the waiting list for season tickets about 8,000 and the club selling out every home Premier League match, there is no concern that City will have trouble filling the stadium once it can house 55,000 fans."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
