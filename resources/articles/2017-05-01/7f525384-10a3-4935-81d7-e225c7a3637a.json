Harvey gave a contrite press conference at Citi Field in which he admitted to being \u201cextremely embarrassed\u201d by failing to show for the game against the Marlins \u2013 a no-show that led to the club imposing a three-match suspension on the 28-year-old. He confirmed he had been partying with friends on Friday and said he had put himself \u201cin a bad place to be ready to show up for a ballgame\u201d. Harvey said: \u201cFirst off, as I just did with my team-mates and all the coaches, I apologised for my actions and I do apologise for my actions. Obviously I\u2019m extremely embarrassed by my actions.\u201d He went on: \u201cYes, I was out on Friday night, past curfew. I did play golf Saturday morning and I put myself in a bad place to be ready to show up for a ballgame. It is my responsibility and I take full blame for that.\u201d According to reports, Harvey failed to turn up for batting practice on Saturday afternoon. He said he had a migraine. Team personnel were reportedly sent to his Manhattan apartment at about 10pm on Saturday night. When he arrived on Sunday for what would have been his turn in the rotation, Harvey was told he was suspended for three games, retroactive to Saturday. Harvey said he had taken on board the lessons of the weekend. He said: \u201cPeople make mistakes, and there are things I have realized the last couple days \u2026 and one of those should be doing is putting myself in a better place to perform physically.\u201d Harvey was asked whether he would file a grievance. \u201cI\u2019ve been more embarrassed about my actions and thinking about the team more than anything. Filing anything \u2013 I have not done [that]. Whether or not it happens down the road isn\u2019t on my mind.\u201d Harvey, who was supposed to start Sunday\u2019s game, is now set to make his next start on Friday in Milwaukee. He said: \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to getting everything back on track and helping this organization moving forward said. They have my word on that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
