Maki, a 21-year-old male lemur, was discovered missing on Wednesday morning, shortly before the zoo opened to visitors. Police found evidence of a forced entry to the enclosure. On Thursday evening, witnesses spotted what they believed to be Maki at a playground in Daly City, a few miles south of the zoo. They alerted the authorities, who quickly responded, San Francisco police said. \u201cWe contained him until staff from the zoo took him back home,\u201d Daly City police tweeted. The lemur was \u201cpositively identified\u201d to be Maki and was in good health, San Francisco police said. SFPD on Friday afternoon said they arrested a suspect in the burglary \u2013 or kidnapping, as it has been called on the Twitter account created for the character Maki the Lemur. The department said it had reason to believe a 30-year-old man who was arrested on an unrelated matter was connected to the incident. This was not the first time an elderly animal was taken from the San Francisco zoo. In 2011, \u201cBanana Sam\u201d \u2013 a 17-year-old squirrel monkey, was taken from his cage before being found \u201chungry, trembling and thirsty\u201d in a nearby park a few days later. As with most mishaps and misadventures in San Francisco, someone made him his own Twitter account and took to tweeting his time away from the zoo. Banana Sam died two years later. In 2000, two teenagers were arrested for stealing two koalas \u2013 seven-year-old Leanne and her mother, Pat, 15 \u2013 from the zoo. The two koalas, described as \u201cthe cutest things you have ever seen\u201d, were found safely playing at the teenagers\u2019 home. UPDATE: this story has been updated to reflect that the San Francisco police department have made an arrest in the case."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
