Mr Saban - the Hollywood-based mogul behind the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers - submitted his bid by last night's deadline. He is understood to be \"seriously interested\" in Hollinger International, which also owns the Chicago Sun-Times and Jerusalem Post. The veteran deal maker, who made his fortune by selling his stake in the Fox Family Network to Disney in 2001, has made no secret of his ambition to buy media assets. Mr Saban made headlines in this country last year when he attended the Royal Television Society biennial conference in Cambridge and complained about alleged anti-Israeli bias in UK TV news. \"Europe in general, is very unbalanced [in its coverage of Israel],\" said Mr Saban, who was born in Egypt, raised in Israel and made his fortune in American TV. Launching an attack on Sky News he said: \"I was watching a piece on Sky... at 6am that described for about 10 minutes Hamas - by the time the piece was done, I went for my chequebook to write [out a donation] then I remembered the five-year-old girl who had died because there were too many nails in her. Her sister survived.\" He added: \"That piece on Sky was really glorifying the philanthropic and educational activities Hamas are [involved in]. Not once was the word terrorism used.\" Mr Saban said his company, worth \u00a36bn, was too big to be involved in what he called \"small deals\" and the number of opportunities which came along in Europe to buy a market leader were rare. He also made plain that he was interested in buying more media businesses, claiming he had billions at his disposal through a combination of personal wealth and institutional backers. It is not clear whether he has his eye on all or some of Hollinger's titles, but Mr Saban's passionate views on Israel suggest he would be keen to buy into a position of influence in the British media. The Jerusalem Post, although a small part of Hollinger's business, could also be an added attraction for the Israeli mogul. He made his mark in European broadcasting last year by acquiring ProSiebenSat.1, Germany's second largest commercial broadcaster. He also remains interested in ITV but has been put off by the company's rising share price since the Carlton-Granada merger was cleared in October. Hollinger's business straddles north America and Europe, which could appeal to Mr Saban more than other bidders, who are mainly focusing on just some of its assets. Investment bank Lazard has invited bids for all of Hollinger or for just some of its assets. It is thought Hollinger may prefer to sell the company as a whole to avoid potential tax liabilities. Bidders include the Barclay brothers, owners of the Scotsman, whose attempt to take control of the Telegraph from outgoing proprietor Conrad Black was thwarted in a US court last month. Sir David Barclay has said he and his brother Sir Frederick are only interested in the Telegraph titles - the Daily Telegraph, Sunday Telegraph and the Spectator. The Express owner, Richard Desmond, and his arch-rivals at the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust, which has teamed up with private equity group Cinven, have also made offers for the Telegraph. Private equity group 3i - which is advised by former Mirror boss David Montgomery - has put in what it describes as a \"strong bid\" for the group. Apax partners, where former Telegraph executive Stephen Grabiner is a partner, is another venture capital firm believed to be in the frame. German publisher Axel Springer is thought to be interested, while US press giant Gannett, which owns the Newsquest regional group and Glasgow's Herald newspaper group, has said it is \"looking at the books\". Canadian media company CanWest has also indicated an interest. The company's chief executive, Leonard Asper, has said he would be \"taking a look at those papers\". Tribune group, the owner of the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune, has submitted a bid, according to US press reports. Lazard today declined to comment on how many bids it had received. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
