In addition to his novels and poetry he also wrote, almost 20 years ago, a superb book about the 1981 World Poker Series called The Biggest Game In Town . This is essentially a reprise of that book - in fact, it contains whole recycled chunks of it - demanding the question, why now? The answer lies in the packaging: here we have a coffee-table book with lavish prints and some singularly ill-judged \"modish\" typography. The fact is that poker has itself become modish - or at least that publishers think they can make money out of it - and this is an attempted cash-in on the new (if unconvincing) gambling zeitgeist. Loads of people have been roped into this, probably including me, but the worst ones are a new breed of nouveau poker players, often journalists on the fringes of the literary mafia, who actively flaunt their gambling selves and really seem to think of themselves as winners. I would not include Alvarez in this coterie. He is determinedly, if somewhat self-consciously, old-school. Yet personally I have never seen poker as proper gambling because a) there are real, surmountable odds that the right, sensible mind can oversee profitably; and b) it is not the robotic, evil house or bookie that you are fighting and attempting to fleece, but real humans you are attempting cunningly to outwit. A rather malicious activity, then, when compared to the doomed, deluded gambling aesthetic to which the rest of us succumb; in fact, rather like real life, or a job. I am not saying that proper gamblers bet only to lose - that is another self-conscious psychological tic that some people like to flaunt - but that there is a certain reckoning of likely defeat that goes along with the determination to enjoy the occasional big win when it comes: to splurge it all, to chuck it away joyously until it is gone, just for the . . . respite. But poker players don't seem to think like that. To me they have always seemed colder than other gamblers, and also to view their gambling, inappropriately, as an extension of their workaday worth rather than an inglorious escape from it. It's clear from Alvarez's introduction that he knows this: \"Poker isn't about gambling,\" he writes, but then, \"I've never much cared for gambling.\" Poker is about \"discipline and calculation\", whereas \"to bet on horses, the dogs . . . is at worst an addiction, at best a romantic weakness. You have to believe in your luck, in your special relationship with fate, in the possibility that you are somehow chosen and blessed. Against all the evidence, you have to be an optimist.\" His conclusion: \"Optimism has never been my strong suit.\" I disagree: it is poker players who seem to me to be the optimists, and often with good reason, because they are usually sober and organised. Other gamblers, on the contrary, are utterly disorganised, possessed by a drink-fuelled defiance but also an informed pessimism that reins them in just enough, enabling them to continue gambling. The frustrating thing is that Alvarez, having initially identified these facets of the poker player, then spends the rest of the book contradicting his findings with a mixture of romanticised sentimentalism about \"poker men\" shored up by a transparent veneration for the American vernacular that lovingly, if vacuously, pervades poker terminology. He does it a lot better than most Englishmen - or, now, women - but Americans do it best; even then it is rather fake, because the language has always overcomplimented the barren and banal reality. Crucially, Alvarez's template for the American gambling scene seems stuck in the 1970s, when places like Las Vegas and Reno probably were still quite glamorous in a tawdry and fallen sort of way. But now they have been braced by Wall Street; they rely on slot machines for the bottom line, and the retro poker book is simply a minor marketing boost to the heritage industry and state coffers, which rely on gambling taxes to an unimagined degree. So why has poker, with its peculiar brand of self-mythologising and now unisex \"manliness\", come back? The reason is the same as first time around: television. It was films shown on TV that first masqueraded the idea of these heroic Western bluffers, when in fact, if you've ever been to a casino poker game, you'll know that 99.9% only play if they've got good cards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
