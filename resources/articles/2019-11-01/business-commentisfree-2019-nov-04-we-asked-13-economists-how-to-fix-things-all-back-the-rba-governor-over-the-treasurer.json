All back the RBA governor over the treasurer", "bodyText": "Thirteen leading economists have declared their hands in the standoff between the government and the governor of the Reserve Bank over the best way to boost the economy. All 13 back the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe. They say that, by itself, the Reserve Bank cannot be expected to do everything extra that will be needed to boost the economy. All think that extra stimulus will be needed, and all think it\u2019ll have to come from the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, as well as the bank. All but two say the treasurer should be prepared to sacrifice his goal of an immediate budget surplus in order to provide it. The 13 are members of the 20-person economic forecasting panel assembled by the Conversation at the start of this year. All but one have been surprised by the extent of the economic slowdown. The 13 represent 10 universities in five states. Among them are macroeconomists; economic modellers; former Treasury, IMF, OECD and Reserve Bank officials; and a former government minister. The central bank needs help At issue is the government\u2019s contention, spelled out by Frydenberg\u2019s Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, in evidence to the Senate last month, that there is usually little role for government spending and tax (\u201cfiscal\u201d) measures in stimulating the economy in the event of a downturn. Absent a crisis, economic weakness was \u201cbest responded to by monetary policy\u201d. Monetary policy \u2013 the adjustment of interest rates by the Reserve Bank \u2013 is nearing the end of its effectiveness in its present form. The bank has already cut its cash rate to close to zero (0.75%) and will consider another cut on Tuesday. It is preparing to consider so-called \u201cunconventional\u201d measures, including buying bonds in order to force longer-term interest rates down towards zero. Governor Lowe has made the case for \u201cfiscal support, including through spending on infrastructure\u201d saying there are limits to what monetary policy can achieve. The 13 economists unanimously back the governor. Seven of the 13 say what is needed most is fiscal stimulus (including extra government spending on infrastructure), three say both fiscal and monetary measures are needed, and three want government \u201cstructural reform\u201d, including measures to help the economy deal with climate change and remove red tape. None say the Reserve Bank should be left to fight the downturn by itself without further help from the government. Mark Crosby, Monash University: \u201cThere is plenty of room for fiscal stimulus, particularly infrastructure spending.\u201d Ross Guest, Griffith University: \u201cI agree with the emerging consensus that monetary policy is no longer effective when interest rates are so low.\u201d Guay Lim, Melbourne Institute: \u201cIt is time for coordinated monetary and fiscal policies to boost domestic demand.\u201d The surplus can wait Eleven of the 13 believe the government should abandon its determination to deliver a budget surplus in 2019-20. The economic modeller Renee Fry-McKibbin says the government should \u201cease its position of a surplus at all costs\u201d. The former Treasury and ANZ economist Warren Hogan says achieving a surplus in the current environment would have \u201czero value\u201d. The former OECD director Adrian Blundell-Wignall says that rather than aiming for an overall budget surplus, the government should aim instead for an \u201cnet operating balance\u201d, a proposal that was put forward by Scott Morrison as treasurer in 2017. The approach would move worthwhile infrastructure spending and borrowing onto a separate balance sheet that would not need to balance. Political debate would focus instead on whether the annual operating budget was balanced or in deficit. The former Treasury and IMF economist Tony Makin is one of only two economists surveyed who back the government\u2019s continued pursuit of a surplus, saying annual interest payments on government debt have reached $14 billion, \u201cfour times the foreign aid budget and almost twice as much as federal spending on higher education\u201d. Further deterioration of the balance via \u201cfacile fiscal stimulus\u201d would risk Australia\u2019s creditworthiness. However, Makin doesn\u2019t think the government should leave everything to the Reserve Bank. He has put forward a program of extra spending on infrastructure projects that meet rigorous criteria, along with company tax cuts or investment allowances paid for by government spending cuts. The former trade minister Craig Emerson also wants an investment allowance, suggesting businesses should be able to immediately deduct 20% of eligible spending. It\u2019s an idea put forward by Labor during the 2019 election campaign. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has indicated something like it is being considered for the 2020 budget. Emerson says it should be possible to deliver both the investment allowance and a budget surplus. Quantitative easing would be a worry Five of the 13 economists are concerned about the Reserve Bank adopting so-called \u201cunconventional\u201d measures such as buying government and private sector bonds in order to push long-term interest rates down towards zero, a practice known as quantitative easing. Jeffrey Sheen and Renee Fry-McKibbin say it should be kept in reserve for emergencies. Adrian Blundell-Wignall and Mark Crosby say it hasn\u2019t worked in the countries that have tried it. Adrian Blundell-Wignall: \u201cA quantitative easing avalanche policy by the European central bank larger than the entire UK economy has left inflation below target and growth fading. Quantitative easing destroys the interbank market, underprices risk, and encourages leverage and asset speculation.\u201d Steve Keen says in both Europe and the United States quantitative easing enriched banks and drove up asset prices but did little to boost consumer spending \u201cbecause the rich don\u2019t consume much of the wealth\u201d. The treasurer should step up Taken together, the responses of the 13 economists suggest it is ultimately the government\u2019s responsibility to ensure the economy doesn\u2019t weaken any further, and that it would be especially unwise to palm it off on to the Reserve Bank at a time when the bank\u2019s cash rate is close to zero and the effectiveness of the unconventional measures it might adopt is in doubt. Measures the government could adopt include increasing the rate of the Newstart unemployment benefit, boosting funding for schools and skills training, borrowing for well-chosen infrastructure projects with a social rate of return greater than the cost of borrowing, further tax cuts that double as tax reform (including further tax breaks for business investment), and spending more on programs aimed at avoiding the worst of climate change and adapting to it. The economists are backing the governor in his plea for help. They think he needs it.
