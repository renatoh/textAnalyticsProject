Last winter saw the death of six holidaymakers and nine French guides - which is twice the long-term average for guides. Many of the deaths were well-known professionals in the French mountaineering community, among them Alain Geloen, who guided Georgina Henry, deputy editor of the Guardian, along the Haute Route for a piece featured in Escape last January. This season there have already been nine deaths in the Savoie region alone, fuelling fears of an ongoing trend. David George, manager of Piste Hors (pistehors.com), which provides information and advice on skiing off-piste, says extra pressure on guides to provide more exhilarating experiences for their clients may be partly to blame for them taking more risks. 'Some guides feel they have been pushed into dangerous decisions by the PlayStation generation, brought up on a diet of adrenaline-charged extreme sports,' he said. France has no specific laws controlling off-piste skiing, though mayors of some resorts have brought in bylaws forbidding going off-piste when there is a high risk of avalanche. But the death of four snowboarders who chose to ignore warnings in the Pyrenean resort of Bar\u00e8ges last month - a resort with such a bylaw - shows how difficult such a law is to police. The French guides' union suggests group sizes be limited. Other suggestions include access gates at entry points to off-piste areas that would only allow through those with avalanche gear. 'Anyone who is going skiing or climbing should be honest with themselves about their skills and fitness,' said George."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
