O'Sullivan is hoping to win his fifth UK title, Higgins his third. \"I've always regarded Ronnie as the marker to set myself against,\" said the reigning world champion. Higgins trails their personal head-to-head 28-19 but is well clear of his rival at the top of the provisional world rankings. Through frame-clinching breaks of 66 and 75, Ding led 2-1 but missed on 31-0 in the fourth to let Maguire in for a 97. From 2-2 Ding, the 2005 UK champion, opened a three-frame gap before Maguire dominated the last frame of the afternoon. On the resumption Ding obtained the snooker he needed on the late colours in both the first and second frames of the evening only for Maguire to take one with a fine cut of a length-of-the-table black and the other by fluking the blue as he levelled at 5-5. Utterly unperturbed, Ding completed a 134 total clearance to initiate a four-frame winning streak to the line, which he concluded with a run of 69. \"I just wasn't firing. I can play a lot better than that,\" said Maguire, who had been hoping to repeat his UK triumph of 2004. Ding, 22, has been China's top player since he won the world under-21 title at the age of 15 but has had to respond to a growing threat to his domestic pre-eminence from Liang Wenbo, the likely recipient of the discretionary wild card for next month's Masters at Wembley on the grounds of reaching the final of September's Shanghai Masters and the quarter-finals here. Ding and Liang do not practise together any more. It also seems that Ding, aftertwo fallow years, has learnt how to shoulder the immense weight of national expectation he has to bear. His profile is within the top half-dozen Chinese sportsmen. With prize money on offer of \u00a323,250 for the losing semi-finalists and \u00a346,000 for the runner-up, the champion's cheque for \u00a3100,000 is to be supplemented, courtesy of the sponsors, with his weight in Pukka Pies. At the weigh-in Ding scaled 69 kg (276 pies), Higgins and O'Sullivan 80kg (320 each) and Maguire 89 kg (356). The game's followers could only speculate on what the sponsor's potential pie liability would have been for the circuit's heavyweight champion, Stephen Lee, a second-round loser here. The generously proportioned comedienne Jo Brand once described him as \"the sort of bloke I'd like to have a meal with\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
