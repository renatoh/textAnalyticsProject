A high court judge, Mr Justice Hilliard, has granted permission for lawyers representing the former Brexit secretary David Davis, the Labour politician Dan Jarvis and the human rights organisation Reprieve to launch a judicial review of the government\u2019s decision in July not to examine extraordinary rendition claims. Calls for a judge-led investigation were reinforced after parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee (ISC) published a damning indictment in 2018 of the role played by the overseas agency MI6 and the domestic service MI5, which were said to have been involved in hundreds of torture cases and scores of rendition cases. The ISC reports said the intelligence agencies had been aware \u201cat an early point\u201d of the mistreatment of detainees by the US and others. There were two cases in which UK personnel were \u201cparty to mistreatment administered by others\u201d. One key passage in the report said MI6 had \u201csought and obtained authorisation from the foreign secretary\u201d for the costs of funding a plane involved in an individual rendition case. It also found that in 232 cases UK personnel had continued to supply questions or intelligence to other services despite knowledge or suspicion of mistreatment. Jarvis, Davis and Reprieve began legal action after it was announced during the last days of Theresa May\u2019s premiership: \u201cThe government has decided that it is not necessary to establish a further inquiry. There is no policy reason to do so, given the extensive work already undertaken to improve policies and practices in this area.\u201d Granting permission for judicial review in a judgment last week, Hilliard noted: \u201cThe ISC has said \u2026 it was essential to hear from witnesses if the inquiry was to be thorough and comprehensive and in a position to reach properly considered, balanced and fair views about the facts. In the event, witnesses were not made available. \u201cThe argument for an unmet investigative obligation emerges from the history of previous investigations which were not completed. It is, I think, properly arguable that witness testimony is particularly important where records may not tell the full story and that systemic failings may not be satisfactorily identified in separate proceedings initiated by individuals. \u201cAlthough some lessons have undoubtedly been learned and improvements made, it is open to argument whether all the necessary lessons can have been learned if the facts have not been fully established.\u201d Welcoming the judgment, Davis, who is standing for re-election, said: \u201cThis is an excellent result. The court recognised in terms of our argument that on the question of torture and rendition we cannot be certain that all the necessary lessons have been learned without a proper and full investigation of the facts.\u201d Maya Foa, director of Reprieve, said: \u201cWe are very pleased the court has found that the government has a case to answer over its failure to properly investigate \u2018war on terror\u2019-era torture and rendition. When the government broke its promise to survivors of torture, it also broke the law. The powerful must be held to account so that victims can move on with their lives, but just as importantly because if we do not fully investigate our past mistakes, we are doomed to repeat them.\u201d In May last year, the government gave an unprecedented public apology to two people, Abdul-Hakim Belhaj and Fatima Boudchar, for British involvement in their rendition to be tortured in Libya."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
