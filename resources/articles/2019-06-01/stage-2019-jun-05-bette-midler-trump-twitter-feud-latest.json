Bette Midler and Trump revive feud", "bodyText": "Even from a distance there is no harmony between Bette Midler and Donald Trump. Regular foes on social media, the music legend and the American president sparred again this week during Trump\u2019s flashy state visit to Britain. The US commander in chief called Midler a \u201cwashed up psycho\u201d on Tuesday after she had to back down following a tweet she posted, and later deleted, that repeated a fake quote from Trump mocking Republicans. Midler on Sunday tweeted a copy of an old image of Trump appearing to quote the then-real estate magnate, saying: \u201cIf I were to run, I\u2019d run as a Republican. They\u2019re the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they\u2019d still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific.\u201d But on Tuesday she retreated, though with a jab of defiance. \u201cI apologize; this quote turns out to be a fake from way back in \u201815-16. Don\u2019t know how I missed it, but it sounds SO much like him that I believed it was true! Fact Check: Did Trump say in \u201898 Republicans are dumb?\u201d she tweeted. Despite a packed two days in London hobnobbing with the royal family and outgoing prime minster Theresa May, Trump found time to hit back. \u201cWashed up psycho @BetteMidler was forced to apologize for a statement she attributed to me that turned out to be totally fabricated by her in order to make \u2018your great president\u2019 look really bad. She got caught, just like the Fake News Media gets caught. A sick scammer!\u201d he tweeted on Tuesday. Unbowed, Midler went on to mock Trump\u2019s sartorial style while in London and also to point out: \u201cTrump said he was greeted by thousands in the UK, but they were actually thousands of protesters.\u201d She rounded off that tweet with: \u201cHow does he always hear the opposite of the truth? Donald, if you\u2019re reading this you SHOULD NOT slam your dick in a door!\u201d She added: \u201cI want to thank everyone who came to my defense last night during my personal Battle of the Bulge with he who must not be named. Your wit and good nature really lifted my spirits; as a newly washed up psycho, I am very grateful for your thoughts and prayers.\u201d Least likely words we\u2019ll ever hear from Midler on Trump? \u201cDid you ever know that you\u2019re my hero?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
