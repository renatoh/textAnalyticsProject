There\u2019s this constant need to dig things out about people. It felt really unnecessary. It felt relentless. It\u2019s really dark. It\u2019s not a funny thing to cover. Someone\u2019s life was on the line here. And their relationship, and their family\u2019s lives.\u201d My favourite game: Graham Gooch v India, Lord\u2019s 1990 \u201cAs he reached 250, collective ears pricked up. On he went, past Wally Hammond\u2019s 251, Glenn Turner\u2019s 259, through the 260s, overtaking Graeme Pollock and Zaheer Abbas on 274, past Compton, May, Richards IVA, and Bradman, again, to reach, after a hiccup of hesitation, a triple hundred, which brought with it the outrageous gesture of removing his helmet.\u201d My favourite film aged 12: Where Eagles Dare \u201cThe dialogue is cursory (\u2018Some people have a sixth sense. He has a sixth, a seventh and an eighth. He\u2019s our best agent\u2019); poor Ingrid Pitt appears to have been cast as a pair of tits; it rather strains credulity that a group of men who, Eastwood apart, look more like a bank\u2019s darts team than hardened killers have been sent to storm a Nazi fortress. But if you can\u2019t suspend disbelief at the movies, where can you?\u201d The wondrous life and mysterious death of Golden Eagle 1703 \u201cHe dug 1703\u2019s frozen carcass out from under the snow and gave it a once over in the wind-whipped field. Much to his surprise, there were no overt signs of trauma. The bird weighed more than 7lb and, aside from being dead, looked to be in good shape. Still, there was no telling what type of damage might be lurking under its plumage. Bare zipped 1703 into a small body bag and chewed over the possibilities on his drive back to the office.\u201d 6. Like pouring tequila on your brain: why Tiger King is the most-watched show on Netflix This documentary revels in humanity\u2019s basest instincts \u2013 but don\u2019t let that put you off 7. Canada shocked by double murder of Indigenous hunters Two M\u00e9tis men were found shot dead in rural Alberta after what police believe was an ambush 8. Krystyna Gaffney obituary \u201cMy aunt, who has died of a brain aneurysm aged 64, worked in the examinations department at Newcastle University for 25 years.\u201d 9. Hunting, meth and big cats: Tiger King\u2019s rarely seen version of southern queerness Who could have guessed that a mullet-wearing, polyamorous exotic animal owner would become TV\u2019s most talked-about gay star? 10.
