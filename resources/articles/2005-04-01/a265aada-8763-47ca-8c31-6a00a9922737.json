It's dark, you're scared and what the hell is that noise? Welcome to Doom 3, the latest in the classic shooter series, and possibly the scariest game on the Xbox. It's one of the best looking, too. The graphics create a slimy, dank environment and the nasty inhabitants are marvellously depicted, which adds to the unsettling atmosphere. While the graphics may have moved on from their pixelated origins, however, the gameplay has not. This is still kill or be killed \u2014 although there is, at least, a pretence of something deeper, with the odd minor puzzle thrown in. You are sent to Mars to investigate some mysterious deaths, and it isn't long before everything goes haywire and you are stuck in an underground base, in desperate need of light. The inhabitants aren't exactly welcoming. Doom 3 uses every horror cliche \u2014 monsters suddenly appearing or scuttling across the dimly lit floor \u2014 and regularly makes you jump. Unfortunately, a reliance on these shock tactics reduces their effectiveness. And, ultimately, shooting things does pall after a while. Which is where online comes in. The normal deathmatch modes are fine, but it is the cooperative section that really shines. Here, players work together to defeat virtual foes. It is great fun and certainly one of the best examples of Xbox online gaming. Pretty dumb it may be, but Doom 3 is a fine distraction. Greg Howson Patience is a must Swat 4 PC, \u00a329.99 Irrational/Vivendi Universal Games, *** If what you seek from a computer game is to experience thrills that would be too dangerous to encounter in the real world, then you may think this is one of the finest games ever. It casts you as the leader of an American Swat team, commanding a squad of four armed-to-the-teeth uber-cops. State-of-the-art graphics and impeccable artificial intelligence make this an adrenaline-inducing experience. But, annoyingly, Swat 4 harks back to the dark ages of PC games, when control systems involved using half the keys on your keyboard. After the tutorial, where you must memorise the functions of about 15 keys, you yearn for an old-fashioned keyboard map. If you have staying power, however, you will eventually work out how to play what is a good game. Your men can be split into two squads of two, and commanded like the soldiers in Full Spectrum Warrior. You can lead from the front, getting involved in the action as if it were a first-person shooter. The technology includes helmet-mounted cameras and the Optiwand, which looks around corners. The missions are believable and plentiful, and the game is equally compelling when played online or cooperatively. Just be prepared to tear your hair out until you learn the badly designed control system. It is worth the effort. Steve Boxer Stretches limits Empire Earth II PC, \u00a334.99 Mad Doc/Sierra, *** Of all genres, real-time strategy (RTS) seems to have stood still the longest \u2014 for most of its 10-year history. With most successful RTS brands in their third or fourth instalments, the question \"where next?\" is hard to ignore. Empire Earth, for example, gave you the whole of human history, starting with hunter gatherers and ending with nuclear bombardment \u2014 how do you follow that? Wisely, this avoids that dilemma by severing all obvious links to its predecessor. You still have 10,000 years of human history and 14 civilisations, but this time, it is a more tactical game \u2014 about dividing and conquering, rather than consolidation. The emphasis has changed from open-ended base building to tightly scripted scenarios that force you down a single tactical path. Don't expect multiple solutions to real-life events \u2014 this is more a homage to human evolution than a genuine reflection of it. The interface boasts a few clever tricks, though, such as \"picture in picture\" (to keep track of units) and a single icon to let you coordinate attacks. It is also massive, with three single-player campaigns and many multiplayer modes. However, having to click through many default messages makes it punishing on the fingers. If you like conventional RTS games, this stretches the template to its limits. Now let's see who has the imagination to take it forward. \u00b7 Keep up with the latest from the gaming world with our Gamesblog at blogs.theguardian.com/games/ \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Online, send your emails to online.feedback@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
