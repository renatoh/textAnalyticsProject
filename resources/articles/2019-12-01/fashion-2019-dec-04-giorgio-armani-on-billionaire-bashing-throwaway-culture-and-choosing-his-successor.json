Five portraits of the designer hang from the walls; five pairs of ice-blue eyes staring intensely. In one almost life-sized Aaron Shikler oil painting, his arms are crossed, his biceps visibly sculpted. In another, an Andy Warhol screen print, he is suited and slick-haired, the epitome of the 1980s power-dressing aesthetic he created. The imposing decor adds to the sense of occasion as I wait, with two of his team, for the 85-year-old to arrive. I am shown to the seat opposite Armani\u2019s empty leather chair. Then the man himself \u2013 a little shorter and whiter-haired than the Masters of the Universe vibe might suggest \u2013 pops his head around the door. On Monday night, Armani was given the Fashion Award for outstanding achievement at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall. Cheering him on was an impressive squad \u2013 including Julia Roberts, Cate Blanchett and Tom Cruise. The recognition means a lot, he says in Italian, speaking through a translator, \u201cand thank God, because getting used to beautiful things is not positive\u201d. \u201cI would like to say,\u201d he volunteers, \u201cthat I really believe the English were the first to create a new fashion. The designers of the 1970s were really innovative. When I decided to do a suit in a different way, it was thanks to English fashion.\u201d He pays particular respect to Mary Quant (\u201cShe really invented a new fashion \u2013 she had courage,\u201d) and Vivienne Westwood. Armani\u2019s style, on the other hand, is very Milanese. For 44 years, he has stuck to sleek, understated design \u2013 think beige linen and navy-blue velvet \u2013 an aesthetic reproduced across an empire of hotels, florists, perfumes, interiors and cosmetics. Today he employs 8,000 people across the globe. Last year\u2019s revenue was \u20ac2.1bn (\u00a31.8bn); Forbes puts his worth at $10.7bn (\u00a38.2bn). Armani customers rhapsodise about the cut of his tailoring, claiming it looks current even 20 years after purchase. The secret to this, he says, is \u201crestraint. Trying not to exaggerate in my idea \u2013 even if my fantasy sometimes goes further I take a step back.\u201d The fashion critics sometimes have other ideas, knocking his shows for being predictable \u2013 when they simply present another collection of nice suits \u2013 or complaining he has distracted from the nice suits if he jazzes things up with natty accessories. In many ways, Armani has set himself apart from fashion, whether criticising its lofty side (he described Prada\u2019s conceptual style as \u201celite, snob fashion\u201d) or becoming embroiled in the odd spat (his 2009 contretemps with Dolce &amp; Gabbana about a pair of quilted trousers was particularly enjoyable). Unlike any other designer operating at his level, he styles all of his shows himself, sometimes teaching models \u201cthe Armani walk\u201d backstage and \u2013 as legend would have it \u2013 even touching up their makeup. Counterintuitively, Armani\u2019s trend-free approach is now on trend, as fashion grapples with its status as one of the world\u2019s most polluting industries. I ask him how it feels to hear his competitors suddenly talking about longevity of design? He gives an entertainingly Bond-villain response, pausing for dramatic effect, laughing heartily then saying: \u201cFinally!\u201d What he is doing about sustainability? \u201cI am obviously aligned,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are all desperately, us in fashion, trying to find solutions, [trying to] provide something that is more sustainable, with every moment.\u201d \u201cMy values have always been in a way sustainable \u2013 I\u2019ve never done things to be thrown away after one season.\u201d Later, over email, he adds: \u201cI\u2019d love for us all to slow down the cycle of collections, and produce less, but of better quality. It seems that designers are locked into a system of renewal that, for me, often seems arbitrary.\u201d Though the Armani Group has signed the Fashion Pact, a series of pledges aiming to make the industry greener, he would like to do something more direct, he says, such as dealing with \u201cthe pollution, the trash that is left out in Rome \u2013 it\u2019s a disaster.\u201d He brings up the flooding in Venice, and \u201cbig boats crashing in front of San Marco \u2013 impossible. It\u2019s a very impossible world at the moment,\u201d he continues. \u201cChildren dying because they haven\u2019t got food, wars still happening. Obviously, every now and then I myself have a doubt if what I am doing is correct, if I should be pushing the pedal or accelerating to provide luxury when all of this is happening.\u201d It\u2019s a fair point. Like most businesses, the Armani Group is pushing for growth, launching a pre-fall collection and new high jewellery range the day before we meet. \u201cThe press and the clients always want more,\u201d he says, \u201cand me, too. At the top of the pyramid is me.\u201d I ask about Extinction Rebellion\u2019s recent protests, of which he says: \u201cI\u2019m against exaggeration, by nature, in everything. I don\u2019t like exhibition, though there is a basis which is justified.\u201d He flirts with the conspiracy theories about Greta Thunberg, seeming reluctant to endorse her unequivocally: \u201cI don\u2019t know enough of her history to know if there is somebody moving her, behind her, but I must say she is strong.\u201d He says she has \u201cuna faccia di bronzo\u201d \u2013 a phrase similar to \u201cbold as brass\u201d in English. Of the media\u2019s response to her, he says: \u201cI don\u2019t like it when [there is] too much shouting.\u201d He raises the issue of exaggeration, again, when I ask whether he feels targeted by the billionaire bashing that has become key to the rhetoric of the US and UK elections. \u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d he says, but says I should take the Forbes listings with a pinch of salt. Once they had him as the third richest person in Italy, he says. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. There are some people who are hiding.\u201d That said, it has been beneficial: \u201cIn a way, being known for what I earn has helped the brand and made it the pinnacle of luxury.\u201d Whatever his bank balance, it is safe to say Armani has quite a lifestyle. He just spent his 85th birthday \u201cin my house in St Tropez, just before starting the summer holidays on my yacht\u201d. He has more modest hobbies, too, such as watching Downton Abbey. I am surprised by the strength of his views on its film adaptation. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to see the film. It was stupid, in a way, to put together in two hours everything that took time to see over series and series [for a] commercial reason.\u201d A decade ago, Armani said it would be \u201cridiculous to still be in charge at 85,\u201d but here we are, and he has still yet to announce a successor. Today he tells me: \u201cI don\u2019t think one person will work \u2013 I think it\u2019s somebody on fashion, somebody on commercial, someone on financial.\u201d \u201cObviously, nowadays, it\u2019s my decision what will happen,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut when I won\u2019t be here any more they will decide what\u2019s best.\u201d Does that worry him? \u201cIt\u2019s my first thought every morning,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a nice feeling.\u201d \u201cBut you have to be strong,\u201d he continues. \u201cThe company has to go on, aside from my person. But I don\u2019t see the alter ego of Armani out there. I also think it\u2019s not fashionable any more. Now companies are done by good people working together.\u201d The night before our interview I attend a dinner after Armani\u2019s pre-fall show. The velvet-clad guests applaud him on arrival; the significance of the seating plan (at dinner, he sits between the menswear head Pantaleo Dell\u2019Orco, and his niece Silvana Armani) is analysed by the media table: \u201cIt\u2019s like Versailles,\u201d proclaims one Italian journalist as necks crane to see who the boss is talking to. For me, it is impossible not to draw parallels with the Logan Roy birthday party scene in the HBO show about a media clan jostling for power, Succession. Armani leaves at about 9pm and the guests applaud again; the atmosphere immediately flattens. The next day, I ask Armani whether he watches Succession. \u201cNo. On purpose. Because then I would think about it in the morning but also in the evening when I am watching TV to relax.\u201d Plus, he says, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be influenced by a TV series \u2013 and [nor do I want] my influencers [to be].\u201d \u201cOnce upon a time, there was a big boss,\u201d he says, and gestures towards one of the oil paintings on the wall. \u201cMaybe the future won\u2019t be like that.\u201d Travel to Milan was paid for by Armani."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
