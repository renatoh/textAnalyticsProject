He was saying that advertising's - like - dead! Philip Gould, trusted adviser to the government and former advertising man, was actually speaking at the annual conference of the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers, but he really did more or less say that advertising's dead. Various thoughts occurred; first, that maybe it was a bit rude to tell the people who had invited him that they were now redundant, and second, that it was bullshit. But third, I was struck by how much we love to scare ourselves about the future, and how rife is the disease of \"endism\". Gould's hypothesis, in brief, was that consumers were now too sophisticated to \"buy\" crafted messages, were able to put companies and products under intense scrutiny before they bought because of the internet, and relied more on word-of-mouth - and mouse. His answer was for marketers to do lots more polling (Huh? Gould owns an eminent polling company. Aaah!). The trend he identified - effectively about empowered consumers and the need for brands to be transparent and authentic - is well-documented. But to take that and then construct a doomsday scenario about the death of advertising seems excessive. In fact, robust modelling of causes and effects shows that the brands most often recommended to friends - or searched for online or asked for at retailers - are those that are most heavily advertised. But maybe these apocalyptic visions can be beneficial in some way if they scare us into taking remedial and evasive action. I'm not so sure about that. Panic-stricken is hardly the state of mind you want to be in when laying strategic plans. Almost every medium has had reports of its death greatly exaggerated at some point. Newspapers were supposed to have been killed off by TV long ago, but they are adapting to new platforms and putting on spurts of growth when a good idea is backed by promotion. Radio is apparently going to be killed off by iPods, though how people get to know what they'd like to download without some more mass medium as the shop window beats me. And so to TV. No medium attracts more ill-informed comment and vicious rivalry. While no one is saying TV itself is dead, I have read many commentators repeat the mantra that the economic model supporting commercial TV - spot advertising - is doomed because of PVRs. I was accused of complacency a couple of years ago when I said that TV commercial impacts (an impact is the viewing of one commercial by one person) would decline by only 9% by 2010 if PVRs reached 8m homes. As it turns out, I probably over-stated the case by about 100%. My error was caused by doing research among early adopters of PVRs who, by definition, are more motivated by the technology. This is a common pitfall when trying to predict the future. In fact, last year was the sixth in a row showing growth in the viewing of TV ads. Never before have more TV ads been viewed by more people. The reason is simple. The instant a home goes multichannel, commercial TV's share of viewing jumps from about 52% to about 62%. By 2012, digital switchover will mean every home will be multichannel. Seen in this light, viewers are entitled to fast-forward through a few breaks, when they are seeing so many extra ads overall. Obviously the growth in broadcast ads won't continue indefinitely, but the truth is shockingly different from the picture that is so often painted. The emerging technologies which will enable people to watch TV out-of-home on all sorts of mobile and IP devices means that total TV will thrive and it will continue to be at the heart of our culture. Far from being a threat to TV, the growth of broadband offers a new distribution mechanism. And as long as brands respond to these new opportunities and invest in creativity they will continue to get a great return on their TV investment. Nothing to worry about then? Sadly not so. The trouble with scaremongering is that people do react to it. Brands start thinking they urgently need to find new ways other than advertising to reach consumers. Media owners start to think they can't depend on advertising revenue and need to make money directly from consumers. If advertisers stop spending money on TV the first things to disappear will be the programmes with the highest ambition, innovation and quality - exactly what advertisers say they want more of. It's easy to set a vicious circle in motion. Journalists should remember this when they feel tempted to go for the sensational spin on media developments. I feel so strongly about this that I have decided to take up a new job at Thinkbox, marketing the whole of the commercial TV industry to advertisers, to get the truth to them about TV - yes, including any bad bits if ever there are any - but hopefully to restore their confidence in this fabulous medium. That means I think it's inappropriate to continue writing here about general advertising issues. Even if I remained impartial, you would not trust what I wrote and I would hate to damage the integrity of this paper. So this article marks the end for me as a journalist. But when my successor is found, make sure you object loudly if s/he ever indulges in any \"endism\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
