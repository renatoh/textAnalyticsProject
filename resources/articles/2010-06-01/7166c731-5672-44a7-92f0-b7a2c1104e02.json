In a stark assessment of the human impact of the cuts the coalition says are required to tackle the ballooning deficit, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, says unemployment will rise to a peak of 2.95 million in the second half of 2012 and remain near that level until 2015, the entire period of the coalition government. It also warns: \"There is little prospect of real wage growth on average throughout this period and ongoing real wage cuts in the public sector.\" The warning comes as the employers' organisation the CBI today demands that the public sector should bear the brunt of budget cuts expected to be announced by the chancellor, George Osborne, in his emergency budget on Tuesday week. The CIPD suggests that a freeze on recruitment in Whitehall followed by a wave of job cuts expected in local government, police and schools could slash the number of public sector staff by around 15%. It said the burden of cuts would fall on the most disadvantaged and present a major challenge to a government that has pledged to \"protect people living in poverty and enhance social mobility\". The warning by the CIPD, not seen as a party political thinktank, underlines the dilemma faced by the government as its efforts to cut the deficit may lead to higher unemployment and then a higher benefits bill. The government this week for the first time signalled that its spending review would extend to the level of welfare benefits and the range of people entitled to receive them. Ministers, partly through a poverty review being conducted by the Labour MP Frank Field, are also looking at ways of replacing Labour's child poverty target, and reducing the range of people entitled to use Sure Start, seen by the Labour as the first plank of the welfare state. The CIPD suggests that a majority of the staff likely to lose their jobs will be women in part-time work or on low wages, who make up a large proportion of the public sector workforce. The figures were leapt on by the TUC general secretary, Brendan Barber, who said the coalition was in danger of damaging the economy and increasing the north-south divide. \"Northern regions depend more on public sector jobs, and staff who lose their jobs will find it harder to get new ones. The private sector will be hit hard too as public procurement is cut. \"The risk of a double-dip recession across the UK as a whole is growing \u2013 and is now a near certainty in those regions that were worst hit by the recession. The net result could well be that the deficit is hardly dented as tax receipts fall and benefit spending grows.\" Labour will view the report as vindication of its efforts over the last two years to protect jobs until the recession was firmly in the past and the recovery assured. The former chancellor Alistair Darling said Labour put in place measures to protect the economy and limit unemployment, which hit 2.5 million in April. CIPD chief economic adviser John Philpott said redundant public sector workers in previous recessions found work in the private sector, but this was unlikely given the poor state of the economy and the austerity measures taken in the UK's major export markets in the eurozone. The report comes as data showed yesterday that Britain's trade deficit with the rest of the world was wider than expected in April. Exports fell 0.6% and imports fell by 0.4% on the month. The figures suggest the weak pound is still not giving the boost to net trade that experts had hoped. The Treasury's new Office of Budget Responsibility is expected to lower the Treasury growth forecast for 2011 from 3.25% set out by the previous government when it delivers its assessment on Monday. Philpott said: \"It is evident that the coalition government's approach to deficit reduction owes much to that successfully pursued by Canada's Liberal government in the 1990s. This resulted in the loss of 265,000 jobs from then 3 million-strong Canadian public sector workforce and an eventual fall in the share of public sector employment in total employment from 26% to 19%.\" He added: \"On an equivalent scale, this translates into around 500,000 UK public sector job cuts, in line with the CIPD's own pre-general election baseline estimate for the period 2010-2015. However, the latter estimate was based on a roughly 60:40 split between cuts in public spending and tax hikes as means of deficit reduction. If as seems likely the coalition government adopts a split closer to 80:20, UK public sector jobs losses of around 725,000 are expected.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
