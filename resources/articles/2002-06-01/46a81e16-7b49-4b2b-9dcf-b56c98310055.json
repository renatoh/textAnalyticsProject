There were only two overnight defections at the final 48-hour stage with 17 due to go to post. Johnston withdrew And Beyond, who won the Queen's Vase at the meeting last year, while Godolphin have taken out Alunissage. Godolphin, who have sent out three Gold Cup winners, rely on Wareed and Hatha Anna. Dermot Weld's Vinnie Roe looks set to start a very warm order to give Ireland its first win in the Gold Cup since 1999 when Enzeli beat Invermark, who is again in the line-up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
