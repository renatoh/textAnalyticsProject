This Thursday is the start of a two-week transition from the year of the sheep to the year of the monkey in that entertaining tool for fortune-telling that is the Chinese calendar. And the astrologers are getting very excited. 2. The lunar new year is, after all, the biggest celebration for the one fifth of the world's population who are ethnic Chinese, and brings with it a new creature from a horoscope cycle of 12: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep (or ram), rooster, dog, boar and monkey. You need to look at a table to find out which one you are. (I'm a rabbit and therefore supposed to be timid and compassionate and apparently looking for a stronger sense of self-worth, responding well to being patted on the head like a bunny - which I can confirm to non-believers is scarily accurate.) 3. The monkey is a coveted birth year as some believe monkeys to be \"smart and lively\". The China Daily reported last week that expectant mothers have been trying to hold off having their babies until it starts. You can also get advice on which signs you should look for in your search for romance. Apparently the most compatible match for a monkey is the rat or the dragon, which you might like to bear in mind next time you're stuck for a chat-up line. 4. The fortune-telling system is known as the Four Pillars of Destiny and works by reading a person's destiny from their birth data. For a particularly surreal interpretation of this, check out the theories about JFK Jr's death in a plane crash in 1999. In the system, the birth data is presented by the animals but also in terms of the five basic elements (metal, water, wood, fire, and earth), which are believed to be the basic components of everything in the universe. This year is going to be the wood monkey. 5. Some Chinese astrologers also predict more general news events as well as reading individual fortunes. One Singapore astrologer, Jason Chng, predicts Osama bin Laden will pack it all in and give up, Taiwan will join China and the US electorate will re-elect George Bush. Other astrologers have different ideas but there seems to be agreement about one thing: the world is going to still be a dangerous place in 2004, what with terrorism and other dangers. 6. In Hong Kong, astrologer Raymond Lo says the monkey year \"will bring unrest, revolution, and overthrow of government ... It will not be peaceful, with more subversive, terrorist activities and assassinations\". 7. Meanwhile US-based astrologer Shelly Wu says: \"Bluffs, tricks, ruses and deceptions abound during monkey years. Those who enjoy risk and novelty, thrive. Those who prefer predictability and convention, wince.\" Perhaps it will also be a year of skullduggery in the media. 8. It is said that when it is the year of your astrological sign you are more vulnerable to bad luck. Wu's website has a list of celebrities' astrological signs, so monkeys including Chinese basketball superstar Yao Ming, Tom Hanks, Jennifer Aniston and Macaulay Culkin should watch out. 9. It was a monkey year when the one-time star of the film Bedtime for Bonzo, Ronald Reagan became the 40th president of the US in 1980. In 1992, the last year of the monkey, the Queen suffered her \"annus horribilis\" when a fire gutted 100 rooms at Windsor Castle and Prince Charles and Princess Diana's marriage publicly broke down. 10. In 1984, football manager Howard Kendall said on television that as it was the year of the rat, he felt his Everton side could win the FA cup as they were captained by Kevin Ratcliffe. And win it they did - so don't underestimate the power of Chinese astrology. Memo to current football managers: perhaps there's a player called Monkey out there somewhere."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
