The Swedish author Lina Wolff is pretty certain that we have not: she is prone, therefore, to outbreaks of satire. In her latest novel she creates a great male genius and pisses all over his magnum opus. This is not a metaphor. Furthermore, it is not even the worst that befalls the magnum opus; it is burned as well. In her first novel, 2016\u2019s Bret Easton Ellis and the Other Dogs, Wolff described a kennel full of dogs named after famous male writers. If readers think these gags are possibly a bit juvenile, fair enough. Wolff is exuberantly tasteless and cynical in both books. In The Polyglot Lovers, the casual destruction of the great genius\u2019s work recalls countless acts of historical sabotage. Some of her characters regard it as a tragedy, others argue that it is not so important because the writer is such a pig (not a dog). This is clearly provocative. The novel opens with online dating, in all its terror. The first of three narrators, Ellinor, comes from Sk\u00e5ne, in southern Sweden, and has discovered through bleak experience that \u201cwhat\u2019s important is not being alone\u201d. She is 36 and has just escaped from a relationship with a sentimental alcoholic. Now she meets a man called Ruben online, and travels to Stockholm to see him. She discovers that Ruben is \u201coverweight, [with] dirty hair \u2026 obviously intoxicated\u201d. Worse, he is also a book reviewer. Despite this, Ellinor goes to his big house by the sea. There he tells her that he is currently borrowing the only copy of a new book by Max Lamas, an acknowledged genius of the age. We might wonder how Max can be such a fool that he has only one copy of his manuscript, but Wolff\u2019s novel would collapse without this device, so he must be a genius at writing but absolutely not a genius at photocopying. Ruben and Ellinor get savagely drunk and, after Ruben has talked a lot about Max, they fight and have violent, cataclysmic sex. Afterwards, Ellinor avenges herself on Ruben by feeding Max\u2019s manuscript into the fire. Ruben accepts this destruction of someone else\u2019s book as a fair punishment, and \u2013 oddly \u2013 Ellinor decides to stay. This is all totally improbable, but the impossibility of the story seems quite deliberate. Ruben goes to his office each day, having observed some careful rituals of bathing and shaving. Ellinor approves of his rigorous personal hygiene. While Ruben is at work, she sifts through his possessions, trying to understand him. In this way, Ellinor unearths Ruben\u2019s secret stash of Michel Houellebecq novels. Ruben is obsessed with Houellebecq, and at times prefers him to Max. Later we discover that Max is obsessed with Houellebecq too, and also obsessed with the question of why people at times prefer Houellebecq to him. Ellinor starts reading Houellebecq as well, and becomes obsessed with him in a different way from Max and Ruben. While Ruben argues that Houellebecq is a genius because he \u201cknows that most things in humans are monstrous, but somewhere in the middle of all that shit there\u2019s something\u201d, Ellinor thinks \u201cthe biggest problem with Houellebecq is that he\u2019s a creep\u201d. Wolff hints that the real genius of her novel might just be Ruben\u2019s wife Mildred, who is blind and psychic. Sadly, everyone ignores her. The book sinks a little when Max takes over the narration and reveals that he is human but mostly monstrous, and sinks a little further when the final narrator \u2013 Lucrezia, the granddaughter of one of Max\u2019s lovers \u2013 confirms this impression. Her sorrowful tale leaves the reader wondering why so many people in this novel are transfixed by Max, when he is such a raving narcissist. Yet these sections include beautiful descriptions of solitude, marital dysfunction, fear of ageing and death and also a lovely set piece (narrated by Max) in a bland corporate highrise, where everyone has succumbed to office psychosis: \u201cArt is in the eye of the beholder,\u201d I said. I was ashamed of my platitude, but comforted myself with the thought that to him it probably seemed like great wisdom. But I was mistaken. \u201cWhat a load of crap,\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cWhat a load of pretentious crap.\u201d Wolff\u2019s writing is pared down and laconic; Saskia Vogel\u2019s translation is excellent and perfectly conveys the haut-cynicism of the original. One final irony is that Max, genius/pig depending on your perspective, is a character in a novel by Lina Wolff, and so is the insane reviewer Ruben, and so, in the end, is a fictional version of Houellebecq. They are all trapped in Wolff\u2019s merciless novel, and are ritually tormented until she has had enough. The result of all this cleverness and torment is a highly enjoyable absurdist comedy about love and desperation, and male geniuses who are feted, and female geniuses who are ignored \u2013 and how despite this invidious state of affairs, we might at least agree that book reviewers are the worst people of all. That is, apart from novelists. \u2022 Joanna Kavenna\u2019s Zed is published by Faber in July.
