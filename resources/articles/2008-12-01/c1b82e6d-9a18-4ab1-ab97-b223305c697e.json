In what could be a crucial week for the future of formula one McLaren and Ferrari, whose budgets each run at around $1m (\u00a3680,000) a day, have pledged to slash their expenditure in a bid to give the smaller and poorer teams a better chance of operating to a competitive standard. \"Through the Formula One Teams Association, the better-funded teams, notably McLaren and Ferrari, are making important concessions in the wider interest of the sport as a whole,\" said Martin Whitmarsh, the McLaren chief operating officer. McLaren, Ferrari and the other Fota members will meet the FIA today to discuss the planned cost-cutting programmes which are expected to include limitations on testing and further restrictions on engine costs in the near future. Meanwhile, radical plans for the governing body to adopt a standard engine specification for the 2010 season look likely to be adopted by the FIA at their World Motor Sport Council meeting on Friday. Max Mosley, the FIA president, has given the teams until tomorrow afternoon to agree the option of using a standard-specification Cosworth engine from 2010. Although there has been no official confirmation from the FIA about the level of interest in this proposal, with Mosley simply claiming last Friday that he had been contacted by three teams, autosport.com claimed yesterday that half the grid are now seriously looking into it. Teams such as Williams and Force India, which are not affiliated to a manufacturer, have also shown an interest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
