He's chocker. Gutted. Frankly, he couldn't care less if he never meets it again; it's brought him nothing but grief. The simmering row, as between neighbours whose fight over a fence has finally come into the open (\"that's it, if your kid's bleeding football comes over again, I'm keeping it\") came to a head yesterday when he was talking about how he intends to spend the extra money Gordon Brown has given him. \"We will reduce and probably eliminate the homeless by 2008,\" he announced. \"Eliminate them?\" giggled a Tory. He snapped back. \"Well, I'm sorry, you know my problems with English. I didn't go to public school ...\" And we realised that this really is a bonkers quarrel. As if only people who went to public school can speak the language coherently! Or, did he mean that using clear prose was a sort of upper-class, toffee-nosed thing to do, like owning a morning suit, or playing polo? Now I must dart about. Earlier in the day the culture, media and sport committee - otherwise known as the Gerry Kaufman Show - met the new chairman and director general of the BBC. I'm afraid that Sir Gerry will have to do better than this to keep his ratings up or he'll find himself rescheduled in a post-midnight slot. He had, I am told, asked his fellow committee members not to be confrontational. Mr Michael Grade seemed to be keen to get rid of his cigar-chomping \"pornographer in chief\" image. The result was that all parties spoke in calm, measured and deeply boring tones. My eye was caught by a very short man sitting next to the new chairman. His nameplate revealed that he had the splendid monicker of Professor Fabian Monds. His eyes flickered from side to side. He said very little. I wondered if he was a James Bond villain. \"007, this is your target: Professor Fabian Monds. He is building a silo to launch nuclear weapons from an undersea volcano off the coast of Jamaica. His bodyguard consists entirely of pouting, bikini-clad lovelies armed with Hechler and Koch machine guns ...\" But then I realised I had read about the professor in a book edited by a former director-general of the BBC, Sir Hugh Carleton-Greene, called The Rivals Of Sherlock Holmes. A century ago there were lots of these, some desperately copying the work of the master, with eccentric detectives and half-witted sidekicks. \"I turned to my companion, who was injecting four-star cognac into his veins. 'Surely the 10 dwarves cannot have stolen all Lady Fabricant's yellow emeralds, Monds?' \"'My dear fellow, quite the contrary. It was Lady Fabricant who stole the dwarves!' So saying, he picked up his flugelhorn and within moments was lost in the dreamy cadences of Gruber's Sonata No 17 for Flugelhorn ...\" Sorry, my attention wandered. It turned out that this apparently sinister figure has been a blameless professor of information systems at some of Northern Ireland's less well-known academic institutions, and he spoke with a soft Ulster accent. So I apologise to him and his family. Back in the Commons John Prescott was defending himself against charges that he was abusing the use of so-called brownfield land. \"The cheek of the hon. member! Does he understand when you set a target for brownfield, it means the rest of it is greenfield? \"Has he worked it out? There's no pink, or yellow lands - it's brown, or it's pink!\" And the English language slunk through its own back door and drew the curtains."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
