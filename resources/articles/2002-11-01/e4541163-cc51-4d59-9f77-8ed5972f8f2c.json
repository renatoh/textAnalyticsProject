But, while he admits he is under severe pressure following a run of results that even his chairman Peter Ridsdale has described as \"unacceptable\", he denies he has ever thought about quitting, let alone standing on the verge of it. Venables could not miss the headlines to that effect which leapt from the news-stands as he made his way through Leeds/Bradford airport yesterday. But he said: \"I don't know how they got such headlines from an interview I gave to TV on Monday evening. It was just a philosophical view. \"I have never considered quitting and I don't have any regrets about taking the job. You always have to do what you think is right in life and this felt right to me. If you didn't act on those instincts, you'd never do anything.\" Venables, though, has admitted that he has not found the job to be as advertised and after Sunday's woeful performance at Spurs, there were question marks about the commitment of his players who, according to reports, made his predecessor's job untenable. The boardroom battle which has threatened to engulf Ridsdale has done nothing to shore up the shifting sands under Venables. As well as giving Ridsdale less time to address his manager's problems, it is thought he might sacrifice him to save his own skin. Venables says: \"I take the criticism personally because it is aimed at me. If it were someone else, I could feel sympathy, but it is not. I am surprised to find myself under pressure so early and I don't know why. I have heard many, many reasons but none of them make any sense to me.\" One theory that has come to his attention is that Leeds' supporters will not accept him because he is a friend of George Graham, another of the club's hated former managers. But it is more the team's acquaintance with the bottom half of the table that has angered fans who expected any fight to be for a Champions League place rather than against relegation. Venables admits that the Premiership is the priority for his team, although tonight's tie, like the previous round's encounter with Hapoel Tel Aviv, gives him the opportunity for a result on foreign soil that could ease the domestic pressures. Neither Mark Viduka nor Robbie Fowler was fit to make the journey, adding to injury problems that will prevent them from fielding a full sub stitutes' bench tonight. But Malaga will be without their star striker and talisman Debray Dario Silva, which is an enormous loss for a side with such a small squad. Silva has helped the club to over-perform in La Liga in a season that has surprised the coach Joaquin Peiro, whose only ambition was to avoid relegation. He says: \"The league position [ninth] is a bit misleading. But if we can carry on in this form and get to halfway with 30 points, that will almost ensure that we stay up.\" Less than a fortnight ago Malaga's cosy Rosaleda stadium was flooded after a storm that swept down from the Andalucia mountains. But the Leeds players had to contend with only a few spots of rain as they trained last night. Venables expresses utmost respect for Malaga and says his team face a difficult game. But in a resort best known for drunken noisy Britons, Venables will be expecting Leeds supporters to be upholding that tradition tonight. Malaga (probable; 4-4-2): Contreras; Sanz, Valcare, Josemi, Roteta; Leko, Romero, Sandro, Musampa; Edgar, Valdes. Leeds (probable; 4-4-2): Robinson; Kelly, Okon, Woodgate, Harte; Bowyer, Bakke, McPhail, Wilcox; Smith, Kewell.
