The minimum age of candidacy for all elections in Britain is currently 21 and the minimum age for voting 18. Labour is expected to endorse the findings and put some form of commitment into its next general election manifesto. The party is expected to debate the issue at this year's conference, having trailed it in the \"Big Conversation\" initiative, and take up the conclusions in the party's general election manifesto. The Electoral Commission's decision to opposing lowering the voting age will disappoint campaigners who have argued that it will help turn the tide of declining voter turnout. At the 2001 general election the 39% turnout among 18 to 25-year-olds was the lowest of any age group. A Mori poll last year found 60% of people under 16 backed lowering the voting age. According to Alex Folkes of the Vote at 16 campaign, research from Austria and Germany suggests that the earlier people are able to exercise their first vote, the more likely they are to sustain the habit. Lobbyists also point out that at present 16-year-olds can leave school, apply for a passport, pay tax, have sex, play the national lottery, smoke, join a trade union and, with their parents' consent, join the armed forces or get married. However, they cannot vote. Critics claim that giving under-18s the right to vote will not of itself increase interest in politics. The voting age is 18 in most of Europe. The age bar on candidates stretches back to laws passed in 1695, although the anomaly only began when the voting age was reduced to 18 in 1969."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
