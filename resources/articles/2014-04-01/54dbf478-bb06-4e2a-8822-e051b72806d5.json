About the game that awaits, the week\u2019s preparations and the key points he needs to reaffirm. \u201cYou just consider there are last things that you want to say to the players, or to certain players. [But] if you still have to talk a lot before the game, then I think you missed out on things during the week.\u201d Since Melbourne Heart\u2019s inaugural coach answered his old club's SOS over the summer, the message he\u2019s been trying to drill in to his players has been a simple one: express yourselves. \u201cStart playing football. Play free. That\u2019s the reason why, when you were a little boy, you started to play, because you wanted to show your talent and you wanted to enjoy [yourself], and that\u2019s what you should have at this level as well. \u201cWithin that, of course, we will have a certain team discipline and roles that you have to do. But within that, there\u2019s still a lot of freedom to express the player that you are, and that\u2019s what I try to reinforce in my sessions.\u201d It\u2019s a message which transformed the Heart from one of the biggest losers (or, technically, non-winners) on record into a team that dropped just two points in seven matches. It wasn\u2019t all just down to a change in mindset though. Van \u2018t Schip switched to a three-man midfield, and started showing faith in the likes of Iain Ramsay and Ben Garuccio. But it was when their marquee man-mountain, Orlando Engelaar, finally made his long-awaited debut for the club that everything changed. His first run in the red and white triggered an extraordinary change in fortunes, and John Aloisi may very well still be leading the club had Engelaar been able to get on the pitch earlier. \u201cHe has special kind of things in the way he\u2019s playing. And he\u2019s not even on his top level right now, because he\u2019s coming back from injury and he didn\u2019t really have a pre-season. So for sure, [having him fit] would have changed things a lot, I think. But it\u2019s football. You always have to deal with those kinds of things. It was a big loss for the club.\u201d Of course, you could also link Heart\u2019s sudden outbreak of showpiece football to their acquisition by Manchester City the following week. With Van \u2018t Schip on the sidelines, Engelaar on the pitch and City CEO Ferran Soriano in the boardroom, it all started going gangbusters. Prior to the takeover, Heart had equalled the league\u2019s longest winless streak. In the month or so following the announcement, they were so dominant that being held to draw looked like a underachievement. City, by contrast, went into the takeover having lost just two out their past 26 matches, and came out of it barely able to win every second game. The old order has since been restored, and for Van \u2018t Schip, it\u2019s not a case of City\u2019s charm wearing off or emotions no longer propelling his team to victory. \u201cWe should not exaggerate those things. The influence of City we have to see more and more next year. This year, we had to deal with the same players, the same circumstances, the same training facilities, so I don\u2019t believe in that too much. \"It could be a percentage or whatever, maybe it\u2019s given us a little bit of a change. But bringing that back every time to the influence of City ... I haven\u2019t seen that. \u201cI don\u2019t see the difference in the effort the boys are putting in, or in the way that we are playing. Things went our way [for a while] and now, actually, we are having a period where we are getting [in front] and then we give it away. \u201cYou look at the game against Brisbane, we really played well the first half. Dominating. And also against Adelaide. They\u2019re two good opponents, the best teams at this moment in the league, and we were really matched up against them. \u201cWe were all happy, actually surprised by the take-over. Nobody really expected it. But, of course, the positive thing is the way they came and they explained and the talks that we already had, so we\u2019re very excited about the coming period.\u201d To put the size of the takeover into context, City pay their maligned \u2018keeper Joe Hart as much per season as they did for Melbourne Heart in perpetuity, but it was a sale that not even the Western Sydney wunderkinds could trump. What it means for the club long-term is still unclear. A change in name and colours is an option, and one Van \u2018t Schip is unwilling to share his thoughts on. As for the possibility of picking up some young guns from City\u2019s overflowing talent pool, he says there are no names on the table yet. \u201cWe are going to go to Manchester and have good talks with the people there, talk about certain types of positions, and then we\u2019re going to see what type of players we can get.\u201d There\u2019s also been talk of City sharing their coaching knowledge with the club, if only to skirt around Uefa\u2019s Financial Fair Play regulations. Has that happened? \u201cNo. Because I\u2019m the coach. I\u2019ve got my philosophy, I\u2019ve got my vision, and that\u2019s the same way Manchester City wants to play, a beautiful kind of way of football, possession way of football, and that\u2019s also the reason we agreed to work on together and continue this with a new contract [which has been extended until mid-2017]. \u201cBut of course, if they start to work here with the youth academy, it\u2019s good to have coaches in who can instruct the coaches here, and we need of course in all of Australia a lot of coaches to instruct the younger players. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going there, and I\u2019m very happy to learn. We still all can learn from each other. That\u2019s why I\u2019m excited about this time that I\u2019m going to have there in a few weeks.\u201d Come Saturday, Van \u2018t Schip will make the walk to AAMI Park for the final time this season. In his head, he\u2019ll be going over another of the messages he\u2019s been giving since his return: play for the future. \u201cSaturday we get a new game against Western Sydney, and we all want to finish well ... because we want to continue, you know. This is not the last game. It\u2019s not the end of a project. It\u2019s just the start, and that\u2019s how we\u2019ll approach it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
