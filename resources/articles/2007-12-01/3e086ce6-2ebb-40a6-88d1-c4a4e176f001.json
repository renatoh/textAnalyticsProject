In an echo of Tony Blair's talks with Paddy Ashdown a decade ago, designed to keep the Tories out of power for a generation, Cameron calls for co-operation across a range of fronts. The move comes two days before the Lib Dems unveil their new leader following the resignation of Sir Menzies Campbell, an instrumental figure in the Lib-Lab talks that led to a commission on electoral reform in 1998 and eight years of coalition government in Scotland. Nick Clegg or Chris Huhne will take over on Tuesday after what is expected to have been the closest contest for the Liberal crown for more than a decade. Cameron makes clear he believes the Lib Dems should co-operate with the Tories along with the Greens. In a move that will fuel speculation that he is preparing the ground for establishing a coalition government with the Lib Dems in the event of a hung Parliament, the Tory leader says: 'I've always believed that political parties, even though they may have serious disagreements over many aspects of policy, should work together in areas where they agree. 'So I hope than in 2008 the Liberal Democrats and the Green party will join us in putting pressure on the government to decentralise power, and that together we can create a new progressive alliance to decentralise British politics.' Cameron's move comes as a new opinion poll gives the Tories a 13-point lead over Labour. The YouGov poll for the Sunday Times puts the Conservatives on 45 per cent, up four on last month, with Labour on 32 per cent, down three points. The Lib Dems are up one on 14 per cent. Gordon Brown's personal ratings have slumped 16 points to minus 26 per cent. The Prime Minister was on plus 48 per cent in the summer. Cameron has a personal rating of plus 20 per cent. Amid this backdrop Cameron today attempts to reach out to both Clegg and Huhne by offering to co-operate on the key areas of devolving power and the environment. 'This modern decentralisation agenda is key to achieving social and environmental progress,' he writes on his blog at www.conservatives.com. 'We will never win the fight to make British poverty history as long as we rely on top-down, centralised state mechanisms. We will only achieve our green objectives - whether improving the quality of life in our neighbourhoods or reducing carbon emissions - by empowering individuals and communities.' Cameron has two objectives in mind. First, he aims to use his 'progressive alliance', that would allow the grassroots to flourish, to expose Brown as an outdated politician wedded to state-imposed solutions. Second, he aims to co-operate with the Lib Dems, but secure himself a place on the high ground if the new leader spurns his overtures. Huhne last night dismissed the offer. 'David Cameron's claims to be pushing the green agenda are just as hollow as Gordon Brown's. In the summer of 2006 we had to break off our attempts to come up with joint policies because the Conservatives were not prepared to talk seriously about green taxes.' The intervention by Cameron comes as Brown shakes up his operation in Downing Street. Ed Miliband, the Cabinet Office Minister, is to take on an enhanced role amid complaints from cabinet ministers that senior officials around the Prime Minister have struggled to shape the political agenda. In a bid to draw a line under the Blair era, Brown handed minimal powers to political figures in No 10 and appointed civil servants to all the key posts. Ministers have complained that this has meant that No 10 has been caught off guard during the politically fraught period of the past few months. 'Ed Miliband will have an enhanced role in co-ordinating Downing Street,' one source said. 'Where there is political work it should be done by ministers.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
