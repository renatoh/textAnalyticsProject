It's a good place to start", "bodyText": "Whether you regard 26 January as an occasion to celebrate modern Australia or see it as \u201cInvasion Day\u201d, \u201cSurvival Day\u201d, or just another public holiday, one thing is certain: the shocking rates of violence, family breakdown and incarceration among Indigenous Australians will still be with us on 27 January. Amid all the celebration \u2013 and squabbling \u2013 around Australia Day, we need to continue to focus on the immediate, often life-threatening, problems, especially in remote communities, and what can be done to make the communities safer. For just how long these dire problems remain depends on many factors, including what governments do now. Working with the \u201cNo More\u201d coalition of Indigenous women and men against violence, I will propose to our prime minister Malcolm Turnbull that he could take a very positive step to assisting us to end the violence if he were to ask Ken Wyatt MP, minister for Indigenous health and aged care and first Aboriginal minister of the commonwealth, to take responsibility for this issue. Many of us are waiting for the time when he will become minister for Indigenous affairs. His knowledge and understanding of the area, the respect he has earned on both sides of the parliament, and his pride in his Indigenous heritage would make his appointment an historic one. A coordinated approach by the federal government with the states and territories is urgently required. The latter are responsible for child protection and law enforcement \u2013 two critical issues for Indigenous Australians. Here are some facts. Ask yourself: would such situations, of such magnitude, be permitted to continue in your suburb? Indigenous women are 32 times more likely to be hospitalised for family violence than non-Indigenous. About a quarter of Indigenous Australians aged above 15 report being victims of physical or threatened violence \u2013 twice the rate for non-Indigenous. Hospitalisation rates for Indigenous assault are highest in remote and very remote areas. The mortality rate for assault for Indigenous Australians is seven times the rate of non-Indigenous. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are 27% of the prisoner population in Australia but only 2% of the Australian population. 17,000 Aboriginal children are under care and protection orders and another 15,455 in out-of-home care. Indigenous children are seven times more likely to be receiving child protection services than non-Indigenous children. The suicide rate for Indigenous Australians is double that for non-Indigenous. One of the good things about Australia Day is that it provokes discussion about history and the ongoing relevance to the present of what happened long ago. Granted, the main Australian history textbook in state schools in Australia in the 1960s made fleeting reference to Aboriginal people in a single paragraph, listing them after \u201cfauna and flora\u201d. But it is inconceivable that such a text would be taught today, and it\u2019s strange that some Aboriginal activists are so stuck in the past that they still claim Aboriginal history is suppressed. That stance ignores the huge body of work covering that history \u2013 books, memorials, documentaries, films, museum exhibitions, artworks, plays, oral history projects and web sites ensuring we never forget the dispossession, massacres, resistance and forced removals. The most important struggle for Indigenous justice in the first half of the 20th century was the battle for full citizenship rights, led by strong people like William Cooper, Doug Nicholls and Marge Tucker. We must never forget their struggle and legacy \u2013 their determination to win rather than just protest and, above all, their remarkable dignity. They were confident their demands could stand up to rigorous debate. Our demands for safe communities cannot be realised by governments alone. As Indigenous Australians, we know all too well that there is need in some places for cultural change at the grassroots level, for greater personal responsibility. But there are now many inspiring role models among Australia\u2019s 750,000 Indigenous Australian citizens. In 1966, headlines were made around Australia when an Aboriginal man graduated from university with a full degree. It was sensational news, making Charles Perkins a public figure. Today, there are more than 30,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander university graduates. The great majority of Aboriginal Australians reside and work in cities and towns and are to be found in nearly all professions and occupations, including most recently that of airline pilot. There is much goodwill in the Australian community and it is ridiculous that in the 21st century \u2014 in a rich, democratic country like Australia \u2014 problems such as Indigenous family violence still exist to the extent they do.
