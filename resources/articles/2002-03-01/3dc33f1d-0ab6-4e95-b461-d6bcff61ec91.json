However, their shock Challenge Cup defeat by Leeds was a first hint of how the elder Paul will be missed in the big matches, despite the arrival of the huge Kiwi wing Lesley Vainikolo. Key man Paul Deacon. This talented young scrum-half has already played for England and Great Britain, but with the Paul brothers standing in his way had not established himself as a starting regular for the Bulls. Now that Henry has gone to Gloucester, Deacon has been given first crack at filling the huge void alongside Robbie. Prediction Grand final losers. Title odds 11-8 Halifax Blue Sox Coach Steve Linnane (Aus) Captain Brett Goldspink (Aus) Last season 9th Prospects Linnane, another coach who took over midway through last season, comes across as a shrewd operator. If he can instil some discipline in the big Blue Sox forwards such as Jim Gannon and Andy Hobson they will be hard to beat, especially at the Shay. Key man Karle Hammond. Hammond's career has gone seriously off the rails since a valiant performance for London in their 1999 cup final drubbing by Leeds, with unhappy stints at Widnes and Salford. But he has shown early promise and revealed hidden goalkicking prowess as the Blue Sox progressed to this year's quarter-finals. Prediction 8th Title odds 200-1 Leeds Rhinos Coach Daryl Powell (GB) Captain Francis Cummins (GB) Last season 5th Prospects Leeds have been the underachievers of the Super League era, with a single Challenge Cup in six seasons. But with quality Australians such as Ben Walker and Matt Adamson and a crop of exciting youngsters led by Rob Burrow and Kevin Sinfield they are shaping as contenders again. Key man Ben Walker. The classy Queenslander has accepted the poisoned chalice of replacing Iestyn Harris and has already won over the South Stand with his performances in cup wins over Bradford and Hull KR. Certainly Harris's equal as a goalkicker, and coach Powell reckons he is \"more of a team player\". Prediction 3rd Title odds 5-1 St Helens Coach Ian Millward (Aus) Captain Chris Joynt (GB) Last season 4th Prospects After starting last year with wins in the World Club Championship and Challenge Cup, Saints ran out of bodies and steam in the Super League. The cup may again be their best bet because they do not have the squad depth of Wigan, Leeds or Bradford - and Kevin Iro and David Fairleigh are huge losses. Key man Sean Long. The Great Britain scrum-half has now had two knee reconstructions, which must be a worry, but if he can stay fit his midfield combination with Keiron Cunningham, Paul Sculthorpe, Tommy Martyn and Paul Wellens should wreak havoc once more. Prediction 4th Title odds 3-1 Wakefield Trinity Wildcats Coach Peter Roe (GB) Captain Paul Broadbent (GB) Last season 11th Prospects Roe has an excellent record of drawing the best from limited resources and the signs in last week's shock cup win at Widnes were that the fighting spirit that served Trinity so well under John Harbin is still there. Key man Ted Richardson. The long-serving chairman is still looking to attract extra investment into Super League's most notorious financial strugglers. The next crisis is always just around the corner, and that uncertainty cost Trinity the services of John Harbin, the Yorkshire-born Queenslander who was such an inspiration last season. Prediction 11th Title odds 500-1 Widnes Vikings Coach Neil Kelly (GB) Captain Steve Carter (Aus) Last season Premiership champions (promoted) Prospects Facing a baptism of fire with games against St Helens, Castleford and Bradford in the first three rounds, and the pressure is on after their bad cup defeat by Wakefield. But Kelly has assembled a pack that looks strong enough to survive. Key man Steve Carter. An Australian grand final winner with Penrith back in 1991, the chunky stand-off has been signed as Kelly's on-field general, and his experience will be vital to the Super League newcomers. Some Australians suggest that Carter has been a declining force for the past couple of years; Kelly disagrees. Prediction 10th Title odds 50-1 Castleford Tigers Coach Graham Steadman (GB) Captain Danny Orr (GB) Last season 8th Prospects Cas have impressed in cup victories over Salford and London, with the defence looking especially solid, and have a favourable draw as a result of last year's disappointing bottom-half finish. So Steadman's first full season in charge could see a return to the play-offs. Key man Wayne Bartrim. There is no questioning the ability of this vastly experienced goalkicking hooker, as his clutch of State of Origin appearances for Queensland confirms. However, his attitude has been questioned sporadically throughout his career, one of the reasons he has been nicknamed Forrest Gump. Prediction 6th Title odds 50-1 Hull Coach Shaun McRae (Aus) Captain Jason Smith (Aus) Last season 3rd Prospects McRae has extra responsibilities after the former chief executive Shane Richardson's return to Australia, and Hull have a tougher draw than last year. But they have recruited shrewdly, with Toa Kohe-Love out wide and \"Knuckles\" Greenhill up front, and should at least make the play-offs. Key man Richard Horne. The leader of a new crop of youngsters who hold the key to Hull's hopes of shaking up the big four, Horne was thrown in for Great Britain against Australia last autumn and did not look out of his depth. Now Hull need him to start dominating matches, and ease the burden on the inspirational Smith. Prediction 5th Title odds 12-1 London Broncos Coach Tony Rea (Aus) Captain Jason Hetherington (Aus) Last season 6th Prospects Finishing in the top half last season guarantees plenty of attractive opposition at Brentford, with St Helens and Hull due twice each, but the Broncos also have two trips apiece to Wigan, Leeds and Bradford, which are likely to stymie their play-off hopes. Key man The physio. The Broncos' first-choice 13 again look good enough to beat the best, with Hetherington at hooker, Richie Barnett at full-back, Jim Dymock at loose forward and Rusty Bawden back from Melbourne to stiffen the pack. But injuries to Hetherington and Barnett last season badly exposed the lack of depth in London's squad. Prediction 7th Title odds 100-1 Salford City Reds Director of football/coach Steve Simms (Aus)/Steve McCormack (GB) Captain Bobbie Goulding (GB) Last season 10th Prospects The Reds lost 10 of their last 11 games last season, wooden-spoon form. Simms, who made such an impact in a previous British stint with Leigh, will provide much-needed experience in support of McCormack, but it didn't do much good in a woeful cup performance at Cas. Key man Darren Treacy. The pick of an uninspiring set of signings, Treacy is a back-row forward of undeniable talent, but as many questions have been asked about his attitude as about that of Cas's Wayne Bartrim. If Salford are to make any sort of impact they need Treacy to have a huge season. Prediction 12th Title odds 500-1 Warrington Wolves Performance director/ coach Steve Anderson (Aus)/ David Plange (GB) Captain Matt Rodwell (Aus) Last season 7th Prospects The Queenslanders Darryl Van de Velde and Allan Langer have gone - and so too, apparently, has a beer culture that was rugby league's equivalent of Maine Road. Anderson is laying more solid foundations, but that could lead to some short-term pain. Key man Lee Briers. At least many Warrington fans think he should be; Anderson's attitude is not so clear. The gifted playmaker was made to play at full-back in the cup defeat by St Helens and rumours persist that he is wanted by Widnes and St Helens. Prediction 9th Title odds 50-1 Wigan Warriors Coach Stuart Raper (Aus) Captain Andy Farrell (GB) Last season Runners-up Prospects Humiliation by Bradford in last year's grand final has provided an extra spur for a team boasting the outstanding talents of Farrell and Kris Radlinski, a new mean streak in the New Zealand prop Craig Smith and an outstanding, ambitious coach in Raper. Key man Julian O'Neill. The game's most notorious bad boy showed signs of calming down in the past two years with the North Queensland Cowboys but had to cope with unimaginable tragedy last summer when his first child was killed in a household accident. Wigan have brought him from Australia to play stand-off, and his midfield partnership with Farrell will be crucial. Prediction Champions Title odds 15-8"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
