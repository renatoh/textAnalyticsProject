Who said 2017 was all bad news? Thanks for reading everyone and see you in 2018! Judging by the comments (I\u2019m paraphrasing here, but they were basically \u201clove the liveblog Tim \u2013 an interesting subject that you\u2019ve brought to life with your incisive prose\u201d) I know that everyone will be very sad that Love Island is now over. Which is why I am here to share some VERY GOOD NEWS with you from Press Association ... LOVE ISLAND RECOMMISSIONED FOR FOURTH SERIES IN 2018 A new batch of singletons looking for romance will enter the Love Island villa when the hit reality show returns for a fourth series in 2018. The show has been recommissioned for another run next year as the third series comes to an end. The seven-week show, in which young people pair up in a villa in Majorca, has been a ratings hit for ITV2. The channel says the show is its most successful format among 16-34s. Paul Mortimer, head of digital channels and acquisitions said: \u201cAt ITV2, we couldn\u2019t be more thrilled with how Love Island fever has gripped the nation. Now established as the perfect series to start the summer, we\u2019re delighted to be bringing the show back for our young adult audience in 2018.\u201d Kem has been given the full prize money of \u00a350,000 and now has to decide whether to share it with Amber or become a national pariah. Unbelievably he decides to share it and make at least that amount 20 times over by doing PAs at student unions and aggy clubs in small towns for the next year. Meaning that Camilla and Jamie are runners up \u2013 proving that one thing Jamie can\u2019t do is win Love Island. \u201cMy \u2018eads gone!\u201d says Kem, which originally appeared on the b-side to Weak Become Heroes. BACK ON THE TV ... oh god Kem is still banging on about his love for Amber. Ten minutes to go and then you can all go home and pretend you never watched Love Island anyway. You came for the Love Island liveblog, instead you got a delayed conversation on different platforms between me and the MP for Birmingham Yardley. IMPORTANT UPDATE: Jess Phillips was referring to Dennis Skinner being a Big Brother fan and not Mike Skinner. Given that neither are true and this blog has become completely surreal, it probably doesn\u2019t matter that I was too stupid to realise this at the time. I can\u2019t hear Kem speak now without thinking it\u2019s a massively disappointing Mike Skinner comeback single. Not everyone agrees ... We are into climactic interview with the two finalists territory now. \u201cYou\u2019re an underwear model, you read books, you cook ... what can\u2019t you do?\u201d Caroline Flack asks Jamie. I have racked my brains and I don\u2019t think there is anything in the history of human accomplishment that Flacko has left off her list there so fair play to the polymath. This truly is the era of Trump, Brexit and ... Love Island? I think that\u2019s a bit harsh. It\u2019s not like Trump would ever pie anyone off after they\u2019d grafted so hard Apparently I was so busy liveblogging tonight\u2019s show that I actually missed this piece of televisual gold ... My favourite remaining couple \u2013 based purely on entertainment value rather than the fact they might stay together beyond, say, 11.37pm tonight \u2013 are out. But third place ain\u2019t bad for two people who can\u2019t really stand the sight of each other. And who can forget that magic moment when Olivia asked Chris if he wanted to be her boyfriend, and when he said \u201cyes\u201d she got stroppy and said: \u201cNo, you have to ask me!\u201d It\u2019s sadly not to be for the Blazin\u2019 Squad lothario and Gabby who hopefully loves him but possibly doesn\u2019t really that much but maybe does even though the lie detector said she definitely didn\u2019t. At least this gives us all a chance to recap those first few weeks when Marcel tried to impress everyone by telling them he was once in Blazin\u2019 Squad. For true Love Island stans this recalled the classic early series two days when Zara Holland kept telling anyone with ears that she didn\u2019t want anyone to know that she was actually Miss Great Britain. Happy times. My liveblog brings all the Labour MPs to the yard. Come on Dennis Skinner, don\u2019t be shy now ... There is now a massive recap. In brief: Kem and Amber have been together since the first day, Marcel and Gabby have been together since almost the first day and Chris and Olivia have been rowing repeatedly since the first day. Only Camilla has been on what you might call \u201ca journey\u201d. She spent ages trying to convince herself that she was actually in love with some bonehead called Johnny, then when that went wrong she attracted a terrifyingly intense guy called Craig who was basically everything wrong with men in Love Island form. Finally she found love with Jamie who models pants and knew what The God Delusion was. Has a sweeter love story ever been told? As the couples round off their poetry with some bad dancing, maybe it\u2019s time to reflect on this year\u2019s series? It\u2019s been the surprise smash hit of the summer, but has it matched the previous two series? I\u2019m not so sure ... there has been a distinct lack of backstabbing and bedhopping this time around. And where were the Zara Hollands and Jess Hayes to liven things up? I feel like the true Love Island heads will know what I mean. Still this is no time to delve into \u201cit was better when it was more underground\u201d purism ... Love Island is having it\u2019s Different Class moment, so let\u2019s all appreciate that. Chris has written a poem for Olivia called ... Olivia. \u201cOur journey is ending, where another one begins. If I\u2019m snowy, you\u2019re Tin Tin\u201d Olivia is responding with a poem that is possibly too banal even for this liveblog. Luckily Jamie and Camilla are up next to talk about a humanitarian crisis somewhere ... Kem\u2019s poem for Amber is basically the worst Streets song of all time. Dry Your Eyes, Melt ... Amber is so overcome with emotion she can\u2019t get her one-syllable rhyming couplets out. It ends with \u201cYou\u2019re basically the boy version of me, and I love you.\u201d Make of that what you will. It\u2019s time for the love poems to be unveiled ... Marcel tells Gabby: \u201cThere are so many small moments that mean so much to me,\u201d before talking about their first kiss on the steps. He\u2019s looking hot in his tuxedo. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that only heterosexual relationships seem to be allowed on Love Island, I would marry Marcel myself. Gabby responds by dropping a Blazin\u2019 Squad reference into hers. There is no truth in the rumour that fringe23\u2019s comment has been framed and proudly hung outside the Scott Room in the Guardian offices. The rumour that fringe23 is actually my mum is also definitely untrue. What I\u2019ve learned today: it\u2019s really quite hard to liveblog a show that has been on for 20 minutes so far and the main thing that\u2019s happened is four girls have chosen a dress to wear The Islanders are all writing love poetry for their partners. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a big dick,\u201d offers up Olivia. \u201c... and nice eyes?\u201d Who said the spirit of Percy Bysshe Shelley was dead? Judging by the screams in the crowd for each couple it seems Marcel and Gabby are favourites tonight, with Kem and Amber close behind. But that could possibly be down to the fact the crowd just cheered a bit louder each time a couple\u2019s name was announced. According to the bookies, Kem and Amber are favourites. I was telling people to back Montana and Alex only two days ago at 16/1 and they were voted out last night so whatever you do with your money, don\u2019t listen to me. We are only ten minutes in and already I sense that my readers/fans are firmly behind this project At the end of the day, you\u2019re all watching, you\u2019re all reading, you\u2019re all voting using the official Love Island app, you\u2019re all hoping Chris and Olivia win and one of them pies the other off for the grand prize. So stop pretending and just enjoy it ... The Islanders are learning to tango by the poolside. Chris and Olivia are arguing. Kem is boasting that he has rhythm. Marcel is thrusting. You know, I really hope that this liveblog doesn\u2019t coincide with the precise moment where I realise that Love Island is actually completely vacuous and not actually worthy of a liveblog, nor giving up every night of my life for the last month. We\u2019re off with a bang. Or at least a banger ... Alison Limerick\u2019s Where Love Lives. Now, this might be a bad time to point this out but ... the live final is normally the worst episode of Love Island. A load of liggers descend on the pool while Caroline Flack interviews the contestants. Not that I\u2019ve seen every past series or anything like that. To warm everyone up here\u2019s some Guardian pieces on Love Island Is it wrong to be watching Love Island? (Spoiler alert: no) Love Island and the evolution of sex on reality TV (Spoiler alert: it got smuttier) What can 12 horny men and women teach us about romance (Spoiler alert: nothing) Can reality TV ever top Love Island? (Spoiler alert: no) Should I be worried that I wrote two of those? (Spoiler alert: yes) So what was it that we all used to do before Love Island? How exactly did we spend each night of the week, if not watching a bunch of inexplicably ripped young men try and crack on with a variety of bikini-clad women? Perhaps we read Tolstoy, or pondered the big questions of theoretical physics, or maybe we simply met real life people for a beer. Whatever it was, it sounds boring, a complete waste of time in comparison. Because this year\u2019s Love Island has undoubtedly been one of the TV smashes of the summer, and we are all going to feel its absence when it\u2019s gone. But it\u2019s not over yet. We have one more episode to go \u2013 a whopping 95 minute special \u2013 before we wave goodbye. And in that time we get to see which of the remaining couples are deemed loved-up enough to scoop the \u00a350,000 prize money. Will it be Kem and Amber who\u2019ve (sort of) stuck together from the start, despite the fact their relationship began with Kem throwing a pillow at Amber because she admitted to once sleeping with more than one man in a night? Will it be Chris and Olivia who have spent most of their time in the villa hating each other yet seem inextricably bonded by their shared talent for saying \u201cyeaaaahh\u201d in a whiney manner? Will it be Camilla and Jamie, who have positioned themselves as the show\u2019s Great Intellects on the grounds that they have both read at least one book and one of them cares about refugees? Or will it be Marcel and Gabby, who should really have been disqualified from entering on the grounds that at least one of them seems to be a nice, understanding and patient person? One thing I can safely predict is that nobody cares who wins. We don\u2019t watch Love Island for the winners! We watch it to see which attractive person gets pied, who\u2019s the biggest melt and how contestants go about explaining to their parents why they had sex on live TV. Tonight\u2019s grand finale starts on ITV2 from 9pm so join us then for the ride \u2026"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
