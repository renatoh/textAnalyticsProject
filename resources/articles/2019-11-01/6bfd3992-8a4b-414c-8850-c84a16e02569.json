But Australia\u2019s love of summer - one that stretches from spring to autumn - means we can\u2019t afford to be careless in our approach to sun care. Here\u2019s our list on everything from choosing the right makeup and sunscreen to adequately protecting your eyes and learning to decipher the UV index, to ensure you safely enjoy the long, hot days ahead. Know your UV index ratings Ultraviolet (UV) radiation can be high even on an overcast day. It\u2019s important to check the UV index on a daily basis so you know whether sun protection will be needed when you\u2019re outdoors. When the UV index is expected to reach 3 or above this can damage your skin and lead to skin cancer, so sunscreen is a must. To make it easier to check the UV index wherever you are, download the SunSmart app. Up your veggie intake Summer is the time to load up on foods rich in vitamin A, such as broccoli, carrots, spinach, mango, capsicum and rock melon. Researchers from Brown University have found that people whose diets include high levels of vitamin A are 17% less likely to get cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, a common form of skin cancer. Additionally, eating foods that contain vitamin E, such as oily fish, lean meats and nuts, can help reduce UV damage to the skin. Screen yourself Research from King\u2019s College London has found that because people typically do not apply enough sunscreen to utilise its full efficacy, it\u2019s often better to opt for a sunscreen with a high SPF rating, such as SPF50. And if you\u2019re thinking of skipping it altogether, the study also found considerable DNA damage on areas of the skin that had no sunscreen, even when the UV radiation on a particular day was very low. For maximum protection, apply sunscreen at least 10-20 minutes before going outdoors so the sunscreen can form a proper protective film on your skin. As a guide, use about a teaspoon-sized amount of sunscreen for each of your arms and legs, the front of your torso, the back of your torso, and your face (including your neck and ears). Remember to reapply every two hours, and more often if you\u2019ve been sweating or have been in the water. Be squint free The more time we spend in the sun, the higher the risk of eye damage from UV radiation, so it\u2019s important to get in the habit of wearing sunglasses, particularly from a young age. Wraparound sunglasses and those with polarised lenses are particularly good at reducing glare. Look for sunglasses with a value of 3 or 4 under Australian and New Zealand Standards, as they absorb almost all UV radiation. To ensure you get the right frames and lenses to provide maximum protection for your eyes, visit a reputable eyewear provider, such as OPSM, to help you find the right sunglasses for your lifestyle. Go Ultra Violette If you\u2019re not a fan of sunscreen, the great news is that gone are the days of sticky, white creams. In their place are far more wearable formulations, with Aussies leading the charge. Local brand Ultra Violette considers itself a \u201cskinscreen\u201d, which means it\u2019s also designed to work as skincare; it\u2019s ultra hydrating and can be layered with serums, moisturisers and foundation without compromising on protection. Another product, Go-To\u2019s Zincredible, can double as a primer while also moisturising the skin. Australia has some of the most rigorous testing standards in the world when it comes to sunscreen (a report has found that two-thirds of sunscreens in the US offer suboptimal protection) so you can be assured of potency and efficacy. Try this melanoma predictor Early detection is crucial when it comes to skin cancer, so get in the habit of checking your skin regularly. Check your skin (undress to ensure you can examine your body thoroughly) for new spots or changes to existing moles and freckles such as a change in colour, diameter, symmetry, a spreading or irregular edge, or spots that seem to be changing and growing. Want to know your risk of developing melanoma in the next 3.5 years? Try this predictor, which has been created using data from the largest research study ever done on skin cancer. Don\u2019t go thirsty Heat-related health conditions and illnesses, from dehydration to heat exhaustion and heatstroke, which can be life threatening, are particularly prevalent during summer due to soaring temperatures, which means staying hydrated is never more important. Often, by the time you feel thirsty you\u2019re already dehydrated, so it\u2019s important to drink plenty of water throughout the day, particularly if you\u2019ve been sweating a lot, as you\u2019ll need to replace any fluids lost. Sleek and slide The slip, slop, slap message has become iconic in Australia since its introduction in the 1980s and is still prevalent today - albeit with a few more steps included. These days it\u2019s all about slip (on some sun-protective clothing), slop (on a broad spectrum, water-resistant SPF30 or higher sunscreen), slap (on a hat), seek (shade from the sun) and slide (on some sunglasses).
