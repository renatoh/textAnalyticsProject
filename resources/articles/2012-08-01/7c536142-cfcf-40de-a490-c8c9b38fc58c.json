Scotland Yard, confronted, deals fully with this scenario. Its statement, considered, nuanced, is: \"No.\" Still we do know that they fret about the possibility that Assange might escape. And one need only turn to the book WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy, written by Guardian colleagues David Leigh and Luke Harding, to be alive to the possibilities. For chapter one tells of a two-hour journey from London to Norfolk taken by a woman with a crooked frame, a big coat and features obscured by a makeshift hairpiece. She/he was Assange, escaping to a bolthole without detection, for he/she is notably resourceful. Might be too foxy for William Hague. \u2022 But if he slips away \u2013 whether disguised as Jessie J or smuggled out with the washing \u2013 we know that police will be stretching every sinew to catch up with him. Officers are on a state of high alert, pursuing every possibility. And it was, no doubt as part of this effort, that recently a fellow of our acquaintance \u2013 of high profession, fine character and high repute \u2013 was approached by two officers on a train which set out from London Paddington. Excuse us, sir, but we believe there is a warrant out for your arrest, they said. No there isn't, he replied, but who is it that you think I am? Julian Assange, they said, flashing warrant cards and accompanying him from the train to establish his bona fides. All ended amicably, but there'll be worse in days to come. They'll be pulling on noses, opening coats, lifting wigs. \u2022 Much joy, meanwhile, as campaigners for gay marriage gain another high profile recruit, the mayor of London, Boris Johnson. I see no reason why the happy state of marriage should be denied anyone, he says in a supportive message posted on YouTube, which never mentions the words gay or lesbian. \"That's why I'm supporting Out4Marriage.\" And this is good, very good; much better than his previous position, that \"if gay marriage was OK \u2013 and I was uncertain on the issue \u2013 then I saw no reason in principle why a union should not be consecrated between three men, as well as two men; or indeed three men and a dog\". Shows maturity. Don't knock it. \u2022 The exam results are out. The school playing fields row is raging. But there have not been as many televised sightings of the education secretary/hero of the Tory right Michael Gove as one might expect. This is a pity. Panto isn't panto without the villain. We should see more of him, and the wicked word in Whitehall is that we would but for the fact that the endless round of official dinners and similar sacrifices have caused him to become a bit pudgy and a little self-conscious. Perhaps the cabinet should make PE compulsory. \u2022 Finally, we recall what made us fond of David Mellor \u2013 former minister of fun, more recently the PR voice for the head-crackers of Bahrain. His wiles are described in the new memoir by the former home secretary David Waddington. Mellor was a junior minister under Waddington at the time of a reshuffle. Thatcher decided that John Patten, another junior minister, should become minister for the arts. But Patten neither knew or cared for the arts, and anyway, Waddington needed him. So Waddington suggested Mellor. He became \"quite apoplectic\", writes Waddington. \"It was an insult to offer him such a dead-end job.\" The home secretary went into a meeting, only to be called from it to speak to Mellor again. \"He was still waxing indignant and saying he was not prepared to take the job. I got cross and went back to my meeting.\" Half an hour later, however, Waddington turned on the TV. \"There was David before the cameras, saying what a great honour had been bestowed on him \u2013 that minister for the arts was the job he had always wanted and he was the happiest man alive. I thought it very sporting of him in the circumstances and proved what a grand trooper he was.\" Then, as now, flexible, quick witted.
