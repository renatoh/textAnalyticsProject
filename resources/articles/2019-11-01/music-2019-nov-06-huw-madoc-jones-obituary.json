The choir, a male voice ensemble, was established in Swansea, south Wales, in 1935 \u2013 and Huw was regarded as one of the finest chairmen in its history; indeed, he held the post a record six times. A champion of the Welsh language and Welsh male voice choirs, Huw was delighted to receive his 40 years of service award and life membership of the choir at our 2019 annual gala concert. Born in Pontypridd, to Thomas Madoc-Jones, an RAF chaplain, and Jenny (nee Humphreys), a hospital matron, Huw attended the Barry county school for boys and went on to study modern languages at the University of Manchester. Huw followed in his father\u2019s footsteps and joined the RAF in 1950, travelling widely \u2013 to Singapore, Berlin, Moscow and elsewhere \u2013 and becoming a group captain. On his first trip to Germany, his negotiating skills \u2013 and knowledge of languages: he spoke five \u2013 came to the fore when a bunch of disgruntled Soviet troops, who had been threatening Huw and his colleagues with rifles moments earlier, were persuaded to sing and dance with them instead. Huw retired from the RAF in 1979 and settled on the Gower Peninsula, working in Swansea for the Regular Forces Employment Association, and then for a life insurance company. He joined the Morriston Orpheus Choir in 1979. Both he and his wife, Norma (nee Kemp), whom Huw married in 1953, were involved with Mocsa (the Morriston Orpheus Choir supporters\u2019 association), supporting and raising funds for the choir. Norma was responsible for the blue woven choir banner seen on stage at every Orpheus concert. Huw was active in the continuing development and day-to-day running of Mocsa, even when his health was failing. The last souvenir programme Huw created was for the organisation\u2019s 2018 Young Welsh Singer of the Year competition, and he remained an active committee member to the end. He always gave new choristers the warmest of welcomes \u2013 and knew the choir\u2019s rules by heart. His beaming smile and kindly tone will be remembered by many hundreds of choristers, choir fans and Mocsa Young Welsh singers of the Year. During his four decades of service, Huw helped nurture, shape and guide the Morriston Orpheus Choir. He was a great friend to us all. Norma died in 1990. He is survived by his children, Gwynfa and David, and three grandchildren, Christopher, James and Catrin. Another daughter, Anne, died in 2009, and Amy, a granddaughter, in 1988."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
