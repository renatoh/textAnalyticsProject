Caroline Criado-Perez, who successfully campaigned to have a picture of Jane Austen on the new \u00a310 note, made the comments after the CPS said two people would be charged in relation to allegedly abusive tweets that were sent to her. Three others would not face charges, the CPS said. Criado-Perez accused prosecutors of reneging on an agreement to contact her to inform her of their decision before releasing it publicly. \"I am upset, we agreed a procedure,\" she said on Monday night. \"I found out from people on Twitter that charges were to be brought. I do not know who has been released and I would have thought that was information I should have had. \"I can't tell you anything other than what the press release tells you. The CPS will be receiving a formal complaint because the way they have handled it is appalling.\" She said that CPS staff had agreed to call her at 1pm last Friday but did not. Another promise to speak to her on Monday had not been kept either, she said. Despite the CPS saying in a statement released on Monday afternoon that it had already written to her, Criado-Perez said she had received no communication whatsoever until about 8.45pm. In the statement, the CPS said that a man and a woman would be charged with improper use of a communications network. However, it would not be in the public interest to prosecute over messages allegedly sent to the Labour MP Stella Creasy, it added. In a tweet posted earlier in the day, Criado-Perez wrote: \"Well that's pretty awesome. CPS informing press about charges ahead of me. About the level of victim-support I've grown to expect.\" Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow, was said to have been targeted after she came to the defence of Criado-Perez, a freelance journalist who allegedly received an \"avalanche\" of abuse after leading a campaign for women to be featured on banknotes. Twitter faced questions about the way it handled the issue. Baljit Ubhey, chief crown prosecutor for CPS London, said: \"Following early consultation with the police, the CPS has been asked to make a charging decision in respect of five suspects whom it is alleged sent offensive tweets to Stella Creasy MP, and journalist and campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez. \"We reviewed these cases in accordance with the code for crown prosecutors and guidelines issued by the director of public prosecutions on prosecuting cases involving communications sent via social media. \"After careful consideration of all the available evidence, the CPS has today authorised the Metropolitan police to charge two suspects in relation to messages allegedly sent to Caroline Criado-Perez. \"Isabella Sorley, 23, from Newcastle and John Nimmo, 25, from South Shields, have both been charged with improper use of a communications network under Section 127 of the Communications Act. \"We have also determined there is insufficient evidence to support a prosecution in respect of one suspect, whom it was alleged also sent offensive messages to Ms Criado-Perez, and have advised the police that no further action should be taken as the high threshold for prosecution has not been met. \"In respect of one other suspect, who allegedly sent offensive messages to Stella Creasy MP, we determined that although there was sufficient evidence that an offence had been committed under Section 127 of the Communications Act, it would not be in the public interest to prosecute, having applied the director's guidelines and having particular regard to the young age and personal circumstances of the suspect. \"In relation to the fifth suspect, we have asked the police to carry out further investigation before a charging decision can be made. \"We have written to both Ms Creasy and Ms Criado-Perez to inform them of these decisions.\" The two people charged will appear at Westminster magistrates court on 7 January, a Metropolitan police spokesman said. A CPS spokesman did not respond to requests for comment on Criado-Perez's complaint."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
