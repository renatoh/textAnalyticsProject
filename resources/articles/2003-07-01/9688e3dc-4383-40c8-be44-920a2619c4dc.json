The sale, which is subject to veterinary clearance, came after the southern-hemisphere three-year-old - who had to shoulder the weight of a four-year-old in Britain because of the different foaling seasons - went down to his first defeat here on Thursday when Oasis Dream caught him in the final furlong of the July Cup at Newmarket, a European sprint championship race. The giant son of the rising stallion star Danehill Dancer will now go into quarantine in Ireland before launching his new dual-hemisphere career back home, shuttling from County Tipperary to Coolmore Australia for the upcoming stud season. Few financial details have not been disclosed, but it is thought he will stand at the Hunter Valley operation in New South Wales at a fee of some \u00a314,000. Choisir, a Group One winner in Australia, arrived totally unheralded here but stormed to victory in the Group Two King's Stand Stakes over five furlongs and again in record time in the six-furlong Group One Golden Jubilee Stakes to become first horse to land the Royal Ascot sprint double since Diadem back in 1920. Coolmore's Christy Grassick said: \"A really strongly made colt from the sire-producing Danehill line, I think he'll prove very popular with commercial breeders, both here in Ireland and in Australia. We're delighted to have got him.\" Coolmore Australia's general manager Michael Kirwan said: \"He is a wonderful type whose great performances at Royal Ascot and Newmarket have done more for Australian racing than any horse since Phar Lap.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
