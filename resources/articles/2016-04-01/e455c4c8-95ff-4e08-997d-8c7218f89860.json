Baba Ramdev, dressed in the saffron robes of a Hindu saint, sits upright, cross-legged, breathing rapidly to move his diaphragm with all the skill of a yoga master. In the background, a voice lists the benefits of the swami\u2019s Hindu lifestyle. Then the scene changes to a boy bathing with bodywash from the swami\u2019s Patanjali range of bathroom products, which includes shampoos, toothpaste and hair oil. Ramdev\u2019s endorsement means big bucks in contemporary India. His brand of bodywash is in stores nationwide and has quickly come to compete with long-established brands such as Dove and Nivea. The swami regularly appears on billboards and television shows to recommend his products to his millions of followers. In the past few years Ramdev has become a national business icon, selling hundreds of products from biscuits to aloe vera juice, all claiming to be Indian-made and good for health. He surged to popularity as a yoga teacher in the past decade, bringing the discipline to the masses on his 24-hour television channel, Aastha. His rise has been accompanied by a revival of Hindu nationalist sentiment in rapidly modernising India. In recent years Ramdev has shared the stage with the prime minister, Narendra Modi, urging supporters to vote for the Hindu nationalist BJP during the election campaign. Modi, who has recognised the brand value of new-age gurus, has associated closely with a string of holy men, including Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, whose \u201cArt of Living\u201d event in Delhi last month drew millions of followers. Baba Ramdev has been given the government\u2019s highest level of security protection, and was recently invited by Modi to inaugurate his flagship International Yoga Day. Over the past year, Patanjali estimates it made a total revenue of \u00a3530m, more than double its takings the previous year. Ramdev is leading a new generation of business-savvy ascetics in India who are using their spiritual capital to take on the giants of the retail world. Patanjali\u2019s products are cheap, Ramdev says, because the company sources its materials locally, and because the holy man\u2019s legion of followers are an easy market to tap into. At Big Bazaar in Mumbai, yoga teacher Shanoo Chimulkar has come to buy his favourite Patanjali biscuits and honey. \u201cHe\u2019s really doing a good job,\u201d he says, filling his trolley. \u201cIf you say \u2018yoga\u2019, people think \u2018Ramdev\u2019, and he\u2019s using his popularity to teach people about healthy living.\u201d Chimulkar swears by Ramdev\u2019s products because they are made from local ingredients. \u201cWhen companies came from outside and started selling in India, that\u2019s when new health problems like diabetes and cholesterol started appearing. People should stick to our traditional way of life.\u201d Other shoppers are more sceptical. One man approaches a display of Patanjali products to see what the fuss is about. \u201cI find him absolutely repulsive,\u201d he says. \u201cBut everybody\u2019s talking about him so I\u2019ve come to see for myself.\u201d A store manager says that the Patanjali range has caught the imagination, and a broad range of Indians are experimenting with Ramdev\u2019s products: \u201cAll kinds of people are buying Patanjali, regardless of their social class. The products have an advantage because they are cheaper than other brands, but whether the quality is the same, I can\u2019t tell you.\u201d The company has come under scrutiny in parliament recently. Reports of worms and high levels of monosodium glutamate in Ramdev\u2019s instant noodles sparked controversy last year after a food standards authority said the product never received its approval. Another product called Putrajeevak Beej, which claims to improve women\u2019s fertility, has come under fire for suggesting it could help couples who want sons rather than daughters. Ramdev\u2019s claims that his products can reduce the risk of conditions such as diabetes and Aids have also prompted criticism. Unsurprisingly, Ramdev\u2019s commercial rise has also provoked criticism from other holy men. A rival ascetic, Swami Agnivesh, criticised Ramdev in an editorial published in the Indian Express last week. He wrote: \u201cRamdev has been in the business of converting spirituality into material profit \u2026 Religion became, in the process, the means for indulging in covetousness. The mega bucks he earned became his entry into politics.\u201d But the Ramdev name still carries power. Harish Bijoor, a brand strategist, says the name has \u201csent the shivers out in corporate boardrooms in India\u201d. According to Bijoor, the brand is set to dwarf its competitors because of Ramdev\u2019s smart marketing tactics. \u201cHe wears saffron,\u201d Bijoor explains, a colour that is closely associated with the Hindu religion. \u201cThat\u2019s a colour that is the flavour of the decade in India today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
