The West Ham manager admitted the sacking of Frank de Boer by Crystal Palace earlier on Monday had been \u201cin the back of my mind\u201d before the match. On the night, West Ham United did not look like a team of experienced, expensively recruited players. Their style was disjointed, their shape questionable. But in terms of fight and determination, Slaven Bilic\u2019s side gave their all in the sort of performance you might associate with a far less glamorous side \u2013 a Huddersfield Town perhaps. In the end it was enough to take three points. A deflected strike from Pedro Obiang was followed by Andr\u00e9 Ayew\u2019s six-yard finish as West Ham cracked open a tightly contested encounter in the final 20 minutes. The Huddersfield manager, David Wagner, was disappointed in his team, who were organised in defence but rarely threatened going forward. West Ham\u2019s manager, meanwhile, was delighted. The game was scrappy and lacked quality but his team\u2019s performance offered up half a dozen decent chances. On Bilic\u2019s 49th birthday and after three consecutive demoralising defeats, this was a welcome gift. \u201cThey gave everything,\u201d Bilic said. \u201cIt was a top performance from us, not in the sense we played beautiful football but in other aspects. Determination in executing the game plan, in stopping them from doing anything. \u201cI\u2019m 49 and I\u2019ve been in serious football for 31 years,\u201d Bilic added. \u201cI know how it goes, especially today, and I\u2019m not going to lie, [De Boer] was in the back of my mind. But I\u2019ve come to the zone where I don\u2019t care about that. I care about the team. I saw my team really focus, not just today but yesterday, the day before.\u201d \u201cIt was a deserved defeat,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cDefensively we were OK, we were aware of the direct style. We got the flicks, we were good on the second balls but football is also an offensive game and offensively we weren\u2019t good enough. We made so many unforced errors, bad decisions. It makes totally no sense to play without bravery and confidence especially after what the boys have done in the past. We haven\u2019t shown what we are capable of.\u201d Wagner\u2019s criticisms could have been equally applicable to the hosts. West Ham were making their first home appearance of the season and had adopted a new formation. Bilic, acting to plug the leaks that had led to his team accruing a goal difference of minus eight, had shifted to a back three, with James Collins returning to the team. Up front there was room for both Javier Hern\u00e1ndez and Andy Carroll, the England striker making his first start in five months. With Michail Antonio also in attack it was an unfamiliar and often uncertain formation, one held together by individual gumption. That said, it created chances and West Ham could have been ahead after only two minutes. A floated cross from the right found Carroll at the back post. Instead of heading, however, he opted to drop off his man and took the ball on his chest. Carroll then flashed the ball across goal but a sliding Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 could not turn it over the line even from inches away. Ten minutes later and another clear opportunity came the home side\u2019s way. This time it was all of Antonio\u2019s making as he powered past Chris L\u00f6we and again managed to cut the ball back across the box. This time the cross skewed to Hern\u00e1ndez but the Mexican poacher crashed his shot off the bar. With five minutes of the half remaining, they crafted another opportunity, Carroll forcing Mathias Jorgensen into a weak clearing header only for Kouyat\u00e9, standing on the penalty spot, to make a complete hash of his shot. For all that Wagner was down on his team for a lack of assertiveness, Huddersfield began to come into the game in the second half. They started to throw more numbers forward. Philip Billing forced Joe Hart into his first save in the 54th minute. On the hour they eked out their first corner. At the other end West Ham were starting to look ragged. Hern\u00e1ndez in particular was struggling in an unusual position at inside-forward. He was trying his best and twice tried to slide in the hard running Antonio but neither opening resulted in a shot. With 25 minutes remaining he was removed in favour of Ayew and it turned out to be the spark that changed the game. In the 72nd minute the Ghana forward found Obiang just outside the penalty box. The midfielder unleashed a fierce, left-foot shot which hit Jorgensen, who had turned his back on it, and was deflected well over his goalkeeper Jonas L\u00f6ssl and into the net. Five minutes later Ayew was on hand to force home another Aaron Cresswell corner. The relief in the stadium was palpable. Bilic jumped up and down like a birthday boy about to unwrap his presents. After victory was sealed, Bilic sought to clarify remarks he had made about his chairman, David Sullivan, who had claimed the Croat had turned down the chance to sign Renato Sanches and Grzegorz Krychowiak. \u201cI\u2019ve said some things. I said them and I wasn\u2019t drunk,\u201d Bilic said. \u201cI said nothing bad about the chairman, on the contrary I said we\u2019d done good business. I defended him and just wanted to clear the situation with Sanches and Krychowiak. I didn\u2019t want those players.\u201d Bilic added that, after a troubled year, the London Stadium was starting to feel like home. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t wait to play here again,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the situation now. It will never be Upton Park but it doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be our home. I really have a feeling and I see the players that we like it more and more here. That can only come with good results and good individual performances.\u201d He achieved the former in this match, at least."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
