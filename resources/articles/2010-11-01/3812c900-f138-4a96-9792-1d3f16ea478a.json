A lot of people are really angry that if you're hoping to go to one of the top universities you might not be able to afford the fees, or you might end up in a lot of debt afterwards. We're going to be the first generation of students to be given this rise in fees and we need to have our voices heard, and there's no other way to do it without disobeying. A couple of us went to Goldsmiths to meet some of the students who demonstrated the other week and it was great, there was a really great atmosphere, and they said they were really inspired by what we're doing. In a way they're fighting for us. And we've had support from other schools, and there's another school who are planning to do this too, a 6th form college in Greenwich. The teachers should be proud of us, we're standing up for our right to higher education, and we feel really strongly about it. I don't know if they'll take any action to stop us. I think it's against the law to walk out of school, but we're fighting for education so that might make them feel differently. I've never done anything like this before but it feels really brilliant to have some say in it all, to have some power over what's going on. We've had students who say this isn't going to get you anywhere. But where do they think saying 'this won't get you anywhere' is going to get them?\" Interview: Bibi van der Zee"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
