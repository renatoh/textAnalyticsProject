The news comes amid a humanitarian crisis that could forcibly displace as many as 8.2 million people by the end of 2020, and the same month that the United Nations accused the Venezuelan government of killing thousands of its own citizens. In a letter released on Tuesday, the acting US Citizenship and Immigration Services director, Ken Cuccinelli, said the administration was not willing to grant temporary protected status (TPS) to Venezuelans. \u201cAs it relates to Venezuela,\u201d Cuccinelli wrote in the letter, addressed to the Senate minority leader, Dick Durbin, \u201cthe US Government continues to monitor the situation in Venezuela.\u201d Venezuela is now the leading country of origin for asylum seekers in the United States, with nearly 30,000 Venezuelans applying for protection in 2018. The TPS program is designed to prevent foreign nationals from being deported back to countries facing civil unrest or the aftermath of a devastating natural disaster. It has also been a target of the White House, which has sought to terminate TPS for migrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan. \u201cVenezuela is exactly the sort of situation that TPS was designed to address,\u201d said Charanya Krishnaswami, Americas advocacy director at Amnesty International. Donald Trump has presented himself as a steadfast opponent of the Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and most prominent supporter of his opponent Juan Guaid\u00f3, but his administration continues to deport Venezuelans to their homeland. Between October 2017 and September 2018, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported 336 Venezuelan citizens. \u201cAt the same time the government is saying it needs to monitor the situation more, administration officials are calling the government of Maduro a \u2018thugocracy\u2019, and decrying the humanitarian situation that so many Venezuelans are facing,\u201d Krishnaswami added. In a joint response to the administration\u2019s letter, Senators Durbin and Bob Menendez said the president \u201ccannot have it both ways. He cannot warn Americans that Venezuela is so dangerous they should avoid traveling there and then turn around and tell Venezuelans in the US they are forced to return.\u201d A USCIS representative insisted that \u201cthe letter is being misinterpreted\u201d, noting that, ultimately, a TPS designation \u201cis a decision made by the Secretary of Homeland Security\u201d. N\u00e9stor Guill\u00e9n, a Venezuelan green-card holder in the US since 2006, said the disparity between US rhetoric and action reflects \u201chypocrisy and opportunism\u201d by an electorally minded Republican party. \u201cTPS is the lowest-hanging fruit by which we can help Venezuelans in the short term,\u201d he said. The Trump administration is \u201cselling snake oil, not lending humanitarian assistance\u201d. Refusing to grant TPS \u201csends the absolute wrong message to Venezuelans, and to the rest of Latin America\u201d, said Geoff Ramsey of the Washington Office on Latin America. \u201cIt\u2019s as if this administration\u2019s concern for Venezuelans ends the instant they leave their country.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
