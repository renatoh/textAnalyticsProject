The Australian is out of contract at Middlesbrough this summer, and this week offered the most mystical of reasons as to why he is still lingering over a decision on his future. \"I'm a Libran,\" he told reporters, \"and we like to procrastinate. We like to chill and see how things pan out.\" Admittedly, as a means of deciding upon the most auspicious course of action, astrology has advantages over other methods of divination. It seems a positive, for instance, that Mark does not rely on icthyomancy - divination by observing the movement of fish in water - or the even more arcane practice of tyromancy: divination by observing the manner in which cheese curdles. And in our body image-obsessed culture, the big-boned striker's courage in making even oblique reference to a set of weighing scales should be applauded. Nor is he alone in his dedication to that least charlatan of disciplines. The France coach, Raymond Domenech, doesn't like picking Scorpios. Doesn't trust them. Similarly, Big Phil Scolari has admitted to consulting astrologers before big games. And in the run-up to the World Cup, some found it a matter of note that there was a preponderance of Aquarians in the England squad, although the subsequent meltdown has yet to be conclusively blamed on the retention of too many water carriers. But will Mark's reliance on ancient superstition set him on a collision course with his prospective future boss, Sam Allardyce, whose devotion to scientific principles seems the antithesis of this approach - unless I missed the chapter in Moneyball, the baseball book, dealing with what happened to the Oakland As when the moon moved into Sagittarius? Indeed, given their contrasting methodologies, should rumoured approaches from Portsmouth and West Ham be given more credence than overtures from St James' Park? Clearly, the definitive answer is to be found in the stars, so as a rare foray into service journalism, this column has undertaken to pick through the recent thoughts of this great country's foremost astrologers, to see what the future might hold for our deliberating hero. On Monday, the day of Viduka's astrological revelation, occasionally coherent Daily Mail stargazer Jonathan Cainer was urging caution. \"Is the world your oyster?\" he asked pointedly of Mark and less relevant Librans. \"Perhaps. But not every oyster contains a pearl. Maybe you have set out on a fruitless fishing mission. Maybe your confidence is misplaced. The sky, though, doesn't seem to think so. It appears to feel you deserve the best\" - evidently under the impression that Manchester United were in the market for a 31-year-old striker -\"and it has a cosmic duty to ensure you get it.\" In the Sun, Mystic Meg cemented her reputation for idiosyncrasy by appearing to recommend a move to Watford. \"The word, or the colour, gold is lucky for you and the family.\" By Tuesday, her ire had been stirred by reports suggesting Harry Redknapp's overtures were the ones to heed. \"Mind-clearing Mercury shines the light on your truth chart so you can separate fact from gossip. This will help you make all the right moves . . . Luck has a link with Spain.\" Blimey. Does it? Less optimistic was the Mirror's Debbie Frank, whose worryingly sympathetic tone on Monday - \"Keep imagining yourself in a strong position\" - had modulated into a stark warning for Viduka by Tuesday. \"You could go off in the wrong direction. There's a lot of potential around you . . . if you can make the most of your ability.\" But what of the Daily Express's Justin Toper? \"No matter how reasonable you've been lately,\" he observed archly, \"Mars moving into Aries is like a tornado. But you'll end up a winner, if not a lot better off financially - well, that's the theory.\" Justin seemed somewhat self-doubting, as is only fitting for the man who was famously sacked by Kelvin MacKenzie with the observation that he'd have seen the P45 coming. The celestial omens, however, are in constant flux, and by yesterday Meg appeared to be coming full circle, advising Mark that \"Working with someone who seems to be your opposite in every way brings luck to you\". Newcastle it is then, and we wish our stargazy striker the best of luck - though evidently, chance does not come into it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
