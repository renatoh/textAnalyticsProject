This one is different, though \u2013 it is home to L&amp;D Hospital Radio, which broadcasts to patients through bedside units, to locals on AM and to the entire planet online. The door is answered by Glyn Davies, a semi-retired accident management specialist and the longstanding station manager. He gives me a quick tour. I see a framed, signed Emma Bunton solo album, as well as signed memorabilia from David Tennant, Midge Ure and Sir Steve Redgrave. A computer monitor is shrouded in an Iceland carrier bag, at the suggestion of Glyn's OCD brother-in-law, who looks after IT. Studio 1 is occupied \u2013 afternoon host Jakki Bak is broadcasting \u2013 so Glyn shows me the setup in Studio 2, formerly the bungalow's front room. He pushes up a fader on one of the desks and Please Don't Go by KWS comes blasting out. Glyn accepts that the role of hospital radio has changed since he joined the station 33 years ago, hosting a Saturday night show. Many patients arrive with their own entertainment loaded on to iPads, but Glyn stresses that, for those who stay longer, L&amp;D offers an important sense of community. L&amp;D's is a modest set-up, but their permanent home suits them well \u2013 at one point they worked out of a room so small that it was subsequently converted into a toilet. \"We've moved around a lot but \u2013 touch wood \u2013 we've kept going,\" Glyn says. He reaches for the nearest doorframe to touch wood, but it's uPVC. The station's chairman, Mike Ollivier, arrives. He explains a little about the station's finances. Around 50 volunteers each pay \u00a330 per year to be involved, and the station needs about \u00a33,000 a year more to stay on air. It's raised through bucket shakes outside supermarkets, plus the occasional disco and social event. The local Rotary Club recently made L&amp;D Radio a charity of the year. \"That was particularly nice,\" says Mike, \"because we got a rather good roast lunch at the local golf club, with a glass of wine to go with it.\" Never say no to a free lunch, I say, although I don't think Mike says no to many free lunches. He and Glyn make quite the double act, and while Glyn is dealing with a delivery, Mike talks about the pair's relationship. \"He's put a lot of time in and it's very much his baby,\" he begins. \"Which \u2026 \" Mike embarks on an epic pause. The silence is roughly long enough for someone to say, \"There is an epic pause at this point.\" Eventually, the pause ends. \" \u2026 can sometimes cause issues. He can forget that we're all in it together and tries to dictate a little more than he should.\" Glyn returns and talks me through some of L&amp;D's successful graduates, who've gone on to produce for Capital, Heart and the BBC. The station has also attracted celebrity guests. \"We've had Chris Tarrant, Esther Rantzen, all sorts,\" Glyn says. He tells an extremely long story about Paul Daniels which ends with the line, \"He turned round, said, 'That's magic,' got in his Shogun and drove off.\" I visit Jakki and we chat while records play. She tells me that she's a postie in nearby Leighton Buzzard and drifted towards L&amp;D Radio three years ago, after she visited her mother in hospital and saw the station's suggestions box. \"I lost my mother, which was a massive blow,\" she says. \"I lost a lot of self-esteem and confidence. I had a lot of doubt about whether I could do something outside my comfort zone, but as soon as I walk in this door something comes over me and I'm a different person.\" Jakki's a natural, very relaxed broadcaster who hopes one day to make a living from radio, but she hasn't had any feedback after making contact with local stations. \"I'll just have to keep sending out the demos,\" she shrugs. Mike and Glyn are chatting about something on the other side of the glass. Have they ever had an argument? Jakki grins. \"Bill and Ben?\" She peers through the window. \"I think they may have clashed in the past \u2026 \" Later, I ask them directly if they've ever fallen out. \"Quite frequently,\" Mike breezily declares. \"But we still talk to each other.\" \"Well,\" Glyn objects, \"you say 'fallen out' \u2026 \" \"We've agreed to disagree,\" Mike agrees to disagree. \"I think Mike and Alan, one of our trustees, are probably more level-headed than what I am,\" Glyn accepts. \"I want to push forward. They pull back on the reins. And what people don't realise is that there's health and safety! There's the law on broadcasting! And Alan turns up two minutes before his programme! I don't think that's the way to do it. When I did my show, I had scripts! We're not professionals, no, but that doesn't mean we have to be crap at what we do. After 33 years on the station I still believe that.\" Mike gives me a lift to Luton train station. \"We'll try to keep going long enough to still be on air when you publish,\" he chortles. \"Give it three weeks,\" I say. Three weeks later, I tune in online. L&amp;D is, indeed, still on air. They're playing Show Me The Meaning Of Being Lonely by Backstreet Boys. I imagine I am lying alone in a hospital bed, and I feel quite unhappy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
