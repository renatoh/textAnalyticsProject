Intergenerational report With the release of the much anticipated 2015 Intergenerational report, the Abbott government has warned of a debt crisis unless parliament agreed to a series of yet-to-be-legislated budget measures. But knocking you off your chair? It\u2019s really not very scary, writes Lenore Taylor. Hockey\u2019s alarmist comments ignore findings which show that living standards will rise for 40 years, more women will find work and spending is being curbed. As he tries to reset the budget debate and push for bipartisanship, Tony Abbott has appealed to Labor\u2019s \u201cbetter angels\u201d after the intergenerational report was released. Economist John Quiggin says the Intergenerational report is redundant and Hockey should abandon it: \u201cNothing is easier than to make a forecast look scary when you are projecting 40 years into the future and you get to choose the parameters that suit your case\u201d This year\u2019s report is mostly silent on the economic effects of climate change \u2013 a stark contrast to the 2010 report that declared climate change \u201cthe largest and most significant challenge to Australia\u2019s environment\u201d, with \u201csevere\u201d consequences for the economy, water availability and Australia\u2019s unique environment. Shadow treasurer Chris Bowen has slammed the intergenerational report as a work of fiction. Bali Nine The Australian government is lodging an official complaint with Indonesia about the treatment of death-row citizens Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran \u2013 for this photo of a smiling police chief posing with Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran while being transferred for their imminent executions, but also for the disproportionate show of force in their transfer. Indonesia\u2019s attorney general says Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will be told their execution date \u2018in a few days\u2019, but this morning added their death sentences cannot be carried out this week. His comment comes after Julie Bishop confirmed floating the idea of a prisoner swap in \u2018tense call\u2019 with her Indonesian counterpart. The offer was rejected.

The peak body for Indigenous legal services will shut its doors after being denied a portion of $680m in federal government funding under the Indigenous advancement strategy (IAS) grants scheme. Football star Karmichael Hunt yesterday pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine, but Guardian Australia can exclusively reveal that Queensland\u2019s Crime and Corruption Commission originally used an obscure legal \u2018fiction\u2019 to charge Hunt with supplying cocaine to himself. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is suing the maker of the painkiller Nurofen for false claims after its varieties for back pain, period pain, migraine pain and tension headaches were found to be exactly the same product. Cadbury has withdrawn its application for $16m in federal funding, saying the grant requirements were too onerous. Around the world The US ambassador to South Korea, Mark Lippert, has been left with 11cm-long facial wounds after he was slashed by a political extremist armed with a razor at a function in Seoul. North Korea described the wounding as \u201cjust punishment\u201d for joint US-South Korea military drills.
