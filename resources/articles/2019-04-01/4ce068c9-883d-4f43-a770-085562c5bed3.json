Trump retweeted his message on Saturday. Omar thanked supporters for standing \u201cagainst an administration that ran on banning Muslims from this country\u201d. \u201cNo one person \u2013 no matter how corrupt, inept, or vicious \u2013 can threaten my unwavering love for America,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cI stand undeterred to continue fighting for equal opportunity in our pursuit of happiness for all Americans.\u201d In the hours after the president attacked Omar, who came to the US from Somalia as a refugee and became one of the first Muslim women in Congress, progressive Democrats condemned the president for \u201cinciting violence\u201d against her. Just last week, a Trump supporter from New York state was charged with threatening to kill Omar. But while presidential candidates rallied behind Omar, House leaders did not immediately take the same approach. Leadership and some freshmen Democrats have disagreed over how to respond to attacks on Omar, including accusations that her criticism of US policy on Israel was antisemitic. Last month, Omar apologized \u201cunequivocally\u201d after suggesting support for Israel was fueled by donations from a lobby group. On Saturday morning, Speaker Nancy Pelosi hedged her response to Trump\u2019s tweet, saying \u201cthe president shouldn\u2019t use the painful images of 9/11 for a political attack\u201d but not mentioning Omar. \u201cThe memory of 9/11 is sacred ground, and any discussion of it must be done with reverence,\u201d Pelosi wrote, a comment that could be read as a criticism of Omar as well as the president. \u201cIt is wrong for the president, as commander-in-chief, to fan the flames to make anyone less safe.\u201d Trump tweeted \u201cWE WILL NEVER FORGET!\u201d with a video edited to suggest Omar was dismissive of the attacks. The video used part of a speech last month to the Council on American-Islamic Relations in which Omar discussed the problem of Islamophobia, describing \u201cthe discomfort of being a second-class citizen\u201d. After September 11, she said, advocates \u201crecognized that some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties\u201d. Rightwing politicians were quick to say Omar was dismissing the gravity of 9/11. Dan Crenshaw, a congressman from Texas who as a Navy Seal was seriously injured in Afghanistan, falsely claimed Omar \u201cdoes not consider [September 11] a terrorist attack on the USA by terrorists\u201d. Two of the most progressive candidates for the Democratic nomination called on all lawmakers to condemn such attacks. Senator Bernie Sanders called attacks on Omar \u201cdisgusting and dangerous\u201d and said Omar would not \u201cback down to Trump\u2019s racism and hate, and neither will we\u201d. Senator Elizabeth Warren said: \u201cThe president is inciting violence against a sitting congresswoman \u2013 and an entire group of Americans based on their religion. It\u2019s disgusting. It\u2019s shameful. And any elected leader who refuses to condemn it shares responsibility for it.\u201d Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana who has surged in 2020 polls, wrote: \u201cAfter 9/11 we all said we were changed. That we were stronger and more united. That\u2019s what \u2018never forget\u2019 was about. Now, a president uses that dark day to incite his base against a member of Congress, as if for sport. As if we learned nothing that day about the workings of hate.\u201d Buttigieg added: \u201cThe threats against the life of [Omar] make clear what is at stake.\u201d Among other candidates, former Hud secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro said he stood with Omar and \u201cothers targeted by the president\u2019s anti-Muslim rhetoric\u201d. Former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke said: \u201cWe are stronger than this president\u2019s hatred and Islamophobia. Do not let him drive us apart or make us afraid.\u201d The California senator Kamala Harris wrote: \u201cFor two years, this president has used the most powerful platform in the world to sow hate [and] division. Putting the safety of a sitting member of Congress at risk [and] vilifying a whole religion is beyond the pale. I\u2019ll be blunt \u2013 we must defeat him.\u201d Fox News and the New York Post, owned by Rupert Murdoch, have devoted high-profile coverage to misleading claims about Omar\u2019s words. Republican party chair Ronna McDaniel has also attacked the congresswoman. Rashida Tlaib, the other Muslim American woman in Congress, was the first on Friday to call for Democrats to \u201cspeak up\u201d in return. \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNo more silence, with NY Post and now Trump taking Ilhan\u2019s words out of context to incite violence toward her, it\u2019s time for more Dems to speak up. Clearly the GOP is fine with this shameful stunt, but we cannot stand by.\u201d Trump\u2019s own comments and falsehoods about September 11 have long attracted criticism. He has repeated false claims about \u201cthousands and thousands of\u201d Muslims in New Jersey celebrating on the day itself; his business received money meant for small businesses affected by the attack, even though his businesses were not; he has claimed to have helped clear rubble from the attack site, a claim for which evidence does not exist; he has said he watched people jump from the World Trade Center towers from Trump Tower, four miles away, which would not be possible. Perhaps most famously, in an interview hours after the attack on the World Trade Center, part of attacks in which 2,977 people were killed, Trump described his shock and disbelief. Then he added a comment that left his interviewers \u201cstunned\u201d. Trump, claimed, falsely, that one of his own buildings had been \u201cthe second-tallest building in downtown Manhattan\u201d, after the World Trade Center. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s the tallest,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
