While I was booking the website crashed - the money was paid out of my account but easyJet did not take the booking. It took over 48 hours to get in touch with customer services, which had no trace of the booking and referred me to my credit card company. A week later I eventually got the whole \u00a3880 back, but when I went to book the flights again the prices had gone up to \u00a31,230! This has had an enormous effect on the budget and we have had to use some money out of the school's emergency fund to cover the cost of the visit without asking parents to pay extra. The headmaster has written to easyJet on my behalf, but its reply was far from helpful. We hoped it would acknowledge its mistake and offer some support. GF A I'm afraid if past dealings with easyJet are anything to go by you're unlikely to get any joy here. In these situations, companies tend to take the NMP approach - not my problem. Because easyJet had no record of your booking it could argue you are making the whole story up, though I'm not suggesting for a minute you are. The fact your credit card provider was asked for payment, however, should indicate the truth of the matter - who was it asked to make payment to if not Easyjet? Nevertheless, as easyJet never had your cash or your booking, it is not obliged to do anything to ease the financial hardship you suffered as a result. Some might argue it is morally obliged to do something, but I wouldn't advise you to waste any more time pursuing this."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
