By inflicting only Sheffield United's second home defeat of the season, Alan Pardew's side leap-frogged their hosts into third place, capping their display when Nathan Tyson ran the length of the pitch and crossed for Nicky Forster to complete the win. Leicester may remain a distant 10 points away, but this remains startling progress indeed. Even after a trio of impressive recent victories, the visitors might have conceded their chances of extending that sequence were somewhat slim. The Royals had never previously won here, and had not even mustered a goal in their five previous meetings, with last night's early setback hardly suggesting a change of fortune. Adrian Williams' clumsy hack at Dean Windass three minutes in earned United the free-kick which Michael Brown curled deliciously into the top corner from 22 yards. The Blades will do well to keep the midfielder, currently considering a new deal, who followed up his 12th goal of a blistering campaign by crossing for Stuart McCall to volley crisply, forcing Marcus Hahnemann to tip aside. Yet the home side's whirlwind start was soon stifled, as Brown's influence waned. Nicky Shorey's in-swinging free-kick, well turned aside by Paddy Kenny as Steve Sidwell ran across his line of sight, might have brought parity. Nicky Forster's close-range finish 10 minutes before the interval after Andy Hughes's shot had struck Robert Page duly did. That was no way for Neil Warnock to celebrate signing a two-year extension to his contract, with Brown's shot, skied wastefully over the bar, doing little to improve the mood on the home bench. The substitute Nathan Tyson almost floored them with his first touch, as Kenny turned away his angled drive. But United did not survive for long, Hughes's shot from the edge of the area forcing Kenny to save only for Williams to slam the rebound into the roof of the net."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
