He was talking about Michael Owen's club form, but the sentiment applies just as well to this match. On the face of it, with nine goals in two games and nine points out of nine, Capello is in charge of an upward swing. Goals are not the whole story, however, and this was not the same England who functioned so smoothly in Croatia. It's amazing what a new coach and a 4-1 win over feared opponents can do to promote the feelgood factor. England fans arrived at Wembley actually looking forward to finding out how well Steven Gerrard could dovetail with Frank Lampard - which, considering they have spent the past four years being bored rigid by the debate, represented a marketing triumph on a par with getting Kazakhstan to laugh along with Sacha Baron Cohen. Gerrard was absent having minor surgery when Theo Walcott was running riot in Zagreb, so having lost no time in bringing him straight back, the next question was where Capello would station him. Bearing in mind that Gerrard reckons he has played only five times in his proper position for England, and not forgetting that Harry Redknapp might be watching. Capello was berated last time out at Wembley for 'killing' Gerrard by playing him wide left, an accusation the Italian hotly denied, pointing out that Gerrard was one of the front three in a Christmas-tree formation. This time he was played on the right of the middle three of a 4-3-3 formation, as close to his favoured position as makes no difference, with Gareth Barry as the holding player in the middle and Lampard operating on the left in a role he has often filled for Chelsea. This gave everyone as much freedom as they needed, although it might have been Kazakhstan doing that. In the build-up to Walcott's shot on goal after 16 minutes, Gerrard appeared first on the left, then on the right and then in the centre. Then Gerrard and Lampard swapped sides for a while, possibly to confuse the opposition, but only confusing themselves when they met in the middle and gave the ball away. England's neatest move of the first half-hour came when Emile Heskey teed up Lampard from Barry's searching ball forward, only for a first-time shot to strike a defender. Gerrard might have done better than settle for a corner when a long pass down the right from Wes Brown saw him break into the box, though as seconds earlier he had been on the opposite wing in his own half launching a perfectly weighted 50-yard diagonal pass for Walcott, it was hard to complain. Walcott attempted to return the favour when Wayne Rooney broke away to set up England's next attack, but from a promising position the winger either overestimated Gerrard's pace or badly overhit his pass. It was clear the two star midfielders had licence to play wherever they wanted, which is the kind of risk you can take against limited opposition such as Kazakhstan. The only problem, apart from the lack of end product that saw half-time arrive without any sign of the early goal or even the excitement Capello had promised, was that even Kazakhstan were finding ways through the England midfield and causing David James and his defenders moments of anxiety. The visitors did not just stay in their own half in the manner of Andorra, they attacked and managed to make inroads, with the influential Tanat Nusserbayev doing enough to earn a kick on the shin from Gerrard. The crowd mostly resisted the temptation to boo England off at the interval, though many a half-time conversation would have centred on the disappointing realisation that little appeared to have changed. England had not been supercharged with fresh confidence after all, and Capello seemed to be hitting the same brick wall as his predecessors over the Gerrard-Lampard conundrum. Neither was playing particularly badly, yet with both in the side there was little of the power and purpose displayed in Zagreb, and Walcott, Rooney and Heskey were nothing like as impressive. And if Kazakhstan could compete with England's midfield, how secure could it possibly be against top-level teams with the ability to pass their way through it? When Owen Hargreaves returns to international duty, one feels Capello still may have a decision to make about Gerrard and Lampard. He possibly considered making it at half-time, but opted instead to replace Barry with Shaun Wright-Phillips, switch to 4-4-2 with the substitute on the left wing, and ask Gerrard to stay back. This worked to the extent that England won the match with two goals in the first 20 minutes of the second half, though both were from set pieces, one was a fairly basic goalkeeping error and the other was an own goal. And Kazakhstan answered back almost immediately, with a goal that no one could say was unforeseen or undeserved. It did not work to the extent that Gerrard and Lampard could soon be seen tripping over themselves in central midfield in the manner we have seen many times before, and that neither of them looked particularly comfortable playing the narrow waist of a formation that often resembled 4-2-4. Even playing in that way, it was Wes Brown who provided the cross for Rooney to score the first of his two goals, the only one from open play. Between that and David Beckham's cameo appearance, the crowd had more occasion to cheer than to boo at the end, but the atmosphere was subdued again, excitement far from fever pitch. This 5-1 victory put the feelgood factor back to normal, ie nothing special. And Gerrard has still played only five-and-a-half games in his best position."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
