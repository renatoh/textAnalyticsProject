The Australian prime minister said Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan had displayed genuine remorse and he hoped the Indonesian government took account of their rehabilitation. Sukumaran\u2019s plea for clemency was rejected last month but the Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, is yet to make a final decision on Chan\u2019s request. Jakarta has taken a hardline stance against drug offenders and indicated that if Chan\u2019s appeal was rejected the two men would be executed together. In an interview on Tuesday, Abbott said he and the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, had made \u201cstrong representations\u201d on behalf of Sukumaran and Chan, and still hoped the Indonesian government would change its mind. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe in the death penalty, we don\u2019t believe in the death penalty here, we don\u2019t believe in the death penalty abroad, if any Australians are subject to it we do what we can to avert that,\u201d the prime minister told the Sydney radio station WSFM. \u201cBut in the end Indonesia, while it is a good and close friend of Australia, it is a sovereign country, they do have their own judicial system. \u201cI hope that the evidence of genuine remorse, of genuine rehabilitation means that, even at this late stage, the plea for clemency might be accepted because in the end mercy has to be a part of every justice system including the Indonesian one.\u201d Dutch and Brazilian citizens were among six people killed by firing squad in Indonesia on Sunday. Asked whether Australia would follow the Dutch and Brazilian governments in recalling ambassadors if the executions went ahead, Abbott said: \u201cMy job is to try to stop the executions going ahead and I don\u2019t want to pre-empt what may or may not happen afterwards. As I said, I think these two are well and truly reformed characters and I hope that the Indonesians will accept that and acknowledge and act appropriately.\u201d At a later media conference in Sydney, Abbott said he had personally raised the issue with the Indonesian president but he was \u201cnot going to go into the detail of who said what to whom and when\u201d. Labor has supported the efforts to seek clemency. Sukumaran and Chan, members of the so-called Bali Nine group, were sentenced to death over a 2005 plot to smuggle heroin from Indonesia to Australia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
