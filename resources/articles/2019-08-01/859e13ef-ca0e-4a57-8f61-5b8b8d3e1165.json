While once we used it to watch funny videos or find a recipe, it\u2019s now a necessity for managing our everyday lives. We go online to do banking, pay bills, lodge tax returns, process Medicare rebates and apply for jobs. But we don\u2019t all have equal access. Australia ranks only 22nd in the world in internet availability. And in most cases, our already-vulnerable groups are least likely to benefit from \u201cdigital inclusion\u201d. The Australian Digital Inclusion Index (ADII) uses this term to describe the idea that \u201ceveryone should be able to make full use of digital technologies\u201d. That doesn\u2019t simply mean having an internet connection; it also means having the knowledge to access and use digital services to manage health and wellbeing, connect with family, benefit from education, and so on. In Australia, age is the biggest factor in digital inclusion. People over 65 are less likely to have access to the internet, usually have less-developed internet skills and feel more negativity towards it. This gap between older and younger Australians has widened since 2014, according to the ADII. Some groups tend to have internet access but are disadvantaged in other ways. Indigenous Australians - who are well below the national average for digital inclusion - are more likely to use mobile devices, which have a higher data cost. There\u2019s plenty of overlap, too. A study of homeless people found that while 77% of respondents had mobile devices with internet access, most struggled to make their phone payments. They were also more likely to be living with disability or not have post-secondary education, both of which are factors in digital exclusion. Breaking down these barriers is possible. Research from QUT and Australia Post shows that low digital literacy is a common obstacle to connecting online. But for the 1 in 10 Australians who don\u2019t use the internet at all, the biggest reason is simply a lack of interest. They don\u2019t know why they should care about the internet, or what they would use it for. To drive education and participation, Australia Post created a digital mentoring initiative that launched in 2018. Head of strategic partnerships and programs, community &amp; consumer, Catherine McKean, says digital inclusion is crucial. \u201cIt\u2019s really important in terms of being connected, getting access to health services, education and so on,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a critical component. For us, the work has really been around building that capability.\u201d McKean says involving local communities to deliver the program has been a great success. \u201cWe did some blended learning, face-to-face, where we partnered with community organisations to mentor people through the program. Mentoring creates this community of capability and community of support. \u201cWe looked at how you could shift more people up the line in terms of understanding their ability to use digital capabilities more, and then be able to understand how they could access government services, educational services, or other benefits people can have through digital technology.\u201d Australia Post sees digital inclusion as vital in meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically SDG 4, which focuses on better access to education, SDG 8 to promote higher economic growth, SDG 10 to reduce inequalities and SDG 11 to create more sustainable communities. And it has an enormous overflow effect. Some of the connections are obvious: elderly people are able to speak to far-flung family members; people with disability can use technology to assist with accessibility; and remote communities can have their voices heard in major cities. Others are more intertwined, connecting people to industry and economic opportunities so their whole community can prosper. A UK study found that digitally included individuals are likely to perform better academically, and that digital inclusion has a positive impact on overall GDP. QUT suggests there is an inextricable link between digital and social inclusion. Another Australian study showed low-income families were better able to connect with society, had increased social opportunities, and felt less socially isolated. While there\u2019s still a long way to go before every Australian is included, there has been a definitive upward swing. More people are connected than ever before, and they generally have positive attitudes towards finding information and socialising. With programs to educate and encourage, we can close the gaps of access and ability, and help the internet do what it does best: bring people together. Australia Post has set their sights on 2030 with a new corporate responsibility plan that charts commitments and aspirations to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals"}, "isHosted": false}}}
