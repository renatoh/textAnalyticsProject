But what of the partridge itself? When I was growing up on the edge of London, the grey partridge was, if not exactly common, a fairly regular sight. If I took a trip to East Anglia, they were ten a penny. Nowadays, I struggle to find them anywhere. That\u2019s because this classic farmland bird has declined by over 90% in the past 50 years: down from half a million pairs to fewer than 50,000. As with another species we sing about in the carol \u2013 the turtle dove \u2013 it\u2019s the usual story. Our demand for cheap food, leading to more intensive farming, simply doesn\u2019t allow room for this charismatic gamebird. The image of the largely terrestrial partridge perched in a pear tree has always struck me as odd; and it seems that I was right. The \u2018pear tree\u2019 is actually a corruption of the French word for the species \u2013 perdrix, pronounced with a silent x, as pair-dree.
