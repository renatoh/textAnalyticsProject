Workers represented by the union Bectu have announced plans to disrupt the British Film Institute\u2019s London film festival between 4 and 15 October, with nine days of strike action over the period in a dispute over the living wage and other rights, including sick pay. However, as the dispute enters a second year, the cinema chain has rejected the claim that the strike action is valid. \u201cAny employee taking part in those strikes is likely to be dismissed,\u201d lawyers representing Picturehouse said in a letter sent to Bectu and seen by the Guardian. The union said workers would strike at five London cinemas \u2013 the Ritzy in Brixton, Hackney Picturehouse, Crouch End Picturehouse, East Dulwich Picturehouse, and Picturehouse Central. Obi Saiq, one of the striking workers at Hackney Picturehouse, said: \u201cWe are striking for a wage that we can live on and for basic rights at work \u2013 and until Picturehouse negotiates with us, which they haven\u2019t done in over a year of strike action, we have no choice but to fight. Our strike action will go ahead, and we expect to significantly disrupt the London film festival.\u201d Bectu claims that Picturehouse and its owner, Cineworld, refuse to negotiate on demands for the London living wage, company sick pay for all, maternity, paternity and adoption pay, and the reinstatement of four sacked union reps at the Ritzy. \u201cPicturehouse management know they have no legal grounds to stop the proposed strike action during the London film festival and have now resorted to threatening their own staff,\u201d said Gerry Morrissey, general secretary of Bectu. \u201cWe will not be bullied and we will robustly defend any legal action. If the Picturehouse management are confident that they are paying the living wage why have they not signed up as a living wage employer? We challenge them to do so.\u201d The London living wage is calculated by an independent body, the Living Wage Foundation, and is \u00a39.75 an hour. A spokesperson for Cineworld said: \u201cThis is an issue for Picturehouse and its management team and we hope that the dispute is resolved as quickly as possible.\u201d Picturehouse did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment on Sunday, but in a statement on 20 September on its website, it said: \u201cFront-of-house staff at London Picturehouses are paid \u00a39.30 per hour, equivalent to \u00a39.92 per hour when working an eight-hour shift as we choose to pay for breaks. \u201cStaff at The Ritzy Picturehouse London are represented by Bectu and agreed a rate of \u00a39.10 per hour \u2013 equivalent to \u00a39.70 with a paid break \u2013 from 2 September 2016.\u201d The British Film Institute has previously said it supported the Picturehouse workers\u2019 call for payment of the London living wage, which it paid its own employees."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
