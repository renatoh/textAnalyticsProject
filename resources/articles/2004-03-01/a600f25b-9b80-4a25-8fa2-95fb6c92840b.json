She had to consider environmental worries that the construction lobby would read whatever she wrote as carte blanche to concrete over Britain ... Finally, she had to deal with considerable uncertainty about economic demographics. The report balances these demands sensibly ... [It] brings originality and objectivity to a sector bogged down in a sterile conflict between interest groups. Ms Barker ... has laid a useful cornerstone for the future.\" Boris Johnson Daily Telegraph, March 18 \"Ms Barker ... says if we built an extra 120,000 private dwellings a year, then British house price inflation would converge with the European average of 1.1% ... It seems she wants to reduce house prices ... because, in the words of the Treasury, 'the housing market is a high-risk factor to the achievement of settled and sustainable convergence with the rest of Europe.' \"In other words ... get rid of that buoyant housing market and we might join the euro. It seems a bit of a shame, to put it mildly, that, in order to make ourselves fit for the euro, Ms Barker and the Treasury think we should concrete over large chunks of south-east England.\" Simon Jenkins Evening Standard, London, March 18 \"The Barker report is in fact a Trojan horse for something more nakedly political. Mr Brown, his colleague John Prescott and [London's mayor] Ken Livingstone all have different reasons for appeasing the property lobby and pushing through hyperdevelopment against the wishes of local communities. They want an end to local planning. Instead they want target-setting by regional offices of Whitehall. \"This blitzkreig across south-east England has been pressed forward by the construction lobby ... Outside national parks and beauty spots, nowhere in rural England can be considered safe. The dictatorial planning of the second world war has returned.\" Deborah Orr Independent, March 18 \"Apart from those unfortunates who haven't got on to that wonderfully desirable ladder, very few people actually want the situation to change that much ... Those who managed to achieve their expensive property ... recently ... dread the prospect of their property ending up being worth less than they paid for it. It is hard to see how a massive house-building programme could be undertaken without creating quite a number of such casualties. \"Is this what Mr Brown is considering? How to provide 'affordable homes' without devaluing other modest but inflated property? I fear that he might be, and that his quest is an impossible one. Many new homes must be built, and the government that builds them will find themselves loved for their trouble only by a needy minority. No amount of time-wasting can change this basic fact.\" Alan Beattie Financial Times, March 18 \"The review ... correctly asserts that a substantial and sustained increase in housebuilding is desirable to make homes more affordable and increase worker mobility. But the new tax it proposes on rising land values would have the perverse effect of discouraging supply ... It acts directly and negatively on the critical decision by landowners to bring undeveloped land to the housebuilding market ... \"It is distinctly odd that a fundamental tax change proposed by the review is aimed at securing the public finances their share from a putative boom in housebuilding, rather than at trying to ensure that such a boom takes place.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
