In fact they\u2019re not Americans: I check by cunningly asking them. Just resting German actors, playing the part of military police from the country that once invaded them, then stayed for 44 years to fight another war. She\u2019s playing a Beethoven sonata. Opus 27 number 2, in fact, better known as the Moonlight, and playing it on a lovely boxy dark old Bechstein grand inside the pleasantly shambolic art gallery she runs, and playing it rather well. Her name is Claudia Croon and she is a delight, but our conversation takes an oddly metaphysical turn. \u201cI only stopped hearing the sound of jackboots about a year ago,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is almost a musical sound \u2013 very much 4/4 time, a military sound. Jackboots. I now make myself play 3/4 time more often, the sound of the waltz, and I feel this city, my Berlin, my beloved Berlin, has finally, once and for all, changed into a new time. No more jackboots.\u201d Time and again I hear similar sentiments. The cold war was brutish indeed, rupturing the city and many of its families, but it is long gone now: Berlin, if it does still struggle with memories today, struggles still to erase the Nazis. East Berlin, which always held the bulk of the beauty \u2013 the high vaulting insanity of the churches and galleries and gargoyles and statues which adorn the banks of the Spree \u2013 is utterly transformed. New bars open weekly. The German Democratic Republic and its memories are, if anything, gently mocked. Not even that gently sometimes: there are, in the centre of the city, giggling stalls inviting one to \u201ccelebrate\u201d the Trabbie [Trabant], and take lurching tours in its Toytown tin design. There is the DDR [GDR] Restaurant, a wall of which features Ronald Paris\u2019s 1969 fresco In Praise of Communism, in which one can enjoy retro-delights such as Vita-Cola, introduced in 1958 and the first cola drink in the GDR. \u201cIts unique lemon flavour was the creation of Miltitz Chemical Works \u2026\u201d or Ketwurst, \u201cdevised by the Gastronomic Rationalisation and Research Centre in 1978\u201d. Doesn\u2019t stop them making a mild non-ironic killing on the prices. But these are mainly tourist joints: elsewhere the Ost years are remembered by Berliners with more complexity, almost a strange retro fondness. In most new bars flurrying along the northern Danzigerstrasse, for instance, the decor is pure east Germany circa 1968 \u2013 little squat comfortable hard-cushioned chairs, wooden mantelpiece clocks, weak but warm yellow lighting. Berlin doesn\u2019t need reminding, danke sch\u00f6n, of the price it paid for being the centre of the cold war. Next Sunday it will rightly celebrate the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Wall. Eight thousand lighted balloons will mark the line of the old Wall, to be released that evening. Hillary Clinton and John Kerry will be among those attending. And there will be quiet time to remember the victims. Not just those who fell in no man\u2019s land, or in desperately ingenious attempts to escape by zip-wire, tunnel, even submarine, but the families and friends and colleagues rent and bereft for 28 long years. The Berlin Wall went up on 13 August 1961 and came down, almost by accident, after a flurry of missed communications, garbled orders and fearful guards one happy night in November 1989. Peter Unsicker, whom I run into back in the centre of town, remembers it well: climbed the Wall, sat on it. \u201cWe could hear them crying out, chanting \u2013 Let us go, let us out! We West Berliners started to shout back: we could soon all hear each other. We cried: Let them out! There were many tears, many hugs, that night.\u201d Did he think any Berliners felt nostalgia for the Wall? \u201cYou see that Dixi [portable workman\u2019s toilet] outside the shop? I\u2019ve been asking recently every Berliner I meet: would you rather have that in the street, or the Wall? 100% say they\u2019d rather have the shitter.\u201d Peter has marked the line of the former Wall with sweet plastic flowers, which he symbolically waters every day. \u201cBut some older people may have conflicting emotions. They sometimes miss the security [of the DDR]. The low rents. And the modern \u2026 tyranny of choice! But no one wants the Wall back.\u2019 In truth, the seeds of its destruction were sown way earlier than the 1980s. In the late 1950s, the Soviet ambassador in east Germany, Mikhail Pervukhin, observed with dry prescience that \u201cthe presence in Berlin of an uncontrolled border between the socialist and capitalist worlds unwittingly prompts the population to make a comparison between both parts of the city, which, unfortunately, does not always turn out in favour of the Democratic [east] Berlin\u201d. Nevertheless, the Russians are getting ready for the anniversary too. Both the Russian Federation and US embassies squat together in the shadow of the Brandenburg Gate, but only the former is showing any signs of activity \u2013 a flurry of sandblasting, and a new gilting to the heavy black doors: a brave attempt to chase a pig which has long since bolted and urgently apply lipstick. I am deeply aware, as I stand in the gathering gloom of the Sophien cemetery on Bernauerstrasse, of the sacrifices and misery of the cold war years. Here, along a busy northern ring road, the Wall has been turned into art: a mile, almost, of rather beautiful serried and rusted symbolic iron poles, representing the reinforcements to the concrete of the Wall. They are spaced with considerably more kindness to allow comings and goings. But, despite what some few might have wished, the ideas holding the Wall together are long fled. I was made more acutely aware of history when earlier I stood beside the Topography of Terror museum in Zimmerstrasse. Here you can gaze, at a point, at both the ruined cellars of the old sprawling Albrechtstrasse Gestapo headquarters, the ones in which prisoners died while Himmler paced parqueted floors high above, and, seven feet away, an equally ugly little remnant of the Wall, its rusted reinforcements peeking through. There can be few feet on earth which better signify the 20th century. Fascism, communism: both at heart simple stories of totalitarianism. In the Monterey Bar high on Danziger that night, they are in no doubt as to which is more likely to return. Adie Sampson, originally from Melbourne, but now a full Berliner, with two modern (which is to say retro, thus bustling with ex-GDR accoutrements) bars, is deeply wary of next Sunday\u2019s commemoration for the violence it may bring. \u201cThe neo-Nazis have a new cause. Isis. They gather these days to hate Muslims. Muslim are the new Jews. There were nasty clashes last week in Cologne \u2013 and I suspect they\u2019ll use next week for another show. \u201cThere are thousands. Mainly footie fans and those who feel hard done by, and slightly thick country folk. And the anti-fascists will be there in force too, and there will be clashes. Every Berliner I know has a good word to say for the anti-fascists. Which is a nice change. But I do worry.\u201d Could Claudia\u2019s echoed jackboots be returning? I doubt it. This is a city transformed totally, a city very much in 3/4 time. A young city, a lovely city, a staggeringly diverse and artistic city, a future city \u2013 although I don\u2019t think it will ever easily forget the 20th century. It might even take the lead in the current one. On Kollwitzstrasse late on the Friday night, I pass two blackboards outside bars which state, gleefully, \u201cNo WLAN [Wi-fi]. Please just talk to each other and get drunk.\u201d Now that\u2019s what I call a decent ancient city, at last grown up, and finally setting the tone for good rather than evil."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
