The Trump administration issued a new rule on 9 November that effectively banned migrants from claiming asylum if they crossed the US border outside of a designated port of entry. The rule, issued by presidential decree, penalises thousands of migrants, many of whom are mothers and children fleeing violence in Central America, who cross the border illegally. Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) argued before Judge Jon Tigar on Monday that the administration\u2019s new rule violates the Immigration and Nationality Act, which states that any person present in the US can claim asylum irrespective of how they entered the country. The applicants are requesting the judge issue a temporary restraining order on the rule. \u201cThe administration is trying to override what Congress has done,\u201d argued Lee Gelerent, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s immigration rights project. He added: \u201cEntering between a port of entry has no bearing on what danger you may be in.\u201d Gelerent argued the new rules would lead to a \u201creal humanitarian crisis\u201d and said that unaccompanied minors currently waiting to enter the US at ports of entry were already being turned away by authorities. \u201cThat\u2019s why we believe there\u2019s a critical need,\u201d Gelerent said. \u201cThose kids are in critical danger.\u201d Trump issued the proclamation shortly after the midterm elections during which the president ratched up anti-immigrant rhetoric on the campaign trail and invoked conspiracy theories about a migrant caravan thousands of miles from the US. The radical restrictions are part of the administration\u2019s ongoing efforts to curtail immigration into the US, which led to the family separation crisis earlier in the year and the administration\u2019s policy of banning migrants from several Muslim-majority countries. But the policy is perhaps the most legally precarious given the wording of the Immigration and National Security Act. During a number of exchanges between Judge Tigar and the justice department attorney Scott Stewart, the administration was asked to explain how the new rules did not override current legislation. In a hypothetical question, Judge Tigar asked: \u201cLet\u2019s say we said you can come to the hearing at the federal court in any vehicle. But then we have a rule if you came here on a bicycle, you\u2019re not getting in? \u201cHow does that not render the expression of congressional intent null?\u201d Stewart argued that the government was under no \u201cmandatory burden\u201d to allow asylum to any one individual and suggested the new policy would still allow people to make claims if they crossed into the US legally. But pressed for assurances that meritorious cases would not slip through the net, Stewart would not be drawn. \u201cDoes the government contend \u2026 that no claims for relief that were granted in the past, will now be denied?\u201d Judge Tigar asked. \u201cI can\u2019t predict what will happen,\u201d Stewart responded. The court adjourned on Monday morning after less than two hours of arguments. A ruling is expected soon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
