Guthrie is under pressure from staff and lobby groups as news leaks out about what television and radio shows are for the chopping block, a period of time referred to internally as \u201cthe killing season\u201d. The national director of the Uniting Church, the Reverend Elenie Poulos, the Baptist minister Tim Costello and the Catholic priest Father Frank Brennan were among the faith leaders who talked to Guthrie and the ABC\u2019s director of radio, Michael Mason, about their concerns. Guardian Australian understands the decision to end Sunday Nights with John Cleary, a 15-year-old religion and ethics program broadcast nationally on local radio, has already been made. Changes to ABC radio \u2013 which are likely to also include cuts to Radio National\u2019s music programming \u2013 are to be announced next week. The meeting coincides with the arrival this week of Judith Whelan, a former editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, to take up her new role as the head of spoken content at ABC Radio. Whelan a print journalist who has no experience in radio, will oversee the capital city radio network, Radio National and the sports network Grandstand. The axing of Sunday Night comes a week after another specialist program area \u2013 science \u2013 was gutted and 17 positions were made redundant after the cancellation of the weekly magazine-style Catalyst program. Poulos said the faith leaders had asked for the meeting with Guthrie because they were concerned about possible cuts to local radio and also about the possible decline in the quality of religious coverage, which they feared would deteriorate into \u201creligious-light\u201d programming. \u201cWe had a meeting in May last year with Mark Scott and the chairman, Jim Spigelman, and we got assurances of their commitment to religion,\u201d Poulos said after the meeting. \u201cBut we are seeing it play out in a different way. Poulos said the group had been told there would be \u201cno net cuts overall\u201d. \u201cNow more than ever we need a well-informed and well-supported conversation about religion and society and we need spaces where those conversations are well informed and the analysis is deep,\u201d Poulos said. \u201cThere is no other dedicated religious coverage and we really rely on the ABC for that.\u201d Sunday Nights has been broadcast nationally since 2001 and provides a forum to discuss topical issues to do with religion, ethics, spirituality, values and social issues. It is understood that Cleary, a veteran ABC broadcaster, has been offered another position at Radio National. The half-hour Religious and Ethics program on the station is expected to return in 2017. The religious TV program Compass \u2013 now the ABC\u2019s only in-house production \u2013 is also expected to survive next year. Two years ago a $254m cut by the Coalition government to the ABC budget led to job losses in the religion and ethics department. At the time Cleary warned the religious programs were vulnerable because the bulk of the unit\u2019s resources were gone. Sources say Radio National is facing even bigger changes next year as it moves towards a digital-first strategy and away from a linear broadcasting model. More content is now being made with an online audience in mind. \u201cIn 2017, RN will embody digital content creation from the beginning, through to the end, with all our content,\u201d a confidential briefing document says. \u201cThis will coexist with a high regard for our linear audience. An increased investment in digital will help us reach younger and more diverse Australian audiences. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll do this by concentrating on the kind of distinctive content that, in the ecosystem of the ABC, RN can provide. We will be an \u2018ideas network\u2019 that produces world-class specialist and topical content that\u2019s engaging and accessible, and ensure our genre experts appear across a wide range of platforms and channels.\u201d On Thursday an ABC spokeswoman said the broadcaster welcomed in the input from faith leaders: \u201cYesterday\u2019s meeting was a frank and confidential discussion with religious leaders from a variety of faiths about ABC strategies and challenges. \u201cThe ABC welcomed the dialogue and looks forward to extending it into next year and beyond. There are some changes planned.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
