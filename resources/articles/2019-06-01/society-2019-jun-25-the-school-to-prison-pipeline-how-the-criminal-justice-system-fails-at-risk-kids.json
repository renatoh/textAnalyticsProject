He isn\u2019t sure of the reason. A few years back, when he was serving a stint in juvenile detention, he was sent his official Family and Community Services (Facs) record but he hasn\u2019t read it. \u201cWhatever\u2019s in there, they\u2019re still our parents.\u201d He is resolute, defiant. If he has some small way to control the story of his childhood, this is it. The rest of it has been out of his hands. As a solicitor in the children\u2019s court over a decade ago, I remember kids like Jordan \u2013 uprooted from the places they grew up in and upended in the juvenile justice system. Frustrated magistrates asked a standard set of questions: what are the alternatives to custody? Is stable accommodation available? A place at school? Rarely were there satisfactory answers. It was meant to be different from the adult courts \u2013 more therapeutic, a stronger focus on rehabilitation. And sure, there was less of an adversarial charge in the air. But it was no less of a hamster wheel. What I quickly learned is that the courtroom \u2013 the justice system \u2013 is a point in time reflecting back on all the failures leading up to it. Lawyers make submissions, the court makes a determination. And here we go again. When you look across the course of someone\u2019s life for the levers into the criminal justice system, you have to start early. A third of children living in our most disadvantaged areas are developmentally vulnerable in at least one key domain. That goes up to a half of Aboriginal children and children living in very remote areas. A critical shortage of allied health services means that most of these issues go undiagnosed and untreated. Learning difficulties lead to disengagement. \u201cBad\u201d behaviour repeats and escalates. And before you know it, a kid is suspended. Nothing is more perplexing than the practice of school suspension. Just when children are in greatest need, they get cut loose from school with a homework booklet. These aren\u2019t likely to be kids who have parents who can drop everything to be at home with them. When a support system should go into overdrive, instead it shuts down. It is no surprise who this hits the hardest: kids with cognitive impairments, kids in child protection and Aboriginal kids. And no surprise that the result is so often a lever into the criminal justice system. The school-to-prison pipeline. The crossover from out-of-home care into the criminal justice system. There have been enough reports and inquiries to make your head spin. What they tell us is that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are almost 10 times more likely to end up in out-of-home care. What they tell us is that children in the child protection system commonly end up before the courts on trivial matters that could ordinarily be dealt with by a parent. What they tell us is that the vast majority of young people in prison have experienced trauma that leads to substance abuse and mental health issues but only a small minority receive adequate treatment and support. What they tell us, ultimately, is that the resources are in all the wrong places. Jordan\u2019s story is an example \u2013 and a stark reminder. Placed in a violent household far away from his home town, he stole a car and drove back to be close to his brothers. By 15, he was using ice every day and had overdosed three times. After a seven-day binge, he was part of a robbery gone wrong \u2013 horribly and violently wrong \u2013 that landed him in juvenile detention for three years. When he talks about his \u201ccrazy mates\u201d you realise it was par for the course. \u201cThere were 15 of us. Ten are locked up, four are dead. Then there\u2019s me.\u201d Remarkably, Jordan\u2019s story also gives us an instance of how our systems can sometimes get it right. A specialist court for Aboriginal children linked him with a strong set of support people and, critically, an Aboriginal youth worker \u201cwho always had my back\u201d. Jordan talks about a bond, a friendship. When he was released, he could trust that for the first time in his life there were people who weren\u2019t going to give up on him. Now 22, he and his partner have just had their first child, a boy. It begs the question: what if we got it right earlier? Indigenous courts, restorative alternatives to suspension, community-led justice reinvestment initiatives that support children and families across the life course: there are plenty of examples right now around Australia of how we can get it right but a woefully inadequate approach to implementation. Governments need to stop building more prisons and get serious. A boy with a story like Jordan\u2019s shouldn\u2019t be considered one of the lucky ones. \u2022 Jordan\u2019s name has been changed. \u2022 Sarah Hopkins\u2019 novel The Subjects is inspired by her work as a criminal lawyer representing young people, and as the managing solicitor of Justice Projects at the Aboriginal Legal Service NSW/ACT and chair of Just Reinvest NSW."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
