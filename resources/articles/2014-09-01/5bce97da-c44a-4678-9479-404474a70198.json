But for the German supermarket\u2019s suffering rivals, it is another turn of the screw. A steely focus on price and simplicity, against a backdrop of falling living standards that has sharpened customers\u2019 eye for a bargain, has seen the discounter grab market share from competitors and transform what we expect from our weekly shop. If you could judge the scale of a company\u2019s ambition by the size of its boardroom table then Aldi has a huge appetite. Sitting at a blonde wood circle the size of a spaceship, the fast growing German discounter\u2019s two managing directors explain how they are eating the major supermarkets\u2019 lunch. Aldi has spurred the likes of Tesco, Morrison\u2019s, Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s into cutting prices this year but is determined to keep the big four at arm\u2019s length. \u201cWhatever our competitors plan to do we know exactly what our response will be and our competitors do as well. We will not let them compete on price. We will not let them close the gap,\u201d says Matthew Barnes, a smooth-talking Brit who has risen through Aldi\u2019s ranks to lead the UK business alongside German-born colleague Roman Heini. \u201cThat\u2019s our DNA, that\u2019s our patch, that\u2019s what we stand for and that\u2019s what our customers expect and we are in the habit of giving our customers what they want. We want to have a minimum of a 15% basket discount [to the UK\u2019s major chains] and the reality is that it\u2019s higher than that.\u201d Such drive has turned Aldi into a serious player in the cut-throat world of British retail, gobbling up market share to leave it a breath away from surpassing Waitrose as the UK\u2019s sixth largest grocer. Sales at the store, where 95% of products are own-label, rose nearly 36% last year to \u00a35.3bn, and pre-tax profits soared 65% to \u00a3260.9m, according to figures released today. Buoyed by the success of its frugal business model, Aldi is not letting up on the pace of growth. It has less than 600 stores in the UK and is planning a \u00a3600m expansion spree, adding 54 stores this year and up to 65 next year with an aim for 1,000 outlets by 2021. Aldi\u2019s heartlands are in the north and Midlands. It has just 21 stores in London, as it has found it tough to afford suitable sites inside the M25. But Barnes and Heini are testing a way to crack the capital. Aldi\u2019s first small convenience store opened in Kilburn 18 months ago, and its second will open in Tooting Bec, south London, next autumn. \u201cIt\u2019s a very considered process which we are certainly not rushing but Kilburn has smashed all our targets and expectations,\u201d says Barnes. With shoppers now fully aware of the low prices at Aldi and its fellow German discounter Lidl, mighty Tesco, the giant British retailer, which came close to controlling a third of all grocery sales in the UK, is in disarray, while Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s are also suffering. All have been forced to cut prices in a bid to stop shoppers leaking away. Yet Aldi has only echoed those price drops to maintain its lead on price. \u201cWe have reduced our gross margins in the last year to ensure we compete and we will maintain that even if we have to reduce gross margins further to deliver,\u201d says Baines. Competing on price is difficult for the large supermarket groups, which can stock more than 40,000 different products in their largest stores, but are up against the limited range of goods in discounters like Aldi. By sourcing large amounts of only 2,500 products, Aldi is able to keep costs low and pass on the benefit to shoppers. Efficiency, simplicity and cost saving run right through the business. Because more than 90% of its goods are own-label, packaging can be designed to fit the maximum amount onto shelves and pallets so no space in a store or lorry is wasted. While rivals might leave air at the top of a box of cereal to make you feel you are getting more for your money, Aldi keeps \u201cullage\u201d, as it\u2019s known in the business, to a minimum because it is focused on efficiency. All that helps deliver prices that are tempting a growing number of shoppers to buy their full weekly grocery shop at Aldi\u2019s stores. Price may be an important factor in Aldi\u2019s recent success, but it is not the whole story. The grocer, which takes its name from the first letters of the Albrecht family that own it, and the last two from \u201cdiscount\u201d, has been in the UK for nearly 25 years and for much of that time had little impact. Four years ago there was a change of plan. Heini, who had set up Aldi\u2019s Swiss business, and Barnes, who worked his way up through Aldi\u2019s ranks via a spell in Australia, took charge in the UK. They widened the range of products to include more fresh fruit, vegetables and meat and worked more closely with British suppliers. In the past 10 years, the range of fresh fruit and vegetables has gone from just 10 items to 100. A focus on British sourcing has seen sales of fresh meat rise 60% a year in the last three years despite Aldi being one of the big names involved in the horse meat scandal in 2013, with two of its readymeals found to have been severely tainted. All the beef and chicken in Aldi\u2019s British ready meals now comes from the UK. Another fast-growing area is its Specially Selected range of premium foods, from brioche buns to speciality coffees, which increased sales by 90% last year. Overall, Aldi has increased its range of products from about 900 to more than 2,500 regular lines topped up by at least 200 more seasonal products as it tries to broaden its appeal. \u201cOur transformation from a top-up to a full shopping destination is well underway. It has taken nearly four years. We are increasing the number of items in shoppers\u2019 baskets every month but there has been great traction in the last 12 to 18 months driven by range and quality improvements,\u201d says Heini. He says shoppers\u2019 tastes have also swung Aldi\u2019s way, with more cynicism about the major grocer\u2019s promotions and discounts compared to Aldi\u2019s tactic of offering low prices on a permanent basis. The economic downturn has helped Aldi and its fellow discounter, Lidl. With shoppers short of spare cash, they have been more willing to seek out alternatives where they can save money. Both have managed to attract an increasing number of middle-class shoppers with deals on treats like champagne and fine wines. More than half, 51%, of Aldi\u2019s shoppers are now in the wealthiest ABC1 demographic. Now the economy is improving, Aldi wants to hold on to those big spenders. This Christmas it will increase its premium Specially Selected range by nearly a third compared to last year. It is also installing 5km of extra chiller cabinets across the chain so that it can bring in more fresh fruit, pre-prepared salads and delicacies like fresh crab, fresh scallops and smoked salmon for Christmas and beyond. Instore bakeries are being trialled and Aldi is stocking an increasing number of ready meals \u2013 products which have traditionally been the heartland of supermarkets like Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco. There is a risk that all these extra services and products may complicate Aldi\u2019s offer. Its bargain-hunting shoppers may be put off. Barnes and Heini admit they will not be able to extend Aldi\u2019s range of goods much further and there is a limit to the size of stores it can operate. Recently, there have been signs of a slowdown in the pace of growth and it remains to be seen whether Aldi can hold shoppers\u2019 attention once they have more spare cash in their pockets. Whatever happens, Barnes believes Aldi has the answer: \u201cWe are completely dedicated to the discount model and keeping it simple,\u201d he says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
