Great thanks, Small Talk. You've just finished 10th in the Olympic Games: is that good or bad? [Very enthusiastically] To be honest, it's a dream come true. Coming into the competition, we felt a top 12 finish would be a really good result given the stage we're at in our development. So this sets us up nicely for the next four years. Have you, then, been walking around the British camp laughing at everyone who flopped? [Charmingly] No, no. If I see anyone looking down, I'll be straight over there trying to cheer them up. Obviously I'm not going to be too happy and bubbly because I don't want to piss them off, but I like to get into the mindset that we're all in Team GB and should all support each other no matter what. I'd appreciate that if someone did it for me. Did you learn anything from the couples who finished ahead of you? Definitely. There's so much you can learn from them. In most cases, what they have that we don't is experience. For example, take Margarita Drobiazko and Povilas Vanagas, the Lithuanian couple who finished seventh: they were at their fifth Olympics - we used to watch them as kids so it was amazing to wind up competing against them. The good thing is that most of the people who finished ahead of us won't be around in four years when, hopefully, we'll be much better. Do these old timers pass down any tips to youngsters like you and Sinead? Actually, what I've noticed is that the older guys tend to be very friendly and are always ready to chat and give us younger ones advice. But the girls tend to talk to us and each other a lot less. A bit catty are they? [Laughs] Let's be kind and say that \"competitive\" would be a better word. I think sometimes girls find it more difficult to separate competition from personalities. Do you subscribe to the theory that there'd be less wars in the world if all our presidents and prime ministers were women? [Chuckling] I'm not so sure about that. I think women might like power a bit too much and maybe some of them would be tempted to abuse it. Indeed, something men would never do. Now then, is dancing with your sister a trifle weird? [Chirpily as ever] A brother and sister team offer a different dynamic as a couple, like the Duchesnays did, not that we're trying to replicate them, since we're trying to create something original. I know some people think you can't do a romantic routine or present a routine that has, I suppose, a sexual context to it, such as a tango or a rumba. But at the end of the day, it's just an act. Look at Chris [Dean] and Jane [Torvill], they were superb actors: they could go out on the ice and present something very romantic even though there was nothing going on between them. It's just about presenting a certain style or mystique. So it's not an issue for us. What's this about you being Ally McCoist's body double? [Guffaws heartily] When we were struggling for cash, we used to do some work as TV extras. I ended up being a body double for Ally McCoist in his short-lived film career - I think the Robert Duvall movie A Shot at Glory lasted five minutes at the box office! Anyway, Kilmarnock wouldn't release Ally from training one day so I was called up. They cut my hair a certain way and put on a bit of baggage - he had become quite tubby by that stage in his career! If someone made a movie of your life, who should be your body double? Woody Allen! [Dissolves into laughter] No, I'm only kidding. Let's say Johnny Depp, he's nearly as good looking as me! And how about Sinead? [Sinead pipes up for the first time] Keira Knightley! [Explodes with laughter] [John chips in] It's the stomach muscles, see. Sinead has iron stomach muscles and Keira's look pretty good, too. Will you be tuning into the Scotland-England rugby match tomorrow? Definitely, I'll have to find a TV for that. I'm a real sports anorak. Who's your sporting idol? Well, I don't have that Scottish thing about thinking everyone has to beat England. I was really behind them in the World Cup against Australia and I'm a big fan of Jonny Wilkinson. I feel really bad for him at the moment because of all the injuries he's having. His obsession with his sport is very similar to what Sinead and I have; not that I'm putting us in the same category as him, I just mean I really understand why he wants to practice so much and totally devote himself to what he does. What's the last CD you bought? [Pauses uncharacteristically before eventually declaring] It was Franz Ferdinand. Can you ice dance to that? It's funny, that always the first thing I ask myself when I listen to music. And recently we've been talking about dancing to stuff with lyrics. Someone did something with Pink Floyd last year and it was brilliant. There's definitely scope to bring contemporary music into it. I've heard some Depeche Mode and White Stripes tracks that could work quite well. Not sure how it would go down with an Eastern European judging panel though! What's your favourite TV show? Dancing on Ice, of course! I was a massive Lost fan, too. But I do always try to catch Dancing on Ice because even though it's not to the level we're at, it's really interesting to see how people who've never done it before take to it. Who's your favourite TV detective? It has to be Poirot. His fussiness is fantastic. Miss Marple isn't bad but nowhere near as fun. Your favourite dish is ...? The meatballs my mum makes, with cheese on top and everything. What's the wackiest thing you've ever done whilst drunk? Oh Christ. I proposed to someone once! I don't remember who it was. Are you sure? OK, I do remember ... and the worst thing is I was semi-serious about it! Did she say yes? She just laughed! What would you stick in Room 101? Broccoli. And alarm clocks. We often have to get up for training at 5am, and when we're finished I certainly won't miss those early mornings. Will you be tempted to completely let yourself go, turning into a bloated alcoholic? [Chuckles] My ego is probably too big for that! I've too much self-regard, too obsessed with how I look. Can you tell us a joke? [Struggles] You know what, I'm more into anecdotes, telling stories and adding little bits on. Fair enough. Can you tell us something funny that happened in the Olympic village this week. Or, even better, a sordid scandal? Actually, this morning when we were in the practice rink, one of the Israeli athletes was trying to tear a Torino 2006 poster off the wall! It seems that as the Games are drawing to the end, everyone who didn't win a medal is stealing all kinds of other souvenirs: I've even seen one guy take the numbers off his room door! I'm telling you, they're going to strip this city bare before it's over! What have you nicked? [Mock outrage] Nothing, no way. I would never dream of doing anything like that! Thanks for the chat, John, and good luck in the world championships in three weeks' time. Cheers, Small Talk, bye.
