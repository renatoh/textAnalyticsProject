He has a part-time job, goes to college, and plans to study A-levels. But a few weeks ago he was kicked out of his family home after being arrested for possession of a knife. The teenager, who had never previously been in trouble with the police, was taken into care and placed temporarily with a family friend until he can be found somewhere permanent to live. Care workers also want to steer him away from a troublesome group of friends. \u201cHe is on the edge,\u201d said Jezz Pratt, a former police officer turned children\u2019s worker. \u201cThe next two to three months are going to be crucial for him. He\u2019s one of those where you could see him in five or six years and he\u2019s happy with a house and a job.\u201d Or, he adds, Matty could be yet another looked-after child who ends up homeless or involved in serious criminality. Matty is one of 66 children in care in North Yorkshire who are part of a pioneering scheme that aims to stop the \u201csystemic problem\u201d of the criminalisation of looked-after children. Those living in care are 15 times more likely to be criminalised than other children, according to research by the Howard League for Penal Reform. Often, looked-after children are prosecuted over minor incidents that would never warrant police action if they happened in family homes. The North Yorkshire initiative, called No Wrong Door, is based on a dedicated team of specialists including a police officer, a clinical psychologist and a speech and language therapist who are based at each of the region\u2019s two council-run children\u2019s homes, in Scarborough and Harrogate. There are no uniforms, no suits and no appointments \u2013 the professionals have a mentor-like relationship with the children based on informal chats over breakfast, in the car, or at the gym. And the scheme is having impressive results: an independent report by Loughborough University found a 38% drop in arrests, a 68% reduction in children going missing, a 33% fall in drug use, and hospital admissions reduced by 92% in its first 18 months from 2015 to 2017. The programme is being rolled out to six other children\u2019s services and has attracted interest from more than 100 councils across Britain, as well as further afield in Australia, the US and the Caribbean. It has won praise from Ofsted, the chief social worker for England, Isabelle Trowler, and Sir Martin Narey, the former director general of prisons. The key to its success is having a specialist team all under one roof. \u201cKids fall out of bed and they need to speak to Ian [the clinical psychologist], they knock on his door,\u201d said Cerena Butterworth, the team manager at the Scarborough home. Each child has a dedicated support worker, who is their consistent point of contact, while the police, council, psychologist and speech therapist \u2013 who ordinarily would have little contact with each other \u2013 work closely in the interests of the child. Although a police officer is based at the children\u2019s home every day, there are no handcuffs or helmets. \u201cIf uniform turns up here, the kids are in crisis because what\u2019s the background for the kid? They see a very negative view of the police because it\u2019s the police turning up arresting mum or dad,\u201d said Neil Millican, the resident police officer, dressed casually in jeans and shirt. \u201cThey go into fight or flight mode and they just fight. Then we\u2019re having to arrest them for assault and they are in that cycle.\u201d Kirsty Basnett, the speech and language therapist, found that 51% of North Yorkshire\u2019s looked-after children (and as many as two-thirds of those in residential care) had previously undiagnosed speech and language communication needs (SLCN), such as stammering and lack of eye contact, as well as wider problems with understanding language. One girl with a previously undiagnosed SLCN was being arrested on a daily basis for breaching bail conditions that prohibited her from visiting a particular street in Scarborough. She would become angry at being arrested, leading to further arrests. Only when she was diagnosed did professionals realise that she simply could not understand the terms of her bail condition. They took her to the street to explain where she was not allowed to go and overnight she stopped offending. \u201cThese kids would never normally be seen by someone like me,\u201d said Basnett. \u201cThese are kids that are often forgotten about. People see the behaviour but don\u2019t connect that with the communication difficulty \u2013 that\u2019s why we need to be embedded [in children\u2019s homes], otherwise it\u2019s just lip service.\u201d \u201cIt comes down to: would it be good enough for my child?\u201d said James Cliffe, who runs the Scarborough home, where Halloween decorations are dotted around a CS Lewis quote on the dining room wall: \u201cYou can\u2019t go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending.\u201d On Matty, Cliffe said the coming weeks would be crucial, but he was optimistic: \u201cI am very hopeful for him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
