Police teams and army bomb disposal experts were sent to the scene in Vigo, a village near Meopham, after witnesses described hearing an \"almighty explosion\" just after 1pm. The woman, in her 30s and heavily pregnant according to some reports, had been travelling in the car with two children. A 32-year-old man was later arrested by police. \"I ran out of the house and as I opened the door I saw the car on fire with the front completely blown off. It had disintegrated,\" said one witness. \"Her husband and my other neighbour ran towards the car and dragged the woman on to the pavement. I called the emergency services while the two others were trying to calm the woman down on the pavement. She was in a bad way.\" He added: \"Amazingly the little boy was pretty much unscathed, apart from he was crying that he had sore ears.\" The witness said the woman suffered serious injuries to her legs and that neighbours used T-shirts and towels to stem the bleeding. Kent police described the woman's injuries as serious but not life threatening. The two children, who escaped uninjured, were reportedly being comforted by neighbours. Another witness, Frances Sentance, 50, a school meals assistant at the local primary school, said: \"I was sitting in my kitchen when I heard a huge bang. I ran outside to see what was happening and there was smoke billowing from the wreckage and rising over the trees. \"Within 10 minutes, the area was flooded with fire engines, ambulances and police. An air ambulance also landed. We're all shocked. It is horrific.\" It is believed that the woman lived in the village, although police have not confirmed details. A spokeswoman for Kent police said a cordon had been put in place and three nearby roads closed off, and homes within the cordon area had been evacuated. She said a bomb disposal team had been sent out as a precautionary measure before the police could begin a full forensic examination of the scene. Those evacuated from their homes were relocated to a temporary shelter in the village hall. Forensic examiners are to carry out a detailed investigation of the car. ."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
