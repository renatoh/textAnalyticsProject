After breakfast I realised with horror I'd left all the cables for my laptop in an internet cafe the previous day. Facing the prospect of 16 days at sea with a useless computer, I ran down to the cabin of Les, the Captain. 'What time are we sailing,' I blurted. 'At 10am, with or without you,' he informed me sternly. I had one hour. Hailing a taxi in Auckland's morning rush hour is about as easy as finding jellied eels in Chelsea. I ran in and out of the traffic like a man possessed, frantically flagging anything vaguely resembling a cab. Spotting my agitated state, an already occupied taxi pulled over. 'Need a ride,' asked the cabbie. 'Yes,' I squeaked, apologising profusely to the very understanding female passenger, and leapt in. Nash, the driver, was originally from Delhi and, having dropped off the woman, expertly negotiated the comparably simple traffic of Auckland to convey me across town and back to the ship before it sailed. Dining with Captain Les and John, the ship's chief engineer, thrice daily for a fortnight meant we covered huge tracts of conversational ground. Both John and Les were close to, if not past, retirement age and there were some striking inter-generational differences in attitude. Their opinions weren't that unusual among a certain demographic in New Zealand, however. One grey-haired acquaintance grilled us on whether we would buy a German-built car. 'From our enemies,' he added with a conspiratorial wink. During the lively dining table discussions we built up a fondness for the curmudgeonly stance that Les and John often adopted as we took them to task on their circa-1971 views. When we left the ship in Ensenada, Mexico, it was with genuinely mixed feelings: relief at being on dry land, but a pinch of regret that the shipboard routine was over. We'd become institutionalised worryingly fast. Mexico soon worked its way into our affections, though, as we bumbled our way down through Baja California. The further we got from the US border the more sensible the portions served at mealtimes became. Twice in Ensenada we'd physically reeled at the sheer, vulgar amount of food we were expected to shove into our faces at one sitting. Fearing a Stateside-style bloating of the belly, we swiftly swung into a 'one meal a day' routine, aided by a bout or two of what the Mexicans cutely refer to as 'las turistas'. Baja is mission country and peppered with 17th-century Jesuit churches built to convert the indigenous people of the peninsula. In Loreto we visited a mission museum that described the impact of their activities with knowing understatement. 'Some natives were resistant to changes like becoming sedentary, wearing clothing, and giving up their religious beliefs and the practice of polygamy.' Frankly I was surprised there wasn't more resistance from a populace faced with a credo of 'stay there, wear these, worship this and stop all this sex'. The missions flourished over their first few decades despite the harsh environment, but were undermined by the minor problem of a tragically diminishing congregation. In less than 100 years the indigenous population of Baja fell from over 40,000 to under 4,000, largely due to diseases the Jesuits and others introduced. Now that's what I call salvation. lowcarbontravel.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
