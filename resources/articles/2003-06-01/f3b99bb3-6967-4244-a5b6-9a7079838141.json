There were fears that injury would complicate Clive Woodward's plans on the eve of England's departure today for the first leg of their summer tour in New Zealand. Woodman missed Gloucester's Zurich Championship final defeat at Twickenham with an ankle problem and Simpson-Daniel needed scans on his right ankle after the match to dispel fears of a fracture. Leicester's England contingent were largely unscathed after their wild card final with Saracens, although the gash over Martin Corry's left eye would have been a concern. Harlequins' Ben Gollings has been banned for three weeks after being sent off for lashing out with his boot in England's 14-10 win over New Zealand in the quarter-finals of the IRB Sevens tournament in Cardiff."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
