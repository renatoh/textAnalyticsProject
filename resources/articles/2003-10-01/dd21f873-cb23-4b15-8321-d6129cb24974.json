The move came as the EU approved a modest 200m euros (\u00a3141m) of reconstruction aid for Iraq. Security council members led by France have refused to give UN sanction to the occupation - which would be the first stage of a process intended to bring on board troops from countries such as India and Pakistan - unless the US sets a clear date for the transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqis. Today's US draft resolution, seen by the Associated Press, instead offers a timetable to a timetable for the eventual transfer. If passed it would require the US-appointed governing council to submit a programme for the drafting of a new constitution and holding democratic elections by December 15. The US ambassador to the UN, John Negroponte, who holds the council's rotating presidency for October, said Washington would seek a vote on the resolution this week. Earlier drafts of the resolution that had not mentioned any timetable for elections or a new constitution were the subject of extensive negotiations but were not put to a vote. It is unclear how far the new draft's approach will go towards assuaging other council members' concerns. As before, the draft calls for the creation of a multinational force to help maintain security in Iraq. But unlike the previous draft, it says the security council will review the force's mission no later than a year after the resolution is passed. It also addresses concerns from the UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan, who had demanded a lead role for the organisation in post-war Iraq. The draft says the UN \"should strengthen its vital role in Iraq\" and could help to restore representative government. The Bush administration launched a review of the resolution after disagreements from council diplomats and Mr Annan's statements. The US and Britain have said Iraq must first have a constitution and hold elections before they relinquish sovereignty. France, Russia and Germany, which fought off a UK-backed draft resolution in March explicitly authorising military action against Iraq, are seeking a quick transfer of power to a provisional Iraqi government and want the UN to have the major role in overseeing the country's political transition to a democracy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
