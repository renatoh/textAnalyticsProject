The Liverpool manager believes his squad do not require an overhaul, having shown their quality during a strong second half to the season, but an injection of proven quality to enhance prospects of a return to the Champions League. Ashley Young of Aston Villa and Blackpool's Charlie Adam are among the targets and Dalglish admits FSG will make substantial funds available. \"The squad only needs tinkering,\" said Dalglish. \"If people want to see the best players and assets of the football club wearing a red shirt, that's what we want to try and provide. We want to get the highest quality of player in that we can. That's what position we have been put into, and that's what we will try to do. \"The owners just want the same as the football club. Everything they can afford to put into transfers they will put in. There's no figure on it, and even if there was we wouldn't publicise it. But the desire is there and the intention is there. A good way to judge it is that the owners were disappointed we didn't bring more players in in January. \"People might be cynical and say we got Ryan Babel and Fernando Torres out and almost balanced the books with bringing in Luis [Su\u00e1rez] and Andy [Carroll], but Luis was coming in anyway before Fernando went, so the owners' intention was there. Damien [Comolli, director of football] has done a fantastic job identifying players and whittling it down to a small number to make it more manageable for us to look at what we want. It's all in place ready to go. We just need to get somebody to say yes.\" Defeat at home to Tottenham Hotspur last Sunday could cost Liverpool a place in the Europa League next season but Dalglish is confident a lack of European competition would not deter his targets from coming to Anfield. He added: \"Whether it affects people positively or negatively, you'll need to ask the individuals. But our football club is much bigger than just one season not being in Europe.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
