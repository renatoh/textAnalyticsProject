Laws said the money would fund the second phase of the priority school building programme and run from 2015 to 2021. He was speaking at the reopening of Whitmore Park primary school in Coventry, which is the first school to be rebuilt under the programme. Laws praised the programme for its value for money but Nick Forbes, the vice-chair of the Local Government Association's children and young people board, said that it would work more efficiently if councils were able to work with local schools and academies to decide priorities. \"There are some schools with significant problems with their buildings and it is vital this money reaches those schools with the greatest need. Councils would be able to repair crumbling classrooms more quickly if money was passed straight to local areas rather than disseminated through a national bidding process,\" Forbes said. Mary Bousted, the general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, described the extra funds as \"a drop in the ocean\". \"Hundreds of thousands of children are still in dilapidated schools with leaking roofs, draughty or baking rooms which this second phase of school building will not change,\" Bousted said. \"This coalition government has an unfortunate habit of scrapping key education programmes and then introducing small-scale replacement schemes with a large fanfare.\" Making the announcement, Laws said that a total of \u00a318bn was being spent on school buildings over the course of this parliament. \"Thanks to the decisions we have taken to improve efficiency and reduce waste in central school building programmes, this government is building or improving the condition of almost 900 schools \u2013 twice as many as the previous government,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
