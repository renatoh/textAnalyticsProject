The news came as it was confirmed that two planes carrying aid to Liberia, organised by Save the Children and Oxfam, have now reached the capital Monrovia. The Liberia Crisis Appeal, launched on Tuesday by 11 charities under the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) umbrella, was launched with television appeals on both BBC and ITV by former EastEnders star Ross Kemp. DEC said the two aid flights had cost between \u00a3150,000 and \u00a3200,000 each, so the amount raised by the appeal so far could pay for the equivalent of two more flights. The appeal hotlines took 20,000 calls overnight, with an average credit card donation of \u00a330. Almost \u00a350,000 was raised via the DEC's website the same night, and donations by post and over the counter at post offices and banks were expected to quickly match this figure. The DEC chief executive, Brendan Gormley, said: \"The appeal has raised half a million overnight, which means that we are on target for our first million. \"However, one million pounds raised means one pound for each of the one million Liberians in desperate need, so more money is urgently needed. We know how generous the British people are and the suffering people of Liberia need that generosity now.\" An estimated one million people are either trapped in appalling conditions in Liberia's cities or cut off from help in the countryside. With west African peacekeeping troops in the capital, Monrovia, and US troops off the coast, aid agencies are expanding their work as they are able to reach more families who have been cut off because of the fighting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
