Among a two-hour stream of product announcements at the annual Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) event, Apple engineers demonstrated the latest update of Apple\u2019s smartphone software iOS, which will let iPhone users add larger emojis, see photos and videos appear in a stream of text messages, add animated effects and \u201cemojify\u201d messages by converting typed words into emojis. Opening the event with a moment of silence for the victims of the weekend\u2019s shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Apple\u2019s CEO, Tim Cook \u2013 who has become a leader on gay rights issues since talking about his own sexuality in 2014 \u2013 called the attacks a \u201csenseless, unconscionable act of terrorism and hate aimed at dividing and destroying\u201d. Cook then set about laying out his vision for a future in which Apple\u2019s software forms the central hub of its customers\u2019 lives, helping track their fitness, send love notes, navigate the road and trade pictures of cute dogs. More playful messages Apple is clearly responding to the voice of the consumer; Messages is the most popular app on iOS, and the new features are designed to offer more playful options that replicate some successful third-party messaging apps. \u201cWe\u2019re providing emoji predictions as you type,\u201d said Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s senior vice-president of software engineering. \u201cWhen you tap on the emoji button, we\u2019ll highlight all the emoji-fiable words.\u201d Federighi also went slightly off script, joking that \u201cthe children of tomorrow will have no understanding of the English language\u201d. Clicking on the camera icon in Messages will immediately show the camera live, and the demonstration showed some shots that appeared slightly more perfect than real life. It was a rare moment of candor in an otherwise characteristically veneered Apple presentation. \u201cSomeone in marketing thought that was what you\u2019d see if you saw through the camera ... such an incongruous set of images.\u201d Digital assistant The iPhone maker is also betting heavily on winning a multi-front battle with Google, Facebook and Amazon to create a market-defining digital assistant that helps people make tiny decisions or suggests relevant information throughout the day, such as which emoji to use, which family member to tag in a photo, or the best time in your diary to get to the gym. Apple plans to add machine-learning smarts to its messaging app, better predicting the content of texts between any two people communicating with iPhones. At the same time, it announced it would open the technical innards of its Siri virtual assistant to outside developers who can make other intelligent apps.Consumers could just ask Siri how long it would take for a Lyft or Uber to show up, rather than opening an app. Siri also will begin working on Apple\u2019s desktop and laptop computers. In one demonstration, Federighi showed how he could ask Siri to gather up all emails from a certain co-worker about a certain topic. Apple\u2019s desire to get more people to use Siri comes as other Silicon Valley giants release their own digital butlers. Amazon.com has Alexa, which will query the internet and adjust the lights in a room for users; Facebook has M; and Google announced its own Google Assistant in May. Privacy features Apple did, however, break with the larger technology industry over at least one issue: privacy. As Silicon Valley tries to offer more products that analyze vast amounts of consumer data to better predict how people will make decisions, it often requires users to forgo certain modern privacy tools, such as strong encryption. That\u2019s because the companies usually can only analyze consumer behavior by monitoring their messages, scanning their photos and tracking their movements. These computations are done by running all of this data through corporate servers. In May, Google announced that Allo, its new messaging app, would only offer digital assistant features if users don\u2019t turn on an optional strong encryption feature. Facebook will also make its new encryption technology on its Messenger app optional for similar reasons, people familiar with the project said. Apple, by contrast, said such machine-learning computations will be done on users\u2019 devices, rather than company servers. Because of this, the company says its Messages app will continue to offer end-to-end encryption by default. Other updates Apple is also renaming its operating system, the latest version of which is called macOS Sierra. Updates include a shared clipboard, so that content and links can be shared between connected iPhones, iPads and Macs, a feature that will free up disk space by backing up less-used content on iCloud, and its payment service Apple Pay, which can now be used on desktop sites. Apple\u2019s latest watch software, WatchOS 3, speeds up changes between apps, adds text input by typing individual letters on screen and allows users to unlock their desktops with the presence of their watch, saving the effort of typing a password. macOS, iOS 10 and WatchOS are all expected to be released in a public beta trial in July and on general release in the autumn. WWDC comes as Apple faces a challenging future. In April, Apple reported its first sales decline in 13 years. The company, while still massively successful, appears to be reaching a saturation point with its popular products, such as the iPhone and iPad. Its latest piece of hardware, Apple Watch, has faced consistently mixed reviews. Apple\u2019s annual developer conference isn\u2019t normally the site of sweeping product announcements. The audience is full of coders and Apple tends to focus on minor tweaks that may only elicit applause from an enthralled audience deep in the weeds of app design. When Federighi announced the shared clipboard, there was an audible gasp. At another point, Bozoma Saint John, head of consumer marketing for Apple Music, boldly tried to show off a new \u201clyrics\u201d feature by getting the audience to rap along to Sugarhill Gang\u2019s classic Rapper\u2019s Delight. She quickly gave up after declaring the audience was not, as the song instructs, \u201crapping to the beat\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
