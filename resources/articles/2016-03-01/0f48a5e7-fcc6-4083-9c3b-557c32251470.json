The head coach is also launching a search for a couple of new \u201cJonny Wilkinsons\u201d to propel his squad further towards their goal of becoming the No1 team in the world. England\u2019s 31-21 victory over France in Paris completed a remarkable journey from World Cup pool flops to grand slam champions but Jones is already eyeing bigger and better things. Asked what would represent a successful tour down under, he replied: \u201cThree-nil, that\u2019d be a super tour. Then I\u2019d stay in Australia for a week and gloat. \u201cLook, it is fantastic to get a grand slam, fantastic to win the Six Nations but we want to be the No1 team in the world. To do that we have to go down to Australia, beat Australia and then we will have started getting on the road. In the next two to three years we\u2019ll have a side to beat the All Blacks.\u201d For that to happen Jones is seeking more standout players, such as the Saracens lock Maro Itoje. \u201cWe need a few guys to come through to really push the envelope. We need them to come in, say, \u2018This isn\u2019t good enough\u2019 and lift the level again. I\u2019m looking for guys like a young Jonny Wilkinson. The 2003 lot still talk about when Jonny came into training as a young kid and turned the Bunsen burner up. The whole level of training increased because he had no fear and he wanted to be No1 in the world. I need to find a couple of those kids. We\u2019ll work harder, work smarter and pick better players.\u201d That search will begin imminently. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go to a Premiership game and they have got to be yelling at me to pick them. By yelling I mean they\u2019ve got to stand out so, if you came from Mars, you\u2019d know they\u2019re international players.\u201d Jones is also planning to appoint a permanent scrum coach and a temporary assistant attack coach who shares his philosophy, while Dylan Hartley is set to retain the captaincy for the Wallaby tour: \u201cAt this stage there\u2019s no reason why Dylan won\u2019t be captain as long as he keeps improving as a player.\u201d England\u2019s players, meanwhile, have hailed Jones\u2019s input in the short period since he took over a squad that sank in the World Cup pool stages. \u201cI think there were some great foundations from Stuart\u2019s time but Eddie\u2019s a world-class coach,\u201d said the Harlequins scrum-half Danny Care, among England\u2019s try-scorers in Paris. \u201cHe\u2019s been there before, he\u2019s done it, he knows how to win and he\u2019s instilled a confidence in the team.\u201d Jones feels the toughest part of his job has been to change the mindset of the squad in terms of their approach to games but insists the players deserve the plaudits. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from a team knocked out in the pool stages of a World Cup to grand slam champions. Only 13 teams in the history of English rugby have done [the latter] and the players deserve the majority of the credit for that. We just need to have more courage about the way we play. In the first half we were just sitting back a little bit. \u201cDefensively we weren\u2019t off the line hard and getting into them. That was probably the least physical we\u2019ve been in the whole tournament.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
