Except it wasn't quite as simple as that. For while Denton did take the money and did help set up the ambush, it wasn't because she was corrupt or eager to make a quick buck. Instead, a subtle, downbeat and at times unbearably tense episode peeled back the layers to show how one simple mistake on Denton's behalf \u2013 the decision to try to save Carly Kirk, a decision probably made because of Carly's comment about her mother \u2013 led to the death of four officers and a life sentence. At the end of Lindsay's extended flashback, as we saw her confront Tommy in his guise as Alex Campbell, subsequently receive a visit from Jane Akers and agree to the ambush largely because her unknowing mother tells her to start living her life, it was impossible not to feel for this most complex of anti-heroines. Yes, she was guilty, and yes, innocent people died, but I ended Line of Duty feeling completely sympathetic towards her. For most of her life Lindsay Denton did the right thing, kept her head down and played by the book, and it got her nowhere. She was lonely and broke with a sick mother and had aborted a child (\"it will haunt me for the rest of my life\") after an unsuitable affair that ended abruptly, which she was struggling to cope with. She saw a chance to help a stranger by doing a piece of proper cop work and it ended in mayhem, murder and eventually jail. Poor Lindsay \u2013 when she turned to a rather smug Fleming and said: \"You don't know me,\" I could only sadly agree. Well done to Jed Mercurio and co for a powerful, satisfying and, best of all, believable conclusion that, while quieter than the end to series one, resonated far more. The good guys AC-12 finally got their woman in an episode that saw Hastings back on the moral high ground (and I did quietly cheer his \"If it were me I'd throw the book at you\" \u2013 I love Ted when he's being all Norn Iron and self-righteous) and Arnott putting his ninja-level seduction skills to good use against Denton. I can't say I approve of him using his eyebrows to entrap lonely single women \u2013 even if they are guilty \u2013 but it was cunning (and I did give another quiet cheer when he told Fleming: \"She underestimates me just like you always do.\" Good point, Steve). As for Fleming herself, Vicky McClure has been excellent throughout this series and I've been fascinated by the slow reveal of the chinks in Fleming's armour. It has been genuinely refreshing to see that storyline played out with a female rather than a male lead, and I liked the brief scene of her drunkenly demanding entry to her former home. The bad guys Oh Dot, Dot, Dot, you really are the Dudley Smith of Line of Duty and I look forward to seeing what nefarious deeds you get up to now you've been promoted to AC-12. The meeting with Akers proved that far from having gone straight, our Dot was a prime mover in the decision to get rid of the erratic Tommy \u2013 not so much a reformed character as a very willing recidivist. If I were Hastings, I'd be on permanent guard for what threatens to be an army of knives in the back. As to the other bad guys: Dryden lost his job, and, if we can believe Les, that may have been more of a tragedy then presumed (one of the things I like about this show is the way the bad guys generally have some redeeming features), while Prasad \u2013 the hand that pulled the actual trigger \u2013 got his immunity and lived to weasel through another day. We also finally got to meet Jane Akers properly. The scene between her and Lindsay was a small gem of tension and clashing willpowers, nicely mirrored by the later confrontation between Denton and Fleming. Additional notes \u2022 There was a level of enjoyment in seeing Dot stranded on a golf course, of all places, as the wily Nige got the better of him, wasn't there? I also liked Dot and Nige's mutually assured destruction pact; never kid a kidder, Dot. \u2022 I know not everyone likes them, but I'm rather fond of the final \"what happened next\" bits. They break the laws of TV a bit, but they're done with a nice nod and wink. . \u2022 Kudos to those who questioned whether the body was Carly's or not. I was pleased to see that young Ms Kirk made it out of the whole mess alive, although what about her poor foster parents, who seemed genuinely distraught? \u2022 I'm still unsure how I feel about the Arnott/Rogerson hook-up. I expect Jolly to have better taste, and what of poor Georgia, Steve? Denied even a final mention despite her shocking death \u2026 \u2022 The acting was fantastic throughout this series, with Keeley Hawes especially wonderful (what a game-changing career shift for her). And what about Adrian Dunbar, whose quiet certainty gave us something to cling on to when things were getting bad? Mark Bonnar was wonderfully weaselly and Vicky McClure's subtle performance was more affecting by the week. Weasel of the week As ever, there were many to choose from, but I think Manish Prasad just about squeaks it. It takes some chutzpah to literally get away with murder. In Line of Duty's world, only the truly bad guys prosper. Quote of the week \"I meant lucky that you have a mother that buys you nice things.\" And with that one simple statement, delivered by a motherless 15-year-old to a lonely, childless woman, a chain of events was set in place that led to countless deaths and the imprisonment for life of Lindsay Denton. Finally, I'd like to thank everyone who takes the time to comment on here each week. You've had fantastic theories and hopefully you agree with me that this was a fitting end.
