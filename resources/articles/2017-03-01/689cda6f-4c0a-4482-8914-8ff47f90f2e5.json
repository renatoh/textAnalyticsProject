Labor has welcomed the political backflip and said the government is now isolated in opposing efforts to reverse penalty rate cuts. On Tuesday Labor passed an urgency motion in the Senate condemning Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s \u201clack of empathy for Australian workers who rely on penalty rates to make ends meet\u201d. The motion passed with the Greens, One Nation, NXT, Derryn Hinch and Jacqui Lambie\u2019s support. Nick Xenophon has confirmed to Guardian Australia he will now support the Labor, Greens and Lambie bill to block the current round of penalty rate cuts and prevent future cuts by the Fair Work Commission that reduce take-home pay. In comments explaining the backflip in the Adelaide Advertiser, Xenophon said: \u201cThe bottom line is none of us want to see workers have their pay cut in an environment when there\u2019s low wage growth and an increasing number of people are under wage stress.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll own up to this being a backflip, or even somersault, because you can\u2019t have individual workers being worse off.\u201d The bill will be debated on Thursday and will pass, after Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation backflipped to support the bill on Monday and NXT changed its position on Tuesday night. \u201cI expect it will get though the Senate, and it\u2019s now a matter for the house to consider,\u201d Xenophon said. The Turnbull government holds 76 seats in the 150-member lower house, meaning the bill would require crossbench support and at least one Coalition member to cross the floor to pass. On 23 February the FWC cut Sunday and public holiday penalty rates in the retail, pharmacy, fast food and hospitality industries by between 25% and 50%. The commission is still considering transitional arrangements, such as phasing in the cuts over a number of years. On Monday Xenophon was criticised by Labor for being \u201call talk\u201d on penalty rates after failing to make a submission to FWC. At that time Xenophon suggested he would try to find another way to protect existing workers\u2019 take-home pay, but has now arrived at the Labor and Greens position to overturn the FWC decision. At a doorstop in Canberra on Wednesday shadow employment minister, Brendan O\u2019Connor, said he welcomed Xenophon, Hanson and Hinch\u2019s decision to support the bill despite their \u201clifelong interest in support of cutting penalty rates\u201d. \u201c[The crossbenchers\u2019 support] exposes the government, the government is isolated ... they stand alone in supporting a decision that will have dire effects on low-paid workers in this country, and they stand condemned for that.\u201d \u201cMalcolm Turnbull\u2019s penalty rate cut cannot be moderated or transitioned \u2013 it must be stopped completely,\u201d he said. Asked about the Australian Council of Trade Union\u2019s claim for a $45 a-week increase in the minimum wage, O\u2019Connor noted it was \u201chigher than in past\u201d and said Labor would support a fair increase in the minimum wage that helped it keep up with increases in average wages. In submissions to the Fair Work Commission, United Voice has asked for a $87 a week increase, which would achieve its target of the minimum wage being 60% of average weekly earnings with one large increase this year. The Australian Industry Group has called for a \u201cmodest\u201d increase of 1.5%, or about $10.10 per week. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has labelled the ACTU claim \u201cirresponsible\u201d, arguing it will add to unemployment. On Tuesday in question time Turnbull accused the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, of flip-flopping on his support for the independent Fair Work Commission, noting that before the 2016 election Shorten committed to support its decision, even if it cut penalty rates."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
