Abbott said the original policy, introduced in 1980 by Margaret Thatcher, had led to one-third of all homes sold under it falling into the hands of private landlords who then let them out at higher rents at huge cost to the state in housing benefit. Expanding it to include tenants of housing associations, which are independent bodies, would destroy their economic impact, she argued. \u201cThe Tory proposal to allow people to buy their housing association flats at big discounts is just criminal,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re attempting to bribe the electorate with assets that did not belong to them.\u201d The Conservatives\u2019 plan to expand the right-to-buy scheme to allow England\u2019s 1.3 million housing association tenants was a headline pledge of their general election campaign. Under the plans, tenants can purchase their homes at discounts of up to \u00a377,000 outside London or \u00a3102,700 in the capital. The original right-to-buy scheme was hugely successful, but the recent extension has been widely criticised. Speaking at a Guardian Live event on the housing crisis in London, Abbott, a London mayoral hopeful, said Labour\u2019s housing policies during the election were too timid. She claimed the Conservatives\u2019 housing benefit cap, which Labour has failed to oppose, is resulting in social cleansing in London by forcing councils to relocate families out of the capital into cheaper areas of the country. \u201cWhat the government is saying is that poor people should not live in zones one and two,\u201d Abbot said. \u201cWe will become like Paris, where only the middle and upper classes can live in the centre.\u201d The MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington said the majority of her constituents would not be able to buy a home in the area and called for rent controls and stricter regulations for landlords. \u201cAnything that cools the market would be a good thing,\u201d she said. Non-domiciled overseas investors should be prevented from buying up new London homes before they are made available to British buyers, Abbott argued, and developers should not be allowed to avoid their obligation to build homes for social housing. New social homes should also be rented at rates determined by average local wages, she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
