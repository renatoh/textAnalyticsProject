Hastie and Liberal senator James Paterson were due to travel to Beijing in December with Labor MP Matt Keogh as part of a study tour. The pair were denied visas after being critical of Beijing, with the Chinese embassy in Canberra calling on the two Liberal MPs to \u201crepent and redress their mistakes\u201d. But Hastie said he has no intention of scaling back his criticism of Chinese attempts to exert influence in Australia and human rights abuses against Uighurs in Xinjiang province. \u201cSenator James Paterson and I will not repent,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me be very clear, we will not repent for standing up for Australian sovereignty, our values, our interests, and for those who can\u2019t speak for themselves.\u201d The West Australian MP admits his chances of visiting China are slim. \u201cI am very much open to a trip in the new year, but I suspect unless I repent I won\u2019t be welcome. There will be no repentance,\u201d he said. A statement from the embassy had said that China was open to \u201cconstructive dialogue and exchanges\u201d with people from all over the world based on \u201cmutual respect, equality and seeking common ground while reserving differences\u201d. \u201cThe Chinese people do not welcome those who make unwarranted attacks, wantonly exert pressure on China, challenge China\u2019s sovereignty, disrespect China\u2019s dignity and undermine mutual trust between China and Australia,\u201d the embassy said. \u201cThe colonial days of Western powers are long gone. China will never yield to colonisation of ideas and values. \u201cAs long as the people concerned genuinely repent and redress their mistakes, view China with objectivity and reason, respect China\u2019s system and mode of development chosen by the Chinese people, the door of dialogue and exchanges will always remain open.\u201d The China Matters thinktank, which organised the study tour, said the embassy had objected to publicity surrounding the tour after it was revealed Paterson and Hastie had been invited on the trip. \u201cIt is most unfortunate that the names of the politicians who had accepted our invitation to join the study tour in December became public in advance,\u201d China Matters said on Friday. \u201cThe media attention that ensued created an environment which was no longer conducive to our goal of facilitating low-key discussions and exchanging differing points of view behind closed doors.\u201d \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Hastie drew the ire of colleagues when an opinion piece he wrote in August criticised China\u2019s authoritarian rise and likened the complacency about Xi Jinping\u2019s philosophy and intentions to Europe\u2019s response to Nazi Germany before World War II. He has also spoken out about Chinese influence in Australia and human rights abuses against the Uighur population in Xinjiang province. Paterson has also been a fierce critic of the Chinese, raising concerns about the risk of Chinese influence at Australian universities and the escalating violence in Hong Kong. Paterson told ABC news on Friday, that he would continue to exercise his freedom of speech. \u201cHong Kong is one of the most amazing places in the world and what is happening there is an absolute tragedy and I believe the Communist Party bears some responsibility for that.\u201d Labor frontbencher Stephen Jones called the decision to block the MPs unfortunate, saying more would be gained by allowing them to get a better understanding of China. \u201cIf the purpose behind this is to try and change their minds or change the things they\u2019re going to say, I rather suspect it\u2019s going to have the opposite impact knowing these two people,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201c[It\u2019s] probably playing into their hands rather than the other way.\u201d Australian Associated Press contributed to this report"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
