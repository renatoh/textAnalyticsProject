But alongside the iconic figures of Freya Stark and Gertrude Bell, it also refreshingly pays tribute to foreign women who travelled to Britain: women like Pocahontas, Queen Emma of Hawaii and Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, the first president of the United Nations. Pocahontas, a Native American from the Powhatan Renape Nation in Virginia, arrived in England in the spring of 1616 with her husband, John Rolfe. She was 21. The following year she died of TB and was buried in Gravesend, Kent. She has subsequently become a legend, a bendy toy and a Disney cartoon. But how did she feel about being here, among the English? I rang the gallery and scoured the internet in an attempt to find out, locating biographies for adults and children. I learned that Pocahontas was a nickname, her real name being Matoaka, and that the Powhatan people were incandescent about her identity being claimed by the whites who had colonised their land and decimated their people. I read a tremendous amount about her, but not a single word of how she actually felt about the experiences that made up her short and dramatic life. The British tradition of literary travel writing has usually been one-way traffic, almost all of it written by middle-class white people, like me, about our travels to poorer countries where most of the people are not white. Little seems to have changed in the past 300 years. We still pay scant attention to the experiences of writers who have come here, black or white, and there is a particular dearth of any kind of travel writing by foreign women, with the exceptions of a handful of ghost-written autobiographies of Middle Eastern princesses, and painful memoirs by Chinese women who grew up as victims of the cultural revolution. When it comes to black or Asian women telling their own stories, we seem to like them to have suffered for the privilege. I spent six months in China about a decade ago, and though it was and remains a politically oppressive state, there is more to the lives of its hundreds of millions of women than just relentless suffering. The Chinese women I know who live in the UK tell me they are dismayed at the constant bias in western reports about their country. But there are occasional and vital exceptions to this rule. Shuyun Sun grew up in Beijing, moved to Oxford to attend university, and is now a documentary film-maker and the author of Ten Thousand Miles Without a Cloud, which was published to acclaim last year. The book, which chronicles Sun's journey across China and India in the footsteps of an eighth-century Buddhist monk, was inspired by the life of her grandmother, a tenacious Buddhist who was mocked and bullied for her Dharma practice during the cultural revolution. Bridging the fault-line between travel writing and memoir, Sun makes this a physical and spiritual journey that is very much her own. Another rare memoir by an Asian woman is The Tiger Ladies, by Sudha Koul, about growing up in Kashmir, \"the most beautiful place on earth\". She doesn't so much describe as paint the colours of life both before and during the slow-burning war that is still ravaging her country. Although she moved to America with her husband when she was 30, her love for Kashmir is the theme, and the book interweaves commentary on these two paradoxical cultures and their peoples' views of each other. \"I am by now,\" she says, \"used to [American] people asking me if I can tell them how Indians can marry sight unseen, or wear marks on their foreheads, or if my husband and I have Tantric sex.\" You can almost hear her shaking her head as she says it. But her ultimate and generous description of life in the state of New Jersey is of \"two-way traffic, a uniquely American phenomenon\". I wonder whether the British lack of literary two-way traffic reflects a basic lack of curiosity about the rest of the world and our relationship to it. We are, after all, an island people. Literature is a powerful tool, showering us with ideas about who and where we are, and where else we could think of being. But if the preferences of readers and publishers ensure that the same voices continue to be heard, our views will become myopic and dissent a distant echo. I can't help thinking of two books about Afghanistan, which I think between them encapsulate why diversity is vital not only to travel writing but to literature as a whole. Asne Seierstad's controversial bestseller, The Bookseller of Kabul, published in the UK last year, is a political polemic documenting the Norwegian journalist's four-month stay with a Kabul bookseller and his family. Removing herself completely from the narrative, Seierstad stereotypes her Afghan characters into parodies of male oppressors and female victims, with absolutely nothing in between - no personal defiance, no national resistance, and no hope. She does not speak the family language, Dari, but none the less claims the right to interpret the thoughts and feelings of her host and his family for herself. And they, as was recently reported in Anthropology Today, remain understandably angry at having had their identities claimed by this outsider who was also their guest. Saira Shah, who comes from a British Afghan family, took a far greater risk in writing The Storyteller's Daughter, an intensely personal account of the beauty, ruin and paradoxes of Afghanistan, and her return to this country from which her father was exiled. Yasmin Alibhai-Brown called it a book that \"does not forgive the unforgivable\", but it also utterly refuses to pander to type. Above all, Shah is telling her own messy, brave story. There are many other writers - both men and women - from \"off the beaten track\", who have extraordinary, messy stories to tell, and if we don't read them for ourselves, direct from the narrators, the loss is ultimately ours. \u00b7 \"Off the Beaten Track\" continues at the National Portrait Gallery until October 31 \u00b7 Hearing Birds Fly: A Year in a Mongolian Village by Louisa Waugh (Abacus, \u00a37.99) is on the shortlist for next month's Thomas Cook travel book award"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
