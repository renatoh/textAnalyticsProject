The move is being made in order to overcome regulatory hurdles to its bid for the supermarket chain. Sainsbury's is in talks with a number of potential buyers including Wal-Mart, the US giant considering its own bid for Safeway through Asda, which it owns. Several private equity houses, including US-based Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Royal Bank Private Equity, are also thought to be interested in buying the Safeway stores. \"It is a very fluid situation. There are a number of hats in the ring - property firms, private equity houses and trade,\" a source said. Sainsbury's, Britain's second-biggest supermarket group, has said that overlaps with Safeway stores mean it would have to sell 90 outlets, mostly in southern England, to get the deal past regulators. Asda, ranked at number three, faces similar hurdles. The bidding war for Safeway, Britain's fourth-biggest supermarket group, was sparked by Morrisons last week when the Bradford-based company announced an agreed takeover worth \u00a32.4bn at today's share price. While Morrisons has little overlap with Safeway, both Asda and Sainsbury's do, representing a potential red flag for the competition authorities. Safeway agreed to merge with Morrisons because it is struggling against its bigger rivals, a fact underlined by the latest industry survey. According to Taylor Nelson Sofres, Safeway's market share, based on till receipts, slipped 0.5% to 9.8% in the 12 weeks to January 5 compared with a year ago. Safeway recently embarked on a recovery strategy, but that effort appears to have stalled in the face of fierce competition. Asda, gaining market share more quickly than its rivals, grew 0.6% to 16.6%, while market leader Tesco increased its share to 25.8% from 25.4%. Sainsbury fell to 17.2% from 17.6% overall, while Morrisons brings up the rear with 6%, an increase of 0.1%. Meanwhile, Credit Suisse First Boston gave up its job as broker to Safeway to begin advising Kohlberg Kravis Roberts as the venture capital firm considers a move for Safeway stores. Safeway has appointed Schroder Salomon Smith Barney as its joint house broker, alongside West LB Panmure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
