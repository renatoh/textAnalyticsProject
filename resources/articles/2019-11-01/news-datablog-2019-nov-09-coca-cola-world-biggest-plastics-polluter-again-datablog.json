The environmental justice group asked 72,541 volunteers in 51 countries to collect plastic waste. Almost half (43%) of what they found were clearly marked consumer brands. Coca-Cola was named the world\u2019s number one global plastic polluter, followed by Nestl\u00e9 and Pepsico. Volunteers were able to select the locations for their clean-up efforts and so the final results may not be a perfect representation of global trends. Nonetheless, almost 12,000 Coca-Cola products were found in 37 countries across the world. There were some regional trends too. In the US, the biggest producers of plastic pollution were Nestl\u00e9, followed by Solo Cup Company and Starbucks. In Europe, Heineken was the third-largest plastic polluter. Volunteers found more than 59,000 plastic bags, 53,000 sachets and 29,000 plastic bottles. No one really knows how long plastics will take to decompose in our oceans but estimates suggest that it takes up to 450 years for a plastic bottle to break down. \u201cAny time our packaging ends up in our oceans \u2013 or anywhere that it doesn\u2019t belong \u2013 is unacceptable to us,\u201d Coca-Cola said in a statement to the Intercept. \u201cIn partnership with others, we are working to address this critical global issue, both to help turn off the tap in terms of plastic waste entering our oceans and to help clean up the existing pollution.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
