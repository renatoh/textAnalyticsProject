I had only expected to stay in Arusha for another day or so, but I ended up having a very pleasant reason to stay on with a bit of luxury thrown in. Before my safari trip, I had met a handsome Australian geologist who had just finished working at a gold mine in Tanzania. He provided nice dinners, good wine and intelligent conversation all of which have been lacking so far on my trip. We went our separate ways, him up Mount Meru and me on safari, but we met up again and I postponed my trip to Uganda in the name of a little travelling romance. Arusha suddenly went from the dusty and unwelcoming city of my first impressions to a warm, romantic spot with spectacular views. We also met a lovely lady called Val who at only a few years away from retirement, splits her year between seasonal work in Great Yarmouth and four months travel in Asia or Africa. Now that's what I call a retirement plan. The geologist was planning to climb Kilimanjaro (the lengths some men will go to get away from me). As I had only seen the mega mountain in passing, I decided to go and see what all the fuss was about. Val, the man and I braved a local mini-bus and headed out to Moshi for the day. In addition to the occasional public buses here, they run a herd of knackered old mini-buses with no capacity limit and a dubious safety record. What an experience - just when you think that it's not possible to get one more not-so-fragrant armpit in there, you're pushed, shoved and squeezed as another two Masai tribesmen, three children and an elderly lady with a walking stick sit on your lap. Please note, with my lack of fitness and serious smoking habit, nothing would make me climb the 5895m to Uhuru peak, but there seem to be plenty of nutters up for it. I plumped for a \"gentle hike\" to a waterfall at the base of Kilimanjaro. After a steep walk downhill, we reached a beautiful spot, completely secluded and surrounded with foliage with the sparkling Ndororo waterfall as its centre piece. The geologist dived in and did the macho swimming thing under the cold water filtered down the mighty mountain. I sat on a rock and paddled preparing for the uphill walk back. My lack of fitness was well and truly proven when we attempted to climb back up from the falls, I could only feign view appreciation for two of the stops. For the other five I had to admit, in between hyperventilating, that I was very unfit, much to the amusement of our sprightly 24-year-old guide. Three days later and I'm still having trouble walking! It was all worth it for the views and meeting the local schoolchildren en route who were fascinated by seeing their own pictures on my digital camera. I said my goodbyes to the geologist and Val and headed back to Arusha for my last night before the 15-hour journey to Kampala, capital of Uganda. I didn't expect to be sad to leave Tanzania, but I'd made some friends in Arusha. Cris and Bobbe, the guys working for the safari company, would often stop for a chat and were always helping me out with directions, contacts and advice. There's a warmth and kindness to the Tanzanian people that, if you get over the typical British expectation that everyone's out for something, makes a world of difference. I left Arusha with an invitation to go back for Christmas, and perhaps I will. The bus journey to Kampala was less eventful than my previous one. The bus company's trust in God paid off this time as we travelled easily through three countries in one night. The border crossings though were confusing and intimidating. Travelling this route overnight has some serious disadvantages. You're shoved off a bus and sent in the direction of a basic building with three yawning officials stamping passports. You then have to battle your way in pitch black darkness to walk across no man's land to Kenya. Another yawning official relieves you of $20 for the privilege of travelling through Kenya and you stumble, again in pitch darkness, through some very dodgy characters back to the relative safety of the bus. A short stop in Nairobi which at first glance seems to live up to its pet name \"Nairobbery\" and we had to do it all over again at 5am at the Ugandan border. I'll be eternally grateful to Andrew and Henry (two journalists from Kampala) who escorted me through the black market currency dealers and across the seriously scary no man's land patches. Arriving on Sunday morning in Kampala all I wanted was a shower and sleep. Once I was fully recovered, Andrew and Henry came to pick me up for my orientation tour of Kampala. We went for a walk and then to one of the many bars in the city to watch British football. Just an average Sunday afternoon then."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
