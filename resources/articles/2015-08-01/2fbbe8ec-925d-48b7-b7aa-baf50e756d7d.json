Utley is moving to Dodger Stadium in exchange for two minor leaguers. The deal comes a day after Phillies general manager Ruben Amaro said Utley was likely to stay in Philadelphia for the remainder of the season. Utley, 36, is batting .217 but is 15 for 31 since returning from a right ankle injury. He was not in Philadelphia\u2019s starting lineup for the Phillies\u2019 game against the Blue Jays at Citizens Bank Park on Wednesday night. Utley, who grew up in Long Beach, California, has full no-trade protection and reportedly expressed his preference to play in Los Angeles. Reports linked Utley to the Dodgers, the Los Angeles Angels and the Chicago Cubs at various times. The Dodgers will receive $2m from Philadelphia to offset the $6m remaining on Utley\u2019s $15m salary. He will be a free agent in November. Utley is set to be reunited with longtime double-play partner Jimmy Rollins. The Dodgers\u2019 regular second baseman, Howie Kendrick, has been sidelined since 9 August with a hamstring strain. Kendrick is expected to be out until September."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
