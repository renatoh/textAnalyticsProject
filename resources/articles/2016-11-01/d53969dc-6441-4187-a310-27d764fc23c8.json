Piper was named best actress for her performance in Yerma at the Young Vic at the Evening Standard theatre awards on Sunday, now Britain\u2019s longest-running theatre awards having been established in 1955. There were also prizes for Glenn Close, Ralph Fiennes, Kenneth Branagh, John Malkovich and the Good Chance theatre company, which was set up in Calais by the young playwrights Joe Murphy and Joe Robertson. In less than two decades, Piper has gone from teenage pop sensation (Because We Want to, Honey to the Bee) to TV stardom as Doctor Who\u2019s assistant to one of the most exciting stage actors of her generation. Off stage, 2016 would seem to have been a tough year for Piper, garnering lots of tabloid headlines as she divorced her second husband, Laurence Fox, after eight years of marriage. On stage, the year has been a triumph with critics stunned by her brilliant performance in the Australian writer-director Simon Stone\u2019s loose adaptation of Federico Garcia Lorca\u2019s 1934 classic. The Guardian\u2019s Michael Billington said Piper gave \u201ca breathtakingly uninhibited performance\u201d as the play\u2019s protagonist; while Libby Purves in the Daily Mail said Piper was \u201cone of the most intense and exciting creatures on any stage\u201d. Judges for the Evening Standard awards agreed, naming her best actress from a shortlist that also included Noma Dumezweni, Helen McCrory and Sophie Melville. The award was presented in the memory of Natasha Richardson. Fiennes was named best actor for two separate stage performances: Richard III at the Almeida and Ibsen\u2019s The Master Builder at the Old Vic. His competition was from Ian McKellen, Kenneth Branagh, James McArdle and OT Fagbenie. In total, 13 awards were given out at a starry, black-tie ceremony held at London\u2019s Old Vic theatre. The editor\u2019s award went to two men, Murphy and Robertson, who set up a theatre in the most unlikely of places, Calais\u2019s grim, desperate and now dismantled migrant camp. The camp may have gone, but the Good Chance theatre company, created by the two men, has said it will \u201ccontinue to build temporary theatres of hope\u201d. Presenting the award, actor Mark Rylance said Good Chance represented the best in us, particularly \u201cin these dark times when hate and fear of the other seem to becoming government policy.\u201d There was success for one of 2016\u2019s most talked about theatre events, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. The two-part play, written by Jack Thorne and based on an original story by JK Rowling, Thorne and John Tiffany, won the award for best new play. The best musical performance award went to Close for her barnstorming Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard at the London Coliseum. The limited run was Close\u2019s West End debut and a reprise of a role she first tackled in 1994, for which she won a Tony. She is due to play the faded Hollywood star once more when it goes to Broadway next February, a move that will mean Andrew Lloyd Webber will have four shows in New York: Sunset Boulevard, Cats, Phantom of the Opera and School of Rock. There was even more good news for Lloyd Webber at Sunday\u2019s awards when the Regent\u2019s Park Open Air theatre production of his show Jesus Christ Superstar won the only award voted for by the public, the Evening Standard and Radio 2 audience award for best musical. Tyrone Huntley, a memorable, powerful Judas in the production, won the emerging talent award. It was presented by Sir Elton John. Lloyd Webber joked that it had taken 45 years for the show to win a prize. He accepted with a message for Theresa May. \u201cPrime minister, if you are listening, can I passionately beg that you must stop cutting the arts in schools.\u201d He was echoing earlier remarks made by Patrick Stewart, who said he was the product of a secondary modern education. \u201cLet my story be an example to the prime minister ... your elitist, two-tier secondary school policies won\u2019t keep all underprivileged and therefore undeserving working class scum at the bottom of the heap. Some of us will have the impertinence to have ambition.\u201d Malkovich won the award for best director for his production of Good Canary by Zach Helm, a play he first directed in Paris in 2007. Staged at the Rose in Kingston, it was Malkovich\u2019s London debut as a stage director. The other awards included Sean Mathias\u2019s production of Harold Pinter\u2019s No Man\u2019s Land, starring McKellen and Stewart, which won best revival; Gareth Fry and Pete Malkin won best design for The Encounter, which transferred to the Barbican from Edinburgh; and Charlene James won the Charles Wintour award for most promising playwright for her exploration of FGM in her play Cuttin\u2019 It. The first award of the evening was presented by Prince William, giving the beyond theatre award to Sir David Attenborough for \u201chis outstanding contribution to broadcasting\u201d. Another knight, Sir Kenneth Branagh, was presented with an award in the name of the Evening Standard owner Evgeny Lebedev for his year-long residency at the Garrick theatre.
