Nowadays, perhaps, we are more likely to be struck by its untypical style rather than its size. Much of Reger's music aims to reconcile post-Wagnerian chromaticism with a classical austerity that peers back through Brahms to Bach. In this instance, however, both the harmonic palette and underlying severity are less extreme than usual, and we are left with a big post-Romantic concerto that occasionally sounds too Brahmsian to be considered wholly original. On its own terms, however, it's remarkably beautiful, and Tanja Becker-Bender does some wonderful things with it, shaping its lines with great lyrical force and a tremendous sense of drama. There's strong playing from the Konzerthausorchester Berlin under Lothar Zagrosek, too. The fillers, nicely done, are the two Romances, dating from 1900, widely regarded as trial runs for the Concerto, though they don't by any means equal its intensity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
