Commander Ali Dizaei falsely arrested the man, claiming he had threatened him and stabbed him with the end of a shisha pipe during a scuffle, Southwark crown court in London was told. But a medical examiner had concluded that the injuries suffered by the officer were more likely to have been self inflicted. Dizaei, 47, is one of Britain's most senior ethnic minority police officers and former president of the National Black Police Association. He is charged with threatening and falsely arresting Waad al-Baghdadi, who claimed Dizaei had failed to pay him for a website he had designed for him. The crown claims that the \u00a3600 Dizaei failed to pay al-Baghdadi led to months of rising tension, which spilled over in July 2008 into verbal and physical clashes outside a west London restaurant. Peter Wright QC told the jury that Dizaei was on trial for falsely claiming that al-Baghdadi had made threatening gestures and had assaulted the Met commander. Dizaei arrested the man, called 999 for help, and maintained his false account both at the scene and after al-Baghdadi was in custody by making false verbal and written statements, Wright alleged. He said the officer's account was contradicted by a 999 call al-Baghdadi made to police, during which time Dizaei arrested him. The crown said its case was supported by CCTV and other evidence. Dizaei denies misconduct in public office and intending to pervert the course of justice. Wright told the jury: \"These are allegations, we say, that involve the wholesale abuse of power by a senior police officer for entirely personal and oblique motives.\" The clash for which the officer is on trial began on 18 July 2008. Dizaei was in his police uniform having been at a Scotland Yard function earlier in the evening. Wright said that Dizaei had been sitting outside the Yas restaurant in a car with his wife when al-Baghdadi came over. Wright alleged that a row soon broke out, with Dizaei challenging the man to a fight in a nearby road, out of public sight. Wright said al-Baghdadi went into the restaurant to calm the situation down and to get a meal. The owner told him it may be best if he left. Dizaei re-entered the restaurant \"to throw his weight around\", the crown alleged. Wright said the officer told al-Baghdadi: \"You have five minutes to leave the restaurant otherwise I'll show you.\" The officer left, and al-Baghdadi stayed, but left after another appeal by the owner. As he walked towards his car, which was parked nearby, al-Baghdadi said Dizaei drove up in a police vehicle. The prosecution says the officer had his handcuffs and police utility belt on him. Dizaei says al-Baghdadi made threatening gestures towards him, and he arrested him for a public order offence. He claims during the arrest he was poked or stabbed in the stomach with an object which he believed to be the top of a shisha pipe. During the arrest, the crown claims Dizaei threatened al-Baghdadi, saying: \"I'll fuck your life \u2026 you think I don't know what you do in London \u2026 I'll find every single detail of your life in London.\" The crown says that as al-Baghdadi left the restaurant he called the police operator. The jury was played extracts of the eight-minute recording which the prosecution says disproves Dizaei's account. Al-Baghdadi says: \"He is a big police officer \u2026 he is threatening me for nothing.\" After several minutes Dizaei is heard speaking to the emergency operator on al-Baghdadi's phone, and asks for officers to be sent to assist him in his arrest. Three minutes later, Dizaei called 999, saying: \"Urgent assistance required, I've made an arrest.\" Wright said in the background al-Baghdadi can be heard saying: \"Let my hand go, you're breaking my hand.\" Within minutes police arrived and al-Baghdadi is taken to a police station where he was held for nearly 24 hours. In a written account Dizaei said that during the struggle \"I felt a sharp object in my stomach \u2026 which looked like a knife\". Later, al-Baghdadi's keys were found to have the top of a shisha pipe attached. Dizaei was examined by a forensic examiner, who found the injuries were more likely to be \"self-inflicted\". The case continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
