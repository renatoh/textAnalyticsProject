But you will almost certainly have eaten its produce. Bomfords supplies more than 50% of the big supermarkets' spring onions, and more than a quarter of their green beans and fresh peas. Its biggest customer, which takes about three-quarters of its produce, is Tesco. So Bomfords' fate affects many of us. It has just gone bust. Its collapse is a cautionary tale of the real cost of low prices. It exposes how the soaring profits of the major supermarkets have been built on illegality. The administrators have been called into Bomfords hard on the heels of investigating officers from the new Gangmasters Licensing Authority. The GLA inspected its sites in Worcestershire in March. The company, which has a turnover of \u00a3150m a year and employs more than 2,000 people at the height of the season - the majority migrants who pick and pack its vegetables - was recruiting its temporary staff through seven agencies. Each of those agencies was found to be breaking the law and had its licence revoked. Some of the Poles employed by one of the agencies were in such fear that the GLA revoked its gangmaster's licence on the spot. It had been common knowledge for years in the industry that Bomfords offered gangmasters hourly rates for workers that made it all but certain that those gangmasters would be breaking the law. The minimum hourly wage increased to \u00a35.35 last October. At that rate, a gangmaster who satisfies the law on minimum wage, national insurance and holiday and sick pay would charge at the very least \u00a36.27 per worker an hour. The industry's Association of Labour Providers (ALP) reported that Bomfords was paying some gangmasters just \u00a36.10 per hour this year. Last year it paid even less, with rates around \u00a35.50 in December, the ALP says. If you factor in a gangmaster's administration and overhead costs, the minimum rate is near \u00a37. That's before any profit. The ALP first drew the Inland Revenue's attention to Bomfords' rates and how far adrift they were from these indicative rates in April 2005. In the same month it also warned Tesco, it says. It adds that companies paying consistently below the indicative rate are knowingly or recklessly conniving in illegality. Tesco says it has no record of a specific warning from the ALP. After the GLA inspection, Bomfords employed more workers directly and had to pay significantly higher rates. A few months later, it is bust. It is said to owe growers, including farmers in Africa, about \u00a318m. For any company with tight finances, an extra wage bill would have a significant impact on cashflow that could tip it over. Bomfords had substantial debt. It had made two expensive acquisitions of rival supermarket suppliers. Like others facing the buying power of a handful of dominant retailers who have relentlessly kept down the prices they pay to suppliers, it was consolidating to try to strengthen its position. It was building a giant new packhouse where it could meet all the supermarket specifications, which involved vast capital investment - a project whose costs spiralled out of control. And then suddenly the wage bill went up. Soon the economics of supplying the supermarkets stopped working for it. One of the reasons it was able to supply vegetables more cheaply than others, and the supermarkets in turn were able to sell them more cheaply, was that it didn't pay as much for its labour as others. In other words, the business model of cheap fresh food which the big supermarkets have used to establish their dominance has depended on illegality. The response of the supermarkets to the GLA's findings was the usual, to express shock and promise to investigate. Yet as members of the Ethical Trading Initiative they make a commitment to audit their supply chains for conditions of labour. Anyone who bothered to look at Bomfords' rates would have seen that it was highly likely there was illegality along the line. How could Tesco, Bomfords' major customer, not have known about the problem? Tesco says it audited after the GLA operation and took action on any \"non-conformities\". Deloitte, the administrators who hope to sell Bomfords to other supermarket suppliers, says the difficulties arise from Bomfords' debts, overspend on the new packhouse, and problems integrating newly acquired businesses, but not from having to pay more for labour; the GLA findings are in the past as far as Deloitte is concerned. Tesco and Asda, which takes about a fifth of Bomfords' produce, say the same, that Bomfords' financial problems had other causes. \"There is no suggestion that excessive wage bills or cashflow problems caused by Bomfords' customers were a contributing factor,\" says Tesco. It would say that. But the ugly questions raised by Bomfords' demise will not go away. In its history we can see a supermarket system laid bare: a system capable on the one hand of checking that every last asparagus tip conforms to an exact size and shape, and tracking when, where and by whom it was packed; yet on the other, unable to spot that every gangmaster sending workers to a major supplier is breaking the law. felicity.lawrence@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
