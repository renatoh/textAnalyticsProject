The only thing that alerts us to its modernity is its new racial awareness. For the first time, the Disney corporation has given us a princess who is black. Or \u2026 have they? Tiana, voiced by Anika Noni Rose, is an African-American girl who once dreamed of kissing frogs to find her true prince. Now she's a hard-working young woman in New Orleans who dreams of opening a restaurant. A visiting aristocrat, Prince Naveen, voiced by Bruno Campos, is turned into a frog by a voodoo trickster and when Tiana kisses him \u2013 yikes! \u2013 she turns into a frog, too. So these avowedly black people spend an awful lot of the movie being adorable, unthreatening little green creatures. Disney may wish to reach out to people of colour \u2013 but the colour green wasn't what we had in mind. It's a moderate film, nowhere near the Toy Story league."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
