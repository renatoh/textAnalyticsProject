It is a sort of intimate, episodic saga, following the ups and downs of Robert, a taxi driver played by Jacques Gamblin, his wife Marie-Jeanne (Zabou Breitman) and their three children as they develop from teens into grownups. The youngsters cope with the challenge of being adults, the parents with the challenge of the looming empty nest. The conceit is that the movie will dramatise five key days in their group history - although the rigour of this approach is undermined with flashbacks. Reasonable enough, but underpowered."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
