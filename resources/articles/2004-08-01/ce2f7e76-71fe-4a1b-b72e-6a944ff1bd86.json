Durrell included his own \"free\" translations of \"The City\" and several other Cavafy poems in his Alexandria Quartet. The popularity of the Quartet may have helped create a favourable market for later translations of Cavafy's poems. Griff Everett Milford, Derbyshire Duncan Sprott asks \"What do we have left of Cavafy in translation?\" One recent interpretation is Leonard Cohen's \"Alexandra Leaving\" (on the 2001 album Ten New Songs ), based on Cavafy's poem \"The God Forsakes Antony\", in which Cohen adapts Marcus Antonius's loss of his beloved city of Alexandria into a man's loss of a woman. Richard Cooper Twickenham Mistaken identity Tim Ashley (\"Evil genius\", August 14) attributes to Auden the couplet \"Time will pardon Paul Claudel, / Pardon him for writing well.\" This not only misquotes the original (from Auden's \"In memory of WB Yeats\"), but misunderstands what Auden is saying. The correct quotation is: \"Time that with this strange excuse / Pardoned Kipling and his views, / And will pardon Paul Claudel, / Pardons him for writing well\" - the him being Yeats. Alan Robinson by email Chopsticks galore It is a pity to split hairs over Kevin Rushby's enthusiastic review of The Life of William Dampier (\"Pirate treasure\", August 14). Dampier's was not the first English description of chopsticks, though his may be the earliest first-hand account in English. Almost 100 years earlier, Gaspar da Cruz's experiences of China were published in English. His account of 1569 spoke of \"two small sticks very fine and gilt, to eat with... they use them like a pair of pincers\". Da Cruz's experiences were subsequently described by Juan Mendoza in an influential book published in English in 1588. Keith Leaver Hitchin, Herts Plagued by doubts Simon Wessely (\"A plague on all your houses\", August 14) is very dismissive of those of us who question the identification of the so-called Black Death with plague. Bubonic plague is caused by a bacillus in fleas; normally the flea only transfers to humans when all rats are dead; moreover, bubonic plague is not easily transmitted by human to human contact as the bacillus must enter the body via a lesion. The 14th-century pandemic known as the Black Death spread in two years from Sicily to Greenland; there are no contemporary records of huge numbers of dead rats. This pretty well rules out the bubonic plague hypothesis as Dr Twigg demonstrated in 1984. Pneumonic plague is easily spread by sneezing and coughing but is held to be too rapid a killer to have been responsible for the 14th-century pandemic - the spread of an infectious disease requires living carriers. We can only conclude that we do not know, and possibly never will, what the Black Death was.
