There were scones with butter, rugby trophies proudly on display, and on the wall, someone from the club had put up a tino rangatiratanga \u2013 or Indigenous M\u0101ori sovereignty \u2013 flag (it turned out to be upside down, something the rugby club say they were responsible for). Todd Muller\u2019s launch last Sunday was not flashy or digital; in one sense it was politics of the old school. But for those who listened to the long, nuanced speech, Muller cited both National party prime ministers \u2013 from his own, centre-right group \u2013 and those from Ardern\u2019s centre-left Labour, as chief among his influences. Mild-mannered but at times intense, occasionally visibly nervous, Muller spoke of his discontent at the plight of what he called New Zealand\u2019s \u201cunderclass\u201d and pledged that while his more conservative party would not increase taxes, he would not cut welfare either. \u201cI\u2019ve a strong belief that there are some of these things where actually we should see successive governments and political parties building on legacies as opposed to trying to tear them down,\u201d he told the Guardian during an interview at his parliamentary offices in Wellington. \u201cI\u2019ve never been hugely struck by labels, actually. I\u2019ve been massively impacted by what works.\u201d It\u2019s the sort of talk that has lawmakers from across the political spectrum praising Muller\u2019s \u201cdecency\u201d. His work at parliament included negotiating with the left-leaning Greens on a bill to enshrine New Zealand\u2019s carbon emissions targets in law. But his approach also poses a challenge for a relative political unknown who is taking on the most popular New Zealand prime minister of modern times at an election in just over three months: he needs to make an impact. It has only been a few weeks since Muller, a father of three, took up leadership of his party after ousting his predecessor. Ardern is riding high despite problems with her government\u2019s Covid-19 border measures; in a poll published the day before Muller assumed the National leadership in May, his party had a woeful 29% support. Ardern\u2019s Labour held 59%. Following the prime minister\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 outbreak, a terrorist attack, and a volcanic eruption she is one of the best-known and most popular politicians in the world, her face painted on buildings in other countries and talk circulating of a Nobel peace prize. \u201cI\u2019m not going to attack for attack\u2019s sake,\u201d says Muller, who was elected to parliament in 2014. \u201cI think you look for points of difference that are critical ... But I don\u2019t think they\u2019re all the time, every day on every issue.\u201d He doesn\u2019t bother much with Twitter; his Facebook page has just over 30,000 fans compared to Ardern\u2019s 1.3 million. But he says he can only campaign as himself and he believes that if he can meet enough people one-on-one he might win them over, even though he admits they might be thinking \u201cWho\u2019s this guy?\u2019. \u201cThe greatest energy I get in the role is actually being out and connecting with people,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause the election creates that sort of crucible ... I think that\u2019s going to provide the opportunity for people to see me and connect with me and make judgments as to whether they find me an authentic person or not.\u201d As well as an in-person campaign strategy, Muller expects something else: that the tide will turn on Ardern\u2019s government, which has been credited with saving New Zealand from the worst possible outcomes of the Covid-19 pandemic, but is now staring down a recession in the lead-up to September\u2019s vote. \u201cIt is changing rapidly out there,\u201d he says, referring to the mood of the country. \u201cI have every sense that when we get to August, September, the economy will be in a far more stressed situation than it is now.\u201d He was not \u201cwilling the badness\u201d, he says. \u201cThat is just what is predicted to happen.\u201d In the past, National has sold itself as the party of good fiscal management, although polls show Ardern\u2019s party is currently trusted with the country\u2019s books. Muller has touted his business background \u2013 he held top roles at Zespri, the world\u2019s largest kiwifruit marketer, and the dairy giant Fonterra \u2013 as evidence he is prepared to take over. But before he was a business leader, Muller wanted a career in politics. The Te Puna rugby clubrooms where he delivered his speech are just down the road from where he grew up near the city of Tauranga in New Zealand\u2019s Bay of Plenty, and where his grandfather, even into his 70s, would hear sirens and \u201cjump in the car and try and follow the fire engine with a thermos and rugs and stuff\u201d. It had an impact on Muller, who recalled seeing his grandfather at 90 with \u201ca huge sense of deep satisfaction of a life well lived in terms of service and faith and family and how deeply empowering it was in terms of a life of purpose\u201d. The family were Catholic; Muller describes faith and \u201cmy personally clumsy attempt to understand it\u201d as \u201cmy own personal journey\u201d. He votes conservatively on social issues: against abortion and voluntary euthanasia, most recently. \u201cI don\u2019t and will never seek to suggest to anybody else that my life journey is a journey that they must follow,\u201d he says. He was a rare conservative student politician at left-leaning Waikato university, and wound up working for the former National party prime minister, Jim Bolger. He was already dreaming of holding office himself but wanted some experience away from politics first. Muller\u2019s scholarship of American politics has at times proved controversial; when he took over the National party leadership, photos taken of his office in 2019 showed a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat on a shelf. After trying to dismiss suggestions he should abandon such a divisive symbol \u2013 Muller tried to argue that he had also displayed two Hillary Clinton pins \u2013 he eventually conceded that the hat would not accompany him to the opposition leader\u2019s office. Surely it was naive to assume the hat would prove uncontroversial, particularly after a white supremacist massacre of Muslims in Christchurch last year? \u201cMy headspace was completely elsewhere, right? I had just become the leader of the opposition,\u201d Muller says. \u201cI totally understand that for some people it is a deeply oppressive symbol, but I wasn\u2019t looking at it through that lens.\u201d But the student of American politics fears that country\u2019s political \u201cpartisanship\u201d could become \u201ca contagion\u201d elsewhere, including in New Zealand. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to hold on to that great New Zealand capacity to be able to have tough conversations, but respectfully and totally acknowledge the fact that 5,000 people wanted to show and demonstration of their solidarity to the importance of calling racism out when they see it,\u201d he says, referring to the Black Lives Matter protests held in New Zealand\u2019s major cities. Race has, in an uneven first month, occasionally proved troublesome for Muller; there was the MAGA hat, the upside-down M\u0101ori flag, and criticism that his front bench team does not feature any M\u0101ori or non-white MPs. It led to speculation that Muller did not have the deftness required on matters of race, or a modern enough outlook to combat Ardern. But Lain Jager, an old friend of Muller\u2019s from university, says that isn\u2019t true. Te Puna, where Muller grew up, Jager says, is interwoven with the M\u0101ori world; visiting Muller\u2019s family on their kiwifruit orchard, he saw people \u201cvery closely networked into the local community, including the M\u0101ori community\u201d. \u201cAnyone who says that Todd doesn\u2019t have a relationship with M\u0101ori and isn\u2019t grounded in a deeply M\u0101ori community in Te Puna, just doesn\u2019t know Te Puna and doesn\u2019t know Todd,\u201d he added. Muller has seemed at times nervous in his first month, occasionally unprepared for a tough question. But on Wednesday, as the extent of New Zealand\u2019s border woes in the Covid-19 crisis deepened, Muller finally took full flight during parliamentary question time. One hand in his pocket, and without the stumbles that have characterised his earlier statements, he slammed the government\u2019s \u201cappalling, shambolic\u201d response. \u201cOf course I would vote for Todd,\u201d says Jager, his friend. \u201cBut my view is we\u2019re blessed in New Zealand. Jacinda Ardern is a tremendous person and politician, Todd Muller is a tremendous person and politician. I think New Zealanders have genuine choice on how they vote.\u201d Such a view might be one of Muller\u2019s biggest obstacles. But the opposition leader says that no matter how things looked for his party in the polls as the election loomed, voters would not find him starting fights, or \u201cdown in the weeds of vitriol\u201d on Twitter. \u201cIf that is the test of leadership, then I will not meet it,\u201d Muller says. \u201cThat\u2019s just not who I am.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
