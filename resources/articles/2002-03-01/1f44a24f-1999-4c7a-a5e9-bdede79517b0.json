The British No1's efforts in reaching the second Masters Series final of his career suggest he could still deliver on his promise. Henman's talent and work ethic were never in question but in recent years his career has been on a plateau, albeit one in or around the world's top 10, and his rapid rise up the rankings five years ago, when he was still a relative rookie on the tour, indicated he is capable of much more. Only since hiring his American coach Larry Stefanki last July has Henman's game begun to improve and evolve at the rate it did during the early years of his career. Stefanki's handiwork is seen in all areas of Henman's game, notably on the serve, which has so often in the past proved an achilles heel. Henman admits he is still a work in progress, though, and Hewitt proved that there are times when just getting the ball in play is not enough. \"I think the thing that is coming soon is probably a more aggressive serve,\" said Henman. \"I feel like the balance of going for it and getting the percentage right is getting better and better.\" Stefanki's most important contribution may be to Henman's brain: he now thinks his way into the net rather than charging hell for leather, and seems to have a better idea of what his strengths are and how to use them. All Stefanki has to do now is make sure Henman does not let thinking get too much in the way. Even when he is not nervous he appears to approach serving for sets and matches with trepidation, worrying himself into trouble when he should be applying the thumbscrews. \"Larry's attitude is that I should almost be a little more arrogant, a little cockier about it,\" said Henman. He did not get much chance against Hewitt but then the world No1 is probably cocky enough for both of them, and has every right to be given the gulf in class on Sunday. First on Henman and Stefanki's to-do list will be maintaining his current streak of good form in Miami this week at the Nasdaq-100 Open. The event is the second consecutive Masters Series tournament and offers more points and prize money than Indian Wells. If Henman can manage to win a few rounds there, and prove last week was part of an upward curve, then there really will be grounds for optimism. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
