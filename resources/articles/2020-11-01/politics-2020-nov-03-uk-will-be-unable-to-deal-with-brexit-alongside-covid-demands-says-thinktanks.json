Local councils, trading standards officers and port health authorities are all part of the Brexit operation but may find themselves stretched because of the resurgence of the virus, the Institute for Government said. \u201cThe pandemic will make these plans harder. For example, critical staff may fall ill or need to isolate and resources may well be redirected to the pandemic response. \u201cAnd although central government has managed to shift resources back to Brexit preparations after they were redeployed to help with the pandemic earlier this year, there is less capacity among the devolved governments and local authorities to handle both,\u201d says report titled Brexit: How Ready is the UK? While the UK faces a challenging winter, cooperation with local administrations will be more critical than ever not least to understand how the double shock of Covid and Brexit is playing out in key areas including ports, airports and key industries that rely on cross-border supply chains or workforces. The report comes a day after the National Institute for Economic and Social Research warned that Brexit \u201con top of Covid-19 is likely to broaden the shock to growth and employment in the first quarter of 2021, weakening the UK\u2019s recovery compared with other countries, and reducing productivity in the long run\u201d. Authors of the IfG report commend the government on getting most of the required legislation including the new immigration and agriculture bills through by the end of the year. But questions remain. With less than 60 days to go, the government has yet to announce how the UK prosperity fund will work, how it will replace EU funding whether for science or economic development, says the report. It also predicts that the Northern Ireland protocol cannot be implement in full on time with the IT systems and infrastructure for new border control posts not ready for 1 January. This will present the government with a challenge to apply the \u201cthe letter\u201d of the withdrawal agreement and risk lorry queues in ports such as Liverpool or facilitate the flow of goods without the new regulatory and customs checks in place and risk ending up in the European court of justice. While trust between the EU and the UK has been badly damaged over Boris Johnson\u2019s threat to \u201cdisapply\u201d some of the withdrawal agreement, the IfG believes if the offending clauses in the internal market bill are dropped, the EU should \u201cbe ready to show some flexibility\u201d on the Northern Ireland protocol. On border readiness elsewhere in the country, the IfG says \u201cmore work is needed\u201d to help business prepare for the new controls which many do not realise apply whether there is a trade deal or not. \u201cThe economic damage wrought by coronavirus has robbed many of the bandwidth, and cash, to do what is needed,\u201d it says adding that as recently as late October one third of small businesses were still labouring under the illusion that the transition period would be extended beyond 31 December. It also criticised the government\u2019s communications campaign as concentrating on the opportunities of Brexit rather than making a call to action for businesses. And it warns that while Whitehall may have the resources and separate work streams on Brexit, Westminster should not be complacent. \u201cEven if the UK civil service has the necessary resources to do so, the devolved administrations, local authorities and businesses may well be overwhelmed,\u201d it says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
