In December, Facebook deleted the social media accounts of Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of the Chechen Republic. The company told the New York Times that the deletions were due to the US government\u2019s imposition of economic sanctions on Kadyrov, but other world leaders named on US sanctions lists, such as the Venezuelan president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, and Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad, have not been banned from Facebook. Trump\u2019s frequent and reckless use of Twitter defined him as a presidential candidate, but has elicited increased concern since his inauguration. From the White House, Trump has continued his use of the platform to attack political opponents (and allies) and journalists, and also to threaten North Korea and share anti-Muslim videos posted by a leader of a far-right British hate group. Many Trump critics have called for the president to be banned from the website \u2013 both because his tweets can often be construed as violating the platform\u2019s rules and out of fear that his outbursts could actually spark a war. In August, the former CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson launched an unsuccessful effort to crowdfund the purchase of Twitter in order to ban Trump. In November, Trump\u2019s personal account was briefly deactivated. The company attributed the outage to the actions of a contractor on his final day of work, and the contractor later claimed that he had made a mistake. Some critics have suggested that Twitter\u2019s reluctance to censor Trump\u2019s Tweets stems from its understanding that Trump\u2019s predilection for the platform provides outsize importance to a company that has failed to achieve the popularity of social media behemoths such as Facebook and YouTube. But the company appeared to dismiss that criticism in the statement, writing: \u201cNo one person\u2019s account drives Twitter\u2019s growth, or influences these decisions.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
