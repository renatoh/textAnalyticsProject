As with all good presentations, advice was given by flipchart in a number of helpful bullet points, the first of which was the brilliantly thought-out 'Judge A Book By Its Cover' (numbers 2 and 3 were 'Put The Cart Before The Horse' and 'Count Your Chickens Before They Hatch'). It may be laughable, and contrary to everything that we might be supposed to value in a book (such as the words, for example), but the men from Smith's are not necessarily as fatuous as they first appear. Jacket design and presentation matter in the modern book market as they never have before. Publishers used to use jacket design to denote their own particular brand, in the way that Penguin still do with their Classics series. These days, though, jacket design is more likely to identify the genre than the publisher. We're all familiar with the gold embossed title that means you've picked up a thriller or a Hollywood romp, but to avoid any confusion, here's a quick guide to judging a book by its cover if you're in a hurry: 1. Girl in sunglasses grinning coquettishly up at a camera positioned somewhere above her head, usually against a fuchsia background. The author of any book with variations on this cover will be under 30, called Chelsea, Georgia, or any other name that might also be a location, and the novel will be set in west London with a heroine who works in the media, has a gay best friend and says 'whatever' with mind-numbing frequency. 2. Loveable urchin with sticking plaster on knee amusing itself with rudimentary plaything fashioned from piece of litter in alley between tenements. This is either an imaginatively heightened confessional memoir or a Celtic novel. Not always easy to tell the difference. 3. Still from film or television adaptation, usually involving period costume. This is what's known as a classic novel, meaning pre-Hornby, which the publisher suspects you are too dull-witted to pick up unless they sex it up with a picture of Greg Wise in tights. 4. Archaic map/clock/scientific diagram, always carrying the subtitle 'The true story of one man's quest to discover the [fill in blank] against all odds.' Post-Longitude narrative history charting the discovery of increasing obscure things no one remotely cares about. But don't be misled; the subtle art of judging a book by its cover is not limited to the picture on the front. The author photo and potted biography on the inside back flap are as telling as the graphic. In the old days, no one seemed to care what the author looked like. Now, if you pick up a book that doesn't have a picture of the author, your immediate assumption is that he or she must be so disturbing in appearance that an unwary browser would be horrified into dropping the book and fleeing the shop empty-handed. Conversely, if an author is female and under 50, her photo will aim to make her as alluring as possible to reinforce the fact that someone with cheekbones who can write a book clearly has a broader range of accomplishments than someone who's a bit fat and wears thick glasses. The only occasion when glasses are appropriate in an author photo is if you're a young woman writing on a serious subject such as genetics or war crimes, in which case you will want to appear intellectually weighty, yet convey the potential to whip off the glasses at any moment, loosen your hair and transform into a fox. Author biogs are the most accurate guide to the tone of what you are about to read. Be wary of any author who tries to be ironic and/or uses exclamation marks: 'John Mate lives in London and likes windsurfing and playing the guitar - though not at the same time!' Similarly, avoid the author who 'divides their time' - they are too rich and are just showing off. Note that they always 'divide their time' between New York and Provence, or west London and the British Virgin Islands. Never do you read of someone dividing their time between their flat in Camden and the Coach and Horses. There is also a particular kind of middle-brow women's writer who always ends her biog with 'Jane Bland lives in Oxfordshire with her husband, the film producer Nigel Bland.' No one ever boasts about living with their husband, the French teacher Nigel Bland or, perhaps, the greengrocer Nigel Bland. I hope this'll be of use as you dither in Smith's on your way to the departure gate. Judging books by their covers can be a timesaver, but so can watching the film version. Or you could go down the old-fashioned route of reading a few pages or even consulting a review. Have your say"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
