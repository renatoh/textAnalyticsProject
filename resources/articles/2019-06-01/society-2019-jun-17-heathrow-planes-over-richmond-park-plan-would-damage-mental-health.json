Heathrow will on Tuesday publish a consultation on its \u201cmaster plan\u201d for airport expansion, including environmental aspects of building a third runway. Expert evidence, which will be submitted to the consultation by the Friends of Richmond Park, said the effect of low flying aircraft directly over the park for the first time as a result of the expansion would be damaging to mental health. Dr Alison Greenwood\u2019s evidence comes days after research which showed a two-hour \u201cdose\u201d of nature a week significantly boosts health and wellbeing. Under the planned expansion of Heathrow hundreds of planes will fly at low altitude over the park \u2013 a national nature reserve \u2013 for the first time. Greenwood said the potential negative effects of increased noise pollution from low-flying aircraft on mental wellbeing were of great concern in a country where one in four people suffered a mental health problem each year. She said: \u201cWith over 91% of us living in urban environments, and studies showing a significant increase in anxiety and mood disorders among city dwellers, one might expect our government to be doing all it could to protect our valuable natural spaces. \u201cIt seems irrational then that the government is allowing Heathrow, as part of its plans for the third runway, to propose routing for the first time 47 low-flying arrivals as well as between 17 and 47 extra departures every hour directly over Richmond Park, London\u2019s largest open space, a national nature reserve and a site of special scientific interest.\u201d Greenwood said she treated patients with mental health problems who were referred to her by GPs, with doses of nature in the park. \u201cThe conclusion of hundreds of scientific studies comprehensively demonstrates the mental health benefits of exposure to nature,\u201d she said. \u201cI regularly walk or sit in Richmond Park with people suffering from all kinds of mental distress, and I see first hand the powerful healing qualities of being in such a magnificent natural setting.\u201d According to the World Health Organization, environmental noise features among the top environmental risks to physical and mental health and wellbeing. The WHO guidelines recommend reducing noise levels produced by aircraft to below 45 decibels (dB). \u201cAircraft noise above this level is associated with adverse health effects,\u201d it said. Under the Heathrow expansion plans, hundreds of planes would produce noise levels of up to 80dB \u2013 nearly eight times the WHO guidelines \u2013 flying at 1,500 feet over the park. Boris Johnson, the frontrunner to win the Conservative leadership, has suggested he would drop his longstanding opposition to a third runway at Heathrow if he becomes prime minister, according to the Times. The former mayor of London, who told his constituents he would \u201clie down with you in front of those bulldozers and \u2026 stop the construction of that third runway,\u201d refused to reassure campaigners against the runway earlier this week that he would cancel the scheme. The Heathrow airspace and future operations consultation, which follows MPs\u2019 approval of the third runway last year, indicates that 47 arrivals an hour and between 17 and 47 departures would fly directly over the park at below 900 metres. Heathrow\u2019s flights are currently capped at 480,000 a year, but it wants to increase this by 25,000 in 2021 and further when the third runway is built. The park was established by Kings Charles I as a hunting ground in the 17th century and stretches more than 1,000 hectares (2,471 acres). Sir David Attenborough, in a recent documentary on the park, said steps had to be taken to protect it against increased human activity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
