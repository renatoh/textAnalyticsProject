But, even with those trophies claimed in the buildup to this tournament, Wesley Sneijder will feel as if the world has been snatched away from him this morning. This contest drifted miserably towards a penalty shoot-out last night with the player who had hoped to illuminate the occasion struggling to impose himself. Sneijder has been Holland's spark in this tournament, a goalscorer and creator flitting into space behind Robin van Persie's fluid movement, but it was his temper that flared more readily here. The Dutch needed their player to be anything but flustered. Crowded out by opponents and isolated from his team-mates, he snarled through long periods distant from the play. It was not supposed to be like this. It had taken the 26-year-old some 17 minutes even to touch the ball with any real intent. A free-kick some 35 yards out hardly promised reward though, having endured life on the periphery for too long already, the midfielder chose to batter at goal rather than supply the muddle of team-mates in the centre with Iker Casillas catching the ambitious effort. Up to then there had been the odd misplaced pass and plenty of grumbling at Howard Webb. Nerves appeared to have set in when the Dutch needed calm authority. The anxiety was understandable. A little over a year ago, even an appearance on this stage would have felt distinctly improbable. Back then Sneijder was marginalised at Real Madrid with members of the Dutch management team seriously considering whether he should suffer the same treatment in their set-up given his outspoken approach and unerring ability to rile his team-mates. The tension with Van Persie in particular threatened to disrupt. The Arsenal striker referred to his team-mate as The Smurf. The nickname was not one of endearment. Yet a \u00a312m transfer to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's Internazionale revived his fortunes and the playmaker had not looked back. A glittering season in Italy culminated in that comfortable success over Arjen Robben's Bayern Munich in May, adding to the domestic haul. He had been set up to excel, arriving in South Africa at the pinnacle of his game, and had not disappointed with his goals, including a brace of headers against Brazil, had propelled the Dutch to a first final in 32 years. To think Sneijder might have gone ignored altogether feels remarkable now. Rather, he had been elevated to the status of this team's most pivotal performer. \"Now, with the national side, you can see that the rest of the team realise the importance of his role,\" said the former Holland midfielder Ronald Koeman, who had handed Sneijder his senior debut at Ajax as a skinny 18-year-old. \"Before, he was not always at the centre of things, playing more as a wide player in the European Championships two years ago, but now he is the key player to make the transition between midfield and attack.\" Holland needed him rejoicing in that role here rather than busying himself complaining at perceived injustice. He was penalised for backing into Sergio Busquets, then booked for crunching into the same player. For all his protests, he was fortunate not to become the sixth player to be cautioned in 27 fractious minutes at that stage. Yet the composure was draining. Each sloppy pass had him stewing even more in sudden inadequacy. This had veered from the script that had apparently been written for him. It might still have been clawed back. It was his fine challenge that checked Andres Iniesta's burst into the penalty area, and his swivel and wonderful pass inside Joan Capdevila and Busquets, filling in for Gerard Pique who was undergoing treatment on a blood injury, which sent Robben gliding through the centre for the clearest chance of the contest an hour in. The winger took his time before shooting only for Casillas to conjure a magnificent save with his outstretched right boot. Sneijder's weary and hopeless shot from just inside the Spanish half in stoppage time smacked of desperation. The consolation, if there was any to be had, was that Spain's most prolific player and a rival for the Golden Boot was also lost in the mishmash. David Villa had provided virtually all his side's bite in South Africa, scoring five of his team's seven goals en route back to Soccer City, to finish off their invariably slick and jaw-dropping approach play. Yet with Nigel de Jong and Mark van Bommel snapping away at Spain's midfield \u2013 rarely legitimately \u2013 the lone forward was thrust further into isolation. John Heitinga somehow stifled his best opportunity, recovering from his error at Jes\u00fas Navas's centre to block the striker's attempt from close-range. Other than that, the new \u00a334m Barcelona acquisition ran the channels with no hint of reward, praying that one of his team-mates could rouse themselves to supply a pass as glorious as Sneijder's. Robben had admited in the build-up to the final that the key to Holland's tactics was checking Xavi and Iniesta's invention. The consequence would be to suffocate Villa. He had been proved right. Yet this was no occasion for any player of flair. Creation was lost in brutal tackling and forgotten amid the flurry of yellow cards. Villa was withdrawn at half-time in extra-time with nothing at that stage to show for a night of toil. Sneijder, like the striker, had expected so much more than this."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
