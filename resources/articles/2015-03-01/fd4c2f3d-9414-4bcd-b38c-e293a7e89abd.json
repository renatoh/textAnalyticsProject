The Welsh singer credits the experience with teaching her how to write bigger, lusher songs, and she\u2019s applied that in spades to the entirely self-penned Froot. Diamandis\u2019s default setting is hyper-emotional anyway, so this has yielded a record of intense highs and lows, and a range of styles that don\u2019t always join up well. Opener Happy is delicate, dignified acoustica that has her emerging from a long bout of depression: \u201cI found what I\u2019ve been looking for in myself, found a life worth living.\u201d Then, disconcertingly, it\u2019s on to the title track\u2019s sugar-rush electro-giddiness, which offers the ooh-matron couplet \u201cBaby, I am plump and ripe / I\u2019m pinker than shepherd\u2019s delight.\u201d And so it goes, darting from Bat for Lashes-style spectral disco (I\u2019m a Ruin) to shoegazing balladry (Solitaire) via Taylor Swiftian bubbliness (Blue). Marina\u2019s whooping, swooping mannerisms add to the sense of dislocation \u2013 but if you allow yourself to be swept into her world, it\u2019s an intriguing place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
