It was a great honour to be considered for so important a task. I therefore accepted with alacrity, despite knowing full well that the solitary week I had for my own analysis would be hopelessly inadequate for the task. The monomachy took place in a lodge in a mountain retreat outside the Black Sea port of Yalta. There, amid the stuffed bears, wild boars and eagles, we exchanged blows with just an arbiter and an occasional spectator. Regular afternoon showers and a leaky ceiling meant that water sometimes dripped on to the board, but the combatants were not distracted by such trivialities. My opponent, a mere 19 years of age, stormed into an early lead. By the half-way stage I was 3.5-0.5 down and facing humiliation. Fortunately I rebounded in the fifth, when my opponent displayed uncharacteristic nervousness, and followed it up with another win. In the seventh I went a piece up for just two pawns. My king was exposed but with my opponent running out of firepower (only a queen and rook left), I had every reason to be optimistic. In time trouble, though, I blundered. Ruslan, with a few precise moves, took the game and the match. The eighth was one of the most fascinating in my career. After the most bizarre twists and turns and tactical motifs, I emerged victorious. Thus 4.5-3.5 was the final score. I had fought valiantly, but not well enough. For reasons that have never been adequately explained, Ponomariov's match with Kasparov was aborted and he was stripped of the title. Ruslan, in a recent interview, while stressing his youth at the time, hinted that he was manipulated by higher powers. It is hard to uncover the machinations of the \"plot\", because it is hard, if not impossible, to identify any potential beneficiary. It certainly wasn't Kasparov and probably not FIDE either. Anyway, this genial fellow, after a period of disillusionment, is back to doing what he does best: playing chess. Last week he notched up an impressive first place in Mexico. He seems like an old-hand, but at just 22, he has a long future ahead of him at the top. Ponomariov, R (2723) - Bruzon, L (2650), Young Masters, Cuernavaca, Mexico, 08.02.2006 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.Nc3 a6 4.d4 cxd4 5.Nxd4 b5 6.Bd3 Qb6 (A somewhat extravagant system, neglecting development, that has been in vogue of late. I doubt whether it will remain so for long.) 7.Nf3 Bb7 8.0-0 Nc6 9.a4 b4 10.a5! (An important intermezzo.) Qc7 (If 10...Nxa5 11.Na4 Qc7 12.Be3 Nc6 13.Nb6 is clearly in White's favour.) 11.Na4 Nf6 12.Be3 Be7 13.Bb6 Qb8 14.Qe2 0-0 15.Nc5 Bxc5 16.Bxc5 (White adds the bishop pair to his collection of advantages.)

With the b-pawn dropping off, the queenside collapses.) dxe4 23.fxe4 Bc6 24.Rxb4 Bb5 (An attempt at activity but merely accelerating the Cuban's demise.) 25.Qxc3 Rxc3 26.Bxb5 axb5 27.Rf2 (Threatening 28.Re2 and annexing the b-pawn. Should Black attempt to activate his a8 rook, White's passed a-pawn will advance towards coronation.) Black resigns."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
