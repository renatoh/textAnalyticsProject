Ken Barrett, 41, was one of a team of masked gunmen who broke into Finucane's house and shot him 14 times while he was eating a Sunday meal with his family in February 1989. It was one of the most controversial murders of Northern Ireland's 30-year troubles and an investigation by Sir John Stevens, the Metropolitan police commissioner, confirmed intelligence agencies and police had collaborated with the killers. But Barrett, a former loyalist paramilitary turned intelligence agent, who dramatically changed his plea to guilty at the start of his trial at Belfast crown court this week, could be freed within months under the Good Friday agreement. Although provisions are in place to move him from a jail in Northern Ireland to Britain, he is likely to apply for review of his sentence and could be released in May. Tony Blair faced renewed nationalist demands for a public inquiry into the state's role in the assassination yesterday when he held talks to rescue the peace process with Northern Ireland's political parties at Leeds Castle in Kent. Finucane was a prominent lawyer who had represented republican as well as Protestant clients. Peter Cory, a retired Canadian judge, was appointed by the government in 2001 to investigate the case. He found documentary proof that MI5, the army and special branch knew about a plot to kill Finucane and failed to act. But when the judge recommended a public inquiry almost a year ago the government postponed any action until all criminal proceedings had been exhausted, saying Barrett's trial could be prejudiced. The Finucane family and nationalist politicians said yesterday it was time for the government to honour its commitment to an inquiry. Finucane's brother, Martin, said: \"We demand a public inquiry, nothing else will satisfy us. It is now up to Tony Blair to take action.\" Finucane's widow, Geraldine, has already launched a legal challenge to the government's decision to delay a public inquiry. Barrett, who also admitted 12 other charges including membership of the Ulster Freedom Fighters, stealing army weapons, and attempted murder, is the first person to be charged with the killing. Sentencing him at Belfast crown court, Mr Justice Weir said he had shown no remorse, just \"boastful expressions of self-satisfaction\". Sinn F\u00e9in has accused the government of using the Barrett trial and criminal investigations as an excuse for a cover-up of the \"murky underbelly\" of state collusion with loyalist paramilitaries. Gerry Adams, the party's leader, said: \"The British government has made a commitment to have a public inquiry and they have since broken that commitment. \"It remains a broken commitment.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
