The Scot, livid that Stam had embarrassed him in a warts-and-all autobiography, ordered the board to set up a \u00a316.5m deal with Lazio and replaced him with Laurent Blanc. Stam promptly failed a drug test, United lost the title - and the central defender is now seeking a move, claiming he has not been paid since Christmas. Paul Ince Sold to Inter for \u00a37m, aged 27, June 1995 Ferguson can still remember the amazement when he told the board he wanted to sell the 'big-time Charlie' with the number-plate Guv 1. He blamed Ince for Everton's goal when United lost the Cup final: 'He should have left that Guv'nor stuff in his toy box.' After two years in Serie A Ince moved to Liverpool, incurring a caustic reception every time he returns to Old Trafford. Now considering a last year in the top flight with Wolves. Andrei Kanchelskis Sold to Everton for \u00a35m, aged 26, July 1995 Coming so soon after the departures of Mark Hughes and Paul Ince, the winger's exit infuriated United's fans and prompted the Manchester Evening News to run a poll on whether Ferguson should be sacked - something he has never forgotten. Ferguson was unhappy with Kanchelskis's attitude and planned to introduce Beckham, Butt, Scholes and the Nevilles the following season. Kanchelskis had moderate spells at Everton, Fiorentina and Rangers, a bad one at Southampton, and is seeing out his career at Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia. Paul McGrath Sold to Aston Villa for \u00a3450,000, aged 29, August 1989 Ferguson wanted to eradicate the drinking culture that existed at the club and opted to sell McGrath (along with Norman Whiteside) after noticing 'he could hardly jog properly' in training one morning. McGrath went on to play the best football of his career for Graham Taylor's Aston Villa and Jack Charlton's Republic of Ireland team."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
