Aidy Boothroyd vowed not to quit following the team\u2019s elimination on Friday, insisting he needed to reflect on a campaign that has seen England \u2013 unbeaten in 10 qualifiers \u2013 concede six goals, give away three penalties and receive a damaging red card, with Monday\u2019s dead game against Croatia to come. On Saturday the head coach faced up to England\u2019s latest disappointment on the international stage. Here, in his own words, Boothroyd defends his strategy, his record \u2013 and his players. What was going through your mind last night? I didn\u2019t sleep. You always think to yourself: \u201cWhat could I have done differently? What could I have done better?\u201d Any half-decent coach asks themselves those questions when they are picking the bones out of something like that. And what conclusions did you draw? Well the questions straight after the game were about Phil [Foden]. \u201cWhy did you leave your best player out?\u201d I still think, sitting here, that it was the right thing to do. When he came off the pitch against the French, he was absolutely spent. Physically he was dead on his feet. It was the same with Ryan Sessegnon. The plan was to introduce them gradually because we were planning on being here for five games, not three. We introduced him at a point where he could weave his magic \u2013 which he did. So we got that right. Unfortunately in Ryan\u2019s case, he pulls his hamstring and we didn\u2019t get that with him. It\u2019s a balancing act. But it was a must-win game. Surely you start your best player? Well, you do, but if your best player has a really strong chance of getting injured because of the work that he has done then no, you don\u2019t. I think the fact that Sess pulled his hamstring is a testament to the fine line you walk. Were you over-confident? Even after the Romania defeat you had players claiming England were still the best team in the tournament. Do they need to learn a bit of humility? They are young, fit guys and I think that was just a reaction. I don\u2019t think we took anybody lightly. Maybe you guys did. Ultimately we made mistakes. We planned for months in advance, we knew what we were doing and we were really happy with everything around it. We have not been clinical. We have made individual errors towards the end of games. We were just not as good as we should have been. England\u2019s under-17s, -19s, -20s and now -21s have all performed badly this season, whether in European Championships or World Cup qualifying. Was 2017 [when England won the Under-17 and Under-20 World Cups] an anomaly rather than the foundation for future success? I\u2019m not sure it was an anomaly. I look at it like a club \u2013 the senior team is the most important. The reserve-team coach \u2013 me \u2013 his job is to get players into that team and to try to win football matches. Because the under-20s, under-19s and under-18s have done well their players have been hoiked up to me. Gareth has obviously taken the best players that he wants and needs. A lot of thought goes into it. We have to push people and stretch them and think about the longer\u2011term pressure. What I think has happened, to answer your question, is Gareth has taken players into the senior team, which is brilliant. I have taken players into the under-21s, and because of that everyone is a little bit weaker but the system is stronger. Do we need to be more realistic about these tournaments? It seems that you might have been hemmed in by the playing style and Romania\u2019s superior ring-craft. Ring-craft is a great phrase and I\u2019m going to steal it because it\u2019s right. We get into positions where we think: \u201cWe\u2019ve played some really good stuff.\u201d But we\u2019re scratching our heads on the way home after getting beaten. It\u2019s a key thing for us \u2013 managing momentum, match management, ring-craft. These are areas that we should be aware of, because we\u2019ve got a younger group, and be better at it. This line about \u201cthe best team here\u201d is a recurring theme among your players. Is there a problem that, because of having great contracts with famous football clubs, many of them are suffering delusions of grandeur? That might be a bit of bravado. The boys are not daft. They will hurt and they do hurt. They will reflect and that will start today. We think we\u2019re the best team but we\u2019re going home, why? The important thing is we don\u2019t brush anything under the carpet. We front it up. I honestly don\u2019t think we have got delusions of grandeur. We know what we are. Yes, we\u2019ve got a talented pool but looking at the longer term this talented pool, to be the best they can be, need to have these experiences and straight talking. It\u2019s not a question of pointing fingers and digging people out. It\u2019s a question of: \u201cRight, you play for England now.\u201d These are the key things we need to improve if we are going to get to the final stages of senior tournaments. You likened yourself to a reserve\u2011team coach but a reserve\u2011team coach doesn\u2019t face the pressure or scrutiny you are now under for going out of a tournament. Would you have wanted more established players here like Trent Alexander-Arnold and Joe Gomez or is winning at this level not the priority for the FA? I could do no wrong if everyone thought that. It is a fair point. This is pressure but a privilege. As disappointing as it is, we want players from here into the senior team. Hopefully in five or six years some of them will be excelling in the seniors and doing well at tournaments. How long do you think it will be before Foden is ready for the seniors? I think his next six months will be an indicator of where he gets to and what he is ready for internationally. But, thinking about September time, I\u2019d imagine he will be with me."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
