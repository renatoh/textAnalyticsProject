First, he notes that the education capital budget is being cut. He is right \u2013 but since the coalition is merely following Labour's plans for capital spending (indeed, adding \u00a32bn to these), this is not a powerful point for Labour to make. If Andy can tell us which other areas of capital spending he would cut to invest in schools, we could take his criticism more seriously. Second, he challenges my assertion that in delivering real growth of schools spending up until 2015 the coalition has gone beyond any pledge that Labour made. But Labour's commitment on schools was only until 2013, and since Labour provided no details of how its planned cuts were to be delivered, we have no assurance that even this would have been honoured in government. Finally, Andy questions whether the settlement will really allow schools to deliver the benefits of the pupil premium. I have confidence that schools can make a reality of the pupil premium, particularly schools with high levels of disadvantage. It is unreasonable to suggest there are no savings to be made in schools, and a real increase in the budget in the current environment is a good settlement which can still allow them to use the pupil premium to target real disadvantage. The coalition is acting decisively to tackle the huge budget deficit. When this work is complete, I can assure Andy and your readers that my colleagues and I will be doing everything we can to ensure that the education budget grows to reflect the importance of these crucial investments in the future of our young people.
