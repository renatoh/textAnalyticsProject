A victory for Spurs would have cut Chelsea\u2019s lead at the top of the table to a single point but Manuel Lanzini\u2019s winning goal for West Ham leaves Antonio Conte\u2019s men four points clear and with a game in hand over their nearest pursuers. They will secure the title if they beat Middlesbrough at Stamford Bridge on Monday and West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns on Friday. \u201cTo win a league or a trophy is about key moments,\u201d said Pochettino. \u201cThe match against West Ham] was a key moment ... if you want to be champions you must win. How, I don\u2019t know. We were missing a little bit but we move on and try to finish the season in the best way, still fighting.\u201d Tottenham\u2019s midfielder Eric Dier admitted his team\u2019s title aspirations are now highly unrealistic. \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing,\u201d said the 23-year-old. \u201cWe knew it was going to be tough a long time ago and we managed to bring it back to four points. After [this defeat] it\u2019s nearly impossible. But we will give everything for these last three games of the season, no matter what.\u201d Pochettino admitted his team failedto reach the level that they had attained while winning their previous nine matches in the league, describing his team\u2019s performance as \u201cjust OK\u201d. He said, however, that he remains proud of the challenge that his team have put up this season. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t our best performance, we tried,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t change my vision of my team. I\u2019m very proud. It\u2019s difficult to keep your level. When we conceded, [West Ham] played deeper, [it was] difficult to create chances. We miss a little bit of fluidity to play in possession and move the ball quick and try to find the space and break them down. In the end I am calm, disappointed like our players, but we move on.\u201d Pochetino said his decision to omit Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 from the starting line-up did not contribute to his team\u2019s defeat. Dier and Victor Wanyama began in central midfield in front of a back four, with Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 not arriving until the second half, just as he had done in the victory over Arsenal last weekend. \u201cOur strength is our collective, our squad,\u201d said Pochettino. \u201cWith Mousa we have lost and won. Football is not about one name, one player. It\u2019s to be strong like a unit. Mousa can bring things to the team like another player but I don\u2019t think this was about playing one player and not another.\u201d West Ham\u2019s manager, Slaven Bilic, said his team produced one of their best performances of their season to secure the win that banishes all relegation fears and all but relieves the pressure on him. \u201cWe deserved to win, we did everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way we did it was magnificent. Great determination, thinking about what each individual had to do. But to beat a team like Spurs you need more and we showed quality, especially in the second half. Friday night, underthe lights, against them, it was a big game for us and them. You can\u2019t beat the feeling.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
