All of us \u2013 either directly or through caring for our loved ones \u2013 have experienced the impact of mental illness. Statistics show that young people, people from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds, and LGBT identifying individuals are particularly at risk. Those who fall into more than one of these categories face a number of challenges. For Mikhara Ramsing, growing up as a gay South African Indian woman was difficult - even though she knew that other gay women of colour must exist, she felt invisible. \u201cWith a billion Indians in the world and 11 percent of young people identifying as LGBT+ \u2013 I knew people like me were out there,\u201d says Ramsing. \u201cBut meeting another queer woman of colour was a very different experience than just \u2018knowing\u2019 they existed.\u201d It was this feeling of isolation that motivated Ramsing to start her online community project, Ethnic LGBT+. Ramsing has travelled across Australia and South-East Asia collecting LGBT stories and sharing them on her platform. \u201cI wanted to show these young people that they had a safe place to read about similar people\u2019s experiences, to see themselves in other people\u2019s stories, and to know that they mattered.\u201d Alongside Ethnic LGBT+, Ramsing also runs another social enterprise, Ground Chai. The profits from the sale of Ramsing\u2019s chai tea (made with her Grandmother\u2019s recipe, but with an Australian wattleseed and cinnamon myrtle twist) fund her youth entrepreneurship workshops across rural and regional Australia. Both Ethnic LGBT+ and Ground Chai were initially fuelled by passion and Ramsing\u2019s savings alone \u2013 until she was awarded a Westpac Social Change Fellowship in 2018. \u201cI applied for the fellowship on the road - I was literally sitting on the side of the highway en route to Wilcannia [in NSW\u2019s Central Darling Shire],\u201d she says. \u201cThe town has one of the world\u2019s lowest life expectancies due to a range of factors, youth suicide being one of them - in fact, that\u2019s the biggest killer of people my age. It wasn\u2019t something I was able to reconcile and I wanted to make an impact in that space.\u201d With the extra funding, Ramsing has been able to train in design thinking at Harvard, attend and contribute to the Human Dignity Festival in Hong Kong, and \u2013 of course \u2013 fuel her beloved story sharing road trips across rural Australia. Travelling in a mobile tiny home, Ramsing and her partner first hit the road while Australia was locked in a tense equality debate. Their personal safety, and the vulnerability of their communities, were at the forefront of their minds \u2013 with many of the LGBT groups Ramsing was meeting with having been established in the wake of this tumultuous political atmosphere. Migrating from South Africa to rural Australia at the age of 13, Ramsing continued along a fairly traditional education and career trajectory until her mid-20s, when she built up the courage to \u2018walk the talk\u2019, and establish her own social enterprises. Though the term itself sounds relatively modern, the concept of social entrepreneurship is far from novel, as can be attested by Ramsing, whose parents lived in South Africa during the apartheid. \u201cDuring that time, my grandfather used his business to open up schools and provide people with an education,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been called social entrepreneurship back then, but that\u2019s what it was: using business for good. That idea was planted in my head from very early on.\u201d Ramsing\u2019s story isn\u2019t that different to that of many other young people. Having grown up in a culture with certain expectations, she found it difficult to forge her own path when it looked so different to how those around her expected it to look. It was this challenge that inspired her current social enterprises. \u201cThe real synergy between the two is the belief that stories save lives,\u201d says Ramsing. It was only through meeting other young entrepreneurs through various conferences and workshops, through the Westpac Fellowship, that Ramsing began to gain faith in her own abilities. She realised just how powerful story sharing can be, and how it could be used to spread courage and inspiration across communities that needed it. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know. When you gain access to other people\u2019s stories you start to dream bigger.\u201d Recently, Ramsing\u2019s love of stories and respect for their significance have taken her into somewhat unanticipated territory. She started noticing patterns in CALD LGBT journeys, and realised she had taken on more responsibility than she first realised. \u201cIf there\u2019s enough people saying something, then that\u2019s when our government has a role to play in making a change,\u201d she explains. This realisation prompted a move into the policy space: she has presented her findings to various ministers, and sits on the Queensland LGBTI Round table. \u201cI didn\u2019t see that coming \u2013 initially, it was very much people focussed,\u201d she says. \u201cI intuitively knew that just feeling heard is important for the individual. But being able to translate that into policy has been very rewarding. A real catalyst enabling me to do this was having a well-respected and known institution like Westpac back me, back my belief that this is important, that storytelling saves lives. This past year has just been packed with opportunities. It\u2019s all unfolded in ways I didn\u2019t expect - as life does.\u201d The Westpac Social Change Fellowship is one of five programs offered by the Westpac Scholars Trust.
