Collymore, who has completed the three-match suspension he collected for misconduct - ironically while playing for Leicester City - is expected to named in the Bradford City squad. And as far as his acquaintances in football are concerned, they do not come much aulder than Colin Murphy, co-ordinator of football at Filbert Street. It was during his spell as manager of Southend United in 1992 that Murphy, seeing the then 21-year-old Collymore languishing in the reserves at Crystal Palace, bought him for \u00a3100,000 and effectively lit the blue touch paper to launch the striker's career. Within a year it had taken off, courtesy of a \u00a32m switch to Nottingham Forest. Two England caps quickly followed but instead of continuing its explosive progress, it stalled at Liverpool and self-destructed at Aston Villa. Much the same happened at Leicester, where the under-achieving Collymore abandoned the career life raft thrown to him by Martin O Neill for the relegation-haunted Bantams. Inevitably for Murphy, Collymore's CV has been blighted by a self-inflicted waste of talent. \"Stan has enormous technical ability and should have played for England at least 50 times,\" Murphy says. \"But I think he has not been able to grasp the extent of the footballing talent he was born with.\" Murphy has an equally straightforward explanation for the problems that have beset Collymore since his departure from Roots Hall, problems that reached their nadir when he was treated for clinical depression. \"He didn't get much media exposure at Southend and his career was relatively trouble-free,\" Murphy adds. \"But when he moved on to Forest, Liverpool and Villa there was a lot more attention paid to him both on and off the field. For whatever reason, it seems that has presented some kind of difficulty.\" Diagnosing the problem and dealing with it are totally different issues, of course, and although Murphy and the Leicester manager Peter Taylor tried, eventually they gave up what was proving an unequal and all-too-distracting struggle. \"You've got to consider the time factor. Let's say you've got 11 players and you're spending a great deal than more than one-11th of your time with one of them, it affects efficiency and starts to take over,\" Murphy laments. \"Ultimately, if you've got a problem and you decide you can't deal with it, the thing to do is to let someone else have it, as was the case with Stan going to Bradford City.\" Not that Collymore's exit has left Leicester totally problem-free. \"Stan had all the ingredients we were looking for in a front player and losing him has wrecked the plans we had for our first-choice strike force.\" In addition to his obvious talents as a striker, Collymore was due to provide the experience in a pairing that would have seen him teamed with Ade Akinbiyi, City's record signing but a rookie in Premiership terms. Now Murphy has been charged with finding a replacement for Collymore, an assignment that is part of his role as co-ordinator of football - a job that was created by Taylor. \"Peter wanted more than what is traditionally regarded as an assistant so we got together and he told me what he was looking for,\" Murphy explains. \"He needed some back-up from someone who can show his hand in all departments of the club.\" As a former manager of Derby County, where he had the likes of Roy McFarland and Charlie George in the team, and after a long spell at Lincoln plus coaching stints in as diverse locations as the Republic of Ireland and Burma, Murphy has been through more footballing experiences than most and is well qualified for his current role. Yet despite that cosmopolitan background, Murphy is in agreement with Taylor that British is best in terms of recruitment for Leicester. City's starting XI for today's game is almost certain to comprise British-born players and that is how the pair plan to continue. Not, though, for reasons of xenophobia but of finance and practicality. \"Continental players can be fraught with problems. If you can guarantee you can get the best continentals then that's a different matter. \"We're not in that position at Leicester. As a result, if you're not careful, you'll end up pay ing \u00a36m for people who are moderate players in their own country. \"Above all, though, are we really giving enough chances to the players we have in this country? Players in the lower divisions or even from non-League? After all, that's where Stan Collymore started.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
