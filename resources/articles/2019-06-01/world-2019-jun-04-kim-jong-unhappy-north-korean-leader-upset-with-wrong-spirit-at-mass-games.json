Kim Yo-jong, who was by Kim\u2019s side throughout both of his meetings with the US president, was shown seated next to her brother at the event in Pyongyang on Monday evening. Reports suggested that he had ordered her to keep a low profile after the failure of his recent nuclear summit with Donald Trump. Kim was also accompanied by his wife, Ri Sol-ju, and senior North Korean officials at the 150,000-seat May Day Stadium to watch thousands of performers on the opening night of the event. Despite his sister\u2019s apparent appreciation for the gymnasts and dancers\u2019 efforts, the North Korean leader was unhappy with the performance. The state news agency KCNA said Kim had \u201ccalled creators of the performance and seriously criticised them for their wrong spirit of creation and irresponsible work attitude, pointing to the contents and forms of works\u201d. Noting that artists \u201chave a very important duty in socialist cultural construction,\u201d Kim \u201cset forth important tasks for correctly implementing the revolutionary policy of our Party on literature and art,\u201d KCNA added. Following rehearsals over several months, vast numbers of people in colourful costumes took part in the precision synchronised performance, portraying moments from Korean history and modern life. North Korean artistic performances are closely watched by observers for clues as to the authorities\u2019 priorities, such as whether they are highlighting economic achievements or military progress. The senior government officials present at the games included Kim Yong-chol, the North\u2019s counterpart to US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, in nuclear talks. South Korea\u2019s Chosun Ilbo newspaper had mistakenly reported that Kim Yong-chol had been sent to a labour camp after a second summit between Kim Jong-un and US president Donald Trump broke up without agreement in Hanoi in February. Unmentioned in the KCNA story was Kim Hyok-chol, North Korea\u2019s special envoy to the US who \u2013 according to the Chosun Ilbo newspaper \u2013 was executed by firing squad for \u201cbetraying the supreme leader\u201d after he was \u201cwon over to the US\u201d during pre-summit negotiations. On Tuesday, CNN, claimed that Kim was alive but in custody and under investigation for his role in the failed summit. Citing one of several unnamed sources, CNN said his fate had not been decided, but that he could still face \u201cheavy punishment\u201d. Kim Yo-jong had not appeared in public since April, when she attended supreme people\u2019s assembly, according to South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency. Speculation that she had been disciplined after Kim and Trump failed to reach an agreement at their February meeting in Hanoi rose after she was absent from Kim\u2019s entourage when he traveled to Vladivostok in April to meet Vladimir Putin, Yonhap added. The show, known in the North as a Grand Mass Gymnastics and Artistic Performance, is titled The Land of the People and is expected to run for five months, into October. Traditionally, the scenes on the arena floor take place against an ever-changing backdrop, made up of thousands of children turning the coloured pages of books in sequence to create giant images rippling across one side of the stadium."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
