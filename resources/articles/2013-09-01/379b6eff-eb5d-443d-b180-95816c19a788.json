But there is no doubt he will come back up again.\" When it was put to McGinley that McIlroy's trough has proved rather a deep one, the Dubliner was unmoved. \"Tom Watson went through one,\" added McGinley. \"Jack Nicklaus had a long period of time between winning one major and the next. It comes and goes, as some people come out of it very quickly. Just look at what's happened to Henrik Stenson. Rory is such a good player and he has so much drive. He will not be sitting back on his laurels; he will be practising hard. It will come back and things in his head will just click into place.\" Ewan Murray Moto GP: M\u00e1rquez on pole No7 The Championship leader, Eur, set a track record to claim pole position at the Aragon MotoGP. The defending champion Jorge Lorenzo starts today's race from second, followed by M\u00e1rquez's Honda team-mate and last year's winner in Aragon, Dani Pedrosa. The 20-year-old Spaniard beat Casey Stoner's fastest time in 2011 with a late flying lap of 1:47.804 at the 5km circuit. It was M\u00e1rquez's seventh pole in his first season in MotoGP. Lorenzo's Yamaha team-mate Valentino Rossi was fourth. Britain's Cal Crutchlow had a frustrating day as he could only manage seventh for Tech 3 Yamaha, with his team-mate Bradley Smith lining up alongside him in eighth.
