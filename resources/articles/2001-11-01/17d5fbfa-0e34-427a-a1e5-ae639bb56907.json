The 24-year-old rookie carded a final-round 69 for a 20-under-par total of 268 at Is Molas in Sardinia to collect the first prize of \u00a3103,000. The victory secured him a place in the \u00a32m Volvo Masters this week. \"My first goal was just to keep my card so this is a great bonus,\" said the Frenchman. Dredge, who also closed with a 69 for his best-ever finish, was left to rue a costly double-bogey six on the 5th after he hooked his tee shot and lost the ball in some bushes. Hertfordshire's Ian Poulter put up a fine defence of his title, firing his second hole-in-one of the season on the 14th in a final-round 67 that gave him a share of third place with Spain's Diego Borrego and England's Mark Roe and Shaun Webster. Roe's performance was enough to keep his card for next season, moving him up from 131st in the order of the merit at the start of the week to the top 115. But Webster will have to go the qualifying school this month after narrowly failing to claim the outright second place he needed to keep his card. The 38-year-old Roe's prospects did not look good when he began the day in 13th, seven shots off the lead, but he fired a flawless closing 66. \"That was fun today but it hasn't changed my viewpoint about playing less golf next year,\" said Roe, who can now pick and choose his events next season, which will be his 18th on tour and, he insists, his last. - PA \u00b7 Richard Bland produced the round of his life to win the Challenge Tour grand final in Bordeaux by five strokes and secure his card for the full European Tour next year. The Southampton player closed with a Challenge Tour career-best 63 for an 18-under-par total of 266 to leave his fellow Englishmen Philip Golding, Gary Clark and Andrew Marshall in his wake. One stroke behind overnight, Bland produced five birdies and an eagle to cover the back nine in 29. \"I couldn't have dreamed of playing like that,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
