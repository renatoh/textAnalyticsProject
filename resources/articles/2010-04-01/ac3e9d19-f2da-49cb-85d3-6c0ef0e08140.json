Leading 9-5, having claimed five of the afternoon's first six frames, through breaks of 92, 89, 86, 117 and 52, O'Sullivan led 9-5 but Selby, who had secured the other with one of 75, resolutely took the last two of the session with 104 and 62 to reduce the deficit to 9-7. O'Sullivan pushed on to 11-9 but Selby responded with a run of 108 and prevailed in three predominantly tactical frames as O'Sullivan's self-belief dwindled, clinching victory with a long green and, from an imperfect safety, a long brown. \"For the majority of the match I didn't score but I managed to revert to plan B and grind out frames. Sometimes it's not all about big breaks,\" Selby said. O'Sullivan tried his utmost but coped less well with the pressure. \"I can't keep coming here moaning and trying to understand what's going on in my little world. I haven't felt fully comfortable or confident for 17 or 18 years,\" he said. The last embers of Steve Davis's memorable 30th Crucible flickered but briefly as Neil Robertson duly completed the 13-5 trouncing which puts the Australian through to his second semi-final here. After his dramatic 10-9 win over Mark King and his epic 13-11 triumph against John Higgins, the defending champion, the 52-year-old Davis acknowledged that he \"never got going\" against Robertson but, if the game is made of memories, there are many for him to replay in his mind. \"I feel 10 years younger. I've had such great receptions from the crowd, I've thoroughly enjoyed myself and I didn't want it to stop. I've climbed a mountain to reach the quarter-finals,\" he said. \"While it might be easy to say I'm going to retire, it's worth it to carry on for the competitive buzz and to feel the juices flowing. Things like this inspire you to carry on.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
