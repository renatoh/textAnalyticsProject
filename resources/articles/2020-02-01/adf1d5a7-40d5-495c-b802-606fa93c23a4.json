Research shows many of us are trying to make more conscious choices, thinking about our impact and what we want from life. More and more, we\u2019re asking businesses such as our banks and super funds to better align with what we want, and to invest in things we can feel good about, that make a real and positive difference. We also want insurance that we can trust and a health fund that understands where we\u2019re at in life. The start of the year is a great time to evaluate your health insurance, shop around and optimise your life. And if you find a better fit, making the switch is easy. Here\u2019s how to choose a health fund that\u2019s the perfect fit. 1. Know where you\u2019re at Products and the services covered by health funds can be vastly different, and what suits someone else may not be right for you. Life may have changed significantly since you joined your current fund years ago, or maybe you have just stayed with the same provider as your parents. Either way, before you switch, think about who you are and where you\u2019re at. Maybe you\u2019re considering having a baby, or about to start a new job. You might want a health fund that complements your active lifestyle, or one that supports a specific community. Knowing what you need is the first step to finding the right fund for you.

Health funds that are not-for-profit or part of a not-for-profit group are able to put members first. On average, Members Health funds keep narrower margins and invest more of your paid premiums back into benefits. For-profit funds, on the other hand, have to maximise profits for investors and shareholders. Funds that make up Members Health return a higher proportion of member premiums back in benefits \u2013 on average it\u2019s 91%. It\u2019s no surprise that this is reflected in high satisfaction and high trust levels from members, who are also more likely to stick around. The health fund you choose can also have an impact on your community. Some Members Health funds are based in regional areas and support local charities, sporting clubs and health services. Or, they might be industry-based; for example, a fund that\u2019s tailored for teachers, police, military, doctors, bank employees, transport and energy employees, emergency services, nurses or others. All these factors might influence your choice. 3. Think about what you want your fund to deliver Health funds that are run for people, not for profits, are designed to give back to members, which can mean a better overall experience for you. Look for options that will have a direct benefit: - Customer service: support that\u2019s available and genuinely wants to help - Quality products: policies tailored to your individual health needs and stage of life, offering a combination of good-value prices, coverage and benefits - General wellbeing and preventative health: such as offers on dental, optical, osteo, chiro, physio and remedial massage - Complementary coverage: other high-quality insurance products, such as travel insurance - Convenience: digital tools, fast claims processing, and a caring person to speak to when you need it most - Strong values: a fund that aligns with your life, and puts you first No matter what insurer you decide to go with - big or small - all Australian health funds provide access to healthcare services across the entire country. 4. Do your research More information is available than ever before. If you\u2019re looking at an industry-specific health fund, ask colleagues for their experiences. Funds run for people, not profits, can deliver better value while being tailored to members\u2019 needs. Website aggregators can help you compare your options. For example, the Members Health site allows you to filter funds by relevant criteria so you can find and research funds from one place - including some you may never have heard of. Once you\u2019ve got a shortlist, it\u2019s worth contacting a fund directly to quiz it on what it offers and how it will give back to you. There are funds with benefits and options specific to your occupation. Composite: Guardian Labs/Getty Images. 5. Find a fund that will grow with you As we move through the different stages of life, our health care needs change. It\u2019s only logical, then, for you to regularly review your health insurance to ensure you\u2019re adequately covered. That said, switching funds every year is extra admin you don\u2019t need, so the best choice is the one that adapts to your life - whether you\u2019re adding or removing extras, adjusting coverage levels or transitioning children onto or off your policy. Certain fund benefits can be good for your wallet, too. Some health funds run their own dental and optical clinics, or have preferred provider arrangements in place. Some offer loyalty rewards programs, and some have increased claim limits for services such as dental, optical and physiotherapy. 6. Choose a fund that understands you Having so many options makes it easy to find a fund that wants what you want. When you work hard in your profession, you want companies that understand your unique needs, challenges and goals. Some health funds are run and owned by members from inside an industry or community, so they really get you. There are funds with benefits and options specific to your occupation. Maybe you or your family are in the emergency services or defence, or working as teachers or miners. Perhaps you\u2019re in transport or banking, or a health profession. You\u2019ll also find funds with great benefits and options that are run by members of regional communities. With 27 Members Health funds to choose from, there is bound to be a health fund out there to suit you. You might opt for a health fund that\u2019s focused on corporate social responsibility, pays out higher than average benefits or is a proactive contributor to your community. 7. Stay on top of your choice of fund Health funds regularly update their products and services to provide better options for members, so it pays to shop around. Do a regular health cover check: - Review your policy\u2019s restrictions - Make sure you understand any exclusions, excesses and co-payments - Check that you\u2019re on the most suitable plan, getting good value for money and not paying too much Before you spend another year with a fund that\u2019s not quite right, find a Members Health fund that\u2019s exactly what you need."}, "isHosted": false}}}
