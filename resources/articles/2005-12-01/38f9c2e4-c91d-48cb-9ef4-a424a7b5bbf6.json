So maybe it was to push science up the news agenda that Brown decided to announce new investments in medical research on the Thursday before last week's pre-budget report. As expected, the extra \u00a350m for stem cell research between now and 2008 grabbed the headlines. But the news that the UK's biomedical industry was poised to pour half a billion pounds extra a year into research should have turned heads too. Except that, despite Brown's wishes, it wasn't quite true. In his pre-budget speech, the chancellor announced that the biomedical industry was ready to invest half a billion pounds extra a year, rising to a billion extra in the \"medium- to long term\". But the devilish detail told another story. The cash would only come on stream if the government first sorted out the ailing R&amp;D infrastructure in the NHS and curbed the threat of animal rights extremism. Still, there was a plan for how to do this, Brown announced alongside news of the deal, making it seem like the money was in the bag. The NHS would get a streamlined IT system and a new national institute for health research to help with R&amp;D management. Cash would be ploughed into a handful of world-class research hospitals and animal rights activists would face \"firm action\". You can't really blame Brown for overstating his deal with the biomedical industry. The government has pledged to raise the UK's R&amp;D spend to 2.5% of GDP, assuming the lion's share will come from businesses spending more. But industry has not played ball. Last summer, the government admitted business spend had grown at a slower rate than GDP in 2003. And more grim tidings came in October, when the Department for Trade and Industry's scoreboard revealed that the UK's top 750 research-investing companies had cut their R&amp;D spend by 0.5% in 2004. What this means is that, in the face of growing competition from the Far East and unrelenting pressure from the US and Japan, it is still a battle to sell the UK as the site of choice for new labs. For all last week's deals and shows of strength, the UK may just be running to catch up. \u00b7 Linda Nordling is news editor of Research Fortnight. ln@researchresearch.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
