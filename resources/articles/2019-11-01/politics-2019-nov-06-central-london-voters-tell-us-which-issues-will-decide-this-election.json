For example, in a central London area that ranges from wealthy neighbourhoods such as Mayfair and Belgravia to more socially mixed ones like Soho, Paddington and Pimlico, issues range from homelessness, air quality and local development through to the role of the Square Mile. Equally, in a Tory-held seat which recorded Remain vote of more than 70pc, traditional political loyalties may well be in flux as Brexit sets up a potential realignment of politics. If you live in the constituency, can you tell us what is the most important factor influencing your vote? We\u2019d like to understand the big issues facing you and your family and which policies matter to you. How happy are you with the state of housing, work, community relations, policing and health services? Who has an impact on your community that we should meet? Are there issues in your family that create division? You may be a voter torn over whether to abandon long-term political loyalties due to Brexit. Are you thinking of switching your vote? Or perhaps you feel disengaged from national politics altogether. We\u2019d also like to know how you following this election whether traditional media such as TV and newspapers or online news sites or social media. Do you belong to local Facebook or WhatsApp groups?
