Our concern was that the Labour government was intervening in the work of schools in ways that were damaging the all-round education of our young people. Now, just over 100 days since the coalition took office, we consider that its rush to turn elite schools into academies (Rapid expansion of academies 'risky', warns watchdog, 10 September) and to encourage parental groups to create \"free schools\" is going to do greater damage. If these developments succeed in the way that Mr Gove is pursuing them, they will create a two-tier education system in England. A particular worry is that the success or otherwise of the free schools will not be in the public domain, since they are protected from the freedom of information legislation. These innovations seem driven by political ideology more than by educational evidence: they will undermine the democratic attempts by local authorities, once supported by the Lib Dems, to ensure that education serves all young people. In crude terms, there will be an upper tier of successful schools, mainly in affluent middle-class areas, and a lower tier of struggling schools, mainly in poorer working-class areas. The upper tier will be independent of local authorities and, in effect, by taking funding from them, reduce the support that the authorities can provide for the schools in the lower tier. Mr Gove denies there will be two tiers because the \"pupil premium\" for every underprivileged child will correct the underachievement of these children. The chance of the pupil premium being substantial enough to contribute significantly to raising the achievements of such children looks slim. Fragmenting the school system in this way fragments the world of opportunities for children. This works against social cohesion. Mr Gove should call together leading researchers into school admissions, governance and finances, with other experts and professional leaders, to advise him quickly on the likely consequences of his far-reaching policies. We urge him to delay making approvals beyond the 16 free schools and 32 new academies opening this term until this has been done. The last government often failed to anticipate negative consequences of its interventions: this proposal could enable Mr Gove to do better.
