I require talk. Every psychiatrist is a writer manqu\u00e9, exiled from the kingdom because he has to talk.\" The many tensions and similarities between the life and work of an artist and the life and work of a psychiatrist provide the animating forces behind his novel. But listening to McGrath discuss his life and work, it is hard not to wonder how much these tensions also animate him. Seamus Heaney once said that he had read so many times that he had been born on a farm called Mossbawn that he sometimes didn't believe it himself. McGrath knows the feeling. He has read nearly as often that he was brought up in the grounds of Broadmoor, the high-security Berkshire hospital for the criminally insane where his father was the physician superintendent. \"But I still believe it,\" McGrath says, laughing. \"And remember it very fondly. But I am increasingly conscious of that Borges story about his father talking about his early life in Buenos Aires. The father sort of stops himself at one stage and asks himself whether he was remembering Buenos Aires, or just remembering the last time he remembered Buenos Aires. My early life does seem to have taken on a life of its own.\" The unique location of McGrath's upbringing would always attract interest, but it is in its apparently intimate relationship to his subsequent work that it proves irresistibly fascinating. McGrath has featured versions of the hospital in several books, but even in those with no connection to the place, notions of unreliability precipitated by mental illness, of deep unconscious stirrings, of psychiatrists, and people turned mad by passion have all been communicated through his impeccably controlled prose. McGrath's early work, such as the story collection Blood and Water (1987) and his debut novel The Grotesque (1988), led him, rightly or wrongly, to be labelled a \"gothic\" writer. Lots of large damp houses in sepia-tinted home counties seemed to conceal awful secrets. Later novels drew less explicitly on the genre - although the tag still hangs around - but maintained an off-centred version of England as the location in which McGrath focused on the precarious states of mental health of his protagonists. These days McGrath still spends his summers in London, or in Ibiza, where I met him; but he has lived in New York since 1981. However, it wasn't until the turn of the century that his work began to embrace America, with Martha Peake (2000). His eighth novel, Trauma, is the first to be set entirely in New York with an exclusively American cast. It is also his most comprehensive treatment of a practising psychiatrist to date. Charlie is an early practitioner in the new field of post-traumatic stress disorder that was being pioneered in the 1970s as treatment for both returning Vietnam vets and women emerging from bad families or bad marriages. McGrath says his progression to dealing so explicitly with mental health medicine in his fiction was not planned, but in hindsight feels entirely organic. \"In my first stories I sort of stumbled into the first-person narrator which turned into the unreliable narrator. What I'd actually done was reinvent the wheel, but at the time I didn't know that and it felt like an exciting breakthrough. After that it was a short step to creating narrators whose unreliability is a psychological dysfunction.\" His first \"full-blown neurotic\" was probably the narrator of The Grotesque, but it was with his second novel, Spider (1990), that \"I realised my narrator was actually psychotic. We were in a story told from the point of view of a man who was suffering from schizophrenia. It was a daunting prospect, but I went for it and the deeper I went the more I realised that not only was I telling stories about the insane, but much of it read over to the lives of the ostensibly sane.\" McGrath was born in 1950 and by the time he was five - when family legend has it his mother declared he would be a poet - he was living on the Broadmoor estate. Rapists and murderers would work in the McGrath family garden; there were lurid stories from his father about patients such as the vicar who baked his wife's head in the oven, although McGrath makes it clear that he was made aware of the difference between a gruesome anecdote and the serious psychiatric work his father undertook. That said, the McGrath siblings - Patrick is the eldest of four - enjoyed relatively normal childhoods, with his sister Judy recalling that, even at times of high drama, when a patient had escaped, \"We'd be inside the estate happily riding round on our bikes.\" There were a lot of books in the house. His father would read Robbie Burns and cry. \"He'd sort of tear up and manipulate his own emotions.\" McGrath read \"virtually everything\" taking a \"passionate interest\" in horror stories but also Evelyn Waugh and Graham Greene. McGrath's Irish background meant summer holidays with family near Galway and has left him still rolling his Rs in a sort of brogue. When he was 13 he was sent to a Jesuit boarding school and although he lost his faith in his late teens, he remembers fondly early-morning mass as a small boy, \"with six or seven priests and sunlight streaming through stained glass on a crisp winter morning, the smell of incense and the Latin. It was grand. It's not surprising that Cardinal Newman's Anglo-Catholic revival in the 19th century was largely based on the aesthetic appeal of Catholic ritual.\" Tim Holmes, now a lawyer in Canada, was a schoolfriend of McGrath's and they have kept in touch ever since. He says the 13-year-old Patrick \"wasn't an easy fit. He didn't wear a uniform very well, was a bit chubby and a bit of a nonconformist. In other circumstances he would have been a typical victim of public school bullying. But he was so affable and funny and essentially a cool guy, that he quickly became part of the gang.\" McGrath had a \"proper 60s\" with festivals and hash and a \"rather ill-defined anti-authoritarian stance\". One of the consequences of his infatuation with the counterculture was that he \"messed up\" his education, and by the time he was 16 he had run away from school. Holmes says, in retrospect, that it \"looks more like he just chose his own path. But he certainly didn't make it easy for himself in that I think he fell into the trap of somehow competing with his father, who was a very formidable presence. And it was an interesting contest as his father was such a very conservative man while Patrick was this anti-establishment liberal.\" McGrath did eventually go to college but found himself rather lonely: \"I felt I was on the wrong track and had somehow lost something I should have held on to.\" He did have artistic ambitions but they were \"sort of shelved as practical choices\". Instead, having no idea what to do after college, when his father wangled him a job in a mental hospital in Canada he jumped at the chance. \"It was more about wanting to go to Canada than a deep interest in mental health, but after I got there I became more engaged and for four or five years I assumed I'd have a career in mental health or education.\" In Canada he came under the sway of a \"very charismatic\" Skinnerian psychologist and spent three years as a \"devout behaviourist who thought this was not only the answer to psychiatric ills, but also to all social ills\". When he became a teacher - one of only two male kindergarten teachers in the country - it was the start of the \"long march through the institutions\". \"But I just wasn't that good at teaching,\" he ruefully explains. \"I didn't really have the ability to organise classrooms and I didn't really find the fulfilment I thought I would. But looking back, it was probably essential I went through that period. It was characterised by a sort of hunger for the work that would eventually sustain me for the rest of my days. It was really all part of the quest.\" Holmes remembers the moment when McGrath, who by now was living on a beach on the Queen Charlotte Islands in British Columbia and making money playing guitar in bars, \"quite self-consciously announced that he was going down to Mexico for six months and he would come back a writer. And indeed he did come back with these notebooks filled with the most appalling and idiotic stories, but that was him started and he eventually made his way down to New York, where he actually pulled it off.\" McGrath arrived in Manhattan in 1981 and made his living by proofreading \"very dull textbooks about abstruse points of law or public administration\". The Tribeca area was just beginning to be colonised by artists - \"there was still nowhere you could buy food\" - and he remembers being thrilled by a sense of artistic energy. \"There were places you could read your work and a lot of little magazines were founded where you could see your stuff in print. It was very competitive and a very good training ground.\" Peter Carey, another adopted New Yorker, claims that McGrath's enthusiasm for the city has not been dimmed. \"He doesn't need expensive wine or clothes or property. He really just needs a place to write. That's what is at his core.\" Carey says McGrath is just about the only writer he talks to \"properly\" about writing, although \"it's not a matter of getting advice, but more just having someone who knows the journey and what you are grappling with. You do need someone who understands, although I remember once reading a bit from Port Mungo, when the characters arrived by ship in New York and saying to myself: 'So that's how it's done'.\" McGrath says from the beginning he had no interest in writing autobiographically, but instead wanted to amuse through parody and pastiche of genres. He produced detective stories, science fiction and absurdist surrealism. But gothic offered the most possibilities. The novelist Lynne Tillman met McGrath soon after he arrived in New York. \"His use of the gothic really gave me pause. And the way he has worked through different varieties of abnormality in his books has been fascinating. The business of what is normal and what is not normal has been crucial to him and I think New York, where many people lose themselves in the variety of experience and people, has been important to him.\" Carey agrees. \"The revolutionary notion of America means a lot to Patrick. His emotional investment in America at its best - and he is aware enough of America at its worst - is considerable. His heart is here to an important degree.\" McGrath has taken citizenship and as a member of the Democratic party is \"deeply angered and anguished\" by the actions of the Bush administration. Caryl Phillips says that at first sight McGrath has always been an anomalous figure, with his very English manners and seeming eschewal of the typical New York artistic attitude. \"So it's then a bit shocking to see just how well he is connected to the whole New York writing scene.\" For Phillips, his more recent books set in America are instructive. \"As Brits we like to think that we understand America through the Levis/McDonald's culture, the TV, films and music and so on. But it's only someone who lives in New York that realises just how complicated and precarious that culture is.\" Nevertheless, McGrath's status as an immigrant is also crucial, he believes. \"He is so good on betrayal and infidelity, and that essential unreliability comes from being displaced. As a migrant you don't have a reliable world around you, and a central theme of Patrick's work is not being able to trust things.\" McGrath says that, despite living in New York, he was for a long time \"comfortable\" setting his work in his own, eerily imaginative version of England. His wife, the actress and director Maria Aitken, read the books before they met and married - within a few weeks of meeting - in 1991. \"She could tell I was English,\" McGrath recalls, \"but she also knew something wasn't quite right. And I think that's a pretty good summing up of the England in my books.\" The labelling as a gothic writer in his early career did become problematic, and he complains that it encouraged people not to read the books attentively because \"they think they know what's going on before they start. Certainly in something like The Grotesque, and even in Martha Peake, I was being very deliberately gothic. In other books I thought I was trying to fry different fish.\" That said, he remains fascinated with the gothic literature that preceded Freud and is constantly delighted by \"insights into the mind that are constantly in evidence despite the absence of Freudian theory\". In his own, post-Freudian, depictions of human behaviour he has attempted to be as accurate as possible about mental illnesses. \"When I produced the schizophrenic, Spider, I spoke to my father who was very complimentary and said it was the best fictional account of a schizophrenic he had encountered. But when I explained how I thought the book would end, with Spider getting out alive and glimpsing that his entire structure of memory had been unreal, my father shook his head. He said 'that is not what happens to men like that'. It was a darker vision than I had in mind, but he spoke as one who knew. \"It has seemed to me that for a long time the writer and the psychiatrist have been up to very similar things in terms of the exploration of human dysfunction. The writer wants to create forms of entertainment and to give pleasure, the psychiatrist is engaged in a therapeutic task. But we are both essentially engaged in the exploration of human nature.\" \"I am, as will be apparent by now, a psychiatrist. I do professionally that which you do naturally for those you care for, those whose welfare has been entrusted to you. My office was for many years on Park Avenue, which is less impressive than it sounds. The rent was low, and so were my fees. I worked mostly with victims of trauma, who of all the mentally disturbed people in the city of New York feel it most acutely, that they are owed for what they've suffered. It makes them slow to pay their bills. I chose this line of work because of my mother, and I'm not alone in this. It is the mothers who propel most of us into psychiatry, usually because we have failed them.\" Early in my research I talked to a psychiatrist who said \"it's the mothers\" that make us go into this line of work. Then I came across Alice Miller's book The Drama of the Gifted Child, in which she says that no normal child becomes a psychiatrist. It seems if you have a difficult mother you become very sensitive to the tiny signals she puts out: is she angry? Will I get a slap or a kiss? And these are precisely the skills a psychiatrist requires. It made complete sense intuitively, and suddenly Charlie's life began to take shape in terms of a family constellation with him in relation to a difficult mother, then a favoured brother and then a ne'er-do-well father. It gave me the first real handle on his character."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
