Vital minutes were lost while they waited for a phone call from her mother to confirm medical expenses would be paid, even though Lane Fox is estimated to be worth \u00a320 million. 'It's very rare for people to be refused treatment but in places like America where patients might be facing a huge bill they may want to check that you will be able to pay before giving treatment,' said a spokeswoman from Direct Line. The incident has highlighted the need for travellers to make sure they have adequate medical cover (market research company Mintel estimates that 15 per cent of travellers don't bother with insurance at all) and to carry their insurance documents at all times. Why do I need medical cover? The Association of British Insurers says 25 per cent of all travel claims are related to medical treatment. Foreign travel exposes us to potential risks and illnesses that we might not encounter at home. The number one cause of death or injury for travellers is road accidents, followed by the beach (sunburn or drowning), accidents in hotels, tropical diseases and skiing. Then there's holiday behaviour itself: a Post Office survey found that 27 per cent of people say they take more risks on holiday. Risks might range from driving a moped without a helmet to swimming in the sea after drinking heavily. In some countries you may be refused treatment or face a huge medical bill if you are not adequately insured or do not have policy details with you. A Foreign Office spokeswoman advises: 'Have a copy of your travel insurance with your passport, leave a copy in the UK and keep a copy with you at all times.' How much does medical treatment cost abroad? Costs vary from country to country. America has the most expensive medical treatment in the world, followed by Canada. In Europe, Switzerland and Spain are the most expensive. As a rough guideline, the Foreign Office estimates that a week in intensive care in Hong Kong would cost \u00a39,000. An air ambulance from Spain to the UK costs approximately \u00a312,000 and heart surgery in the US could cost \u00a335,000 or more. So what does medical insurance cover me for? A good policy should cover you for all medical costs, repatriation arrangements and escorts by medical staff, travel expenses for next of kin, an ambulance service in the UK, multilingual assistance with hospitals and doctors, and should be up to \u00a31m for Europe and \u00a32m for the rest of the world. You should be covered for liability costs if you injure someone else, and legal expenses. What should I do if I need medical treatment abroad? In the event of sickness or injury while travelling, call your insurance company as soon as possible - it can talk to doctors to ensure you're getting the right treatment, and can translate if necessary, and the hospital or doctor may want confirmation that you are covered. Some insurance providers have their own medical teams who will fly out to collect you in an air ambulance if you need it. What isn't included?It varies, so check. To be covered for adventure sports such as snowboarding or sky-diving you may have to buy an extra policy. Remember that some policies will not cover you if you were drunk or on drugs when you injured yourself. Do I need medical insurance in EU countries? An E111 form will cover you for state-provided emergency treatment in the EU. The forms are available from post offices and must be stamped before departure. However, it is still advisable to purchase travel insurance as the E111 does not cover you for repatriation, and you won't necessarily be able to get the same treatments as you would on the NHS. You won't be covered for private treatment, and in some countries like Spain, if a doctor is called to a hotel they might take you to the expensive private clinic where they work. What happens if I'm somewhere really remote? The standard of facilities varies between countries, and the insurance company will decide if you can be treated there. It will speak to the doctor, and if it feels you would be at risk it will move you to the nearest safe place. Where can I buy a policy? Most travel agents, tour operators and travel websites will offer you insurance when you book your holiday with them - but it's worth shopping around for a good deal. For people who travel more than once a year, an annual policy is often better value. Many credit cards say they cover you for travel insurance, but check the small print. Sometimes you have to buy the holiday on the card to be covered, and some only cover you for medical costs, not repatriation. \u00b7 For more information: The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (0870 606 0290; www.fco.gov.uk) can give health and safety advice for each country, but contact your insurance company for more specific information on medical cover. \u00b7 Additional reporting by Carl Wilkinson"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
