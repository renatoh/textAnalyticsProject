Redknapp had accused the midfielder of being \u201cabout three stone overweight\u201d after Sunday\u2019s 3-2 home defeat by Liverpool. \u201cHe\u2019s not fit to play football unfortunately,\u201d said Redknapp before complaining about Taarabt\u2019s attitude. Taarabt claimed he was one kilo lighter than last season, which he spent on loan at Fulham and Milan, and said Redknapp\u2019s comments could damage his career. \u201cI think at the moment, because we are losing games he is getting upset and making excuses,\u201d the 25-year-old told the Sun. \u201cHe is an experienced manager and should have been able to control the situation.\u201d \u201cI am a professional \u2013 this is not about retaliation, this is about protecting my reputation,\u201d Taarabt told the Daily Mail. Taarabt, a former captain and fans\u2019 favourite at Loftus Road, joined QPR in August 2010 after a period on loan from Tottenham. He has played in only two Premier League games this season, one of them QPR\u2019s sole win \u2013 over Sunderland in August. \u201cMy job is to create, bring goals to the team. Maybe he expects me to make more tackles. I am not this type of player,\u201d Taarabt, a Morocco forward, told the Mail. \u201cI can only get fitness playing Premier League. You can train six or seven hours, but you won\u2019t be fit.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
