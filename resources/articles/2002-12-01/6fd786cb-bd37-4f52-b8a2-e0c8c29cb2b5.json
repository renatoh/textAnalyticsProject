The Chelsea goalkeeper is adamant he did not knowingly take drugs but may be advised by his lawyers to accept the findings of the test because of the difficulty of proving how cocaine innocently got into his system and to enable him to resume his career sooner. Bosnich has been suspended from all footballing activities until the charges are heard and could be banned for two years if found guilty. On the other hand, he could be playing within four months of his hearing if he agrees to undergo rehabilitation and counselling, with a suspension rather than a ban imposed during treatment. Chelsea have summoned Bosnich to an \"internal meeting\" and are widely expected to sack the Australian for breaching his contract, though they may wait for the FA to rule on the case. Bosnich has until January 10 to respond in writing to the FA's charges, after which a date for his hearing will be set. The FA confirmed: \"The charges respectively relate to bringing the game into disrepute and to breaching the FA's doping regulations by testing positive for a prohibited substance, namely cocaine.\" Bosnich would run a risk if he decides to contest the findings. It is rare for athletes to prove their innocence in drugs cases and he would face a lengthy ban if he challenges and is found guilty. By agreeing to rehabilitation he could expect to be readmitted to the sport more quickly. A speedy return would depend on a professional report confirming he was clean and fit to resume play ing. The FA would probably insist on at least three months of rehabilitation. Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, insisted that the charges need not mark the end of Bosnich's career. He recalled how Paul Merson publicly admitted to drug use and recovered to play in the Premiership. \"The player can undergo rehabilitation and can be classed as clean and come into the game after a period of time, but that depends on Mark,\" Taylor said. \"We have been in constant touch with Mark since this began and we have continued to be in touch with him. \"It is a very sensitive situation. A lot depends on [Bosnich's] attitude. Knowing him as I do I can't believe it is the end of the road or the end of his career. It's a matter of reassessing the situation and seeing if we can get a new start in the latter stages of his career.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
