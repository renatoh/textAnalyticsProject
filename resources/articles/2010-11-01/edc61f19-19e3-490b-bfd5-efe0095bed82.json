The hip-hop-savvy and improvisationally open Glasper has so far been one of this eclectic festival's brightest stars. Glasper's already absorbing set was transformed by an unscheduled appearance from the trumpeter Terence Blanchard. The change also substituted Glasper's usual drummer, Chris Dave, for the accomplished but very different Mark Colenburg \u2013 shifting the set from a coolly jazzy looseness toward Glasper's more familiarly brittle street groove. At first, the leader's captivating Rise and Shine, Herbie Hancock's I Have a Dream and Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit were segued into a stream of rocking chords, explosive right-hand lines and whiplash drum bursts. Then the guests showed up, and a 21st-century echo of Miles Davis's 1960s partnership with Herbie Hancock erupted: Blanchard's long, arching lines and fierce attack crossed Glasper's pressing chords and Dave's ingenious mix of hip-hop polyrhythms and arrhythmic swing. A more contemplative take on Miles Davis came later from the Danish trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg with the former Miles percussionist Marilyn Mazur, in a fitfully abstract set that drifted toward the enigmatic but was relieved by splashes of vivid colour. Even more vivid and not at all enigmatic was the early-evening music of the Township Comets at Dalston's Vortex, celebrating the immense influence of the jazzers of South Africa's townships on the UK scene. In its way, that was what the LJF is all about, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
