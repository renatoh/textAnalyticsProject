They\u2019re people, not problems, and their welfare is our priority at Brighton and Hove city council. Your report (UK homeless crisis triggers council purge of \u2018tent cities\u2019, 18 June) says we charge \u00a325 to return a confiscated tent to rough sleepers. The way we manage tents in the city reflects the range of reasons people camp illegally. Brighton is a tourist destination, and people often pitch tent on the beach in summer rather than paying for official campsites. The \u00a325 charge is for storage of tents removed following advice to the occupants that they\u2019re pitched where camping is not allowed. The fee is designed as a deterrent to stop people camping in the city. Tents are usually removed when they\u2019ve been abandoned. It\u2019s not always easy to know if a tent is abandoned or not when it\u2019s not in use. The \u00a325 storage fee is waived for anyone who is homeless or sleeping rough. Only two people have claimed their tents back from storage and neither was charged due to their circumstances.
