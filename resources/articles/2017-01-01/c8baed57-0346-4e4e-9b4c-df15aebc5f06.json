The former Chelsea midfielder was handsomely paid during his four years at Stamford Bridge but even he can only marvel at the numbers that have been quoted to Diego Costa from the Chinese club Tianjin Quanjian. \u201cFirstly, I have to congratulate him \u2013 to get an offer like this,\u201d Ballack says, with a broad smile. \u201cI never got an offer like this, although I got good money, as well.\u201d Tianjin Quanjian wanted Costa so badly this month that they were prepared to pay him an annual wage of \u00a330m and Ballack does not consider it a surprise of any sort that the Chelsea striker had his head turned. Who would not consider that kind of money, Ballack argues, from pretty safe ground? But as the dust settles \u2013 for now \u2013 on the episode, with the Brazilian-born Spain international back in the Chelsea team and back scoring goals, Ballack spoke eloquently about the distorting effect of the money from China and how, for the very top players, it had to be ignored. Ballack retired at the age of 35 after one final Champions League campaign with Bayer Leverkusen in 2011-12. He had joined them two years earlier from Chelsea, where he won five major honours, including the Premier League title in 2009-10, and he continues to follow the London club closely. He is back in town \u201cquite often\u201d and he loves to get himself along to matches at Stamford Bridge. He talks about the \u201cromantic\u201d feel of walking through the crowds to the old stadium and he laughs when it is put to him that there might be a few double-takes in his direction from supporters. \u201cI walk fast,\u201d he says. When Ballack considers the Costa situation, his argument comes down to sporting values while it addresses the financial aspect with a candour that will appeal to the club\u2019s rank-and-file fans. In short, Costa already earns so much money that he would struggle to spend it in a lifetime. Why would he need more in China? \u201cIt\u2019s crazy and they are numbers that we are not used to, even if in England there has been a lot of money involved for a while,\u201d Ballack says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s normal but hopefully we can come back to normal days and [Premier League] players can remember they are playing in the best league in the world. \u201cThat\u2019s what counts for you as a player if you are on a high salary and you are earning, let\u2019s say, enough money, which you normally can\u2019t spend in your lifetime. It\u2019s something you should really think about \u2013 where you play, what level you play, the audience.\u201d Ballack talks at London\u2019s The O2, which will host the inaugural Star Sixes in July \u2013 a six-a-side veterans\u2019 tournament with 12 national teams. He will captain Germany and he says that Dietmar Hamann, Jens Lehmann and Thomas Hitzlsperger will be alongside him. Talks are ongoing, he adds, with Torsten Frings and Miroslav Klose. Ballack spies Roberto Carlos, who will play for Brazil, and he greets him with the warmth and respect that the professionals reserve for old rivals while around the room are other players who have been signed up, including England\u2019s Rio Ferdinand and Michael Owen and Spain\u2019s Gaizka Mendieta. Yet it feels telling that not only will China have a team at the event but their league is the subject which sets the agenda with Ballack. \u201cIt seems to be another level since the guys from China disturbed the market a bit and the brains of the players,\u201d Ballack says. \u201cYou love what you do but it\u2019s still a job and you are limited in the time to earn money and you think about it if someone makes you a crazy offer. It\u2019s difficult for the clubs to put all the players who get a crazy offer back in line. \u201cChina\u2019s league is not well known [whereas] England has a history, and so does Spain and Germany and Europe as a whole. Football in Europe is No1 \u2013 that is what everyone watches because the best players in the world compete in this area. I don\u2019t want to say it should be like this forever because the market regulates itself but it is something you should think about as a player.\u201d Ballack has enjoyed watching Chelsea under Antonio Conte this season, although he does not consider it a surprise that they are on top of the table. The surprise, Ballack says, was that they were \u201cso bad last year\u201d. The club\u2019s lack of European football is a \u201cmassive advantage\u201d as it has allowed Conte to work intensively on fitness during the weeks, which \u201cyou normally can\u2019t do when you play international games; other teams have to train totally differently\u201d. Ballack acknowledges how Italian coaches such as Conte \u201clike to be on a good physical level\u201d but he also has praise for how he has man-managed the squad, following the trauma of the implosion under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho last season. Ballack was signed from Bayern Munich in 2006 by Mourinho \u2013 during his first spell in charge at Stamford Bridge \u2013 and he remembers how the manager would foster creative tensions. \u201cIt was always tense between the coach and the players. And, mostly, he was pushing us together as a group. He was a very special manager, who found a very special axis with the players. But, sometimes, it is not easy when you have 20 egos as players; sometimes, one or two can create a bit of trouble because they are not happy. \u201cSometimes, as a coach, it is difficult to do it over a long period. Sometimes, you lose it a bit. It is just a few percentage points and, sometimes, it is time to have a change and have your input at a new club. \u201cConte is fresh and his football is simple, clear football; very understandable. He is very competitive and when I talk to him, it is like Italian football \u2013 very organised, very disciplined and controlled. But not predictable.\u201d Ballack believes that Conte is the ideal manager to handle Costa. \u201cCosta has this Brazilian blood,\u201d Ballack says. \u201cOf course, South Americans are different from Europeans; I knew that when we played them. So there is an emotional aspect, if you can find the right access. But you can also use toughness. Conte took him out of the squad, which was an understandable situation. Costa\u2019s answer was good, as well. They are two high-class professionals, dealing with each other.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
