However, I still feel new to this game, and would like to know how often I should have my bike serviced. Is once a year OK? How often should I pump up my tyres? I have also heard that I should wash my bike regularly. Is there anything else I should be doing? Monique Corless, via email An annual service is fine if you do some work in the meantime. Definitely top up the pressure in your tyres at least monthly; get an upright pump to take the sweat out of it. Regular cleaning is a great idea if you can face it. The most useful thing you can do is clean the chain. It's a nasty job, but the most hassle-free way is a Park Tool chain cleaner, which clips over the chain and brushes it with eco-friendly solvent (bought separately). Relube afterwards. In general, the more you practise the art of cycle maintenance, the longer parts last, and the less you spend on servicing. And then there's the Zen thing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
