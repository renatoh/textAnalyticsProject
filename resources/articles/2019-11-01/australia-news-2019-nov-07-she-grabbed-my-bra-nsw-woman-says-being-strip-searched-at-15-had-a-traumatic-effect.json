Guardian Australia revealed on Wednesday that police in New South Wales have strip-searched 122 girls, including two 12-year-olds, in the past three years. The shocking figures come as the state\u2019s police watchdog investigates the potentially illegal strip-search of a 16-year-old girl at a music festival in 2018 and have led to calls from the Redfern Legal Centre \u2013 which first obtained the data \u2013 for a ban on strip-searching minors unless a court order is obtained. In 2011, Madz Piper, now 23 and living in Port Macquarie on the NSW mid-north coast, was taken to a Sydney police station after a minor incident. At the station, Piper says she was asked by an officer whether she \u201chad anything\u201d. When she produced a cigarette lighter, she was told she would be strip-searched. \u201cMy parents hadn\u2019t even been notified by then that I\u2019d been [taken to the station], but when I pulled the lighter out they told me I had to be strip-searched,\u201d she said. Piper was taken into an interview room where a female police officer instructed her to strip down to her bra and underpants. Despite still being in her underwear, she was told to \u201csquat and cough\u201d by the officer, before she says the officer \u201cgrabbed\u201d her bra and \u201cjiggled it\u201d. \u201cShe basically grabbed into my bra from underneath at the front and then pulled it out to wiggle it,\u201d Piper said. \u201cShe hooked her fingers into the bottom of the bra and sort of pulled it out and given it a good wiggle and jiggle around.\u201d The search Piper described was potentially illegal. In NSW, police must have a parent, guardian or support person present during the strip-search of a minor unless it\u2019s necessary for the safety of the person, or to prevent evidence being destroyed. They are also not permitted to conduct a search of a person\u2019s breasts unless the officer suspects \u201con reasonable grounds that it is necessary to do so for the purposes of the search\u201d and cannot conduct \u201can examination of the body by touch\u201d. Piper, who has police in her family and believes most officers \u201caren\u2019t bullies\u201d, says the experience has nonetheless had a \u201ctraumatic\u201d effect on her. \u201cWhen it happened, honestly, at the time I was really self-conscious about my body, so when they made me go into the room with [the female officer] and then strip to my undies it was already so intimidating,\u201d Piper told Guardian Australia. \u201cBut the way she grabbed my bra and pulled it and sort of jiggled it, it felt properly violating. It was very, it was really violating. It made me really uncomfortable. And, you know, I didn\u2019t realise it wasn\u2019t allowed, I didn\u2019t know I could say no. I was 15, you just do what you\u2019re told.\u201d The experience Piper described will raise further concerns about the use of police strip-search powers, and the long-term impact of the searches on young people. Peta Malins, a lecturer in criminology and justice studies at the RMIT University in Victoria, said it was \u201chorrifying\u201d to think about the impact of the searches on children and young people. \u201cThis has a really significant impact for anyone, but for kids to be being searched like that there is a real risk of a longer-term trauma,\u201d she said. \u201cJust the sense of powerlessness, it\u2019s not necessarily a sexual assault, but it\u2019s still an assault in the sense of an invasion of someone\u2019s body and bodily autonomy, which has very similar overlaps with a form of sexual assault.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Malins, who this year published a study on the emotional impact of drug dog detections and strip-searches, said the risk of long-term impacts both from trauma and a loss of trust in police were significant. \u201cOne of the things that came out of the research was how much people who were strip-searched were impacted in their perception of police, it produced a fear of them and a loss of trust,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s huge if we think about numbers of people who are being searched at music festivals and in those contexts.\u201d It\u2019s a feeling 19-year-old Lucy Moore understands. Moore, from Newcastle, north of Sydney, was strip-searched by police at the Hidden music festival in Sydney in March. After being stopped by officers with a drug-detection dog, she was taken to a room where a female officer instructed her to strip naked, squat and cough. She said that during the search, the female officer left the door to the room open, and that she could still see the male officers standing outside. \u201cAt the time it was sort of happening too quickly to really think about what to do,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cThey didn\u2019t really even question whether I was innocent, they just assumed I was guilty. The whole thing felt really degrading. I cried a lot.\u201d Despite not having any drugs on her, Moore says she was held by police for more than an hour after the search and continued to be interrogated by police. She told Guardian Australia she no longer felt she could trust police after the incident. \u201cI\u2019ve never had any trouble with police before, you know, not even a parking ticket, and so I went in thinking I\u2019m going to be fine, I\u2019ve done nothing wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the way they treated me, I can\u2019t look at them the same. You see them and you just feel like you know they\u2019re going to do something to you. You think it\u2019s going to happen again. Their presence just makes me feel so uneasy.\u201d The NSW Greens upper house MP David Shoebridge said strip-searches had become \u201cdisturbingly normal\u201d for police. \u201cStrip-searches are basically a form of legalised sexual assault, and when they are performed unlawfully this should be treated as a serious crime,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been so many cases of abuse that parliament needs to step up and limit police powers and properly fund police oversight.\u201d The use of strip-search powers in NSW has been placed under increased scrutiny since the Law Enforcement and Conduct Commission held public hearings for its investigation into the potentially illegal strip-search of a 16-year-old girl at a 2018 music festival. The inquiry heard some officers at the festival were not aware of their obligations in relation to the search of minors, and one senior constable admitted that all 19 of the searches he conducted may have been illegal. Last week the LECC revealed it investigated six separate allegations of misuse of strip-search powers by police last year. After the Guardian revealed on Wednesday that 122 minors including two 12-year-olds had been strip-searched in the last three years, the NSW police minister, David Elliott, said he \u201cwould want\u201d officers to strip-search his children if they were suspected of breaking the law."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
