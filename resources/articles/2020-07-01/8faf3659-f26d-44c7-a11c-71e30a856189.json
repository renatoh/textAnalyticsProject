The UK consumer organisation also said it was worryingly easy to create a fake business page on Facebook. News of its findings comes weeks after the Advertising Standards Authority announced it was launching a UK \u201cscam ad alert\u201d system in partnership with platforms including Facebook and Google, \u201cto help tackle bogus ads\u201d. Which? created two linked fake companies \u2013 a water brand named Remedii that \u201ccan help you lose weight [and] improve your mood\u201d, and an online service offering \u201cpseudo health and hydration advice\u201d called Natural Hydration. The consumer body said Google only required users to have a Gmail account to create adverts and that, while it did review those that were submitted, it did not verify whether the business existed or was legitimate, nor ask for proof of ID. In less than an hour, the ads Which? created for both fake businesses were approved by Google. They racked up nearly 100,000 impressions in a month. The fake ad for Natural Hydration appeared above the official NHS Scotland pages when users searched for \u201chydration advice\u201d. Which? said that although Facebook had restrictions relating to adverts that could cause harm, it had still uncovered problems. Using a personal Facebook account that required only an email address or mobile number to set up, Which? created a business page for Natural Hydration and produced a range of posts with \u201cpseudo health advice\u201d to promote it. Which? paid Facebook to promote the page, which notched up 500 likes in a week. A Google spokesperson said protecting consumers and credible businesses was its top priority. They said: \u201cWe have strict advertising policies in place to protect consumers and prohibit ads that intentionally mislead users or fail to deliver on the promoted product or service. \u201cWhen we become aware of ads that violate our policies, we take action. We are also constantly evaluating our policies and enforcement systems to continue to improve, and have recently introduced a new programme to verify each advertiser\u2019s identity in order for them to serve ads on our platforms.\u201d Google said it removed 2.7bn ads from its platforms in 2019. Facebook told Which? the Facebook page that was set up did not violate its community standards. It said: \u201cWe remove harmful misinformation that could contribute to physical harm, such as false health claims, and have strict policies against deceptive advertising and scams.\u201d A Facebook spokesperson said it had various processes in place to deal with scams but none of the ads contained any harmful content and no attempts were made to sell any products via the Facebook page. This meant the page did not test these processes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
