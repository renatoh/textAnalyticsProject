Close reading of the offer document to take over the club that Stan Kroenke issued last Friday shows two significant possible undertakings have been omitted. The first relates to the free cash in the club's current account. In any normal takeover the purchaser can do what he likes with the cash retained in the business. Indeed, often it bumps up the takeover price by an equivalent sum: shareholders may request a higher valuation for their equity since free cash can be used to pay them. There is no suggestion that the club's shareholder-directors, who recommended Kroenke's offer, have made such demands in this case. But despite the Guardian raising concerns last month there is nothing in the binding, 64-page offer document restricting his access to the money. This is important because Kroenke already owns 29.99% of Arsenal and about another 30% is not for sale at the current price. So his \u00a311,750-a-share offer, valuing the club at \u00a3731m in total, will cost him \u00a3290m at most. Using money raised from Arsenal's past parsimony might perhaps have bumped up the offer price by, potentially, about \u00a350m, or \u00a32,000 a share. Then there is the question of dividends: Arsenal have never paid one to shareholders but if Kroenke has run up big debts against other assets for the takeover and wants a dividend to pay for them then his statement about not securing debts against the club is irrelevant. A restriction on dividends is also absent from the offer document. Insiders stress that Kroenke has not burdened his other sports assets in this manner. Fine. But if he has no designs on dividends or the club's cash then it is puzzling why he chose not to make a clear statement to that effect. Acumen is all very well There is no questioning Stan Kroenke'sbusiness credentials. The billionaire US property mogul owns the freeholds to most stores in the Wal-Mart chain and his offer document makes great play of how he has combined \"his real-estate acumen and passion for sports\". He talks of how he upgraded his various franchises' homes to become \"first-class venues that enhance fans' entertainment experience\". But Gooners can be forgiven for greeting this news with a shrug. With the Emirates Stadium built and all-but paid for, the Highbury Square flats all sold and an \u00a311.8m deposit already taken on the club's only remaining development, at Queensland Road, that real-estate acumen will be pretty much redundant at Arsenal. Then there is his Altitude Sports &amp; Entertainment cable television channel, which carries the matches of his sports teams. But this is a model that will not be applied here given the Premier League's collective-bargaining agreements. With the executive and football management teams also going to be untouched, Kroenke's offer document has given no insights at all into how he will improve an underperforming Arsenal. Gardner giving a lot away Plymouth Argyle fans still have a club to support after last Friday's successful company voluntary arrangement secured its immediate future, and it is clear whom they have to thank. The club had \u00a313m of debts that threatened its existence. The former chairman Sir Roy Gardner and his Mastpoint associates had loaned a total of \u00a32.5m to Argyle, secured against the Home Park stadium, but agreed to support a takeover bid from an anonymous party that returned them only \u00a319,250, or 0.77p in the pound. So what motivated their approval of the CVA? One insolvency that led to a similarly bewildering outcome was the 2007 collapse of Leeds United, with \u00a335m of debt. The club's offshore creditors at one point supported a CVA that would have seen them write off 99% of all they were owed, on the proviso that Ken Bates remained chairman of the club. Four years later and Bates is now the owner. Plymouth's administrator, Brendan Guilfoyle, has admitted he does not know the identity of all the principals behind the preferred bid. Sound familiar? Perhaps Gardner et al considered \u00a32,480,750 a small price to pay to obviate a formal inquiry into the liquidation of a club he once ran but the CVA certainly leaves many unanswered questions. x-head The football authorities have invested so much effort into building a case against third-party ownership of players that Sunday's failure to prove wrongdoing at Queen's Park Rangers was a blow for the Football Association. After all, QPR had themselves admitted to the Football League that they had a third-party arrangement they wished to remove before the League brought in its own regulations against it. Yet the FA seems to have no stomach for any more fighting on the issue: word is it will not be mounting an appeal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
