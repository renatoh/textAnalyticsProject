Two sons were cut down by murderous redcoats in The Patriot, his daughter was a frumpy teen foolishly seeking guidance from a sexist, self-absorbed father in What Women Want, and now in M Night Shyamalan's portentous but oddly comical Signs, Gibson's asthmatic son is trapped in the basement of a rural Pennsylvania farmhouse without his respirator, which cannot be retrieved because space aliens that look like seven-foot asparagus stalks are clambering around upstairs. The obvious genetic question that comes to mind is how so many gangly, goofy, chunky, helpless kids could possibly have such a stud for a father. I blame it on Mom: divorced in What Women Want, stone dead in both The Patriot and Signs. The gals simply couldn't hold up their end of the bargain. Signs is the third entry in the scares of the Schuylkill series that began three years ago with The Sixth Sense. All of Shyamalan's convoluted, gimmicky films are set in or around Philadelphia, a fiercely proletarian sound surrounded by posh suburbs, from one of which Shyamalan hails. Signs is much better than Unbreakable, a cryptic, unsparingly lugubrious film that did not reward the viewer's patience in watching it, but it's nowhere near as good as The Sixth Sense. Although the cast is excellent and the story reasonably engaging, it has two insuperable weaknesses: it is far too jokey for a horror film and the creatures from outer space are not scary. As Signs opens, weird things are happening out in the family cornfield. Gibson, a protestant minister who lost his faith six months ago after his wife got cut in half by a truck driven by a man played by M Night Shyamalan, lives on a farm somewhere between Philadelphia and Trenton, New Jersey. One night he finds his two small children standing at the edge of a crop circle that was definitely not there earlier in the evening. At first, Gibson and his brother (Joaquin Phoenix) suspect that the crop circles are the work of local nerds who cannot get dates. But then similar configurations begin to appear in Mexico, India and many other exotic locales where there are no nerds. Soon, it becomes clear that the circles are runway markers on an extraterrestrial landing strip, and that the aliens are on the way. Normally this sort of stuff would scare the bejesus out of you. But in Shyamalan's hands, much of this material is played for laughs. One day Gibson comes home to find his children wearing aluminum foil hats on their heads. \"It's so the aliens can't read our minds,\" they explain. The next day he comes in and Phoenix is sporting a Saran-Wrap wizard's cap of his own. Gibson, still adhering to the dateless-nerds theory, declares, \"Everyone in this house has to calm down and eat some fruit.\" Sure, Mel. That'll help. It is not at all unusual for horror movies to contain some humorous elements, such as the scene in Jaws when Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw show each other their battle scars. But once the shark or hydra or eight-headed rat finally shows up, it's generally agreed that you have to cut the comedy and stick with the gruesome stuff. Shyamalan, a one-trick iconoclast, refuses to do so. The film remains disconcertingly goofy almost to the very end, culminating in a ridiculous group hug scene the night the aliens finally arrive. My favourite moment is when Gibson tells his son to shut up because it will scare his sister. \"I'm already scared,\" says the diminutive little girl, who earlier had asked why nerds who build crop structures in the middle of cornfields could not get dates. Abigail Breslin, the actress who plays Bo, is one of those cute-as-a-button tykes that you just can't help adoring. She is sombre, sweet, intense and charming. The camera loves her. Too bad she'll probably grow up to be Drew Barrymore. Signs is freighted with the kind of bargain-basement philosophising that gives bargain-basement philosophy a bad name. According to the director, still in his 20s, everything happens for a reason, nothing goes unexplained. The death of Gibson's wife was not fortuitous; his son's asthma has a larger purpose, his daughter's inability to finish drinking a glass of water will ultimately prove life-saving, his brother's failure to become a professional baseball player will eventually pay huge dividends. Everything, including this unexpected invasion of the body snatchers, is part of some divine or semi-divine plan; everything happens for a reason. I earnestly look forward to the moment when Shyamalan makes a motion picture explaining Aids, the Black Plague or the Holocaust. I'm still a bit fuzzy on where these things fit into the overall cosmic scene. The single biggest disappointment in Signs, an entertaining but stylistically confusing film, are the monsters from deep space. Baffled by door knobs, easily confined in pantries, lacking superhuman strength, and just generally kind of dorky, the infrequently seen two-legged vegetables simply aren't in the same league as the shark in Jaws, Al Pacino in Godfather II, Wes Studi in The Last Of The Mohicans, or even the gigantic worm in Anaconda. They are not particularly numerous, they are easily defeated, and they lack panache. To me, the scariest thing in Signs was the presence of Rory Culkin as Gibson's son. The spitting image of his older brother, who went from being the universally beloved tyke in Home Alone to Public Enemy No 1 almost overnight, Culkin inadvertently elicits terrifying memories of some of the most gruesome films in recent history: My Girl, Richie Rich, Home Alone. How the aliens thought they could compete with a family as menacing as the Culkins is totally beyond me. \u00b7 Signs is out now"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
