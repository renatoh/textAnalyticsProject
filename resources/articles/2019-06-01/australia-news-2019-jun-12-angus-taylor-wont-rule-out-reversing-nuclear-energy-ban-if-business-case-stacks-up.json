The first energy battle of the new parliament comes from within the party room, with a group of Queensland MPs, emboldened by that state\u2019s strong showing for the Coalition in the May election, leading a push to have nuclear energy reconsidered as part of Australia\u2019s power plan. While a peak lobby group representing the sector says a carbon price would be needed for nuclear to be an economically viable alternative, Australia\u2019s law against nuclear power is another impediment. But Taylor says the government would consider nuclear power if the economic case stacked up. \u201cI think, again, the prime minister has made many questions on this in the lead up to the election \u2026 right now it is illegal to build a nuclear power station and as he has said when there is a very clear business case which shows the economics of this can work, we are more than willing to consider it,\u201d he said. Pushed on what that business case would look like, Taylor said he would not give \u201ca lecture on business cases\u201d. \u201cI mean it is pretty straight forward, I mean the prime minister answered this question on a number of occasions before the election, there needs to be a clear business case,\u201d he said, before being asked directly if the government would change the law in the event a case presented itself. \u201cAs I say, let\u2019s not put the cart before the horse, if there is a clear business case there is a clear business case,\u201d he said. The nuclear question is not the only quandary facing the Morrison government in the energy space, as discussions over the rules for the Paris emissions reduction target continue within the international community. The main debate centres around whether countries which exceeded their Kyoto targets can use the excess abatement as credit towards their Paris targets. In Australia, that amounts to about 367 megatonnes, which Taylor has previously described as \u201crelatively small\u201d in terms of the nation\u2019s carbon budget, but \u201capocalyptic\u201d to the economy if not used. Repeatedly asked what the government\u2019s plan was in the event it was decided carryover credits could not be used, Taylor did not have an answer and instead reiterated that Australia had met its past targets. \u201cThe plan is clear, we have as a result of our actions, ensured that there is less carbon dioxide equivalent, in the atmosphere, than would have been the case,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 We have exceeded the Kyoto targets, we are expected to exceed the Kyoto targets by 367 million tonnes in 2020. The result of that is there is less carbon dioxide equivalent in the atmosphere parts per million than there otherwise would be, because of the hard work of Australians. \u201cI have watched, I have watched, right across Australia, businesses, farmers, small and large, drive emissions reductions through all sorts of means, energy-efficiency initiatives, and the outcome has been extraordinary. I mean, there were a lot of people telling us we weren\u2019t going to reach our Kyoto targets, but we\u2019ve done it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
