Government departments are busy preparing bids for their share of the money to be allocated by the chancellor for the next three years. Preparation will have been as prolonged and intense as any undertaken by bobsleighers or curlers. It is a competition which pits everyone against one another: permanent secretaries, ministers and, crucially, special advisers. The result of the Treasury race will have profound effects on the future of British sport. For years there has been inadequate investment by all governments. One reason for this has been the failure of those involved in sport collectively to bang their drum for more resources. Rarely are MPs lobbied at their advice surgeries on sporting issues. Most community sports groups are far too busy keeping their clubs functioning and, even when there is a financial crisis or a development threat to a playing field, campaigns take a while to get started. Contrast this with those in the arts world, who know where the power lies and how to bombard the media with \"crisis\" stories. This is one reason why millions more have consistently been allocated to the arts minister than to the sports minister. The last spending review in my first year as minister doubled the exchequer money over three years. Welcome as this was, it is still a pathetically small sum of \u00a3102m by 2003. There is no doubt that without the \u00a3220m income from the lottery, sport would wither. But already this figure is diminishing as fewer lottery tickets are sold and because the New Opportunities Fund reduced the percentage going directly to sport. The chancellor may well wish to take this into account. Equally he may wish to consider whether the distribution mechanism is really providing \"best value\". There are five Sports Councils, one for each of the home countries and a UK council which looks after the \"British\" dimension and funds elite sport and the UK Institute. The Central Council for Physical Recreation (CCPR) brings together all the sports' governing bodies but is allocated a tiny percentage of the exchequer funding. Meanwhile the British Olympic Association gets nothing from government, yet was able to allocate \u00a31m for the 50 members of Team GB in Utah. No rational person could possibly think that the way sport is organised is anything other than daft. There are too many quangos and no one in overall charge. Sport England, with the largest budget, spends too high a percentage on administration, glossy booklets and promoting its logo. Even a modest 2% cut in this would raise \u00a3860,000 and be a huge morale boost if paid directly to the governing bodies. Just when it seems that no one is listening there is a flicker of hope. The prime minister has asked the Performance and Innovation Unit to conduct a thorough review of sport, particularly its structures and organisation. I hope they start with a blank sheet. The last time there was a review it took five years and ended up creating a bigger bureaucracy. The running of sport should not be about preserving vested interests and jobs for the boys (or even the girls) but how to get the money used to the best effect. European spending on sport is just under \u00a35 per head. Ours, by the end of 2004, will be \u00a32. The Department of Health gets \u00a3750 per head. If only the chancellor would insist on genuine joined-up thinking in Whitehall, then it would be possible for sport to make a vital contribution not only to the health service but to prevent crime and engage those who are alienated from education. Sport is potentially the most exciting method of fulfilling government policy on social inclusion - no need for more working parties, seminars or think tanks. Those who have spent their lives in sport have always known the power it has to motivate and change lives. The CCPR is pleading for what may be termed a \"cross-Whitehall\" budget for sport. What Gordon Brown needs to do is make the departments stop competing. He should order the Home Office and the health department to contribute \u00a3200m each to a \"Sport Delivers\" kitty. Used imaginatively and in addition to current spending, this investment would reduce crime and save the health service money in the long term. It is time to make joined-up government a reality. \u00b7 The Kate Hoey column will return in a fortnight"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
