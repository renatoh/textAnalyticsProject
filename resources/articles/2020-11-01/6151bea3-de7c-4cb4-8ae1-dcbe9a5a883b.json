The New South Wales premier made the comment on Thursday night after the Liberal MP Catherine Cusack crossed the floor to send the local land services amendment (miscellaneous) bill to a committee to debate proposed amendments, delaying its passage until next year. In a joint statement on Thursday night, Berejiklian and her deputy, the Nationals leader, John Barilaro, said the government would effectively shelve its bill, which would have exempted private rural landholders from having to recognise the expanded definition of koala habitat under the koala state environmental planning policy (Sepp) that nearly split the Coalition. They said the government would develop a new koala policy in the new year and in the meantime would revert to the old koala state environmental planning policy, known as Sepp 44. Reverting to it would take koala protections in NSW back several years and would reduce the number of feed trees identified as important for the species from 123 to 10. On Friday morning the chief executive of the Nature Conservation Council of NSW, Chris Gambian, said it was a \u201cregression\u201d for koala protections at a time when the animal is under assessment for a national endangered listing. \u201cAll that good work planning had done in working up a decent Sepp is wasted,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous. The National party has spent a lot of time this year just wasting everybody\u2019s time.\u201d The bill on Thursday night was sent down 18-19. It prompted a crisis meeting of the NSW National party. An hour after the meeting was scheduled to begin, Berejiklian issued a statement saying Cusack would no longer serve as a parliamentary secretary. \u201cFollowing her decision today to move a non-Government amendment to a Government bill, I have made the decision to immediately remove Ms Catherine Cusack as a Parliamentary Secretary,\u201d the premier said. Barilaro criticised those who voted to delay the legislation. \u201cOur farmers deserve certainty and they do not deserve to be held to ransom by a Greens-controlled inquiry,\u201d the leaders\u2019 joint statement said. They said the NSW government would revert to Sepp 44 by the end of the month, \u201cand in the new year we will develop a policy to protect koalas and the interests of farmers\u201d. Sepp 44 was replaced by the koala state environmental planning policy (koala Sepp) in March, which set a new definition for koala habitat. The policy was developed after a 2016 report by the state\u2019s chief scientist found much more needed to be done to stabilise and increase koala populations. The amendments put by the government in the bill and debated in the upper house on Thursday would have made private rural landholders exempt from that new koala habitat definition. The amendments were a compromise reached after a rift between the Liberal and National parties, with the Nationals threatening to block the reform. Berejiklian in turn threatened to strip National party ministers of their portfolios. The NSW planning minister, Rob Stokes, has previously said the new koala habitat rules would not have any impact on farmers or require them to do any extra compliance work for ordinary farming activities, such as building new sheds. It would, however, impact property developers. The Labor party and the Greens also voted to refer the legislation to the parliament\u2019s planning and environment committee, chaired by the Greens MP Cate Faehrmann. The same committee conducted an inquiry that found that koalas are set to become extinct in NSW before 2050. Faehrmann said the legislation as drafted would have allowed land clearing to occur within \u201cenvironmental zones\u201d and removed the ability of local councils to require development applications for private native forestry operations. She said the National party had \u201cconcocted the crisis around the koala Sepp in order to progress their agenda to remove the government\u2019s regulatory oversight of environmental protections on rural land. \u201cThe Liberals have been taken for a ride by their National party colleagues. They have every right to be angry at what\u2019s in this bill because it does far more than simply tweak the new koala Sepp, it reads like the forestry and big agriculture industry\u2019s wishlist come true,. \u201cIt\u2019s abundantly clear that this bill was to be the National party\u2019s Trojan horse which would have seen decades of work on the government\u2019s primary mechanism to protect koalas discarded and nullify environmental protections on rural land.\u201d She praised Cusack\u2019s \u201ccourage\u201d in crossing the floor. \u201cI look forward to examining in detail the insanity of what the National party have just tried to pull off,\u201d she said. The independent MLC, Justin Field, said the outcome of Thursday night was that the state would now have to \u201crelitigate\u201d koala policy next year. He said it was a \u201ctotal capitulation\u201d by Berejiklian to the National party. \u201cIt rewards Barilaro\u2019s tantrum and it throws Catherine under a bus for raising legitimate concerns and wanting to have an inquiry,\u201d Field said. \u201cIf you want to protect koalas, you\u2019ve got to protect their trees. \u201cIf the Liberals keep acquiescing to National party demands, koalas will go extinct in NSW.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
