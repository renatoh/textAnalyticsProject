Age: Very recent. Any chance you could define it for me? Well, if nepotism is winning power or influence because of proximity to someone who is powerful or influential, the reverse must be being damaged by such an association. Are you thinking of anyone in particular? Samantha Cameron, the unfortunate wife of that chap who was prime minister several aeons ago and let loose the chaos now consuming the UK. What is her problem? I thought they were now living happily in a shed in the Cotswolds. He rarely ventures out of his designer shed, but she is a successful entrepreneur with her own fashion business. That is news to me. You need to start reading the fashion pages. In 2017, SamCam launched Cefinn, \u201ca London-based label creating chic, grownup fashion for the multitasking urban woman\u201d. Sounds lovely. Indeed it is. \u201cEasy to wear and elegantly understated, it\u2019s fashion you don\u2019t have to overthink.\u201d Describes me to a T. So what is her problem? The bloke in the shed. Dave? Yes. \u201cThere are some people who don\u2019t shop with us because of who my husband is,\u201d she told the Women Mean Business Live conference this week, admitting that Cameron\u2019s rock-bottom political reputation was affecting sales. Oh, what a shame. I sense you don\u2019t really mean that. You sense right. Odd name, Cefinn. It\u2019s pronounced \u201cSefin\u201d to rhyme with \u201cElfin\u201d, and is an acronym derived from the first and last letters of her surname, plus her children\u2019s initials: Elwen, Florence, Ivan and Nancy. Seems rather solipsistic. I think it is sweet. Is reverse nepotism a problem generally? It seems to be in the fashion industry. No one took Victoria Beckham seriously when she started out as a designer because she was a Spice Girl who had married a famous footballer. How about Stella McCartney? Never had a problem with reverse nepotism \u2013 ex-Beatles are sacrosanct \u2013 although her success has occasionally (and very unfairly) been attributed to her dad Paul. Do say: \u201cIsn\u2019t SamCam best known for luxury accessories?\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cThat\u2019s no way to refer to our former prime minister.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
