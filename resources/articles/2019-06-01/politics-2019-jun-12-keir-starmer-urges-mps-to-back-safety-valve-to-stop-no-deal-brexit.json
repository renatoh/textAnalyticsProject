Labour vowed it would not end efforts to stop no deal but the defeat bolstered Johnson\u2019s claim at his leadership launch that MPs would not be prepared to \u201creap the whirlwind\u201d of halting Brexit entirely as Tory MPs prepared for the first round on voting to choose the next prime minister on Thursday. Tory MPs cheered as the motion was defeated by a majority of 11 on Wednesday night, after which Jeremy Corbyn was heard to say: \u201cYou won\u2019t be cheering in September.\u201d The former Conservative MP Nick Boles warned opponents of a no-deal departure were fast running out of options \u2013 apart from a confidence vote to bring down the government. \u201cNo-deal Brexit on 31 October is back to being a racing certainty,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is very hard to see where any further legislative opportunities will come from. So it\u2019s now a question of politics \u2013 specifically whether a PM pursuing a no-deal Brexit can command and sustain the confidence of the House of Commons.\u201d Johnson officially launched his campaign on Wednesday saying he believed a new government \u201cwith a new mandate, a new optimism, a new determination\u201d could leave the EU with an amended deal by 31 October. However, the leadership frontrunner warned that he was determined to leave the EU by that date, whether he had achieved a new deal or not. \u201cI am not aiming for a no-deal outcome, I don\u2019t think we can end up with any such thing. But it is only responsible to prepare vigorously and seriously,\u201d he said. Johnson refused to say what he would do if he had not secured an improved deal in time for 31 October \u2013 or whether he would resign if the deadline were not met or no deal was prevented. Speaking after the defeat in the Commons, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said Labour would continue its cross-party efforts to stop no deal. \u201cLabour stands ready to use whatever mechanism it can to protect jobs, the economy and communities from the disastrous consequences of a no-deal Brexit,\u201d he said. \u201cAny Tory leadership candidate should know that parliament will continue to fight against no deal.\u201d One shadow minister said opponents of a no-deal Brexit had missed a crucial opportunity and believed they had been scuppered by the timing. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the end of it. We\u2019ll just have to be doubly creative,\u201d they said. \u201cThe timing in the midst of [the] Tory leadership [contest] is poor, but not our choice.\u201d Eight Labour MPs including Caroline Flint, John Mann and Graham Stringer voted with the government against the motion and 13 more abstained. Ten Conservative MPs voted with Labour. The debate before the vote revealed fraying tempers in all wings of both parties. The Labour MP Gareth Snell, who represents the leave-voting seat of Stoke-on-Trent Central, said he regretted not voting for Theresa May\u2019s Brexit agreement. He said he would abstain because he could not countenance parliamentary manoeuvres that would lead to a further delay. \u201cWe will have been responsible for a no-deal Brexit by default because of our inability to make a decision,\u201d Snell said. The former attorney general Dominic Grieve said he was prepared to resign the Conservative whip and go against the government in a no-confidence vote if it would prevent a no-deal Brexit. \u201cI simply have to say, here and now, I will not hesitate to do that if that is what is attempted,\u201d he said. The motion proposed giving MPs control of the parliamentary agenda in a fortnight\u2019s time. That day could then have been used to begin legislation to prevent the UK from leaving the EU without a deal, though it is uncertain what form this would take. Speaking in the debate, Starmer said MPs had been forced to act because of suggestions from leadership candidates including Johnson and Dominic Raab that the UK would leave \u2013 come what may \u2013 on 31 October. Raab had even suggested he would be prepared to prorogue parliament to stop MPs\u2019 efforts to prevent a no-deal Brexit. \u201cIt will introduce a safety valve in the Brexit process and it will be a reminder to all Conservative leadership candidates that this house will take every step necessary to prevent a no deal,\u201d Starmer said. The motion, which Labour tabled during an opposition day debate, was signed by the former Conservative minister Oliver Letwin and the leaders of the Scottish National party, Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Green party. The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, said it was a \u201cblind motion\u201d that gave no indication as to what path MPs would try to pursue to block a no-deal departure, and would have \u201cvirtually unlimited scope\u201d. Tory MPs who said they intended to back the plan included Grieve, Antoinette Sandbach, Sam Gyimah and Jonathan Djanogly, plus Boles, who had flown back to the UK specifically to vote on the motion. MPs working across parties believed it was essential to try to start efforts to halt a no-deal Brexit before the next prime minister was installed and prior to the start of the summer recess. There are no further opposition day debates scheduled. Tory leadership candidates including Matt Hancock and Rory Stewart, who have opposed no deal, had earlier made it clear they would not back the motion. But Hancock told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s no good just having a Brexit position that is built on either re-running the old plan, which failed; or threatening no deal, when parliament has voted in the past already to block no deal. No deal isn\u2019t a policy choice that is available to the next prime minister.\u201d Earlier, Philip Hammond said Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan was impossible as the UK will not be able to leave the EU with a deal or without a deal by the end of October. Hammond cast doubt on the viability of the Brexit promises of Johnson and other Tory leadership contenders as he gave a speech in Westminster. He said many of the candidates were pledging things that they could not deliver. Asked whether Johnson\u2019s plan to leave on 31 October would work, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t think so \u2026 I think it\u2019s not sensible for candidates to box themselves into a corner on this. Parliament will not allow a no-deal exit from the EU and our experience has suggested it may not be that easy to secure a deal in parliament.\u201d The idea of leaving with a deal by that date would be \u201cvery difficult or impossible\u201d, he said. Leadership contender Jeremy Hunt was also asked about Hammond\u2019s comments and said: \u201cThis is a time for skilled negotiation and not empty threats. I\u2019ve always wanted to keep no deal on the table as one of our negotiating levers but we can\u2019t be blind to the fact that there is a strong majority in parliament against no deal and it\u2019s likely that parliament would find a way to block no deal if that was being pursued by the prime minister. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need to find a way through this that gets us a deal. And if we want Brexit we need to choose a prime minister who can get us a deal.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
