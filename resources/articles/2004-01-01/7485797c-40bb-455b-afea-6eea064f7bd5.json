Such bodies now pay \u00a330 for a five-year alcohol permit but the new fees are set to increase to up to \u00a3150 a year plus a one-off fee of up to \u00a3500, though officials claim that small clubs would not be paying whatever the full rate is set at. But the protestors argue that most rely heavily on revenue from clubhouse bars and many will not be able to afford the changes due shortly under the new Licensing Act. The issue is to be raised in the House of Commons and House of Lords next week with the campaigners demanding a special exemption for the 600 or so amateur sports clubs with bars, or for the fees to be frozen at the current level. Some clubs have already written to the sports minister Richard Caborn in protest and have also contacted the local authorities responsible for issuing drinks licences. A spokesman for Osterley rugby club in west London said: \"The majority of our income is from the bar and it is crucial for our financial survival. The other main way amateur sports clubs make money is through subscriptions but that is not enough to keep them going.\" The shadow sports minister, Lord Moynihan, is to raise the issue in parliament next week and said: \"We tried to get an exemption for sports clubs when the Licensing Act was going through parliament but the government rejected this. \"Ideally we would like to see sports clubs paying the fees they currently do for a drinks licence. Amateur clubs are the foundation for success of sport in this country.\" A spokesman for the Department of Media, Culture and Sport, which is responsible for the new act, said: \"In reality most sports clubs are small concerns so they will not have to pay as much as bigger venues. Under the new system ... a single certificate which will cover them for whatever they want to do will be less costly and less bureaucratic.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
