The doctor, a true Frenchman, prescribed the following treatment for complete recovery: an orange and half a glass of champagne every day, plus a Mediterranean climate. The family was filled with dismay. The oranges and the champagne, though scarce and therefore expensive, could be obtained, but the idea of taking the whole family south - even for a holiday - was completely impossible. Until the doctor mentioned an island off the coast of Vend\u00e9e, less than an hour's drive from their home in Vitr\u00e9, where the Gulf Stream had created a virtual micro- climate with temperatures, on average, five degrees warmer than the mainland. At that time, the island was almost deserted, with miles of marshlands, pine woods and rolling dunes - occasionally punctuated by a windmill or a cluster of whitewashed houses - leading gently down to smooth broad beaches of pale, peerless sand. My grandfather bought a cottage on the edge of the beach, which for 45 years became a holiday home for all the family. My aunt eventually married a local fisherman and lives there still; my cousins live and work there. I was two weeks old when I was introduced to the place; and from that moment I was hooked. Part of my passion for islands lies in their seclusion. To me, an island is a frontier world: cut off; primitive; individual; a place of escape. And when I'm on holiday, that is exactly what I want to do: escape to a place where there is (preferably) no television, no mobile phone reception and no branch of any popular fast-food outlet. Nowadays it may seem odd to look for such an escape in Brittany, of all places, where British tourists outnumber locals by about five to one. Even my grandfather's home is virtually unrecognisable in summer, tamed and tailored to the needs of tens of thousands of visitors. But there are more than 800 islands along the Brittany coast, each with its own customs, folklore, climate and personality. To anyone searching for the perfect bolthole, there are places on that coast which remain more or less unchanged and undamaged by the tourist tidal waves of July and August, waiting to open up their secrets to anyone ready to cherish and understand them. Here are a few, all worth exploring, all magical in their own way. I'm still looking for my island, of course, but who knows? One of these may turn out to be yours. Br\u00e9hat The celebrated 'isle of two faces' is only a 15-minute ferry ride from the Pointe de l'Arcouest. Before you go there, it's worth a diversion to Le Gouffre to see the much-photographed little house between the rocks. Br\u00e9hat consists of two islands, joined by the narrow Pont Vauban. The south island is a place of astonishing diversity and colour; turquoise sea, pink granite, with mimosa, palm trees, camellias and eucalyptus basking in the warmth of the Gulf Stream. There are little bays, sheltered from the wind; gentle hills; woods of sea pines; granite houses with roofs of dark-blue slate crouching beneath a luminous sky. By comparison the north island is bleak and sparse, with its small, low houses huddled against the harsh and changing winds. But the cliffs with their rocky escarpments are a wonderful habitat for many 6 of birds and in spring there are sometimes seals on the outer islets and on the green, stony flats. How to get there: Ferries leave Arcouest, near Paimpol (year round) and St Quay Portieux (summer). The return journey costs \u00a35. Where to stay: The traditional Breton-style La Vieille Auberge (0033 296 200024) has 14 rooms for \u00a336-47 per person, half board. Batz Moving around the coast near Roscoff, we have Batz, a temperate, sandy island mainly given over to agriculture. Cars are banned and farming is often done the ancient way, with seaweed used as a natural fertiliser for the fruit and vegetables which are its principal wealth. Folklore is abundant; from the miracles of St Pol-Aur\u00e9lien to the rock of the Toul-ar-Sarpant, the 'Dragon's Hole', which emits the haunting cries of its legendary occupant on stormy nights. How to get there: Ferries leave Roscoff for the 15-minute voyage. Bookings not needed; the ferry is every half hour in summer until 7.30pm; out of season, there are eight daily departures. \u00a34 return. Where to stay: Direct Travel France (0870 770 0370) has a cottage for five close to the beach for \u00a3852 a week. Ouessant Ouessant - 'the Terrible One', according to its Breton name, is a Gothic and strangely captivating pile of rocks more than two hours from Brest. Lashed by the sea and the west wind, looming ominously out of the mists, it is an island of ancient,bloody history, built on granite and the will to survive. Its local name, 'the isle of women', refers to a strong matriarchal tendency (its men are seafarers), which still endures. The great charm of this island is in its dramatic scenery. Don't pack for the beach, but do indulge your inner misanthropist with wild walks along the cliffs and haunted crags. How to get there: Ferries leave Le Conquet (1hr), Brest (2 hrs 30mins) and Camaret (1hr 15mins) and cost \u00a317-20. Reservations must be made at least 48 hours in advance on 0033 298 808080. Tourists cannot take cars. Where to stay: The Hotel Roch'h Ar Mor (0033 298 488900) has 15 rooms, with prices from \u00a332-\u00a350 for two . Mol\u00e8ne 'The Bald One' is the largest of a group of islands off Brest. It is well-named; bald, flat, and sparsely covered, it is more of a haven for sheep, grey seals and birds than for visitors and has a population of only 300. Quiet, peaceful and welcoming in spite of the perilous reefs that surround it, the island and its inhabitants have retained a unique character. Even time works differently here; for eccentric historical reasons, the inhabitants use GMT rather than the 'local' time of the mainland, which means a difference of up to two hours in summer to the rest of France. Naturally, to the people of Mol\u00e8ne, the rest of the country has got it wrong_ How to get there: Ferries from Le Conquet, Brest and Camaret cost \u00a315-\u00a317.50. Le Conquet has up to four departures a day in peak season; Camaret has departures on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Reservations must be made at least 48 hours ahead on 0033 298 808080. Where to stay: Le Kastell an Daol (0033 298 073911), a 10-room hotel, has double rooms for \u00a340.50 for two with no meals, or \u20ac110 for two half board. Ile de Sein Further south, the Ile de Sein is the most secretive island on this coast. Most of its 300 people live in the single settlement, work on the mainland and return home at weekends, or eke out a living as fishermen. Few concessions are made to tourism, although the people are friendly enough. This flat, low island has no fresh water and is constantly at the mercy of the high tides and high winds that threaten repeatedly to obliterate it. But the S\u00e9nans are used to battling the sea; there are prehistoric settlements and menhirs and fallen megaliths attest to the ancient appeal of this enigmatic place. Here, pagan spirituality is part of the landscape, in spite of the Chapelle St-Corentin which stands so self-consciously under the lighthouse beacon. Not at all difficult to imagine that there are ghosts here; it is a world apart, difficult, remote but oddly engaging. How to get there: Ferries sail from Audierne (1hr, with daily sailings year round rising to three times a day in summer) and Camaret (1hr 30mins, summer Sundays only). Bookings must be made on 0033 298 707070. No cars. Where to stay: There are no hotels, but you can hire a quayside property through French Connections for \u00a3310-\u00a3410 a week. Sleeps up to 12. Gl\u00e9nan group A complete contrast to the dangerous charm of Ouessant or the Ile de Sein are the Gl\u00e9nan group. Drenec, Cigogne, Bananec, Saint-Nicolas, le Loc'h, Penfret; there are seven principal islands and several smaller ones in this archipelago off the bay of For\u00eat-Fouesnant, all scattered across a kind of lagoon surrounded by reefs. In fact, from the air they look more like Pacific than Atlantic islands with their skirts of pale sand against a sea of tropical clarity; this is a place for any one who has ever dreamed of being Robinson Crusoe - although access is not easy, as you can tell from the litter of ancient wrecks that surround the little lagoon. But the magic of the Gl\u00e9nan by far outweighs any difficulties encountered in getting there; every island is uniquely and breathtakingly lovely, a paradise for sailors, fishermen or scuba-divers. Only one family now lives here, so Crusoe fantasists can have a desert island all to themselves. How to get there: Ferries leave Concarneau from Easter to September, for \u00a315 return, passengers only. No booking needed. Where to stay: There are no hotels on the islands, but an apartment sleeping five at nearby Cap Coz costs \u00a3555 in early June through Perfect Places (0870 366 7562). Groix 'The Joyous One' lies about an hour's easy ferry ride from Lorient. In its heyday its main harbour of Port-Tudy was the most famous tuna port in France. The town is still a shrine to the maritime tradition, with dozens of fish restaurants lining the tortuous, narrow streets, while even now the harbour is thronged with dundees, the region's brightly coloured fishing boats. To the south-east lies the lighthouse locals call le Grand Phare, which stands on the rocky and dramatic promontory of Pen Men, and the little harbour of Port Saint-Nicolas. Near the lower end of the island, there is the famous white beach of Les Grands Sables and the little town of Locmaria, a warren of tiny streets and fountains built around the chapel of Notre-Dame-de-Plasmec. How to get there: Ferries from Lorient take 45 minutes for \u00a315 return. Where to stay: Hotel de la Marine (0033 297 868005) has 22 rooms in an old bourgeois house. A double room with sea view in summer costs \u00a350 for two. Belle-Ile Last we come to Belle-Ile, 'the Beautiful'. Perhaps the best-known of the islands, it is the largest and most idyllic of its group. Ringed with sandy beaches, it lies in a nest of smaller islands, the Ponant group, and is bracketed between the twin islets of Houat ('the Duck') and Ho\u00ebdic ('the Duckling'). Its approach by ferry is from Port-Maria on the Quiberon peninsula, passing through a wicked gauntlet of towering spindles of rock with names like Taillefer and le Cardinal, as well as a number of caves, including the spectacular Grotte de l'Apothicairerie. Belle-Ile is the traditional home of dreamers and lovers. Monet painted here and complained of the impossible, unearthly light as he tried to capture the sunset on the ruins of fortified Bangor. The poets Pr\u00e9vert and Desnos both wrote elegies to the little town of Sauzon, with its pink and white, strangely impressionistic-looking houses with their bright shutters, and the fleet of fishing boats at the mouth of the creek. It was a passing-place for English seamen as early as the fourth century and it - indeed the whole island - remains one of the most beautiful and most often-visited parts of the region. The principal town, the port of le Palais, looks like a miniature version of Saint-Malo with its ramparts and its tall granite mansions. But the enduring appeal of Belle-Ile has little do to with architecture. Something here speaks to the imagination; the fortress towns; the rocky northern coast; the white-fringed beaches; the meadows of flowers. There is a different charm here to the rough magic of Ouessant or the solitude of the Gl\u00e9nan. A tame magic, perhaps, and yet, having seen it, it is no surprise that Belle-Ile, 'the Well-Named One', has fascinated and tormented poets, writers and artists for centuries. How to get there: Ferries leave Lorient (in July and August, 1hr) and Quiberon (year round, 45mins). Passengers about \u00a315. Where to stay: Perched over the port at Sauzon and less than 100m from the beach, Le Cardinal (0033 297 316160) is a modern hotel with 79 rooms, with prices for two from \u00a345 to\u00a391 . These are only a handful of Brittany's islands. Only the few with yachts are lucky enough to have access to the rest, although ferry services have begun to improve, opening the way to places hitherto closed to tourism. But be warned before you begin your explorations; there is something insidious, something dangerously addictive about islands. My grandfather planned a single holiday on one and stayed 45 years. My aunt went there to recuperate and has never really left. I have relatives scattered across various islands all down the west coast of France and I sense that it is only a matter of time before I myself, like my grandparents, fall, irrevocably, in love. Fortunately, the search for the perfect island can take years and some islands stubbornly refuse to be found at all. This, however, is part of the fun: but whether you have a genuine passion or are planning a simple flirtation; be warned. Leaving your island - when you find it - may be far more difficult than getting there. \u00b7 More information: France Information Line (09068 244123 at 60p/minute)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
