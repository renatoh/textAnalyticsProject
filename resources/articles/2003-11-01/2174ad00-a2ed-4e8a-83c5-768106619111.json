Mr Howard said governments had to create a climate in which taxes were kept low and enterprise was encouraged. He said earnings were falling because of tax rises in April. In his first major speech since taking over the leadership, Mr Howard said Labour had shown raising taxes was not the best way of funding improvements to public services. Tax bills had gone up, but people's expectations of improvements had not been met. \"Governments must help to create the economic climate in which people are encouraged to show responsibility for others,\" he said. In a speech to the annual conference of the charities aid foundation, Mr Howard said: \"That means a climate in which taxes are kept low and enterprise is encouraged.\" Mr Howard has already promised to make the case for low taxes and aims to cut bills. But he has been careful not to commit himself to any specific tax reductions or any timescale for implementing them. He said he would not be drawn into making \"flashy promises\" about resolving the country's problems overnight. The new shadow chancellor, Oliver Letwin, yesterday also warned the Conservatives had no \"quick fix on tax\". He insisted the Tories could not make any specific guarantees because of the need to reform public services. The Conservatives had long believed low tax was a good thing, he said. And they would look \"when we can, to reduce the burden of tax over time\". But in an interview with the BBC, he added: \"I cannot give any kind of guarantee of a particular tax cut at a particular time partly because we absolutely have to get structural reform of the public services first. \"And partly because we have no idea what kind of fiscal books, what kind of tax and spending position, Gordon Brown is going to leave us with.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
