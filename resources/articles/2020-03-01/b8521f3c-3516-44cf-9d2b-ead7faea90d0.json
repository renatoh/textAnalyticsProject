Liverpool knew it was a possibility, however much they controlled this Champions League tie, however much they dominated in terms of possession and chances. While the margins remained slim, it could happen. It almost came at the end of normal time when Trent Alexander-Arnold conceded a needless free-kick and the unmarked Sa\u00fal \u00d1\u00edguez headed Renan Lodi\u2019s delivery past Adri\u00e1n. The Atl\u00e9tico celebrations ignited like a firecracker only to fade upon the sight of an offside flag against Sa\u00fal. Liverpool ought to have won this game several times over. They attacked in waves, battering Atl\u00e9tico, testing their resilience to the limit. The most influential player on the pitch was the visiting goalkeeper, Jan Oblak, who made a string of excellent saves. Diego Simeone, the Atl\u00e9tico manager, said afterwards that \u201cBarcelona have Messi but we have Oblak\u201d. Liverpool also blew fistfuls of chances, none more gilt-edged than the 67th-minute header that Andy Robertson crashed against the crossbar when gloriously placed. Klopp\u2019s team had led on the night through Gini Wijnaldum\u2019s header on 43 minutes and, early in the extra period, they finally got the goal that put them in front on aggregate. Wijnaldum was the creator, powering up the right flank to cross for Roberto Firmino, whose header hit the inside of the post. When the ball rebounded to him, he steered it into the other corner. Job done? Not at all. The sucker punch came when Adri\u00e1n accepted a back-pass from Alexander-Arnold and shanked his clearance low and straight to Jo\u00e3o Felix, who moved it to the substitute Marcos Llorente. The midfielder, who joined last summer from Real Madrid, is not noted for his goalscoring prowess but nobody would have known it. He took one touch to set himself before banging low into the bottom corner. Adri\u00e1n was extremely slow to get down and across. Llorente was not finished. At the end of the first period of extra time, he took a pass from another substitute, \u00c1lvaro Morata, as Atl\u00e9tico broke and, with Liverpool players backing off, he repeated the trick. Touch, shot, goal. Again, Adri\u00e1n was nowhere near to the shot and it was easy to imagine that Oblak or, more pertinently, Alisson \u2013 Liverpool\u2019s injured No 1 \u2013 would have done better. Liverpool were broken and Morata rubbed salt into their wounds by running through at the very end to score again. Simeone\u2019s joy knew no bounds. It has been a difficult season for him and his team on the domestic front, with them currently lagging in sixth in La Liga, 13 points behind the leaders, Barcelona. But here, they dug in for a famous win. They found a way. For Liverpool, it added up to a first home defeat in 18 months and a first ever European knockout reverse under Klopp. Most gallingly, they felt their grip loosen on the trophy that they had won last May, when they beat Tottenham at Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s stadium to enable them to add a sixth star to their shirts. They are set to secure a first Premier League trophy since 1990 in the coming days or weeks and, in time, that will feel like the most important detail of a phenomenal season. Here, there was only frustration. In the end, it was comfortable for Atl\u00e9tico but for the overwhelming majority of normal time, this was a siege, with Liverpool working the ball expertly and finding the spaces for first-time crosses. In total they racked up 34 attempts on goal and won 16 corners. Wijnaldum had an early headed sighter and Oblak was extended more and more as the first half wore on. He saved smartly from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Sadio Man\u00e9 while he showed good reactions to beat away an Alexander-Arnold cross that came through a crowd. In between times, Man\u00e9 saw a header blocked by Lodi. Wijnaldum\u2019s goal came when he held his run by the penalty spot and summoned power and accuracy in his header from Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s cross. The ball bounced down and seemed to pick up speed off the turf on its way in. Atl\u00e9tico were overrun in the second half and they had Oblak to thank for keeping them alive. His save to tip away a low Oxlade-Chamberlain effort from distance on 54 minutes, having snaked out a long arm, was of the highest order while his presence seemed to spook Firmino at the far post following a whipped Alexander-Arnold delivery. Felipe had glanced wide at the near post following a Koke corner on 18 minutes and Felix worked Adri\u00e1n on the break during the second half, the Liverpool goalkeeper rather fumbling the save and then diving to reach the loose ball ahead of \u00c1ngel Correa. But that was it from Atl\u00e9tico until Llorente drove the stunning turnaround and Klopp would not hide his anger at their defensive approach. Liverpool pressed on, with Robertson blowing his header and also shooting wastefully while Oblak denied Alexander-Arnold, Man\u00e9 was high with an overhead kick and Salah shot off-target. The script for Liverpool had called for another European comeback, with Klopp having presided over a few of those at this stadium. Atl\u00e9tico had not read it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
