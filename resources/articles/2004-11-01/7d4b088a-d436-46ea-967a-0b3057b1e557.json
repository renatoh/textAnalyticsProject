David Morley, 37, was attacked as he sat chatting to a friend early on October 30. He suffered a ruptured spleen, broken ribs and 40 bruises, and died in hospital later that day. Detectives are investigating whether he was killed because he was gay. At a public question and answer session on Thursday, Mr Livingstone alleged that two of those present when Mr Morley was attacked took pictures of the beating on mobile phones. Six youngsters have been charged with his murder, attempted assaults on two other men, in the same area and on the same night Mr Morley was attacked, and robbery from one of these men. They are in custody and due to appear at the Old Bailey next Monday. Mr Morley, who worked in the Birdcage bar in Chiswick, west London, survived the nail bombing attack on the Admiral Duncan pub in Soho which killed three people in 1999. The mayor, an active campaigner against homophobia, said he was working with the gay rights group Stonewall to educate children about gay and lesbian lifestyles. He said Stonewall was drawing up teaching aids to promote tolerance and planned a conference for London schools next year to help teachers tackle discrimination."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
