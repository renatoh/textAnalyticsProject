This was one-day cricket as we knew it a decade ago, with more modest scores and a role for the bowler. It made the runs of Yasir Hameed, man of the match for his cultured 98, shine all the more. Peshawar, disconcertingly close to those parts of the Afghan border where \"high-value targets\" are being hunted down, is rugged territory and so too was the pitch. In truth, it was the type of surface all of Pakistan, though perhaps not the sponsors, were hoping for. In the morning the ball rose and jagged, and once the long Shabbir Ahmed had located the square, he was virtually impossible to face. Twelve of the 33 runs he conceded came off his first over, which lasted 12 balls, after which he coolly seamed out India's top order. Sachin Tendulkar nicked a beauty, Virender Sehwag thick-edged one almost as good, and Laxman's dismissal - bowled, stuck at the crease - was inevitable for he had never the confidence to play forward against a bowler of this height. From 37 for three in the eighth over, the rebuilding started. Rahul Dravid glued the middle, playing the anchor in stands with Sourav Ganguly and Yuvraj Singh, who finished as top-scorer with 65. Yuvraj's was a typical innings: creative and strokeful under pressure. There was no more thrilling shot all day than his scudding, pirouetting six over fine leg off Shoaib Akhtar's low full toss. Shoaib and Mohammad Sami produced the type of bloodlust in the crowd only bowlers of their speed can but the last five overs bled 54 in the final touches of a solid revival to a total of 244. Twice during Pakistan's reply, at 65 for four and 173 for six, it seemed that India would take over the game. That second crunch point was the dismissal of the local hero Yasir, a young man of immense skill and patience and as accomplished as as any batsman in the world off the front foot through the off. As the stadium stood and slow-clapped him to his century, he fell, ironically, driving to point. A game of cat-and-mouse ensued, with Tendulkar bowling teasing leg-spinners with a slip, and nobody on the leg inside the circle. But he dropped a tough return chance from Abdul Razzaq with the score on 200, and from there the result was not in doubt. Moin Khan played an experienced hand alongside the brilliant Razzaq, whose 53 not out was yet another matchwinning innings from down the order. \u00b7 New Zealand's Scott Styris shone with the bat and Chris Martin with the ball as the hosts dominated every session of the second day of the second Test in Auckland, rattling along to 201 for three to trail South Africa by only 95. Styris hit 118 as he and Craig McMillan put on an undefeated 64 to edge his side to within sight of South Africa's total."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
