The local fire service has warned that devices should not be charged on potentially flammable surfaces. So where is it safe to charge them? Here, experts answer that and other electrical safety questions. Where is it safe to charge a phone? \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t tuck phones under pillows or charge them on bedding,\u201d says Paul Shaw, head of fire investigation at Staffordshire fire rescue. \u201cIt\u2019s called thermal runaway in the battery. It self-heats. It keeps going and going. A work surface or wooden side table are fine, because the battery won\u2019t output enough heat.\u201d Shaw adds that you should always use the charger that came with the phone. Phil Buckle, the chief executive at the charity Electrical Safety First, advises against charging devices overnight at all. \u201cWhen you go to bed, switch everything off.\u201d Is it safe to change a lightbulb if you don\u2019t know whether the light was on or not when the bulb blew? \u201cYes, as long as you don\u2019t stick your finger where the lightbulb should go,\u201d Shaw says. \u201cIf the bulb flickers, stop and turn the light off.\u201d Should you turn off or unplug all your plugs before you go out? Buckle turns off his toaster and kettle before he leaves the house. Shaw says his morning routine involves switching off everything that doesn\u2019t have a timer, including the tumble dryer, dishwasher and washing machine \u2013 but he adds that it is fine to leave on the fridge freezer, and anything with a digital clock. Is it dangerous to leave the power turned on if there\u2019s no plug in the socket? No. \u201cSockets are designed to just be there,\u201d Buckle says. Is it true that plastic socket-protectors are unsafe? \u201cIf people want to use them, there is no reason why they shouldn\u2019t \u2013 but there\u2019s no need to use them because our socket system is perfectly safe,\u201d says Buckle. Shaw explains that plastic protectors should have three pins and be CE-certified. If they have only one pin, don\u2019t use them: they activate the socket. Should you turn your TV off in a thunderstorm? \u201cI really don\u2019t see that as a risk and I\u2019ve never bothered to unplug my telly in a thunderstorm,\u201d Buckle says. If the toast gets stuck in the toaster, how is it safe to get it out? Turn off the plug, remove it, then use a broad-bladed plastic utensil such as a spatula to retrieve whatever you\u2019ve lost. What is your absolute electrical must-don\u2019t? \u201cDon\u2019t use electrical garden tools such as a lawnmower or hedge-trimmer without a residual current device,\u201d Buckle warns. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have one, cutting through the cable could be life-threatening. You can buy one to use on the socket you plug your mower into.\u201d Shaw advises checking whether your appliances have been recalled (in the UK, at registermyappliance.org.uk). \u201cDon\u2019t leave a washing machine, tumble drier or dishwasher going when you go to bed,\u201d he says. Dishwashers can have problems with control units and door switches; tumble driers with an inadequate seal can have lint or fluff blown directly on to the element. \u201cIf you\u2019re leaving your tumble dryer on, make sure you remain on the same floor. If you have concerns, fit an additional smoke alarm.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
