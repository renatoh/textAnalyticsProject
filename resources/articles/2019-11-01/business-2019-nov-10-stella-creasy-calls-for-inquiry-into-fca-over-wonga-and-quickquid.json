Wonga went bust last year after it was brought down by a deluge of compensation claims from customers sold high-cost loans. Last month, QuickQuid\u2019s parent, CashEuroNet UK, was placed in administration by its US owner after it refused to pay compensation claims, leaving more than 1 million customers facing financial uncertainty. The FCA, the financial services industry watchdog, investigated Wonga in 2014 and forced it to write off 330,000 loans worth \u00a3220m and compensate 45,000 other customers. In 2015, the FCA ordered CashEuroNet to write off more than 2,500 loans and refund about 1,500 people at a cost of \u00a31.7m. In both cases the FCA installed a \u201cskilled person\u201d at the companies in order to overhaul processes and make sure the companies stuck to its rules. But Creasy said the claims that brought the lenders down indicated their bad lending practices continued and the measures had not worked. Creasy has asked the Treasury minister John Glen and the FCA to release the skilled person\u2019s reports and assessment of the FCA\u2019s actions. Glen said it was not his job to tell the FCA what to do and Christopher Woolard, the FCA\u2019s strategy director, did not address Creasy\u2019s request in a follow-up letter. Creasy said: \u201cThe regulator was supposed to be keeping an eye on these people and we are now seeing these companies collapse. This is the second major payday loan company that has gone bust and there is a very good case for an investigation into what is going on here. They [the FCA] can\u2019t say they didn\u2019t know the problem was coming.\u201d Borrowers from the companies faced being chased by third-party debt collectors, while customers mis-sold high-interest loans are likely to be left out of pocket because their compensation will not be paid, Creasy said. A QuickQuid customer borrowing \u00a3250 loan for three and a half months was charged interest equal to an annual percentage rate of 1,300%. The Centre for Responsible Credit () thinktank said the failure of Wonga alone was severe enough to qualify as \u201cregulatory failure\u201d, triggering an investigation under the Financial Services Act. The FCA states that a consumer loss of \u00a330m is the minimum for triggering a public report and that \u00a3150m or more would be \u201csignificant for many types of consumers\u201d. Losses to consumers from Wonga are about \u00a3400m, the CfRC said. Damon Gibbons, CRC\u2019s director, said: \u201cIt\u2019s for the FCA to make a statement as to why they don\u2019t consider the regulatory failure test has been met and to justify that decision.\u201d If the FCA concludes the payday lenders do not meet the financial threshold for regulatory failure, the Treasury has the power to order an investigation in the public interest, Gibbons said. The FCA said it had clamped down on consumer credit since taking over regulation in 2014 and its actions had saved customers billions of pounds. \u201cWhere we\u2019ve seen issues, we have intervened and will continue to do so,\u201d it said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
