Two summers ago, Huot, then an experimental psychology student at Bristol University, spent his holiday as an intern at Bank of America, where he now works as an analyst. \"It was a very steep learning curve, I was working with live transactions and got a lot of exposure to senior bankers. But it was also a lot of fun; there were team-bonding sessions, including going rock climbing and problem-solving activities, lectures and social events,\" says Huot, 23. A summer internship has long been recognised as good route into a full-time job, but it's not a guarantee of being made an offer. City recruiters estimate that only around half to 60% of investment banking interns are subsequently hired. But if you're prepared to work hard and grab all the opportunities, it can nevertheless give you a real headstart. The key, explains Huot, is to recognise that an internship is as much about you getting to know your potential employer as vice versa. \"You need to get across that you have an appetite for this sort of career, an ability to learn quickly and that you are good at analysis,\" he says. \"It is also all about how you interact with the team; so they can trust you,\" In Huot's case there was a mid- and end-of-placement review, after which he was made an offer. \"It meant I was able to relax during my last year at university,\" he says, laughing. A good internship programme will normally have a structured evaluation process built into it, points out Zo\u00eb Gordon, graduate recruitment manager at law firm Allen &amp; Overy, which runs three summer internships, each lasting three weeks and taking around 25 students in their penultimate year. The key when being evaluated is to provide evidence, Gordon advises. So, if you say you are good at working as part of a team, you need to be able to give examples. \"People will be looking to find out about the skills you have developed and how this fits in with what they are looking for,\" she says. But even if you don't get an offer or if subsequently you decide the firm isn't for you, you will have gained valuable skills that you can take to another career or job interview. There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to turning an internship into a permanent position, stresses Cambridge law graduate Tara Rajah, 22, who spent three weeks with Allen &amp; Overy in the summer of 2004 and is now working for the law firm full-time. \"Act as you would think a trainee is expected to act,\" she explains. \"You need to be asking questions and showing you have a general interest in and understanding of law.\" Do not be afraid during the evaluation or interview process to sell yourself, says Christos Manolis, talent supply manager for the UK and Ireland at Procter &amp; Gamble. The consumer goods giant runs a 10- to 12-week summer internship programme each year from July to the middle of September. \"The interview is not a time to lie,\" Manolis says, \"but it is not a time to be modest either. Companies want to hear about what you have done or achieved.\" Any kind of work experience will normally stand you in good stead, but the intense experience of a summer internship can be particularly valuable wherever you have done it, agrees Liz Rhodes, director of the National Council for Work Experience. The key is to tread a tricky line between being a wallflower and coming across as some sort of irritating, pushy Apprentice-clone. \"It is important to be assertive, but in the nicest way possible. You need to be confident about putting forward your ideas and not afraid to ask questions,\" she explains."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
