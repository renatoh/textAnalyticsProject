Have a look at the Belongil Beach House - great hostel, bit of a walk along the beach but worth it for the fab cafe attached to it. You took my advice on dolphins so trust me on this one! It's also worth hiring a bike and cycling up to the lighthouse - requires a bit of effort but it is worth it as you may get to see whales coming up the coast. Byron rocks, and if you want to stay somewhere a bit off the wall try the Arts Factory. Also has a good outdoor cinema. Word of warning - don't learn to dive here, I tried and nearly drowned. They try and rush you through a three day course - it isn't long enough. enjoy. I'm very jealous. Keep the news coming.
