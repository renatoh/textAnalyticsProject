City's defeat in Barcelona on Wednesday followed being knocked out of the FA Cup by Wigan on Sunday and Tour\u00e9 admitted Chelsea, with a nine-point lead, were now favourites to win the Premier League. Manuel Pellegrini's team have three games in hand but are still to visit Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal as well as Everton \u2013 where they traditionally find it hard to win. Chelsea have the easier run-in, despite having to go to Anfield and facing Arsenal at Stamford Bridge, and Tour\u00e9 said it was wrong for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho to claim City were in the best position. \"Not at all,\" he said. \"Chelsea are nine points ahead. Yes, we have three games in hand but we could lose all three of them. Chelsea, for me, are the favourites.\" Tour\u00e9 said Mourinho ought to stop making public comments about rival teams. \"He is a coach and he must give respect a little bit,\" he told Marca. \"He is always talking about everyone and that is not the correct way. That is why Barcelona always beat Real Madrid when Mourinho was here. I think he talks more than before, perhaps because the English press likes it.\" Tour\u00e9 was asked whether it would constitute a failure if City, until recently talking openly about a possible quadruple, finished the season with nothing more. \"Why? Why would it be? We have already won a cup. You cannot say that. Football is a competition \u2013 only one team can win each of the trophies. \"Don't say we'd be failures when we've won something already. Now we want to win more but teams are desperate to beat us, so it's always tough. Teams are very motivated against us. You have to understand we are not a machine.\" City's next assignment is at Hull on Saturday. Vincent Kompany said after the 2-1 defeat in the Camp Nou that his side \"had nothing left in the tank\" and they are waiting to find out the seriousness of Sergio Ag\u00fcero's latest hamstring injury. \"The most important thing is that we will get more rest now, not playing three times a week,\" Tour\u00e9 said. \"We've been involved in so many competitions and it's so hard, with national teams as well. It's always so difficult. \"We have lost Ag\u00fcero again, who is always an important player for us. But everything is going to be easier for us now, with only the Premier League left, so I hope we can finish well. We know it's going to be difficult but with the players we have I still think we can do it.\" Ag\u00fcero was substituted at half-time against Barcelona and his absence would represent a significant setback for a team who have scored only eight times in the last eight games, losing four of them. \"Hopefully it's nothing serious,\" Pablo Zabaleta, who was sent off, said. \"He'll have scans to check if he's OK, so fingers crossed. We know how important he is for the team.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
