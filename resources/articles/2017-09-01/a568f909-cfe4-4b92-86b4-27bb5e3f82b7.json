If someone\u2019s bull terriers savaged a bull, it would be no good the owner pleading that the breed had been bred for bull-baiting and therefore there wasn\u2019t much he could do to stop them. He would be prosecuted and the dogs might well be destroyed. But hunts take out packs of 30-plus dogs that they state are uncontrollable and take them to coverts almost certain to contain foxes. So foxes get chased and killed and the hunts pretend they thought the hounds were on a non-existent \u201ctrail\u201d. I have been a hunt monitor for 23 years and have watched hundreds of hunts. I am convinced that trail hunting does not exist, but is a front for every hunt to continue hunting live quarry, a \u201ccynical subterfuge\u201d in the words of one unusually percipient judge. However, considering its fatuousness, this excuse is remarkably successful at repeatedly getting hunts out of trouble. The National Trust should bear in mind that a landowner allowing illegal hunting to take place can be prosecuted. If it succeeds in crushing the motion to ban all trail hunting on NT land, it will have placed itself in an invidious position. Penny Little Great Haseley Oxfordshire Last chance on climate change The extreme weather that has caused devastation in Florida, Houston, the Caribbean and south-east Asia is symptomatic of climate breakdown, which is happening as a result of global warming caused mainly by the burning of fossil fuels (\u201cSurvivors of Irma beg for aid\u201d, News). We have about 15 years to stabilise the atmosphere before climate breakdown becomes unstoppable. It will result in the failure of staple crops in tropical zones, floods, droughts, wars over land and resources such as clean water and chaotic, forced mass migration to temperate parts of the world. The maturing of the renewable energy industry and developments in smart grids and battery storage mean we have a chance to avert climate breakdown. The most effective action we can take is to switch to a 100% renewable energy supplier. Nuclear power is too expensive, too slow to build and too dangerous. Cumbria\u2019s police and crime commissioner recently described Sellafield as a big strategic target for terrorists. This applies to all nuclear power plants. The only sensible future is based on clean, safe, affordable and abundant renewable energy. Anne Dismorr Norwich Pay cap must be lifted for all I read with interest of the looming \u201cwinter of discontent\u201d (News). Living in a seaside resort with problems of deprivation, it beggared belief that universal credit was trialled here. I think the disingenuous premise was that if it could work here, it would work anywhere. But this led to severe problems for many. The chancellor cannot rule and divide between public sector workers. The removal of this unfair pay cap needs to apply to all. If this is achieved, we may begin to believe in the government\u2019s tarnished mantra of wanting a society that works for all. Judith A Daniels Great Yarmouth Bell Pottinger reined in too late As an addendum to Catherine Bennett\u2019s article (\u201cPR execs behaving badly\u2026, Comment), it is worth noting that during the Bell Pottinger scandal, the Public Relations and Communications Association did little or nothing to rein in the agency\u2019s shocking activities in South Africa, until its shamefully silent hand was forced. It is legitimate to ask who else within the PRCA membership is enjoying the comfort of a blind eye while they pursue similar immoral activities. Mike Abbott London W4 Library lives on \u2013 but only just Your review of Andy and Peter Holden\u2019s Natural Selection exhibition (\u201cBirds do it\u2026\u201d, New Review) talks of the \u201cformer Newington Library\u201d but the library still exists, housed in a metal container above a collection of takeaways rather than in the distinguished building purpose-built for it 125 years ago. Four years ago, a fire started in the neighbouring Cuming Museum and it and the library have been closed since. Southwark council said it would cost \u00a340m to make safe and yet a private art academy did so for \u00a330,000. In consultation, residents asked for a library \u2013 instead, they got this. Admirable as I\u2019m sure the exhibition is, it is under the shadow of the wider gentrification of the Elephant. Did the council deliberately come up with an unworkable figure? It has a good record on libraries. Clarity would be welcome. Toby Brundin London SE17 A tax on tax havens Mariana Mazzucato outlines an interesting viewpoint (\u201cAfter Irma, let those who use our tax havens contribute to the repairs\u201d, Comment) on modern inequality. Perhaps it is time for a Tobin tax, a levy on financial transactions, reinforced by a penal rate on all transactions involving tax havens. Paul Salt London W1"}, "isHosted": false}}}
