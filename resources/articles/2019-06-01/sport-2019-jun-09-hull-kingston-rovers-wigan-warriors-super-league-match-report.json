At one stage it looked as though Hull KR would be four points clear of bottom-placed London by full time. Around 15 minutes later the Broncos had stunned the league leaders St Helens in Ealing and the Robins had capitulated here against the champions, putting both sides level on 10 points at the bottom \u2013 and there is surely no doubting now that Rovers are entrenched in the most unlikely of relegation battles. In pre-season nobody had given Broncos a chance of avoiding the drop on their first season back in Super League \u2013 some even doubted whether they had the credentials to win a game. But, with five victories under their belt, their surprise win in the capital compounded the misery of Hull KR fans here, who were left to rue another frustrating afternoon. Such was the drama of this game \u2013 settled by Sam Powell\u2019s magnificent long\u2011range drop goal two minutes from time \u2013 that it was easy to forget this was Tony Smith\u2019s first game in charge, having been appointed Hull KR coach on Thursday. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to work with,\u201d was his upbeat reflection post-match. Games of this magnitude are so often decided by fine margins, as Powell\u2019s decisive one-pointer proved. But with the game level at 18-18 in the final moments it looked as though Chris Atkin had scored the match\u2011winning try \u2013 before it was disallowed by the referee Scott Mikalauskas. \u201cI\u2019d like to have seen a video referee here because that can make a difference,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019ve looked at the video and thought it was good. That\u2019s how seasons can be defined.\u201d Smith\u2019s frustrations will matter little to Wigan, though. This has been arguably one of the worst defences of a Super League title, but with victories as narrow as these, perhaps the tide is slowly starting to turn for the Warriors. \u201cSpecial moments like this can turn seasons around,\u201d the Wigan coach, Adrian Lam, said. Had the Warriors lost here, the Broncos\u2019 victory would have plunged Wigan further into trouble at the bottom, but such is the congested nature of the competition that the Warriors are now just two wins shy of the playoffs. \u201cWe play the teams in front of us over the next month and we can run them down,\u201d Lam said. There will have to be further improvement from Wigan for that to be the case, though. The Warriors led 14-6 at half-time here with tries from George Williams, Dan Sarginson and Joe Burgess, and they looked well placed to kick on. Perhaps the Wigan side who won the title last season would have done. However, the withdrawal of Zak Hardaker with a hamstring injury stunted Wigan\u2019s rhythm, and to Hull KR\u2019s credit they were much improved after the break. Within three minutes of the restart Will Dagger had narrowed the deficit, before Ryan Lannon\u2019s superb finish on 54 minutes put the Robins ahead for the first time. By now, news of Broncos\u2019 heroics against St Helens in the capital was beginning to filter through, and that heightened the tension even further \u2013 as did Liam Marshall\u2019s try with 14 minutes remaining, levelling the scores at 18-18. Both sides had tries disallowed in the final minutes before, with two minutes remaining, Powell stepped out of the pocket to kick a remarkable long-range drop goal. \u201cAmazing,\u201d was Lam\u2019s description of the match\u2011winning moment. He was not wrong \u2013 but the reaction of the Hull KR players at full time, when they slumped to their knees, underlined just how significant an afternoon this could turn out to be. A change of coach perhaps, but the Robins\u2019 luck remains the same. If that does not change soon, this could be a season that ends in disaster."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
