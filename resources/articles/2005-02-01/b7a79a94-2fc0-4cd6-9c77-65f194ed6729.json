The nurses' professional body, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), said the idea was poorly thought out and unworkable, while the health workers' union Unison said it was \"half-baked\". The Conservative idea is that the matron would be employed by the NHS rather than the individual hospital trust, and would take overall responsibility for ensuring that wards were free of the hospital superbug MRSA. The manifesto promised that creating cleaner infection-free hospitals would be a priority if the party were to win the next general election. Hospital local inspection teams, working with the matron, would have the power to \"search and destroy\" the superbug, and would have the final say in whether a ward should close, according to the manifesto. It promised: \"We will bring back matrons to take charge and deliver clean and infection-free wards.\" But the Conservatives' solution to creating clean wards was too simplistic, according to Geraldine Cunningham, the acting director of the RCN Institute, which is devoted to nurses' education and development. She said: \"You can stop a ward admitting more patients, but you can't close a ward because if you moved the patients the infection would spread through the hospital. That means you would have to keep the patients on the ward until it was infection-free which would cause quite a lot of distress. \"It's not really putting the best interest of the patients at heart because they want to feel they are in a secure environment. The answer is to be more proactive and make sure that the infection doesn't happen in the first place.\" The RCN's solution to improving infection control in hospitals is to take a team approach, rather than the responsibility being down to one person. Ms Cunningham said: \"It shouldn't be just about one individual, but it should be about making sure that hospitals have the staff and the resources to keep wards clean and do it as a team.\" The RCN has recently launched a joint programme with the Department of Health to look at membership of a hospital team to fight MRSA which would include cleaning staff, clinicians responsible for infection control as well as facilities managers. The nurses' union is also concerned that giving matrons the power to overrule a hospital chief executive would be confrontational. Ms Cunningham said: \"It's not in the interest of either the matron or the chief executive who should be working in partnership. If you want to give matrons the power to overrule chief executives then make the matrons the chief executive and give them a chief executive's salary.\" Dave Prentis, the general secretary of Unison, said the manifesto idea was both \"unworkable\" and \"half-baked\". He said: \"It was the Tories that let the superbugs loose into our hospital wards by cutting and privatising cleaning services. Matrons might do a good job, but they are not miracle workers and you can't clean wards without cleaners. Thanks to the Tories we now have half the cleaners in the NHS than we had 20 years ago.\" A spokeswoman for the Conservative party explained the thinking behind the proposal. She said the matron would be employed \"centrally\" by the NHS rather than the individual trust to \"ease the issue of authority so that the matrons don't get the sack if they overrule managers\". She denied the idea was unworkable and said patients on an infected ward would be kept in isolation units until the infection had cleared. \"We would then clean the ward once they had left,\" she said. The NHS Confederation, which represents trusts, expressed \"serious concerns\" about the Conservative proposals to combat MRSA. Its chief executive, Dr Gill Morgan, said: \"Reducing hospital acquired infections is already a top priority for hospital managers. We are confident that NHS trusts can be trusted to act responsibly by shutting wards that are affected by such infections.\" She said it was \"grossly unfair\" that the manifesto accused NHS managers and clinicians \"of chasing government targets at the expense of safe patient care\". But she said the confederation wanted to \"see more flesh on the bones\" of these proposals before making a more detailed comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
