You could hear presenter Mike Williams's mind boggle at the idea of this hobby and his words went a bit wobbly momentarily too. \"Whugh, why?\" he asked. \"It seems such a silly thing to do.\" He also reeled from the storm chaser's assertion that climate change, if you're into storms, is \"happy news\". Williams is a dogged interviewer, and he doesn't do ice-breaking chit-chat. Faced with an executive from an insurance company that proclaims itself sensitive to environmental issues, he was in full flow. \"Is it greenwash or do you give a damn?\" he snapped. \"You get to win both ways, don't you?\" he prodded. \"Insurance is a game for the wealthy west, isn't it?\" he observed. One Planet is a brisk, likable listen, with its occasional features \u2013 yesterday's Reason to be Cheerful spot, about dwindling demand for energy, wasn't that cheerful, Williams conceded, as it was largely due to the recession \u2013 and weekly update on its carbon footprint. There was a fascinating report from Cuba, too, on how organised the island is for storm evacuation. Evacuees are allowed to take their belongings (\"refrigerators, televisions and your pets\"), so nobody refuses to leave, and nobody is looted while they're away."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
