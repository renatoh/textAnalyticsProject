As investors, the other dragons and I need to be convinced not only that the person asking for our money has a sound understanding of business, but also that they have entrepreneurial flair. All too often, the people entering the den seem to be high-calibre individuals who demonstrate excellent business knowledge but lack the skills required to turn their ideas into success stories. The same goes for graduates and schoolleavers. Many young people entering the labour market do not seem to have the entrepreneurial skill-set needed by most employers. Up until now, we have simply not done enough to unlock the entrepreneurial talents of our young people. Traditional business courses equip students with valuable theoretical business knowledge, but in the UK there is no consistent provision of enterprise education. This matters because enterprise and entrepreneurship drive economic growth. Enterprise and entrepreneurship are key skills upon which future growth and expansion are predicated. Yet they have not enjoyed the same billing as traditional subjects. I suspect there has been an image problem; a gap between people's perceptions and the reality. For too long, enterprise has been defined in quite narrow terms \u2013 a vague notion of business start-ups. This definition has confined the study of the subject to the fringes \u2013 a kind of strange novelty, or a bolt-on to other subjects. Entrepreneurs are not born, they are made. The key skills needed can and should be taught. And what's more, I can prove it. In January this year, 28 students were recruited to join the National Enterprise Academy Pathfinder pilot programme \u2013 an intensive six-month programme designed to develop, shape and test the UK's first-ever qualification dedicated solely to enterprise and entrepreneurship. The results of the pilot are outstanding. Several graduates have already established their own businesses, while almost half of the students have opted to stay on at the NEA to further hone their talents. I've offered some of them positions across my own portfolio of businesses. We have also been working in partnership with Edexcel, the UK's largest qualifications awarding body, to develop two unique qualifications, a level 2 BTec diploma in understanding enterprise and entrepreneurship, and the level 3 BTec diploma in enterprise and entrepreneurship. Both qualifications will be available to 16- to 19-year-olds from this September at the NEA's enterprise centres in Buckinghamshire and Manchester. They are also available to any college or school that would like to offer them. Business studies courses at GSCE and A-level tend to rely on a more traditional approach to learning \u2013 heavily focused on the theory of business and delivered through textbooks in a classroom environment. This approach, while extremely valuable, cannot replicate the \"real life\" business world. The new qualifications capture will expose students to real-life issues in real business environments, enabling them to develop the entrepreneurial mindset and self-confidence that are so vital. At level 2, students will hone their skills on live business challenges in established companies, as well as developing an investment-ready business plan for their own individual business idea. Then, at level 3, students will take this a step further, developing their learning through setting up and running their own microbusiness. There will be a high level of input from successful executives, who will support experienced teachers by acting as coaches and mentors to the students. The NEA hopes to see 18,000 learners benefit from the courses in the next five years, and will be working with FE providers and secondary teachers. But for the future of this country, more primary school children need to be taught business skills. What I would really like is for more primary teachers to show their students the excitement and fun of turning their ideas into successes. By the time our seven-year-olds are ready to enter the Dragons' Den, let's hope we can confidently claim to be the most enterprising nation in the world."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
