There were two huddles at the Film Four party last week. The first centred on Andy Duncan, Channel 4's new chief executive. He was followed around the room so closely by a circle of admirers he must have been reluctant to go to the gents. The second gathered around another blonde-haired media figure - no, not Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson (holding court at the ground-floor bar), but Donna Air, the former Byker Grove star. Air was in Edinburgh to promote her new film. No prizes for guessing who got the most attention from the army of luvvies. Johnson is not backward in coming forward, and he was quick to complain about a recent Sunday Express story illustrated by a picture of him and his girlfriend. Nothing wrong with the story you understand, but the picture in question depicted him with an ex - and that did not go down too well with Mrs Johnson, whom the Channel 4 chairman married this summer. Deals on meals Spotted at Friday night's post-MacTaggart Lecture party: ITV chief executive Charles Allen (below), casually attired in a brown leather jacket, deep in conversation with Scottish Media Group boss Andrew Flanagan. No doubt they were hammering out the terms of a complex asset swap that will allow ITV to take full control of GMTV, in which SMG has a minority stake. Either that, or they were complaining about the mushroom vol-au-vents. John's TV hell John Humphrys was still in a sombre mood following his grumpy MacTaggart lecture, telling anyone within earshot about his hellish session of self-imposed TV viewing. Humphrys apparently doesn't own a telly, and spent the last five months viewing videos in preparation for his speech.'I'd rather read a book,' he said. Or listen to the radio, presumably. Working holiday If you thought the docusoap was dead, think again. Rumour has it that Channel 4 is close to commissioning a fly-on-the-wall series set in the Bahamas. That is causing much excitement among the broadcaster's executives, who are busy dreaming up excuses to visit the set. Baptism of fire Away from Edinburgh, diary hears that Associated Newspapers' new managing director Kevin Beatty had an interesting childhood. Beatty, who replaces Murdoch MacLennan, was born in Glasgow, but his parents decided it wasn't the place to raise children and moved - to Belfast. Still it's all good training for the in-fighting at Northcliffe House."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
