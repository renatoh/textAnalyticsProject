In his speech on civil liberties last week, Gordon Brown, the prime minister, said: \"Public information does not belong to government, it belongs to the public on whose behalf government is conducted.\" Brown's speech acknowledged the power of the web to give access to information about public services. \"The availability of real-time data about what is happening on the ground - whether about local policing or local health services - is vital in enabling people to make informed choices about how they use their local services and the standards they expect.\" Brown is also considering opening new parts of the government's digital archives. A committee headed by Paul Dacre, editor-in-chief of Associated Newspapers, is to consider relaxing the rule under which government records do not become public documents in the care of the National Archives until 30 years have passed. It will report by the middle of next year. The National Archives welcomed the review, saying it \"may have significant implications for citizens' access to information, as any changes may lead to the speeding up of access to many records\". However, the prime minister did not mention how his enthusiasm for allowing citizens access to data squares with the policy of encouraging some publicly-owned bodies to charge for data sets, especially for re-use in web mashups and other products. But Locus, a trade association, welcomed the speech. \"Next time we hope he will focus on re-use,\" it said. We agree. Over the past 18 months, our Free Our Data campaign has argued that the government should stop attempting to trade in information, but instead make its unrefined data (except where it threatens privacy or national security) freely available to all comers. Later this month, an independent review commissioned by the Treasury will report on the costs and benefits of the current \"trading fund\" model. In the meantime, our campaign continues to receive evidence of harmful consequences of public agencies trying to make money out of their information. One such consequence is a threat to the next national census, in 2011, because of inaccurate databases of addresses. According to the Office for National Statistics, neither of two rival address registers, one owned by local government, the other by Ordnance Survey, was accurate enough to ensure that a census form goes to every household in Britain. \"Neither register met the needs of the census on coverage, classification and positional accuracy,\" ONS said. The shortcomings of national address registers are well known in government: over the past seven years, there have been several abortive attempts to create a single list. All foundered because of the difficulty of getting one arm of government to agree terms to use information produced by another. A convincing case, we think, for free data. \u00b7 Join the debate at the Free Our Data blog: freeourdata.org.uk/blog"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
