One of Tatler\u2019s best-selling issues featured a corgi on the cover. This is not just a window into the curious mind of the Tatler reader, but an explanation for why their style advice often features lines such as: \u201cThe Whippet has over taken the pug as the chic dog de jour,\u201d and why every editorial meeting seem to include mention of a dog \u2013 \u201cWhat is Tatler porn? Is it labradors gamboling?\u201d \u2013 and why there is also a dog in the office. All of which brings up terrible memories of the events of 2013, when Alan TBH Plumptre, Tatler\u2019s staff daschund, met an unsightly end in a revolving door. RIP, Alan. 2) \u201cThe wrong choice of tweed on a Tuesday afternoon is epically terrible\u201d, comments one Tatler employee, in a way that makes it impossible to discern where his tongue lies in relation to his cheek. That\u2019s the thing about Tatler, when you think they must be joking, they\u2019re not, and vice versa. 3) Editor Kate Reardon describes herself as a \u201chonking great Sloane\u201d. To paraphrase a line from The Big Lebowski, that\u2019s a name no one would self-apply \u2013 except at Tatler. 4) The hair mood board at Tatler, like the mood board for just about everything else at the magazine, is pretty much the Kate Middleton blowdry. 5) Posh people never really believe they\u2019re posh. The reasons are obscure: commissioning editor Matthew Bell can\u2019t be posh because he\u2019s \u201chalf foreign\u201d, for example. 6) As befitting a publication that hands out copies of Debrett\u2019s Guide to Etiquette and Modern Manners to new staff members, their resident pap Hugo Bernund, instead of upskirt shots of Lily Allen, enthusiastically snaps Jilly Cooper at polo matches. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our Hollywood A-lister, we\u2019ve got our journalist, we\u2019ve got our celebrity writer,\u201d he says, running through a checklist of what\u2019s needed for the Tatler pages \u2013 or perhaps the worst party of all time. 7) Aristos are in big trouble. As staff photographer Amelia Toubridge explains, aristos actually have to work these days. \u201cThey aren\u2019t sitting around just reading wonderful books and playing piano all day, which is what they were doing 100 years ago.\u201d As a result, Tatler organises a feature on poundshops, where one staff member discovers the joys of a shop where everything is a pound: \u201cIf people knew what was here it would be absolutely stuffed to the rafters.\u201d 8) There\u2019s actually someone on the Tatler staff called Sophia Money-Coutts (pronounced Saphia, obvs). As the mag\u2019s staff list says, \u201cSophia Money-Coutts is a real person, not a made-up character\u201d. 9) Tailcoats for the Bullingdon club are rumoured to cost \u00a33,500 and are made at Savile Row tailors Ede and Ravenscroft, as Bell discovers when he does a feature about the secretive club for rich tossers who will one day run the country. 10) \u201cPrint isn\u2019t dead, it just means you need to get more creative,\u201d says one staffer, which for Tatler means giving away a paper doll of Kate Middleton which you can dress in its own Delpozo gown. Another Tatler editor notes that the Duchess of Cambridge is smart because she manages to avoid eye contact with cameras at all times, making it impossible for any magazine to ever run a picture of her on the cover that looks anything other than incidental. By Tatler standards, this is practically punk."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
