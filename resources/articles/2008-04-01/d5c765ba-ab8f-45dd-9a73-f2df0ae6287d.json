You can practically hear it coursing towards the end of every branch and on into the twigs to flesh out buds that have been tightly sealed for five months. The scales protecting these buds litter the ground under beech trees and remind you to look up to where the action is. A beech wood is my favourite place to go at precisely this moment, not just to catch the violet wave of bluebells but also to soak in the intense and luminous greens. The colour is magnified, with one branch layered upon the next, filtering the spring sunshine from way up in the canopy with the grandeur of a cathedral. The fresh green of spring is like a high that I find myself chasing. I want more and I want to be consumed by the deluge of newness that comes with it. When it dulls, as it does when the leaves lose their newborn tenderness, I invariably feel I have missed out, not had or made the time to soak up every racing moment. In my own garden this feeling is heightened by the fact that my experience is finite, as I am literally fenced in. After the pleated foliage on the hornbeam fills out like the lungs on a squeezebox and the neon intensity of fresh box and Smyrnium perfoliatum darkens, I cannot help but feel a little anticlimax. Last year I made a few adjustments to give the illusion that the greening process lasted longer: I did this with the introduction of foliage that has a yellow cast. With anything artificial, you have to go the whole hog and turn your back on the natural order of things, or take the lead from nature and imagine you are heightening a natural phenomenon: the shaft of light punching through a dark canopy giving the illusion that its target has been brightened, or the dappling that comes with new growth in a mixed hedgerow, one green lighter and brighter than the next. I play with greens as a foundation in the garden, but I am generally wary of yellow foliage, for it can be overbearing or simply too constant. In reality, foliage that appears to be illuminated dulls when the light changes, and I like yellow foliage to do much the same, to have its moment or its season. Garden centres do not agree, and will try to sell the artificial sunshine of a Choisya 'Sundance' by printing up a label almost as big as the plant, emblazoned with golden foliage. The labelling sticks out a mile, and so will the plant in your garden if you put it in the wrong position. Give it pride of place in the sun and it will act the performer, but put it in a little shade and it will dapple dark corners mysteriously. Many plants with yellow foliage also have a horrible way of burning out in the heat of the sunshine. 'Sundance' fries along the edges of the leaf, as does the golden hop Humulus lupulus 'Aureus' if it is put on a sunny fence or a pergola. This beautiful plant, a selection of our native hedgerow hop, also bleaches to a pale, insipid yellow, but keep it in the shade and it retains its new-looking lemony tone. I plant it in a position that manages to dodge the heat of the day, as it takes a little shade, being happiest in hedgerow. Twine it through laciniated elders or weave it through a dark holly hedge to give the impression of sunshine where sunshine might not fall. Bar the likes of the dangerously variegated Elaeagnus angustifolia 'Maculata Aurea' and Mediterranean golden thyme, most yellow foliage prefers cool conditions. This is often just where you need the light. Interplant the simplicity of the plain-leaved yellow dogwood Cornus alba 'Aurea' with the dull slate-grey flowers of Geranium phaeum and the darkness of the Mourning Widow will be given the contrast it needs. This cornus is much the better cousin of 'Spaethii', the form with green and yellow variegation, as it has a calmness to it that doesn't confuse the issue. Of the shrubs that let me paint in light, Acer japonicum 'Aureum' actively needs the shade not to burn. I love this little tree and it is wonderful in a pot if you need a lift in a dingy courtyard. Philadelphus coronarius 'Aureus' is another zesty addition, its bright lemony foliage dulling a little once the season kicks in, but not before the white sprays of scented blossom are over. It forms an elegant, more open bush in loose woodland and will never register as the blob of yellow that it might out in the sun. The same goes for the yellow-leaved form of the common elder, Sambucus nigra 'Aurea', and Ribes sanguineum 'Brocklebankii'. Too much sun and this flowering currant produces too much flower. A smattering of cherry pink is all you need. Where I have less room for shrubs in my own garden I have underplanted the dark red of my Paeonia delavayi with a new addition, Dicentra spectabilis 'Gold Heart'. This was selected by Nori Pope at Hadspen Gardens, and I admired the light it gave off. I grew the plant for the first time last year - it has only been available in nurseries since the late Nineties - but it was worth the experiment. In late March the unfurling growth is a brilliant yellow-green, and although the pink of the bleeding hearts might seem strange as a combination, in the chaos of spring it is fun. The colour evens out to a soft, refreshing emerald to allow other plants around it to take the stage as summer progresses. I have it teamed with 'Bowles Golden Grass' (Milium effusum 'Aureum') and I plan to add a smattering of golden feverfew (Chrysanthemum parthenium 'Aureum') and the yellow-leaved Filipendula ulmaria 'Aurea'. I'll temper them all with the darker greens to keep them from taking over, but I can see already that their addition to the season is one that will help to fuel my desires. dan.pearson@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
