The hotly contested argument has divided the 2020 campaign trail too, as a slew of Democratic candidates, including Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have joined the impeachment movement, while frontrunner Joe Biden has resisted the push. But at a key pit stop on the 2020 trail \u2013 where a number of top candidates, including Biden and former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke were pitching Democratic activists for their support \u2013 the impeachment debate was far from the surface. Instead, among the hundreds of mostly African American Democrats at the I Will Vote gala fundraiser in Atlanta, the talk was about far more conventional topics than impeaching the president. For the most part, the attendees who spoke to the Guardian said they wanted to discuss getting out the vote and the issues they saw as the most important: healthcare rights, voting rights and reproductive rights. Loretta Perry said she didn\u2019t even want to speak about impeachment. She paused before saying: \u201cIf you look at impeachment, it\u2019s like, what is the next option after impeachment? \u201c She was referring to the socially conservative vice-president, Mike Pence. \u201cThat\u2019s not good, either.\u201d She emphasized that the candidates\u2019 words on impeachment were not shaping her decision on the Democratic nominee, 17 months before election day. For Perry, the single most important issue was the conversation around abortion rights, especially in Georgia. Robyn Donaldson, another attendee from Atlanta, saw Biden as one of her top choices, even though she supports impeachment and he does not. The impeachment issue was simply not the dominant factor for her, she said. \u201c[Biden\u2019s] been in the White House, he\u2019s been [vice-president] and he\u2019s connected to the everyday voter,\u201d she explained. Her support for him had nothing to do with Biden\u2019s stance on impeachment, she said, pointing out he has called the conversation around it a \u201cdistraction\u201d. Donaldson said she worried about whether the conversation around impeachment \u201cwill end up being used as a political tool\u201d, just as Biden as warned. Her friend, Kemi Hawkins, walked up to the table and interjected: \u201cOh, I\u2019m a Joey B fan!\u201d when she heard Biden\u2019s name. But she made a face when catching up to the impeachment conversation. \u201cI\u2019m a little on the \u2018eh\u2019 side. I\u2019m just like: \u2018Get [Trump] out of here!\u2019\u201d she added. When discussing who they might back to be the nominee in 2020, many attendees were undecided. Almeta Cooper sipped red wine in the reception area and voiced a common refrain among her fellow attendees. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early to say who you want to be for,\u201d she said. Cooper, a lawyer focusing on healthcare in Georgia, said her ideal candidate has to align with her beliefs on reproductive rights for women, especially women of color, in light of the six-week abortion ban law endorsed by Georgia\u2019s Republican governor Brian Kemp. Cooper did not mention Biden but emphasized: \u201cIt has to be a candidate who can be successful.\u201d She added: \u201cAnd that candidate has to align with my beliefs.\u201d That sentiment was repeated among a number of attendees, many of whom who had paid at least $1,000 a plate at the high-powered gathering to hear from the likes of Biden. Biden too did not mention impeachment \u2013 nor did any other speaker. Instead it was abortion rights that made headlines. Biden had voiced his support for the Hyde amendment, a 40-year-old provision banning the federal government from paying for abortion care through Medicaid. That had earned himself a wave of negative headlines, and criticism from his rivals. Moments after Cooper took her seat, Biden took the stage to Aretha Franklin\u2019s Respect, announcing he had something important to tell the gathered crowd. \u201cWomen\u2019s rights and women\u2019s health are under assault like we haven\u2019t seen in the last 50 years,\u201d he began before saying he could no longer support the amendment. A loud cheer went up through the crowd. When Biden mentioned voting rights and promised to deal with voter suppression it got an even louder cheer from the crowd. What he did not mention once in his 30-minute speech was impeachment. Instead, Biden focused on economic inequality for black people, lack of access to education, criminal justice, healthcare and voter suppression in the south. One of the only direct references he made to Trump, like many of the attendees, was to say \u201cBeat Donald Trump!\u201d towards the end of his speech. In the same vein, many of the speakers, including Stacey Abrams, the Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate who lost to Kemp by a narrow margin after alleging voter suppression, focused on expanding voting rights. Though nearly 10 other speakers were slated to speak after Biden, some of the attendees sneaked out of the dining room as the Rev Al Sharpton took the stage, heading for dessert and cocktails. Ramon Montgomery reflected on what he had heard. The field seemed pretty even to him right now. \u201cWe know more about Joe Biden than anyone else,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cBut at the same time Bernie Sanders is a strong candidate and there are a lot of strong female candidates as well.\u201d When asked about the impeachment conversation in Washington, Montgomery sighed. He said: \u201cI think impeachment at this point is going to be a long, drawn-out process, so is it really necessary if we\u2019re going to beat them at the polls?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
