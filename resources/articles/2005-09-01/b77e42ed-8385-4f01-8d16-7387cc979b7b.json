Tues-Sat, noon-2pm, 5.30-9pm (5-9pm, Fri &amp; Sat) Small, immaculately clean shop and very organised staff. Choice menu, both restaurant and takeaway. A variety of moist fish in a light, crisp batter straight out of the fryer and probed before wrapping. Firm, chunky chips with soft centres and not a trace of grease. We ate every scrap without feeling pogged. Take a table in the small dining room or sit on the seafront watching the boats. D Clarke Bovey Tracey, Devon The Fish Shed Darts Farm Village, Topsham, Exeter, 01392 878206. Tues-Sat, 11.30am-2.30pm, 5.30-8.30pm (evenings, takeaway only) Big, juicy scallops on the griddle; white, flaky cod in crisp beer batter; mussels steamed in white wine; or a lobster caught that morning - all served with crisp chips, mushy peas or green salad. Salt and vinegar is available, but here's a surprise: also on offer are mayo, rouille, pesto. Blimey, are we in England, or have we been dreaming and conjured up some sort of ideal chippie? Around \u00a35-\u00a310, depending on fish. Eat in or take away. Trish Colvill Hollocombe, Devon Polsloe Bridge Fish and Chips 191 The Flat, Pinhoe Road, Exeter, 01392 271547. Mon-Sat, noon-2pm, 5-10pm It's the incidentals that often give a good clue as to the quality of food at takeaways. Here, the staff wear white hats and coats, and there's a wall full of certificates. The batter crunches, leaving no residual oil slick on the tongue, the chips stay crisp even after the 10-minute drive home, and they deliver on the portion/price equation. William Gallois Exeter, Devon The Beer Fish &amp; Chip Shop Fore Street, Beer, near Seaton, 01297 625774. Mon-Sun, noon-9pm There are many ways to spend a fiver, but few involve consuming a favourite national dish with the eye-candy of East Devon's coastline. People don't queue here for the good of their health. Instead, you partake of cod and chips twice, with extra salt, please. Eat in, but preferably take away, about 100 yards downwind to a bench. Unwrap your parcel and with one hand crack into the golden batter while with the other fending off unwanted advances towards your prized chips. Vicky Sartain Exmouth, Devon Hanbury's Restaurant Princes Street, Babbacombe, Torquay, 01803 314616. Mon-Sat, noon-1.45pm, 5.30-9.30pm Hanbury's is part of Saturday's football ritual. Gleaming surfaces, award-emblazoned walls, friendly staff. Refusing the bait of smoked haddock, skate and sole, I'll order cod and chips - very reasonable at \u00a34.45 - and wait. Everything is cooked to order. That's the secret. That, and quality ingredients: North Atlantic cod frozen at sea, Maris Piper potatoes, all fried in groundnut oil. Result: a golden feast. Chips crisp to the bite, fish full of flavour. And what better way to savour it than enjoying sea views from Babbacombe Downs. Then on to Plainmoor. If only United's results were as consistently excellent... Dave Martin Dorchester, Dorset \u00b7 Send us a 100-word review of a favourite restaurant, be it a regular haunt or a once-a-year treat.
