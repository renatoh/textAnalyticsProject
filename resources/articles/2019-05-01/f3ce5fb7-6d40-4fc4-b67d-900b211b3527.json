Northumbria police said 22 supporters were ejected from the ground and seven arrests made on a night when fighting in the stands spilled over into nearby streets. In ugly scenes outside the stadium a group of home fans clashed with Liverpool counterparts as they boarded a coach taking them back to Merseyside, forcing baton-wielding police to intervene. Earlier, security staff inside the stadium had struggled to control Liverpool fans who infiltrated home seating areas. Scuffles erupted in and around the hospitality areas and executive boxes high in the main Milburn Stand when what appeared to be a couple of dozen Liverpool fans openly celebrated the away team\u2019s goals and raised all sorts of questions about the wisdom of 7.45pm Saturday-night kick-offs. In a statement Newcastle United on Sunday night said: \u201cUnfortunately, despite restricting match ticket sales to existing members and reminding fans that visiting supporters were not permitted in home areas, a number of Liverpool fans did obtain and use tickets initially held by Newcastle United fans. We can confirm that standard tickets were only sold by the club to existing Newcastle United members and no general admission tickets were sold to Liverpool supporters by Newcastle United beyond the visitors\u2019 usual allocation. \u201cAs is policy for all matches, supporters of both home and away clubs are welcome in hospitality areas at St James\u2019 Park. However, club colours are prohibited and guests supporting the visiting club are asked to behave appropriately or risk facing ejection. The safety and security of all supporters is of paramount importance and club stewards, with the support of the police, did endeavour to eject any visiting fans from home and hospitality areas when outbreaks of disorder did regrettably occur. \u201cWe can confirm that 22 individuals were ejected from St James\u2019 Park on Saturday evening, with seven arrests made. We will be reviewing supporter feedback and CCTV and we will be taking action against any supporter who sold or passed on tickets to Liverpool fans.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
