But now it\u2019s time for the first of the 2020 DNC presidential primary debates! My colleague Adam Gabbatt is in Miami and will have all the updates you could possibly need. Follow along on the live blog here: Seriously, is every 2020 Democratic presidential candidate visiting the Homestead facility? With just minutes to go to the first of the Democratic primary debates, President Trump has begun tweeting up a storm. Immediately after his tweets about impeachment and Robert Mueller, the president moved right on to immigration. It\u2019s almost as if he doesn\u2019t want you to pay attention to something. Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper responds to his earlier rough start to tonight\u2019s debate: The happening place to be? The political celebrity sightings have begun. Andrew Gillum, the progressive from Tallahassee who almost won the red state Florida governor\u2019s mansion for the Democrats, is spotted down the street. Before the debate tonight, take a look at what some of the Democratic candidates had to say about the heartbreaking image of the drowned migrant father and daughter at the US-Mexico border: On the lighter side of congressional news, transportation committee members raced scooters on capitol hill today. Hey all, Vivian Ho here for a SUPER BRIEF live blog before the first of the Democratic primary debates. Hope everyone\u2019s jazzed. With that I bid you a good afternoon, as Vivian Ho comes on board to take you through the rest of the day until our Adam Gabbatt fires up late live blog coverage of the Democratic primary debate from south Florida tonight. Here are a few key things you may have missed today: The House and Senate have both passed bills which provide in the neighborhood of $4.5bn in funding to address the crisis on the border, but it\u2019s unclear how lawmakers expect to square the competing proposals. A Buzzfeed News investigation found that US investigators have found dismal conditions at migrant camps, similar to the ones that have been described in recent news accounts. More or less the whole Democratic field of contenders took trips to a detention camp in south Florida Wednesday ahead of this evening\u2019s debate. Two Republican Senators have come out and said that new rape claims against Donald Trump should be investigated. Also, Donald Trump (surprise, surprise) made a laundry list of off-color and meanspirited remarks today, during a televised interview and a speech at the Faith and Freedom Coalition. They included: Seeming excitement at the prospect of the late Senator John McCain spending eternity in damnation Threatening to fire his Federal Reserve Chairman Calling German chancellor Angela Merkel \u201csomeone who hates the United States perhaps worse than any person I\u2019ve ever met\u201d... Which is pretty weird because he\u2019s definitely met Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-Un. Attacking a US women\u2019s soccer player Joking about using his office to \u201cgo after\u201d political rivals All before heading off for Japan this afternoon. Hundreds of people out to demonstrate in Boston in solidarity with Wayfair workers who walked out over their company\u2019s decision to sell furniture for use in migrant detention centers. Senator and presidential hopeful Cory Booker is calling for hearings on reports of ICE using solitary confinement in migrant detention camps, often against mentally ill persons, and detainees who hadn\u2019t violated any rules. In a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, Booker cites May reports by NBC News and The Intercept that ICE placed thousands of immigrants in solitary confinement between 2012 and 2017. ICE\u2019s own policy seems to recognize the dangers of solitary confinement. The policy states that the \u2018[p]lacement of detainees in segregated housing is a serious step that requires careful consideration of alternatives... In particular, placement in administrative segregation due to a special vulnerability should be used only as a last resort and when no other viable housing options exist.\u2019\u201d -Cory Booker The Senate passed its own border supplement bill Wednesday with strong bipartisan support after the House passed one last night on a much tighter margin. Both bills allocate funding to address the humanitarian crisis, but the two pieces of legislation differ substantially in the details. The House bill has more constraints than the Senate version on how the Trump administration would use the money, leaving the next step unclear. Congressional leaders hope to send President Donald Trump a compromise measure before lawmakers leave town for a July 4 recess. Senate Majority leader McConnell and House Speaker Pelosi have both said reaching some type of legislative solution is a high priority. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is reportedly planning a vote on a bipartisan amendment to the country\u2019s current defense authorization legislation that would \u201cprohibit funds from being used for military operations against Iran without explicit authorization from Congress.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time for Congress to step up to our constitutional responsibilities before we find ourselves in another unnecessary and endless war in the Middle East,\u201d said Democratic Senator Tom Udall, one of the sponsors. \u201cWe need to stand up and take the hard votes. Our troops face live fire and sacrifice their lives \u2013 and we should have no sympathy for Congress ducking a vote on whether or not we go to war. Congress has not authorized war with Iran, and we need to make sure that saber rattling and miscalculation don\u2019t spark a catastrophic conflict, before it\u2019s too late.\u201d Democratic Senator Tim Kaine added: \u201cIt\u2019s time we have a real conversation on the Senate floor about what another war in the Middle East would do to our troops and the safety of the American people at home. This amendment is a guardrail to prevent Trump from unilaterally starting a war with Iran.\u201d Rand Paul, a Republican, is also a sponsor. \u201cEducation clearly has not been at the top of his list of priorities to address directly, but he has been very supportive of all the work that we\u2019ve done,\u201d DeVos said Wednesday in an interview with Denver radio station KDMT. \u201cI have a great relationship with the president,\u201d DeVos continued. \u201cAnd he has been very supportive of and encouraging of all of the initiatives that we\u2019ve undertaken.\u201d From Politico: DeVos\u2019 relationship with Trump was thrust into the spotlight earlier this year after the controversy over proposed funding cuts for the Special Olympics. DeVos publicly defended the administration\u2019s proposal for days until Trump suddenly reversed course, declaring that he had \u201coverridden my people.\u201d Earlier this month, Trump appeared to side with West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice in the governor\u2019s rift with DeVos and GOP legislators over charter schools and education savings account programs in the state. Online home goods retailer Wayfair sold roughly 1,600 mattresses and 100 bunk beds to Baptist Child and Family Services, a nonprofit that works as a federal contractor managing some of the camps along the southern border, according to a copy of the sales receipt obtained by CNBC and verified by an employee to the station. Wayfair employees staged a walkout Wednesday afternoon at its headquarters in Boston while many customers called for a boycott on social media. The announcement earlier today that Wayfair would donate profits from related sales to the Red Cross also haven\u2019t gone over particularly well on Twitter. According to the Daily Beast, Reddit quarantined the \u201cThe_Donald\u201d subreddit on Wednesday, \u201cciting threats made on the popular forum for Trump supporters against law enforcement officers.\u201d \u201cRecent behaviors including threats against the police and public figures is content that is prohibited by our violence policy,\u201d a Reddit spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, we have actioned individual users and quarantined the subreddit.\u201d World Cup winner Ali Krieger has thrown her support behind fellow USA soccer alum Megan Rapinoe in her spat with Donald Trump. The Daily Beast has compiled a friendly reminder of what candidates ought NOT to do at tonight\u2019s Democratic debate. Let\u2019s take a walk down memory lane, shall we? Rough start for former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper. Justice Neil Gorsuch continued his trend of joining his generally more liberal US Supreme Court colleagues in certain criminal cases, reports Bloomberg Law. Gorsuch wrote the court\u2019s opinion, released Wednesday, siding with a man convicted of child pornography offenses who faced more prison time for violating supervised release. From Bloomberg Law: Though a more reliably conservative vote in other areas\u2014and in criminal cases involving death row prisoners\u2014it\u2019s the latest instance of Gorsuch applying a limited government mentality to help convicts on appeal. Just this week, he cast the tie-breaking vote for the defense in another criminal case, and earlier this term provided the liberals with a fifth vote in decisions favoring American Indian rights. Thirty miles south of where Elizabeth Warren will take the stage on Wednesday night for the first of two presidential primary debates, the Massachusetts senator climbed a ladder to peer over a chain-link fence enclosing a detention center for young migrants. From her vantage point, Warren said a sprawling campus with massive white tents, metal trailers, a soccer field \u2013 and organized in single file lines, the children and young adults who are being housed at the facility in Homestead, Florida. \u201cThese were children who were being marched like they were soldiers - like they were prisoners - from one place to another,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThis is not what we should be doing as a country. These children did not commit a crime. These children pose no threat.\u201d The facility, which is run by Comprehensive Health Services, Inc., a private, for-profit company, has become a backdrop for Democratic presidential hopefuls to rail against Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies while in Miami, a city known as the capital of Latin America\u201d where more than 70% of the population is Hispanic, located in Florida, one of country\u2019s most important battleground states. Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar arrived on the scene shortly after Warren departed and Jane Sanders, the wife of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, also joined protesters on Wednesday. Democratic hopefuls Beto O\u2019Rourke and author Marianne Williamson were due to visit later this week. California congressman Eric Swallwell documented his visit here on Monday: \u201cThese children need homes, NOT a privatized prison,\u201d he said on Twitter. Their visits come after photos were published of a father and his toddler daughter face down in the Rio Grande river, where they drowned trying to cross the border to seek asylum in the United States and amid a fresh found of reports about the conditions that children are being kept in at Border Patrol stations near the border. Lawyers who had visited the facilities said children were being kept without adequate food, water or basic sanitary needs such as toothpaste and soap. \u201cWhat is happening at Homestead to children \u2013 what is happening is the direct result of activities of the United States government is wrong,\u201d Warren told a sweat-soaked crush of activists and reporters said Warren. \u201cIt is a stain on our country and we must speak out.\u201d Warren, who wore a hat with the message \u201cHome Instead\u201d, touted her plan to ban private, for-profit prisons and detention centers. = The senator was not scheduled to visit the facility, but added the stop after hearing from activists ahead of her town hall in Miami on Tuesday night. Jane Sanders told the Guardian it was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d to see the facility firsthand. She said Sanders first executive order as president would be to close the private detention facilities. She also that her husband had voted against legislation in that led to the creation of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency in 2002. \u201cEverything that he feared has come true,\u201d she said, referring to the agency, \u201cand it needs to be abolished. We need a complete overhaul of our immigration system.\u201d Trump tells CNN reporter that what he speaks about with Vladimir Putin is \u201cnone of your business.\u201d Politico reporter Eliana Johnson says that, per a senior Democratic aide, House Speaker Pelosi and President Trump spoke this afternoon for 15 minutes. \u201cThe Speaker placed the call to the President to try to reconcile the House and Senate border supplementals.\u201d Buzzfeed News is reporting that the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Inspector General found atrocious conditions in migrant detention facilities including \u201cstanding room only\u201d living space, and little access to hot showers or food. From Buzzfeed: When Department of Homeland Security inspectors visited several border facilities in the Rio Grande Valley earlier this month, they found adults and minors with no access to showers, many adults only fed bologna sandwiches, and detainees banging on cell windows \u2014 desperately pressing notes to the windows of their cells that detailed their time in custody. The inspectors compiled a draft report, obtained by BuzzFeed News, that described the conditions as dangerous and prolonged. Some adults were held in standing-room conditions for a week. There was little access to hot showers or hot food for families and children in some facilities. Some kids were being held in closed cells. There was severe overcrowding. The draft report was written by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Inspector General and addressed to the acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan. It comes after inspectors visited five border facilities and two ports of entry during the week of June 10. It appears to have been sent to DHS officials last week for comments and requests for redactions before being released publicly. \u201cSpecifically, we are recommending that the Department of Homeland Security take immediate steps to alleviate dangerous overcrowding and prolonged detention of children and adults in the Rio Grande Valley,\u201d wrote Jennifer Costello, acting inspector general. Trump, speaking at the Faith and Freedom Coalition Wednesday, seemed to suggest that he believes the late Senator John McCain is in hell, and that this idea brings him some joy. \u201cWe needed 60 votes. And we had 51 votes. And sometimes, you know, we had a little hard time with a couple of them, right,\u201d Trump said, which could be alluding to any of a few Senators who sometimes bucked Trump on bills, including former Senators Jeff Flake and Bob Corker.\u201d Trump continued: \u201cFortunately, they\u2019re gone now. They\u2019ve gone on to greener pastures. Or perhaps far less green pastures... They\u2019re gone. I\u2019m very happy they\u2019re gone.\u201d It takes a little bit of extrapolating, and Trump has plausible deniability if the comments attract widespread condemnation. But Trump\u2019s well-known, petty dislike for John McCain seems to point in his remarks having a particularly morose and nasty meaning. Trump made some light humor on authoritarianism to reporters Wednesday, saying that his administration wouldn\u2019t be enforcing the Johnson Amendment on pastors \u201cunless they speak against me, in which case I\u2019ll bring it back,\u201d before adding that he was \u201conly kidding\u201d. The Johnson Amendment prohibits all 501(c)(3) organizations, including houses of worship, from endorsing political candidates. Former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort is expected to be arraigned tomorrow at approximately 2:15pm before Judge Maxwell Wiley in Manhattan, Courthouse News\u2019 Adam Klasfeld is reporting. Manafort is currently in prison after having pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States and witness tampering in federal court in September. The charges in New York are unrelated mortgage fraud charges. Unlike the crimes he pleaded guilty to in the federal case, Manafort could not rely on a presidential pardon to eventually clear him in New York. From NBC Chicago: The Chicago bar whose employee spit on Eric Trump Tuesday night said in a statement that the employee in question has been placed on leave, calling the incident \u201cunfortunate\u201d and its fallout \u201ctroubling.\u201d \u201cLast night an unfortunate incident occurred between an employee at The Aviary and Eric Trump,\u201d began The Aviary\u2019s statement, released Wednesday morning. \u201cWe did not witness the incident and we are just beginning to learn the details.\u201d \u201cWhat is certain is this: no customer should ever be spit upon,\u201d the Fulton Market cocktail lounge continued. Multiple sources told NBC 5 that Eric Trump, the son of President Donald Trump, was a patron of the upscale cocktail lounge at around 8:30 p.m. when an employee approached and spit on him. Eric Trump later confirmed the incident in a statement to NBC News. We have not yet spoken with the employee but our HR team has, in the meantime, placed her on leave,\u201d The Aviary\u2019s statement continued, adding that the establishment would not discuss internal HR matters any further. More broadly, the online discussion about the incident is troubling,\u201d The Aviary continued, adding, \u201cHundreds of people are calling for the demise of our business, threatening our employees, and posting fake reviews... they are wrong to do so based on the actions of a lone individual. So too, however, are those people wrong who are praising this as an act of civil disobedience/ We have voices and the means to be heard. A degrading act lowers the tenor of debate. To some it might feel good, but it is unlikely to serve any larger purpose.\u201d We hope this incident can, at least, serve to illuminate the current absurdity of the discourse in our politics,\u201d the bar\u2019s statement concluded. \u201cAs fellow Americans and citizens, we should all aim higher.\u201d -The Aviary As conditions in migrant detention camps remain a contentious and hotly debated topic, 2020 Democratic candidates are jockeying Wednesday to bring attention to, and/or plant a flag in the issue- depending on your level of cynicism. Elizabeth Warren paid a visit to the Homestead detention facility outside Miami earlier this morning after a voter enccouraged her to show up during a town hall last night. Bernie Sanders\u2019 wife Jane is also at Homestead, telling reporters that closing detention facilities would be her husband\u2019s first executive order as president. Senators Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar also announced they would be visiting Homestead today. The Democratic candidates are all in south Florida in advance of the first primary debate scheduled for this evening. House Oversight chairman Jerry Nadler doesn\u2019t seem especially concerned about a White House attempt to block Robert Mueller from testifying next month. Wayfair, the mega online furniture retailer, is reportedly backing down in a standoff with its employees over having accepted orders from the US government for items used in migrant detention camps. The company had initially issued a statement which read in part: As a retailer, it is standard practice to fulfill orders for all customers and we believe it is our business to sell to any customer who is acting within the laws of the countries within which we operate. We believe all of our stakeholders, employees, customers, investors and suppliers included, are best served by our commitment to fulfill all orders. This does not indicate support for the opinions or actions of the groups or individuals who purchase from us. But pressure was mounting, not only from employees who staged a walkout Tuesday, but across social media where customers and potential customers were threatening boycotts. It remains unclear whether the announcement will satisfy either group. A House committee voted Wednesday to authorize a subpoena for White House counselor Kellyanne Conway after she failed to show for a hearing on a government watchdog\u2019s findings that she broke the law dozens of times. Conway is skipping the hearings with the support of White House lawyers. Oversight committee chairman Elijah Cummings has warned that his panel would vote to hold Conway in contempt if she ignores the subpoena. From The Washington Post: The House Oversight Committee voted, 25-to-16, for the subpoena after Special Counsel Henry Kerner said she blatantly violated the Hatch Act, a law that bars federal employees from engaging in politics during work. \u201cMs. Conway\u2019s egregious and repeated Hatch Act violations, combined with her unrepentant attitude, are unacceptable from any federal employee, let along one in such a prominent position,\u201d Kerner told the panel. \u201cHer conduct hurts both federal employees, who may believe that senior officials can act with complete disregard for the Hatch Act, and the American people, who may question the nonpartisan operation of their government.\u201d In an interview shared yesterday, USA soccer player Megan Rapinoe scoffed at the notion of going to the White House in the event of a potential Women\u2019s World Cup victory. Trump heard and responded characteristically, in a series of Tweets: Women\u2019s soccer player, @mPinoe, just stated that she is \u201cnot going to the F...ing White House if we win.\u201d Other than the NBA, which now refuses to call owners, owners (please explain that I just got Criminal Justice Reform passed, Black unemployment is at the lowest level... in our Country\u2019s history, and the poverty index is also best number EVER), leagues and teams love coming to the White House. I am a big fan of the American Team, and Women\u2019s Soccer, but Megan should WIN first before she TALKS! Finish the job! We haven\u2019t yet...invited Megan or the team, but I am now inviting the TEAM, win or lose. Megan should never disrespect our Country, the White House, or our Flag, especially since so much has been done for her &amp; the team. Be proud of the Flag that you wear. The USA is doing GREAT!\u201d One problem. Trump initially tweeted his reply to the wrong account. The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s air chief\u2014who has been leading the Trump administration\u2019s rollbacks of rules for pollution and climate change\u2014is departing amid a congressional probe of a possible ethics violation. Bill Wehrum, a lawyer who has represented energy interests, came under scrutiny after meeting with two former clients and taking part in a decision in favor of a former client, the power company DTE Energy, according to the Washington Post. EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler did not say why Wehrum is leaving but commended him for \u201chis service, his dedication to his job, the leadership he provided to his staff and the agency, and for his friendship.\u201d Wehrum was confirmed in November 2017. Two Republican senators said Tuesday the sexual assault allegation made against President Donald Trump by writer E Jean Carroll should be investigated, while most of the party has mostly ignored the claims or defended the president. From CNN: Joni Ernst of Iowa said Trump and Carroll should be questioned about the alleged assault. \u201cI think anybody that makes an accusation like that, they should come forward,\u201d Ernst said when asked if Carroll should be believed. \u201cBut obviously there has to be some additional information. They need to interview her. They need to visit with him.\u201d Mitt Romney of Utah said there needs to be an \u201cevaluation\u201d but that he didn\u2019t know what entity should conduct it, \u201cwhether it\u2019s Congress or whether it\u2019s another setting, I\u2019m not sure. \u201cIt\u2019s a very serious allegation,\u201d Romney said. \u201cI hope that it is fully evaluated. The president said it didn\u2019t happen and I certainly hope that\u2019s the case.\u201d Ernst shared in January that she herself is a survivor of sexual assault. A Senate hearing on the \u201cunprecedented migration at the US southern border\u201d is just getting underway and you can watch live here. Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson, chairman of the committee holding the hearing, said in his opening remarks: \u201cWe\u2019ll hear stories of [migrants who] probably have already been placed into involuntary servitude. We have records of people being beaten, and videos taken and sent back down to their home countries demanding payment.\u201d Johnson expressed concerns that the system for processing migrants at the southern border is completely overwhelmed, sentiments that were echoed by Brian Hastings, Chief of the Law Enforcement Operations Directorate of US Border Patrol. \u201cThree weeks into the month, we\u2019ve already passed the apprehension level for every June since 2007,\u201d Hastings said. \u201cThe flow continues to overwhelm resources throughout the immigration system.\u201d The hearings come as a photograph of a father and his 23-month-old daughter face down along the banks of the Rio Grande is being published around the world as a grisly representation of the dangers that migrants face on the border. The Hill is reporting that Code Pink activists have been granted a permit to fly the \u201cBaby Trump balloon\u201d just blocks from the White House during Trump\u2019s July 4 celebration. With news coming yesterday that special council Robert Mueller will be testifying before Congress next month, Trump took his televised interview as a chance to make unfounded broadsides at him \u2013 accusing him of illegally disposing of evidence during the investigation. Trump rules out replacing his vice-president, Mike Pence, with former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, as a Wall Street Journal op-ed suggested Trump ought to do earlier this week. I love Nikki, she\u2019s endorsed me, she\u2019s my friend, but Mike has been a great Vice President...I love Nikki...but you can\u2019t break up a team like us, we get along together.\u201d -Donald Trump on running mate questions. On the escalating tensions between the US and Iran after a US drone was shot down last week Trump says he \u201chopes\u201d the two countries don\u2019t go to war, but \u201cwe are in a very strong position\u2026 it would not last long\u2026 I\u2019m not talking boots on the ground\u2026 just saying if something happened it wouldn\u2019t last long.\u201d Good morning and welcome to the politics live blog for Wednesday the 26th of June. We kick off this morning with Fox Business Network, where Donald Trump started off the morning by attacking his Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, on national television. Trump\u2019s remarks came in the midst of a wide-ranging interview with host Maria Bartiromo. he president Trump and Powell have been at loggerheads over the chairman\u2019s raising of interest rates while Powell has made a public display of touting the bank\u2019s independence from the president\u2019s wishes. Other recipients of Trump attacks this morning include Twitter, Trump\u2019s preferred means of public communication, who he says is \u201cbiased\u201d against him, Google, who Trump says is \u201ctrying to rig the election\u201d and German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who, without mentioning her by name, Trump claims \u201chates the United States perhaps worse than any person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
