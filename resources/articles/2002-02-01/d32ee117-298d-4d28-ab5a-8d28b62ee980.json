Miller, who had a stomach bug, replaces the Llanelli flanker Simon Easterby, who drops to the bench. O'Kelly takes the place of the concussed Paul O'Connell, whose replacement against Wales, Gary Longwell, helped himself to an abundance of the visitors' lineout throws. \"Both decisions were difficult,\" said the Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan. \"They were made on the basis that Eric and Malcolm would have been first choices against Wales had they been fit but both will need big performances to justify their selection.\" O'Sullivan said that Miller, who was sent off during Leinster's Celtic League final against Munster last month, had been Ireland's form player all season and Easterby took his omission philosophically. \"I knew I would not have played against Wales had Eric been available,\" he said. \"We have an abundance of riches in the back row and one of the reasons why we have done so well in the last couple of years is that there is now an intense competition for places.\" Rob Henderson, who made a significant impact in the centre for the Lions in Australia last year, remains on the bench with Bath's Kevin Maggs partnering Brian O'Driscoll in the midfield. While O'Sullivan selected from strength, the France coach Bernard Laporte was forced to make six changes from the side that beat Italy for Saturday's visit to Wales. The flanker Olivier Magne is banned and Laporte dropped the lock David Auradou for being sin-binned against Italy. Such has been the upheaval in the French squad in the last year that there are only three survivors from the side that lost to Wales in Paris last March: the outside-half Gerald Merceron, the hooker Raphael Ibanez, recalled because Yannick Bru is injured, and the prop Pieter de Villiers. Wales have called their most capped forward, the Neath second-row Gareth Llewellyn, into their squad to cover for Chris Wyatt and Andy Moore, both doubtful because of ankle and neck injuries respectively. The 32-year-old Llewellyn won the last of his 64 caps during the 1999 World Cup and he is set to start his first championship match for four years. Another member of Wales's 50-club, the Bridgend centre Gareth Thomas, has been dropped from the A team for missing a training session this week. Cardiff's director of rugby Rudy Joubert is one of four candidates on the shortlist for the South Africa coaching job. Rudi Straeuli, Jake White and Allister Coetzee are the others. South Africa's 29-year-old back-row Rassie Erasmus is joining London Irish on a two-year contract this summer. Harlequins have completed the signing of Fiji's full-back Norman Ligairi.
