City host West Ham United on Sunday knowing that a point guarantees a second Premier League crown in three years in Pellegrini's first season in charge. While his immediate predecessor, Roberto Mancini, was a volatile character the Chilean has been a serene influence in what has been a topsy-turvy championship race. Yet the 60-year-old said that much had changed from his time as a defender at Universidad de Chile. \"When I started this career maybe I had an absolutely different character,\" he said. \"As a player, I had a different character than I have today. To prepare to be a manager you must change a lot of things and one of those things I was sure I had to change was my character.\" Pellegrini was asked if he might have been a mad dog on the pitch. \"Absolutely yes. I decided [to change]. There is another way of managing than as a player. You have to decide you are no longer a player and have a different [approach].\" Pellegrini shrugged off any notion of being nervous on Sunday. \"It is very important for the manager to be calm, to try to repeat what we did the whole year. Preparing the game here is one game more. We must prepare the same way.\" At differing times in the campaign Pellegrini has been without key players. Vincent Kompany, Sergio Ag\u00fcero, David Silva and Yaya Tour\u00e9 have all been missing, with the quartet playing together for a total of 216 minutes, equivalent to less than two and a half games. Ag\u00fcero, who is fit to face West Ham following a hamstring problem, has started only 19 matches, making three substitute appearances. Pellegrini said rival clubs could not have coped as well as City had they missed equivalent players. \"I don't want to compare other teams but I think maybe this team was without Ag\u00fcero, he missed 14-15 games in the Premier League. Maybe some other teams \u2013 you take Su\u00e1rez out of 15 games for Liverpool or Hazard from Chelsea or Cazorla from Arsenal [how would they cope?].\" In Wednesday evening's 4-0 rout of Aston Villa, the crowd became restless until City scored. Asked whether that could be a concern on Sunday if the match is goalless for a long period, Pellegrini said: \"It's impossible for me to know what will happen in the future. I don't know what will happen in that game. One of the most important things we did against Aston Villa was not worry about not scoring. We were playing well, we were a balanced team, we didn't have any problem, [or] let Aston Villa have a chance to score. \"We created three or four clear chances but didn't score. That was most important \u2013 the personality, the character of the team. They knew we were going to win and continued in the same way until the end.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
