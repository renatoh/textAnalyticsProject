Oudolf is an intriguing figure, a gardener who prizes not flowers or decorative features or even colour but the muscularforms and textures of plants and grasses. His gardens are so fascinating that they almost assume the status of abstract art (although this is not an idea closely examined in this documentary) and they could be described as site-specific installations where the garden itself is the site. He also designed the Battery Gardens in New York and the Lurie Garden in Chicago, as well as various projects in Europe \u2013 although my one tiny quarrel with this film is that there is nothing about his Millennium Garden in Norfolk\u2019s Pensthorpe Nature Reserve, once the home of BBC\u2019s Springwatch. \u201cPlants are characters I compose with and I put them on the stage,\u201d he says at one stage, and at another: \u201cThere are too many flowers. I long for their decay, when they turn to skeletons.\u201d There is something almost Uncle Monty-ish about Oudolf at times, despising mere floral beauty."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
