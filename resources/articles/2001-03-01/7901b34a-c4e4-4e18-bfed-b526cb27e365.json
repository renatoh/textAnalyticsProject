Internal papers prepared for the party say that \"this work is so extensive that it has potential implications for the direction of the party over many years\". Margaret McDonagh, the party general secretary, said of the project: \"All political parties need to keep changing and rethink how they can be closer to the local community. It will involve very large cultural change for Labour.\" In the experiments there will be fewer routine meetings and more activity based on specific tasks, and policy development will be opened to non-party members. The party also wants to develop a less hierarchical organisation. Police and victim support groups will be formally consulted to help the local party to develop a crime policy. Hospital workers will be canvassed for their views on the health service. The pilots, called constituency development plans, will examine whether local parties can be reorganised to concentrate on task group working, such as securing a school zebra crossing or extra investment in a community from a company. Labour's membership, at around 380,000, has not fallen, but the party is finding it hard to retain recruits. Ian McCartney, the Cabinet Office minister who is overseeing the reforms, said: \"Labour cannot have a static straitjacket structure which deals only with minutes and reports... Labour has to be a politically vibrant organisation and not just abureaucratic structure that services itself.\" The pilots, to be spread around every part of the country, will examine ways of working with local government, unions, young people, women, trade unions and black and Asian members. They will experiment with new ways to recruit members, campaign, raise funds and spot young, talented potential activists or candidates. The pilots are to be agreed between Millbank and local parties but will include agreed targets and extra support from the centre. Constituencies will bid to join the schemes. Hazel Blears, Labour MP for Salford and party development coordinator, said: \"Everywhere we went people wanted to change their structures... Except for a minority that want to live on general committees, party members are bored to death, and it's taking up too much of their time.\" Labour is seeking cash from the unions to develop the project. Mr McCartney admitted that at local level the relationship between parties and union branches was \"ineffective at best and non-existent at worst. It needs to be reinvigorated.\" The party wants to examine ways of using technology to revolutionise its communications, policy making and contacts between the membership and ministers. The proposals are to be discussed at the party development committee on April 9 if the election is not cancelled. Either way, Mr McCartney promised that the the project would be developed quickly after the election."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
