But for the director and the team who made it alongside him, no detail was too small to consider. \u201cIt was very important, the question of historical accuracy,\u201d said Mendes. \u201cWe had two very fine historical advisers, Andy Robertshaw and Peter Barton, who are world renowned. And one military adviser, Paul Biddiss, who was also brilliant.\u201d The film, out in cinemas in January, has already won many admiring reviews and was premiered last Wednesday in front of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall at Leicester Square. Set on 6 April in northern France, after the Germans had staged a tactical retreat to the position known as the Hindenburg Line, 1917 follows a soldier\u2019s deadly mission to help a family member. Mendes\u2019s own mission as director was to be faithful to the experiences of the men who fought, including his own grandfather, Alfred H Mendes. As a child the Oscar-winning director of American Beauty and Skyfall often listened to the wartime stories of his charismatic grandparent, a teenage lance corporal in 1917, and wondered at the thin line they described between luck and misfortune, life and death. One \u201cfragment\u201d in particular, the story of a message carried through the mist of no man\u2019s land at dusk, has never left Mendes; it sparked the plot of his first screenplay, co-written with Krysty Wilson-Cairns. \u201cThe film is a compression of time and place, so you take what\u2019s important,\u201d said Mendes. \u201cYou are not making a documentary, but you do want it to feel, in every possible detail, historically accurate.\u201d Mendes adds that Biddiss was vital for \u201chands-on\u201d military and technical advice: \u201cwhat\u2019s in their kit bag, how to handle their weapons \u2013 this sort of stuff\u201d. Robertshaw concentrated on getting the practical surroundings right: \u201cWhat\u2019s in the trenches, what\u2019s in the dug-outs, what they would have imported or brought from home.\u201d The director describes Barton, the historian, as \u201cmore of an overall challenger\u201d. Once a draft of the screenplay was written Mendes and Wilson-Cairns handed it over. \u201cI just said: \u2018Pick as many holes in the script as you can.\u2019 And he did. At great length. And it was tough actually. There were some really hard notes to factor in. But we did. And if we didn\u2019t, there was a specific reason,\u201d said Mendes. While the shape of a military helmet might not be enough to make or marr a good film, for Mendes and his advisers it was imperative to replicate the uniforms shown in documentary footage and photographs. Many other dramas set in the trenches have thriftily relied upon re-purposed second world war helmets. But not on the set of 1917. Although the Brodie helmets worn in \u201cthe Great War\u201d are no longer around in large numbers, Mendes\u2019s troops wear accurate recreations. What is more, they differ subtly from one battalion to another, since at the time the film is set, helmet shape was changing. \u201cWhen I watched the footage back each day I tried to find any slip that I possibly could, such as undone ammunition pouches,\u201d said Biddiss, an ex-paratrooper who ran the six-month training camp set up before filming by Mendes for those chosen to play troops. \u201cIn the first world war soldiers were taught to check their ammunition before they moved off,\u201d said Biddiss. \u201cLance Corporal Schofield, played by George MacKay, is supposed to have fought in the Somme and so would have already had problems with his webbing [military belts and harnesses]. Soldiers had found it flapped open and the bullets often fell out so after the Somme it was modified and all soldiers were drilled to check their pouches. They still are today.\u201d The open-air action was filmed this summer on Salisbury Plain and in Bovingdon, Hertfordshire. Other scenes were filmed in Oxfordshire, Glasgow and in a Darlington river. In February, before the long shoot in Salisbury, the film crew invited local men aged 16-35 to audition to become troops. And then Biddiss\u2019s training camp began. MacKay, who stars in the film alongside Dean-Charles Chapman, has spoken of this training period as \u201can incredible process\u201d. \u201cWe had to make sure they were all mentally and physically fit,\u201d said Biddiss. \u201cWe used about 800 men in all and about 500 for the Salisbury section, as well as the main cast. I wanted them all to understand the etiquette of the trenches.\u201d Several of those selected were asked to grow moustaches, although beards were not permitted, except for the Sikh soldiers in turbans. \u201cOne of the first lessons I gave George and Dean was about their boots,\u201d said Biddiss. \u201cI told them looking after them would be as crucial for them as it had been for the soldiers.\u201d Clad in hobnail boots for 12-hour days, the young actors learned to act quickly when they felt the \u201chotspots\u201d that would lead to blisters and which, during the war, would have gone on endanger their lives as full-blown trenchfoot. \u201cI also taught them not to put their fingers on the trigger of their guns. Soldiers are trained to do that only when about to fire,\u201d said Biddiss. Character was key to the advice required and so Biddiss suggested the nervous novice played by Chapman should continually check his bayonet as they await an order to go \u201cover the top\u201d. He also said that when MacKay\u2019s corporal is injured, it should be a glancing blow to the head rather than a shoulder wound that would quickly incapacitate any soldier. Establishing the emotions felt by the assembled troops was also a priority for Mendes and Biddiss, even though some of them would be in shot just for a moment. \u201cI emphasised the fear and anger,\u201d Biddiss said. \u201cI can relate to that because I remember jumping out of a Chinook in the dark after I had been briefed that there were people out there who wanted to kill me. \u201cIn fear, you breathe and taste the air differently, knowing you may die. And the anger was important because that is how soldiers feel when they realise they are in a dangerous situation.\u201d The military adviser was especially happy with a scene near the close of the film when one of the young heroes runs through a long trench against the clock. It clearly shows how trenches were organised, with sergeants and platoon sergeants running things, while an officer is shown breaking down with nerves. And what was the need for all this military training, followed by such a long rehearsal period? Well, Mendes had decided early on he wanted to make the film in a continuous shot, as if happening in real time. \u201cWhen Sam told me,\u201d recalled Biddiss, \u201che said, \u2018So it has got to be on the money from the word \u201cAction\u201d\u2019. No pressure!\u201d And for Biddiss the film became more personal than expected. \u201cI discovered while working on this that one of my uncles, Lance Corporal Robert Victor Biddiss of the London Regiment, had died in December 1917 as he moved into the Hindenburg Support advance.\u201d The effort to honour the story accurately was then more pertinent. \u201cIt was important for all of us to get it right, not just for Sam, because we all have relatives who fought.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
