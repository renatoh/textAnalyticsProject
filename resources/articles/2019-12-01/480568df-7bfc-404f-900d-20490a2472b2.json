It\u2019s a beautiful day outside but it\u2019s pitch black inside this steel box. Metal is screeching overhead as a flight attendant softly tells me I\u2019m going to die. This is Flight, the latest immersive theatre work/public panic attack from UK group Darkfield. Audiences are strapped into 20 or so seats from a decommissioned plane and experience the work through binaural headphones in the dark. Over the course of 30 minutes you live through two surreal and intersecting realities: one where the plane lands and another that\u2019s not so lucky. The show is in Melbourne for one more week and people are frantically tagging their mates on Instagram: \u201cWe need to do this!!\u201d A young woman asks: \u201cDoes it involve getting kidnapped?\u201d Her friend replies: \u201cIf you\u2019re lucky!!\u201d Only one of these comments \u2013 posted on a video of Blair Witch-style flickering cabin lights \u2013 feels true to my experience: \u201cJesus Christ\u201d. I\u2019m not the ideal audience member for this work \u2013 or, in a weird way, maybe I am? I write the contents of this show every time I set foot on a plane. I imagine each thing that could go wrong and analyse the noises and studiously count the seats to my nearest exit. I have exercises to cope with the anxiety. Unfortunately, the first step is often closing my eyes, to centre and stabilise myself \u2013 but this isn\u2019t helpful inside a plane that\u2019s plunged into darkness. Still, I\u2019ve felt much safer on 15-hour international flights than I felt during the 30 minutes inside this stationary shipping container sitting 50 metres from the Southbank Macca\u2019s. People have always wanted to experience or understand the extremes of this world (think Greek tragedies and \u201cfreak shows\u201d), but there is something very 2019 about knowingly paying a dollar a minute to take part in a plane crash. This is an age of climate crisis and murder podcasts and people begging Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet to run you over with his car. With rolling doomsday updates in our pockets at all times, we\u2019ve never been more exposed to the spectre of death. We\u2019re all more desensitised to it and some of us are looking for small ways to conquer it. Fear also has a visceral appeal. Explaining the enduring appeal of haunted houses, sociologist Margee Kerr told the Atlantic \u201cit\u2019s all about triggering the amazing fight-or-flight response to experience the flood of adrenaline, endorphins and dopamine\u201d. When this is done in a space the mind rationally recognises as safe, \u201cwe are often left feeling satisfied, reassured of our safety and more confident in our ability to confront the things that initially scared us\u201d. The creatives behind Flight are happy to compare their work to haunted houses. Darkfield describes itself as \u201ca multisensory sonic theme park\u201d and boasts that its shows will \u201csteal you from reality\u201d. The first work it released in 2017 was a \u201cspine-tingling\u201d seance ripped straight from the tradition of Victorian-era spiritualism and supercharged by modern technology. Director David Rosenberg has said the work, which is also carried out in the dark, \u201cis a bit like a sideshow fairground ride\u201d. Since then, more than 100,000 people have attended Darkfield works across the UK, Australia and Mexico. Flight is the second show from the company, and the third is called Coma (it\u2019s exactly what it sounds like). It\u2019s often been said these shows \u2013 Flight included \u2013 are not \u201csubstantial enough\u201d as works of theatre; that the physical thrill is impressive but empty of meaning. One reviewer described Coma as \u201ca scary movie without a message\u201d. For what it\u2019s worth, Flight does try to hint at more: it\u2019s loosely concerned with parallel universes and has passing references to Schr\u00f6dinger. But that\u2019s not why people are rushing out to lock themselves in this steel box. My friend doesn\u2019t do too badly on planes, but she does suffer from anxiety too. We often confess our fears to each other about money, relationships, ageing, the environment, work, social media, family, health, housing \u2013 all of it. Some are irrational, others not so much. I asked her why she agreed to come along to Flight and she replied: \u201cI\u2019m terrified of dying, but I also want to know what it\u2019s like to die.\u201d After the terror, as I stepped into the sun, I did feel a sense of twisted comfort. The fear was all for nothing. Actually, right now, in this moment, I\u2019m OK. I can\u2019t say I recommend it, but I think I understand the appeal. \u2022 Flight is in Southbank, Melbourne until 8 December"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
