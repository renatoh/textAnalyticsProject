The narrow old streets of the centre are packed with revellers working hard at having fun. It is two in the morning, but the night is just beginning. There are clubs to go to. I choose Pacha, the oldest and most famous. I start moving to its insistent rhythm: before long I have lost track of time. Oddly, when I leave, it is bright daylight. I need to chill out. I need nature, long sandy beaches, a place where time stands still and allows me to catch up. Luckily the island of Formentera is just half an hour away. So I catch a ferry across to a different world. Arriving at the port of La Savina knowing that you have time to kill in Formentera is one of life's great pleasures. The island is famous for its laid-back atmosphere. In the 1960s, hundreds of hippies made the place their home, including Bob Dylan, who lived in a windmill and gave impromptu concerts which are still spoken about today. Pink Floyd used to hang out there. Though there are more tourists about nowadays, even in peak season the island oozes a laissez-faire, chilled out vibe. Most of the visitors are young and Italian. They know how to relax and look good at the same time. I hire a bicycle and ride out to my accommodation: a villa in a pine wood on the outskirts of the village of Es Pujols. Like most buildings on the island it's been built with the heat in mind: single storey, whitewashed, fronted by a covered terrace. Most importantly there is a large bed: I catch a few hours' sleep. You can negotiate most of Formentera on a bicycle. The island is 11 miles long, no more than five miles wide, and mostly flat. In the daytime, with the temperature in the 30s, it is advisable to head to one of the many beaches. Soon I find myself in Platja de ses Illetes, a dune-backed white-sanded beach on a spit of land pointing towards Ibiza. It is so splendid and with such clear turquoise water that it is rumoured that the Seychelles tourist board use pictures of it in their promotion brochures. Unfortunately it's packed. Illetes is near the port and a favourite spot for day-trippers from Ibiza. There are scores of yachts moored out to sea: the beach is said to be favoured by the rich and famous taking a break from the rigours of the party island. There's talk that Kate Moss is around. The Emir of Qatar. After a dip in the bath-warm water, I wander off for lunch in the beachside Juan y Andrea restaurant. \"Have you had many famous customers,\" I ask a waiter. \"How famous do you want?\" He replies. \"You know, really famous.\" \"Bill Clinton, Bill Gates. Is that famous enough?\" This won't do, I need somewhere quieter. So I get back on my bicycle, and head for the longest and wildest beach on the island, Platja de Migjorn, which stretches 8km along the south coast. Here the beach is rockier, and the water is choppier, a deeper shade of blue. Sunbathers are sparsely scattered, many of them naked. I take all my clothes off, embarrassed, choosing a spot to swim where I figure the nearby nude guy playing beach tennis will divert any attention. The water is warm, the experience liberating. I swim around for 20 minutes, shedding weeks of stress. Several hours later, several shades browner, I watch the yellow sun drop into the sea from a chiringuito beach bar, a beer in my hand, a grin on my face. That's more like it. Later, eating delicate Catalan-style oven-baked fish in the nearby Sa Sargantana restaurant, and sipping Galician ribera wine, I realise that the last time I was this happy was the last time I was on the island, in April. Sure, the place is more crowded in July, and the roads are full of scooters. But the authorities have controlled the number of hotels and discos (there are only two small clubs, in Es Pujols), and they have ruled out the sort of high-rise construction that blights much of Spain's coastline. There isn't a crane in sight, but if you're lucky, you will see flamingos in one of the converted salt-pan lakes which make the place a favourite for birdwatchers. Much of the island is protected national parkland, and there are plenty of spots where the summer crowds don't venture. The next day, I drift around, without feeling the need to look at my watch. I give the bathers on Es Pujols beach a slapstick comedy show attempting to learn to windsurf, realising that my body has little natural balance, but a vast capacity for digesting seawater. I take a bus to the lighthouse on the top of the La Mola limestone cliffs, which feels like the end of the earth, and potter round the nearby hippy craft market, all handmade silver bracelets and amulets fashioned from local stone (after some deliberation, I decide that I don't really need another sarong). I have an evening swim from a covey beach in Es Calo. I end the night in the Blue Bar, on Platja Migjorn, from where fanciful locals claim that on a clear day you can see the coast of Africa. I would love to be able to spend a few weeks on Formentera. You can learn to make guitars in the laid-back village of San Ferran; you can learn to scuba dive, and see the barracuda among wrecks on the sea bed. It's the sort of place where you could write a novel. Once you discover the island, you know that you'll come back. It is a quiet, soothing antidote to its hyperactive bigger brother 12 miles to the north, even in July. Next time, as soon as I can, I'll head straight for the chill-out option, without stopping off to party on the way. For me, the best thing about Ibiza Town is leaving it, knowing that Formentera lies ahead. Five best beach bars Fonda Pepe, San Ferran The original hippy bar, started up in the 50s. Artwork by former customers transports you back to the island's hedonistic heyday of the late 60s. Locals and savvy tourists spill on to the street until the small hours. There's also a restaurant in the back. Open till late. Blue Bar, Platja Migjorn Dylan played here; Pink Floyd played here; nowadays a DJ spins chill-out tunes as the hip clientele lounge in front of the beach. Genial waiters with CND signs on their backs serve food and drink on the terrace. Great for a late-night cocktail, followed by a late night swim (but be careful). Open till 4am. Pirata Bus, Platja Es Arenals Thirty years ago, Pascual drove a rusty white bus over from Ibiza and turned it into a bar. The bus is gone but the ramshackle spirit remains: this is the best place on the island to watch the sunset. Open till the sun drops into the water. Lucky, Platja Migjorn A chiringuito (wooden shack) run by Andrea and Claudio, who serve superb spaghetti bolognese to a discerning Italian clientele, and chupitos (shots) to the largely naked bathers on the beach in front. Open till sunset. Chandraloka, Platja de Es Pujols Jasmine-scented, wooden-floored bar playing the likes of Tom Waits, Paolo Conte and Nancy Sinatra, with plump cushions, Chinese lanterns and massages on offer. Open till late. Way to go Getting there: easyJet (easyjet.com) flies to Ibiza from Gatwick, Liverpool, Newcastle and Stansted from \u00a351 rtn inc tax.
