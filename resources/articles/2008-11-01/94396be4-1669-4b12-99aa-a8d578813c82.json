It belongs to Luci Baines Johnson, daughter of President LBJ. Luci has been campaigning for Obama here in Texas over the past few months and she's just an hour or so away from discovering the outcome. We're at the official Texas Democrats election night victory party. Most of the people here are standing watching one of several giant TV screens in various hallways and rooms on the first floor of this vast hotel. They're tuned to either CNN or MSNBC and when the ads come on, different people pick up the microphone to rally a crowd that needs little encouragement. Everyone here is euphoric. There are huge cheers as Obama is projected to win in Ohio and Florida. There's a real mix of people here: black, white, Hispanic, old and young. Someone walks past with a T-shirt that reads \"Barack's Got My Back\". Another wears one that says \"Barack Obama is my Homeboy\". An older man walks down the big staircase sporting a \"Longhorns for Obama\" T-shirt \u2013 the nickname for the University of Texas athletics team. I notice a couple of large Stetsons as well. I meet a man called Jonathan Francis, a large black man who is a volunteer for the Obama campaign, and who has tears running down his face. \"I'm on cloud nine,\" he says as he hugs me. \"I'm right there with you,\" says another guy as he walks past us. Jonathan says this is the day he's been hoping for. \"It's the hope of every African American in this country. We never thought we'd see this happen. Our parents' parents dreamed of this moment. I'm so emotional. And I promised myself I wouldn't fall apart.\" William Richard and Wanda Rochelle have driven down from Holland, an hour north of here, to watch the results in Austin, the state capital. \"How are you feeling?\" I ask. \"Happy. And positive,\" William says. \"Gas prices just went down.\" He roars with laughter. \"That meant we were able to come out and vote,\" Wanda says, chuckling. \"This is different to previous elections though. This time there's more unity and respect from people across the board. People are listening more. They're understanding and basing their decisions on facts.\" \"We'll be praying for his safety,\" says William. \"I'm concerned for Barack. There are people out there who may want to do something foolish. There are some haters out there.\" \"Their fear has come from the last eight years,\" Wanda says. \"And we need to fix it.\" Suddenly a voice comes over the Tannoy again. \"In just a few minutes we'll be able to say 'Yes we did. Yes we did',\" it says. \"Isn't it great to be a Democrat in the state of Texas?\" It doesn't matter right now that McCain will win around 55% of the vote in this state (even though Travis County, where we are right now, is a Democratic stronghold in a sea of Republican red). The Texans in this room tonight know that life is going to change for them regardless."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
