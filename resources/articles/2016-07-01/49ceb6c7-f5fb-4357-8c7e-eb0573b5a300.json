With Sarah Palin as his opening act, he needed to woo a gathering of deeply conservative voters in this critical swing state and make nice after offending the entire political establishment during the primary season. He also needed to appeal to the broader general election audience as the political conventions near \u2013 and sound like a man who could actually be president. And he had to accomplish it all during his first campaign visit to the Centennial State \u2013 ever \u2013 in a cavernous ballroom where empty seats were in the obvious majority. \u201cThis is a tremendous crowd,\u201d he told the Western Conservative Summit, which boasted 4,000 eager attendees, most of whom did not show up to hear the presumptive Republican nominee for president, who was nearly an hour late for his morning keynote speech. Palin, who was introduced as a \u201cconservative political icon\u201d, stepped in to fill the empty time and hit all the Tea Party high notes before Trump arrived on stage. She lamented the \u201cSwiss cheese borders\u201d and decried \u201cthose who don\u2019t yearn for America\u2019s freedoms ... but instead yearn for child brides and female mutilation and killing all gays and nonbelievers and refusing assimilation\u201d. She slammed what she called the \u201cGOP wing of the good old boys\u2019 club\u201d, those establishment Republicans who will not support Trump and have worked to find another option to face Hillary Clinton. They feel threatened, she said, by the passionate men and women who stand behind the billionaire. \u201cI call them Republicans against Trump, or RAT for short,\u201d Palin said, as the audience applauded. \u201cThey want to take their [Denver] Nuggets ball and stay home instead of vote, because their guy didn\u2019t win this time around? I shouldn\u2019t call them thumb-suckers. They\u2019re not all bad. I\u2019m kidding. They are.\u201d Just how much Palin helps a Republican nominee struggling to broaden his reach is up for debate. Trump lauded the 2008 vice-presidential candidate \u2013 but he waited until nearly 10 minutes into a 50-minute speech. Before he got to Palin, he thanked former rival Ben Carson, Jerry Falwell Jr, Ralph Reed, and the National Rifle Association. \u201cWhen people think of high-mindedness and dignity, the face of Sarah Palin does not appear in the mind\u2019s eye,\u201d said John J Pitney Jr, a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College. \u201cThe only thing Sarah Palin can do for him is rally the Republican base. But at this point in the campaign, he needs to move beyond that base, and she is not helpful.\u201d Before thanking Palin, Trump also had a long riff about his relationship with teleprompters, which he said last year should be banned during presidential elections, but which he has begun using more often as a way to stay on script. He didn\u2019t use one Friday morning, although they were present on stage at the Colorado Convention Center. \u201cI\u2019m starting to love those teleprompters,\u201d Trump joked. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s interesting, it\u2019s much easier when you have a teleprompter, and I\u2019m getting great reviews with the teleprompters. But when you stand up and just go at it, it\u2019s much more exciting.\u201d Trump also acknowledged his high-profile social media spat with Colorado\u2019s Republican senator Cory Gardner, who has not endorsed him, and his primary season outburst in which he told the entire state that its political system is broken. Colorado, he said, \u201ctaught me a lot about politics. I learned a lot. Because polls came out that I was gonna win Colorado and doing really well in Colorado, and I was looking forward to it. And then all of a sudden I didn\u2019t get the delegates. I said, \u2018What happened to the vote?\u2019, remember? I started to learn. I\u2019m a quick learner.\u201d By the time the Colorado Republican convention ended on 9 April, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas had swept all 34 of the state\u2019s available delegates in a rare skunking of the real estate magnate. A day later, a stunned Trump tweeted that he was just aghast about the lack of democracy in Colorado. \u201cHow is it possible,\u201d Trump fumed, \u201cthat the people of the great state of Colorado never got to vote in the Republican primary? Great anger \u2013 totally unfair!\u201d Followed moments later by: \u201cThe people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians. Biggest story in politics. This will not be allowed!\u201d Actually, it was. Colorado is a caucus state, and the GOP there chooses its 37 delegates in a painstaking, multi-part process. Each of the state\u2019s seven congressional districts voted for three delegates at party meetings in March. An additional 13 delegates were selected at the April convention. The final three slots go to top state party officials. Gardner responded to what he described as Trump\u2019s social media \u201ctemper tantrum\u201d with a series of nine taunting tweets. He asked the man who is now the presumptive Republican nominee for president how he could possibly protect Israel, balance the federal budget, and handle Russian president Vladimir Putin if he can\u2019t navigate Colorado politics? Paulo Sibaja, a small business owner and political consultant acknowledged that Trump is \u201ctrying to be a sharper candidate\u201d but said he had a lot of work ahead of him, to attract moderates, bring the important Hispanic vote into the fold and overcome this Colorado faux pas. \u201cTo me it is extremely disrespectful for anyone to come into a state and begin to tell those of us who have dedicated a big part of our lives to it that we\u2019re wrong,\u201d said Sibaja, who has served as a Hispanic advisory board member for the Colorado Republican party. \u201cWe\u2019re very independent,\u201d Sibaja said. \u201cDon\u2019t tell us how to run our state. Don\u2019t make fun of our state.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
