He returned the compliment by prising a first home league win of the season from the grasp of Tony Pulis\u2019s side and inspiring Everton to a remarkable victory. There are no favours in the Premier League. Everton were two goals down and second best when Lukaku scored 27 seconds after Craig Dawson had appeared to put the contest beyond them. It proved a turning point. The Belgium international followed with an assist for Arouna Kon\u00e9 before completing Everton\u2019s first victory from a two-goal deficit away from home since 1985. Both Lukaku goals stemmed from superb crosses from Gerard Deulofeu on the right while, in an inexperienced and makeshift Everton defence, the 19-year-old Brendan Galloway excelled. The positives and the performance were thoroughly unexpected after a flat opening from Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s team. \u201cRom was a completely different player in the second half,\u201d said the Everton manager. \u201cThe overall performance of the team in the first half was a little bit off. We were sloppy and sluggish. We didn\u2019t react quick enough. But we reset at half-time and Rom, like every player, had a different intensity in the second half. Rom has the unique strength of being the man the team needs. He has an elite brain. When he puts his mind to it he can achieve anything.\u201d With Lukaku\u2019s mind on taking his tally to six goals in all competitions this season Everton delivered a win that will massage confidence before Sunday\u2019s Merseyside derby. It also demonstrated the improved resources at Mart\u00ednez\u2019s disposal with Kon\u00e9 and Darron Gibson impressing off the bench and several youngsters producing mature displays. For Pulis, however, his first managerial defeat from a two-goal lead was hard to take. Saido Berahino\u2019s clinical opener was the only quality on show before the interval. Dawson\u2019s header should have been the cue for victory but his team switched off and threw Everton a lifeline. \u201cWe were still celebrating without concentrating,\u201d he said of Lukaku\u2019s swift response. Pulis added sourly: \u201cWe had good chances before our second goal but after that we switched off. It didn\u2019t help that we lost Gareth McAuley to injury yesterday and Jonas Olsson after about 15 minutes. Their second goal was offside. Marginal but off, and I\u2019m told Lukaku handled the ball in the build-up to their third. They\u2019ve had the fortune and we haven\u2019t.\u201d Albion\u2019s confidence was high following last Saturday\u2019s cherished win at Aston Villa, where Berahino had reintegrated himself in the best way possible with the winning goal, and they were offered encouragement by an inexperienced Everton defence. John Stones\u2019s failure to recover from a knee injury sustained in the Capital One Cup victory at Reading meant a full Premier League debut for Ramiro Funes Mori, the \u00a39.5m signing from River Plate. It was the first time Mart\u00ednez had started without his dependable axis of Stones and Phil Jagielka since a 5-2 defeat at Dynamo Kyiv in March and, with Seamus Coleman also failing to recover from a hamstring problem, Tyias Browning made only the second league start of his Everton career. \u201cOnly Phil Jagielka and Tim Howard were the two left to give any direction to the youngsters,\u201d said Mart\u00ednez. \u201cIt was incredible the way they coped. Brendan Galloway made a tackle in the second half [on Berahino] that was the difference between losing and winning this game.\u201d Funes Mori started well only for the Argentinian\u2019s composure to desert him during a careless spell before half-time. After embarking on a long run out of defence the 24-year-old lost possession to Dawson and Gareth Barry compounded Everton\u2019s problems with a loose ball inside that picked out James Morrison. The Scotland international threaded a perfect pass into Berahino\u2019s darting run into the Everton area and Howard was powerless to prevent a first-time shot finding the net. More slack defending presented Albion with a second goal shortly after the restart. Both Jonny Evans and Darren Fletcher were granted free headers from a Berahino corner and, though the latter\u2019s diving effort was heading harmlessly wide, the visitors\u2019 defence cleared for another corner from the right. This time Chris Brunt delivered an inswinger, Dawson lost the over-employed Jagielka at the back post and steered a textbook header down and beyond Howard. Albion celebrations were still in full flow when Lukaku hauled Everton back into the game with a towering header. The centre-forward had been on the margins on his return to the club where he scored 17 goals in the 2012-13 season but rose above the substitute James Chester to steer an excellent Deulofeu delivery past Boaz Myhill. Lukaku created what should have been a decent opening for James McCarthy when he threaded a pass into the midfielder\u2019s run into the box. The Republic of Ireland international took possession but also a pathetic dive over a non-existent challenge from Craig Gardner to earn a booking. The thoughts of the watching Ireland management team of Martin O\u2019Neill and Roy Keane would have been illuminating. Mart\u00ednez said: \u201cI think James was expecting a challenge that didn\u2019t happen. I don\u2019t encourage my players to do that but mistakes happen. The referee handled it well.\u201d By now Lukaku had become the game\u2019s dominant force. Turning away from two Albion defenders, the Belgian picked out Kon\u00e9 with another perfectly weighted pass into the area. This time the Everton player elected to stay on his feet and gave Myhill no chance with a powerful finish from close range. With six minutes remaining Deulofeu sent over another tempting cross and Lukaku stole in ahead of Chester again to beat Myhill at the second attempt. Rickie Lambert should have levelled in the dying moments but the former Liverpool striker shot wide from 12 yards. The comeback could not be contained."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
