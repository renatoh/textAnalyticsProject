He has also become a stick with which to beat other managers. Whenever a coach pleads for more time to embed his ideas, adapt to the loss of players or integrate new ones, impatient folks can reach for Koeman, point to the job he has done so far at Southampton, then wallop the whiny other manager. Things are going so swimmingly that even the managers of Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur, the only sides to have beaten Southampton this season, are among the victims of Koeman-inspired bashing. This win over Leicester City, Southampton\u2019s 11th in their past 12 in all competitions and their fourth league game in a row without conceding a goal, gave even more kudos to Koeman. Victory was secured by goals from the only one of the manager\u2019s recruits about whom there had been doubts. Shane Long was Saints\u2019 most expensive summer signing, arriving for \u00a312m from Hull City in a transaction widely used as a benchmark of Premier League extravagance. \u201cIf Shane Long is worth \u00a312m, then so-and-so is worth at least \u00a3100m,\u201d became a common line on radio phone-ins and the like. The Irishman has rarely been prolific and his failure to find the net in his first nine Premier League matches for his new club did nothing to make such quips go away, even though his energetic performances were generally good. Koeman knew the striker would improve because the manager has worked hard to teach him a new style in which to play. Long has always been a willing runner, harassing opponents relentlessly but Koeman wants him to be more savvy in the way he expends his energy. Whereas Graziano Pell\u00e8, the other striker bought in the summer, had worked previously with Koeman, Long had to adjust to new methods. This, then, was an instance where even Koeman needed time to get his ideas across. The two fine finishes that thwarted Leicester\u2019s attempt to frustrate their hosts suggest it has been well spent. \u201cWe do a lot of position games and position training sessions and he was not used to doing that always,\u201d Koeman said of Long. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about running in football. OK, you need to run to get behind the ball, you need physical strength but I am a coach who likes to have and to dominate the ball and that\u2019s all about good positions. It\u2019s not running. The more you run, the less you see. And that was difficult for Shane in the beginning but little by little he\u2019s improving. And we\u2019re very happy to have a player like him in the squad.\u201d Koeman said that although Long was bought primarily as a centre-forward, where he has spent most of his career, the plan was always to develop him into a player who can be deployed anywhere across the front line. Pell\u00e8\u2019s success means Long has so far been stationed out wide, which is where he was used after replacing Sadio Man\u00e9 on Saturday. The way he broke the deadlock in the 75th minute, darting in off the wing to meet a lay-back from Pell\u00e8 and curl a lovely shot in the far corner, was encouraging to Koeman. \u201cI spoke to Shane before we signed him and the first option is to play in the No9 position as the target man which Graziano Pell\u00e8 plays. But he can play behind Pell\u00e8, which we did for the Capital One Cup game against Stoke [when Long scored], and he can play from the left and the right wing position. I know he\u2019s not really a wing player but he scored the first goal, that we like to have. His understanding is much better than in the beginning and he made the difference.\u201d Long is grateful both for his manager\u2019s approach and for the fact all the summer changes at the club meant he felt under less pressure than he might otherwise have done. \u201cLuckily the focus hasn\u2019t been on me individually,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has kind of been on us as a team with so many players leaving and so many players coming in and everyone expecting us to have a bad season. To be fair to the manager, he has blended the players well. It doesn\u2019t just happen on a Saturday, you know, we do put a lot of work into how we play football.\u201d Man of the match Ryan Bertrand (Southampton)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
