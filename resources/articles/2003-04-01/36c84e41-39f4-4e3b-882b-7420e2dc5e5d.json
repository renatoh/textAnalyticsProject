The National Association of Pension Funds has told the firm it does not believe its senior 'independent' non-executive director, Sir Richard Giordano, really is independent. The NAPF says Giordano has now held this post for more than 10 years, giving rise to concern that he is too closely associated with Rio Tinto's management. The recent Higgs report on the role of non-executives suggested a time limit of two or three years, and certainly no more than six. Shareholder activists contend that non-executives who stay at firms for a long time cannot bring the critical eye of someone who has recently been on the outside. The NAPF says Giordano cannot be viewed as independent for another reason: Rio Tinto's chairman Sir Robert Wilson is also a non-executive at BG, the oil and gas company that Giordano chairs. An NAPF spokesman said: 'There is a risk that some could see the relationship [between the two men] as too cosy, too clubby.' Rio Tinto rejects the NAPF's stance, but was unavailable for a detailed comment. Wilson and Giordano are viewed as heavy hitters. 'They have done more than most to keep their companies at the top of their respective trees,' said one observer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
