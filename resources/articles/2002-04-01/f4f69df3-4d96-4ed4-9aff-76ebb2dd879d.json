Pretty it was not, but Munster are in the Heineken Cup for the second time in three years and their loyal supporters are beginning to believe in fairytales. While no one would ever claim Mick Galwey's men are the planet's most dazzling rugby team, few can match either their pride or possess a stronger umbilical cord binding them to their public. Already there is talk of 40,000 Irishmen descending on Cardiff next month and their desire to bid a fitting farewell to their departing coach, Declan Kidney, and folk hero Peter Clohessy, should not be underestimated. It was precisely this inner desperation which tipped the scales on a warm, breezy Saturday in B\u00e9ziers when French hopes, for once in a season where their national team have matured so impressively, withered disappointingly on the vine after a decent start. Once the tumult had died down it emerged that Ronan O'Gara kicked his six vital penalties and the late conversion of John Kelly's injury-time try despite a knee that needed 13 stitches. \"How he managed to kick all those penalties is beyond me,\" said Kidney, echoing the testimony of the referee Chris White who revealed O'Gara was literally roaring with pain as he hurled his body yet again into the fray in the final moments. As for Clohessy, the second-degree burns he suffered to his right arm less than three weeks ago did not stop him landing a serious punch on his opposing prop, Brent Moyle, in the first half. These are battle-hardened men aware this is their final chance to deliver Munster's holy grail. The Castres captain, Gregor Townsend, confessed many of his own team already felt they had blown it at half-time when they led only 9-6. Townsend, who will announce this week that he is returning home to Scotland to play for the new Borders professional team, is also aware that putting theory into practice is not always easy against Kidney's well-drilled unit. \"You have to impose your game otherwise Munster will take charge. \"They wait for mistakes, they're very good at regrouping and they've got a game-plan which they stick to.\" They also have young talent emerging. Paul O'Connell, covered in factor 32 suncream to protect his fair skin, and the impossibly fresh-faced Donncha O'Callaghan were outstanding, and it was O'Connell's rousing late lineout steal which snuffed out any hope of a Castres fightback prior to Shaun Longstaff's irrelevant consolation try. Kidney, even so, will hope that Anthony Foley's damaged shoulder recovers and that former Wallaby Jim Williams should be available after a calf problem. Eleven of the side should feature in the Irish club final between Cork Constitution and Shannon this weekend and Kidney then has one game against Ulster in Belfast the following Friday prior to the final. \"Hopefully we won't have to wait until we've lost another final to learn how to handle them,\" said Kidney, aware his side will need to improve on their showing against Northampton two years ago. Castres, in contrast, cannot now qualify for next year's tournament but the memory of Romain Teulet's goalkicking style will endure. It is little wonder the French media compare the five-foot six inch full-back to Asterix; on this occasion, however, it was Munster's own-brand of magic potion which carried the day.
