Asmae Moussaoui, 43, also says she believes Saudi Arabia told the Moroccan government to silence her husband, Taoufik Bouachrine, 49, shortly before he was taken into custody. Bouachrine, the editor and co-founder of the liberal Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Al Yaoum, was arrested in February 2018 after the publication of editorials in his newspaper which were critical of the Moroccan government and also of Saudi Arabia. He was accused of multiple counts of rape, sexual assault and people-trafficking. Independent observers were banned from the trial hearings which took place last November, at the conclusion of which Bouachrine was given a 12-year sentence. His detention and trial were condemned by the UN human rights council working group, and led to cross-party calls for his immediate release by royal pardon. However, the Moroccan government has consistently insisted his trial was fair. When the Guardian asked about his wife\u2019s claims that ministers were pressured by Saudi Arabia to act against Bouachrine, it declined to comment. Instead, the Guardian\u2019s email requests were leaked to the Moroccan news website Le360.ma, which accused Moussaoui of a shameful attempt to try to bring international attention to the case. Moussaoui approached the Guardian to describe the warnings she says were given to her husband by Khashoggi, a family friend, despite what she feels has been pressure from the Moroccan authorities to abandon her efforts to highlight the case. According to Moussaoui, who is a civil servant, Khashoggi had warned her husband on numerous occasions that he was not safe in Morocco and that his \u201clife was threatened and he had to be cautious\u201d. She also says the Moroccan government was under pressure from Saudi Arabia to silence her husband because he was being critical of the kingdom. She told the Guardian that her husband had confided to her that Saudi Arabia had \u201ccomplained about me\u201d to the Moroccan government. The complaint had been made on behalf of the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who was said to be \u201cfurious and enraged because of what [Bouachrine had] published on him\u201d, according to the account by Moussaoui. In a statement to the Guardian, she said her husband had told her the Moroccan government had replied to the Saudis: \u201cWe are going to handle this journalist\u2019s case our way.\u201d Bouachrine\u2019s legal team says some of the messages from Khashoggi are likely to be on his mobile phone, which was confiscated at the time of his arrest. His lawyers have asked police and prosecutors to release an unredacted call log which will help them show who he was talking to, and where, as they try to appeal against his convictions. So far, they have only been provided with a partial report of his mobile phone activity. In a recent submission to Dr Agnes Callamard, UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, lawyers acting for Bouachrine described his arrest and trial as a \u201cpolitically motivated prosecution\u201d that could be linked to his criticism of Saudi Arabia in articles published between October 2017 and January 2018 \u2013 a month before his arrest. \u201cIt is wholly conceivable that there has been a pattern of behaviour by the Saudi authorities in targeting dissidents and journalists, not only those who are directly connected to Saudi Arabia, but also those other individuals such as Mr Bouachrine, who are active in the Arab world,\u201d the letter said. The UN human rights council working group has said the evidence in the case against Bouachrine, which includes grainy video footage, \u201cis highly contested and clearly not conclusive\u201d. The group said there appeared to be \u201crepeated cases of intimidation and coercion by the national authorities\u201d to ensure his conviction. Bouachrine said the man seen in the video was not him and that the people filmed seemed to engage in sexual acts consensually. His Moroccan lawyer Mohammed Ziane told the Guardian that of the 15 original complainants, only five remained. \u201cThere is no conclusive evidence [against Bouachrine], none that would be considered acceptable from a legal point of view,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo of the alleged victims have not provided any date or circumstances or medical statements or third-party testimonies in their accusations. The three others pretend to prove their case with videos that were brought to the case outside of any legal procedure. \u201cWe contest the authenticity of the videos. Taoufik Bouachrine categorically denies [being in them]. These videos do not show, by image or sound, any threat or coercion. \u201cAny document that could prove his innocence has been redacted or dismissed and any request for a complementary investigation or new legal procedure that might help us show the truth is systematically refused.\u201d One of his alleged accusers was sentenced to six months in jail after she filed a complaint against the police claiming her statement was falsified. Afaf Bernani published her account on YouTube, saying she had refused to go along with the police when officers tried to include her among a group of women alleging Bouachrine had abused them. In a statement to the Guardian, she said: \u201cI\u2019ve refused to accuse Taoufik Bouachrine of anything because he never harmed me in any way. So they falsified my statement. \u201cI then filed a complaint for forgery against the police \u2026 but finally, I am the one who finds herself condemned to six months in jail for contempt charges. \u201cI am frightened for myself and for my family. On the internet, at the tribunal, I am regularly insulted because I dared to complain about the judicial police and because I did not want to accuse Taoufik. Every day, they do their best to destroy my honour by deliberately lying about me. They are gangsters who want to kill the press.\u201d The Moroccan government declined to answer questions from the Guardian, having initially said it would do so. It has previously rejected all criticism of the arrest and treatment of Bouachrine. It has also dismissed the concerns of the UN, reportedly saying the findings of its working group were not backed with solid evidence, and sometimes relied on details to incite public opinion against governments. The Saudi authorities did not respond to requests for comment. Last week Callamard published a 100-page report on the murder of Khashoggi in which she highlighted a \u201cglobal pattern of threats against journalists and media workers\u201d by states who did not like what they were writing. In recent months, dissidents and activists in a number of countries, including Norway and Canada, have accused Saudi Arabia of launching sophisticated hacking attacks against them. Last week, the Guardian revealed that it had been told a cyber unit within the kingdom had been tasked with hacking its servers. Saudi Arabia declined to comment on any of these claims."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
