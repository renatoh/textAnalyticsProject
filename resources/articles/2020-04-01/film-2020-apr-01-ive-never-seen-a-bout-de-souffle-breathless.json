Or, I hadn\u2019t, until this assignment. I know, embarrassing, especially for a so-called film critic. I\u2019ve long blamed this gap in my knowledge on the fact that I didn\u2019t take a first year university course in French New Wave cinema, but I know as well as anyone you don\u2019t need to be a student to study. It\u2019s not even that the Nouvelle Vague is a blind spot, necessarily \u2013 I\u2019m an admirer of other films from the movement, such as Alain Resnais\u2019s Hiroshima Mon Amour, Agn\u00e9s Varda\u2019s Cl\u00e9o de 5 \u00e0 7, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut\u2019s Jules et Jim and Jacques Demy\u2019s The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. I\u2019ve been known to treat my lack of interest in Godard\u2019s filmography as something of a comedy bit, joking that I simply prefer Truffaut (he\u2019s less of a basic bitch). With French film journal Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma (RIP) back in the news after its writers quit en masse this February, it feels like an appropriate time to revisit some of the film-makers made famous by the magazine following its launch in 1951. Rohmer, Rivette, Chabrol, Truffaut, and, yes, fine, Godard, were early champions of auteurism, the theory that the director is king. Now the most widely accepted way to read a film, at the time it represented radical rejection of commercial cinema, which tailored to a studio\u2019s whims and centred on the screenwriter. And so, with some trepidation, I cued up Godard\u2019s first and most famous film, his 1960 debut \u00c0 Bout de Souffle. I know this film, I thought, despite never having watched it. I know the monochrome imagery, the jump cuts, the cigarette dangling from Jean-Paul Belmondo\u2019s mouth. I know Jean Seberg\u2019s Breton stripes, her gamine pixie haircut and her New York Herald Tribune T-shirt. What I didn\u2019t know was what the film was actually about. Something about a guy, and a girl, and a car, I\u2019d guessed. Turns out, I wasn\u2019t far off. Michel (Belmondo) steals a car and shoots a policeman; attempting to lay low in Paris, he ends up in the hotel room of former fling Patricia (Seberg), an American studying at the Sorbonne. The plot is inspired by film noir, but the v\u00e9rit\u00e9-style handheld camera, real locations and naturalistic speech transform it from a pulpy gangster thriller into a hangout movie. There\u2019s sex, betrayal and an antihero to anchor the narrative, but hard-boiled dialogue is swapped for digressive, philosophical rambling, in-jokes and winking addresses to the audience. \u201cI\u2019m a sonofabitch,\u201d Michel says, direct to camera. Ah, I realised. This is what people mean when they say Godard changed the grammar of cinema. Godard\u2019s influence on New Hollywood cinema and directors such as Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman and Brian de Palma started to become clear, especially in the constant chatter and casual violence. And, I guess, the sexism. Michel is a self-described scumbag but it doesn\u2019t quite let him off the hook for declaring all women drivers \u201ccowardice personified\u201d, refusing to pick up two female hitchhikers because they\u2019re \u201ctoo ugly\u201d and the fetishisation of Patricia\u2019s constituent body parts. I imagine Godard thought it romantic to describe the lovely \u201cgleam\u201d in Patricia\u2019s eyes that emerged when she was \u201cafraid and confused\u201d. I found it disturbing. In another scene, Patricia is trying to have an intelligent conversation about William Faulkner. \u201cShow me your toes,\u201d replies a horny, distracted Michel (hello, Quentin Tarantino). Still, I didn\u2019t hate it. I didn\u2019t hate it at all. I found myself drawn in by the irrepressible buoyancy of its narrative rhythms. I liked how the improvised jazz score creates the feeling of spontaneity. I was into the spirited sexual energy that animates the film and, clearly, the film-maker as Paris entered a new decade after the stifling conformity of the 1950s. Which Godard film shall I watch next?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
