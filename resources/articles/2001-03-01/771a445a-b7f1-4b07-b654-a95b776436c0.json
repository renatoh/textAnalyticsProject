The results will not be officially released until next year, but home secretary Jack Straw recently said that minority ethnic communities total more than 5m people in Britain. This represents 10% of Britain's total population. The last census - which was conducted in 1991 - estimated that Britain's minority ethnic communities accounted for 7% of the total population, about 3.5m people. The figure in London now stands at around 20%, according to Mr Straw. In some areas - including his parliamentary constituency of Blackburn, Lancashire - it was more than 50%. Race relations and racial discrimination now has a higher profile to reflect these figures. Yet the issue of institutional racism remains a key issue with Britain's ethnic minority groups. The racist murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993 and the Metropolitan police's inability to secure any convictions for this crime has acted as a symbol that racism remains a problem in Britain today, and that public bodies do not take the issue seriously. Two years ago, Sir William Macpherson published his report, following his official inquiry into this murder. He made 70 recommendations for improving the investigation of racially motivated crimes. While his report looked at institutional racism within the police, it also had widespread implications for other public authorities. Local councils have since drawn up action plans for tackling racism in the light of the report. William Hague and the Conservatives argue that tackling institutional racism in such a manner will exacerbate the problem and create a backlash among some police officers. The government, for its part, has passed the Race Relations Amendment Act. This act comes into force in April. It attempts to stop racism within the public sector. Unlike the 1976 Race Relations Act - which largely concerned itself with the private sector - the new act forces hospitals, police forces, prisons, schools, universities and other public bodies such as the BBC to take measures to promote good race relations. The government has published a consultation document which outlines how it intends to implement these measures. This report states that racial discrimination is \"unacceptable\" and is outlawed in public bodies. Moreover, public authorities now have a general duty to promote racial equality. They must also be proactive in seeking to avoid unlawful discrimination before it occurs and monitor their workforce to ensure that ethnic minorities are treated fairly. Jack Straw has acknowledged that this is a particular problem as less than 2% of senior civil servants are from ethnic minorities at the moment. The Commission for Racial Equality has also been given powers under the new act to take any public body to court if believes it is not fulfilling its duties to promote race relations. How long it takes for ethnic minorities to receive fair treatment from public bodies - indeed whether they experience any change in treatment - will be the key factor in determining whether the battle against racial discrimination is being won. In the meantime, the leaders of the five leading political parties have promised to take action against candidates or campaigners who stir up racial prejudice during the forthcoming general election. Yet with a bitter contest expected and differences of issues such as asylum likely to be aired, the issue of race may still come to the surface."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
