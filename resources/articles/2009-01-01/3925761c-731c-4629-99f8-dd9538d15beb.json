Sam Allardyce's principal objection to the sale of Santa Cruz is the limited time he would have to bring in a replacement. Sunderland have rejected a bid for El Hadji Diouf, whom Allardyce managed at Bolton. City have offered Tal Ben Haim as part of a deal for Santa Cruz and are ready to release Nedum Onuoha, another defender, as an alternative. Allardyce, however, has his eye on Sturridge, 19, a high-class product of the City academy, \"I don't think it is fair to say we are playing hardball,\" said Allardyce. \"Our evaluation is that Roque is worth more to us playing here than any money we might get for him. If we do sell, that money has to be spent very quickly. If you ask me whether I can find a player to replace him, the answer will be that I wouldn't be able to find one between now and the end of the transfer window.\" In Benni McCarthy and Jason Roberts, who have scored five times between them in his three league games in charge, Allardyce has a solid first-choice forward pairing. Should Santa Cruz leave he would have as principal cover only Matt Derbyshire, the England Under-21 striker whose form this season has been erratic. Sturridge, who scored against Blackburn last month, is in the final six months of his contract at City. His manager, Mark Hughes, said it was inexplicable that a player of Sturridge's potential should have been allowed to run his contract down. He is keen for him to agree a new deal. However, a deal involving Sturridge, either as a permanent transfer \u2014 which City would be reluctant to sanction \u2014 or on loan would be attractive to Blackburn. Allardyce said that he saw two resolutions to the Santa Cruz situation \u2014 either the Paraguayan remaining at Ewood Park and deciding his future in the summer, or leaving now, for a large sum. An offer \"well in excess of \u00a312m\" has already been rejected. \"It is down to Manchester City to make the offer and blow us out of the water,\" Allardyce said. \"My advice to [Santa Cruz] is to stay at Blackburn, get fit [the forward is recovering from a calf injury], score goals to help us stay in the Premier League and see what the summer brings.\" Allardyce accepts that he is unlikely to persuade Sunderland to part with Diouf unless he too produces an offer which \"blows them out of the water\". Rather mischievously, given that Hughes has rejected any suggestion that City are fighting to preserve their Premier League status, Allardyce agreed with the notion that Blackburn should not do business with one of their relegation rivals. \"That is true,\" he said. \"We have already let them off the hook with a draw and we were better than them on the day. We don't want to sell any of our players to one of our rivals in what will be a close fight for survival.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
