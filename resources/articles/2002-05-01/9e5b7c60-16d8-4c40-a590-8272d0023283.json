Details are sketchy at the moment, but it looks like some kind of hub or aggregator for weblogs. It's an interesting idea, already being explored by Daypop and Blogdex, although I think the people currently best positioned to do something really exciting with this are making the web services and software that publish blogs today. Those bits of software are handling, directly, all those ideas, opinions, facts and links people put in their blogs every day, and sending them out on to the web. That direct relationship with the raw material of personal publishing puts them in the driving seat if they look to do interesting things with all that data flowing through - like indexing it, syndicating it, and offering ways to combine it with the similar efforts of other bloggers. Maybe Nick's going to try and strike a deal with the likes of Blogger - its CEO, Evan Williams, expressed an ambition to do more with all the stuff flowing through his servers when I met him at the start of the year (right at the end of this piece). It's the kind of thing which could take blogging, personal publishing, hey - the web itself - to the next level, if done well."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
