Maybe he didn\u2019t. Either way, Emmanuel Macron set France and Europe on a new collision course with the Islamic world last month \u2013 all in the name of freedom. Last week\u2019s spate of lethal terror attacks suggests the French president may have started something he cannot finish. Macron\u2019s impassioned speech on 2 October, vowing to fight \u201cradical Islamism\u201d, eradicate \u201cseparatism\u201d and uphold secular values at all costs, foreshadowed this latest crisis. It was seen at the time as a mainly domestic political exercise, intended to spike the guns of France\u2019s far right before his 2022 election campaign. But Muslim leaders were enraged by Macron\u2019s description of Islam as a faith \u201cin crisis all over the world\u201d that had, in effect, been hijacked by extremists. Then, two weeks later, after the murder of a Paris schoolteacher, Samuel Paty, by a foreign-born Islamist, an undaunted Macron doubled down. His defence of the notorious, recently republished Charlie Hebdo caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, which Paty had shown to pupils, and a national crackdown on mosques, imams and Islamic groups added fuel to the fire. France itself was \u201cunder attack\u201d, Macron dramatically declared, a phrase he repeated on Thursday. Political and religious leaders from Bangladesh to Jordan and anti-French demonstrators publicly vented their fury, accusing him of doing \u201cSatan\u2019s work\u201d. Much of what he said was misunderstood or purposefully distorted. Truth was a casualty, too. Yet the fact remained: by loudly and uncompromisingly championing French values, Macron had managed simultaneously to outrage mainstream Muslim opinion and, apparently, to energise extremists. The immediate, grim result, which fairly or unfairly will be laid at his door, was a string of attacks in Nice, Avignon and Saudi Arabia. France, struggling to contain a worsening Covid pandemic, is now on its highest terrorism alert, with schools and churches under armed guard. Macron cannot be faulted for sticking up for the French post-Enlightenment ideal of an equal, integrated, secular and republican society. But he and other European leaders now face a possibly powerful Islamophobic, anti-Muslim backlash that could spawn yet more bloodshed. This sudden explosion of violence and recrimination potentially affects everyone. All of Europe\u2019s governments risk being drawn into a deepening polarisation, with evident implications for peace, security and social cohesion. Like France\u2019s National Rally (formerly the National Front), German, Italian and other far-right Islamophobic and anti-migrant populist parties whose public support has been falling of late must be licking their lips. Muslim leaders such as Pakistan\u2019s Imran Khan have seized on the affair to deflect anger over their own failings. Macron\u2019s critics will say this is what comes of having an imperious president-in-a-hurry, pushing to seize the reins of European leadership. Macron wants to turn the EU into a more powerful, independent bloc that stands up for itself against the US, China \u2013 and Islam. But the price tag for his neo-Gaullist European vision keeps rising. Europe\u2019s most determined opponents have meanwhile spotted an opportunity. Chief among them is Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Turkey\u2019s president. He suggested Macron was mentally unbalanced. \u201cOur history is one of a battle against tyranny and fanaticism,\u201d Macron responded via Twitter. No prizes for which tyrant and fanatic he was talking about. Erdo\u011fan is a deeply unpleasant, authoritarian Islamic nationalist. But in one respect, he and Macron are alike. Erdo\u011fan also casts himself as a pan-regional leader, as a tutor and defender of the Sunni Muslim world. This ambition was symbolised by his provocative re-designation of Istanbul\u2019s former cathedral, Hagia Sophia, as a mosque. Forget Trump v Biden \u2013 Erdo\u011fan v Macron is the heavyweight bout of the year. The two have already gone several punishing rounds over disputed gas reserves in the eastern Mediterranean, Libya, Syria and Nagorno-Karabakh. At Macron\u2019s urging, December\u2019s EU summit will discuss sanctions on Turkey. Yet two men\u2019s clashing ideas and geopolitical rivalries do not explain the depth and breadth of Muslim-world fury. That stems from dismay felt by the overwhelmingly nonviolent Muslim majority about entrenched European Islamophobia, racial discrimination, cultural insensitivity, and heartless migrant policies. Further afield, perceived French neocolonialism in the Sahel and apparent western indifference to the endless horrors in Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, Myanmar and Xinjiang feed tensions. For many Muslims, the projection of the Prophet Muhammad caricatures on to the walls of several French cities after Paty\u2019s death was intolerable. Yet so, too, was the attack on a Nice church. On both sides, lack of respect is a big part of the problem. The destructive impact of Covid-19 has frayed tempers further, putting governments and citizens everywhere under pressure. Into this giant mantrap Macron has jumped feet-first, increasing, not reducing, misunderstanding at a time of extreme stress. A Pew Research survey last year found that solid majorities of people in the UK, France, the Netherlands, Germany and Sweden hold positive opinions of Muslims in their country. In Italy and southern and eastern Europe, there is greater negativity. Although far-right populist parties continue to exploit fears about identity and immigration, especially among less-educated and older people, and although recorded incidents of Islamophobia are up, overall tensions have fallen compared with five years ago. On the other hand, the French policy mandating assimilation into a prescriptively \u201clay\u201d society \u2013 unlike British-style laissez-faire multiculturalism \u2013 appears too rigid. Macron should think again about how it is applied. It\u2019s plain the relationship between Muslims and non-Muslims in Europe remains fragile. The danger is obvious. Will the bitter furore over Macron\u2019s justified but clumsy defence of French values, the perception Islam is under assault, and the ensuing terror, tip Europe into a new, confrontational downward spiral?
