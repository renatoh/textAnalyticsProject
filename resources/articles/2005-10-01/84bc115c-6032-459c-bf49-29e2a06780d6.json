The limiting factor you do not explore is the educational and skills background required to make use of the information technologies. You discount the digital divide within developed countries without recognising the link between digital exclusion and social exclusion. Effective searching of the internet requires high-order information literacy skills - skills that are far from universal. While most young people now leave education with at least survival ICT skills, many adults were not taught them. The government is attempting to make ICT skills training available to all, but mostly narrowly linked to job-related skills: far too little to ICT skills for personal development and for being an active e-citizen. These aspects are crucial if people who currently have quiet voices are not to be completely silenced in the digital age. Mike Cushman Department of Information Systems, LSE Children were an early driver of digital television, so it is no surprise that in their teens they have a closer relationship with niche channels (BBC risks losing touch with younger generation of viewers, October 7). It also confirms what those niche channels have been saying to government and to Ofcom over the future of public service broadcasting - that in order to engage the growing group of viewers who don't watch traditional television, they will have to consider new ways to reach them. As we have argued, a public-private partnership with niche channels may be the way forward. Niche channels can offer opportunities for imaginative and efficient ways of distributing public service programming to non-traditional audiences. Their flexibility enables them to reach target groups over time with repeat patterns or through a range of brands with different demographics. Charlotte Wright Satellite and Cable Broadcasters Group MIT is about to produce a not-for-profit laptop for \u00a356. My computer requirements are simple: word processing and internet access. I suspect I am not alone. Is it not possible for a British company (or university) to produce a similar basic machine at a reasonable price and still make a profit? The sophistication of machines today is far beyond the needs of many and may act as a deterrent to some. Michael Sheahan London"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
