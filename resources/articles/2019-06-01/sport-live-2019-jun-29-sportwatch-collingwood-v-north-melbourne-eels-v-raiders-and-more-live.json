It\u2019s time for me to log off for the night and savour another salvo of Mitchell Starc\u2019s missiles. Remember, you can follow all that action via the link below. I\u2019ll catch you again here soon. Women\u2019s World Cup 2019: If that wasn\u2019t enough live sport to digest of a Saturday evening, why not gorge yourself some more with a World Cup quarter-final liveblog? Yeah, it started raining again during the final quarter so that goal blitz of the third term pretty much settled the contest. For the Bulldogs it means only a second ever win at Adelaide Oval and lifts them one win outside the eight. For Port Adelaide it\u2019s a massive comedown after such a stirring victory over Geelong last time out. Credit to anyone who turned up and sat through two hours of relentless sheeting rain. Do you own this as well? Collingwood have finally been put out of their misery on a wretched night at Marvel Stadium. Beaten all over the ground by a resurgent North Melbourne, the Pies lost two players to first-half injuries and now face the prospect of a treacherous month of footy undermanned and out of form. The Kangaroos were not flattered by the scoreboard and the dramatic impact of Rhyce Shaw shows no sign of abating. The Roos are now just a game outside the eight. The worst sort is the best sort. Mr Stewart is always welcome at any party of mine. Cricket: Never mind the calamities befalling other nations, Australia are in action from 10.30pm in a top-of-the-table clash against New Zealand. Of course there\u2019s a live OBO to chart this trans-Tasman tete-a-tete and Geoff Lemon is already on deck setting the scene. Cricket: Afghanistan are now 134-5 against Pakistan, which in context means the prospect of England somehow outdoing themselves in terms of World Cup humiliations remains very much on. AFL: 3QT: Port Adelaide 5.8 (38) v 8.3 (51) Western Bulldogs - Conditions have improved somewhat since half-time which has led to improved ball movement and heavier scoring at Adelaide Oval. The Doggies still have their noses in front though despite Port Adelaide dominating the inside-50 count. Back to songs about footballers, this is a belter from 1970. Quite the turnaround up in Darwin and it ends with Parramatta sneaking into a playoff spot despite finding themselves down by 16 points after half-an-hour. Canberra looked destined for second spot on the ladder but were unable to respond to a four-try blitz in 29 minutes either side of half-time. It\u2019s the first time the Eels have won consecutive matches since round two. You can imagine the look on Ricky Stuart\u2019s face. AFL: 3QT: Collingwood 4.4 (28) v 8.14 (62) North Melbourne - This is turning into a filthy night for the Pies. They\u2019ve played listlessly, lost two starters to injury, and now they\u2019re finally being punished on the scoreboard. Geelong look set to end the round with their two-game buffer at the top of the ladder restored. Tennis: Before the footy forces me to stop getting distracted by Wimbledon, I want to share this entertaining listicle of All England Club curios. NRL: 64 mins: Eels 18-16 Raiders - Would you believe it? From 0-16 down after half-an-hour, Parramatta have stormed into the lead at TIO Stadium. Tennis: The women\u2019s singles has also thrown up an amazing draw with the youngest player in the field facing the oldest in the opening round. Tennis: Wimbledon begins in a matter of hours and it promises to be the most interesting in over a decade for Australian tennis fans with Ash Barty heading to SW19 the no.1 seed in the women\u2019s singles. The French Open champion sat down with Kevin Mitchell recently to share the story of her extraordinary rise to the top. \u201cThe most important thing is all the people around me I trust,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are genuine, real human beings. So, besides the tennis, we have relationships off the court first and foremost \u2013 and then the tennis comes second. Every single member of my team is like family to me.\u201d I clicked on that link and immediately made the of noise a satisfied house cat. This is exactly the content I logged on for. AFL: More bad news for the Pies. They\u2019re down to two on the bench for the second half. AFL: HT: Port Adelaide 2.5 (17) v 5.2 (32) Western Bulldogs - When I picture Adelaide Oval in my mind I see warm South Australian sunlight glinting off the lettering on the Chappell Stand, hazy wide shots of a sleepy cathedral spire, and a batsman - any batsman / all batsmen - accumulating runs in short sleeves. Tonight could not be further from that summertime fantasy. Somewhere amongst the deluge a game of footy is taking place, and the Bulldogs are winning it. Cricket: And if riffing on England\u2019s pain is your weekend pick-me-up, Barney Ronay is also in fine form. What system is being exemplified here? What message would it send out if England were to become world champions? Neglect the grassroots. Retreat from state schools and inner cities. Give up on the poor. Hurl the carved wooden chairs into the fire, gurgle down the last of the claret from the cellar. Enrich yourself, while making the one thing you have to give invisible. And yes, you still get to win the World Cup. Cricket: If you only do one thing this weekend set aside ten minutes in a comfy chair and luxuriate in this wonderful piece of writing by Geoff Lemon on the glory that is Mitchell Starc dismissing Ben Stokes in the Cricket World Cup. Starc is long and lean, a figure stretched out like a Quentin Blake drawing. He lopes to the crease before slinging his arm over with what seems complete ease. Often the ball curves through the air. It may not need to pitch, with plenty of Starc full tosses swerving past a groping shot to strike halfway up a stump. In the 2015 World Cup he bowled a dozen batsmen, including New Zealand\u2019s captain to seal the final. The summer afterwards he warmed up with half a dozen matches up in the 50-over domestic competition for 26 wickets, 17 of them bowled. AFL: HT: Collingwood 3.3 (21) v 4.8 (32) North Melbourne - The Pies still haven\u2019t got their heads properly in this contest but the Roos remain unable to put them to the sword. Despite almost 70% game time in attacking territory and dominating inside-50s 33-16, North Melbourne only have a modest lead at the main break. NRL: HT: Eels 12-16 Raiders - That was a half of two halves up in Darwin with Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad, Jack Wighton, and Sebastian Kris all crossing early to put Canberra on course for second spot on the NRL ladder but tries to Manu Ma\u2019u and Blake Ferguson in the shadow of half-time have set up the second term beautifully. AFL: Bad news for Collingwood. AFL: QT: Port Adelaide 1.2 (8) v 3.2 (20) Western Bulldogs To continue the theme, Port Adelaide could do with Noah stopping by the city of churches to round up a couple of pedigree Bulldogs because the visitors are building a handy lead in the first quarter. The extravagantly talented Marcus Bontempelli needs pairing up at the very least, he already has 12 disposals, ten of them contested, not to mention a game-high four tackles. Cricket World Cup: If you\u2019re in the Anyone But England camp you can raise a wry smile because Pakistan have just snagged two quick Afghanistan wickets at Headingley. Follow all that in detail here: AFL: QT: Collingwood 1.3 (9) v 2.7 (19) North Melbourne - Not the start Collingwood fans were hoping for against the Kangaroos but it could have been much worse had North kicked straight in that opening quarter. Ben Brown in particular was guilty of some poor finishing with a ten point margin scant reward for double the Pies\u2019 total of inside-50s. AFL: Q1: 15 mins remaining: Port Adelaide 1.1 (7) v 0.1 (1) Western Bulldogs - And while we\u2019re zipping around the grounds a quick check on the situation at Adelaide Oval where it is absolutely bucketing it down. The rain is so fat in the floodlights it looks like golf balls firing out of a driving range bucket-filling machine. Do not hold your breath for a skills clinic. NRL: 5 mins: Eels 0-6 Raiders - Our first stopover at TIO Stadium in Darwin is to report an early score for the Raiders. Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad has already crossed for the Canberrans as they search for the two points that will likely send them second on the NRL ladder. Netball: Australia\u2019s Diamonds were farewelled at a lunch in Sydney earlier this week before flying to the UK for the 2019 World Cup. Meanwhile, arch rivals New Zealand wound up their preparations with a loss to the New Zealand men\u2019s team in the final of a four-team tournament in Auckland. In netball\u2019s version of the battle of the sexes, the men pulled clear in the second half to prevail 66-54, two days after they\u2019d won their first meeting 54-50. The tournament gave coach Noeline Taurua\u2019s team the tough workout she was after, with the Silver Ferns having success in games against Fiji and a Kiwi All Stars side. The two men\u2019s matches were challenging, against opponents who were bigger and more athletic than the leading women. Maria Folau landed 40 from 43 shots in what was potentially her last big game on New Zealand soil. Veteran shooter Folau, captain Laura Langman and former skipper Casey Kopua are all likely to retire following next month\u2019s World Cup in Liverpool. New Zealand and Australia have contested the last five World Cup finals, with the Diamonds winning four of them. However, the Silver Ferns\u2019 recent struggles have dropped them to fourth in the world rankings, behind Australia, Commonwealth Games champions England and Jamaica. With AAP. Cricket World Cup: The first of the day\u2019s two matches is underway with Pakistan aiming to ramp up the pressure on England when they take on Afghanistan at what is sure to be a partisan Headingley. Follow all the action on the dedicated liveblog right here: AFL: Collingwood v North Melbourne is underway at Marvel Stadium with the Magpies bidding to keep pace with Geelong at the top of the ladder. The Cats\u2019 hard-fought victory over the Crows last night sent them two games clear in top spot but the Pies can bring that back to one with a result tonight. Collingwood begin the night level on points with West Coast after the Eagles secured a stunning late victory over Hawthorn at the MCG earlier in the day. The Hawks were ahead for a large chunk of the final quarter but a Jamie Cripps goal with just 69 seconds remaining sealed the deal for the premiers. The Crusaders have done it - again - holding off a spirited fightback from the Hurricanes in a superb exhibition of Super Rugby in Canterbury. The dominant force in Super Rugby are through to their 14th final and will be hot favourites to defend their title on home soil against the Jaguares. The scoreline looks comfortable for the hosts but Newcastle made heavy weather of seeing off Brisbane at McDonald Jones Stadium. An 18-point half-time lead looked to have the game sewn up but a James Gavet sin-binning and a couple of Broncos tries put the game in the balance late on before Mason Lino put the result beyond doubt. A few fisticuffs at the final siren livened up the home crowd as the Knights returned to fifth spot on the ladder. The Broncos remain two wins outside the playoffs. Sydney\u2019s slim finals hopes remain alive after they ground out a victory over Gold Coast at the SCG. After an even opening couple of quarters the Swans broke clear in the third and never looked like relinquishing control. Super Rugby: 70 mins: Crusaders 27-26 Hurricanes - The second semi-final in this year\u2019s Super Rugby is destined to go down as one of the all-time great club matches. The two Kiwi heavyweights have traded blows all night long in Christchurch, scoring some thrilling tries along the way - and it isn\u2019t over yet. Edge of the seat stuff for the right to host the Jaguares in the decider. Good evening everybody and welcome to Saturday sportwatch. It\u2019s a feast of footy tonight headlined by the AFL. We\u2019ll wrap up Sydney v Gold Coast shortly before Collingwood take on North Melbourne from 7.25pm and Port Adelaide host Western Bulldogs at 7.40pm. Over in the NRL we\u2019ll tick off the Knights v Broncos then switch our attention to a pair of finals contenders when the Raiders visit the Eels around 7.35pm. In amongst all that we\u2019ve got some scintillating Super Rugby semi-final action to get our heads around as well all the latest from the Cricket World Cup, including build-up to Australia v New Zealand at 10.30pm Then there\u2019s F1, Wimbledon, the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup and whatever else catches your eye over the course of the night.
