But football offers no greater problem for anyone with ethical and moral views than anything else. The traditional dilemmas over buying certain products based on the company producing them are found in football, with the views of many an owner, the behaviour of players, the tax-avoidance by millionaires and the rest presenting an unedifying spectacle. The solution is a mixture of pragmatism and action. Pragmatism, because you can't boycott everything, and, as many fans will tell you, ceasing to support a club on the basis of owner is allowing that owner to trample over the years of support you've put in. You were there before the millionaires arrived, and you'll be there afterwards. The action ranges from small things - supporting fair-trade footballs - to bigger-scale projects, where you organise with fellow fans to concentrate ownership in the hands of the community of fans and prevent clubs being bought and sold on the open market. Why did Roman Abramovich not buy Real Madrid? Because he can't, because their fans own them, as they do at nine clubs across the UK, thanks to the efforts of Supporters Direct and fans who've taken their clubs into their hands. Finally, Busfield raises the issue of whether fans could afford the wages in a future when they might own clubs; the problem for most clubs is that they can't afford them as it stands now. Bringing clubs' finances into line with what their fans can afford to pay might start to address the question of wages, not to mention the extortionate cost of attending a match.
