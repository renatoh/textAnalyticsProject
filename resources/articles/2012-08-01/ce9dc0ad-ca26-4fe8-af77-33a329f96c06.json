Unfortunately, while winning events is nice, being the host entails a little more than simply eating well, a fact London would do well to remember. The London Olympic store ran out of British flags over the weekend, an utter embarrassment. I understand that the athletes have been reticent to sing along to \"God Save the Queen\", leading to perhaps the most mindless controversy in recent memory over a supposed lack of national pride, but someone, somewhere, should have foreseen a spike in patriotism nonetheless and stocked up on flags. Or maybe they were all sent back to the manufacturers early last week when the country was still snivelling over their middling medal count. Britain's feeling a lot better now, of course, but the South Korean fencer Shin A-lam remains inconsolable after her hopes of reaching the gold medal match in her event were bungled by the 15-year-old volunteer put in charge of keeping time. Like any 15-year-old can be expected to do, the boy drifted off into lala land \u2013 perhaps after noticing that the women were wearing white trousers \u2013 and he failed to restart the clock with one second to go in a match Lam was leading. Lam's German opponent landed the winning touch in the time outside of time. One wonders how many other members of London's Olympic staff are under the voting age. Might that explain the utterly execrable colour scheme? Teenage girls love hot pink, after all. Thinking about it, London is lucky the Olympic logo isn't simply a sketch of One Direction surrounded by hearts. The poor fencer was left on the sidelines for over an hour, weeping as the officials sorted out her appeal. And when it was denied, she remained there long after the 15-year-old had been picked up by his mom and driven to football practice, eventually escorted off the piste a security detail that likely included the actual timekeeper, re-assigned by London's shameful security shortage. Later, the committee offered Lam a special consolation medal, thinking that a commemorative reminder of the time her Olympic dream was ravaged by their ineptitude might make her feel better. They also offered her a framed 8x10 of her tear-stained face, signed by everyone who was there that day. Unsurprisingly, she did not accept their insipid and insensitive offer. South Korea (also known as North Korea to some British flag-raisers) did manage to steal a bit of karmic retribution in men's football when they eliminated Team Great Britain on penalties. With that, as well as the British women bowing out to Canada \u2013 who only just recently won our first gold, so unformidable are we \u2013 it's evident that football remains Britain's sport of preference primarily for masochistic reasons. Britain may be flying high right now, but \"some things never change\", as Gary Lineker said following the football team's elimination. Among the things that didn't change this weekend: the underwhelming quality of these Games.
