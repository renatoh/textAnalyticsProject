Just recently, my father was kept overnight in the hospital because he lost feeling in his left arm due to a high blood pressure episode. He is travelling from Mexico to Miami this week. Is there anything he should be aware of? Aline Dr Jules Eden replies: It is essential that your father only flies if his blood pressure is under control. It sounds like he had a TIA, or transient ischaemic attack, where a small part of a clotted artery gets loose and can end up temporarily blocking a vessel in the brain. Hence the symptoms. There is a risk this can happen again if his BP is not under control. The effects of this can be worsened by the relative lack of oxygen in the plane. The chance of a DVT could be higher if he has poor vessels, too, so I think the best option is for him to take aspirin daily before flying, and to get a local doctor to check his blood pressure a few days before travel. If it is still above 160/100, forget the flight and start on an anti-hypertensive. \u00b7 Recently, I was treated for scabies by a GP. I applied the cream that I was prescribed for the first time last week and am planning to repeat this in the next few days. But the rash on the inside of my leg appears to be getting worse. Any thoughts? Dr Jules Eden replies: Scabies is a common problem for travellers. This can be contracted either through sexual activity or from using the unwashed bed sheets of an infected person. The scabies mite burrows under the skin around the wrists, ankles and groin. At night, it pops out and lays eggs on the skin surface. These are highly irritant. You scratch, the eggs get re-implanted under the skin, and so the cycle goes on. The treatment, though, is relatively simple: two applications, neck to toe, of an anti-scabies lotion over a 48-hour period. I think your problem is that you have left it too long between applications of the lotion. Re-apply the lotion as soon as possible, keep it on for a day, wash off and re-apply. Do not forget to wash any clothes and sheets at a high temperature, too. And look out for symptoms in any one you have had close personal contact with.
