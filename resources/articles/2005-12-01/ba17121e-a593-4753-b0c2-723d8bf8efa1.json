Election officials in the self-rule provinces of Dohuk, Irbil and Sulaymaniyah estimated a turnout of 75%-80%, while in the contested city of Kirkuk, which has a large Kurdish population, polling was described as \"huge\". \"I am voting for my future and for the future of my people who have suffered so much from central rule,\" said Shwan Mohammed, a history student at Sulaymaniyah University, as he queued outside a polling station clutching the Kurdish flag. As with the campaign in Iraq's most stable region, voting passed off largely without incident. In the worst trouble residents of a village outside Arbil threw rocks at a convoy carrying the head of an Islamist Kurdish group running against the major Kurdish alliance. Kurdish leaders also complained that thousands of people had been deprived of the right to vote because of mistakes in the electoral roll made by the Independent Election Commission in Baghdad. The Kurdistan Alliance, dominated by Massoud Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party and Jalal Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, hopes to repeat its strong performance in Iraq's first post-war elections in January. In that poll it emerged as the second largest bloc in parliament and formed a coalition government with the winning Shia alliance. With greater Sunni Arab participation this time around the Kurds, who make up a fifth of the population of Iraq, expect to lose some of their 77 seats, but seek to at least protect their political gains enshrined in the new federal constitution. In the northern city of Sulaymaniyah one of the first to vote as polls opened was Iraq's Kurdish president Jalal Talabani. \"It is a historic day for Iraq and the region,\" he said, before alluding to some of the political battles that lie ahead. \"I hope that the Iraqi people will stay united. We hope that the people will vote to keep the constitution that was approved by the Iraqi people.\" A steady trickle of voters in the morning turned into a flood at midday, as entire families - men in baggy traditional trousers, women in sequinned dresses, turned up to vote. Outside polling stations policemen linked arms and danced. \"Who can say it was wrong to bring us freedom?\" said Barham Salih, Iraq's planning minister, as he watched the celebrations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
