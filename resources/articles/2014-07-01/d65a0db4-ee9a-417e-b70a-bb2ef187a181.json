Carissimi's Jephte is under 25 minutes and also ends with a chorus of weeping on the death of Jephte's daughter. To these affecting narratives (separated by instrumental interludes by De Brossard), La Nuova Musica bring superbly straight tone, unerring tuning and plangent phrasing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
