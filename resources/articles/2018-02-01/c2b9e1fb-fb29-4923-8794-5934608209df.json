The speech, to be delivered to the Sydney Institute on Tuesday, reportedly blasts the national energy guarantee and criticises Coalition ministers for not taking up the cause of cutting immigration. On Monday Abbott seized on comments from the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, that the intake should be reviewed and will now call for a specific target of 110,000, down from the current levels of 190,000. According to extracts of the speech in the Australian and the Daily Telegraph, the former prime minister will call for the substantial reduction \u201cat least until infrastructure, housing stock and integration has better caught up\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a basic law of economics that increasing the supply of labour depresses wages, and that increasing demand for housing boosts price,\u201d Abbott says. Labor\u2019s shadow assistant treasurer, Andrew Leigh, says an OECD survey of academic studies found that migrants had minimal impact on housing prices and studies of the impact on wages had mixed results, with many showing migration had a positive effect. Abbott champions the figure of 110,000 because it is the long-term average during the 11 years of the Howard government, although an analysis by the parliamentary library shows the figure is weighed down by low numbers in the early years and migration had risen to 160,000 by 2006-07. He will say that despite concerns about housing affordability and wages \u201cno one on the frontbench of government or opposition had been prepared to raise the one big contributing factor that is wholly and solely within the federal government\u2019s control \u2014 until Peter Dutton finally said last week that immigration could be cut if it\u2019s in our national interest\u201d. Since 2017 Abbott has suggested a reduction as part of a \u201cconservative manifesto\u201d to win back Coalition voters, including those who intend to vote for One Nation, whose leader, Pauline Hanson, advocates stopping migration. \u201cIn order to win the next election, the government needs policy positions which are principled, practical and popular,\u201d he will say. \u201cAnd if they also outrage the Labor party, so much the better. Scaling back immigration acknowledges that government\u2019s first duty is to its own citizens.\u201d The Daily Telegraph reported that Abbott will criticise the \u201cglib talk\u201d of politicians and, in a veiled criticism of the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, warn that \u201call too often \u2026 the people charged with sorting out our difficulties don\u2019t have to suffer them\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to be relaxed about green scheme-driven price hikes when you\u2019re on a big salary,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to dismiss street crime when you live in an upmarket suburb and don\u2019t have to use public transport or drive long distances for work. \u201cHence the insiders versus outsiders chasm now bedevilling the politics of the west: a talking class that\u2019s never had it so good; a working class that\u2019s trying harder and harder just to keep up; and a welfare class with a strong sense of entitlement.\u201d Abbott will reportedly criticise the national energy guarantee, claiming it sounds \u201cwonderful\u201d but lacks any explanation as to how it would bring down prices. He will suggest something is \u201cfundamentally wrong\u201d when Australia has \u201cthe world\u2019s highest energy prices\u201d despite large reserves of coal, gas and uranium. \u201cOur emissions obsession has made coal taboo, so policy makers pretend that a combination of wind and gas generation can keep the lights on and prices down even though most states are making further gas production almost impossible,\u201d he says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
