Trash hopes that its secret weapon will be \u201ccomputational cinematography\u201d: the app, which entered closed beta on Monday, uses machine learning \u201cto automate the un-fun parts of video editing\u201d, automatically processing video to cut together short clips with a consistent mood and feel. A similar approach, computational photography, has already radically changed smartphone photography, enabling features such as the Pixel\u2019s Night Sight and iPhone\u2019s Portrait Mode. Trash\u2019s co-founder, Hannah Donovan, who was Vine\u2019s last general manager before the service was shut down by its owner, Twitter, said she hoped the approach would lower the barrier of entry to video editing. \u201cWe\u2019re analysing the video for a bunch of different things,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cSome are obvious computer vision concepts like \u2018does this video have a face?\u2019 Others are from our ontology of cinematographic concepts \u2013 for example, \u2018is this a close-up shot?\u2019 Based on what the computer \u2018sees\u2019 in the video we synthesise it into a rough cut and sync it to music for you to play with and change.\u201d An early employee at Last.fm and co-founder of music-based social network This Is My Jam, Donovan said there was still room for niche social networks. \u201cThe goal of the platform right now is to show/inspire people around what they can make. While it\u2019s true that we might be feeling like we\u2019ve reached our limit on social media and content consumption, to believe that people are done with creative expression would be to give up on humanity. People are always going to make things and share to express themselves, it\u2019s just a question of how.\u201d After it launched in 2013, Vine soon attracted an enthusiastic following. The app, which allowed users to shoot and post six-second videos, became the most downloaded on the iOS App Store within months, and created a host of social media celebrities, including Logan and Jake Paul, Nash Grier and Brittany Furlan. But the service lost those stars to Twitter and Instagram as they struggled to monetise their newfound fame, and was shut down by Twitter in 2016 when the company moved to bring the remainder of its celebrities on to the main network. Vine\u2019s co-founder, Dom Hofmann, attempted to launch a successor app, called V2, in mid-2018, but the launch was delayed due to funding difficulties. In April this year, the app, renamed Byte, began beta testing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
