The hosts overcame a first-leg deficit to set up a meeting with Manchester City at Wembley next month with Sarri\u2019s players reacting impressively after the head coach suggested they had lacked motivation and fight in losing meekly at Arsenal on Saturday. Sarri stressed he had not been seeking to criticise his team, but pointed to this victory as potentially being restorative in terms of Chelsea\u2019s progress this season. \u201cIn the last three or four matches, we had problems,\u201d he said. \u201cOne was the motivation, and the other problem was that the players stopped having fun on the pitch. \u201cSo I think that now, with this performance and the result, we can find enthusiasm again. So it\u2019s very important. My players reacted really well tonight, but we need to have motivation with continuity now. We played with another mind. With another motivation. With another determination.\u201d Eden Hazard, restored on the left, had inspired the home side to a 2-0 half-time lead with Sarri having suggested in the build-up that, while a wonderfully gifted player, the Belgium captain is far from a natural leader in this squad. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d said Hazard when asked about his head coach\u2019s assessment. \u201cI just play my football. It doesn\u2019t matter what the manager said. I just focus on my football and want to do my best for this team.\u201d Spurs, already without the injured Harry Kane and Dele Alli, and absent Son Heung-min, ended up restoring parity in the tie only for Eric Dier and Lucas Moura, the latter denied by Kepa Arrizabalaga, to miss in the shootout. This was the first year that the away goal rule has not applied in the semi-finals of this competition since 1980. \u201cWe made an unbelievable effort,\u201d said Mauricio Pochettino, whose side have now lost domestic semi-finals in each of the last three seasons. \u201cThis season we are fighting not only with the opponents but with everything that\u2019s happened. That is not an excuse. It\u2019ll make us stronger. We have three more competitions, still, and I can only feel proud of the performance and the way we competed.\u201d Tottenham, who travel to Crystal Palace in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Sunday, lost Ben Davies to a slight groin injury and Moussa Sissoko to fatigue."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
