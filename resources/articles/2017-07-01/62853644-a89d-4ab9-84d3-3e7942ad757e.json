Wu Ching-kuo will be asked to step down after 13 members voted to pass a motion of no confidence in the president with a further two abstaining from voting at a meeting of executive committee members in Moscow on Monday. There will also be an extraordinary congress in the coming months where Wu will be asked to explain alleged financial irregularities at the organisation, concerns first raised by individuals speaking to the Guardian. A senior figure in the organisation said: \u201cThere will be an extraordinary congress in the next few months with all the national federations present. This will address three agenda items. One is that the president explain the financial irregularities. The executive committee will also be presenting our concerns and the third is a no-confidence vote in the president. \u201cThe majority of the executive committee have just had enough and we\u2019ve got to correct what has gone on. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s happened overnight. It\u2019s been going on for a long time and enough is enough. Major changes are needed and there is more to come. It\u2019s poor governance and it\u2019s pretty much become a one-man show with a couple of staff.\u201d It follows claims made to the Guardian by another senior figure in the organisation that Aiba faces the risk of bankruptcy after demands it immediately pays back millions of pounds in loans and investments it does not have. There is a deep schism in Aiba with two officials having resigned after claims they were sidelined by the president. Another executive committee member was also removed by Wu after raising questions about possible \u201cdeficiencies and irregularities\u201d in Aiba\u2019s finance and governance \u2013 before being dramatically reinstated by Swiss courts this week. Aiba is no stranger to controversy. At the Rio Olympics last summer the organisation was pilloried after a series of dubious decisions. The Irish boxer Michael Conlan claimed he had been \u201crobbed\u201d in his fight with the Russian Vladimir Nikitin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
