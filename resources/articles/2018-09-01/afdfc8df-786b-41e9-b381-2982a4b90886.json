Lloris, who will miss Tottenham\u2019s Premier League trip to Brighton on Saturday as he targets a return at Huddersfield on Saturday week, was stopped at the wheel in the small hours of 24 August. The club captain was found to be more than two times over the limit and, having entered a guilty plea at Westminster magistrates court on 12 September, he was fined \u00a350,000 and banned from driving for 20 months. He was also fined two weeks\u2019 wages by Spurs, roughly \u00a3250,000. The question of how Lloris would cope mentally with the fallout from the affair has rumbled on. Pochettino showed great faith in him when he kept him in the team \u2013 and as captain \u2013 against United but he has now conceded Lloris might not have been in the right frame of mind to play. It should be noted that Lloris made one particularly vital save in the 3-0 win. \u201cHe was under stress during the game against United,\u201d Pochettino said, while acknowledging that Lloris had been beating himself up over the saga. \u201cI think the added stress maybe created the injury.\u201d Lloris appeared to suggest on 11 September that the injury was not too serious. He said there \u201cmay be a chance\u201d he could play in the game against Liverpool, which was last Saturday. That did not happen. \u201cWhen will he be back? It is a point that we still do not know,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cWe think the plan is still next week if everything goes to plan in training.\u201d The manager suggested Lloris\u2019s lay-off was allowing him to process everything that had happened. \u201cThe injury is helping him to take time and think and be a little bit more relaxed,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cTo compete after what happened was a massive stress for him.\u201d Lloris would most likely not have played anyway in the Carabao Cup third-round tie next Wednesday against Watford in Milton Keynes which, if Tottenham win, could lead to a fixture headache. Because of the ongoing delays with the new White Hart Lane and an NFL game at Wembley, Spurs have had to move their home league fixture against Manchester City to Monday 29 October. It will be played at Wembley. But the Carabao Cup fourth round ties are slated for 30 and 31 October, with Tottenham playing at Wolves on Saturday 3 November. City, who play at Oxford in the third round next Tuesday and face Southampton at home in the league on 3 November, are in the same situation. If they and/or Spurs won through to the fourth round, the most realistic window for the ties to be squeezed in would be Thursday 1 November, meaning three games in six days for them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
