Haley, who left the administration last year, makes the claim in a book, With All Due Respect, that will be published on Tuesday, the Washington Post reported. In Haley\u2019s telling, Tillerson told her that if Trump was left unchecked, people would die. \u201cKelly and Tillerson confided in me that when they resisted the president, they weren\u2019t being insubordinate, they were trying to save the country,\u201d Haley writes. The pair told her that \u201cit was their decisions, not the president\u2019s, that were in the best interests of America\u201d and \u201cthe president didn\u2019t know what he was doing\u201d. Haley\u2019s claims add to a picture of the White House as a hive of insurrection, with former business leaders, diplomats, career politicians and aides attempting to stymie the wilder impulses of a wildly unconventional president. In September 2018, Watergate reporter Bob Woodward published Fear, an account of Trump\u2019s first year in power in which senior aides were reported removing documents from the Resolute Desk. Two books by Michael Wolff, Fire and Fury and Siege, have painted a similar picture of dysfunction, faction and chaos. Another new book on the Trump presidency is due on 19 November. A Warning, by an anonymous administration official, has been extensively reported. Among its contents is a description of a president spiralling from crisis to crisis \u201clike a 12-year-old in an air traffic control tower\u201d. The author, who last year produced an explosive column in the New York Times, reportedly claims that some White House officials drew up plans for a mass resignation, or \u201cmidnight self-massacre\u201d, to draw attention to Trump\u2019s behaviour. Tillerson, who was secretary of state from 2017 until he was fired by tweet in March 2018, reportedly while on the toilet, did not respond to requests for comment, the Post said. But Kelly offered a pseudo-confirmation of Haley\u2019s claims, saying that if providing the president \u201cwith the best and most open, legal and ethical staffing advice from across the [government] so he could make an informed decision is \u2018working against Trump\u2019, then guilty as charged.\u201d Kelly recently earned Trump\u2019s ire by telling an audience in Georgia the president faced impeachment because he had not listened to his former chief of staff\u2019s advice. Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, writes that she agreed with many of Trump\u2019s most controversial decisions, including pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord and relocating the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Speaking to the Post, Haley said that though she opposed Trump\u2019s infamous request to the Ukrainian president for a public investigation into Joe Biden, a political rival, \u201cit\u2019s hard for me to understand where the whole impeachment situation is coming from, because what everybody\u2019s up in arms about didn\u2019t happen\u201d. Trump and senior aides are alleged to have withheld nearly $400m in military aid and dangled the prospect of a White House meeting, in a clear quid pro quo. Public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry will begin this week. \u201cDo I think the president did something that warrants impeachment?\u201d Haley asked. \u201cNo, because the aid flowed. And, in turn, the Ukrainians didn\u2019t follow up with the investigation.\u201d In her book, the Post said, Haley does show herself standing up to Trump, including over his relationship with Russian president Vladimir Putin and over what she calls his \u201cmoral equivalence\u201d in blaming \u201cboth sides\u201d after a white supremacist march in Charlottesville turned deadly in August 2017. \u201cA leader\u2019s words matter in these situations,\u201d she writes. \u201cAnd the president\u2019s words had been hurtful and dangerous. I picked up the phone and called the president.\u201d Haley also discusses her response as governor to a mass shooting at an African American church in Charleston, South Carolina, in the summer of 2015. In the aftermath, she says, she was treated for post-traumatic stress disorder. Haley has been talked of as a possible replacement for Mike Pence as Trump\u2019s vice-president but her report of Tillerson and Kelly\u2019s efforts is likely to ruffle presidential feathers. She adds that she argued that Trump had been elected, so if they disagreed with his policies strongly enough, they should quit. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t get my arms around the fact that here you have two key people in an administration undermining the president,\u201d Haley told the Post."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
