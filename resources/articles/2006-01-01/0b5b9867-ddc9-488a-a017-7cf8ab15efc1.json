The survey, used by advertisers to assess the readership of newspapers and magazines, suggests the overall readership of national newspapers declined over the six-month period - a trend that accords with the latest sales figures. But parts of the quality press enjoyed impressive rises in readership. The Independent was up almost a quarter compared to the same period the previous year, while the Guardian rose by 17%. The Independent was boosted by a rise in popularity among women, with its female readership up 40%. All the red-top newspapers suffered falls, with the Sun down 20%. But the FT was the worst affected national newspaper, down 30%. The paper has also suffered falls in its ABC circulation figures in recent months, particularly in Britain. The survey is based on personal interviews with more than 30,000 people chosen as a representative sample of the adult population of Great Britain. Among the Sunday newspapers, the Observer rose by 29%, the Independent on Sunday by 16% and the Sunday Times by 8%, but the Sunday Telegraph was down 15%. The News of the World, People and Sunday Mirror and People were all down, with the News of the World losing 11% of its readership. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
