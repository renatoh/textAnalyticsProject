Here\u2019s an updated summary of the day\u2019s key developments from today\u2019s bloggers, Lois Beckett and Sabrina Siddiqui. Former vice president Joe Biden joined calls Alexander Acosta\u2019s resignation, following the controversy over the labor secretary\u2019s role in cutting a plea deal with financier Jeffrey Epstein in 2008; as a reminder, Epstein has been charged with operating a sex trafficking ring involving underage girls. Donald Trump is so far sticking by Acosta, who as a US attorney helped Epstein avoid a public trial and lengthy prison sentence more than a decade ago. A federal judge blocked the Trump Justice Department\u2019s attempt to change the lawyers on its legal team in a lawsuit over the Trump administration\u2019s effort to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census, a move that civil rights activists say would have a chilling effect on the effort to accurately count all Americans, including immigrants. The Trump administration is planning to speed up its screening of asylum-seekers at the US-Mexico border, Buzzfeed News reported. Immigration advocates said the move would give asylum-seekers, largely fleeing violence and poverty in Central America, less time to prepare for interviews and recover from the treacherous journey. Donald Trump\u2019s 4 July \u2018Salute to America\u2019 cost the Pentagon $1.2m; the figure did not reflect the cost to US taxpayers. Trump has said he will repeat the controversial event next year. The entrance of billionaire Democratic donor Tom Steyer into the 2020 Democratic presidential primary was met with some skepticism and frustration from the left. West Virginia senator Joe Manchin unveiled a bill that would withhold \u201cany and all\u201d federal funding for the 2026 World Cup, which the US will host, until the US Soccer federation to pay its men\u2019s and women\u2019s team equally; the US women\u2019s national team earned their fourth World Cup title last week. Early today, billionaire Democratic donor Tom Steyer formally launched his campaign for president. The reaction from some progressives has not been positive. New York Times opinion columnist Jamelle Bouie, who has written frequently about voter suppression, argued that Steyer\u2019s money would be better sent on registering and turning out voters. More than 300,000 people have signed a petition asking McDonald\u2019s and Burger King to stop giving plastic toys to children, The Hill reports. The Change.org petition, written in the names of two British children, argues that: \u201cchildren only play with the plastic toys they give us for a few minutes before they get thrown away and harm animals and pollute the sea.\u201d \u201cBig, rich companies shouldn\u2019t be making toys out of plastic at all,\u201d the petition notes. The Guardian\u2019s Susie Cagle reported recently on the overwhelming problem of plastic waste. Country rock band Confederate Railroad has been barred from performing at an state fair in Illinois because of its use of the Confederate flag, the Associated Press reports. Illinois\u2019 governor cancelled the band last week. \u201cThis administration\u2019s guiding principle is that the state of Illinois will not use state resources to promote symbols of racism,\u201d a spokeswoman for Gov. J.B. Pritzker said. Some Republicans in Illinois have pushed back, with one arguing that other state fair musical acts were equally worthy of censorship. One Republican pointed to Snoop Dog, who recently released an album whose cover features the rapper standing over a corpse toe-tagged with Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s name. Another band scheduled to play at the state fair released a statement in solidarity with Confederate Railroad: \u201cThis \u2018political correctness\u2019 has to stop. It\u2019s tearing our country apart.\u201d The spokesman for the House Intelligence Committee has offered a rare comment about a witness interview. Felix Sater, the Moscow-born businessman at the center of the Trump Tower Moscow project, \u201chas not fully cooperated with the committee,\u201d the spokesman said, per Politico\u2019s Andrew Desiderio. Activists who have been pushing for Congress to declare a climate emergency are rallying at the Capitol to support the resolution introduced today by senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, and representatives Earl Blumenauer and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The group Extinction Rebellion in a press release said it plans to \u201ccelebrate the initiative of these select Congress people and to reiterate our demand that the rest of Congress acknowledge the severity of the climate crisis by quickly codifying the resolution into law.\u201d Protester Dominic Serino called the resolution, which would not require specific action, \u201can important first step if it were to pass.\u201d \u201cI think our Congress and other leaders habitually lie to us about the gravity of the climate crisis,\u201d Serino said. After the Supreme Court blocked the Trump administration\u2019s first attempt to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 United States census, the Justice Department announced this weekend that it was appointing a new team of lawyers to take over census-related cases. The Justice Department offered no rationale for the change in its legal team. Some observers, including election law expert Rick Hasen, called this a troubling move, one that suggested that the Justice Department\u2019s career attorneys might not be willing to go forward with the Trump administration\u2019s plans for the next step of continuing to fight to add a citizenship question to the Census, as the president had said he wanted to do, despite the first Supreme Court ruling. Civil rights groups have argued that asking about citizenship status may discourage immigrants from participating in the census, producing an undercount of immigrants, particularly immigrants of color, in official tallies. An undercount of immigrants could result in lower funding numbers for government funding and program allocations, and could also have electoral benefits for the Republican Party. But tonight, a federal judge in New York blocked the Justice Department\u2019s move to change its legal team. The 2020 census tallies will be used in the once-a-decade process of redrawing and updating America\u2019s electoral districts, which are supposed to guarantee that all voters have equal representation in the political system-- \u201cone person, one vote.\u201d Undercounting immigrants in the census could dilute their political power for the next decade. Lois Beckett here taking over our live politics coverage from The Guardian\u2019s West Coast bureau. There are moments in American politics these days when it\u2019s hard to process the contrast between the actual news that\u2019s happening, and the business-as-usual, feed-the-news-cycle approach of some political figures. One of these moments came this evening. Earlier, Kellyanne Conway, one of President Trump\u2019s most prominent counselors and surrogates, referred to a disagreement between five Democratic congresswomen as a \u201chuge catfight\u201d on Fox News. What Conway called a \u201cmajor \u2018meow moment\u2019\u201d was the public disagreement between four freshman progressive Democrats and Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi over whether Congressional Democrats were doing enough to protect migrants at the border, particularly migrant children, from mistreatment and abuse by the US government. \u201cKeep my name out of your lying mouth,\u201d one of the freshman congresswomen, Ayanna Pressley, responded. \u201cRemember that time your boss tore babies from their mothers\u2019 arms and threw them in cages?\u201d she tweeted. Last month, a US federal watchdog recommended that Trump fire Conway for repeatedly violating a law that limits political activity by government workers. Ok folks, that\u2019s it from me (Sabrina) for today. A big thanks to my colleague Lauren Gambino for also briefly taking the reins of the blog -- you can credit her for bringing you the latest on Joe Biden! Before I hand the blog over to my colleague Lois Beckett on the West Coast, allow me to summarize the past few hours: Former vice president Joe Biden joined calls Alexander Acosta\u2019s resignation, following the controversy over the labor secretary\u2019s role in cutting a plea deal with financier Jeffrey Epstein in 2008; as a reminder, Epstein has been charged with operating a sex trafficking ring involving underage girls. Donald Trump is so far sticking by Acosta, who as a US attorney helped Epstein avoid a public trial and lengthy prison sentence more than a decade ago. The Trump administration is planning to speed up its screening of asylum-seekers at the US-Mexico border, Buzzfeed News reported. Immigration advocates said the move would give asylum-seekers, largely fleeing violence and poverty in Central America, less time to prepare for interviews and recover from the treacherous journey. Donald Trump\u2019s 4 July \u2018Salute to America\u2019 cost the Pentagon $1.2m; the figure did not reflect the cost to US taxpayers. Trump has said he will repeat the controversial event next year. West Virginia senator Joe Manchin unveiled a bill that would withhold \u201cany and all\u201d federal funding for the 2026 World Cup, which the US will host, until the US Soccer federation to pay its men\u2019s and women\u2019s team equally; the US women\u2019s national team earned their fourth World Cup title last week. Lois will take you through the rest of the day, so stay tuned ... and until next time from Sabrina! Donald Trump\u2019s 4 July \u201cSalute to America\u201d cost the US military $1.2m, the Pentagon said Tuesday. The event sparked controversy for its use of taxpayer dollars and putting the president at the center of the holiday celebrating American independence. The Pentagon figure did not reflect the cost to American taxpayers. It instead detailed the amount of money spent on the transportation of military equipment and flying hours. Trump touted the strength of the US military at the event and issued a rare plea for unity. Despite the criticism he faced by some for \u2018hijacking\u2019 the 4 July holiday, the president announced plans on Monday to repeat the military salute next year. \u201cIt was a wonderful day for all Americans,\u201d Trump said at the White House. \u201cBased on its tremendous success, we\u2019re just making the decision and I think we can say we\u2019ve made the decision to do it again next year, and maybe we can say, for the foreseeable future.\u201d Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat of West Virginia, has a plan to force the US Soccer federation to pay its men\u2019s and women\u2019s team equally: hit \u2018em where it hurts. The West Virginia senator introduced a bill on Tuesday that would withhold \u201cany and all\u201d federal funding for the 2026 World Cup, which the US will host, until the organization agrees to pay the teams equally, according to the HuffPost. That would include includes \u201cfunds that go to host cities, participating local and state organizations, US Soccer, the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football, and the international soccer governing body FIFA,\u201d the report says. \u201cThe clear [equitable pay between the US men and women\u2019s soccer teams is unacceptable and I\u2019m glad the US Women\u2019s Soccer Team latest victory is causing public outcry,\u201d Manchin said in a statement to the news website. \u201cI\u2019m encouraging everyone to call their Senator and Representatives to help us get this bill passed and finally pay the equitable pay they deserve.\u201d Last weekend, the US women\u2019s national team clinched their fourth World Cup title while raising awareness about the pay disparities between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams. Before the tournament, 28 members of the team sued the US Soccer Federation for gender discrimination in violation of the Equal Pay Act and the Civil Rights Act. The team\u2019s co-captain Megan Rapinoe, who was awarded the Golden Boot and the Golden Ball, has said she would not accept an invitation to the White House and encouraged her teammates to follow suit. On Tuesday, the Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer announced that Rapinoe had accepted an invitation to raise the issue on a tour of the US Senate. Congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley have also invited the team to tour the House. \u201cWorking class\u201d Joe reported earning $15.6m in the two years after he left office, according to tax returns his campaign released on Tuesday And $2.8m of that came from speaking and writing engagement. Former Vice President Joe Biden has joined several of the 2020 candidates in calling on Labor Secretary Alex Acosta to resign. Donald Trump\u2019s administration is looking to speed up initial screenings of immigrants seeking asylum, according to a report in Buzzfeed News. The move, immigration advocates said, would give immigrants less time to prepare for their interviews and recover from the grueling journey to the US-Mexico border. The Trump administration has taken several steps to limit the number of asylum-seekers in the US. More from Buzzfeed: Asylum officers have had to wait at least 48 hours after an immigrant has been detained for crossing into the US to interview them and hear their case. However, under a new directive implemented by US Citizenship and Immigration Services Acting Director Ken Cuccinelli, that window has been reduced to one calendar day, according to a policy change released to staffers on Monday and obtained by BuzzFeed News.\u201d It\u2019s been quite a heavy day, so here\u2019s a small dose of fun: Public Policy Polling, a Democratic polling firm, tested how Donald Trump would fare against US soccer star Megan Rapinoe in a 2020 matchup. As it turns out, Rapinoe leads Trump by 1%. According to the survey, which was conducted \u2018by popular demand\u2019, Rapinoe received 42% of the vote to Trump\u2019s 41%. As we saw with Tom Steyer, it\u2019s not too late to jump into the race. Just sayin... Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare law is once again in jeopardy, as a federal appeals court on Tuesday hears arguments on its validity. The case, which could once again place the fate of the Affordable Care Act before the supreme court, was brought by a group of Republican governors and attorneys general. The healthcare law was struck down by a federal judge in Texas in December. Three judges on the New Orleans-based 5th US circuit court of appeals will now determine if that ruling was correct. The case has significant implications for millions of Americans who have gained health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law by Obama in 2010. The supreme court upheld the core of the law, commonly referred to as \u2018Obamacare\u2019, in 2012. Republicans have nonetheless carried on with their efforts to dismantle the law. As part of Donald Trump\u2019s tax overhaul in 2017, the Republican-led Congress did away with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate -- which required most Americans to either purchase health insurance or incur a tax penalty. Republicans have argued that removing the penalty effectively did away with the legal rationale the supreme court relied upon when upholding the Affordable Care Act in 2012. The appeals court weighing the fresh challenge of the law is known as one of the most conservative appellate courts in the country, which means the case will almost certainly wind up back before the supreme court. It\u2019s been quite a day, and we\u2019re no where near done yet...! So here is a summary to help bring you up to speed on what you\u2019ve missed if you\u2019re just tuning in: Donald Trump is standing by his embattled labor secretary Alexander Acosta amid calls for the latter\u2019s resignation; Acosta has come under heightened scrutiny for striking a lenient plea deal in 2008 with financier Jeffrey Epstein, who has been charged with operating a sex trafficking ring that involved underage girls. Acosta broke his silence on the subject as Democrats called for him to step down; the labor secretary said Epstein\u2019s crimes were \u201chorrific\u201d and suggested the evidence before prosecutors today was far more expansive than the case he oversaw as Miami\u2019s top federal prosecutor in 2008. Trump is still fuming over leaked memos in which Sir Kim Darroch, the British ambassador to the US, described the president as \u201cinept\u201d and characterized his administration as \u201cdysfunctional\u201d; Trump said Darroch was \u201ca very stupid guy\u201d in a Tuesday morning tweetstorm, in which he also took aim at British prime minister Theresa May and her handling of Brexit. Two-time presidential candidate Ross Perot has died at age 89 following a five-month battle with leukemia. The Texan billionaire and philanthropist emerged as one of the most successful third-party candidates in modern US history in the 1992 presidential elections, earning nearly 19% of the popular vote. Tom Steyer formally launched his campaign for president, adding his name to the crowded field of 2020 Democratic contenders. Steyer, a billionaire environmental activist, has been a leading proponent of impeaching Trump and poured millions of dollars into the fight against climate change. A federal appeals court ruled that Trump cannot block his critics on Twitter, upholding an earlier decision which found the president in violation of the US constitution for doing so; the case was brought by seven individuals who in 2017 were blocked by Trump for tweeting critical comments at the president. Keep watching this space for more developments! 2020 presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand has released a new television ad attacking Donald Trump for failing to make good on his promises to save jobs and improve the lives of average Americans. The spot is titled \u201cI Promise\u201d and will air in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, the so-called \u201cRust Belt\u201d states that helped propel Trump to victory. Gillibrand, a senator from New York, is poised to embark on a two-day swing through those battleground states this week. Her campaign said the ad will target former Barack Obama voters who cast their ballots for Trump in 2016. It opens with footage of promises Trump made as a candidate in the last election cycle, such as improving US infrastructure, lowering prescription drug prices and restoring manufacturing jobs. But those promises were left unkept, the ad states. Gillibrand has struggled to gain traction in the crowded Democratic field. She has nonetheless continued to expand her staff in the crucial early voting states Iowa and New Hampshire. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has appeared to rule out Congress investigating or impeaching Alexander Acosta. Shortly after Donald Trump stood by his labor secretary, Pelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill: It\u2019s up to the president, it\u2019s his cabinet. We have a great deal of work to do here for the good of the American people and we have to focus on that.\u201d Here is the full transcript of what Donald Trump said of his labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, amid the controversy over the latter\u2019s 2008 plea deal with Jeffrey Epstein: I can tell you that for two and a half years he has been just an excellent secretary of labor. He\u2019s done just a fantastic job. Now part of it is our economy is so good, our unemployment numbers are at record lows. So many good things are happening. But the fact is he has been a very good secretary of labor. What happened 12 or 15 years ago with respect to when he was a US attorney, I think in Miami ... If you go back and look at everybody else\u2019s decisions, whether it\u2019s a US attorney or an assistant US attorney, or a judge, if you go back 12 or 15 years ago or 20 years ago and look at their past decisions, I would think you would probably find that they would wish they had maybe did it a different way. I do know that there were a lot of people involved in that decision, not just him. And I can only say this from what I know, and what I do know is that he has been a great -- a really great secretary of labor. The rest of it we\u2019ll have to look at, we\u2019ll have to look at it very carefully. But we\u2019re talking about a long time ago and again it was a decision made I think not by him but by a lot of people. So we\u2019re going to look at it very carefully, we\u2019ll be looking at that very carefully.\u201d Speaking of Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator does not seem particularly enthused by Tom Steyer\u2019s foray into the 2020 presidential race. Asked about the launch of Steyers campaign on Tuesday, Sanders told MSNBC: I am a bit tired of seeing billionaires trying to buy political power. So I like Tom, he\u2019s a good guy. He\u2019s a friend of mine, but I\u2019m not a great fan of billionaires getting involved in the political process.\u201d Steyer\u2019s announcement focused on removing the influence of corporate interests from US politics. Senator Bernie Sanders said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d will outline a blueprint for how he would fight the climate crisis if elected president but did not elaborate on what it would include or when it would be published. On a call with reporters about a resolution he is cosponsoring to declare a climate emergency, he said \u201cwhat is imperative to understand is it\u2019s not just the plan.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of very, very good plans out there. I think we\u2019ll have the strongest plan,\u201d Sanders said. In addition to transforming the US energy system, he said he would prioritize taking on the \u201cgreed and dishonesty of the fossil fuel industry,\u201d and would also \u201creach out to countries all over the world\u201d to tackle the global problem. Some other Democrats vying for the White House have specified how they would eliminate US carbon dioxide emissions heating the planet. Sanders has previously advocated for a carbon tax with revenues returned to taxpayers. More recently, he has endorsed the Green New Deal. Asked twice what specific measures he would pursue, Sanders did not elaborate beyond \u201cmassive\u201d investments in sustainable energy and energy efficiency and a transformation of the transportation. \u201cThe issue here is not that we cannot address this problem, I think we can. I think we know exactly what has to be done,\u201d Sanders said. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York congresswoman who is signing on to the climate emergency resolution written by Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), said she supports climate liability lawsuits against oil companies, which she called a \u201cfascinating tool.\u201d She also touted the possibility of public banks compete with fossil fuel-invested Wall Street. Donald Trump has defended his embattled labor secretary Alexander Acosta amid growing calls for his resignation. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, Trump said Acosta had done an \u2018excellent\u2019 job as labor secretary following fresh scrutiny toward Acosta\u2019s role in securing a lenient 2008 plea deal for financier Jeffrey Epstein. Trump said he felt \u201cvery badly\u201d for Acosta, while adding he would look at his role in Epstein\u2019s plea deal \u201cvery carefully\u201d. Trump also sought to distance himself from Epstein, a onetime friend he previously called a \u201cterrific guy\u201d, stating: \u201cHe was a fixture in Palm Beach, I had a falling out with him many years ago. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve spoken to him in 15 years.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments came as Acosta broke his silence on Epstein, who was charged with running a sex trafficking ring that involved underage girls. \u201cThe crimes committed by Epstein are horrific, and I am pleased that NY prosecutors are moving forward with a case based on new evidence,\u201d Acosta tweeted on Tuesday. As Miami\u2019s top federal prosecutor in 2008, Acosta struck a plea deal with Epstein that enabled the billionaire to avoid a public trial and a heavy prison sentence. Acosta sought to draw distance between the evidence available 11 years ago and that contained in the recently unsealed indictment against Epstein. \u201cWith the evidence available more than a decade ago, federal prosecutors insisted that Epstein go to jail, register as a sex offender and put the world on notice that he was a sexual predator,\u201d Acosta wrote. \u201cNow that new evidence and additional testimony is available, the NY prosecution offers an important opportunity to more fully bring him to justice.\u201d A slew of Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, have called for Acosta to step down as labor secretary amid the renewed scrutiny over his 2008 agreement with Epstein. Donald Trump cannot block his critics on Twitter, the social media platform he has used as a central form of communication, a federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday. The decision upheld a previous ruling that Trump violated the first amendment of the US constitution by blocking those who criticized the president on Twitter. In a unanimous decision by the New York-based appeals court, Judge Barrington D. Parker wrote: The First Amendment does not permit a public official who utilizes a social media account for all manner of official purposes to exclude persons from an otherwise open online dialogue because they expressed views with which the official disagrees.\u201d The case was brought by several people who had been blocked by Trump in 2017 after tweeting critical comments directed at him. The ruling is expected to set a more clear precedent for elected officials as they navigate the social media landscape that has emerged as a key means of connecting with the American public. The Justice Department argued in court that @realdonaldtrump is a personal account, as opposed to the White House\u2019s official Twitter handle. But Trump primarily uses his personal account to communicate, with the vast majority of his official statements and announcements being disseminated through his own handle. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer joined calls for labor secretary Alexander Acosta\u2019s resignation on Tuesday over his role in securing a lenient 2008 plea deal for Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire financier charged with operating a sex trafficking ring involving underage girls. \u201cIt is now impossible for anyone to have confidence in Secretary Acosta\u2019s ability to lead the department of labor. If he refuses to resign, President Trump should fire him,\u201d Schumer said in a speech on the Senate floor. Schumer was the latest prominent Democrat to push for Acosta\u2019s departure amid fresh scrunity over the \u2018sweetheart deal\u2019 he cut with Epstein while serving as Miami\u2019s top federal prosecutor more than a decade ago. In a tweet late Monday, House speaker Nancy Pelosi said Acosta \u201cmust step down\u201d, while dubbing his agreement with Epstein as \u201cunconscionable\u201d. Epstein pleaded not guilty on Monday in a New York court to one count of sex trafficking conspiracy and a second of sex trafficking underage females. Some of the victims were as young as 14, according to the unsealed indictment. My colleague Ed Pilkington has a report on the growing brigade of Democrats seeking Acosta\u2019s resignation, as well as the details of the deal he struck with Epstein that enabled the financier to avoid a public trial and heavy jail sentence: As the federal prosecutor leading the case in 2008, Acosta oversaw a plea deal in which Epstein was granted a highly unusual non-prosecution agreement that shielded him from all federal criminal charges relating to his more than 30 incidents of potential abuse of young girls. Under the deal, the FBI investigation that had already culminated in a 53-page draft indictment was shut down in favor of Epstein pleading guilty to two lesser state charges that controversially labelled his victims as prostitutes. Immunity was also granted to Epstein\u2019s \u201cpotential co-conspirators\u201d, though it did not identify individuals. Epstein ended up serving just 13 months in jail with the ability to leave the prison every day to attend his luxury business premises. 2020 presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar also called on Acosta to resign on Tuesday. \u201cSince when do underage girl sex ring traffickers get to go to their office every day while they serve their time? The victims should have had a say. That\u2019s what the law says,\u201d Klobuchar, a senator from Minnesota who opposed Acosta\u2019s nomination for labor secretary, said in a written statement. \u201cI didn\u2019t vote for former Florida U.S. Attorney Acosta to begin with and he should step down.\u201d Amy McGrath, a retired Marine fighter pilot, will run against Senate majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the 2020 election. McGrath rose to prominence in the 2018 midterms despite narrowly losing a bid for the House of Representatives. In an announcement video released on Tuesday, McGrath recalled writing a letter to McConnell as a 13-year-old girl detailing her wish to fly combat jets for the US. \u201cHe never wrote back,\u201d McGrath said. \u201cI\u2019m Amy McGrath, and I\u2019ve often wondered, how many other people did Mitch McConnell never take the time to write back or even think about?\u201d McGrath\u2019s entry into the Kentucky Senate race ended months of speculation over her plans. She was actively recruited by Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, according to reports. McConnell\u2019s campaign swiftly responded to McGrath\u2019s announcement by releasing a video casting her as too liberal for the state of Kentucky. Ross Perot, the two-time independent candidate for president, has died after a battle with leukemia, Dallas News reported. Perot was diagnosed with leukemia in February. He was 89. A family spokesperson confirmed Perot\u2019s death to the Associated Press. A self-made billionaire from Texas, Perot emerged as one of the most successful third-party candidates in modern history during the 1992 presidential election. Although he did not win any electoral college votes, Perot received nearly 19% of the popular vote -- marking the most impressive showing for an independent candidate since Theodore Roosevelt 80 years prior. Perot\u2019s second third-party run in 1996 was less successful. He was famously impersonated by Dana Carvey on Saturday Night Live during the 1990s. Following his second bid for president, Perot largely stayed out of politics. Perot is survived by his wife, Margot, and five children. Donald Trump may have disinvited Sir Kim Darroch from a dinner for the Amir of Qatar in Washington on Monday, but billionaire businessman Robert Kraft still had a seat at the table. Yes, the same Kraft who owns the New England Patriots who was charged as part of a prostitution investigation in south Florida. A photo from the dinner showed Kraft seated at Trump\u2019s table next to Christine Lagarde, the incoming president of the European Central Bank. The dinner was hosted by treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin inside the department\u2019s Cash Room in honor of Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. Trump is poised to meet with al-Thani at the White House on Tuesday. Earlier this year, Trump said he was \u201cvery surprised\u201d to see Kraft at the center of the prostitution scandal even as he defended the Patriots owner as having proclaimed his innocence. Billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer has formally launched his campaign for president, framing himself as \u201can outsider\u201d who has \u201cled grassroots efforts that have taken on big corporations and won results for people\u201d. Steyer made his bid official in an announcement video released on Tuesday, which calls for eradicating the influence of corporations on US politics. \u201cAmericans are deeply disappointed and hurt by the way they\u2019re treated by what they think is the power elite in Washington DC,\u201d Steyer said. \u201cAnd that goes across party lines and it goes across geography.\u201d Steyer is a former hedge fund investor who in recent years has been the Democratic Party\u2019s largest donor. He has spent the past year as the face of the movement to impeach Donald Trump and also poured millions of dollars into the fight against climate change. The topic of impeachment is nonetheless absent from Steyer\u2019s video, which avoids mentioning the president all together. Steyer is poised to spend $100m of his own fortune to fund his campaign. Read my full report on Steyer\u2019s 2020 launch here, in which my colleague Sam Levin and I break down the challenges he might face by entering a crowded Democratic field that has already held its first primary debates. Donald Trump has lashed out at Sir Kim Darroch as \u201ca very stupid guy\u201d in another Twitter tirade against the British ambassador to Washington that also took aim at Theresa May as \u201cfoolish\u201d. In a fresh pair of tweets on Tuesday, the president continued to react to leaked memos in which Kim described him as \u201cinept\u201d and \u201cdysfunctional\u201d. \u201cThe wacky Ambassador that the U.K. foisted upon the United States is not someone we are thrilled with, a very stupid guy,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cHe should speak to his country, and Prime Minister May, about their failed Brexit negotiation, and not be upset with my criticism of how badly it was... handled.\u201d Trump\u2019s tweets came one day after he declared he would no longer deal with Darroch and claimed the British ambassador was \u201cnot liked or well thought of within the U.S.\u201d. Darroch was also uninvited from a dinner Trump hosted for the Emir of Qatar on Monday. May has meanwhile stood by Darroch amid the controversy, even as she rejected his assessment of Trump. In a written statement, Downing Street said Darroch \u201ccontinues to have the prime minister\u2019s full support\u201d, while adding: \u201cWe have made clear to the US how unfortunate this leak is.\u201d \u201cThe selective extracts leaked do not reflect the closeness of, and the esteem in which we hold, the relationship,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAt the same time, we have also underlined the importance of Ambassadors being able to provide honest, unvarnished assessments of the politics in their country. Liam Fox, Britain\u2019s international trade secretary, was set to meet on Tuesday with Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and senior adviser, in a bid to smooth over tensions. Good morning everyone! Sabrina Siddiqui here, ready to give you the latest in Washington and beyond. Donald Trump is already tweeting and continues to have some choice words for Theresa May and British ambassador Kim Darroch (more on that in just a moment). The president is poised to welcome the Emir of Qatar at the White House today, but clearly his mind does travel... I\u2019ll also bring you the latest on the 2020 election, where the Democratic field has seen yet another entry with Tom Steyer. Because that\u2019s just what the party needs \u2013 more candidates. All eyes are on the billionaire environmental activist, who launched his campaign today. So buckle up and stay tuned for more!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
