Now prepare for a storm of rage from the cardinal's supporters", "bodyText": "This is a mighty triumph not just for George Pell who is breathing free air for the first time in a year, and his backers who invested millions in his defence, but for the narrative of prejudice the church has spun all the years since the Melbourne police came for the cardinal in Rome. The beleaguered church. The misunderstood church. The church under attack by secularists. The church pursued by abuse victims, police and journalists with axes to grind. The unanimity of the court\u2019s decision is crushing for Pell\u2019s prosecutors and, of course, for the young man who brought this complaint to the police nearly five years ago. It has been such a long process for Pell\u2019s accuser to reach this end. From the start the contest was simple: who was to be believed here, the young man who said he was raped after mass in the sacristy of St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral or the church witnesses assembled by Pell\u2019s legal team who claimed it wasn\u2019t possible. The police, the prosecution authorities in Victoria, a jury and two judges of the court of appeal in Melbourne believed the young man. They realised it was hard for Pell to have raped that boy, but it was possible. The high court has said: yes possible, but not reasonably possible. Theirs was not a decision made at a lofty level of theory. As has been its practice lately, the high court dug right down into the evidence. The unanimous judgment delivered this morning involves more than a hundred paragraphs of meticulous reconstruction of the rituals of the cathedral, of doors opened and closed, of robes and processions. The judges do not accuse the young man of being a liar or a fantasist. They do not find his evidence contained discrepancies or displayed inadequacies \u201cof such a character as to require the jury to have entertained a doubt as to guilt\u201d. But they have done what the jury and the Victorian court of appeal did not do: they have trusted absolutely the evidence of Pell\u2019s master of ceremonies Monsignor Charles Portelli. This church official said he was with the archbishop at all times that morning, first on the steps of the cathedral farewelling the faithful and then in the sacristy helping him unrobe. The high court observed that Portelli\u2019s evidence of having an actual recall of being with Pell on the steps was never challenged by the prosecution. Believe Portelli here and it is hard to believe the man who accuses Pell of rape. The court did what the prosecution argued all the way should not be done: it compounded all the improbabilities to establish doubt. Rather than adding they multiplied the improbabilities. So the judges concluded that even though they found the young man\u2019s accusations \u201ccredible and reliable\u201d the jury \u201cacting rationally\u201d should have \u201centertained a doubt\u201d as to Pell\u2019s guilt and not put those doubts aside. \u201cPlainly they did. Making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility in relation to [the sacristy charges] that an innocent person has been convicted.\u201d Tolling through their honours\u2019 judgement is the word \u201cunchallenged\u201d. Pell\u2019s acquittal relies almost entirely on the failure of the prosecution to challenge \u2013 let alone destroy \u2013 the evidence of the old cathedral officials and former choir boys in the witness box. The prosecution found gaps but never tore down the fence protecting Pell. Long term, the court\u2019s decision reinforces scepticism in senior legal circles about prosecution of accusations of sex crimes committed a long time ago. The question that has yet to be fully explored is how the law operates here when time has placed everyone \u2013 the accused, accusers, police and prosecutors \u2013 at such a disadvantage. Pell is innocent of these charges. By the ultimate authority we recognise in this country, he was wrongly imprisoned. He has issued a statement offering Christian forgiveness to his tormentors. He can leave it now to his supporters to rage on his behalf. It is going to be a mighty storm. Category Five. What will be very interesting to watch is whether Rome joins the celebrations. Further work awaits Pell\u2019s lawyers and further bills for his supporters to pay. Victims\u2019 lawyers claim eight civil suits at least are under way to make the church pay for Pell\u2019s alleged failures to protect them from paedophiles. And as early as today, we will discover, at last, the royal commission\u2019s verdict on the career that took a Ballarat priest who noticed so little about these crimes on his home turf all the way to the highest echelons of the Vatican."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
