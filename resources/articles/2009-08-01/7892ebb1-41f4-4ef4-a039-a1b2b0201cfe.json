As yet, there is no sign to alert passersby that Canford Cliffs is doing his own exercises on the other side of the hill but in view of the horse's reputation and the galloping expectations around him, one may soon be justified. As recently as mid-May, before his racecourse debut, Canford Cliffs' name had got no further than the local pubs, where he was apparently the subject of excited chatter among stable staff. Then he hacked up by seven lengths at Newbury and won the Coventry Stakes by almost as far at Royal Ascot and suddenly Hannon's secret weapon was as much in plain sight as a Challenger tank crossing the road. Nor is there any disguising his target. Canford Cliffs is supposed to give Hannon his first British Classic for 20 years in the 2,000 Guineas and although that race is almost nine months off, he is no bigger than 5-1. Those odds have tightened up in the two months since Ascot, while the horse has been kept \"ticking over\" at home thanks to the fact that the runner-up, Xtension, has boosted the form by winning Goodwood's Vintage Stakes. Even the 5-1 may be a distant memory after Canford Cliffs reappears in the Prix Morny at Deauville a week on Sunday. Despite his recent lack of success in it, the Guineas has been hugely important for Hannon. Having taken control of just a dozen horses from his father in 1970, he pulled off a 50-1 shock in the Newmarket race three years later, with Mon Fils. The trainer's website claims that he had \u00a350 each-way at 200-1, setting him up in his new career. A brace of Guineas with Don't Forget Me in 1987 and Tirol in 1990 put him in a position to buy a second yard, which is now his main base, and expand his string to the present 180 horses. Since then he has sent out more than 100 winners in 17 of the last 18 years. Hannon denies frustration at the fact that he has not repeated the Classic victories which brought him so much. \"We've won plenty of races,\" he says, \"but you only get one shot at a Guineas. We've been placed several times, we just haven't won them. We've had horses we thought were going to go on and didn't. They weren't quite good enough and that's it.\" And there is the nub of the matter. At the moment, Canford Cliffs is just an extreme example of the kind of fast, precocious two-year-old with which Hannon is now firmly associated. Will the colt's contemporaries have caught up by next spring, or will he make the continued improvement necessary to become a Classic winner? Hannon plans to give him every chance. The horse was almost certainly bought with the aim of running in the valuable sales races in which his trainer has such a good record, and he is still entered in a couple of those. But he is likely to miss the tempting sums on offer in favour of a more traditional Guineas preparation. \"We've just gotta let him mature a little bit now,\" says Hannon, who intends to give him two more races this year, starting with the Morny. How does Canford Cliffs compare with Don't Forget Me and Tirol? Hannon, who has been gruff and defensive, as if feeling the pressure that comes with a good horse, breaks into a broad grin. \"He's the same ilk, isn't he? In fact, he's probably better than them.\" Hannon's son, also Richard, who will take over the licence in due course, is even more enthused about the stable's star and praises the horse's laid-back nature, which is at odds with the hard-pulling tearaway we saw at Ascot. \"He's very relaxed at home, you'd have a job to get him to do anything. He's perfect, he's never dropped anyone yet, he's as good as gold. He's enjoying himself now.\" Also enjoying himself is Jimmy Derham, a budding jump jockey who passes the summer months by riding out for the Hannons. Allotted Canford Cliffs at random in the spring, he now finds himself regularly aboard one of the fastest horses in the country. \"He's different class,\" says Derham. \"You know you're sitting on something special when you're riding him. Everything's just so easy and so natural. When you're going out to the gallops, he's just chilled out, he loves it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
