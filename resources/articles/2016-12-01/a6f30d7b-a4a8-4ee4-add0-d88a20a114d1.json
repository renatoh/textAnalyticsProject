Aitor Karanka\u2019s Brazilian left-back had two friends on the doomed flight carrying the players of Chapecoense which ran out of fuel and crashed just outside Medell\u00edn on its way to the Copa Sudamericana final in Colombia last week. \u201cI played with them both in Brazil when we were young,\u201d says Da Silva. \u201cOne of my friends was the centre-back Marcelo and the other was the full-back Alan Ruschel, who was one of those who survived. He was on TV this week talking about it. To see and hear him was so emotional. It\u2019s very hard to talk about it. I played with those two guys when we were 13 or 14 at Fluminense.\u201d It made the realisation of the tragedy\u2019s full extent all the more painful. \u201cI discovered the news that terrible day when I woke up,\u201d said the former Manchester United and Cardiff City player, who will again deputise for the injured George Friend at Southampton. \u201cAt first, I just heard there were problems with the Chapecoense flight. At first you did not think it was that big a deal because there was no mention of anything serious. But then later I picked up my phone and there were so many messages. That\u2019s when I realised the terrible news. I just started crying. \u201cA lot of those guys who died were just like me. You see yourself in them. It could happen to any one of us really. Brazil\u2019s such a big country, you have to fly everywhere. You could imagine yourself in that position.\u201d Before Middlesbrough\u2019s 1-0 home victory against Hull City on Monday night a minute\u2019s silence was immaculately observed at the Riverside. \u201cThat silence was very hard for me, it brought it all home,\u201d Da Silva says. \u201cChapecoense was not a big club but an emerging club, a growing club. All the boys there had never really had big contracts before. But because of their recent success they were starting to be rewarded. Those big contracts were life-changing for them. Not just them but for their families too. That almost makes it even worse.\u201d The awful news prompted extra phone calls between Da Silva and his identical twin and former Old Trafford team-mate, Rafael, now at Lyon. \u201cRafael\u2019s coming here for Christmas because of the winter break in France and our parents are flying over from Brazil,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll bring Rafael along to training and have some fun \u2013 he can train instead of me. If I fancy a rest on Boxing Day, I\u2019ll get him to play as me. \u201cAt Manchester United the only way Sir Alex Ferguson could tell us apart was because I wore a wedding ring. But Rafael\u2019s married now too and we both wear them. We also both have a scar in exactly the same place on our foreheads.\u201d Until fairly recently the twins were virtually inseparable. \u201cAt 11 we left home to follow our football careers, moving a long way from our family, but I played with Rafael all the way through,\u201d says Fabio. \u201cFor all my life we shared a home, living together wherever we were until we left Manchester United. \u201cThat was the first time we\u2019d been apart. It was quite hard for us because we are so close. We were both scouted by United at the same time at Fluminense. He played on the right and I was left-back. Luckily, Sir Alex liked both of us.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
