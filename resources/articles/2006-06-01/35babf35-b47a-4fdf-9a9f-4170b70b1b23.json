Costa, an Italian-style coffee chain owned by the British leisure group Whitbread, said yesterday that it planned to launch in Shanghai and elsewhere in eastern China. The first bar should open in early 2007. Christopher Rogers, Whitbread's group finance director, said China was an attractive market for Costa, which has agreed a joint venture with its Chinese partner, Yueda Group. \"This is a huge market. There is an evolving middle class out there. We think it is one that we need to exploit and investigate,\" he said. Costa announced plans to expand across tea-drinking India last year, and already trades in 14 countries. Its latest plan follows other large European and US brands keen to tap into mounting consumer buying power in China as its export-led growth powers ahead. Starbucks moved into China in 1999 and has hundreds of coffee bars across the country. With China's average daily wage at less than \u00a33, not much above the cost of a brew from Costa in the UK, the middle class sees foreign coffee brands as a status symbol. Asked about affordability, Mr Rogers said: \"Do we know exactly what price a cup of coffee will be at this stage? No.\" In a trading statement, Whitbread said like-for-like sales at Costa, which has more than 450 bars in Britain, were up 6.5% on a year ago in the 13 weeks to June. For the group as a whole, which includes Premier Travel Inns and David Lloyd Leisure health clubs, like-for-like sales were up 1.6% and total sales rose almost 7%. Whitbread shares closed up 1.82% at \u00a311.17."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
