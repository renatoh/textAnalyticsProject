For that alone, Sandi Toksvig's Christmas Cracker is worth a tug. Its second half includes 10 winning minutes of solo Corbett; comedy's pocket dynamo also stumbles through Christmases past, present and future in a shambolic Dickens retread. But Little Ron's contribution is one among too many. Talk about shaggy dogs: this show has the coiffeur of a particularly hirsute Afghan hound. It needs a trim and a tidy. It's essentially an evening of variety. West End chanteuse Maria Friedman sings Winter Wonderland. Five Guys Named Moe strut their harmonising stuff with a precision absent elsewhere; conductor Charles Hazlewood marshals the audience in a \"ding-dong\" sing-song. Between acts, a backstage story unfolds in which Toksvig's stage manager falls for a fairy, who in turn falls foul of some black magic. As the mouthy fairy, Petra Massey of the theatre company Spymonkey steals the show, embodying demonic possession with gleefully un-Christmassy malevolence. But all this wing-and-a-prayer dottiness frays the patience in act two, as Toksvig manhandles a guest-star through the Scrooge role in A Christmas Carol. With its irreverent gags and compromised celebs (on press night: Green Wing's Stephen Mangan), it wants to be a Morecambe and Wise-style spoof. But it's slapdash and barely funny enough to excuse the ruination wreaked on a great story. (Children may be nonplussed.) Corbett duly comes to the rescue, a fireside joke-teller with a star of Bethlehem-sized twinkle in his eye, and the show's uncynical good cheer just about propels it into its fourth hour. But \u2013 as Toksvig and Corbett shouldn't need telling \u2013 smaller might have been more beautiful."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
