Or, as singer-songwriter and Wolverhampton native Tom Aspaul puts it: \u201cYou associate it with coal, steel, and metal bands, not flares, sequins and Studio 54.\u201d That has not stopped him from channelling his homeland\u2019s heritage on his forthcoming album, Black Country Disco, a pop project that\u2019s being drip-fed via monthly singles, with December\u2019s being a cover of Everyday, a song by Wolverhampton\u2019s very own Slade. In fact, the region\u2019s rock heritage runs through the heart of the album, not least in its visual identity, which pays tribute to the logos of some of the area\u2019s more hirsute bands (think: ELO and Black Sabbath), all jagged, blood red metallic lettering. Musically, the album playfully incorporates the genres of its title, but forges a more symbolic link back to the Black Country via a rush of nostalgia. It was brought on by moving back home from London following the end of a five-year relationship. \u201cSonically, I listened to a whole raft of disco from the mid 70s to the mid 80s; music I\u2019d imagine my mom dancing to at the Lafayette club in Wolverhampton when she was young,\u201d he explains. While rock and rap revel in civic pride, with artists from Arctic Monkeys to Slowthai repping their postcodes, big pop \u2013 especially now in its more globalised state \u2013 favours generalised subjects delivered with non-specific blankness. Aspaul, who has worked with the likes of Kylie Minogue, MNEK and, well, Louise Redknapp, says he has felt that pressure to soften his identity. \u201cComing from Wolverhampton has shaped who I am and how I understand the world,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019d always felt a sense of \u2018imposter syndrome\u2019, glossing over where I was from to make life smoother.\u201d Black Country Disco is not just about correcting that via accents or nods to local landmarks (one song, WM, is about long hours spent on the stretch of the M6 that pierces through Wolverhampton), it is also about something more ephemeral. \u201c[The album] is melancholic and wistful \u2013 like the bleak landscapes here,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s got a good heart and knows how to have a good time, just like Black Country folk!\u201d Aside from Katy Perry\u2019s California Gurls and more recently AJ Tracey\u2019s Ladbroke Grove, there haven\u2019t been many hits shouting out an artist\u2019s home patch of late. Aspaul is keen to change that. And, anything he can do to improve Wolverhampton\u2019s pop credentials the better: \u201cLegendary Beverley Knight aside, we can\u2019t have everyone thinking Liam Payne is the best we have to offer.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
