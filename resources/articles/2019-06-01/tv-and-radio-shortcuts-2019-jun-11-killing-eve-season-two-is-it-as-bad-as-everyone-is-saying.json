Taking over writing duties from Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge is Emerald Fennell (Waller-Bridge has taken an executive producer role). Not everyone thinks Fennell is up to the job: the response after Sunday\u2019s premiere was muted, with some fans claiming that Killing Eve lacks its former magic. Giles Coren \u2013 a man not shy in coming forward with gossamer-thin opinions \u2013 agreed: \u201cThought it was bilge ... dour, wooden, predictable shite,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. Is this fair? Not really. The first episode picks up minutes after season one\u2019s cliffhanger and a bleeding Villanelle is on the loose again. The cat-and-mouse dynamic that gripped viewers throughout Killing Eve\u2019s first run is restored instantly: Polastri is once again searching for the psychopathic assassin on whom she is erotically fixated. The idea that the series has lost its original sparkle is unjustified. A scene in which a panicked Polastri devours an enormous bag of sweets is firmly in the Waller-Bridge wheelhouse \u2013 and reminds me of the season two Fleabag episode where Claire cuts her hair. (Which woman hasn\u2019t stress-eaten, or had a disastrous haircut, during periods of emotional upheaval?) Sure, the episode isn\u2019t perfect: a skit in which Villanelle escapes from hospital in a pair of pyjamas feels reverse-engineered to be shared on social media, but, even then, Comer \u2013 a superb physical performer \u2013 nails it. A scene where Villanelle pours alcohol on her stab wound had me wincing. If the criticism of Killing Eve feels unfair, it\u2019s understandable \u2013 Waller-Bridge is the woman of the moment, fresh from a triumphant Broadway run and recently tapped to overhaul the crisis-ridden Bond 25. Taking over from her is an unenviable job. But for now, Killing Eve remains as bouncy and fabulous as Oh\u2019s lustrous curls. Whether it will fall flat in coming episodes remains to be seen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
