These proposals have been precipitated by an increase in EU members from 15 in 2004 to 27 today. These enlargements have been successful, bringing in 10 former communist countries of eastern Europe to the EU fold. Any large business or other organisation which almost doubled its membership in such a short space of time would have to alter its rules and modus operandi. There is no doubt that if the EU didn't address the impact of new members on its institutions, it would be severely criticised. The draft treaty is in Britain's interests as well as the EU's because it will lead to more efficient, effective and democratic decision-making. Ratification of the treaty by all 27 EU states will help the union to focus on the issues that really matter, including a deeper single market and climate change. It is this agenda, rather than excessive debate about institutional reform, that should occupy the EU's energies in the years ahead.

There is a third alternative: a free vote of MPs. This would allow all MPs to study the treaty and to determine for themselves whether it represents an improvement on the current situation.
