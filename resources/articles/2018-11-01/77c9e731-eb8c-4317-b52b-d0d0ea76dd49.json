Eddie Jones said this week he pays so little attention when the haka is taking place \u201cthey could be playing the Spice Girls and I wouldn\u2019t know\u201d. But it has become a tradition for Twickenham goers to greet the customary Maori challenge with a loud chorus of England\u2019s long-serving anthem. Doing so has split opinion with the former New Zealand centre Ma\u2019a Nonu previously accusing England fans of \u201cdisrespect\u201d while their ex-head coach Graham Henry has described it as \u201cnot the right thing to do\u201d. World Rugby has advised opposing teams to respect the haka but that has not stopped some from adopting novel responses. Wales stood their ground in 2008, France formed a V-shape and advanced towards New Zealand in the 2011 World Cup final (for which they were fined \u00a32,500) and Richard Cockerill confronted Norm Hewitt in 1997. Owen Farrell on Friday moved to play down the relevance of facing the haka but his co-captain Dylan Hartley said: \u201cVocal is good. Be vocal at the weekend. The haka is great, Swing Low is great, everyone gets excited about both things. It creates a great atmosphere.\u201d The England outside-centre, Henry Slade, added: \u201cLast time the All Blacks played here the crowd were singing at the same time as the haka and that will probably create an unbelievable atmosphere and environment.\u201d The All Blacks captain, Kieran Read, insisted his side would not be fazed by any responses however, either from England\u2019s players or supporters. \u201cWe do the haka as a challenge but it is more about us connecting as a team. The opposition can do what they like,\u201d he said. \u201cI certainly get a kick out of it and I\u2019m sure the crowd does as well. Whether they sing or not, it adds to the atmosphere. For me it\u2019s a great part of the game.\u201d Farrell has insisted he will not push the legal boundaries against the All Blacks after his controversial tackle on Andr\u00e9 Esterhuizen in the dying moments of England\u2019s one-point win over South Africa sparked great debate. While no action was given at the time World Rugby on Thursday issued a statement reiterating its crackdown on \u201cno-arms tackles and high tackles\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to play to the edge of the rules,\u201d said Farrell. \u201cI\u2019m definitely not trying to do that, especially not when the clock has gone red in a Test match. Some people will and won\u2019t understand when a collision is big how difficult it is. \u201cBut that\u2019s the rules and I\u2019m well aware of them. I don\u2019t want to play on the edge, I want to play within them. It\u2019s done and it definitely won\u2019t be in my head going into this weekend.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
