It's whimsical and at times meandering, but has enough to it that it doesn't fall into that most pointless of categories: twee. Songs about matrimony (Marry Me, Archie), defiant lovers (Party Police) and rejection (The Agency Group) are all covered with Molly Rankin's drawling vocal, cloaking everything in a layer of longing and reflection. It's earnest and intelligent, but with only nine songs it feels more like an elongated EP than a fully realised LP. They certainly have their sound down (reverb-laced guitars, big choruses, surf-tinged moments), but there's a lack of variety here. Still, there are some genuinely great moments, including album closer Red Planet, on which the band move away from indie-rock and show they can splice synths with sadness."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
