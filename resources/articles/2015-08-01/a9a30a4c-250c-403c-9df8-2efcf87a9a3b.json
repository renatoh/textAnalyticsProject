For 22 years he served Bournemouth as player, coach and manager, a job that involved buying training kit from the market and organising a team photo on a yacht in an effort to keep the club financially afloat. They are part of the reason Liverpool\u2019s new assistant manager \u201cviews this Premier League bubble through a different lens\u201d. O\u2019Driscoll was the surprise appointment as Brendan Rodgers\u2019 No2 this summer when the Liverpool manager parted company with long-time assistant Colin Pascoe and the first-team coach Mike Marsh. Poached from the Football Association, where he had worked as the England Under-19s coach, the 58-year-old is tasked with taking Liverpool \u201cin a new technical direction\u201d with Rodgers. He brings a refreshing honesty and engaging presence to the role after a career outside the precious, rarefied air of the Premier League. It is an outlook forged on the south coast. \u201cYou name it, I have done it at Bournemouth,\u201d says O\u2019Driscoll before his own league bow at Anfield on Monday evening. \u201cIt was fantastic when they got promoted and there are lots of people still there I know \u2013 players and staff \u2013 so I sent them texts the night they came up reminding them about how it used to be. Someone texted me back with \u2018Remember Fruit of the Loom?\u2019 We had no training kit, so we went to the market and bought a load of Fruit of the Loom T-shirts. Oh my God. I was manager then. Part of the kit deal was that you got \u00a320,000 worth of training kit but you were being charged a lot for a cotton top. We were looking to save or maximise money, so we decided not to take the money from the kit deal for the training kit and went to the market instead.\u201d Bournemouth had become Europe\u2019s first community club by the time O\u2019Driscoll became manager in 2000; he had previously made a then record 423 league appearances for the Cherries. Board meetings were not so much romantic as supporters strived to keep their club alive, he recalls, as \u201ca noose around the neck over time because you could never get on. Every man and his dog was in there and there were always factions.\u201d The manager took it upon himself to raise funds. O\u2019Driscoll explains: \u201cRather than go into the boardroom and ask for money we tended to do our own thing to raise money. We wanted to make sure we had balls throughout the season, so we did our own team photoshoot. We asked the yacht people, Sunseeker, for help and all got on one of their boats at Poole Harbour, turned it around to face Bournemouth pier, sat everyone down and got a local photographer to take the team shot from a rowing boat. We printed it as our team photo and sold it. The club wasn\u2019t too happy when we outsold the official photograph but we weren\u2019t raising money for a party. It was all for the club\u2019s benefit.\u201d The former Fulham and Republic of Ireland midfielder admits he has always been challenging of authority. \u201cI was late coming into football, 21 or 22,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t come into it with any ideas of what it was meant to be. My perceptions were different and have been the same ever since. I wasn\u2019t trying to be arsey but I was always asking why we were doing certain things.\u201d It is that approach, coupled with his work at Doncaster Rovers \u2013 the first team Rodgers faced as Watford manager at Vicarage Road \u2013 and more challenging spells at Bristol City and Nottingham Forest, that O\u2019Driscoll suspects led to the call from the Liverpool manager\u2019s office this summer. \u201cI had a message to ring Brendan and I thought it was because he wanted to know how Sheyi Ojo had done with England\u2019s Under-18s,\u201d he admits. \u201cI\u2019d also spoken to Brendan and numerous other managers about Joe Gomez \u2013 Liverpool\u2019s \u00a33.5m summer signing from Charlton Athletic \u2013 because people had asked me. At the time I was surprised that no Premier League club had come in for him.\u201d O\u2019Driscoll claims Rodgers \u201cwants me to challenge and say what I think about doing things and how we can maximise the talents we have, although you have to be careful how you do it. You have to show respect.\u201d He also believes it is not only Liverpool who needed the overhaul their manager prescribed with his backroom changes this summer. \u201cYou could say that about the whole of the Premier League,\u201d insists O\u2019Driscoll on the desire for a shakeup. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bubble. It\u2019s almost like the outside world doesn\u2019t exist. Inside, it\u2019s awash with money in certain aspects and there are a lot of things you can do which you can\u2019t do elsewhere. \u201cYou attract arguably not some of the best characters but some of the best players in the world. It\u2019s about managing that and trying to get people to understand. They are all talented individuals \u2013 if they weren\u2019t they wouldn\u2019t be here \u2013 but the danger is they will always do what they have always done. Why would they change? \u201cThey are talented in this bubble, which means they get paid an awful lot of money, although that shouldn\u2019t be thrown at them. With the young English players I\u2019ve worked with, if someone does something poorly on a football pitch the first thing that\u2019s thrown at them is they get paid too much money. Why is that the first thing thrown at a lad? I don\u2019t understand it. \u201cYou want players to think about what they do and to look at things a bit differently but often they think \u2018I\u2019m successful and get paid a lot of money \u2013 why would I change?\u2019 When I walked in, I had a completely fresh view of things. I\u2019d never worked at this level before. I had a preconception of what it was like in the Premier League but walking into it, it\u2019s completely different. You do things and people will react and play the way they play. I\u2019m trying to get them to look at why they do it. \u201cI had a job at the FA that I really believed in and when the offer from Brendan came I spent two weeks trying to find someone to convince me not to do it. I could not find anyone.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
