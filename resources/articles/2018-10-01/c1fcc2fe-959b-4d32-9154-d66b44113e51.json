Paul Pogba scored on the rebound following Jordan Pickford\u2019s save. Idrissa Gueye appeared to touch the ball before Martial made contact with his leg. Everton\u2019s manager said: \u201cIt was not a penalty \u2013 it is clear the player dived, it leaves a bad sensation. I told the players at half-time it was not a fair result. When the game is balanced in the first 20-25 minutes, the penalty starts to put them ahead in the match and more comfortable. \u201cThat moment, it was no penalty. It was difficult for us. That moment makes it easy for our opponents. You are more exposed then because you have to take more risks. They scored a fantastic goal but we had a good chance to score at 2-1.\u201d Gylfi Sigurdsson scored Everton\u2019s goal from the spot after Richarlison was felled by Chris Smalling. \u201cOur one was a clear penalty, not like the first one,\u201d Silva said. \u201cThe referee is there in that moment and it looks like my player touched the ball. I don\u2019t think it is a tough decision. I don\u2019t want to talk about it more because I respect the referee. One thing is clear is that without that moment, it would have been more tough for them. When you play against Manchester United, and in their stadium, they create chances. The referee made things easier for them, but we have to shoot better in some situations.\u201d Jos\u00e9 Mourinho said: \u201cI think the referee was very good in all the game. He was solid and consistent. In the two penalty actions he was consistent.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
