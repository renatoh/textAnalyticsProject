I've played in much worse atmospheres", "bodyText": "The Trent Bridge Test has come under a lot of scrutiny in the past few days, but what is it that has sparked most debate after a fantastic game of cricket? That's right, a few jelly beans. We're a bit bemused by the reaction because, however hard people try to look for a sinister explanation for the fact that a couple of sweets were left by the stumps, it's actually pretty bland. We had been in the field so long by Sunday evening that we were just trying to keep spirits up. Nothing personal was intended for Zaheer Khan, but we can all see that this hasn't been good for the team and we need to make sure it doesn't happen again. The odd thing is I have seen stuff such as this go on hundreds of times in county cricket. Someone might leave a sweet wrapper on a good length, but the batsman just tends to kick it away. It's happened on plenty of occasions before. It's just that it's never been brought up or magnified in this way. I should also add that nothing was thrown in Zaheer's direction, as has been suggested. It's a shame, because the whole episode has detracted from what was a cracking game of cricket. People have wondered whether there were too many verbals flying around but, just because there's a lot of talk, that doesn't mean it's sledging. We're very aware of the spirit of the game and its traditions. Chatter is just a way of keeping the energy going in the team. It's important to help the bowlers, especially if Monty's on and there are men round the bat. We're always working at ways to turn ourselves into the No1 side in the world and we're looking at the tiny percentages where we can be better. Peter Moores is trying to give us an edge, but not in the overly aggressive way that some people seem to think. I've written before about hunting as a pack in the field, and that's all it is: short leg, silly point and the keeper all help out. Australia did it so well with Shane Warne - they knew how to make a batsman feel uncomfortable, and Kumar Sangakkara's very good at it for Sri Lanka when Murali's bowling. That just goes to show that even the best spinners in the world need the support of their team-mates, and Matt Prior does it really well for us. He's not saying anything serious, just trying to create pressure. The stump mics pick up a lot more than they did 10 years ago, but have they really picked up anything from this England team that has been genuinely offensive? It might surprise a few of you to know that the second Test was actually far from being the toughest game I've played in from a verbal point of view. In fact it was nowhere near, and I was called a few things by the Australians over the winter. Teams all round the world play hard now, and the young Indian bowlers are no different. Having said that, we were a bit shocked by Sreesanth, because that beamer he bowled to Kevin Pietersen was right on the money. It's not a great thing to see when you're one of the batsmen waiting to go in, as I was. Then there was that huge no-ball when he went round the wicket to Paul Collingwood. It's always hard to say whether something like that was deliberate, but you'd have thought it would be difficult to run through the crease by that much. The sad thing about all the incidental stuff is that we're in danger of forgetting about the cricket. I wrote after Lord's about how that was some of the best bowling I had seen from an England side since the 2005 Ashes, and I came away from Nottingham thinking pretty well the same. The amount of times we beat the bat without getting an edge was exceptional. I think Vaughany said 8% of all our deliveries produced a play-and-miss, and that spell from Ryan Sidebottom to Sachin Tendulkar on the third morning was pure class. If he can repeat that at The Oval next week, we'll have every chance of squaring the series."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
