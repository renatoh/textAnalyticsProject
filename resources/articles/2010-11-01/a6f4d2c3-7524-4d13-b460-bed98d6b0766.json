Why Elton John Night? Well, Simon Cowell keeps saying that he's determined to find a cutting-edge new generation of pop star, so it makes perfect sense for everyone to sing a load of 35-year-old songs about bricks written by a myopic 63-year-old pianist in an unconvincing wig, doesn't it? Vive la Revoluci\u00f3n! Still, X Factor needs to come back hard after losing so much public confidence last week. And now that (most of) the (admittedly still quite chaffy) wheat has been separated from the chaff, this could be one of the most closely-fought contests of the year. Will Mary pull herself together? Will Paije attempt to curry favour with Louis Walsh by getting married to Dawn French at the end of his song? Will Katie decide which of her personalities is the real one before she starts singing? I'm already on the edge of my seat. Things get going at 8pm - in the meantime, hop down to the comment section and say hello. Seriously, I'll get lonely if you don't. 8.01pm: IT'S TIME! TO FACE! NINETY MINUTES OF UNDERWHELMING 1970s PIANO BALLADS! 8.04pm: Oh, that's a shame. I was sort of hoping that Dermot would be wearing a silly wig in tribute to tonight's theme. What an almighty letdown this evening already is. 8.06pm: Paije is first on. Apparenty he went to the Harry Potter premiere this week. I suspect this will be the last any of us will hear of this tonight. But anyway, last week was a turning point for Paije. It was when he transformed from a wheezing nonentity to someone who at least looks like he's capable of convincingly expressing basic human emotion. Which puts him a step above Katie, obviously. But can this late flourish save him? 8.08pm: Wow, OK, maybe not. Paije is doing Crocodile Rock tonight, possibly one of the worst songs ever written. Dannii Minogue must really hate him - first she kept dressing him up like Max Headroom for a laugh, and now she's making him sing genuinely horrible songs from the top of massive plastic wedding cakes in a ridiculously unflattering salmon-coloured tuxedo. I hope Paije stays in for a few weeks now, just to see if Dannii will keep tormenting him. Hopefully she'll dress him up as a little Dutch girl next week, and make him sing Touch My Bum by The Cheeky Girls. 8.10pm: Paije has earnt a Luther Vandross comparison from Louis Walsh this week. Let's keep him in, everyone, if only to see if Louis can think of a third black person to compare him to next Saturday. My money's on either Shaft or Grace Jones, for what it's worth. 8.14pm: Also, did Louis berate Dannii for picking an Elton John song that was released before Paije was born? Hopefully he doesn't want everyone to sing recent Elton John songs. That would literally be the worst possible thing that could happen tonight, and I include fires and collapsing walls in that assessment. 8.18pm: And now for cartoon vampire Aiden Grimshaw. He also went to the Harry Potter premiere this week. I did not anticipate this. Last week Aiden managed to turn Nothing Compares 2 U into a legitimately creepy stalker's anthem, so I don't care what he sings tonight. He could do Crocodile Rock again and I'd still end up curled into a ball and crying into my clenched fists. He can sing whatever he likes, so long as it's over soon. 8.20pm: Yikes. Aiden is singing Rocket Man the way he sings all his songs, like someone who would only build a rocket if it was an exact replica of your face, so that he could lick it and then send it into space while he takes his clothes off and mirthlessly dances around his garden. Yes, yes, you ARE a rocket man, Aiden. Whatever you say. Just, please, don't use any more of my blood to paint that picture of the devil on your cellar wall. 8.24pm: Singing third is Mary, who went to see a film this week. I forget which one. After last week's dismal effort, this is really a make or break night for her. She wants to modernise her style, but trying makes her grumpy. Still, if she ends up in tomorrow's sing-off, maybe she'll sing Please Scan Your First Item (Into My Heart), a song that I've just written for her. On the back of a gas bill. In crayon. 8.27pm: Mary has chosen Can You Feel The Love Tonight from The Lion King. If I remember correctly, this is the song that accompanies the sex scene between Simba and Nala. Maybe this is why she's really giving it her all tonight - because her mind is full of mental images, either real or imagined, of Wagner standing over her in just his pants with a wicked glint in his eye. Everyone would sing as hard as possible if they were thinking about that, wouldn't they? Anything to get rid of it. Still, at least we know what singing something 'Mary Byrne style' means now. It means screaming it like a trapped mountain goat. 8.30pm: Simon has called Mary \"a bit pub-singerish\" but is letting her off because \"she's got a heart\". Not like all those other pub singers who don't have biological organs to pump blood around their bodies. They're all crap. 8.31pm: Ah, THIS is why it's Elton John night. It's because Your Song is the music that accompanies the new John Lewis advert. Incidentally, next week's theme is I Feel Like Chicken Tonight. These two facts are not unrelated. 8.34pm: And now for Katie, who has this week been mostly enduring horrific Flatliners-style nightmares about Poor Traik as well as Gamu. Poor Traik. She'll probably have to face a firing squad when she returns to Tamworth now, and it's all Katie's fault. You hear that, Katie? It's all your fault. 8.36pm: Oh, this is a shame. It was reported that Katie was going to be doing The Bitch Is Back, which would have been perfect because a) she is a bitch and b) anatomically, she has a back. But instead she's doing a ridiculously patchy version of Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting. Which, to be fair, it is. Saturday night IS alright for fighting. And, if you're Katie, Sunday night is alright for begging for your life in the midst of a harrowing emotional meltdown. If only Elton called his song that instead. Stupid Elton. 8.39pm: God, that was awful. It was like what you'd see if Elton John wanted to stage a We Will Rock You-style West End musical, but scrimped by only hiring idiots and farmyard animals to stage and dress and perform it. Nice boots, though. 8.41pm: Katie's pleading for her life by invoking the sad children she saw at the Pride Of Britain awards this week. Katie, they were sad because they don't like you. 8.42pm: Internet Dreamboy Matt Cardle's turn now. Which Elton John song will he attempt? Given his inclination to only sing girl's songs, the smart money's on Don't Go Breaking My Heart. But only Kiki Dee's part of Don't Go Breaking My Heart. He'll spend Elton John's bits just sort of standing around silently and puffing his cheeks out. Just you watch. 8.44pm: Ah, I was wrong. Instead of following my brilliant advice, Matt's doing Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. In retrospect that was sort of inevitable, because it's got a high-pitched bit in it that sounds like a fruitbat being castrated with a wooden meat hammer. Honestly, it's hard to know if Matt is singing this or just trying to locate the nearest shoal of krill with sonar. However, at least he's been given a dance routine this week. Obviously, by 'given a dance routine' I mean 'asked to briefly show off the lining of his jacket'. Same thing really. 8.45pm: He was quite good, by the way. I forgot to mention that. I mean, obviously he's no Wagner... 8.52pm: And now for Cher Lloyd. After last week, when she did a Jay-Z song and Simon Cowell called her boring, Cher finds herself in a bit of a quandary. Should she do a song with a rap in the middle and run the risk of another slating, or should she just do a ballad and ignore her true calling of only doing songs that have a rap in the middle? Oh, lord, let there be a rap in the middle. Oh, Cher went to see the Harry Potter film this week too, in case you're keeping count. 8.55pm: Well, I was half right. Cher - top half Dallas, bottom half Tron - is doing Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word, which was covered by Blue, who did All Rise, which had a rap in the middle. But who knows? Sorry might actually be the hardest word for Cher. It certainly isn't the easiest. The easiest word for Cher is Ringydingydingy. Maybe she should have performed Ringydingydingy Seems To Be The Easiest Word instead. I'd have bought it. Oh wait, this has got a rap in the middle. It's a rap from an Eminem song. This is appropriate either because Elton John once sang one song with Eminem at the Grammys once or because, like Elton John, Eminem once wrote and performed the soundtrack to a Disney film about an easygoing cartoon warthog. Who can say for sure? 8.59pm: Wagner now, who went to the Harry Potter premiere but presumably got kicked out early for being a deatheater. Between you and me, I've got a bad feeling about this. Wagner is only fun when he forgets whatever song he's supposed to be singing and just makes a series of weird atonal honks. And as last week's dreary, borderline-competent performance proved, he appears to be improving. Simon Cowell even said he enjoyed last week's song. Simon Cowell! What's fun about liking the same thing that Simon Cowell likes? Nothing, that's what. 9.03pm: Oh, there's been a problem. After the great big build-up, Dermot had to make awkward smalltalk with Louis before Wagner came on. What could have happened? I hope Wagner didn't eat anyone. Anyway, someone was going invariably to sing I'm Still Standing, and that someone turns out to be Wagner. It's not just a song, it's a bold claim that he can't be stopped. It's probably aimed directly at young Harry from One Direction, who Wagner allegedly got into a fight with a while ago. Of course, we'll know this for sure if the final verse is introduced with a roar of \"I'LL KILL YOU, YOU ADORABLE BASTARD! I'LL KILL YOU!!\" or if his performance involves bludgeoning a Bieber-haired pinata into dust with his fists and head. Oh, in actually fact the final verse is a cack-handed lurch into Circle Of Life, complete with weird Cirque Du Soleil staging. What did the last bit prove? I only wish I was able to tell you. 9.04pm: Louis just compared Wagner to a young Elton John. I wish I knew what was going on. I feel like a pensioner at an N-Dubz concert. 9.07pm: From the comments, about Wagner: loretorichard 13 November 2010 8:59PM Simon: \"He's like Louis. They're like two excited dogs\" - what they've both had sex with your leg? Oh, the comments section. I think I love you unconditionally. 9.10pm: I see that 'Vandross' is trending on Twitter. Nobody tell Louis, he'll be giddy with power. 9.12pm: And now for One Direction, who know they will get through so long as they wear nice sweaters and jump up and down and do at least one bit where they walk around behind the judges so what's the point in them even trying. It's just as well, really, because none of One Direction have much in common with Elton John. They would if Elton was two thirds lighter and his wig kept going all skew-whiff and slipping down his face, but that's clearly never going to happen. 9.13pm: One Direction are singing Something About The Way You Look Tonight, the B-side to Elton John's Diana song. At least that explains why the audience are screaming so much this week - it's because One Direction remind them of horrible car accidents. However, this is clearly One Direction's 'Look, we can sing!' moment, and it sort of works. Simon's going to say he could make a number one record out of this, isn't he? Bum. 9.16pm: Ah, no. But he does think that they'll win the competition. And not because they're his only remaining act or anything, but because... ah, no, hang on. It is because they're his only remaining band. Sorry. 9.22pm: Closing tonight's show is Rebecca, who seems to be emerging as the connoisseur's choice of X Factor winner. True, she might not have the tattoos or facial hair of Wagner, but on the plus side at least she hasn't got the tattoos or facial hair of Wagner. The danger with Rebecca is that she'll get stuck in a rut of only singing tedious ballads, and the audience will grow sick of her. But, hey, at least Rebecca went to see Harry Potter this week. If my memory is correct, she has been the only X Factor contestant to do so. 9.25pm: Ah, Candle In The Wind. The tedious ballad to end all tedious ballad. Fortunately this is the version about the woman who overdosed on barbiturates ages ago and not the version about the woman who died in a car crash quite recently, so at least it's not tasteless or anything. It's a very Rebecca performance, in that it's being performed flawlessly. It's just a shame that she's been given a total donkey of a song. Incidentally, does anyone else think that Cheryl Cole only knows about two Elton John songs? She's really picked some cack tonight. 9.29pm: And that's the end of another Saturday liveblog. Don't forget to swing by tomorrow night at eight for the separate Sunday result show liveblog when, as usual, Katie will be inexplicably saved by the judges. Without wanting to sound like a broken record, and an unpleasantly sincere one at that, thanks again for all your comments tonight. You're all brilliant, and you put my aimless wittering to total shame. Finally, don't forget to share your thoughts with me on Twitter (@stuheritage, in case you'd somehow forgotten). Until tomorrow!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
