James Bilton, 22, from York, told police that he had walked in his sleep since he was 13 and must have been sleepwalking when the alleged attack took place because he could not remember anything about it. The jury heard that Mr Bilton and a woman returned to his flat after a night out. He had put her to bed in his room while he slept on the sofa. Later, the 22-year-old woman claimed she had woken up to find him assaulting her. She denied consenting to sex. Mr Bilton said he had a history of sleepwalking which ran in the family. He could only remember waking up after sticking to the leather sofa and was \"completely oblivious\" to what had allegedly happened, York crown court heard. Ishaad Ebrahim, a sleep expert, said Mr Bilton did suffer from the condition and added sleepwalkers can carry out actions which they do when awake. The court was told between one and 2.5% of the adult population suffer from the condition and that of those, 4% carry out sexual behaviour while sleepwalking. Last month in Canada Jan Luedecke, 33, was acquitted of raping a woman after a judge ruled that he was asleep during the attack. Mr Luedecke and his alleged victim had both gone to a party in 2003 when the woman fell asleep on the sofa. When she awoke, she said she had found him having sex with her. At his trial for sexual assault, sleep experts and psychiatrists testified he suffered from \"sexsomnia\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
