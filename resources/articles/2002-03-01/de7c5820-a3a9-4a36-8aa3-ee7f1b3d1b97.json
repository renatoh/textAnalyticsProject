The meanings of beards from antiquity to the present day are teased and combed through with thoroughness and a chatty wit. He considers, too, the history of razors and the military connotations of facial hair. Beards have signified madness, respectability, spiritual superiority, genius or piratical rebellion, among many other things. Peterkin carefully taxonomises full beards, moustaches, sideburns and \"beaver beards\", rounding off his text with detailed instructions on how to trim and maintain your chosen \"facial hairstyle\". It is disappointing only that poet William Empson's legendary chin foliage does not earn him a place in the \"All-Stars in the Facial Hair Firmament\". Hmmm. Maybe it's time to grow a soul patch. The Body Electric: An Anatomy of the New Bionic Senses James Geary (Weidenfeld, \u00a320) If you want to go further than merely sprouting an interesting beard, you might consider pushing microchips under your skin and becoming a cyborg. While some people (notably an unretiring British academic, Kevin Warwick) do this for fun, cybernetic technology is also doing remarkable things for the injured, as Geary shows. There is the blind 63-year-old Belgian woman who can see again thanks to a retinal implant, and the 30-year-old Danish man, paralysed from the neck down after a motorcycle accident, who can now lift a cup of tea with his bionic arm. Geary also meets various robots and considers (with a mild scepticism) ideas of thought-control machines and electronic memory devices. They have the power to rebuild you. Michael Mann Mark Steensland (Pocket Essentials, \u00a33.99) Mann is that rare animal: an intelligent film director who can do downbeat, paranoiac atmospherics (The Insider) and storming action sequences featuring absurd amounts of guns (Heat) with equal \u00e9lan. Steensland's prose suffers from a disquieting infection with hanging participles, but his guide to Mann's work is nonetheless packed with useful information, each film being considered on the merits of story, research, shooting, design and music, and the way in which its protagonist fits the mould of \"the Mann man\": a dedicated loner who must enter a pact that threatens his self-control."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
