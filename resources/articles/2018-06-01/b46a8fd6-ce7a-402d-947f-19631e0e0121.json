Called Deadly Questions, the website allows users to write in questions and receive a personal response from one or more \u201cchampions\u201d. It is intended to help breach the gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Victorians ahead of negotiations of a treaty or treaties, preparation for which is slated to begin in earnest this year if legislation establishing the framework for the process passes parliament. The legislation is due to be debated on Tuesday. It was pushed back two weeks and faces a series of amendments proposed by Greens MP Lidia Thorpe, most of which were opposed by the government. The Deadly Questions \u201cchampions\u201d are all Aboriginal Victorians and include musician and Yorta Yorta man Adam Briggs, Gunditjmara film-maker and academic Richard Frankland, senior Wurundjeri elder Aunty Joy Murphy and Yorta Yorta Richmond Tigers AFLW player Natarsha Bamblett. Frankland said no question would be out of bounds. \u201cThis is an opportunity for any Australian to ask that question and say the thing that they are too scared to ask, or too afraid to ask,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cNot every Aboriginal person will agree with this and neither should they have to, because we are all different.\u201d Offensive and racist language will be screened out, but questions that have at their base a racist assumption will not. Rebutting those assumptions is part of the aim of the project, Frankland said. Questions already listed on the site include: \u201cIs being Aboriginal just the colour of your skin?\u201d and \u201cWhy don\u2019t we see many Aboriginal people around the city?\u201d Frankland directed video responses to many of the questions. He also answered a number, including \u201cWhy can\u2019t Aboriginal people get over the past?\u201d He responded: \u201cI often get asked: \u2018why don\u2019t you people get over it?\u2019 I can\u2019t be healed, I can\u2019t get over it, until my non-Aboriginal colleagues get over it, until we stop living with the nursery version of history.\u201d Other questions include: \u201cWhy should I be sorry for something I didn\u2019t do?\u201d and \u201cCan you get more welfare if you\u2019re Aboriginal?\u201d, both of which were answered by Briggs. In response to the former, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t need every whitefella with dreadlocks to come up and tell me he\u2019s sorry. I need true acknowledgement and that comes from the top down, from the government.\u201d Wemba Wemba actor and academic Carissa Lee said she was initially apprehensive about taking part, but also saw it as a way to help her community by correcting harmful assumptions. Lee said reconciliation was the work of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, but \u201cwe have a lot more at stake about how we approach it\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s this power imbalance of people that are having to sacrifice bits of themselves to white people as a consequence of having to answer questions \u2026 We don\u2019t get to just exist in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cIn Deadly Questions, I feel as though there\u2019s been a priority to make sure that the questions that get through are safe, that they are not hurtful.\u201d Yorta Yorta elder Aunty Pam Pederson said educating non-Indigenous people was a way to continue the work of her parents: footballer, leader and Aborigines Advancement League co-founder Sir Douglas Nicholls and Lady Gladys Nicholls. She has observed similar conversations with some fairly prominent players. \u201cI met the Queen a few times and Prince Philip; back in the old days, [prime ministers] Robert Menzies and Harold Holt,\u201d she said. \u201cMum and Dad raised me to step into their shoes, and this is what I am doing.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
