That was England's mistake: they conceded too many goals. \"We are not the best team in the world but we know how to play effectively, how to keep things tight at the back, and we're always capable of scoring goals. \"People accuse us of not being the most attractive team in the world, but I don't remember anyone getting a championship medal or a cup just for playing nice football.\" \"People say we've taken football backwards but I don't mind doing that and going home with the cup,\" said the Bolton midfielder Stelios Giannakopoulos. \"You have to find a mixture that gives you results and that's what we did. We used the weapons we have and our defensive line is one of those. If you believe in yourself, you can do something special. We did it and this is the magic of football.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
