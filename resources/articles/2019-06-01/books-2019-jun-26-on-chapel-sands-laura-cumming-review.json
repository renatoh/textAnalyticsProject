It was autumn, with few people around, but after \u201ca prolonged moment of parental inattention\u201d, the three-year-old had gone. The police were called to investigate but no one in the village of Chapel St Leonard had seen anything. For Betty\u2019s parents, Veda (who had taken her to the beach) and George (summoned from where he had got to that week in his job as a travelling salesman), the next few days were a nightmare. But this wasn\u2019t an abduction like James Bulger\u2019s or Madeleine McCann\u2019s. Not only did Betty turn up safe, in a house 12 miles inland. The circumstances that led to her being snatched were shrouded in secrets and lies. Until Veda and George adopted her, just a few weeks previously, Betty had been called Grace. The person who took her was a relative, not a stranger. And far from knowing nothing, people locally \u2013 locked in \u201cacts of communal silence\u201d that would continue for decades \u2013 knew far more than they let on. The drama of Betty\u2019s disappearance makes a brilliant opening chapter. But Cumming\u2019s mother (now in her early 90s) has no memory of her first three years and didn\u2019t learn about the kidnapping for half a century. The real story of the book isn\u2019t how she was taken from Chapel Sands but what was taken from her: the truth about who her parents were and why she was adopted; the reason a woman approached her in her teens and said: \u201cYour grandmother wants to see you,\u201d when the only grandmother she had known was dead. The book is a series of revelations: one twist the reader may foresee early on (just as Betty herself guessed it as a teenager), but most come out of the blue. They keep on coming right to the end, with each new surprise forcing Cumming to reappraise the story and to modify her views of the protagonists, not least George. To begin with he\u2019s the villain of the piece, because of the loveless regime in which Betty was brought up. After the kidnapping, he kept her on a tight leash. She wasn\u2019t allowed to play with other children or walk the half mile to the shops; by the age of 10, she had travelled no further than Skegness, seven miles away. At home he barked out brisk instructions: sit up straight, don\u2019t play with your food, finish what\u2019s on your plate. He and Veda were already 49 when Betty came to them and, with a short temper made worse by his bronchitis and lumbago, he hadn\u2019t the temperament to give her the love she needed. Nor had the gentle, self-effacing Veda the temperament to withstand his tyranny. Or so Cumming infers from the memoir she persuaded her mother to write about her childhood (generous extracts from it are quoted as evidence). The low point came when George removed Betty from Skegness Grammar School, to which she had won a scholarship at 10 and where, despite her shyness, she had begun to flourish in drama and art. School was a blessed escape from George but when she was 16 he curtailed that freedom by installing her at the village post office, where she worked for 18 months in a windowless cubicle, more cut off from the world than ever. She did eventually get away to art college, first in Nottingham then in Edinburgh, where she married. She slipped her name, too, dropping Betty in favour of Elizabeth. Her relationship with George didn\u2019t recover. When he died a few years later, she skipped the funeral. Then again, life for George \u2013 an orphan at 13 \u2013 had been miserable, too. He scraped a living selling industrial soaps and was looked down on by his snooty brother-in-law, Captain Green (husband of Veda\u2019s younger sister), from whom he rented a modest terraced house. The Captain\u2019s own house, a vast mansion overlooking the sea, was just up the road. More to the point, George cared enough about Betty to make some lovely toys for her, including a miniature theatre. He took many photos of her too, and there\u2019s an especially beautiful one of Veda, Vermeer-like in its composition, which shows an artistic side to George that, had his life been less hard, might have been allowed to flourish. Cumming\u2019s parents were both artists and she is the Observer\u2019s art critic. Among the painters she insightfully alludes to in making sense of her mother\u2019s story are Vuillard, Ravilious, Fra Angelico, Seurat, Degas, Turner and, most tellingly, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, whose Landscape with the Fall of Icarus depicts the failure of a coastal population to see or acknowledge a traumatic event. It\u2019s family photos that preoccupy her, though: in the absence of oral or written evidence other than her mother\u2019s, she relies on images to interpret the past. She does it skilfully, teasing out memories where none exist. But you can read too much into poses and expressions (Shakespeare: \u201cThere\u2019s no art to find the mind\u2019s construction in the face\u201d). And as new material slowly comes to light, she\u2019s forced to reassess what she thinks the pictures tell her: \u201cLife reproves the imagination: look closer.\u201d Looking closer, and helping her mother look closer, she arrives by stages at the truth of Betty\u2019s parentage and the tangles of her first three years. Even humdrum mysteries \u2013 why the baker delivered bread to everyone\u2019s house but hers \u2013 fall into place. A duplicate photo, with \u201cWe Love You\u201d written on it, helps solve the deeper mystery of what it cost those involved when Betty was given up for adoption \u2013 a great deal, emotionally, though as it turns out the adoption agreement had no legal standing. To say any more would be a disservice to Cumming, who\u2019s adept in knowing how much to disclose and when to hold back. Amassing the evidence and sifting through it has taken her half a lifetime and the book\u2019s structure mirrors that process. The book is a love letter to her mother, whose warmth, articulacy and survival instincts shine through. It\u2019s also an intimate portrait of a village community, with its storybook characters (butcher, baker, dairyman, bell-ringer, gravedigger) and their wonderful old-fashioned names (Lily Boddice, Bert Parrish, Polly Graves). The nostalgia is tempered by an awareness of how repressed and small-minded village life could be and, as people drown in dykes or go missing at sea, how prone to calamity; in spirit and setting, On Chapel Sands is more like Graham Swift\u2019s Waterland than Dylan Thomas\u2019s Under Milk Wood. Still, Cumming\u2019s affection for Lincolnshire runs deep. She knows Chapel St Leonards from childhood holidays and also writes well about Skegness, which by the 1930s, thanks to its pleasure palace, putting green, miniature railway and Butlin\u2019s holiday camp, had become a tourist haven \u2013 a \u201cgarden city by the sea\u201d. There\u2019s even a rollcall of the county\u2019s famous names, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Isaac Newton and Thomas Paine among them. Cumming is careful not to intrude on the narrative; it\u2019s her mother\u2019s story, not her own. But she owns up to certain inherited traits. And though her mother could never forgive George, Cumming does, finding his better nature and letting her anger with him wash out to sea. \u2022 On Chapel Sands is published by Chatto &amp; Windus.
