England's Andrew Flintoff reacted to a series-squaring victory by pulling his shirt off and cavorting around the outfield displaying a torso the colour of a block of beef dripping, but with slightly better muscle definition. Parents whose toddlers respond to exposure to fresh air by flinging clothes and nappies into the nearest flowerbed and waddling around naked, chubby and gurgling might have seen in Freddie's actions an innocent, childlike glee. Others might have suspected something altogether darker and more complex. The Lancastrian has often been criticised as a player for whom the term fast bowler contained an s too many. Since Aston Villa's David Ginola likewise exposed himself to the public after his manager John Gregory had remarked he was carrying \"too much timber\", might it not be that Freddie's shirtless gallop was less simple exuberance than a subliminal message to the world? A defiant attempt to show that he is no longer a man for whom the expression all-rounder is as much physical summary as job description? \"As a psychologist I wouldn't like to comment on the reasons why he did it,\" says Caroline Marlow of the Sport Performance, Assessment &amp; Research Centre at the University of Surrey, \"but as a woman I'd have to say, I rather wish he hadn't.\" Welcome or not, Flintoff's topless merriment puts him in good company. With the exception of racing drivers and cyclists, both of whom tend to pile more and more sponsored gear on as victory approaches, most sportsmen these days take the slightest whiff of triumph as a sign to start ripping their kit off (sportswomen are altogether more circumspect. Unless, like Brandi Chastain, they happen to be wearing a Nike sports bra). Ryan Giggs famously removed his shirt after scoring against Arsenal in the FA Cup semi-final. In doing so the Welsh winger revealed a body so lavishly garlanded with downy fuzz that many viewers were reminded of an immature penguin (though, admittedly, probably only those middle-aged, male viewers whose own torsos don't so much ripple as wobble). Tennis players, meanwhile, have taken to hurling their dirty laundry into the crowd with the thoughtlessness of a student sighting mother. On his return to Croatia after his Wimbledon triumph, Goran Ivanisevic took things a stage further, responding to the supportive throng by throwing everything at them save his supportive thong. \"You could say it's retro-active in nature,\" says Andrew Walton of the present spate of strip-off celebrations. A principal counselling psychologist who has worked as a consultant to the British Olympic Association, Walton says it may all be \"a playing out of the need for sportsmen to divest themselves of unnecessary accoutrements that might otherwise hamper their attempts to achieve their goals\". Or perhaps the men's singles champion was simply pre-empting the inevitable. After all, when Roma won the scudetto last season with a final-day victory over Parma, fans at the Stadio Olimpico invaded the pitch and stripped the players to their underpants in the quest for souvenirs. As the tifosi were chased away by police, one of their victims, the curly-haired Roma midfielder Damiano Tommasi stood in the centre circle with the bewildered look of a man who has just woken from a dream in which he is walking naked through crowds of people only to find it is really happening. Sprinters were arguably the inventors of the modern passion for self-exposure among male athletes, blessed as they are with an almost Jordanesque passion for displaying their expensively sculpted bosoms to the world. Walton cites this pre- and post-race chest-bearing as an example of sportsmen's at times primal behaviour: an attempt to frighten their rivals. \"Warriors tend to expose or exaggerate the parts of their body most likely to intimidate their enemies,\" he says. \"The chest is an important part of male power. We know, for example, that the Roman emperors wore elaborate ornamental breastplates as a symbol of their authority.\" A decade ago the Nigerian football team turned up for an African Nations Cup qualifier in Burkina Faso without their shorts. With the crowd growing restless and the match officials threatening to award the tie to the opposition, the Super Eagles left the dressing room in cut-off tracksuit bottoms. Sadly the seams of these improvised garments proved unsuitable for the rigours of competitive action and soon the Nigerians were revealing rather more of their talents than they might have liked. At the time the players and the Nigerian FA regarded the event as a resounding humiliation. In the age of the shirtless Flintoff you can't help viewing it more as a groundbreaking moment. Sport, it appears, is increasingly filled with men who, as was once said of the former US presidential candidate Gary Hart, can't keep their pants on in a crisis. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
