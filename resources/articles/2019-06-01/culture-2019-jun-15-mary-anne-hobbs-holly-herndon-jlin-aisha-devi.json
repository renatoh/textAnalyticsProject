Sometimes, things fall into place so quickly it seems that serendipity had a hidden hand in proceedings. \u201cThese things are often very complex and require a lot of dialogue, because of the way the world works. It\u2019s a remarkable moment when something like this coalesces so quickly,\u201d says Mary Anne Hobbs of her Queens of the Electronic Underground show at the 02 Ritz. \u201cAll of the artists involved immediately wanted to do it. It was beautiful for me, with everyone so excited to play alongside the others. We all wondered: \u2018Why hasn\u2019t this happened before?\u2019\u201d The DJ\u2019s excitement around the show is evident. Her eagerly awaited night features some of the most creative, groundbreaking electronic artists working today. Hobbs, who worked with MIF previously on 2017\u2019s Dark Matter show, seems genuinely thrilled to be able to bring Jlin, Holly Herndon, Katie Gately, Klara Lewis and A\u00efsha Devi together for the festival: \u201cWe\u2019re breaking new ground here. As a creator, I\u2019ve been given licence to dream.\u201d From Devi\u2019s collaboration with visual artist MFO and Jlin\u2019s choreography-inspired beats, to Herndon\u2019s adventures in AI creativity, the show promises to be a state-of-the-art audiovisual spectacular. A fierce advocate for female artists from across all genres (her 6 Music show features a weekly All Queens Mix), Hobbs was keen to provide a showcase for female creativity: \u201cThe show is a major creative statement, with feminism imbued in that. There are so many women making music of every flavour and texture. If you can create moments like this to give these women a special platform, it\u2019s the greatest step for feminism you can make.\u201d She continues: \u201cI\u2019m asked all the time, \u2018Where are the women making electronic music?\u2019 If you don\u2019t know, you\u2019re looking in all the wrong places.\u201d The MIF19 show is certainly the right place. And it\u2019s just a taste of the talent to be found working in electronic music: \u201cWe could probably do six months of shows, every night if we wanted to. It\u2019s a real joy for me.\u201d Queens of the new age Mary Anne Hobbs talks us through what to expect from each artist at the showcase Holly Herndon: \u201cOne of the most exciting pioneers of electronic music today. Holly is building whole new relationships with machines and AI. I think she really understands the value of integration with technology. She\u2019s creating high art collaboratively in new ways by mentoring and teaching machines. \u201cShe told me herself: \u2018It\u2019s going to be wild.\u2019\u201d Jlin: \u201cA footwork artist, her rhythm patterns are the most exciting you\u2019ll hear anywhere in the world today. Jlin is a pivotal addition to this bill. You\u2019ll see a set that you won\u2019t be able to experience in any other place, she\u2019s making it specifically for this moment. It makes my heart sing.\u201d Katie Gately: \u201cColor was extraordinary: it\u2019s a subversive, dazzling modern pop record. Katie\u2019s a fascinating sound designer, working with found sounds and also creating the sounds she wants to use herself. \u201cShe\u2019s ready to step on from where she left off with Color, and introduce us to a brand new palette.\u201d Klara Lewis: \u201cKlara makes very minimal, brooding, angular music. She calls it \u2018theatre for the ear\u2019. I\u2019ve wanted to work with her for a long time, and I\u2019ve always been fascinated by how her work will be interpreted in a live space. I can\u2019t wait to see how it unfolds.\u201d A\u00efsha Devi: \u201cA\u00efsha is a highly unpredictable, really radical artist. She\u2019s based in Berlin, and is really interested in the rituals of club life and club music. She\u2019s working with a visual artist called MFO on a special collaborative piece, which is the initial reason we put a huge screen into the venue. It\u2019s incredibly exciting.\u201d \u2022 Queens of the Electronic Underground is at the O2 Ritz, Whitworth Street West, Manchester M1 5NQ on 20 July \u2022 The Guardian is a media partner of Manchester international festival."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
