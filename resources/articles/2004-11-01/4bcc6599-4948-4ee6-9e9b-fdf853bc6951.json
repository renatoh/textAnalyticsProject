Andrew Caldecott QC, the lawyer acting for the Daily Star, which has been accused of contempt of court for an article that revealed the footballers' names, said Mr Clifford's comments to newspapers at the time suggested the girl knew who her assailants had been. This would undermine the case against the Daily Star, he said, because if there was a \"real possibility\" that she had known or learned who they were it would mean the Star's article could not have presented a risk to justice. But Philip Havers QC, the lawyer for the attorney general, which is bringing the case against the Daily Star over a news report on October 23 last year, said it was not possible to depend on what Mr Clifford was reported to have said for evidence. \"No reliance can be placed on what a newspaper attributes to him,\" he said. Particularly at issue between the two sides are remarks attributed to Mr Clifford in the Sun on October 7. He was reported to have said: \"The girl's father told me she had given police the names of three Premiership players as those who allegedly raped her. I do not know all the circumstances but I know she saw police on Friday when she had an HIV test but I presume she identified the players then.\" Commenting on these remarks, Mr Caldecott said: \"He is plainly under the impression that she knows the identities, and secondly that she has told the police. The fact that he is almost certainly wrong about the second does not by any stretch of the imagination mean that he is wrong about the first. \"Any person in a responsible position would wish to raise with Mr Clifford how on earth did he come to say this or has he been inaccurately reported and if he was inaccurately reported what has he done about it?\" Police records show that the girl did not name any of the men in her interviews with them, though she did say one of them had told her he played for Newcastle United, and another was called \"Karl, Carl or Carlton\". The two players at the centre of the allegations were Titus Bramble of Newcastle United and Carlton Cole, a Chelsea player on loan to Charlton Athletic. No case was brought against them or the two other suspects arrested in October, Nicholas Meikle and Jason Edwards, because the Crown Prosecution Service had insufficient evidence. Mr Havers pointed out that Mr Clifford's quoted remarks in the Sun had the number of footballers as three, when in fact only two were arrested later that week. Mr Caldecott said that it was highly unlikely that Mr Clifford had not found out who the players in question were given that papers such as the Sun and the News of the World seemed to have found out just a week after the story first surfaced, on September 29. \"If the papers knew, it's highly unlikely that Mr Clifford did not know. The value of the story largely turns on the identity of the footballers,\" he said. But Mr Havers said that Mr Clifford would not have told the girl who the players were, for the very reason that it would have affected the value of the story. \"Putting it frankly, her value as a media commodity would have been on the one hand enormously enhanced by a successful prosecution and on the other hand significantly reduced were the case to have failed to get to trial or collapsed at trial. \"If Mr Clifford is the man the respondents suggest he is he would have known what the value of her to him would have been and the last thing he would have done would be anything that would have adversely affected her value.\" Mr Caldecott also said information about the players had gradually leaked out long before the Star's article on October 23, limiting its potential impact. He said newspapers had found out who the players were soon after the story broke and had encouraged speculation about their identity with a \"progressive dropping of clues\". He said that the evidence that the newspapers knew the players' identity was \"overwhelming\", given that both the Sun and the News of the World published photographs of the two players, with their faces obscured, on October 5 and October 6. The News of the World ran an interview with Mr Meikle, on October 5, in which he claimed the sex between the alleged victim and the men had been consensual. The following day, the Sun published a response from the girl in which Mr Clifford was quoted as saying that she \"totally refute[d] Meikle's account\" of what happened on the night of September 27. These articles were among the voluminous media coverage of the story that Mr Caldecott said had provided \"pointers\" to the identity of the footballers, which could have helped enable the girl to find out their names before the Star's article appeared, he said. \"It's a near certainty that the complainant must have known the club sides of the two individuals, their ages, their colour and the probability that they were English. \"It's highly probable that either she or her friends or her family would have accessed club internet sites, particularly the two of Newcastle and Chelsea to see who they could be. \"It's at least likely that she would have told her close friends and certainly her family what clues she had as to their identity and would have drawn assistance from [details published about] their age, colour, build, photos and so on.\" Mr Caldecott admitted that the Star had made a \"big mistake\" when it committed the \"blunder\" of publishing an article that named the footballers. \"We accept it was a big mistake and apologise to the court for it,\" he said, saying that he spoke on behalf of Peter Hill, the Daily Express editor who was at that time in charge of the Star, and who was present in court today. He said the article stood out from much of the coverage because it was \"completely devoid of sensation\". It was an oversight that the \"short news account\" had ignored advice from the attorney general and Metropolitan Police not to reveal the footballers' identity, he said. One of the judges sitting in the case, Mr Justice Pitchford, suggested that the fact that a picture of one of the footballers had been pixelated, suggested a degree of judgement, and that in that case it was strange that the attorney general's advice had been overlooked. Mr Caldecott replied: \"The sheer irrationality of what happened is redolent of a bad mistake.\" The judges said at the end of today's proceedings that they would deliver their judgement at 2pm tomorrow. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
