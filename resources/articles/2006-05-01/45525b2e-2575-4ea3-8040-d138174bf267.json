He warned that the challenges facing the government- from battling terrorism and poverty to the provision of affordable housing - would not be tackled unless it was profitable to do so. At the CBI's annual dinner, which was attended by Tony Blair, Mr Sunderland attacked what he described as the myths that only the public sector could be trusted to behave ethically, to give value to the taxpayer, to care about the poor and understand the need for public provision. He cited the example of the National Health Service where, in the three years to 2007, the budget would have increased from \u00a365bn to \u00a3107bn, but every day brought news that hospital trusts were in deficit and wards were closing. \"If this is the best the so-called 'ethical' public sector can do with our NHS ... maybe it's time we brought in more of the boys from the private sector.\" Mr Sunderland drew attention to what he saw as the contribution of a profitable private sector: \u00a3104bn in corporate and business taxes and national insurance contributions; another \u00a320bn from petrol revenues, the climate change levy and other areas. \"So, to paraphrase Monty Python, apart from 23 million jobs, pensions, new schools, more hospitals and better roads ... what has business ever done for this country?\" He added: \"There is a simple choice before this country between recognising the importance of profit or stagnation.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
