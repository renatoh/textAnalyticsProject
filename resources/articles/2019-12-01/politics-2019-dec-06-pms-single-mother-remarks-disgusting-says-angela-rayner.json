The senior Labour figure said his words were \u201cdisgusting\u201d, reminded her of school bullies and were part of the Tories\u2019 historic stigmatisation of the working class. Johnson wrote in an article in the Spectator magazine before he was a politician in 1995 that single mothers were raising a generation of \u201cill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate children\u201d. He has claimed repeatedly the lines in that piece have been taken out of context. Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said: \u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely disgusting. I remember people like that making those comments about me. \u201cI might be the shadow education secretary, but inside I\u2019m that 16-year-old that didn\u2019t think I was worth anything. And people like him make women who are already vulnerable feel that they\u2019re the problem. They\u2019re not the problem.\u201d Rayner, 39, who was a care worker and union representative, said Johnson\u2019s attitude felt like the kind of bullying she experienced in the playground. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s the same. People in positions of power who think they\u2019re a cut above the other people. I didn\u2019t want to feel ashamed. I wanted to be the best mum I could be. I just wanted the means to be able to help myself. \u201cAnd, luckily for me, I had a Sure Start centre and I had adult education I could go back into. I had a council house waiting for me. All of those things have been dismantled now.\u201d Historic attitudes to single mothers shown by the Conservative party have been recirculated during the general election campaign and Rayner is not the only Labour politician to speak out. Sarah Jones, the candidate for Croydon Central, had her first child at university when she was 19 in 1992. She said that watching the then Tory secretary of state for social security, Peter Lilley, address a party conference that year, where he claimed women were getting pregnant to jump the housing queue and \u201cwere benefit offenders\u201d, was the reason she joined Labour. Rayner, who is defending her seat in Ashton-under-Lyne, said she remembers the same message from the party as a young woman. She said: \u201cI didn\u2019t deserve to be stigmatised and I remember Tory ministers at the time saying people like me were getting pregnant to get council houses. \u201cThat whole stigmatisation of working-class people is despicable. And it\u2019s disgusting to make people feel that somehow they\u2019re not worth it.\u201d Johnson was asked on Thursday in an interview on ITV\u2019s This Morning if he understood his past comments were hurtful. He said: \u201cOf course, of course,\u201d adding: \u201cBut I don\u2019t think this is the time to talk about articles that were written a very long time ago.\u201d He said the party was investing in childcare for mothers and Sure Start services. Education reform has been a central plank of Labour\u2019s manifesto for the general election, with pledges to create a National Education Service, to reopen Sure Start centres that have shut over the past decade, to cap class sizes at 30, and to provide free university tuition and access to adult education. Rayner has also turned her sights on school uniforms, pledging to cap their overall price and bring back grants for families and carers to go towards their cost. She said she spent \u00a3450 on her own son\u2019s uniform for classroom and PE lessons last September and many families cannot afford such huge costs. Not having the right uniform affects children \u201cmassively\u201d, she said during her visit to a school in the Tory marginal Walsall North, and sometimes leads to children not wanting to attend school. Reflecting on her own childhood growing up in Stockport, she said: \u201cIt leads to bullying. It leads to feeling like you\u2019re not as good as the next person. Children especially at secondary school know that their parents are in poverty. \u201cI remember I had to have steel toecaps because my nana said, \u2018They\u2019ll last\u2019, and I remember being bullied because my shoes weren\u2019t like anyone else\u2019s. Everyone had Kickers.\u201d She said she was given her brother\u2019s shirts, which were grey, not white, rarely had a coat and did her own hair from an extremely young age. \u201cEvery one called me scruffy, a scratter, that\u2019s what they used to call me. I was known as that. Scratter was the nickname. [I had that] stigma of being the poor kid.\u201d She said plain jumpers and clothes in plain colours that families can buy from a cheaper supplier rather than an exclusive school supplier were crucial, as well as trying to take the focus out of a strict uniform policy being a benchmark of a school\u2019s success and image. She said under academisation, schools had become increasingly marketised with uniform taking a central role. \u201cUniforms are important, I accept that, it could be a force for good \u2026 but it\u2019s now used as a tool to segregate children in poverty, is totally unacceptable and action has to be taken,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
