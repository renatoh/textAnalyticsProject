To me, that's what waking up on a weekday is like. Once I'm on the bus, Lovin' in my Baby's Eyes offers a shift in mood - how bad can life be if you have the love of a good woman and a seat on the bus? Deltron's 3030 is a departure from the gangsta nonsense I've come to find distasteful, but it's enough to remind me that I should be straight reppin' my bus route here. The 133 to Liverpool Street! That's followed by God Only Knows, the closest thing to a perfect song I know. I like to save Blood of a Young Wolf for 5pm - it's tired, reflective and epic music for the end of a long day. 1 Imperium Machine Head 2 Lovin' in my Baby's Eyes Taj Mahal 3 3030 Deltron 3030 4 God Only Knows The Beach Boys 5 Blood of a Young Wolf Buck 65 \u00b7 Share your commuting soundtrack with us.
