Tory MPs said they had been \u201cspooked\u201d by suggestions from ministers that the four-week lockdown could be extended should the infection rate remain high. Senior MPs have asked to see the full economic impact assessment given to the cabinet before they vote on the new restrictions on Wednesday. On Monday, Conservative whips, government scientists and Johnson increased their private efforts to contain any rebellion, in what one MP called a \u201cday of propaganda\u201d. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, also intensified his attacks on the government\u2019s decision to delay a national lockdown \u2013 and blamed the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, for blocking an earlier \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d, which Starmer said could have saved lives. \u201cForty days later, when [the prime minister] finally decided to announce a longer, four-week national lockdown \u2026 figures had increased to 326 deaths a day, and 22,000 Covid cases. That is the human cost of the government\u2019s inaction,\u201d Starmer told the CBI conference. In a direct attack on Sunak, he added: \u201cThe impact on business, and jobs, will be severe. Make no mistake, the chancellor\u2019s name is all over this.\u201d Labour will back the new restrictions, meaning the government will not risk losing the vote. But there are fears in Downing Street about the potential embarrassment of any future vote depending on Labour support to pass, if enough Conservatives decide to rebel. Sir Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, who is likely to vote against the government, said: \u201cI think it is essential that the government should publish a full impact assessment of its proposed lockdown before MPs are asked to vote on Wednesday. \u201cWe know from experience that lockdowns don\u2019t defeat the virus, they merely defer its spread, and the cost is substantial in terms of jobs destroyed, businesses that will fail, mental health \u2013 especially for the young \u2013 and other health consequences which mean lockdowns cost lives as well as saving them.\u201d Charles Walker, the vice-chair of the 1922 Committee, predicted there would be just 15 Conservative rebels for the vote but said there was \u201chuge disquiet on the Conservative benches\u201d, which could cause issues later down the line. \u201cI will be voting against the legislation on Wednesday because I\u2019m fed up of having decent people criminalised,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I expect the whips\u2019 office will pick off a number of other heretics to make sure they are at worst abstaining or even better, in the government lobby supporting them.\u201d One Tory MP from the former Labour heartland \u201cred wall\u201d areas, said despite deep scepticism they planned to back the new lockdown. \u201cI just honestly don\u2019t see what the alternative is. I hate it, it\u2019s awful, but what else can you do? I think a lot of colleagues feel like that. \u201cGoing forward, we need to see more of the data and scientific advice they look at and accept or reject in the decision-making process. What are the economic impact projections that they consider? How are the decisions actually made?\u201d One MP, who has not rebelled previously on Covid-19 legislation, said a vote to extend the lockdown could be \u201cbruising\u201d for the government unless there was \u201cseriously convincing evidence that there was no other alternative\u201d. MPs will get a vote on what replaces the lockdown restrictions before they expire on 2 December. \u201cThe intention of the government is to go back to the tier system on a local and regional basis,\u201d Johnson\u2019s spokesman said. Should the R (reproduction) number continue to be above 1, Johnson will be under pressure to continue the harsh restrictions. The spokesman said the government would examine the data throughout the four-week lockdown. \u201cWe believe the package of measures is tough enough to get the R \u2026 down again and allow us to go down to that regional approach,\u201d he said. Earlier on Monday, Sunak refused to rule out the coronavirus lockdown lasting longer than its intended four weeks, a reiteration of what his cabinet colleague Michael Gove said over the weekend. Speaking in the Commons, Johnson sought to persuade mutinous Conservative backbenchers to support his plan for a new coronavirus lockdown across England, saying that failing to act now would risk the \u201cmedical and moral disaster\u201d of an overwhelmed NHS. The prime minister also rejected the idea he had been too slow to act, saying it had been right to first try a regional system of different tiers of restrictions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
