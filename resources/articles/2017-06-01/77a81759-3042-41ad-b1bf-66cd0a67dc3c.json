The England goalkeeper, who will sit out the friendly fixture against France in Paris on Tuesday with Gareth Southgate expected to offer Jack Butland a first appearance in 15 months, was a high-profile early victim of Pep Guardiola\u2019s tenure at the Etihad Stadium and has just completed a season-long loan at Torino in Serie A. The Italian club are not seeking to make that transfer permanent, with the coach, Sinisa Mihajlovic, suggesting they cannot afford Hart\u2019s \u00a3110,000-a-week wages, but Hart has not spoken personally to anyone at City since rejoining the ranks. The club have since signed the uncapped Brazilian goalkeeper Ederson from Benfica for \u00a335m to leave Hart in no doubt that he has no future at the club he joined 11 years ago. No clubs have crystallised their interest as yet, and it may be that Hart has to accept an opportunity outside the elite bracket, and potentially a pay cut, at the likes of West Ham United, Everton, Newcastle United or Crystal Palace if he is to secure a move to another Premier League side. \u201cSomething\u2019s going to happen, one way or another, but it\u2019s almost in the hands of the businessmen now,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have obviously signed the new keeper, and I get the direction [in which they are moving]. There is no real need for me to talk to them. I\u2019m lucky enough to have management who deal with that side of things. I think they spoke to my agent. There is no animosity between the two teams; they are going about their business, and we are going to go about ours. \u201cLook, I would love to give you a poker-straight answer as to where I\u2019ll be next season, but I\u2019ve got nothing at the moment. I\u2019d love to be \u2018withholding information\u2019 about my future, but I don\u2019t have the information to withhold. People are focused on international duty and respecting that players are focused on international duty. Come Tuesday night, after that is when conversations can be had and people can start being real. My personal situation is interesting, and patience is going to have to be the key.\u201d City have now spent more than \u00a350m on Ederson and Claudio Bravo since Guardiola determined Hart\u2019s distribution from the back was not of the standard he required, and that pair are now competing for the No1 jersey at the Etihad. Asked if he knew what the club\u2019s asking price for him would be, Hart said: \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly. It\u2019s hard to say what is \u2018realistic\u2019. Football is a business, at the end of the day. You can\u2019t judge, realistically. The millions and zillions of pounds that get paid for someone to come and play football for you, in the real world, is strange. In the business world, the football world, it\u2019s not. \u201cBut I certainly don\u2019t think they are going to try and price me out of a move. I think there\u2019s enough respect between the player and club to work together. There\u2019s no point in working against [each other]. There is no animosity between the two. They are going in their direction and I need to go in mine. It\u2019s about what is considered to be market value and what gets agreed between the two clubs.\u201d Yet Hart, who kept five clean sheets in 36 games for Torino and was criticised by the club president, Urbano Cairo, who claimed to have been \u201csurprised\u201d at the number of mistakes the goalkeeper made, has conceded his departure will have to be on a permanent move. \u201cIf the switch is what needs to happen, and that\u2019s key, then we all need stability in our life,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a kid any more. I can\u2019t just pack my stuff, like a 17 or 19-year-old, and go on loan. I am a 30-year-old man with stuff I need to organise. I like stability.\u201d \u201cThere is an ideal situation to come out of this but nothing is perfect. It\u2019s a short career and football is crazy, so I have to be prepared for anything. I just want to play football. I love football. It\u2019s what I live and breathe, and I want to play football at the highest possible level I can play. That\u2019s the plan.\u201d The England goalkeeper was beaten by two late Leigh Griffiths free-kicks at Hampden Park on Saturday, before Harry Kane salvaged a point in stoppage time, and his absence at the Stade de France will be one of a number of changes to Southgate\u2019s side. Butland has not represented his country since fracturing his ankle in a friendly win in Germany in March 2016 and is likely to start, with Fraser Forster and Tom Heaton also in the squad."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
