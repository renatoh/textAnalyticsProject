The Michael Bell-trained son of Marju has been a model of consistency this season, finishing fourth in the Craven Stakes on his reappearance. He then ran a cracker to be fifth in the Sagitta 2000 Guineas back at Newmarket, and went one place better next time in the Irish equivalent at the Curragh. His last run saw him finish seventh in the Jersey Stakes at Royal Ascot. \"He is in good and form and working very nicely indeed,\" said Tim Jones, spokesman for owners Highclere Thoroughbred Racing. \"He's a horse who is better with a little bit of cut in the ground, so we are working towards an autumn campaign as he has had a fairly busy spring and summer. \"We've got numerous options for him over the next month or so, including the Prix Daphnis, a Group Three over nine furlongs at Maisons-Laffite at the end of this month (July 27) or, alternatively, we could go the conditions race route with him.\" While Saturn has not raced beyond a mile this term, he did win over a mile as a juvenile, suggesting he may get further. \"He does have a lot of speed although I would quite like to see him run over further but with a little bit of restraint,\" Jones said. \"So we might consider running him over 10 furlongs in a conditions race at Haydock (on July 19). We would like a nice confidence-boosting win under his belt.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
