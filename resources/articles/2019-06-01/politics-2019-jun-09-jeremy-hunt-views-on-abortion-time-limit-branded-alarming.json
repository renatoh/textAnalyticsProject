Hunt, a former health secretary, said it was still his view that abortions should only be allowed for women up to 12 weeks after conception, but he said he would not seek to change the law on it if he became prime minister. Asked about the issue on Sky\u2019s Ridge on Sunday programme, Hunt said: \u201cThese are matters of conscience, yes, my view hasn\u2019t changed on that. I respect the fact other people have very different views and that\u2019s why these matters are matters for free votes in the House of Commons.\u201d His comments were branded \u201calarming\u201d by the Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine, who said it was an attack on women\u2019s rights. \u201cIt is incredibly alarming to see the former health secretary and a candidate in the race to be the next prime minister hold such a view,\u201d she said. \u201cRather than attacking the women\u2019s rights we already have in some parts of the UK, the Tories should be fighting for them to be equal in Northern Ireland. \u201cSo far the Tory leadership race has shown how out of touch many of those putting themselves forward are. The Liberal Democrats demand better for the UK and think that women across the UK, especially in Northern Ireland, deserve better.\u201d Another Lib Dem MP, Layla Moran, said Hunt\u2019s comments showed it was \u201cone step forward, two steps back\u201d on women\u2019s rights. \u201cThe fight is never over for progressive politics. And this from the man who used to be in charge of the NHS,\u201d she said. The Labour MP and women\u2019s rights campaigner Jess Phillips said: \u201cDid this one say he was a feminist? It\u2019s hard to keep up with who\u2019s on drugs and who pretends to care about women. Jeremy Hunt, how about we base this stuff on evidence and science and keep what you think is best based on no experience out of this?\u201d Theresa May came under pressure to act to equalise Northern Ireland abortion law with the rest of the UK when prime minister. A group of female Tory MPs including Maria Miller, Amber Rudd and Justine Greening told May there was growing support in the party for either a referendum on the issue or an extension of the 1967 act to Northern Ireland. May\u2019s government did not challenge the ban, which is supported by her confidence and supply partners in the Democratic Unionist party (DUP). However, MPs voted last year to force the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, to explain how officials could continue to enforce the ban."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
