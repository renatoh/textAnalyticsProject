The new company has hired as its chairman Goran Ando, the former chief executive of Celltech, a British firm that was taken over by the German drugs firm UCB. Trigen has a blood-thinning drug in mid-stage clinical trials and hopes to start late stage tests early next year. ProCorde has technology that evaluates potential drug targets and has a prospective thrombosis treatment. The merger prompted speculation that the London-based company could float in the next two years. Trigen, formed out of the Thrombosis Research Institute in 1992, has raised \u00a333m from private investors, about two-thirds of it from the Barclay brothers, owners of the Telegraph newspapers and Ritz hotel."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
