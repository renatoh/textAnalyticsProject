Some victories retain a lingering significance and, with Wales in their Rugby World Cup pool next year, this could be one of them. Even if Stuart Lancaster's side fail to nick this year's Six Nations title, they will still have taken a massive stride forwards. Already they have managed what no English side has done since the World Cup winners of 2003 and beat the Welsh, the Irish and the Scots in the same season. But for a couple of wicked bounces of the ball in Paris last month they would be within one win of a grand slam with this weekend's trip to Italy to come. As it is, they now need to defeat the Italians and hope France do them a favour by beating Ireland later the same day. A convenient draw at the Stade de France would be even better. Either way Warren Gatland has received a swift answer to the rhetorical question he posed during the endless pre-match build-up. If England had any boys in their team six weeks ago, they are all men now. Without Leigh Halfpenny's outstanding goal-kicking the defending champions would have come a horribly distant second, if not by quite the same margin as England did in Cardiff a year ago. That 30-3 Millennium Stadium massacre suddenly seems an awfully long time ago. It may be that Gatland and the Welsh management will find this result similarly hard to shake off. There is little point having one of the best back-lines in world rugby if you kick away the majority of your ball and England's pace and intensity visibly discomforted a few of their older forwards. Had Halfpenny not routinely punished every tiny English ruck infringement with three points, the amount of fire breathed by the dragon on this occasion would barely have toasted a crumpet. Was this the day the Welsh Lions' exploits in Australia finally caught up with them? Quite possibly but England were also without the likes of Manu Tuilagi, Tom Croft, Dan Cole, Alex Corbisiero, Geoff Parling, Billy Vunipola and Marland Yarde. Stick them all back in alongside Courtney Lawes, Joe Launchbury, Mike Brown, Danny Care, Luther Burrell and Owen Farrell, all consistently impressive in this championship, and there is the emerging nucleus of a team that could conceivably take on all-comers when the rest of the world come to play in 2015. Lancaster's team have now beaten every Tier One nation in the past two years with the exception of the Springboks, against whom they drew in Port Elizabeth in 2012. With Ben Morgan and Billy Twelvetrees also taking the opportunity to ink themselves into Lancaster's plans \u2013 there was even a debut for George Ford in the closing seconds \u2013 the Twickenham rose garden has not bloomed with such promise in more than a decade. England are even beginning to master the knack of starting well, Care darting over in the fifth minute after his quick tapped penalty caught the Welsh defence fast asleep. Given they had previously gone 277 minutes without scoring a try against their opponents, it further reinforced the sense of a team ready to put the past behind them. Even the French referee, Romain Poite, felt the force of the home team's physicality when Lawes powered straight into him; Wales, caught in a straitjacket of their own tactical making, were reduced to poaching penalties at the breakdown to feed Halfpenny's insatiable kicking habit. Even when they did break clear there was none of the ruthlessness with which Gatland's teams are normally associated in big games. George North needlessly kicked ahead with Dan Lydiate outside him in space, while Brown expertly chopped down Jamie Roberts when the centre did finally find himself in open country. England made far better use of their opportunities, Twelvetrees producing an inch-perfect grubber kick for a diving Burrell to record his third try in four Tests for his country. Farrell, who like Halfpenny did not miss a single kick all day, drilled the conversion to make it 20-9 six minutes before half-time, only for two more avoidable England penalties to be summarily punished by Wales' executioner-in-chief. For perhaps the only time on a day when God Save The Queen and Sweet Chariot were sung at near-record volume the majority of the stadium fell relatively quiet. The 54th-minute sin-binning of Gethin Jenkins for a scrummaging offence too many, gave England's forwards a timely boost, however, and three more penalties from the nerveless Farrell gave them a 29-18 cushion entering the final quarter. On another day it might not have been quite enough but neither the replacement of the below-par Rhys Priestland with Dan Biggar nor the arrival of Mike Phillips made a sizeable difference. Instead it was England who came closest to scoring what would have been a contender for the championship try of the season with six minutes left, Lawes somehow finding the energy to grasp Jack Nowell's nifty pass and release Burrell for another surge to the right corner. Halfpenny's tackle was suicidally brave and, while he did narrowly force Burrell into touch, it came at the expense of a dislocated right shoulder which will rule him out for the rest of the season. Perhaps England should have won by more. Wales, not to mention the southern hemisphere's finest, will still take some knocking over next year. Then again a total of one try conceded in their last three games, all won, suggests a steelier core is developing. When Gatland suggested afterwards that both teams will be stronger by the time the next World Cup comes round, he was certainly correct in England's case. They may not take the title this year \u2013 Ireland with a points difference of plus 49 must still be favourites \u2013 but the Triple Crown will be far from the only silverware claimed during Lancaster's tenure.
