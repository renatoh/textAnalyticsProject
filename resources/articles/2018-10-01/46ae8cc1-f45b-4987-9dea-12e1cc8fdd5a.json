We can only be in the presence of a Sharon Horgan production. Women on the Verge (W), her new six-part series, is actually a co-creation with writer Lorna Martin. Based on Martin\u2019s similarly titled bestselling memoir, it is the tale of three thirtysomething female friends whose lives are not quite turning out as promised. As the creator of the cruelly and absurdly axed Pulling (late twentysomethings in late-twentysomething meltdown), the crashingly brilliant Catastrophe (whose delineation of two late starters negotiating a new relationship after a surprise pregnancy continues in an imminent fourth series) and Motherhood (40+, shit bouncing off the fan in every direction), this is very much Horgan\u2019s scabrously specialist subject. We open with Dublin-based magazine writer Laura (Kerry Condon) having sex and negotiating the parameters of dirty talk (\u201cI\u2019m not saying that!\u201d) up against the sink in a disabled loo with her boss. Coitus is interrupted by a call on his phone. \u201cDidn\u2019t we say \u2026\u201d he murmurs into it, \u201cnot bevelled?\u201d Laura\u2019s face falls as unignorable evidence of an entire and ongoing marital relationship arrives in two syllables. You don\u2019t argue about bevels with anyone but your nearest and dearest. We turn then to a new vagina and the character it belongs to, Katie (Nina Sosanya), who is up in stirrups and about to undergo IVF. \u201cWe do have to get you wide enough,\u201d says the doctor, clacking his speculum. Katie, ultimately, decides not to go through with her plan to furnish Ella, her daughter by her ex-husband, with a sibling. Finally, there is Alison (Eileen Walsh, who played Sharon\u2019s bracingly amoral maid of honour in the first series of Catastrophe), sitting across a cafe table with her ex \u2013 another of the nervously hapless men ruined by the very unhapless women with whom Horgan customarily peppers her productions. He accidentally knocks over a vase. \u201cOh God,\u201d he says, dabbing at the water. \u201cNo wonder you dumped me.\u201d But he discovers, to his delight, that she is here \u2013 after one too many disastrous Tinder dates \u2013 to reverse the break-up. Later on, her friends query her decision. \u201cYou used to fantasise about him dying in an avalanche,\u201d says Laura. \u201cYou used to encourage him to go climbing on his own. Without his phone.\u201d \u201cYou told him ropes were for wimps, remember?\u201d \u201cI was young and idealistic,\u201d Alison explains. \u201cI\u2019ve realised it\u2019s perfectly normal to hate your partner and wish they were dead most of the time.\u201d Over the course of the half hour, Laura \u2013 an emotionally and aurally pulverising friend I would pitch into the Liffey within an hour of meeting (it is not quite clear what either of the other two sees in the exhausting woman) \u2013 tries and fails to break up with her boss and gets effectively demoted at work. Meanwhile, Katie learns that her ex-husband\u2019s new wife is pregnant (\u201cI was just saying how embarrassing it was for me to find out your news through Ella,\u201d she tells him. \u201cThanks!\u201d he says, obliviously \u2013 another perfect encapsulation of an entire, if not ongoing, marriage). The Horgan bones, it is clear, are there \u2013 as indeed is Horgan herself, in a brief closing scene, as the therapist Katie very understandably recommends to Laura over lunch (she re-appears as the contemptuous Dr Fitzgerald in future episodes just often enough to make you long for a whole series to be built round her). The flesh on them is slightly flabby. The sit and the com veer too close too often into Bridget Jones territory \u2013 viewers may long to shake sense into the three protagonists more often than they want to roar in recognition \u2013 and their world isn\u2019t fully realised enough for Women on the Verge to come near challenging Pulling or Catastrophe for their crowns. But as a placeholder while we await the fourth series of the latter, the new one of Motherland (if that floats your boat. I can\u2019t bear it, but that\u2019s possibly because I can\u2019t bear motherhood) and Horgan\u2019s turn as a woman worried about her unstable sister in Aisling Bea\u2019s forthcoming Happy AF, it will do nicely. And if therapy actually works on Laura so I don\u2019t have to drown her before episode three, it will do more nicely still."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
