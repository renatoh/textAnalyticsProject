Wiltord is notorious for not taking a place on the bench lying down and, when the record \u00a313m signing was dropped for the match against Lyon in February, he claimed the decision had \"stuck in his throat\". That was just one of several outbursts since he joined from Bordeaux last August, among the others being: \"I was annoyed and disappointed not to be in the team. I thought I'd have played straight away up front\"; and \"I'm suffering from not being able to express myself and from not playing two games in succession\". They were not comments designed to ingratiate himself with the man who bought him but, now he is scoring goals for fun and giving Wenger the sort of headache managers secretly enjoy, the urbane manager seems quite prepared to let those bygones be bygones. \"I know that patience is not the biggest quality in our society any more but it took him time to settle, because of the language, because it's the first time he left the country, and as well as that I couldn't give him a run because of the competition we have in the team, so it took him longer to adapt. \"But I like the way he plays; he's mobile and he is difficult to mark because he goes everywhere. He has found the right pace and adapted to the English game and he complements everybody.\" Three goals in 33 minutes was more than enough complementary medicine to cure Arsenal of their Manchester United hangover. The first came from a mistake by Stuart Pearce who headed the ball tamely to the feet of Robert Pires; and, when the right-winger put Wiltord through, he buried the ball emphatically. Another mistake from Pearce allowed Wiltord to wriggle free for his second, and then he timed his run perfectly to collect Frederik Ljungberg's pass and slot home his hat-trick goal and his eighth this new year. A weakened West Ham must now regroup for another London derby with Chelsea on Wednesday and their FA Cup quarter-final against Tottenham on Sunday. Paolo di Canio will be back after suspension but there are doubts about the fitness of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9, Joe Cole and Michael Carrick, all absent on Saturday. With Trevor Sinclair and Steve Lomas also injured, the Hammers' manager Harry Redknapp lamented: \"I can't afford to be without six top players, especially against a team like Arsenal. I knew it was all over before half-time.\" It meant a disappointing first return for the former Highbury favourite Nigel Winterburn, wearing the captain's armband and given a standing ovation before the match, but a comfortable comeback after injury for Tony Adams, who was relishing the week ahead which climaxes with a Cup quarter-final against Blackburn or Bolton on Saturday. \"Come next Sunday we could be still in the runners-up place in the Premiership and close to reaching the quarter-finals of the Champions League and the semi-finals of the FA Cup,\" he said in the programme. \"That is not a bad position to be in at the beginning of March.\" Reports of Arsenal's demise have been greatly exaggerated. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
