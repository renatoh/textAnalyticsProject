We may not yet know the full extent of the damage caused by the present financial crisis, but already glimmers of the silver lining within this immense thundercloud of bad news are beginning to present themselves, if only you will screw up your eyes and look for them. You may think, for example, that in these straitened times luxury is a luxury we can no longer afford, but this is not true. Thanks to recent sharp rises in rent and utilities bills, for many people it is actually cheaper to move out of their flats and live in a hotel. How glamorous is that? According to a press release issued by the Intercontinental Hotels Group, couples whose rent exceeds \u00a3727 a month might well be better off booking a room, thereby saving on gas and electric, internet, BT landline rental, cleaning, council tax and TV licence, to the tune of \u00a3219 a month. In this case, the hotel used for comparison was the Holiday Express Stafford, which only has 103 rooms, so it is not a long-term solution for everybody, not even for everybody in Stafford. Nevertheless it's a fine example of accentuating the positive from a hotel group whose share price dropped 22% in just a month. Good work. Remember: the only thing we have to fear is fear, in this case the fear of being reduced to bartering for food in a perpetual economic dark age. So stop fretting over the return of prosperity, and start worrying about things that are going to happen in your lifetime. Recession-busting tip: when you live in a budget hotel, breakfast is the most important meal of the day in more ways than one. Don't be afraid to ask them to put out more croissants. And don't make any phone calls.
