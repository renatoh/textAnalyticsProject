The injury-prone Liverpool striker chipped an exquisite finish over Bayern goalkeeper Sven Ulreich in the 83rd minute of the Audi Cup game at the Allianz Arena. In doing so Sturridge, a 67th minute substitute for J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team, sustained a thigh injury that forced his own substitution with four minutes remaining. The England international will have further tests before the full extent of the problem and any lay-off is known. \u201cI can\u2019t say [the extent] but he hurt his thigh,\u201d said Klopp after the win that set up a final against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on Wednesday. \u201cHe has prepared really well and I just hope it\u2019s only a small injury and he can play again soon. His goal was really great and he had another chance before that. You could see how fast he is. It is a shame and I just hope it is nothing serious.\u201d Sturridge later downplayed the injury, insisting he \u201cwill be OK\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s just a bit of fatigue. I\u2019m feeling the best I\u2019ve felt for a while,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to the season and hopefully we can have some success this season as well.\u201d Any time on the sidelines would represent a significant setback to Sturridge who, despite doubts over his long-term Liverpool future at the end of last season, has impressed Klopp this summer with his fitness and application. The striker had spoken only recently about his sharpness after being sidelined by a hip injury last season and losing his starting role in the Liverpool team behind Sadio Man\u00e9, Roberto Firmino and Philippe Coutinho. The competition for forward places in Klopp\u2019s side has intensified following the club record signing of Mohamed Salah from Roma this summer, and Liverpool\u2019s attacking prowess was evident as they beat Bayern comfortably at the Allianz Arena. Man\u00e9, who is working his way back to full fitness having undergone knee surgery in April, opened the scoring against Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s team and was instrumental in Liverpool\u2019s second, a close-range header from Salah. Bayern enjoyed plenty of possession but could not cope with their opponents\u2019 pace and penetration on the counter attack. The Bundesliga champions face their first competitive match of the season on Saturday \u2013 the German Supercup Final against Klopp\u2019s old club Borussia Dortmund \u2013 and their preparations have been far from ideal. Bayern have lost to Arsenal, Milan, Internazionale and now Liverpool in pre-season. Robert Lewandowski\u2019s obvious displeasure at the poor quality service he received and an anonymous display from summer recruit James Rodriguez, stationed wide on the right, showed Ancelotti has several problems to address ahead of the new season. Not that Klopp got carried away with Liverpool\u2019s most impressive result of the summer so far. \u201cNearly everything was good but we are still in our preparations, we haven\u2019t played enough football so far, and Bayern enjoyed too much possession tonight,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cWe gave the ball to Bayern too much and we had to run around too much but at times my team showed how good they can play football. The third goal was great. In attack we were really good. In the first half we were very dangerous on the counter, the pressing was very good.\u201d Out-of-favour Alberto Moreno, who has been linked with a move away from Liverpool this summer, produced a productive display at left back. Klopp suggested the Spanish defender would have a future at Anfield if he displayed that form on a more consistent basis. Klopp said: \u201cHe would play if he played like he did today, yes. It was a really good game by Alberto. Every second he was playing better, that\u2019s why we kept playing him. He looked really fit although he had a little problem with his thigh but we had a test with him this morning and he was OK. The players decide themselves how many games they play.\u201d In the other Audi Cup semi-final Atl\u00e9tico came from a goal behind to beat Napoli 2-1 thanks to strikes from Fernando Torres and Luciano Vietto. Diego Simeone\u2019s team also had Diego God\u00edn sent off for two bookable offences, the second of which sparked furious exchanges between the opposing benches. \u201cI hope things will calm down for tomorrow as we want to play a bit,\u201d said Klopp."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
