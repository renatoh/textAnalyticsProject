The 32-year-old has NRL championships, multiple State of Origin successes with Queensland, three Golden Boots for being the best player in the world and a World Cup triumph with Australia in 2013 to his name \u2013 but there is something missing for the North Queensland captain. Thurston is one of the sport\u2019s most likeable characters \u2013 the way he conducts himself off the field is parallel to the way he acts on it \u2013 but he is not here this week to make friends: he is here to win the one trophy that has eluded him. English fans have been treated to rare glimpses of Thurston\u2019s talents in an Australia shirt, but on Sunday he will play club rugby in this country for the first time, leading the Cowboys in their pursuit of a first World Club Challenge title as they take on the Super League champions, Leeds. The tournament has been considered somewhat of a pre-season friendly for some NRL clubs in the past, but the perception of the competition has changed in Australia. \u201cI have prioritised this game, without doubt,\u201d Thurston says. \u201cIt was a tough decision to pull out of the NRL All Stars game [which took place last week]; I\u2019m very proud of my heritage and indigenous culture so it was difficult, but this was a box I really wanted to tick and I\u2019ll give myself every opportunity of doing that by preparing with the boys. \u201cThis is our first time over here as a club, but we\u2019ve come out pretty early to acclimatise, prepare and give ourselves every chance of winning. We\u2019re taking it seriously. It would rank right up there with winning the Premiership if we do win: to be called the best team in the world has a nice ring to it.\u201d While North Queensland have the same side that won last year\u2019s Grand Final, Leeds\u2019 preparations have been far from ideal. Not only have they lost their opening two Super League games \u2013 including a 56-12 humbling by Widnes that left them bottom of the table \u2013 but they are without some of their biggest names due to injury, including the captain, Danny McGuire, as they chase a record fourth world title. There is also the considerable loss of Jamie Peacock, Kylie Leului and Kevin Sinfield from their treble-winning team of 2015. Yet Thurston is still expecting a stern test at Headingley. He says: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be reading too much into the way they\u2019ve started their season. They are a quality club so we\u2019re here to prepare as best we can, because we\u2019ll need to. We\u2019re not going to take them lightly. Whoever they put out on the field will do a great job for them. They\u2019re a great club with great players.\u201d The half-back pairings offer the best example of the differing preparations of the sides. Thurston will line up alongside Michael Morgan, the man whose back-of-the-hand pass in the NRL Grand Final created the Kyle Feldt try that took the game to extra time. Meanwhile, Leeds will field Liam Sutcliffe (21) and Jordan Lilley (19). Thurston knows little about the pair. \u201cI\u2019ve heard they\u2019re pretty young and inexperienced, but in saying that they\u2019ve got Rob Burrow who\u2019s very experienced and he\u2019ll get the boys around the park. He\u2019s very sharp out of dummy-half or whatever position he plays.\u201d As they look to start 2016 in a similar way to how 2015 finished, Thurston says the game is an important step for his emerging Cowboys side to take. \u201cWe haven\u2019t spoken about creating a dynasty but like every other club in any competition we want to be in the big games,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe\u2019re coming up against a real tough outfit in Leeds who have been successful for many years, so we\u2019re looking forward to the challenge.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
