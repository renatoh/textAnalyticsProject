It is a statement more than a question. The celebrated winner of 10 Tour de France stages has come to expect bad press, his defence mechanisms ready at the slightest sign of trouble. Actually his assumption is wrong. He is too personable ever to be described as an \"arsehole\". True, he is outspoken, but the overriding impression of Cavendish is not arrogant and brutish, rather mischievous and boyish, a young buck who enjoys running off his mouth. Attracting his agent's attention, he then delivers his most outrageous lines, eyes sparkling, as he lolls on the sofa of a central London hotel. We are discussing last year's critical decision in the Tour de France, when his 13th place finish was revoked. He was stripped of his stage points and placed last after the 24-year-old was judged to have driven his rival Thor Hushovd \u2013 and eventual winner of the green jersey as the overall points leader \u2013 too close to the barriers. \"The decision last year, that's got to be one of the worst sports decisions in history \u2013 it's up there with Maradona's handball at the [1986] World Cup. Don't you think? One of the worst decisions in sports history. Really. That was \u2026\" He looks at his agent. \"Can I use your term? Let me use your term!\" he says, wriggling in his seat and repeating an obscenity about the commissar of the Tour de France. Cavendish laughs his head off. It is a joke, and it is not a joke. The Manxman is convinced that the disqualification that cost him the green jersey was personal \u2013 a persecutory theme that appears to run through his life. As he says: \"I've had everybody telling me I was shit since I was a kid so I've always had to stick up for myself.\" In the case of the Tour de France, he claims his unbridled success has ruffled some feathers. \"Because I was winning so comfortably,\" he claims, \"and the way I was celebrating; I was doing wacky salutes and that crossing the finish line. Maybe he just thought \u2026 I don't know. You know what I mean? One of them.\" He casts a knowing look. When it comes to trouble Cavendish insists he is not an agent provocateur. \"I don't ever start shit, I just retaliate a lot, and that's just sticking up for myself.\" At times it's hard to know how serious he is about the criticisms he makes, how much is genuine complaint and how much is banter. Of a recent alleged spat between Cavendish and an HTC-Columbia team-mate, Andr\u00e9 Greipel, he reveals his hand when he says: \"Loads of stuff I said about Andr\u00e9 is with a little smirk. It's like knowing it's creating controversy, if you know what I mean?\" He recreates the smirk and looks across to his agent mischievously: \"Can I say that?\" But there are subjects that genuinely ignite his temper, and he flares up at the mention of his Great Britain team-mate and sometime friend Bradley Wiggins. Asked if Cavendish might one day join Team Sky \u2013 a topic that has provoked excited reports since the team's inception \u2013 Wiggins reportedly suggested that his rival may not be suited to a team atmosphere unlike at HTC-Columbia where, he claimed, the team is built around Cavendish. The subject incenses him to the point where he bangs the table, sending the Dictaphone jogging all over the place, and a series of disconnected observations follows. \"It's not built around me. Cycling is a commercial sport where the job \u2013 what's he on about? That's like saying ... It's not a pub crawl, cycling's a job where fundamentally we have sponsors who pay for the team. Our job is to display those sponsors as prominently as possible, we're moving billboards, and what better way to display those sponsors than to cross the finish line with your hands in the air? That's why Bradley's not winning. Did he actually say that? Or not? It's not eight people helping me win \u2026 I'm riding for the team. Bradley doesn't see that.\" As he speaks there is the slightest of lisps, the consequence of braces recently having been fitted to his teeth. These were, ostensibly, the cause of a difficult start to his season \u2013 unable to defend the Milan-San Remo title \u2013 as tooth extractions from his lower jaw subsequently became infected and rendered him bed-bound. \"The sides of my mouth swelled up like grapes and my lower palate was massive,\" he says. \"I was vomiting and got diarrhoea, my doctor said he'd never seen anything like it. I couldn't train, I was like somebody in hospital, lying on a bed for two and a half weeks, you lose all your muscle and all your fitness. It was depressing, actually.\" The orthodontic work has caused some complications with his spine but, having won a stage on the Tour of Catalunya last month, Cavendish says he feels as ready as ever to race for the green jersey on Le Tour this year and win it. His confidence, he says, is based on logic. \"I know if I do the work then I'll win it. I'm not being arrogant, I'm sat here with pretty slumped shoulders, stating the fact that I know I'll do what's right to win it. I know physically no one can match me. We've got the best guys on the team to support me to do it. It's illogical to say I shouldn't be the favourite for it.\" Doesn't he ever worry that things might go wrong? \"No, I won't let it. Lance Armstrong won seven Tours, that's 147 days of racing, and he never had a puncture or a mechanical. You can really minimise your chances of a mistake if you do everything right,\" he says, embarking on an analogy of his own meticulous race preparations. \"One guy said I had OCD [obsessive compulsive disorder], but I'm just meticulous. It's like when I'm cooking I cut everything up, prepare it all in bowls \u2013 you know like how they do in TV? Well that's minimising the risk of failure, I'm not going to burn something because I'm cutting something up. If you can put all your ingredients in bowls beforehand you're not going to fuck up. That's what I'm like when I'm competing.\" And when he's not competing? He smiles broadly. A rare trip back to the Isle of Man has reinvigorated him, a night on the island's tiles reminding him of home. \"I had such a good time,\" he says fondly. \"It's the first time in a long time that I felt like a person, you know? Not a product.\" That is one thing we never have to worry Cavendish will become. Alongside his talent, his individuality is his most appealing quality. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 April 2010. The original said that Mark Cavendish's 2009 win on the 14th stage of the Tour de France was revoked on a technicality.
