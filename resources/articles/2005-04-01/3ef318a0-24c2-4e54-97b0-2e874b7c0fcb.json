It is as certain as anything can be that there was a nervous and excited end-of-term mood among ministers yesterday when Tony Blair finally confirmed the worst-kept political secret of the year - that there will be a general election on Thursday May 5. But it is just as certain that the mood of eagerness for the coming fray will have mingled with some genuine gut-tighten ing buttock-clenching fear, as ministers pored over a clutch of new polls showing Labour's lead narrowing. As they prepared to leave their familiar Whitehall bubble behind only the bravest will not have wondered whether they will see their ministerial offices again. Sometimes that sort of fear is absurd. There was no evidence whatsoever to support the famous \"wobbly Thursday\" panic in the Thatcher high command seven days before polling day in 1987; a week later the Tories predictably trounced Labour with a majority of 102. This time, though, Britain is embarking on the first election since 1992 in which the result is genuinely in doubt. Thirteen years ago the uncertainty had an apparently solid foundation: the opinion polls were neck-and-neck between the Tories and Labour at the start of the campaign and remained so to the end - even the election night exit polls predicted a hung parliament. In 2005 the uncertainty is altogether harder to pin down, though it is every bit as potent. This time the polls mostly put Labour ahead - the three-point lead identified by this week's latest Guardian/ ICM survey is in line with most of the other surveys of recent days. This time it is not just the way that the public intends to vote that is the big question, as whether it intends to vote at all. The media, of course, love a contest rather than a walkover, especially after 2001, and will play that element up. Nevertheless, there is a real sense, and not just in the Westminster village, that many voters are undecided about their voting intention or are not committed to that intention. That has fed the suspicion that all is not as the pollsters claim - and that therefore this could be the most unpredictable and exciting contest for years. There are several serious reasons why this election is hard to call. The main one is the apparent unravelling of Tony Blair's national popularity, mainly because of the Iraq war, and the consequent disassembling of his big tent coalition that swept all before it in the past two elections. The means, first, that the tactical voting against the Tories that marked the 1997 and 2001 contests may unwind. Labour voters in seats that Labour cannot win are likely to remain happy voting for (mainly) Liberal Democrats; Blair's unpopularity may even give this process a boost. But Lib Dem and other third-party voters may be less inclined to return the favour where Labour is strong. That could let the Tories back into the game in a lot of seats they lost in 1997 and 2001. The second consequence could be a pronounced swing against Labour in seats where the war remains a particular touchstone - seats with significant Muslim electorates, for example, or seats containing a lot of students. A third factor could be the disaffection of the Labour core vote, though this is sometimes exaggerated. Nevertheless, extensive disgruntlement in the Labour heartlands (and elsewhere) could result in reduced turnout, protest voting for parties of the extreme right (or possibly the left) and a general volatility that could have unpredictable results, perhaps rewarding effective single-issue campaigns such as the \"Save Kidderminster Hospital\" campaign that ousted Labour in favour of an independent in 2001. Regions Britain's regions rarely respond uniformly in elections, and if several of these factors impact together, there could be dramatic differences in different parts of the country. The north-east and Wales swung against more heavily against Labour in 2001 than the south-west and the south-east. That could suggest that the latter regions will be more difficult for Labour this time, or it may imply that opposition parties will be most likely to make gains in areas where Labour has been weakened. There could be a similarly uneven pattern in urban Britain, too. Labour's success in 1997 and 2001 has been followed by widespread opposition successes in local government elections. The Lib Dems think they are in with a good shout in Newcastle and perhaps Sheffield and Birmingham. The Tories hope to make inroads in Edinburgh and Bristol. But it is London - where Ken Livingstone's mayoral re-election may mask a wider slump in Labour fortunes - where the contest will be the fiercest and changes possibly the largest. If the polls are right, however, Labour may do far better than the on-the-ground experts suspect. Even when the result of an election is heavily odds-on, as it was for Thatcher in 1987, the capacity of likely winners to panic - as the Tories did on the famous \"wobbly Thursday\" - should never be ignored. But it is all to play for now. \"Cabinet that morning was abuzz,\" recalled John Major of March 11 1992, when he called a general election he would eventually win by a majority of 21. \"Everyone present believed we could win, but not everyone thought we would. Looking around the cabinet table, I could see some ministers wondering if they would sit around it again.\" Even Major himself was not immune from doubt. Sitting in the Queen's study in Buckingham Palace while he sought the formal dissolution, a royal corgi settled with its nose on the prime ministerial foot. \"As I idly stroked the back of his neck, I wondered if Neil Kinnock liked dogs,\" Major wrote in his memoirs. Not even Blair's greatest enemy can accuse him of taking the voters for granted. So when Blair had his own dissolution audience with the Queen yesterday, it is a fair bet that he too may have wondered how Michael Howard would get on with the corgis."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
