The Democrat does not move into the White House for another 75 days, but the economic crisis puts him under intense pressure to provide reassurances to Americans worried about their economic future. The best way for Obama to provide such measure of calm was to begin revealing his team, Democratic operatives said today. Obama is looking to calm markets by appointing an emergency economic committee with household names - possibly including the billionaire investor, Warren Buffett, whose name Obama has brandished in the presidential debates against John McCain. There were signs that the new faces of the next administration could emerge as early as tomorrow when the president-elect is expected to make a formal announcements about his chief of staff. Others, such as treasury secretary, defence secretary and secretary of state, are expected over the next week or two. Democratic officials said today that Obama had offered the job to Rahm Emanuel, a Chicago congressman admired for his political instincts and feared for his temper. The choice of Emanuel would send a message through Washington political circles that Obama intends to put his own stamp on his administration, rather than resort to familiar figures who had served under Bill Clinton or Jimmy Carter. The president-elect is also expected to make good on his promise to end partisan division in Washington by naming Republicans to key posts. There was widespread anticipation today that Obama would ask the Pentagon chief, Robert Gates, to stay on. However, that too could be subject to negotiation with Gates expected to demand his choice of under-secretaries of defence. And it is widely expected that there will be an expanded role for Joe Biden, the vice-president elect. Biden told the New Yorker last month that he agreed to the job only on condition that he be widely involved in the next administration - and not confined to a single area of policy. Biden said he told Obama: \"I don't want to be a vice-president who is not part of the major decisions you make.\" Obama chose Biden in August not because he expected him to be a skilled campaigner but with an eye to office, seeing the veteran senator as someone who knows how to get legislation through Congress. Obama had consulted widely while preparing his run for the White House, and had regularly met with senior figures from the Clinton era and other fixtures in Washington. He said before the election he already has in mind who he will appoint. He chose John Podesta, Bill Clinton's former chief of staff, to oversee the transition, trusting the whippet-thin and cerebral former chief of staff to Clinton to identify the key jobs that need filling in the next administration. But while ready to work with Washington insiders, Obama is unlikely to confine himself to that relatively limited talent pool when it comes to recruiting members of his cabinet and key aides. It would also be at odds with his message of change if Obama were to rely too heavily on familiar figures from the Clinton administration. The president-elect is seeking experience, and knowledge of the way Washington works, but he will be leery of taking on the partisan baggage and infighting of the 1990s that comes with Clinton veterans. ABC reported today that Obama wanted smart, capable people who would also \"have his back\". In his nearly two-year run for the White House, Obama has gathered his own trusted team - some of whom could now be headed for Washington. Top of that list is Obama's chief strategist, David Axelrod, a Chicago political consultant managing his first presidential campaign. In the early days of the campaign, Axelrod had said no when asked if he would ever consider a job in an Obama administration; by the end, there were signs the denials were softening. There will also likely be a place in an Obama administration for David Plouffe, who built the grass roots network that helped clinch the campaign. Obama thanked both men in his victory speech last night. Obama owes an equally large debt to Penny Pritzker, an heiress to the Hyatt hotel chain, who helped him make crucial connections among Chicago's wealthy liberals and who built his legendary fundraising machine. There have even been suggestions of a post for Caroline Kennedy, whose support in January helped turn Obama from political outsider to heir apparent to America's most fabled political clan. Kennedy took on an even more important role in Obama's campaign last June when she became a member of his vice-presidential search committee. Who's may be who in the Obama administration White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, a Congressman from Obama's home state Illinois, is reported to have been offered the job. Tom Daschle, the former Democratic leader in the senate, was also on the shortlist. Treasury secretary Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, Bill Clinton's Treasury secretary, Larry Summers, and Tim Geithner, chairman of the Federal Reserve of New York. Others include Obama's adviser and University of Chicago economist Austan Goolsbee and the financier Warren Buffet. Secretary of State The veteran diplomat Richard Holbrooke, Bush's former secretary of state Colin Powell, the failed Democratic presidential candidate in 2004, John Kerry, and Chuck Hagel, the retiring Republican senator. National Security adviser Obama's foreign affairs advisers Tony Lake and Susan Rice. Defence Obama may be tempted to keep Bush's appointee Robert Gates, respected by both Republicans and Democrats, in place, or put in Richard Danzig, the former Navy secretary. \u2022 This article was amended on Thursday November 6 2008.
