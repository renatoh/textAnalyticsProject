I have a landline connection at my address, but no landline provider having cancelled BT years ago when I started to use a mobile. Whenever I enquire about broadband I am always told I need a BT line. Does that mean I must pay BT for line rental as well as a fee to an internet service provider (ISP), or would the ISP fee cover the line rental as well? So much to learn, so little time! GC A Well at least you're making the effort! It all depends on where you live. Local loop unbundling is the process whereby BT makes its local network cables, which connect individual customer's homes to the local exchange, available to other suppliers of telecoms services. These other companies can then upgrade individual customers' lines in order to offer various telecoms services, such as broadband. In these circumstances, you wouldn't need to pay a separate fee to BT - the cost of renting the phone line would be included in the fee paid to your ISP. It's just the physical presence of the BT line that is necessary. Alternatively, if you live in an area serviced by either NTL or Telewest you can get broadband services without needing a BT line at all, as cable broadband services don't operate on existing BT lines, they have their own network.
