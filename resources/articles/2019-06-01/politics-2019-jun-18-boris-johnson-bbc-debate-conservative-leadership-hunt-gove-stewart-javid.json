The former foreign secretary remains overwhelming favourite to be Britain\u2019s next prime minister after winning the second round of voting among Conservative MPs convincingly, with 126 votes of the 313 cast. But in his first appearance in a televised debate during the contest, having spurned Sunday\u2019s Channel 4 event, cracks appeared in some of his positions under scrutiny from viewers\u2019 questions and his rivals\u2019 replies during the BBC programme. Asked by Abdullah, an imam from Bristol, whether he accepted that \u201cwords have consequences\u201d, Johnson claimed his comments \u2013 such as comparing Muslim women in burqas to \u201cletterboxes\u201d \u2013 were sometimes taken out of context. And he referred to his Muslim great-grandfather, who he said came to Britain because it was \u201ca beacon of generosity and openness\u201d. He went on to insist that his mistaken remark that the imprisoned British-Iranian citizen Nazanin Zhagari-Ratcliffe was teaching in Iran \u201cdidn\u2019t make any difference\u201d. Johnson also appeared to wobble over his pledge of a tax cut for high earners, saying: \u201cWhat we would bring forward is a package to help primarily the poorest people in society,\u201d \u2013 but that he thought it was right to have an \u201cambition\u201d to raise the higher rate. The debate, presented by Emily Maitlis, was repeatedly characterised by interruptions. Michael Gove condemned Johnson\u2019s plan to increase the threshold at which the 40p income tax rate is levied, from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000. \u201cI think that is wrong,\u201d Gove said. One of the most notable moments came when all five candidates were given a scathing review by a 15-year-old climate striker named Erin, who asked them to commit to net zero carbon emissions by 2025. None agreed to do so and, asked for her reflections afterwards, Erin said none had \u201creally impressed\u201d her. \u201cClimate change isn\u2019t an issue of tomorrow, it\u2019s an issue of today and we need to create drastic, critical action and I don\u2019t think any of you are willing to offer that,\u201d she told them. Addressing her question on the environment, Johnson said he continued to have \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about Heathrow expansion, but would not say whether he would block it as prime minister. He was also pressed by the other four contenders remaining in the race, after former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab was knocked out in the vote earlier. As they answered a viewer\u2019s question about the risks of a no-deal Brexit, Hunt challenged Johnson, saying: \u201cLet me ask Boris a question: what would you say to a sheep farmer in Shropshire that I met whose business would be destroyed by 40% tariffs?\u2026He would say, you got your dream of getting into No 10, but what about my dream to have a family business?\u201d Asked about hitting the 31 October deadline, one of the central promises that has won over many of the most ardent Brexiters to supporting Johnson, he said it was \u201ceminently feasible\u201d. And he stressed the importance of preparing for no deal, in order to secure a better deal. Johnson also gave few details about how he plans to resolve the challenge of preventing a hard border in Northern Ireland, saying he believed the details should be worked out in the transition period after the UK has left. Challenged on why the EU27 would agree to that idea, he pointed to the \u201csolvent\u201d of withholding the \u00a339bn exit payment. Rory Stewart continued his effort to distinguish himself from the other candidates, insisting that now was the wrong time for the Tories to be promising tax cuts. \u201cI\u2019m going to be very straight with people: I don\u2019t think this is the right time to be cutting taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cOur country is suffering huge pressures on public services.\u201d Stewart only joined the cabinet in May, and began the contest as the underdog \u2013 but received 37 votes on Tuesday, after picking up many of those MPs who backed the health secretary, Matt Hancock, in last week\u2019s first round of voting. Gove, who came third with 41, presented himself as the most convincing Brexiter, saying he was the first on the five-man panel to advocate leaving the EU, and \u201cbecause I started this, I will finish it\u201d. Sajid Javid, who only just scraped the 33 votes necessary to stay in the contest for another 24 hours, is likely to come under pressure to fold his campaign. But a spokesman for the home secretary insisted: \u201cHe\u2019s had a great four days, picked up some votes today, and we\u2019ll fight on.\u201d And Javid scored one of the few clear victories during the debate, when he asked his four rivals whether they would all agree to commission an independent review of Islamophobia in the Conservative party, to which they all said yes. But Abdullah later tweeted expressing his disappointment with the Tory hopefuls\u2019 \u201cdeluded\u201d responses to his question about Islamophobia. He said: \u201cWhat I got as a response was nothing short of disappointing and deluded: Boris Johnson forgot my name, spoke about his great-grandfather and about Iran. Gove used the opportunity to have a dig at Jeremy Corbyn. Jeremy Hunt used it as a chance to say he can\u2019t be racist because he has an immigrant wife and Rory Stewart forgot that this is also our country.\u201d He said Javid winning the concession over the review was \u201cthe only positive from the debate\u201d. Hancock withdrew from the leadership race on Friday, and on Sunday threw his weight behind Johnson, who now appears highly likely to be installed in 10 Downing Street by the end of July. But many of the moderate Tories who had rallied behind Stewart remain deeply sceptical about whether Johnson will stick to the one-nation values he has stressed during his leadership pitch, once installed in Downing Street. Hunt\u2019s team had earlier rejected rumours circulating in Westminster that Johnson\u2019s outriders had been urging colleagues to lend their votes to Hunt because he was their preferred opponent. Johnson has the former defence secretary Gavin Williamson and the former Tory party chair Grant Shapps working Westminster on his behalf. He has won over hard Brexiters by promising to take Britain out of the EU by 31 October \u201cwith or without a deal\u201d, but has also played up his one-nation credentials to appeal to his party\u2019s liberal wing. MPs will vote again on Wednesday, and if necessary on Thursday, until the field is narrowed down to just two names, which will then be offered to Conservative members in a postal ballot. The result will be announced in the week beginning 22 July. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 June 2019 to correct the spelling of Grant Shapps\u2019s last name."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
