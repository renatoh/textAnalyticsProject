The Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC) is one of the last remaining courses where students must still sit exams in person, as regulators insist they are needed to uphold the \u201chigh standards and integrity\u201d of the degree. But students say that the Bar Standards Board (BSB), which regulates the exams, must prioritise student wellbeing during the unprecedented global pandemic. In an open letter, signed by 200 BPTC trainees, they urge the BSB to rethink its stance. \u201cIn an extraordinary time of a global pandemic [...] It is essential that the BSB considers [the] human impact, and [...] make adjustments to the format of the exams,\u201d they said. Universities across the country, including Oxford and Cambridge, have already said they will replace traditional undergraduate exams with online assessments. At Imperial College London medical students have also taken unsupervised exams at home for the first time. If the pandemic has not eased by August, sitting exams in person could put students \u2013 particularly those with underlying health conditions \u2013 at risk. International students who have left the UK may also be unable to sit exams in August, students say, and it could make it difficult for others to begin their pupillage and effectively start their careers. Alex Mullen, a law student at BPP University Law School, says it would be a financial struggle for him to sit face-to-face exams in August. \u201cI have a scholarship designed to pay for my course and the costs of living until the end of the course, which is now longer than when they thought it would be. My tenancy also ends in August, so I could have to find somewhere to live for two weeks in the middle of what is going to be a really stressful exam season,\u201d he says. Robert Harris, a student at City Law school, says the situation is tense. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to overplay our concerns and we recognise this is a difficult time for everyone and others have it worse, but still these are real concerns. For me, the key impact is on when I\u2019ll be able to start my pupillage. It seems strange that the Bar course is the only one to say [moving assessments online is] not possible.\u201d The BSB says it is exploring a range of contingency plans if restrictions remain in place in August. \u201cWe are very conscious that this is a difficult and uncertain time for students,\u201d it said in a comment. \u201cHowever, there is no secure solution that could be put in place by April to enable us to deliver these exams as normal. The next scheduled opportunity is August and that is what we are working toward.\u201d However, the Bar Council says it sees \u201cno reason\u201d why exams must be face-to-face in August and that it is \u201cconcerned\u201d that this is \u201cnot the best solution\u201d. \u201cIt creates delay and uncertainty for students. It means students will be sitting exams long after their teaching has finished, and very close to the time when their pupillages would start. And it is unclear how resits can be accommodated,\u201d Nicholas Vineall QC, Chair of the Bar Council\u2019s education and training committee, says. \u201cIt ought to be possible to arrange for these exams to be taken online.\u201d Elsewhere in the legal profession, the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) rowed back on plans to delay exams until the Autumn, after students urged the regulator to rethink. They have since asked universities to send proposals on how they would like to do exams instead. \u201cThey haven\u2019t said what online things must be used, they\u2019re just saying \u2018tell us what you want to do and we\u2019ll consider it\u2019,\u201d Charlotte Parkinson, Chair of the Junior Lawyers Division of the Law Society, says. Legal education is often traditional and slow to adopt online practices. However, individual lecturers are working hard to set up online learning and assessments, similarly to academics teaching other subjects. Alan East, an assistant professor at Coventry Law School, says the pandemic has meant exams have gone online at Coventry. He has also connected with students over Zoom and Microsoft Teams. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to push this over the past couple of years and it has been quite slow but I think this period of being confined to our houses and having to do things online will move things along a bit,\u201d he says. \u201cLaw has begun to modernise.\u201d Students say regulators must be creative and find modern solutions, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
