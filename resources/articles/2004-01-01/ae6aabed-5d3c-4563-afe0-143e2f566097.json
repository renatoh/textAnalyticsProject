The purpose of my statement today is to seek to state, in brief summary, the contents of my report, which contains 328 pages plus appendices, and to state the conclusions to which I have come. Prior to the publication of the report I did not publish on the Inquiry website the final written submissions and comments of the parties submitted to the Inquiry after the final oral statements by counsel for the parties for the reason set out in a statement which I issued on 7 January. The reason was that the parties objected to publication of the final written submissions before publication of the report because it would encourage the trial of various individuals (against whom no criticism might be made in the report) by the media and this would be unfair. Having considered this objection I decided that the final written submissions should not be published pending the publication of the report. However, now that the report is about to be published I have decided, and have informed the parties, that the parties' final written submissions and comments to the Inquiry should be published on the website, and they will begin to be put on the website today. My terms of reference were: \"urgently to conduct an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Dr Kelly.\" In paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 I state my opinion as to what my terms of reference require me to consider and I say: \"these terms of reference required me to consider the circumstances preceding and leading up to the death of Dr Kelly insofar as (1) they might have had an effect on his state of mind and influenced his actions preceding and leading up to his death or (2) they might have influenced the actions of others which affected Dr Kelly preceding and leading up to his death. There has been a great deal of controversy and debate whether the intelligence in relation to weapons of mass destruction set out in the dossier published by the Government on 24 September 2002 was of sufficient strength and reliability to justify the Government in deciding that Iraq under Saddam Hussein posed such a threat to the safety and interests of the United Kingdom that military action should be taken against that country. This controversy and debate has continued because of the failure, up to the time of writing this report, to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. I gave careful consideration to the view expressed by a number of public figures and commentators that my terms of reference required or, at least, entitled me to consider this issue. However I concluded that a question of such wide import, which would involve the consideration of a wide range of evidence, is not one which falls within my terms of reference. The major controversy which arose following Mr Andrew Gilligan's broadcasts on the BBC Today programme on 29 May 2003 and which closely involved Dr Kelly arose from the allegations in the broadcasts (1) that the Government probably knew, before it decided to put it in its dossier of 24 September 2002, that the statement was wrong that the Iraqi military were able to deploy weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes of a decision to do so and (2) that 10 Downing Street ordered the dossier to be sexed up. It was these allegations attacking the integrity of the Government which drew Dr Kelly into the controversy about the broadcasts and which I consider I should examine under my terms of reference. The issue whether, if approved by the Joint Intelligence Committee and believed by the Government to be reliable, the intelligence contained in the dossier was nevertheless unreliable, is a separate issue which I consider does not fall within my terms of reference.\" I also state in paragraphs 10 and 11: \"I further consider that one of my primary duties in carrying out my terms of reference is, after hearing the evidence of many witnesses, to state in considerable detail the relevant facts surrounding Dr Kelly's death and also, insofar as I can determine them, the motives and reasons operating in the minds of those who took various decisions and carried out various actions which affected Dr Kelly.\" \"In order to enable the public to be as fully informed as possible I have also decided, rather than set out a summary of the evidence, to set out in this report many parts of the transcript of the evidence so that the public can read what the witnesses said and can understand why I have come to the conclusions which I state.\" Before setting out the relevant facts I say: \"At the outset I state, for reasons which I will set out in greater detail in a later part of this report, that I am satisfied that Dr Kelly took his own life by cutting his left wrist and that his death was hastened by his taking Coproxamol tablets. I am further satisfied that there was no involvement by a third person in Dr Kelly's death.\" \"I also consider it to be important to state in this early part of the report that I am satisfied that none of the persons whose decisions and actions I later describe ever contemplated that Dr Kelly might take his own life. I am further satisfied that none of those persons was at fault in not contemplating that Dr Kelly might take his own life. Whatever pressures and strains Dr Kelly was subjected to by the decisions and actions taken in the weeks before his death, I am satisfied that no one realised or should have realised that those pressures and strains might drive him to take his own life or to contribute to his decision to do so.\" I then set out in some detail the relevant events which preceded the summer of last year and the events which took place during that summer before Dr Kelly's death. In that summary of facts I describe Dr Kelly's distinguished career as a Government scientist and I say: \"In 1991 Dr Kelly became one of the chief weapons inspectors in Iraq on behalf of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) and from 1991 onwards was deeply involved in investigating the biological warfare programme of the Iraqi regime. These investigations resulted in 1995 in UNSCOM making a breakthrough and forcing the Iraqi regime to admit that it did have a biological warfare programme. During the 1990s Dr Kelly built up a high reputation as a weapons inspector, not only in the United Kingdom but internationally, and he was described in evidence by the journalist and author, Mr Tom Mangold, who knew him well, as the \"inspector's inspector\". The contribution made by Dr Kelly and the importance of his work was recognised by the Government and in 1996 he was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (C.M.G.), the material part of the citation for the award stating: ... he devised the scientific basis for the enhanced biological warfare defence programme and led strong research groups in many key areas. Following the Gulf War he led the first biological warfare inspection in Iraq and has spent most of his time since, either in Iraq or at various sites in the former Soviet Union helping to shed light on past biological warfare related activities and assisting the UK/US RUS trilateral confidence building process. He has pursued this work tirelessly and with good humour despite the significant hardship, hostility and personal risk encountered during extended periods of service in both countries. In 1991 he was appointed adviser to the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM). His efforts in his specialist field have had consequences of international significance.\" \"It appears that in May 2003 Dr Kelly was being considered for a further award (which might well have been a knighthood as he had already been awarded the C.M.G.) because a minute to Heads of Department in the FCO dated 9 May 2003 requested recommendations for the Diplomatic Service List and on 14 May an official wrote the following manuscript note on the minute: 'How about David Kelly? (Iraq being topical).' \" I then describe the publication on 24th September 2002 of the Government's dossier on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. It included the claim that the Iraqi military were able to deploy chemical or biological weapons within 45 minutes of an order to use them (and I refer to this claim as \"the 45 minutes claim\"). I then refer to the Intelligence and Security Committee, which is a Committee of Members of Parliament, established in 1994, to examine the expenditure, administration and policy of the United Kingdom's three intelligence and security agencies. In May 2003 that Committee decided to examine the intelligence relating to Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. On 22nd May 2003 Dr Kelly met Mr Andrew Gilligan, the Defence and Diplomatic Correspondent of the Today programme on BBC Radio 4, in the Charing Cross Hotel, London, and had a discussion with him, and I describe this discussion later in the report in more detail. On 29th May 2003 Mr Gilligan broadcast on the BBC Today programme a number of reports relating to the Government dossier on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The reports were quite lengthy ones, but in the first report at 6.07am introduced by the presenter, Mr John Humphrys the following was said: \"JH: The government is facing more questions this morning over its claims about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Our defence correspondent is Andrew Gilligan. This in particular Andy is Tony Blair saying, they'd be ready to go within forty five minutes. Andrew Gilligan (AG): That's right, that was the central claim in his dossier which he published in September, the main erm, case if you like against er, against Iraq and the main statement of the British government's belief of what it thought Iraq was up to and what we've been told by one of the senior officials in charge of drawing up that dossier was that, actually the government probably erm, knew that that forty five minute figure was wrong, even before it decided to put it in. What this person says, is that a week before the publication date of the dossier, it was actually rather erm, a bland production. It didn't, the, the draft prepared for Mr Blair by the Intelligence Agencies actually didn't say very much more than was public knowledge already and erm, Downing Street, our source says ordered a week before publication, ordered it to be sexed up, to be made more exciting and ordered more facts to be er, to be discovered.\" The allegation in the broadcast that the Government probably knew that the 45 minute figure was wrong even before it decided to put it in, was a very grave allegation which attacked the integrity of the Government and the integrity of the Joint Intelligence Committee and gave rise to a major controversy which dominated the headlines for many days. On 1st June 2003 the Mail on Sunday published an article written by Mr Gilligan describing his discussion with his source in a central London hotel. Part of the article stated that: \"[the Government's dossier on Iraq's WMD] was transformed the week before publication, to make it sexier.\" .......... \"I asked him how this transformation happened. The answer was a single word 'Campbell'.\" On 30th May Ms Susan Watts, the Science Editor of BBC Newsnight, contacted Dr Kelly on the telephone and they had a lengthy conversation about the 45 minutes claim in the Government dossier and the views of the intelligence community about it. Ms Watts recorded this conversation on a tape recorder and the recording was played in the course of the Inquiry. Mr Gilligan's broadcasts on the 27th May having given rise to a major controversy, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee at the House of Commons announced on 3rd June that it would hold an inquiry into the decision to go to war in Iraq, and it is clear that the allegations reported by Mr Gilligan were one of the reasons why the FAC decided to hold its inquiry. On 19th June Mr Gilligan gave evidence to the FAC in relation to his reports on the Today programme on 29th May in respect of the Government's dossier. In his evidence he stated that his reports were based on a single source but he did not identify this source. On 25th June Mr Alastair Campbell gave evidence in relation to the Government's dossier. In the course of his evidence he said that it was untrue for the BBC to allege that the Government took the country into military conflict on the basis of a lie and he further said: \"... the story that I 'sexed-up' the dossier is untrue: the story that I 'put pressure on the intelligence agencies' is untrue: the story that we somehow made more of the 45 minutes command and control point than the intelligence agencies thought was suitable is untrue.\" Mr Campbell also asserted that large parts of the BBC had an anti-war agenda. On 30th June Dr Kelly wrote a lengthy letter to Dr Wells, his line manager in the MoD, in which he stated that he had met Mr Gilligan on 22nd May, but that he was convinced that he was not Mr Gilligan's primary source of information. Dr Wells received Dr Kelly's letter on 1st July and numerous discussions and meeting then took place within the Government as to what action it should take in respect of Dr Kelly's statement that he had met Mr Gilligan. On the evening of Sunday 6th July there was a special meeting of the Board of Governors of the BBC and after the meeting, Mr Gavyn Davies, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the BBC, issued a statement stating that the BBC's overall coverage of the war, and the political issues surrounding it, had been entirely impartial, and that the Board emphatically rejected Mr Campbell's claim that large parts of the BBC had an agenda against the war. The statement also said: \"The Board is satisfied that it was in the public interest to broadcast Mr Gilligan's story, given the information which was available to BBC News at the time. We believe it would not have been in the public interest to have suppressed the stories on either the Today programme or Newsnight.\" It was known that the FAC would publish its report of its Inquiry into the decision to go to war in Iraq on Monday 7th July and the report was published on the morning of 7th July. One of the recommendations in the report was that: \"We recommend that Andrew Gilligan's alleged contacts be thoroughly investigated. We further recommend that the Government review links between the security and intelligence agencies, the media and Parliament and the rules which apply to them.\" The Prime Minister and a number of very senior officials became directly involved in the discussions relating to what action should be taken by the Government in respect of Dr Kelly's statement to the MoD that he had met Mr Gilligan. In the course of his evidence I asked the Prime Minister why so many senior officials were concerned with the matter. The Prime Minister replied: \"I think it was really that this was - I mean, this whole issue was still the dominant issue. You had the Foreign Affairs Select Committee report on the Monday into really the nature of the allegation. Then suddenly at the last minute comes forward somebody who might be the source. And I think there was a real concern on the part of everyone - we were in a quandary, frankly, right from the very beginning. The Foreign Affairs Select Committee is about to report on the Monday, the report is going to deal precisely with the Andrew Gilligan's allegations and here is somebody who suddenly emerges as the person who may be the source of those allegations.\" .......... \"I think the reason why people were involved at a senior level in the Civil Service were first of all that it was very important. Secondly, certainly as the matter developed, I was very, very keen, indeed insistent, that we did have the senior people involved because I anticipated right from the very beginning that there were going to be a lot of questions asked afterwards about: when did you know? Why did you not tell the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee? How could you let them make their report on Monday when you were in possession of information plainly relevant to their report? That was I think the explanation as to why people at a senior level were involved.\" Following a decision taken in Number 10 Downing Street at a meeting chaired by the Prime Minister on Tuesday 8th July, it was decided that the MoD should issue a statement that a civil servant, who was not named, had come forward to volunteer that he had met Mr Gilligan on 22nd May. Later on the afternoon of Tuesday 8th July Mr Richard Hatfield, the Director of Personnel at the MoD telephoned Dr Kelly and read over to him the text of the statement which was to be issued and Dr Kelly said he was content with it. Mr Hatfield then told Dr Kelly that the statement would be issued very soon and that he should talk to the MoD press office and to his line manager about support. The press statement was issued by the MoD about 5.45pm on Tuesday 8th July and commenced by stating: \"An individual working in the MoD has come forward to volunteer that he met Andrew Gilligan of the BBC on May 22. It was an unauthorised meeting. It took place one week before Mr Gilligan broadcast allegations against the Government about the WMD dossier on the Today programme.\" On the evening of 8th July the BBC issued a press statement referring to the MoD statement. In its statement the BBC said that the description of the individual contained in the MoD statement did not match Mr Gilligan's source in some important respects and that they (the BBC) stood by Mr Gilligan's reporting of his source. It is apparent from evidence given by Mrs Kelly that Dr Kelly appreciated that after the MoD press statement was issued on 8th July his name would soon become public knowledge. In her evidence Mrs Kelly described watching the television news with Dr Kelly on the evening of Tuesday 8th July and the main item on the news was that a source had identified itself. Mrs Kelly said: \"Immediately David said to me 'it's me'... My reaction was total dismay. My heart sank. I was terribly worried because the fact that he said that to me, I knew then he was aware his name would be in the public domain quite soon. He confirmed that feeling of course... because the MoD had revealed that a source had made itself known, he, in his own mind, said that he knew from that point that the press would soon put two and two together. We have an amazing press in this country who it does not take them long to find out details of this sort and he is well known of course in his field, so that would have been another easy job for them.\" On the evening of Tuesday 8th July the chief press officer in the MoD telephoned Dr Kelly to alert him to the high level of media interest in the statement which the MoD had issued and to advise him that he might want to consider staying with friends. On Wednesday 9th July there continued to be a great volume of press interest in the name of the civil servant who had come forward and the MoD press office received many calls from journalists seeking more information and trying to identify the civil servant. The press officers in the MoD were working from a question and answer brief which had been given to them by the MoD and they did not volunteer Dr Kelly's name, but the brief stated that if the correct name were put by a journalist it should be confirmed. About 5.30pm the Financial Times put Dr Kelly's name to the Director of News in the MoD and she confirmed the name. Shortly afterwards the Guardian, the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph put Dr Kelly's name to a press officer and the name was confirmed. The name was also confirmed to the Times after it had put twenty names. About 6pm the chief press officer in the MoD heard that Dr Kelly's name had been confirmed to the press. She then telephoned the office of the Permanent Under Secretary of State at the MoD and requested his private secretary to ask Dr Kelly's line manager, Dr Wells, to ring Dr Kelly to tell him that his name had been confirmed to the press. The private secretary tried to contact Dr Wells by telephone for about half an hour and finally got in touch with him about 7pm when Dr Wells was on a train travelling home. Dr Wells then rang Dr Kelly a few minutes after 7pm from the train on his mobile telephone and told him that he had been asked to pass on the message that the press office had confirmed his name to the press. In the late afternoon of 9th July Mr Nicholas Rufford, a reporter from the Sunday Times, drove to Dr Kelly's house in Oxfordshire because he suspected that Dr Kelly might be the person who had spoken to Mr Gilligan. He arrived at Dr Kelly's house about 7.30pm and saw him in his garden. Dr Kelly told him that he had just had a call from the MoD telling him that he would be named in national newspapers the following day. Mr Rufford told him that the press were on their way in droves. After a short conversation Mr Rufford left Dr Kelly's garden. About 8pm Dr Kelly telephoned the chief press officer of the MoD and told her that Nick Rufford had been in contact with him and asked him why he was not now in a hotel, and Dr Kelly said that he had told him that he was now minded to go to family or friends and he would be heading for the West Country and would let her know where he was when he got there. Dr Kelly and his wife then packed some clothes very quickly and left their house in a rush within ten minutes. They spent that night in Weston-super-Mare and the next day travelled to Cornwall where Dr Kelly stayed with his wife until Sunday 13th July when he drove to the home of his daughter, Miss Rachel Kelly, in Oxford, leaving Mrs Kelly at their friends' house in Cornwall. On Thursday 10th July both the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Intelligence and Security Committee requested Dr Kelly to appear before them to give evidence. The MoD agreed to him doing so and Dr Kelly himself also agreed to do so, and he gave evidence to the Foreign Affairs Committee in a hearing televised to the public on 15th July, and he gave evidence to the Intelligence and Security Committee in a private hearing on 16th July. On 14th July Mr Gilligan had sent an e-mail to be passed on to a member or members of the Foreign Affairs Committee stating that Dr Kelly had been Ms Susan Watts source for a report on the 45 minutes claim which Ms Watts had made on Newsnight. In the course of the questions put to him by the Foreign Affairs Committee Mr Richard Ottoway MP, put the following question to Dr Kelly: \"Q131 Richard Ottaway: In response to my colleague, David Chidgey, he gave you a quote which appeared on Newsnight in a programme introduced by Susan Watts. You have confirmed that you have spoken to Susan Watts. Can I take you through the quote again that was read out. You said you did not recognise it. Could you just concentrate on it. It is talking about the 45 minute point. It said: \"The 45 minute point was a statement that was made and it got out of all proportion. They were desperate for information. They were pushing hard for information that could be released. That was the one that popped up and it was seized on and it is unfortunate that it was. That is why there is the argument between the intelligence services and Number 10, because they picked up on it and once they had picked up on it you cannot pull back from it, so many people will say 'Well, we are not sure about that' because the word smithing is actually quite important.\" There are many people who think that you were the source of that quote. What is your reaction to that suggestion? Dr Kelly: I find it very difficult. It does not sound like my expression of words. It does not sound like a quote from me. Q132 Richard Ottaway: You deny that those are your words? Dr Kelly: Yes.\" In the course of questions put to him by members of the Intelligence and Security Committee Mr Alan Howarth MP put the following question to Dr Kelly: \"ALAN HOWARTH: When you went to meet Andrew Gilligan, at the Charing Cross Hotel, did you enter the discussion with an agenda of your own, you've mentioned that you were anxious to learn what you could from him, but did you also go to meet him with a view to conveying any particular points to him. DR KELLY: No, it was very much with the intention of being in receive mode - to understand his experience he had in Iraq.\" On the evening of Wednesday 16th July, after he had given evidence to the Intelligence and Security Committee, Dr Kelly and his wife returned to their home in Oxfordshire. On the morning of Thursday 17th July at 11.18am Dr Kelly sent a number of e-mails replying to friends and colleagues who had sent him messages of support. The following is typical of the e-mails which he sent on that morning: \"Many thanks for your thoughts and prayers. It has been a remarkably tough time. It should all blow over by early next week then I will travel to Baghdad a week Friday.\" In addition to Dr Kelly sending e-mails to friends and colleagues, he was sent on the morning of 17th July a number of e-mails from the MoD relating to a number of Parliamentary Questions tabled by MPs. One Parliamentary Question asked which journalists Dr Kelly had met over the past two years and for what purpose each meeting was held and when each meeting took place. Another Parliamentary Question asked what Civil Service and MoD rules and regulations may have been infringed by Dr Kelly talking to Mr Gilligan, and another Parliamentary Question asked what disciplinary measures the MoD would take against Dr Kelly. In the course of the morning and the early afternoon Wing Commander Clark, who was a colleague of Dr Kelly in the MoD, had some telephone conversations with him about the Parliamentary Question relating to his contact with journalists. After lunch Mrs Kelly went to lie down. Before she did so she asked Dr Kelly what he was going to do and he replied that he would probably go for a walk. After Mrs Kelly had gone to lie down Dr Kelly then came to ask her if she was all right and Mrs Kelly replied that she would be fine. Dr Kelly then left for a walk between about 3 and 3.20pm. Dr Kelly did not return from his walk and Mrs Kelly was joined by two of her daughters during the course of the evening (her third daughter being in Scotland), and they became increasingly worried about him. Mrs Kelly's two daughters went out separately in their cars to look for their father on the roads and lanes along which he might have been walking, but when they found no trace of him they rang the police about 12.20am on Friday 18th July. The Thames Valley Police began an immediate search for Dr Kelly and the search operation was carried out with great efficiency. Sometime about 9am two volunteer searchers found the body of Dr Kelly in a wood at Harrowdown Hill a few miles away from his home. I set out in detail in the report the very careful police and forensic investigations which were made into the death of Dr Kelly and at the end of that account I state: \"In the light of the evidence which I have heard I am satisfied that Dr Kelly took his own life in the wood at Harrowdown Hill at a time between 4.15pm on 17 July and 1.15am on 18 July 2003 and that the principal cause of death was bleeding from incised wounds to the left wrist which Dr Kelly inflicted on himself with the knife found beside his body. It is probable that the ingestion of an excess amount of Coproxamol tablets coupled with apparently clinically silent coronary artery disease would both have played a part in bringing about death more certainly and more rapidly than would have otherwise been the case. Accordingly the causes of death are: 1a Haemorrhage 1b Incised wounds to the left wrist 2 Coproxamol ingestion and coronary artery atherosclerosis I am satisfied that no other person was involved in the death of Dr Kelly for the following reasons: (1) A very careful and lengthy examination of the area where his body was found by police officers and by a forensic biologist found no traces whatever of a struggle or of any involvement by a third party or third parties and a very careful and detailed post mortem examination by Dr Hunt, together with the examination of specimens from the body by a forensic toxicologist, Dr Allan, found no traces or indications whatever of violence or force inflicted on Dr Kelly by a third party or third parties either at the place where his body was found or elsewhere. (2) The wounds to his wrist were inflicted by a knife which came from Dr Kelly's desk in his study in his home, and which had belonged to him from boyhood. (3) It is highly unlikely that a third party or third parties could have forced Dr Kelly to swallow a large number of Coproxamol tablets. These conclusions are strongly supported by the evidence of Professor Hawton [the Professor of Psychiatry at Oxford University], Dr Hunt [the Home Office accredited forensic pathologist] and Assistant Chief Constable Page [of Thames Valley Police]. I am further satisfied from the evidence of Professor Hawton that Dr Kelly was not suffering from any significant mental illness at the time he took his own life.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
