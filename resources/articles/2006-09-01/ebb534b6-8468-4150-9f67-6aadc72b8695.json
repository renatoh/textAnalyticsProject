From President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad downwards, Iranian officials had made it defiantly clear long in advance that there would be no backing down on this key demand. But the predictability of the event does not mean it does not matter. By ignoring the UN security council and its nuclear agency, the IAEA, Iran is cocking a snook at the rest of the world over an issue of profound importance: the danger that nuclear weapons will spread in the already volatile Middle East and encourage others elsewhere to follow suit. Tehran insists it wishes only to use nuclear power to generate electricity as it is entitled to do under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The problem is that few believe that because of its long record of evasion and concealment, and evidence that what it is doing only makes sense if its true goals are military. Still, a US senate committee pointed recently to gaps in the intelligence picture of Iran as big as those which were uncovered after the war in Iraq. Iran may be short on trust, but otherwise it is in an enviable position. The Islamic Republic emerged the clear winner from the US invasion of Afghanistan and the overthrow of the Taliban. In Iraq the demise of Iran's hated Ba'athist enemy has brought the country's Shia Muslim majority to power in Baghdad. Now the war in Lebanon between (nuclear-armed) Israel and Iran's protege Hizbullah has exposed the limits of conventional power in defeating well-equipped Shia fighters who are riding a wave of hostility to Israel and the US. For some, the whole dismal episode was an ominous dress-rehearsal for what might happen if Iran itself ever came under attack. And Iran knows too that cutting its oil exports could trigger another 1970s-style shock that would be devastating to the world economy. Mr Ahmadinejad and colleagues can also see that with Iraq bleeding, none in the US except the most diehard neocons have any appetite for regime change in Tehran, though some in Washington think there is a military option. Israel, its suspicions of Iran sharpened in Lebanon, has signalled it might try a rerun of the bombing of Iraq's nuclear reactor in 1981. International law, military effectiveness and political sense should all rule that out. Iran's intransigence means that sanctions will now be considered by the security council but will be very hard to agree. The fragile unity that produced a UN-endorsed package of economic and technological incentives for Iran is unlikely to survive for long. Russia and China have made clear their opposition to punitive measures. Britain and France, backed by the EU, both said yesterday that they saw the need for more diplomacy. In a situation where there are so few good options, simply playing for time isn't a bad choice. Sanctions would in any case almost certainly be counter-productive and useless if not multilateral. (Bilateral US sanctions, it is worth recalling, have been in force since after the revolution in 1979). The smarter choice would be to take up Iran's offer of \"serious negotiations\" to test whether it might halt enrichment by some other route - though that would have to include a tight UN inspections regime to allay suspicions. Any such effort should be accompanied by intensified contacts with Tehran. The current visit to the US of the former Iranian president. Mohammed Khatami. is a timely reminder of his call for a \"dialogue of civilisations\" in 1998. But he may not even meet Jimmy Carter, let alone George Bush. Iranian confidence, international divisions and the sheer importance of what is at stake here make this a fiendishly difficult tangle. That must be a spur to creativity, not a counsel of despair. Like it or not, Iran's nuclear defiance poses a huge challenge to the battered credibility of the UN. It cannot just be ignored."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
