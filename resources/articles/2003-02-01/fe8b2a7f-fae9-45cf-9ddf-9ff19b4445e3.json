The apartment we had was spacious and well equipped, offering decking on two sides. Unlike many of the other skyscraper hotels that range the coast, the Beach Haven has extensive grounds that include two outdoor swimming pools (one for children), tennis courts and barbecue areas. The views from the top of the building are stunning. The hotel is well placed, being a short strolling distance from the beach, the small shopping centre and, as I recall, not too far from the largest shopping mall in the southern hemisphere, if you like that sort of thing (which I didn't, but wife and daughter did). Peter Ketley \u00b7 There are almost 200 high-rises offering very similar self-catering apartments, and choosing one is a nightmare. Do your research thoroughly and consult the various agents for advice. These include the Gold Coast Accommodation Service, (0061) 7-5592-0067, www.goldcoastaccommodationservice.com.au. The free Qantas and Sunlover 'Gold Coast' brochures available from travel agents are also a good source of listings. Booking at least a week in advance will work out cheaper. An alternative is one of the many motor parks up and down the Gold Coast. The Gold Coast City Council operate a number of these, all with excellent facilities. Visit www.gctp.co.au. The Main Beach Tourist Park, (0061) 7-5581-7722, on Main Beach Parade opposite the main beach has cabins from AUS$30 upwards. Alan Murphy \u00b7 I have stayed in the Surfers International Apartments, located in the centre of Surfers' Paradise and very close to a lifeguard-monitored stretch of beach. They have a swimming pool, great views and very friendly custodians. Details of these and other apartments can be found on www.holidaycity.com/goldcoasthotels. Helena Catt \u00b7 Try www.wotif.com.au. Although it only shows last-minute availability, it gives a good idea of what accommodation is in the area. It had the best range of apartment accommodation than any other site I came across. I used it to choose an apartment, then booked direct.
