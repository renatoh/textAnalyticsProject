Mr Rafsanjani, a moderate cleric, has topped most opinion polls in the contest to replace the reformist president, Mohammad Khatami. The polls have proved unreliable in the past, however, and this election is expected to be Iran's closest election since the present political system was introduced after the Islamic revolution of 1979. After voting, Mr Rafsanjani said: \"I have promised people to continue reforms and I am sure I can deliver my promises.\" If Mr Rafsanjani, seeking to regain the office he held between 1989 and 1997, does not secure 50% of the vote, this will trigger an unprecedented run-off between the two candidates with the most votes. Any such vote would probably be held on June 24. His closest challengers are the reformist former education minister, Mostafa Moin, 54, who has been outspoken on human rights, and the conservative former police chief Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, 43. Either man would be the first non-cleric to serve as president since 1981. The conservative former Tehran mayor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad also appears to have gained ground. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the unelected \"supreme leader\", whose powers dwarf those of the president and the parliament, was among the first to vote, telling Iranians they would be endorsing not only their chosen candidate but also their country's Islamic system. Mr Khamenei said: \"Whoever you vote for among those seven candidates, it is a vote for him, the Islamic republic and the constitution,\" after using a special ballot box at his official residence. The next president will influence Iran's negotiations with the west over its nuclear program and its role as a patron of the Shia Muslim majority in neighbouring Iraq. Washington claims Iran seeks nuclear arms but Iran says its programme is only for energy production. Mr Rafsanjani has portrayed himself as the most experienced figure to handle the sensitive nuclear talks. The US president, George Bush, said yesterday the result of the election would mean little because real power rested with the clerics, \"who suppress liberty at home and spread terror across the world\". \"Power is in the hands of an unelected few who have retained power through an electoral process that ignores the basic requirements of democracy,\" Mr Bush said in a statement. US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, said democracy in Iran was \"moving backwards\" and Washington would watch to see if after the election Tehran followed a course \"more in step with what is going on in the region\". Washington broke ties with Tehran in 1980, and in 2002 Mr Bush grouped Iran with Iraq and North Korea in what he called an \"axis of evil\". As in the last presidential election, all candidates have said they are open to the idea of resuming relations with the US, a position that reflects weariness among Iranians at their isolation from the superpower. Nearly all the candidates, however, say the US must make the first move. No candidate has suggested that Iran could pave the way by addressing US concerns over its nuclear programme, alleged support for terrorist groups and opposition to the Middle East peace process. Mr Rafsanjani said Iran would respond if the US proved it wanted to end enmity. \"If America is willing to improve ties with Iran, it has to show goodwill,\" he said. \"They have already shown us a few positive signs, including accepting Iran's membership of the [World Trade Organisation] WTO and saying Iran has the right to enrich uranium to a limited level.\" The US last month dropped its opposition to Iran's applying to join the WTO. Iran has interpreted comments by Mr Bush indicating that US policy is to stop Tehran enriching uranium to bomb-grade levels as tacit acknowledgement that it will allow purification to lower levels. The unpredictable election race has aroused more interest than expected among Iran's predominantly youthful electorate of 47 million. Social restrictions have been eased and taboos broken in a campaign that has featured adverts containing discussions of sex and religion. But many Iranians say they will not endorse a system where the real power is held by unelected clerics. \"Clerics should not interfere in politics. They should remain as religious leaders,\" Hossein, 51, a mechanic in a town just east of Tehran, told Reuters. The presidential term lasts for four years. Incumbents can stand for a second term, after which they must step down for at least one presidential term, as is the case with Mr Khatami. The outgoing president disappointed Iran's young by backing down on promised reforms and bowing to pressure from hardline clerics. Mr Khatemi told a press conference he hoped for a high turnout, which would strengthen both stability and democracy in Iran. Iran's official television showed long queues outside polling stations but there was no independent indication of the early turnout. Security forces were on high alert but there were no immediate reports of unrest or violence. Last Sunday a bomb killed eight people in the south-western oil city of Ahvaz. The election result is expected on Saturday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
