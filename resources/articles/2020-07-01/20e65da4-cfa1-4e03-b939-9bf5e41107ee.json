Recent draws with Atl\u00e9tico and at Celta Vigo, coupled with Madrid\u2019s earlier 1-0 win at Athletic Bilbao, meant the defending champions kicked off at El Madrigal seven points behind their arch-rivals, but there was no sign of the pressure telling in a breathtaking first-half display. With only three minutes on the clock, Jordi Alba\u2019s low cross from the left was turned into his own net by the Villarreal defender Pau Torres, under pressure from Antoine Griezmann. The home side responded 10 minutes later, Gerard Moreno following up after Santi Cazorla\u2019s shot had been saved by Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen. Barcelona regained the lead in dazzling style after 20 minutes, Lionel Messi setting up Luis Su\u00e1rez, who swept the ball into the far corner from 18 yards. Messi then assisted Griezmann on the stroke of half-time, his back-heel teeing up the Frenchman to score with an audacious chip from the edge of the area. In the second half, Messi thought he had added to Bar\u00e7a\u2019s lead from Sergi Roberto\u2019s pull-back with 20 minutes remaining, only for his goal to be chalked off by VAR for offside. The visitors did add a fourth late on, as the substitute Ansu Fati\u2019s shot from 18 yards deflected in off Ra\u00fal Albiol. Elsewhere in La Liga, Jonathan Silva\u2019s winner at Espanyol kept Legan\u00e9s\u2019 faint hopes of survival alive. Defeat means the home side are all but certain to be relegated for the first time in 27 years. In the day\u2019s other game, Osasuna and Getafe played out a goalless draw. In Serie A, Internazionale\u2019s rocky form continued as they let a goal and man advantage slip in a 2-1 home defeat to mid-table Bologna that leaves them 11 points adrift of the leaders Juventus. Antonio Conte\u2019s side took the lead through Romelu Lukaku in the first half. The Belgian scored his 20th league goal of the season after Lautaro Mart\u00ednez had headed Ashley Young\u2019s cross on to the woodwork. Inter looked in total control when they were awarded a 62nd-minute penalty, soon after Bologna\u2019s Roberto Soriano was sent off for dissent. Mart\u00ednez\u2019s poor effort was saved by Lukasz Skorupski, who also denied Roberto Gagliardini from the rebound. The Bologna substitute Musa Juwara then turned the game on its head, firing his team level before forcing Inter\u2019s Alessandro Bastoni into picking up his second yellow card. Bologna struck again with 10 minutes to play, Juwara\u2019s Gambian compatriot Musa Barrow latching on to a through ball and squeezing a shot under Samir Handanovic. \u201cThere\u2019s an enormous disappointment,\u201d Conte said afterwards. \u201cWe managed to lose a match that we should have [won] comfortably. I\u2019m angry with myself as the coach.\u201d Napoli moved level on points with fifth-placed Roma after a 2-1 win at the Stadio San Paolo, with Lorenzo Insigne curling in a late winner for the home side. Jos\u00e9 Callej\u00f3n had earlier put Napoli ahead from M\u00e1rio Rui\u2019s cross only for Henrikh Mkhitaryan to equalise with a shot from the edge of the area. Roma\u2019s third successive league defeat means they are now 15 points behind fourth-placed Atalanta, who edged past Cagliari to move within a point of Inter in third. Luis Muriel\u2019s first-half penalty was enough to earn victory, but the home side were left aggrieved when Giovanni Simeone\u2019s opener was ruled out by VAR for a handball. \u201cThe disallowed goal is absurd even though it\u2019s in the rules,\u201d said the Cagliari coach, Walter Zenga. \u201cWe are disappointed because it is a decision that goes against the spirit of the game, it\u2019s not a rule that belongs in football.\u201d Genoa earned what could prove to be a vital point in their relegation battle at Udinese, rallying from 2-0 down to earn a draw thanks to Andrea Pinamonti\u2019s 97th-minute equaliser. The Rossobl\u00f9 stay 17th, two points above Lecce and six clear of Brescia, who kept their hopes alive with a 2-0 victory at home to Verona. Karol Linetty scored twice and Manolo Gabbiadini got the other as Sampdoria eased their relegation worries with a 3-0 home win over Spal, who fell to the bottom of the table and appear doomed. In Sunday\u2019s other game, Erick Pulgar\u2019s first-half double earned Fiorentina a 2-1 win at Parma."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
