Previously unpublished NHS data obtained by The Observer reveals that the number of people who had to be taken to hospital over the past five years has risen sharply in every region of the country. The figures, obtained from patient entry records kept by every hospital, come two years after the government relaxed the licensing laws to permit 24-hour drinking and have led critics to demand strong measures to reduce high levels of alcohol-related harm. The figures reveal the number of people who have had to be admitted as emergency cases to hospital as a direct result of their own or someone else's drinking. Examples include victims of assault, people who have suffered an alcohol-related accident or poisoning, and those with liver cirrhosis. The number of men admitted nationwide has risen from 714 per 100,000 in 2001-02 to 909 per 100,000 in 2005-06, a rise of 27.3 per cent, while, over the same period, the number of women has gone up from 396 per 100,000 to 510 per 100,000, a jump of 28.9 per cent. The data, taken from the NHS's Hospital Episodes Survey data system, mean that about 353,000 people across England were taken to hospital in 2005-06 because of drink-related incidents. The north-east has the worst problems. It had the highest number of admissions per 100,000 population for both men and women, with 1,232 per 100,000 for men and 689 per 100,000 for women. That equates to about 15,700 men and 8,800 women. The north-west was close behind, with 1,215 admissions per 100,000 men and 674 per 100,000 among women (about 41,600 men and 23,100 women). The region with the best record is the east of England, with admission figures of 743 men and 425 women per 100,000 population. The figures reveal that a north-south divide is emerging in England's drinking culture. Nine of the 10 areas with the highest rates of emergency admissions are in the north, with Liverpool, Manchester and Middlesbrough in the top five for both men and women. Most of the regions with the fewest emergency admissions are in the south, including Wokingham in Berkshire and Lewisham in south London. Professor Ian Gilmore, president of the Royal College of Physicians, said the figures were 'very worrying'. He said his biggest concern was the relentless rise in each of England's nine regions year-on-year since 2001-02. 'Together with other evidence, such as the growing number of children admitted to hospital because of drink, these data show that we have a serious alcohol problem in this country and measures to date haven't had any discernible effect,' he said. Significant increases in the cost of drinking would have the most immediate impact on consumption, Gilmore said. He also added that the government should review the way drink is promoted and its availability. The figures will be released on Tuesday by the Department of Health. Professor Mark Bellis, director of the Centre for Public Health at Liverpool John Moores University, which compiled the figures, said: 'Far too many people in England are drinking far too much, far too often. 'The high levels of excessive drinking across England are contributing to significant ill-health, which has immediate consequences for individuals and also puts pressure on the NHS, the police and the courts.' Restrictions on when and where people could drink, such as in public parks, needed to be considered, Bellis said. The Association of Chief Police Officers expressed scepticism about plans to relax drinking hours shortly before they became law, warning it could lead to more drunken behaviour in some areas. Anecdotally, rank-and-file police officers report that relaxation of the drinking laws has stretched manpower. 'Police officers are increasingly dealing with confrontational situations, and alcohol is a major part of those situations,' said Jan Berry, chairman of the Police Federation, which speaks on behalf of 130,000 police officers in England and Wales. 'More younger people are drinking and they are drinking much stronger alcohol. It used to be that we could anticipate where the hot spots would be on Fridays and Saturdays, but now it's any night of the week.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
