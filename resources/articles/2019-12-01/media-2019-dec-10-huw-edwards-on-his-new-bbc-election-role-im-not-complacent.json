Amid Conservative threats to examine the BBC licence fee and Channel 4\u2019s broadcasting remit after the election, and BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg having to apologise after being misled over an altercation outside Leeds General Infirmary, public service broadcasters are under immense scrutiny. Edwards said the BBC was \u201ckeenly aware\u201d of how accurate and impartial it has to be and that Dimbleby, who has anchored every previous election night since 1979, would be a \u201ctough act to follow\u201d. \u201cBecause we\u2019re in a place where there\u2019s a huge amount of distrust around \u2013 who\u2019s telling us the truth, who\u2019s not, who\u2019s having us on or not, who\u2019s putting out fake news and all the rest of it \u2013 I think we\u2019re all keenly aware of the fact that \u2026 there\u2019s an even higher premium on producing a results programme which is seen to be accurate, fair and measured in its approach and not drawing any mad conclusions. We\u2019re really aware of it and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving us,\u201d Edwards said. However, having covered elections for the BBC since 1987, he remembered \u201cbeing under pressure from Norman Tebbit, from Alastair Campbell, so I\u2019m not being complacent but I\u2019m kind of used to it\u201d and actually thinks more scrutiny comes from the public via social media. \u201cI feel that much more than political scrutiny or pressure because the audience is able to tell us much more directly what they think. I feel that much more acutely than some unnamed source in No 10 or some unnamed Labour source saying that.\u201d Speaking on set during rehearsals for Thursday night\u2019s coverage, Edwards said he felt a \u201chuge responsibility\u201d as it is such an important election. Dimbleby, he said, told him, \u201cMake it your own, you\u2019ve got to do it your own way\u201d, saying that was something his predecessor did superbly. \u201cHe\u2019s a very tough act to follow so I think that\u2019s good advice. I think the minute you try to be something else it\u2019s not good. For me the big line to cross is to be confident enough to be yourself and do it in your own way and not in a way that other people expect.\u201d The BBC has made other changes: airing its programme from a new location, its London headquarters Broadcasting House, rather than Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, and installing a new high-tech set. Instead of the presenters all being in one big studio together, they are in separate places around the HQ, but virtual reality \u201cportal\u201d screens should make them look as though they are in the same room as Edwards. The BBC\u2019s media cafe is also being used as a results room and is where Reeta Chakrabarti will present and analyse results on a giant touch screen. She said she was proud to be joining the election coverage, and her appointment along with that of Tina Daheley would make this year\u2019s lineup the most diverse yet. \u201cIsn\u2019t that good? It\u2019s 2019 and that should be absolutely natural \u2026 we\u2019ve got to reflect our society back to our audiences.\u201d Edwards will oversee the proceedings from a studio with a virtual backdrop that looks like the centre of Broadcasting House whilst a new \u201ceagle-cam\u201d will swoop across the vast BBC newsroom on a wire. Opposite Edwards will be Andrew Neil who will be quizzing guests and may also finally get to interview Johnson, who has come under fire for being the only major party leader not to be interrogated by him before the election. \u201cIf Boris Johnson comes through a camera maybe we\u2019d finally all get to see it,\u201d election night editor Sam Woodhouse said. \u201cWe\u2019d welcome it with open arms,\u201d added Edwards, \u201cif he pops up in Uxbridge or somewhere, of course.\u201d Woodhouse, who has overseen the last two BBC election nights, has had to juggle creating the new show in the same studios around existing programmes such as Victoria Derbyshire\u2019s show in just six weeks . He said: \u201cThe journalism is actually relatively straightforward on the night. It\u2019s the all the kit and the tech [that can be an issue]. Last week all the results servers blew up, yesterday all the outside broadcast blew up.\u201d The wrinkles have now been ironed out and using Broadcasting House should save money for the BBC in the long-term as the new technology installed will be used by other programmes such as Newsnight. Woodhouse said there would be \u201clots of additional security\u201d around the building and different servers around the country to use should a cybersecurity breach be detected. Channel 4 is taking a different tack to the political scrutiny with its Alternative Election Night hosted by Krishnan Guru-Murthy, Katherine Ryan and Rylan Clark-Neal. Channel 4 commissioning editor for news and current affairs, Louisa Compton, said it \u201chas an amazing lineup of comedians and politicians with a host of different views. It will offer all the results and impartial analysis you could want as well as asking the questions that no one else would have the balls to ask.\u201d Meanwhile ITV\u2019s coverage will be hosted by Tom Bradby, who will again be joined by Ed Balls and George Osborne."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
