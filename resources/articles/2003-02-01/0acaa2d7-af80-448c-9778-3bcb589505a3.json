An achievement that may be, but the best news for Wales was neither Robert Earnshaw's eighth-minute equaliser nor John Hartson's second 66 minutes later but the score from Podgorica in Yugoslavia yesterday. Yugoslavia, now requesting to be renamed as Serbia-Montenegro, drew 2-2 at home to Azerbaijan. This was a Group 9 qualifier and, had the Yugoslavs won, the Welsh lead in the group would have been cut to two points. Instead it is four points and Wales travel to Belgrade in April knowing that a win or a draw would be a major boost in their qualification aims. Bosnia may be joint bottom of their European qualifying group, along with Luxembourg, but they played with feisty enthusiasm from the beginning and gave the Welsh an early shock by taking the lead. Elvir Baljic of Galatasaray scored the goal, a beautifully clean strike past Darren Ward after five minutes. Baljic is not to be confused with Elvir Bolic, who once scored for Fenerbahce at Old Trafford, though Bolic also played last night. Wales' response was swift. Craig Bellamy, starting on the left in the absence of the injured Ryan Giggs, made the first of several penetrating runs. When the cross came in, John Hartson leapt and the ball ran to Earnshaw. The Zambian-born striker swivelled slickly and from 20 yards hit a shot diagonally back across from where the ball had come. It beat Kenan Hasagic comprehensively. But the Bosnians were equally effective and deservedly regained the lead in the second half when Sergei Barbarez headed in a Baljic centre from two yards. Hartson then missed a glorious chance in the 72nd minute but made amends with a cool finish two minutes later. It meant that Wales went past the record set by the side of the early 1980s. Wales (4-3-3): Ward (Crossley, h-t); Weston (Jones, 61), Melville, Page, Speed; Davies, Pembridge, Savage; Earnshaw (Koumas, 77), Hartson (Taylor, 81), Bellamy. Bosnia-Herzegovina (4-5-1): Hasagic; Berberovic, Konjic, Hibic, Music; Beslija, Biscevic (Velagic, 90), Barbarez (Miskovic, 80) Grujic (Mulina 78) Baljic (Hrgovic, 78); Bolic (Haliovic, 90). Referee: D Malcolm (N Ireland)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
