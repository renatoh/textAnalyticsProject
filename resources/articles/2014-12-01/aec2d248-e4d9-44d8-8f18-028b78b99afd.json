The incidents of family and sexual violence escalate over Christmas and New Year. \u201cIt\u2019s the busiest time of the year [for service providers],\u201d Moo Baulch from Domestic Violence New South Wales said. \u201cDomestic violence becomes a lot more visible at this time of the year.\u201d Financial pressures, increased time spent with family and alcohol consumption all play a role in the higher than usual number of cases of domestic violence, Baulch said. She also notes that disgruntled parents whose access to children is cut off before the holidays become \u201cresentful and angry\u201d at this time of year, making it a dangerous time of year for estranged partners. \u201cChristmas is a prime time for people who are into power and control to dominate,\u201d said Karen Willis, chief executive officer of Rape and Domestic Violence Services Australia. Willis said perpetrators use \u201cpsychological warfare\u201d to \u201cundermine and ridicule\u201d the hard work their partners had put into producing the perfect family gathering. Willis\u2019 service receives 50,000 calls for assistance a year, and employs up to 20 additional counsellors over summer to meet demand. Around-the-clock services like Queensland\u2019s Women\u2019s House Shelta face increased pressures to take on the overflow from shelters that are closed or full. \u201cA lot of shelters are closed or have fewer staff over the holiday period,\u201d shelter worker Lani, who declined to give her surname, said. \u201cNot all shelters are at full capacity,\u201d she said, adding that her service is always open and staffed. \u201cIt\u2019s business as usual for us.\u201d NSW assistant commissioner Mark Murdoch, who heads up the force\u2019s response to domestic violence, says there is a spike in the number of reported cases of family violence from October to March. \u201cIn some parts of the state, response to domestic violence amounts to 40% of everything we do,\u201d Murdoch said. He praised the good work police are doing in the area, saying the force is \u201cbecoming a lot more professional\u201d in the way it treats survivors and their families. Murdoch points to the introduction of domestic violence liaison officers and a more integrated approach to social services as examples of how the NSW police force are working to stamp out the scourge of family violence. \u201cThe whole of government response is getting better year by year,\u201d he said. Police across the country take a zero-tolerance approach to family violence, Murdoch said. \u201cIf you commit domestic violence, police will arrest you \u2026 and you will be held to account.\u201d Willis has praised the efforts of police during a year of high-profile cases of domestic violence, including Luke Batty\u2019s murder and the stabbing deaths of eight Cairns children. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of leadership in the force,\u201d Willis said. \u201cIt\u2019s a million times better than it was. Now services and police work together \u2026 we\u2019re each half of one whole in terms of response to domestic violence.\u201d Baulch said police have responded compassionately in tough situations. She is heartened by the increase in public awareness of domestic violence. \u201cThe more we\u2019re able to have a conversation around this, the better,\u201d Baulch said. \u2022 Anyone experiencing domestic or family violence can call the 24-hour national support line on 1800 737 7328."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
