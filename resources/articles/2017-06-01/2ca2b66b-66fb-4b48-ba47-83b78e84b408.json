Renan Calheiros quit his post just hours after the supreme court sent a request to the legislature for the president to be put on trial for allegedly accepting millions of dollars in bribes from the meat-packing company JBS. The departing senate leader has long been a rival of Temer\u2019s inside the centre-right Brazilian Democratic Movement party and apparently wants to distance himself from the deeply unpopular president ahead of a re-election bid next year. In a statement to announce his resignation, Calheiros hinted at the power struggles taking place inside the ruling camp. \u201cI have no vocation to be a puppet,\u201d he declared. The timing could not be worse for the president, whose approval rating has fallen to 7% less than a year after he seized power with an impeachment plot against his predecessor and former running mate Dilma Rousseff of the Workers party. Earlier this week, Temer became the first president in history to be formally charged with a crime by the attorney general. Based on secretly recorded phone conversations and testimonies from JBS executives, he is accused of taking bribes and trying to obstruct justice by arranging hush-money payoffs to the jailed former head of the lower house of Congress, Eduardo Cunha. The supreme court has sent the corruption charge to Congress. If two-thirds of deputies vote for a trial, the president could be removed from office. Temer has denied the charges and refused to resign. In a televised address, he accused the attorney general of creating a \u201cfiction\u201d to paralyse the country and hold up his government\u2019s reform program. But prosecutors are closing in. Eight ministers, four past presidents and dozens of lawmakers \u2013 including Calheiros \u2013 are either on trial or under investigation by judicial officers working on the Lava Jato (Car Wash) corruption probe. The ruling camp currently has enough votes to block a trial of Temer, but support is ebbing as allies fear a public backlash ahead of next year\u2019s elections. Last weekend, the former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso \u2013 an influential figure in the Democratic Socialist party of Brazil \u2013 urged the president to stand down for the sake of the country."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
