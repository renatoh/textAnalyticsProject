Would you want Cliff Richard singing your praises?", "bodyText": "There is the vaguest suspicion that Mr Blair's A-team is in the grip of some kind of recruitment crisis. The A-Team, fans of the superior 80s action series will recall, were a crack team of individuals whose job it was to defend various clients from whatever slings and arrows they faced. There was a tactically astute master of disguise, a mechanical expert, a con man, and a theatrically unhinged but brilliant helicopter pilot. It was a flawless and deadly combination, and their protectees never lost. In days of yore, Blair would rely on a similar system with the media when he got into hot water. When it was judged that a reconnection with the working class was needed, John Prescott was sent to the studios. It was Nanny Jowell for gentle soothing, Margaret Beckett for an always-adroit media performance (how extraordinary that now seems, but it was so), John Reid when only being bored into submission by a pub hectoring would do, and so on. For diverse reasons, these personnel have gone rather quiet of late, and so it is that in the past week, a mere three people whom we might describe as \"of note\" have ventured on the record to defend Blair. They are Lord Falconer, Stephen Byers and Cliff Richard. Clearly, it would be the most monstrous flattery to this triumvirate to refer to them as the B-team. In fact, when seeking the appropriate letter to prefix this shower of terminal loyalists, we need not even trouble ourselves with the first half of the alphabet. One's initial instinct is that this makes the PM look a little needy. Upon deeper consideration, however, it is clear that it makes him look a lot needy. Do consider our three musketeers. First into battle was Stephen Byers, who emerged just over a week ago from wherever he has been closeted to pen the first of a series of trenchant broadsheet comment pieces. From what one can glean from these faintly opaque articles (he appears to believe it is always a good day to bury a bad point), Byers judges himself charged with a lone sniper mission, in which he must terminate Gordon Brown with extreme prejudice. First up was his suggestion that inheritance tax should be scrapped, an idea that underwhelmed even the experimental David Cameron; yesterday, he alluded audaciously to the \"anoraks in the Treasury\". The chancellor is not yet believed to have fled to his bunker. Next into the fray for Blair was Cliff Richard, who chose these very pages to pour scorn on the suggestion that the \"friendship\" between a famed celebrity Conservative and a Labour leader was in any way transactional. Rather, Cliff ascribed his relationship with the PM to that most well worn of showbiz dynamics: two lonely megastars coming together. \"He must have great difficulty,\" he explained, \"in the same way people like myself do, in finding friends who want you for yourself.\" There are those of us who will just tolerate such sob stories when they are applied to poor little rich pop stars such as Robbie Williams, but find their reserves of sympathy suddenly dry when asked to dig emotionally deep for a politician who has been sucking up to rich people since well before he hit the big time, and whose \"friendship\" with the man from whom he accepts tens of thousands of pounds worth of free hospitality each summer does not extend to his host feeling able to place the occasional social phone call to him. \"I wouldn't think of calling Tony up,\" mused Cliff. Grateful as the PM definitely was for Cliff's intervention, it was left to his former flatmate Lord Falconer to underscore his continuing star power. Naturally, we must always beware of setting too much store by his lordship's pronouncements. \"We will be glad we did it,\" he told a journalist inquiring about the Dome in 1999. \"Believe me. Write that down.\" But it is his view of the key Blairite strength which is perhaps the greatest cause for concern. \"In terms of being a world statesman,\" he told Sky News at the weekend, \"I don't think anybody could do the job better than Tony Blair.\" Well, you hear a lot about the skills shortage, but this seems to indicate a veritable crisis. Blair's memorable recent contributions to the annals of statesmanship have consisted of failing to secure early US support for a ceasefire in Lebanon, and being photographed giggling in Barbados aboard a yacht named Good Vibrations, at the precise moment his chosen deputy was being deemed too halfwitted to handle briefing the press on a terror attack that never happened. Flippancy aside, of all the questionable qualities with which Blair is credited, this reputation as some kind of George Washington figure is the most baffling. Putting aside his administration's achievements in Northern Ireland, which now seem a political age ago, his statesman's trophy cupboard looks desperately bare. His sole apparent skill in this arena is sounding comparatively intelligent and articulate when sharing a podium with George Bush, which in terms of dazzling accomplishments is a little like looking slim when standing next to John Prescott. Most chastening for Blair, of course, is that until another nebbish emerges from the woodwork to leap to his defence, even his Z-team is one short of the requisite four. Geoff Hoon ... has your moment finally arrived? At last, there is cast-iron evidence that the government had given 10 minutes or so of thought to what might happen after the first phase of the Iraq invasion was complete. A 2004 report into the country's tourism possibilities has been released under the Freedom of Information Act, and though one wouldn't go so far as to call it an exit strategy, it certainly makes for uplifting reading. \"War Tourism\", reads a particularly enticing section headline. \"This would involve presentation of the country's recent history and, while there is a distinct need to improve the country's general environment\" - well, no rush - \"it may be necessary and indeed beneficial to place battlefield debris strategically, such that it can be enjoyed by those groups wishing to see for themselves the location of recent battles.\" Alas, Iraq teetering on the brink of civil war means its Disneyfication remains tantalisingly unrealised just at present. Interested parties should use the breathing space to design a shock and awe thrill ride. \u00b7 This week Marina read John Updike's Rabbit Redux: \"As mentioned previously, I think people can just about live without my thoughts on a book after it's been around this long ...\" Marina concluded a home season of Jean-Claude Van Damme movies: \"If attempting a similar exercise, I'd draw the line well before The Quest.
