Nah, I can't see it either - Britain isn't quite ready for the sight of our Tone in jodhpurs. But invite the Prime Minister of Lithuania to his country's most famous horse race and he is right in there. And did I mention that this race is run on a frozen lake? The going at Lake Sartai's not good to firm; it's icy to lethal. Predictably, the Lithuanian PM, Algirdas Brazauskas, lost control of his horse and was thrown to the ground. A bit humiliating, maybe, but I bet it was a vote winner. He's clearly a game old boy, because apparently the agriculture minister once had to rescue him when a horse dragged him across a field during a ploughing contest - Brazauskas has satisfied himself with gentle glad-handing at Sartai since then. Shame. My partner Carolyn and I wanted to explore Lithuania beyond the winding streets of Vilnius's Old Town and Sartai was a perfect opportunity. It lies 150km north-east of the capital, through the endless forests that dominate the Lithuanian countryside. In early February, the lake seemed sufficiently frozen for racing, but we soon discovered that the contest would be run on an ice track around the shore. The organisers blamed a mild winter for the apparent loss of nerve, but I suspected that Lithuania's impending EU membership had made them twitchy. EU directive 145/18 (part F) does, after all, state: 'Member states are expressly forbidden from orchestrating or facilitating equine events on ice if the aforesaid quadrupeds are shod with iron that bends 12 degrees beyond the perpendicular - that's to say ... oh, come on guys, do you really think this is a sensible European thing to be doing?' But the crowds weren't going to be put off by this small change of plan. Races on ice began hundreds of years ago and have survived clampdowns by the Russians, Nazis and Russians (again), who all considered them to be a dangerous display of national pride. Independent Lithuanians are now free to indulge their passion and up to 40,000 people make the annual pilgrimage to Sartai to watch the trotting races. We arrived just as they were about to start and joined the crowds on the rails. A black smudge a couple of hundred metres away became a fast-moving line of six competitors which sped past us in a spray of ice shards. The riders lay prone, just above the flashing wheels that slashed into the ice, cracking their whips inches above the horses' ears. Not quite Ben Hur, but I still wouldn't fancy Tony's chances. Off they flew into the distance on the mile-long oval. A couple of minutes later and they were back, the spectators applauding the winning rider whose colours were now splattered with ice and mud, his face a brown mask. We tried to pick a winner by studying trotting actions, but had to resort to, 'Ooh, hasn't that horse got beautiful eyelashes' (Carolyn) and 'My money's on number six - the jockey's colours are just the shade of fuchsia I want for my bedroom' (me). John McCririck eat your heart out. Close study also failed to answer the obvious question: what keeps the horses on four hooves - why don't their legs shoot out from under them and leave them on their bellies in a startled cartoon pose? One triumphant jockey received her prizes - \u00a3300 and, er, a garland of sausages. The thickness of the ice on other Lithuanian lakes clearly hadn't troubled the EU bureaucrats. A day earlier, we had spotted dots far out on the frozen surface of a lake near Vilnius. It was just too intriguing to resist. We slipped and slid to the middle as the dots resolved into people hunched over tiny holes in the ice. The first figure was huddled from the drizzle under a plastic sheet until a hand with lilac fingernails reached out to check the fishing line. A friendly face appeared and gestured at her catch, tiddlers flopping desperately on the ice - that night's dinner. Three men invited me to have a go and I tickled the foot-long rod to get a hook jumping provocatively just above the lake floor. I didn't even get a nibble, and wasn't sure I had the patience to sit there, gazing morosely into a hole - surely these fishermen had something stronger than soup in their flasks to see them through the day. Useful things lakes, especially when frozen. There's horseracing, fishing, and, of course, swimming. Or, to be more precise, plunging. Our guide, Linas, had arranged a visit to a wood-fired sauna. We changed into our cossies and Linas explained the technique: you can't just sit there until you feel a bit hot and then leap into the lake. Far too dangerous. You need to get hot, stand in the snow for a while, heat up again and repeat a few times, slowly bringing your blood to boiling point. By the time I thought I'd melted into the puddle at my feet, Linas told me to thrash myself with birch twigs and I obeyed, unquestioningly, with leaves flying in all directions. Then I was ready, he declared. I ran to the jetty and jumped into the four feet-wide hole. Actually, I thought, that's not too bad. Actually, that's rather nice. Actually, I thought, as my teeth turned into a clockwork set of gnashers, that's life-threatening. I scrambled out and fled back to the sauna's warm embrace. But the process felt good and I repeated it three times. Fantastic. After we dressed, the sauna's owner, Vlad\u00e9, treated us to samane, a home-made, only slightly illegal vodka, and explained how she was welcoming more and more overseas visitors to her guesthouse. We could only see expanses of frozen water and unwelcoming forest but, come spring and summer, the area's a huge draw for kayaking, hiking and camping holidays. Vlad\u00e9 and her family had been sent to Siberia when she was a child, only being allowed to return a few years later. Memories of the Soviet era are never far away in Lithuania, but it seems to have come through the period remarkably level-headed. The country's geographical position makes its people open to upheaval - Lithuania is a bone that's been fought over for centuries by Russia, Germany and Poland. Maybe that explains why Lithuanians accepted with wry humour the creation of a sculpture park south-west of Vilnius known locally as Stalinworld. The country gleefully pulled down all the statues of Stalin, Lenin and co on independence but, miraculously, they weren't broken into a million pieces. A decade later, they were back on their feet in a drained swamp. Russian military music blared out of loudspeakers on watchtowers linked by barbed wire fences as we wandered the park, peering at these fallen heroes of Communism. Uncle Joe's disembodied head peaked out from the snow and Lenin reached out to a long-gone crowd - I was surprised Lithuanians didn't take the opportunity to lob some well-aimed snowballs. Despite its echoes of bloody purges and mass transportations, the park is a popular day out for families. Don't worry about the young ones having nightmares, though, there's also a bright children's playground next to the Soviet cannons. A far more dangerous legacy of the USSR lies east of Vilnius, in the forest near the border with Belarus. The Ignalina nuclear power plant was built to the same design as Chernobyl. A camera in the visitor centre should have let us see the control room, but the screen was blank - a guide explained that the employees didn't like to be watched, so he pulled out the cable. Hmm, can't you just picture a blissfully unaware Homer Simpson wolfing down doughnuts as Springfield's plant goes into meltdown? We toured Visaginas, the town built in the 1970s for the workers. Most had been shipped in from Russia and still lived in the decaying blocks of flats, guarded by a giant Geiger counter that mysteriously blipped up and down every few seconds. Communism was always going to find it tough going in Lithuania - it's the most ethnically homogenous nation in Europe and overwhelmingly Roman Catholic. Both factors contribute to a fierce sense of nationhood and both express themselves at the extraordinary Hill of Crosses, near the city of Siauliai, two hours north of Vilnius. Crosses first appeared here in the 14th century and millions now cover the hill, spreading down its sides and marching across the surrounding fields. Some are huge, others just a few inches high; some intricate, others simple. Colourful rosaries drip from their limbs, swaying in the wind. Some are devoted to the dead, others were planted by families and newly-weds seeking a blessing. Many seemed to have been planted for Lithuania itself. Like the races at Sartai, the hill has survived as a mark of the country's independence and now Lithuania's place in Europe has been confirmed. I can't wait to see their prime minister giving Tony a few action man tips at EU summits, but maybe he should start on a small scale - the toe-wrestling champion-ships in Derbyshire, perhaps?
