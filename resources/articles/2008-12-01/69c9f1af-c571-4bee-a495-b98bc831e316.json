Back to form having departed the first four ranking events of the season at the earliest available opportunity, Murphy reached the UK Championship final with a 9-4 victory over Stephen Maguire. Murphy led 6-2 following an unforgettable opening session and although Maguire compiled two centuries on the resumption the Scot could not repeat his win when they met at the same stage of this tournament last year. \"I felt as fresh as a daisy because all I've done for the last four months is watch other people play on television,\" said Murphy, the 2005 world champion. Fu stands on the verge of a career-defining success, aided by a girlfriend who has recently completed a masters degree in supply chain logistics and a former bus conductor and blacksmith's apprentice who became a world champion. Fu's support team consist of his girlfriend, Shirley, who is attending her first tournament, and Terry Griffiths, the king of The Crucible in 1979, one of the sport's true gentlemen and these days recognised as its most knowledgeable coach. After capturing his first world-ranking title, the Grand Prix, 14 months ago, Fu's start to this season was discouraging, but, with Griffiths recovering from illness, a visit to the Matchroom Club in Llanelli for cue-action therapy was not available. It was only when Griffiths returned to work that Fu had the platform for a return to optimum form. \"Technically, I'd slipped into a few bad habits but I spent a couple of days with Terry and now I'm hitting the ball much better,\" said Fu."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
