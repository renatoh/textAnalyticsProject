It will on Tuesday appoint Labour peer Lady Sherlock to take a wide-ranging look at the laws for campaigners, charities and trade unions, which have complained the coalition's new legislation restricts their free speech in the run-up to elections. The Lobbying Act, which received royal assent in February, has been dubbed the \"gagging law\" by charities for restrictions it places on the ability of third parties to campaign in election periods. Sherlock, a former adviser to Gordon Brown and an ex-head of the Refugee Council, will be tasked with drawing up plans for replacement legislation that would stops wealthy individuals influencing elections through pressure groups at the same time protecting the place of campaigners in public debate. In a speech, Stephen Twigg, shadow constitutional and political reform minister, will say: \"Baroness Sherlock will look at what regulation is needed to offer further protection of civil society's freedom of speech. Labour wants a healthy and thriving campaigning and charity sector \u2013 that can stand up to vested interests. We will build a regulatory framework which encourages this.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
