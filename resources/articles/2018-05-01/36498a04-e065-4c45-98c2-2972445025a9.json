United\u2019s 1-0 defeat by Chelsea in Saturday\u2019s FA Cup final meant they ended the campaign without a trophy. United also finished as runners-up in the Premier League, a record 19 points behind Manchester City. While second is their highest placing since claiming the title five years ago, there was further disappointment in the Champions League, with United knocked out in the last-16 stage by Sevilla. Matic is clear that United have to strengthen. \u201cWe need some players with experience to bring more qualities to our team,\u201d the midfielder said. \u201cAfter that, we can fight for the title and the Champions League also.\u201d Matic also accepts the lack of silverware will put more pressure on United next season. \u201cThis is football,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t win one year the next year is always more pressure. When you play for Manchester United this is normal and we have to accept and deal with that. \u201cWe have improved. Last year United were sixth. The year before, fifth. So we improve, we are second. The only team who is better than us is Man City. They play amazing football. But we are second and in the Champions League next year, which is the most important thing. \u201cWhen you win a trophy it\u2019s different and you feel better but the most important thing is that we can look in the mirror and know we gave our best [against Chelsea]. The team was sad after the game \u2013 we know we deserved more \u2013 but this is football. It is a final, everything can happen, so we have to be focused on the next challenge.\u201d Chelsea\u2019s winner came via an Eden Hazard penalty that he won after Phil Jones was caught out of position and fouled the Belgian. \u201cEveryone can make a mistake,\u201d said Matic. \u201cSometimes I make mistakes, but this is football. \u201cHe worked for sure to do the best for the team \u2013 he always fights for the team. I can\u2019t blame him because he gives 100%. He needs to forget and be focused on the next challenge. \u201cChelsea have some players that can punish every mistake like Hazard did so we have to accept, see where we can improve, and next year to try and win some trophies. \u201cWe played 90 minutes of good football. It was better in the second half but in the first we controlled the game but conceded a goal from one mistake.\u201d Jos\u00e9 Mourinho did not send his players away with a message to contemplate during their break from club football \u2013 \u201cWe didn\u2019t speak with him,\u201d said Matic \u2013 and the manager is now on holiday, conscious that United\u2019s prospects of closing the gap to City and going into the Champions League closing stages next year depend on the club\u2019s business in the transfer window. Regarding the major signings Matic points to, Mourinho wants a right-back and a left-back to replace Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young, who are both converted wingers. Juventus\u2019s Alex Sandro is thought to have overtaken Tottenham\u2019s Danny Rose as Mourinho\u2019s first choice for left-back and he wants an equally dynamic right-back to replace Valencia. The future of Anthony Martial remains in doubt, as his 13-minute cameo as a replacement against Chelsea underlined, so the manager is also targeting a new attacker. Ajax\u2019s Justin Kluivert is one potential replacement. While 10 goals in 30 league games for a 19-year-old wide-forward is impressive, he lacks the experience Matic cites. Michael Carrick\u2019s retirement \u2013 he is now a member of Mourinho\u2019s coaching staff \u2013 and Marouane Fellaini\u2019s potential departure will leave Mourinho with only Ander Herrera, Paul Pogba and Matic as frontline midfielders. Scott McTominay emerged this year but is 21 and has only 25 first-team appearances. Given the manager\u2019s mistrust of Pogba, he may have to sign at least one midfielder. Mourinho would like to strengthen at centre-back, too \u2013 possibly freeing up a berth by selling Chris Smalling \u2013 but there are only so many high-grade signings possible in the window. Next season promises to be the defining one for Mourniho. As Young said: \u201cWe have to come back stronger \u2013 in the league, the FA Cup, the League Cup, the Champions League. We want to be fighting on all fronts.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
