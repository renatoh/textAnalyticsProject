Transparency about what everyone earns, about how pay is decided, and also about promotion and recruitment across all areas of the Corporation. There is no legal bar to doing this. The BBC just needs to change the expectations of people working here, by telling them that in future their pay will be transparent. The BBC says it wants to be \u201cthe most transparent organisation when it comes to pay\u201d. Full publication of individual salaries and benefits (and other payments through BBC Studios and all commercial arms) would have a lasting positive impact on the culture of the BBC and beyond. There are many reasons for doing this now: 1. It\u2019s the fastest, cheapest and fairest way to begin to tackle unequal pay at the BBC. When everyone knows exactly what everyone is paid, it is easy to identify comparators and start conversations about value. Transparency is the tool that can stop the BBC breaking the law on Equal Pay. 2. At the same time, transparency is by far the most effective way to uncover pay discrimination of all kinds \u2013 against ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, LGBTQ+ people, or on the basis of age or any other legally protected characteristic. 3. It\u2019s also the best way to uncover pay differences linked to characteristics which may not be legally protected but which employers committed to fairness should want to monitor, such as bias linked to class, educational background or regional origin. 4. There is increasing evidence that pay transparency is good for employers, not just for employees. We believe it will save a lot of money. Our pay structure is likely to flatten as very high salaries become even harder to justify. And the cost of the BBC\u2019s current approach is not just financial, it has also eroded trust and morale. This change in culture will attract and retain great people, because people want to work in places where they are heard and respected, and where they understand how their pay is set. 5. The BBC spends public money. The public deserves to know how that money is spent. We love the BBC and believe in its values of transparency and accountability. We want to work with you to help the BBC live up to those values, and to restore the trust of staff and audiences in the BBC\u2019s stated commitments.
