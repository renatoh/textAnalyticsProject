Though not a straightforward ride - he apparently dislikes being crowded in his races - High Accolade (3.05) has shown steady improvement since joining Marcus Tregoning following a juvenile campaign with Richard Hannon. Martin Dwyer brought him with a sweeping run down the outside of the field to win the Predominate Stakes at Goodwood last month and there looked to be more in the locker. Russian Rhythm (3.45) has history against her in the Coronation Stakes, as it was in 1979 that the Newmarket 1,000 Guineas winner last followed up here. However, Sir Michael Stoute's filly is difficult to oppose. Working moderately at home before the Classic, she nevertheless won in the style of an exceptional filly. Soviet Song was four lengths away fourth, but could get closer to Russian Rhythm now that James Fanshawe's stable has hit form. Shanty Star (4.55) looks another strong contender from the in-form Mark Johnston stable in the Queen's Vase, a race won by the Middleham trainer with And Beyond two years ago. There were excuses for Shanty Star after the Lingfield Derby Trial, and this colt appeals as the right sort for this two-miler. Tolzey (2.30), second to the classy Attraction at Beverley, and Binary File (4.20) can also oblige."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
