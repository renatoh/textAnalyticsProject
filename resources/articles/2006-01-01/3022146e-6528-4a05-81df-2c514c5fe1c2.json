Announcing the long-delayed green paper in the Commons, the work and pensions secretary, John Hutton, called it a \"new chapter in the evolution of the modern welfare state\". Mr Hutton told MPs the changes - promised in Labour's election manifesto - should cull 1 million claimants from the 2.7 million total who currently claim the benefit, saving between \u00a34bn and \u00a37bn over 10 years. The benefit will be renamed employment and support allowance from 2008, with higher payments for the chronically disabled, but interviews, action plans and work placements for those deemed capable of some form of employment. Those who refuse to cooperate will be docked successively until it falls to the current level of job seeker's allowance, Mr Hutton told MPs. The plans now go out to a three-month consultation period, although there was a surprisingly muted reaction from Labour backbenchers in the Commons. Although Mr Hutton was accompanied by the PM at Brent Cross shopping centre this morning to launch the green paper, neither Mr Blair nor the chancellor, Gordon Brown, were present in the Commons to hear the announcement - despite it being one of the most contentious elements of Labour's third term. At the launch, the PM admitted that the \"New Labour bus had always been difficult to drive\" over issues such as this and the even more controversial forthcoming education bill. \"Most MPs, particularly Labour ones with large numbers of people on incapacity benefits, know that this whole system spiralled out of control really in the 1980s and early 90s when unemployment was very high. \"But we have got two million more jobs in the British economy today and I think both Labour MPs, not just any MPs, but Labour MPs themselves with high numbers of people on incapacity benefits know that for the future we could help many of those people get off benefits and into work and do something productive with their lives.\" \"I think we will find if we pursue this in the right way and do it in a way that's sensitive to the genuine need that people have we will be able to lift people off benefits and into work and well, we will wait and see, but I think most Labour MPs will support that.\" In 1999, 67 Labour MPs voted against cuts in incapacity benefit, but today's green paper dropped potential flashpoints such as means testing, or financial incentives for doctors to sign fewer sick notes for patients. One of those rebels from six years ago, Roger Berry, today welcomed the plans, whilst Labour's Anne Begg, who uses a wheelchair, said there would be a \"collective sigh of relief\" from disabled organisations about the plans, and she was glad that \"at long last we have something to discuss\". With 40% of IB claimants suffering mental illness, the charity Sane expressed worries that the moves could lead to further illness and even hospitalisation among those stressed and depressed. And the Labour-friend thinktank the Institute for Public Policy Research warned the success of the scheme would depend on competently trained Jobcentre staff. But Mr Hutton's Tory shadow, Philip Hammond, said his party \"broadly welcomes the thrust\" of the long-delayed green paper. \"We believe work works,\" he told the Commons, adding that the government had done \"sweet nothing\" up until now on the issue. Mr Hutton announced that in the most concentrated areas for claimants employment advisers will be deployed within GP surgeries, with the first pilot scheme in place within a month. Claimants other than those who are severely ill or disabled will have to take part in work-related interviews and agree an action plan or face losing part of their benefits as part of the measures unveiled today. The green paper, A New Deal for Welfare: Empowering People to Work, will end rising payments according to time claimed for those on incapacity benefit, which the government calls \"perverse\". A unit will be set up to check on people claiming incapacity benefit to make sure they were still ill and new medical evidence will be required. More help will be offered to lone parents but in return they will be expected to make serious efforts to find a job, especially when their youngest child goes to secondary school. Interviews with lone parents whose youngest child is at least 11 will be held every three months while those on benefit for a year will have to visit a jobs adviser every six months, twice as often as now. The government also unveiled plans to increase the number of older workers by 1 million. People aged between 50 and 59 will have to take up job seeking support and employers will be urged to extend flexible working arrangements. Despite the threat of a Labour rebellion - 67 backbenchers voted against IB cuts in 1999 - Mr Blair this morning insisted that most Labour MPs support his reforms of the incapacity benefit system. The Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman, Danny Alexander, said today: \"The government is right to try to tackle the scandal of incapacity benefit, and the Liberal Democrats are willing to work constructively with the government to help people with disabilities get back to work.\" The CBI's deputy director-general, John Cridland, said: \"The government must support companies in reskilling those who have been out of work for some time, and by contributing to the consequential costs of special equipment, transport or mentoring.\" Kate Green, chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said: \"Increasing employment should help to fulfil the government's pledge to end child poverty, but ministers must remember that work is not a guaranteed route out of poverty. \"Disabled people still face discrimination in the labour market and without the right training and support they will simply end up in poor quality, low paid jobs.\" Citizens Advice senior social policy officer John Wheatley said: \"With 30,000 jobs being lost from the Department of Work and Pensions, it is hard to see how it will be possible to sustain the level of advice, training and support that many people with disabilities and long-term illnesses will need in order to get back into work.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
