Not a particularly jolly subject for a Monday morning, admittedly, but something we'll all need to deal with at some point. And if it isn't you breathing your last, it's going to be someone you know or someone you love - leaving a big someone-shaped hole in your life. When you are grieving for someone close to you, your job can seem unimportant. But at some point, ready or not, you are going to have to return to work. And though getting back to the office and routine is a welcome distraction for some, what if you can't face the world - let alone your colleagues and your inbox? Grief, by nature, is unpredictable - but one thing's for sure, it will affect your ability to do your job. Most of the time we can keep a healthy distance between our professional and personal lives, but bereavement brings the two crashing together. \"Individuals may experience an inability to concentrate, a decline in performance, a lack of motivation and more physical symptoms such as tiredness and loss of appetite,\" says Denise Kantor Kaydar, from the bereavement charity Cruse. \"If you have lost someone close, you will need time off to arrange the funeral, visit relatives and make other practical arrangements. But it's also important to rest at this time, and ensure that you are fit for work.\" But what is considered an acceptable amount of time for emotional recovery - and do employers have a legal duty of care towards staff who have lost a loved one? The Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (DBERR, formerly the DTI) provides guidance to employers and their staff in this area. \"Employees are entitled to take a reasonable amount of time off work to deal with certain unexpected or sudden emergencies, such as the death of a dependant,\" says Gerry Millar, from DBERR. \"But this doesn't include an entitlement to pay.\" In practice, it is often is left up to the employer to determine what is reasonable. Most companies will offer a period of compassionate leave, paid or unpaid, on the death of a dependent (ie, spouse, parent, child, or someone living in the same household). But this can vary in length, and is only granted at the discretion of your line manager. So what can you do if you think your boss is not being understanding enough? First, remember you are under an obligation to inform your boss that you need time off as soon as possible. You should also give an idea of how long you think you will be away from work. If you've done things by the book and still think your boss is being unreasonable, you might have to look up your company's grievance procedures and set things in motion (though the added stress is unlikely to make the situation any better). Sarah Weeks's mother died suddenly from a heart attack last year, but she decided to go back to her job as a teacher after just one week. \"I wanted to take my mind off things and I thought I'd probably be better off at work,\" she says. \"But it was totally as if nothing had happened - my mum wasn't mentioned, I wasn't asked how I was, and I was given more work covering someone else's classes. \"When I did take a couple of days off sick I was made to feel bad, so I just decided to leave about six weeks later. The stress was terrible and it just wasn't worth it. They didn't want to know, the way they treated me was appalling, and I didn't have any respect for them any more.\" While an insensitive or uncaring manager can aggravate a bad situation, having understanding colleagues around you can make all the difference. And with welfare at work moving up the agenda for both managers and employees, more workplaces are taking a direct approach to employee wellbeing. A good employer may offer support ranging from flexible-working arrangements, employee assistance programmes (EAPs) and in-house support and advisory departments. Vaughan O'Grady's wife died two years ago from Hodgkin's disease, leaving him as the main carer for their disabled daughter. O'Grady, who works as an editor for Informa Telecommunications and Media, says he found his employer very supportive. \"I took six weeks' leave and during that time I got several emails asking how I was. I've been able to work flexibly and take my daughter to hospital appointments. Everyone has been very kind, they knew how much to ask, and how much not to ask. If they'd made my life difficult, been insensitive or more demanding, I would have left; I would have been exhausted.\" Dealing with such a sensitive situation requires employers to listen to their staff and look at each situation separately. Staff may feel traumatised by the break-up of a long-term relationship, for instance, or even the death of much-loved family pet. Blue Cross runs a free Pet Bereavement Support Service (PBSS) providing support for bereaved pet owners. According to a survey by the charity, 51% of pet owners take time off work to grieve. \"This result shows just how deeply losing a pet affects people, whether through death or separation. They are effectively losing one of their family,\" says Margot Clarke, coordinator of the PBSS. Rosemary, a manager at a children's charity, found things hard after splitting up with her long-term partner of 10 years - and was worried about maintaining a sense of composure and professionalism in front of her team. \"Inside I felt like a zombie, totally not there,\" she says. \"I didn't want to be at work at all, but I put on this cheery front which was agony to keep up at times. My eyes would well up with no warning and I kept having to go the loo to get myself together. I didn't tell anyone about it, and there was no one to really confide in except my director, but I didn't want it to look like I wasn't coping.\" Bosses should try to be sympathetic to the effects of bereavement on an employee. \"Managers should ask how they wish to be treated and respect their wishes, taking into account any religious considerations,\" says Denise Kantor Kaydar from Cruse. \"Don't be afraid to mention the death, and check in now and again to make sure they're OK. Warning signs that someone is not coping include a change in behaviour and weight loss.\" www.cruse.org.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
