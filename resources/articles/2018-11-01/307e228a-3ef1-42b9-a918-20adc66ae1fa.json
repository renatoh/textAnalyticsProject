Thanks for reading. Top national security aide Mira Ricardel may or not be fired after First Lady Melania Trump called for her ouster. Robert Mueller\u2019s investigators are asking questions about Nigel Farage. CNN is suing the Trump Administration over the revocation of Jim Acosta\u2019s White House pass A Republican congressman from Maine is seeking to overturn the state\u2019s voter approved ranked choice voting system because it might cost him his seat. Turnout among Latinos was \u201chistoric\u201d \u2013 and a record number of Latinos are headed to Congress, according to the congressman who oversaw the Democrats\u2019 plan to take back the House. \u201cLatino voters played a pivotal role in taking back the House,\u201d DCCC chairman Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n said on a conference call hosted by Latino Victory Fund. He said the Latino vote was especially consequential in a handful of House races across demographically diverse Sun Belt battlegrounds of Nevada, Arizona, Florida and Texas. Luj\u00e1n, whose oversaw the 2018 House battlefield and is the first Latino to serve in the role, attributed the high turnout among the Democratic base \u2013 which includes Latinos, millennials, African Americans, Asians and women \u2013 to an \u201cunprecedented\u201d $30m investment. \u201cLatinos showed up to the polls because we talked to them, we listened to them, our candidates connected with their personal stories, we knocked on their doors and we reached out to them online,\u201d he said. As Donald Trump roiled his base with warnings of a migrant caravan and gang violence, Dan Sena, the DCCC executive director and the first Latino to helm the committee, said the group honed in on a positive message \u2013 trying to create an environment in which Latinos had something to vote for rather than against. \u201cWe wanted voting to feel good rather than simply what is at stake and kids in cages and Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we spent a fair amount of time really studying how to create urgency without making it feel overly heavy and overly sad.\u201d Sena added that the strength of the Latino vote is no longer a hypothetical.\u201d The proof is in the pudding,\u201d he said, that investing in communities of color is \u201cnecessary to the longterm success of the party\u201d. In 2018, Latinos voted overwhelmingly for Democrats by a margin of nearly 3 to 1, according to Matt Barreto, co-founder of Latino Decisions. His polling found that 73% of Latinos voted for Democratic candidates while only 23% voted for Republicans. Barreto said Latinos identified healthcare as the most important issue followed by the divisive rhetoric around immigration. Latino voters said they were \u201ctired of the discussion of immigrants in such a negative and racist,\u201d which Barreto said is how the respondents characterized the commentary from Trump and Republicans. Crist\u00f3bal Alex, the president of Latino Victory Fund, said he was \u201ctaken aback\u201d by how \u201cvile and racist\u201d the Republican attack ads were at the end of the campaign. But he believes the result of 2018 midterm elections \u2013 with Democrats reclaiming the House and winning senate seats in Arizona and Nevada \u2013 showed that this approach was unsuccessful. \u201cThey were right in one respect: there was a caravan that showed up on election day \u2013 that showed up at voting booths across the country with Democrats turning out in historic numbers proving that their attempt failed,\u201d he said. In an interview with the Associated Press, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg said he\u2019ll make a decision on a presidential bid in the coming months. \u201cI think January, February would be about as late as you can do it and as early as you can gather enough information,\u201d said Bloomberg. Bloomberg spent $110m to help Democrats during the midterms, a figure that represents a mere fraction of the billionaire\u2019s net worth of over $40bn. President Donald Trump appears to have committed a gaffe in the White House celebration of Diwali today. Although he mentioned its origins as the Hindu Festival of Lights, he neglected to mention that it is celebrated by Hindus several times on Twitter until finally getting it right For those following leadership races in the new Democratic majority, there\u2019s one less bit of drama to worry about as Steny Hoyer has locked down more than enough support to return as majority leader in 2019. Politico is reporting that one possibility to replace Kirstjen Nielsen at the Department of Homeland Security is Tom Homan, the former director of ICE. CNBC is now reporting that the Wall Street Journal story was wrong and that Ricardel is still a White House employee since this saga couldn\u2019t get any weirder. An hour after Melania Trump called for the sacking of deputy national security advisor Mira Ricardel, the White House aide has been fired. The Wall Street Journal reports she was escorted out of the White House minutes ago. Only two hours before her dismissal, she attended a White House Diwali ceremony with Trump. There\u2019s no winner expected today in Georgia\u2019s 7th congressional district. Results won\u2019t be certified in an unexpectedly tight congressional race, leaving suspense to continue later in the week. John Kasich will be in New Hampshire this week. The Ohio governor, vocal Trump critic and 2016 presidential candidate will be in the Granite State \u201cmeeting with old and new supporters\u201d according to a release. Kasich is holding three public events on Thursday, two in Manchester and one in Concord. Steve King is also the subject of a searing op-ed in the New York Times, which is unsurprising. Its author though is Adam Rubenstein, the deputy opinion editor at the Weekly Standard. Rubenstein went to Iowa to report on King and recorded the congressman obliquely comparing immigrants to dirt. At the day\u2019s next event, in Webster City, Mr. King opened by telling supporters about his recent pheasant hunting trip. He spoke of a pheasant noodle soup that he makes, and the jalape\u00f1o peppers he grows and puts in the soup to give it a kick. Then the conversation turned: Mr. King: \u201cI guess I\u2019m going to have to go and get some dirt from Mexico to grow the next batch.\u201d He and the audience laugh together. Audience member: \u201cTrust me, it\u2019s on its way.\u201d Mr. King: \u201cWell, yeah, there\u2019s plenty of dirt, it\u2019s coming from the West Coast, too. And a lot of other places, besides. This is the most dirt we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d King retaliated and blocked Rubenstein from his election night event and labeled the conservative opinion journal \u201cantifa news\u201d on Twitter. Iowa governor Kim Reynolds has issued a pointed rebuke to Steve King, the controversial Republican congressman from her state who has repeatedly praised white nationalists. Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Reynolds said: \u201cI think that Steve King needs to make a decision if he wants to represent the people and the values of the fourth district or do something else, and I think he needs to take a look at that.\u201d The statement comes after Reynolds didn\u2019t criticize King during her tight election against Democrat Fred Hubbell. King served as her campaign co-chair and they appeared together in an election-eve rally in north-west Iowa. However, Reynolds ran for ahead of the controversial King who only scrapped by a four point victory in a deep red congressional district. Her comments are a clear indicator that now that the election is over, fellow Iowa Republicans are ready to throw King under the bus ahead of 2020. The reason that Melania Trump wants top national security aide Mira Ricardel fired apparently doesn\u2019t have anything to do with policy. Instead, it is about a dispute over plane seating when the first lady visited Africa last month. Reuters has fleshed out some of the details as well: One of the sources said that their dealings over the trip \u201cdidn\u2019t go well\u201d. The other source said that Melania Trump felt that Ricardel tried to short-change the first lady in terms of US government resources allocated to support her Africa tour. Needless to say, while first ladies have clashed with White House staffers \u2013 most famously Nancy Reagan had a poisonous relationship with White House chief of staff Donald Regan \u2013 there is no precedent for the wife of the president to call on her husband to fire a staffer. In the ever normal world of Florida politics, Senator Bill Nelson has called for Governor Rick Scott to remove himself entirely from the recount process. Scott currently has a narrow lead over Nelson in the state\u2019s contested Senate race. Melania Trump has called for Mira Ricardel, a top aide to John Bolton, to be fired. This is a rare public intervention by the first lady into the functioning of the administration. In a statement to ABC News, Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Trump, said: \u201cIt is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House.\u201d Ricardel has long been at odds with the defense secretary, James Mattis. The veteran of the George W Bush administration had previously served in Trump\u2019s commerce department before being appointed deputy national security Adviser by Bolton when he succeeded HR McMaster. Donald Trump announced at a White House Diwali ceremony today that he has nominated Neomi Rao to replace Brett Kavanaugh on the DC circuit court of appeals. Rao, a former clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, currently runs the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which helps to draft federal regulations. Mark Sanford, who lost the primary for his House seat in South Carolina for being insufficiently loyal to Donald Trump, has written an op-ed in the New York Times about the experience and what the GOP should learn from the midterms. His primary opponent, Katie Arrington, went on to lose the general election to Democrat Joe Cunningham in what was considered a relatively safe Republican district. Sanford argues: Republicans got a wake-up call last week. But will we wake up? My party would be wise to take a step back from President Trump\u2019s approach to politics. We should renew our commitment to tenets like environmental conservation and financial responsibility. We should run from the president\u2019s zero-sum approach to politics. One freshman member of Congress doesn\u2019t seem to be showing up in Washington. Brenda Jones, who won the special election to succeed John Conyers in Michigan\u2019s 13th congressional district, has yet to appear in Washington and will not be sworn in today. The problem is that while Jones won the special election, she didn\u2019t win the regular one. Instead, Rashida Tlaib won. The Muslim-American woman took advantage of a far more splintered field while only four African American candidates ran in the special, there were six in the general in the majority black district which led to the split decision. If she gets sworn in for a six-week-term in Congress, Jones would have to resign her position on Detroit\u2019s city council. The special election had been long delayed. The result is that that congressional district may go over a year without any representation in Congress. Sixteen-year-olds may vote in the 2020 presidential election. Under legislation that looks likely to pass the Washington DC city council, the franchise would be extended to 16- and 17-year-olds. Although minors are allowed to vote some municipal elections, this bill would be the first to allow them to vote in federal elections. Under the 26th amendment, no one over the age of 18 can be denied the ability to vote because of their age, there is no lower limit. If passed, the legislation is unlikely to change the results of DC\u2019s three electoral votes. Hillary Clinton won the District in 2016 by a margin of 91%-4%. The federal investigation of Bernie Sanders\u2019s wife Jane and her stewardship of a failed Vermont college has apparently ended. This clears one potential obstacle for Sanders mounting a presidential bid in 2020. Prosecutors for Robert Mueller have asked about Nigel Farage in the Russia investigation. Jon Swaine and Stephanie Kirchgaessner report for the Guardian that Jerome Corsi, a Roger Stone associate who expects to be indicted, says he has been asked about Farage in the course of the investigation. The announcement yesterday that West Virginia state senator Richard Ojeda would mount a quixotic presidential campaign is an indication of another trend among Democrats \u2013 that many of their biggest stars in the 2018 election were losing candidates. Hanna Trudo at National Journal notes the interesting path forward for candidates who gained national attention but failed to receive enough votes at the ballot box. Democrats are vowing to scrutinize Trump\u2019s appointment of Matt Whitaker as acting attorney general once they formally take the majority in January. However, Republicans are far less concerned about Whitaker and comments that he made about the Mueller investigation prior to joining the justice department last year. A Trump administration official has been indicted in Alabama for violating state ethics laws. Trey Glenn, the south-east regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), has been indicted for incidents dating to before his tenure in the administration when he worked to block EPA efforts to clean up a Birmingham neighborhood. As rumors surrounding the future of John Kelly as chief of staff swirl, one possible contender for the job is ruling himself out. OMB head Mick Mulvaney is now telling people that he is not interested in the position. The lame duck session of Congress will begin today with three new members of the House of Representatives. All three won both special elections last week. Representative-elect Kevin Hern, (R-OK), Oklahoma\u2019s first congressional district Representative-elect Joe Morelle (D-NY), New York\u2019s 25th congressional district Representative-elect Mary Gay Scanlon (D-PA), Pennsylvania\u2019s seventh congressional district Gwinnett county, Georgia will begin counting provisional ballots this afternoon. There are 2,400 to 2,500 outstanding ballots in the suburban Atlanta county including 1,500 in Georgia\u2019s seventh congressional district a race that has yet to be called. Incumbent Rob Woodall currently leads Democrat Carolyn Bourdeaux by 900 votes in the race. One of the biggest upsets on election night was the victory of Democrat Max Rose in New York\u2019s 11th congressional district comprising Staten Island and part of Brooklyn. Ginia Bellafante for the New York Times captures some of the political and cultural reasons behind his win. Mira Ricardel, a top aide to John Bolton, is reported on the way out according to the Wall Street Journal. Ricardel joins the homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, as well as potentially chief of staff John Kelly on the chopping block. The president has now weighed in on the recount process in Florida. The effect that Donald Trump has had on American politics was made clear last week when Democrats won a number of districts that had been gerrymandered to be Republican. By upending traditional coalitions, the president turned safe districts drawn for suburban Republicans blue. In Illinois, Democrats won two House seats drawn for Republicans. However, Republicans held on to a rural downstate seat drawn in 2010 for a Democrat. At least nine House candidates attending new member orientation in Washington DC haven\u2019t officially won their races and several are not considered likely to win. Things are getting off to an interesting start on Capitol Hill where Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is participating in a sit-in in the office of Nancy Pelosi to demand \u201ca Green New Deal\u201d. The protest, which is led by two groups, Justice Democrats and Sunrise Movement , bashes Pelosi for \u201cher intention to promote a \u2018bipartisan marketplace of ideas\u2019 and re-launch a toothless special committee from 2007 on climate change which resulted in weak cap-and-trade legislation passing the House in 2009 before failing in the Democratic-controlled Senate\u201d. The cap and trade bill barely passed the House by a margin of 219-212 and didn\u2019t receive a vote in the Senate. The vote was considered politically toxic by many Democrats and help contribute to a number of them losing their seats in the midterms. There is more reporting on a shakeup within the Trump administration. ABC News is reporting that Trump is considering Nick Ayres, the current chief of staff to Vice-President Mike Pence, as a replacement for John Kelly. The White House has issued a statement on the CNN lawsuit: \u201cWe have been advised that CNN has filed a complaint challenging the suspension of Jim Acosta\u2019s hard pass. This is just more grandstanding from CNN, and we will vigorously defend against this lawsuit. CNN, who has nearly 50 additional hard pass holders, and Mr. Acosta is no more or less special than any other media outlet or reporter with respect to the First Amendment. After Mr. Acosta asked the President two questions\u2014each of which the President answered\u2014he physically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern, so that other reporters might ask their questions. This was not the first time this reporter has inappropriately refused to yield to other reporters. The White House cannot run an orderly and fair press conference when a reporter acts this way, which is neither appropriate nor professional. The First Amendment is not served when a single reporter, of more than 150 present, attempts to monopolize the floor. If there is no check on this type of behavior it impedes the ability of the President, the White House staff, and members of the media to conduct business.\u201d Forget 2020, the 2019 elections are already happening. The off-year will see three states, Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi, holding gubernatorial elections. In Kentucky, Democrat Rocky Adkins is already preparing to challenge incumbent Republican Matt Bevin. Adkins, the House minority leader in the Kentucky House of Representatives, will face state attorney general Andy Beshear in the state\u2019s primary election. Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown is contemplating a 2020 presidential bid after winning his re-election bid last week. His opponent, Republican Jim Renacci, is not happy about it. The congressman has been complaining on Facebook. Newly elected senators are already getting temporary offices set up in the Capitol less than one full week after the midterms. Bruce Poliquin, a Republican congressman from Maine, is suing to invalidate the state\u2019s ranked choice election law. A law approved twice via referendum in Maine allows voters to rank their choices for office. If no candidate receives 50%, voters\u2019 second choice is then counted. Poliquin currently has a narrow lead over Democrat Jared Golden by a margin of 46.2% to 45.5%. However, 8% of the vote went to left-leaning independent candidates and the expectation is that most of those voters had Golden as their second choice. The lawsuit seeks to prevent the second choice ballots from being counted, which would make Poliquin the winner. Another Mueller indictment is apparently coming. Jerome Corsi, a conspiracy theorist who played a key role is pushing attacks on John Kerry\u2019s war service in 2004, said he expects to be indicted. Corsi insisted in a online broadcast Monday that he was the victim of \u201ca perjury trap\u201d. There are issues in Florida outside of Broward county. In Bay county, located in the state\u2019s panhandle, 147 ballots were returned via email. This is in violation of state law. The county was badly damaged by Hurricane Michael. Trump\u2019s private schedule doesn\u2019t just have \u201cexecutive time\u201d any more. Apparently, \u201cpolicy time\u201d has been added as well. Olivier Knox, the president of the White House Correspondents Association, has issued a statement on the lawsuit. The White House Correspondents\u2019 Association strongly supports CNN\u2019s goal of seeing their correspondent regain a US Secret Service security credential that the White House should not have taken away in the first place. Revoking access to the White House complex amounted to disproportionate reaction to the events of last Wednesday. We continue to urge the Administration to reverse course and fully reinstate CNN\u2019s correspondent. The President of the United States should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover him. The lawsuit filed by CNN and Jim Acosta is now posted online. You can read it here. A new poll of potential Democratic candidates in 2020 shows a splintered field with no candidate getting more than a quarter of the vote. The poll from Morning Consult and Politico shows Joe Biden leading the pack at 26%, Bernie Sanders second at 19% and Beto O\u2019Rourke in third place at 8%. The poll shows how divided Democrats are nationally without any clear frontrunner. CNN is suing the Trump administration over the revocation of reporter Jim Acosta\u2019s White House pass. The lawsuit comes a week after Acosta was banned and the White House used a doctored video to justify this. On Monday night, Amy Totenberg, a federal judge in the northern district of Georgia, ruled that the state\u2019s election results cannot be certified before Friday. The order was prompted by a lawsuit brought by the non-profit Common Cause to ensure that provisional ballots would be counted in the Peach state. Georgia election officials had been preparing to certify the results of the race as early as Wednesday, six days before the deadline to do so. There may be another shakeup in the Trump administration. The Washington Post reports that Trump is preparing to fire Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary. Trump has long been unhappy with Nielsen, a close ally of the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, who was her predecessor at DHS. However, dismissing her now would force confirmation battles for two key law enforcement positions in the next Senate with the attorney general vacancy as well. Monday night, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema was declared the winner in Arizona\u2019s Senate race. Sinema bested Republican Martha McSally in a tight race between two female members of Congress. Her win also is the second Senate seat picked up by Democrats in the 2018 midterms after Jacky Rosen bested incumbent Republican Dean Heller in Nevada. So far, Republicans have picked up three Senate seats in Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota and are leading in Florida. Good morning. Arizona has a new senator, Florida still is in the middle of a recount and Donald Trump is angry at France. It\u2019s Tuesday in American politics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
