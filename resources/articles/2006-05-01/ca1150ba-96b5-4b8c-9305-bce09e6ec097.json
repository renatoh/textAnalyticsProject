He had been in poor health for some time. Alec, a seamer who was capped 51 times, and Eric, a spinner, made their first-class debuts in the same match for Surrey in June 1939. Eric played a season longer before retiring in 1961, topped 1,000 runs in a season six times and took more than 800 wickets. The twins served in the second world war together ran a stationery company, Straker Ryman, and shared a bungalow in Woking. Their final appearance at a Test match together was at The Oval last summer for the fifth Test against Australia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
