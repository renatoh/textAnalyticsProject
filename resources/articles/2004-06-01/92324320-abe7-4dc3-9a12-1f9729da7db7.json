The action filed in New York yesterday by US class action lawyer Ed Fagan accuses six major firms, including IBM, Anglo American, Fluor Corporation and UBS, of conspiring and aiding and abetting genocide. The action demands that South Africa and the companies pay $20bn into a 'humanitarian fund'. 'This is a quarter of what the Germans paid for the Nazi atrocities and Germany was not as wealthy a country,' said Fagan in New York this weekend. The action names the South African President Thabo Mbeki, and accuses him of 'interfering with plaintiffs' efforts to seek justice' and 'making secret deals' with companies to frustrate bereaved families in their quest for damages. The action also singled out the post- apartheid regime for ensuring that named multinationals could never be prosecuted in South Africa. One plaintiff is Dorothy Molefi, the mother of 13-year-old Hector Pietersen, who was shot dead by police at Soweto and whose dead body provided one of the most powerful images of the apartheid era. IBM is accused of 'designing, marketing and managing' computer systems that helped the state control the majority black population. All the companies deny liability and are believed to be contesting the action."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
