The norm-shattering president finally became too much for Republican politicians when he threatened to do something else entirely \u2013 impose tariffs on Mexican imports. On Tuesday, Republican senators emerged enraged from a meeting with Trump, unwilling to stomach his threat to level tariffs as high as 25% on Mexican goods in retaliation for migrants crossing the border. Even Senator Ted Cruz, the former Trump punching-bag (\u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d) who has since become a reliable Trump ally, railed against the proposed tariffs, calling them \u201cnew taxes\u201d on Texas farmers, manufacturers and small businesses. Otherwise spineless Republican senators are having this change of heart because of an important political reality: tariffs will make goods more expensive in the states they need to capture in 2020. Like Texas, Michigan would be hit hard by a trade war. Thanks to the automobile industry\u2019s complex supply chains, it is the state most dependent on imports from Mexico \u2013 and, as Republicans know all too well, crucial to Trump\u2019s re-election prospects. He is already running 12 points behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders there, according to one recent poll. Trump\u2019s ongoing trade war with China has cost him political capital throughout the midwest, where farmers depend on imports and exports. His approval rating in Iowa has dropped a staggering 21 points since he took office. In Wisconsin, he\u2019s lost 19 points, and in Ohio, 18. Trump\u2019s base alone cannot carry him, especially with so many Democrats motivated to drive him out of office. This is the only kind of math Republican lawmakers understand, because it speaks to their survival. The most ravenous Republicans will never desert Trump, and his approval rating among party regulars remains strong, but his 2016 success hinged on razor-thin margins in a handful of midwestern states. There is no path to victory without them. Conservatives beyond the cult of Trump comprehend this \u2013 that their dear leader is not infallible, that his 30-year obsession with combating trade deficits could be his undoing. Trump, more through instinct than any kind of sober economic analysis, has long understood that the free-trade agreements of the 1990s hastened globalization, punished the American worker, and allowed jobs to flee elsewhere. He violated the GOP\u2019s orthodoxy on free trade and still commandingly won a primary. He knew tacking left on trade wasn\u2019t going to cost him votes. But Trump\u2019s hatred of a globalized world that would cheapen the value of labor is not tied up in any defense of the American worker. If it were, he would embrace strong labor unions, consumer protections, universal healthcare and cheap housing for America\u2019s precarious working class. He rejects actual uplift in favor of lashing out at allies and trading partners around the globe, a jingoistic braying with no true endgame. He says his Mexican tariffs will begin on Monday. And then what? If Trump doesn\u2019t get the immigration concessions from Mexico that he wants, and overrides Republican opposition to impose tariffs starting at 5% on imports, how far will Republicans in Congress go to oppose him? So far, they have been the most pliant class of lawmakers in recent history, tolerating his rank incompetence in the hope he implements enough of the conservative agenda to set Democrats back a generation. Denying science or catering to white supremacists was not enough to foment any kind of rebellion among Republicans in Congress \u2013 they, too, reject the reality of climate change and refuse to ostracize the most hateful elements of their base \u2013 but tariffs could do the trick, if only because they pose an electoral challenge for Trump 2020. There is no Trump economic policy or Trump government as much as the man himself, executing ill-informed policy on instinct. Dissenting voices have been excised. How far Trump goes with his tariffs will be up to Trump. If Trump is defeated next year, it will be because of Trump \u2013 his motives, his decisions, his rage. It\u2019s Trump\u2019s trade war. We\u2019re just the casualties. \u2022 Ross Barkan is a writer and journalist in New York City"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
