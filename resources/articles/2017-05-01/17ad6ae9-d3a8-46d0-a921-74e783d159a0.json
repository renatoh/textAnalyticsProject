For one thing, it\u2019s not even called that any more. As part of its \u201cThink Big\u201d rebranding theme, the world\u2019s biggest mining company opted to shed the Billiton moniker it acquired in a 2001 merger with a Dutch-South African company and revert to its previous true-blue Aussie name. BHP says the rebranding \u2013 complete with TV ads about how seven ordinary blokes in the outback founded what is now a global business worth $A94bn (\u00a354bn) \u2013 is part of a long-term plan started 18 months ago to reconnect with communities. \u201cThe timing now is good but we don\u2019t look at it as an event,\u201d the company\u2019s chief external affairs officer, Geoff Healy, says. \u201cThis is a clean brand change for the company.\u201d The move appeared to bookend a happy period when the Anglo-Australian mining colossus had rediscovered its direction after 19 people were killed in a disastrous dam burst at an iron ore joint venture in Brazil in 2015 and the share price sank to a 10-year low. But no sooner had BHP put the finishing touches to its fresh look on Monday than it found itself, for the second time in a month, the subject of an unflattering critique by a predatory US hedge fund. Upsetting BHP\u2019s big week was Elliott Advisors, whose Arsenal-supporting billionaire founder, Paul Singer, has earned a fearsome reputation for pursuing change at companies he thinks could make him more money. In April, Elliott wrote to investors demanding that BHP spin off its US oil assets and abolish its \u201cobsolete\u201d corporate structure that means it is listed in the UK and Australia. This week it adopted a more acrimonious tone, sledging BHP\u2019s management for \u201cchronic underperformance\u201d, adopting a \u201cdo nothing\u201d approach and destroying shareholder value to the tune of billions of dollars. BHP has yet to comment but its new image could appeal to the patriotism of its many small Australian shareholders and help rebuff Elliott\u2019s increasingly threatening advances. By evoking the company\u2019s gritty origins as Broken Hill Proprietary in remote New South Wales, BHP may have claimed to be thinking big but in reality is going back to basics. Even the Australian treasurer, Scott Morrison, got in on the act last week when he dismissed Elliott\u2019s initial suggestions about removing BHP from the Australian stock market as \u201cunthinkable\u201d. For good measure he added that taking the \u201coriginal big Australian\u201d offshore could lead to legal action against executives as it would contravene the terms of the 2001 merger. Morrison\u2019s comments were telling and reveal that Elliott, which once seized an Argentinian warship to extract debt repayment from the Buenos Aires government, may have underestimated the attachment Australians feel towards its corporate champions. While people in the UK are used to seeing companies and utilities bought and sold to the highest bidder \u2013 Cadbury, ICI, British Steel and Jaguar Land Rover have all disappeared or gone into foreign hands \u2013 Australians appear more attached to their big names, especially ones worth billions and which have paid handsome dividends to shareholders and pension funds down the years. Richard Knights of the London-based investment banking and share brokerage firm Liberum Capital says Elliott had misjudged the likely political fallout from its proposal that BHP drop its stock market listing in Australia. \u201cI don\u2019t think they quite grasped how much part of the corporate fabric of Australia BHP is. It has a lot of mum and dad shareholders, a lot of pension money and retirement savings. It\u2019s a different culture to [the UK], where someone else manages your money. There\u2019s more of a direct investment culture so there\u2019s a cultural angle that they missed.\u201d He adds that the mining giant\u2019s rebranding was also a factor. \u201cI think it ties into this whole cultural heritage,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause they spun off most of the Billiton assets so what\u2019s left is mostly BHP.\u201d While the finer points of brand awareness might not be a core consideration for a business that is focused on digging millions of tonnes of iron ore, coal and copper out of the ground, the significance is not lost on industry experts. Andrew Holt, the chief executive in Australia of the creative agency VCCP, says the \u201cThink Big\u201d campaign showed BHP was going back to its roots in order to restore its \u201cAustralian-ness\u201d. \u201cThat would seem a timely argument if you\u2019re trying to fight off a foreign investor,\u201d he says. Elliott did admit this week that amid all the discussion of \u201cunderperformance\u201d and \u201cunlocking optimal shareholder value\u201d, there was a cultural dimension to the number-crunching. \u201cWe understood from the start that unification requires BHP to cut through certain complexity and that Australians in particular feel passionate about BHP remaining rooted in Australia,\u201d the hedge fund said. Elliott is promising to fight on. Its latest missive backtracked on scrapping the dual UK-Australia listing but it remains belligerent, claiming that BHP\u2019s purchase of the US shale interests have cost shareholders US$23bn. So although BHP\u2019s CEO, Andrew Mackenzie, has said he would consider selling the US shale oil business for the right price and met representatives of Elliott in Barcelona on Wednesday, it is unlikely the activist fund, which claims to speak for 4.1% of shareholders, will go quietly. Ric Spooner, the chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, says many shareholders agreed with Elliott that BHP would be better off selling the US oil business and reinvesting the proceeds in other parts of the company. \u201cThe problem is BHP management has a dissenting view,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t agree that they would be better off by selling the oil assets. BHP believes that the advantage of oil is that it allows diversification and that it does well when other commodities do badly.\u201d Investec analyst Hunter Hillcoat says: \u201cIn our view, BHP\u2019s \u2018chronic underperformance\u2019 is not as chronic as Elliott makes out and some aspects of the Elliott presentation appear disingenuous and/or made with the benefit of hindsight. \u201cWhile BHP has certainly made poor investments, in our view it has been no worse than its peers in this regard.\u201d He admits there might be some merit in BHP selling its petroleum business, adding that the dispute could ultimately work in shareholders\u2019 favour, even if BHP makes no major concessions. \u201cWhatever the outcome, Elliott\u2019s agitation should be good for BHP shareholders, in our view, if only to create greater transparency.\u201d And that could be a big plus at the end of the week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
