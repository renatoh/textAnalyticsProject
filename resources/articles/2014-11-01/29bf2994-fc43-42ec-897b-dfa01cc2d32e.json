According to popular pre-season predictions neither manager was supposed to still be in post but instead Allardyce\u2019s reinvented West Ham United host Newcastle with European qualification a realistic mutual aim. The match will be spiced by assorted sub-plots. While Allardyce once managed at St James\u2019 Park, Pardew led West Ham to the FA Cup final. Then there\u2019s the presence of the Newcastle old boys Andy Carroll \u2013 a striker much coveted by the visiting manager \u2013 and Kevin Nolan in the Upton Park ranks. \u201cIt\u2019s a special game and should make for a great occasion,\u201d says Pardew whose rejuvenated team hope to record a sixth straight Premier League win and seventh in all competitions. \u201cI have a lot of love for West Ham and their fans. They can be quite cutting down there but, generally, they\u2019re brilliant.\u201d There is little affection for Allardyce on Tyneside but Pardew does not share this negative consensus. \u201cSam knows what it takes to win in the Premier League and is adaptable,\u201d he says. \u201cI look forward to clashing swords with him because his teams always test you. He\u2019s taken West Ham forward this year in terms of their style of play. With the options Sam now has, they\u2019re in for a big season.\u201d Whereas Pardew has largely rebuilt Newcastle around a nucleus of academy graduates and existing players rather than his seven summer signings, the close season acquisition of several newcomers including Enner Valencia, Carl Jenkinson, Morgan Amalfitano and Aaron Cresswell has been pivotal to the upturn in Allardyce\u2019s fortunes. \u201cI think West Ham made, pound for pound, the best signings of any team in the summer,\u201d Pardew says. \u201cAlthough our new players have made an impact \u2013 particularly Jack Colback, Ayoze P\u00e9rez and Daryl Janmaat \u2013 our real strength this season has come from within, from Sammy Ameobi, Rolando Aarons and Paul Dummett, from guys who have pushed up a little notch.\u201d Newcastle\u2019s radical improvement does not prevent him casting an envious eye at Allardyce\u2019s recruits. \u201cWe were interested in Valencia, although not to the point where it got close. But West Ham\u2019s market is our market and all of those players are players we perhaps should have moved on because they\u2019ve done very well. That\u2019s testament to their scouting team and the manager for picking them off.\u201d If Newcastle\u2019s recent signings policy has left something to be desired, the team are, as Pardew puts it, \u201cin a very good place\u201d. \u201cI had a good run at Reading but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve ever done seven straight wins. We\u2019re on a kind of unique run and it\u2019s surprised even me. We look strong defensively [Newcastle have kept four successive clean sheets] and are an almost constant threat. \u201cI think the longevity of my contract \u2013 [Pardew signed a highly controversial eight-year deal in September 2012] \u2013 helps because these players know me and I know them. But Paul Dummett\u2019s been a big part of the run; he\u2019s come in at left-back, then centre-back and been fantastic.\u201d Whatever Saturday\u2019s result at Upton Park, recent events have made a nonsense of the calls for both his and Allardyce\u2019s heads. \u201cThe criticism you get as a Premier League manager is sometimes very harsh, very personal,\u201d Pardew says. \u201cYou have to be big enough to handle that. Even though you might not like it, you have to deal with it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
