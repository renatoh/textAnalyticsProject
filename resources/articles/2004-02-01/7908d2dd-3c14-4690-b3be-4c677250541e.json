Alan Rusbridger, the editor, told staff today that the decision has been taken not to follow the Independent and the Times who launched twin versions late last year. He said he could not disguise the fact that the Guardian's circulation had been hit by the launch of the tabloid rivals but felt that Sir Tony O'Reilly and Rupert Murdoch had made the decisions to publish twin editions of their titles for reasons which did not apply to the Guardian. \"The tabloid Independent and Times have shown that the format change can lead to a different type of journalism. Our key priority is to maintain the integrity of the Guardian's journalism, and we believe that will be achieved in the long-term through sustained editorial investment and remaining distinctive in an ever-converging newspaper market,\" he said. He also felt the economic risks were huge - it is estimated that the Times will spend \u00a312m to \u00a315m in its first year producing and marketing twin editions. \"We're still in the phoney war stage, with millions being ploughed into marketing a dual strategy which is, ultimately, unaffordable. No one I know believes that the Independent intends to keep publishing in two sizes. It will drop the broadsheet as soon as it can - and the Times is also trying to push its readers towards the tabloid. \"The Independent's a better tabloid than it was a broadsheet. I don't think the same would be true of the Guardian. We won't go down the me-too route. We'll do something distinctive in our own time,\" Rusbridger added. The decision comes after months of research and design which involved reader surveys and the production of a tabloid dummy. Both the Times and the Independent have added readers since launching a tabloid. But there is a widespread feeling that the Independent, which has struggled to get substantial amounts of new readers, had nothing to lose by bringing out a commuter-friendly edition. And Mr Murdoch has already admitted that he has harboured ambitions to go tabloid since he bought the Times in 1981, and many feel that with his passion for tabloids he is more comfortable occupying a mid-market. He said he had delayed the launch because he would have been accused of \"debasing\" journalism in Britain if he pioneered the new format for a broadsheet. \"I'm glad the Independent has gone ahead because now we can try to do it without any problems,\" he said when the Times announced the launch of its tabloid in November. Monthly circulation figures released today showed the circulation of the Independent and the Times continuing to rise thanks to their tabloid editions, denting the circulation growth of the Daily Telegraph and the Guardian. Overall circulation of the Independent climbed 4.65% month on month in January. It is now selling 248,876, with a sizeable chunk of households - 35% - buying the tabloid edition. The tabloid paper is available nationwide and this week the Independent ditched its broadsheet edition altogether in Wales, Scotland, Ireland and south-west England. The Times's circulation grew 3.83% month on month to 660,713, although it fell 7.02% in the six months to January, unlike the Independent which saw a 4.6% rise in the equivalent period. Despite the large drop in year on year circulation figures, media analysts will seize on the month on month rise for the Times - its six-monthly circulation figure is around 635,000. Circulation of the Guardian, including giveaways and discounted copies, was up 2.16% month on month to 383,157, but down 3.84% in the six months to January, while the Telegraph was up only 0.35% month on month to 914,981 and down 5.36% half yearly. With a tabloid-only Saturday edition of the Independent launched on January 31, the proportion of tabloids sold compared to broadsheets is set to rise - the figures published today by the audit bureau of circulations only reflect Monday to Friday sales of the tabloids. But ultimately both publishers will \"switch off\" the broadsheet edition because it is too expensive to run both. Circulation may also be affected by the inevitable reduction in the amount of money newsagents are paid to stock the tabloid edition. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
