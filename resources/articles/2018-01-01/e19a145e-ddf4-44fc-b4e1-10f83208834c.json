It has not been an easy ride since but Saturday\u2019s 1-1 draw \u2013 which would have been so much more had Harry Kane not scored a barely deserved late equaliser to cancel out a header from Padraig Amond \u2013 can help permanently change the environment in which Flynn\u2019s team, who came within minutes of a return to non-league last season, operate. \u201cIt allows us to lay foundations for the future,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to improve the training ground \u2013 I would like a new pitch and we need a new building because the old one caught fire [earlier this month]. These kinds of thing are important and I\u2019m sure things will happen.\u201d Flynn estimated that Newport\u2019s Cup run has, to date, earned more than \u00a3700,000 for a club whose annual turnover is around \u00a32.2m. He said he \u201cnearly hid under the table\u201d when he saw Tottenham\u2019s starting XI, for which Mauricio Pochettino shuffled his pack but left little to chance with the inclusion of Kane among others, but Newport more than matched their Premier League opponents from start to finish. \u201cIt was scary but I was confident in what my players could do,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m glad they had the big names playing because it makes the result even sweeter.\u201d Pochettino said his players \u201cmissed a massive opportunity to show that we really want to win some trophies\u201d and admitted they were \u201cnot motivated to the same level as Newport\u201d. Other managers might perhaps have sought refuge in the excuse of a patchy, bobbly surface but Flynn clearly appreciated Pochettino\u2019s graciousness and said his players had taken Tottenham to the wire on merit. \u201cThe pitch didn\u2019t stop their passing movement, their style of play and quality,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way they handled the football was excellent but I thought we were the better team in the first half. I didn\u2019t want to sit back and just invite pressure. My boys weren\u2019t tired [in the second half], it was that Spurs were relentless. They kept going but my boys were brilliant\u201d \u2013 sufficiently brilliant to suggest the loss of that Wembley record is no foregone conclusion at all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
