NatCen Social Research has been asking over 3,000 British people about their views on a wide variety of topics since 1983. This year, the biggest changes in public opinion concern the welfare state. Benefits for the unemployed When asked if benefits were too high, 51% of respondents agreed, compared to 62% the previous year. The responses were collected in 2012, before the bedroom tax policy so NatCen researchers have suggested that attitudes may have changed even more since these responses were collected. Although this is the biggest softening in attitudes so far, it doesn't represent the highest level of support for benefits to the unemployed. In fact, looking at all three decades of data reveals a very different picture of how attitudes to welfare have changed. In 1993, in the wake of what was another historic UK recession, just 24% of respondents thought that benefits for the unemployed were too high - compared to 55% who believed they were \"too low and cause hardship\". Welfare priorities However, when asked about government spending on welfare, a very different pattern of attitudes emerges. When asked to complete the sentence \"It definitely/probably should be the government's responsibility to \u2026\" 83% of people continued \"\u2026 provide a decent standard of living for the unemployed\". Today, only 59% of people finish that sentence in the same way. What's more, benefits to the unemployed receive far lower levels of support when people are asked to choose between five different areas of welfare spending. Retirement pensions have been considered the highest priority for three decades - although the entrenchment of this as a British attitude was not always what it is today. In 1983, 64% of Britons surveyed considered retirement pensions to be a top priority for government spending which rose to 80% in 2005 as the country has aged. In 2012, 72% of respondents highlighted pensions as their preferred area of government spending, compared to 59% prioritising benefits for disabled people (the highest level of support since 2000 and noteworthy given these responses were collected while the UK was hosting the Paralympics), 35% for child benefits, 14% benefits for single parents and just 12% of people believing that extra spending should be allocated on benefits for the unemployed. 'Benefit cheats' and 'scroungers' The latest survey responses also show a slight reduction in frustration with benefit claimants. 54% of people said \"around here, most unemployed people could find a job if they really wanted one\" compared to 56% the previous year. The overall numbers however, remain very high: four out of five Brits believe \"large numbers of people these days falsely claim benefits\". Comparing this year to last will tell you a very different story about British attitudes to welfare than if you take a 30 year perspective. Overall, we've become more cynical about government spending on welfare and those who receive it but the public mood has started to shift recently, potentially in response to increased debate around cuts and austerity.
