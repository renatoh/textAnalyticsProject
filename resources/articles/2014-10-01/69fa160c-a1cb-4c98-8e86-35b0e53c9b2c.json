Hodgson suspects that part of the reason Raheem Sterling complained about feeling \u201ca bit tired\u201d on Saturday, two days after playing the first 45 minutes of the 5-0 win against San Marino, was because the 19-year-old was used to an extra day without training. The England manager has already angered Brendan Rodgers after Daniel Sturridge was injured on international duty last month, when Liverpool\u2019s normal policy is that he would not take part in a full session until three days after playing. Hodgson has always allowed players over the age of 30 to have two days of recovery if it suits them but he is not convinced it should apply when it comes to the younger members of his squad and he intends to speak to Rodgers about the Sterling issue. The player defended him being criticised for asking to be rested.\u201cExcuse me for being human,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cRaheem might say it is something that is becoming ingrained in him and that he felt the need to talk about being tired more than he would normally do,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cWe have never had any problems with that [Liverpool\u2019s policy] but I don\u2019t think there is a lot of medical evidence to support the two-day recovery so, if you want to, you might want to research that. \u201cCertainly the Germans who everyone admires so much, they don\u2019t do it, that is for certain. We did it from the start because we had people such as John Terry, Ashley Cole, Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard who I felt would be better off having an extra day. \u201cI would expect players not to take it for granted that there will be two-day recoveries but on the other hand it could easily be like this time when we did virtually nothing in terms of what I consider to be training the day after the San Marino game and only 40 minutes, including the warm-up, the day before the Estonia game, and that was at a fairly low-level intensity.\u201d Hodgson has been at pains to emphasise there is no serious problem between himself and Rodgers but there is plainly a difference of opinion \u2013 \u201cIf I have to give players two days off we won\u2019t train at all,\u201d he said before the San Marino game \u2013 and the issue is likely to resurface when England play Slovenia on 15 November and then Scotland three days later. \u201cI think I should speak to Brendan but it really is very simple and I am sure he understands the situation,\u201d Hodgson continued. \u201cHe [Sterling] has played a lot of games recently and it is the first year in the Champions League for Liverpool for a while, so the games have obviously been quite high-pressure games. Brendan has been talking about the pressures Raheem has been under and the fatigue that may have set in, so I am pretty sure he will be dealing with Raheem over the next month as he sees fair. \u201cOur record over my two and a half years has not been too bad in terms of looking after the players. We don\u2019t send them back injured very often, though it is going to happen from time to time, and I think that is because we do have a very good medical and fitness staff and we do try to consider these things. \u201cBut I thought there was a good question: am I the only one with that responsibility? Or does it have to be shared between club and country? I think it does.\u201d Hodgson went on to acclaim Wayne Rooney as England\u2019s captain prepares to join the small list of players who have won 100 caps for his country. Rooney\u2019s second-half winner in Tallinn has put him within one goal of equalling Jimmy Greaves\u2019s total of 44 for the national team and six off Sir Bobby Charlton\u2019s all-time record of 49, and he will reach his century of appearances against Slovenia. \u201cI said when I came into the job that I didn\u2019t know quite what to expect of him,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cMy knowledge of him was shaped by TV, radio and the newspapers but I have been surprised by him. He is a very different person than I thought \u2013 very driven, very professional \u2013 and since he has had the captaincy he has taken on even more responsibility. To get 100 caps for your country is some achievement because the competition you face for your shirt in England all the time should be enormous.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
