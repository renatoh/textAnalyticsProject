For all the complaining that came from many sections of Australian football when Graham Arnold was confirmed as the new Socceroos head coach before the 2018 World Cup, on the field Arnold\u2019s side has yet to miss a beat. As Australia\u2019s 2019 Asian Cup defence gets under way this weekend in Al Aim against Jordan, his record post-Russia is played four for three convincing wins and a draw. Undefeated, with 13 goals scored and only one conceded. Three clean sheets secured, five debuts handed out and ten different goal-scorers. Not too shabby. Sure, some perspective is needed and the likes of Kuwait, Lebanon and Oman are not exactly ripping up trees in world football. The only notable opponent of pedigree in the past four fixtures was South Korea in Brisbane, which ended in a 1-1 draw in a game where the Socceroos dominated. But Arnold\u2019s men can only play whoever is in front of them. And so far they have met each challenge well. Arnie has faced a mixture of bad luck and chance in his first six months in charge of the national team. Skipper Mile Jedinak retired and injury has robbed him of both arguably his best player \u2013 Aaron Mooy \u2013 and his most exciting young attacking talent \u2013 Daniel Arzani \u2013 for the Asian Cup. It appears likely that a hamstring complaint will deny him Mathew Leckie too. But the 55-year-old has got on with the job and spent little time complaining. Mark Milligan was handed the captaincy and Scottish winger Martin Boyle was quickly brought into the fold. The Hibernian forward\u2019s electric first cap, which featured two goals and an assist against Lebanon, delighted the faithful. Some even ventured hopefully that \u201cthe next Tim Cahill\u201d had finally arrived. Midfielder James Jeggo and winger Awer Mabil have also been introduced to add some pace and youth into the Socceroos set up. The result is that the Australian team looks relatively different to the one that struggled in Russia. Yes, the 4-3-3 formation remains \u2013 that breaks into a 4-2-3-1 at times \u2013 and the tactics are largely similar, but many of the personnel are fresh. The Socceroos will still rely heavily on the likes of Mat Ryan, Trent Sainsbury, Mark Milligan, Aziz Behich, Tom Rogic and Robbie Kruse. An intensive rehab regime has ensured that Andrew Nabbout\u2019s shoulder was repaired and he made the squad, while Tom Juric and Cahill were jettisoned. It is Arnold\u2019s mantra that it is not the strikers\u2019 sole job but every player\u2019s to ensure goals are scored, from all across the pitch. At this point Arnold\u2019s Jurgen Klopp-inspired Liverpool-esque model is working. But the phoney war ends now. Jordan, Syria and Palestine shouldn\u2019t present too stern an opposition in Group B, apart from the odd banana skin, but Korea, Japan, Iran and Saudi Arabia will in the later stages. Anything but a semi-final appearance for Arnold and the Socceroos will be branded a failure. No slip-ups will be tolerated. There\u2019s no denying Arnold is a starkly different operator compared to both of his predecessors. Van Marwijk\u2019s time was exceptionally brief and his mission circumspect. Ange Postecoglou was bolder tactically and grander in vision, but remained a more aloof character, both to his players and with the media. In contrast, the former Sydney FC boss is more hands-on and approachable. Arnold already has a strong bond with many of his players. He has coached nine of them before, five of whom he gave their professional debuts in club football. One, Sainsbury, is his son-in-law. Only a handful of the current Socceroos squad has not been coached before or against in the A-League by him. Arnold\u2019s personal manner has been embraced by both those familiar and unfamiliar. \u201cHe is very hands-on in his style of management,\u201d Jackson Irvine says. \u201cEveryone\u2019s responding well to it\u2026 I\u2019d never worked with Arnie before. The Kuwait camp was the first time we had met. \u201cBut we\u2019ve had a lot of conversations since, he\u2019s come to watch me play in England and he\u2019s been really great with me. He keeps in a lot of contact and likes to know how you\u2019re going all the time. I\u2019ve enjoyed it.\u201d Ryan was given his first taste of professional football by Arnold in 2010 at Central Coast Mariners as a teenager. \u201cAnge and Arnie are two different types of managers at the end of the day, they\u2019re going to have different styles. It\u2019s been great since Arnie\u2019s been involved,\u201d the goalkeeper says. \u201cThere\u2019s been subtle little changes since when I had him as a manager back at the Mariners days until now. He\u2019s just evolved on the enjoyment and the man-management side of things, just finding little things within those. The balance of thing just feels perfect within camp.\u201d With form and confidence high, Arnold\u2019s close-knit charges are aiming to make history in the UAE. No country has claimed back-to-back Asian crowns for 30 years. Do that and Arnold will have silenced his doubters for good."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
