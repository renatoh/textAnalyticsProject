Setting a deadline of 11 November when parliament returns, opposition leader Anthony Albanese said the \u201caged care, action now\u201d campaign would gather signatures from across the country calling for immediate funding to address a crisis in the sector. \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough for the government to be sitting on its hands while these cuts have been made, while even the money that was allocated hasn\u2019t been spent,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cThe truth is that this government has cut aged care funding, they slashed it while Scott Morrison was the treasurer of Australia. And the consequences are there for all to see.\u201d The new campaign comes after the royal commission into aged care released a scathing report into the sector on Thursday, calling for urgent funding for home care packages, action on chemical restraints used in nursing homes and the removal of disabled young people from aged care. Albanese said the report had highlighted \u201catrocious\u201d behaviour towards older Australians, and the government had been missing in action since the report was handed down on Thursday. While the minister for aged care, Richard Colbeck, faced criticism for refusing to commit extra funds to the overburdened system following the report\u2019s public released, Hunt on Sunday defended the government\u2019s response. He said the report went \u201cfurther than we expected\u201d and the Coalition would now consider and respond to the commission\u2019s interim findings. \u201cWe are responding to what is the most profound and serious review of aged care in Australia, in the commission\u2019s words, in four decades,\u201d Hunt told ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday. \u201cWe called this [royal commission] because we recognised that there were deep and serious challenges. The commission went further than we expected in the sense that it identified a nationwide challenge over multiple decades. It identified both a cultural and a governmental challenge, and so, we are responding, and there will be additional home care packages.\u201d When asked if he would commit to at least $2.5bn \u2013 the amount needed to address the home care wait list of 120,000 \u2013 Hunt said he would not pre-empt the figure. The inquiry pointed to 16,000 people who died last year while waiting for a home care package, with those needing the highest level of care waiting an average 22 months. Labor\u2019s shadow minister for aged care, Julie Collins, said that for every week that the government delayed action, 300 older Australians die without their home care package. \u201cIt is simply not good enough for the prime minister and minister Hunt to say, \u2018Oh, wait, we will do something in a few weeks\u2019,\u201d Collins said. \u201cOlder Australians sitting in that queue don\u2019t have weeks \u2013 the government must respond urgently. That\u2019s what our campaign is about.\u201d Hunt pointed to a decision made at Friday\u2019s council of Australian governments health council meeting to make medicine safety a new national priority as an example of the government responding \u201cin real time\u201d to concerns raised by the commission about the use of chemical restraints. The Coag resolution was an agreement to establish a baseline report on medicine use and safety to identify the prevalence of harm and misuse of medicines. Hunt said the government would be taking \u201cstronger action\u201d on the use of chemical restraints in response to the commission\u2019s findings, but would not detail what changes were under consideration. \u201cWe will be dealing with chemical restraints as one of the three priorities that they\u2019ve identified for a response right now,\u201d he said. Hunt also said the report had raised concern about ageism in Australia, which he said was a \u201cnational cultural issue\u201d that needed to be addressed by both government and the community. \u201cThe big change is to deal with what the commission refers to as an ageist society, and respect, and respect is both government and communal,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cThis is the line in the sand, together, where we change the way that Australians deal with ageing in what is, by definition, an ageing society.\u201d In response to a major report from the productivity commission this week on mental health, Hunt said the government\u2019s \u201cobjective\u201d was to build 100 adult mental health clinics over the next decade, with eight already under way costing $60m. But he said one of the biggest barriers to treatment was \u201cself stigma\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
