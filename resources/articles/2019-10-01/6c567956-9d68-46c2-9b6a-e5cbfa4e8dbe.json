They were made to work overtime against Group E leaders Croatia, with Gareth Bale cancelling out a ninth-minute opener by Nikola Vlasic in a bruising encounter punctuated by several wholehearted challenges, including an inauspicious first-half collision that left the Manchester United winger Daniel James in a heap. James went on to complete the match but Ethan Ampadu was not so fortunate five minutes into the second half, hobbling off after clashing with the Croatia forward Bruno Petkovic, who laid on Vlasic\u2019s opener. James said he was not knocked unconscious and his manager suggested the winger feigned injury, despite being grounded after being sandwiched by the Croatia pair Domagoj Vida and Borna Barisic, who flung themselves at a loose ball that James tried to head on out to the right flank. The ground fell silent and the referee Bjorn Kuipers immediately signalled for medical attention, which James received for almost three minutes. \u201cHe was compos mentis,\u201d Giggs said. \u201cWe did tests at half-time and he passed them. He stayed down, I say about players being smart and he was smart, he stayed down and he was fine. The physios came over and there was no problem. He stayed down, he was a bit streetwise, he told the doctors \u2018I\u2019m just not moving, I\u2019m just sitting still,\u2019 not to get anyone sent off but just using his nous. At half-time, he did and passed all of the concussion tests. He was fine.\u201d By the end it was a case of the walking wounded, with Bale succumbing to a spot of cramp, Ampadu forced off and the Croatia and Chelsea midfielder Mateo Kovacic nursing a knee injury sustained in the buildup to Wales\u2019 equaliser in the penultimate of four minutes of first-half stoppage-time. Ben Davies, on his 50th cap for his country, rampaged his way through like a rhino, nicking the ball away from Kovacic in the process before feeding Bale, who took a touch, steadied himself and then delivered the killer finish. \u201dWhen Gareth gets into those positions, he never lets you down,\u201d Giggs said. \u201cIt\u2019s just his composure \u2013 when he does get those chances, he puts them away.\u201d Croatia, World Cup finalists last year, are a point away from securing their place at next summer\u2019s finals, while Wales remain in a healthy position, despite qualification moving out of their hands. If Croatia beat Slovakia in Rijeka next month and Wales win their remaining matches against Azerbaijan and Hungary, Giggs\u2019s side will have done enough. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to win both games and rely on others, but we\u2019re in it,\u201d Giggs said. \u201cI wanted to be in it after these games. We\u2019ve shown our quality and concentration in these games.\u201d The only negative for Wales, who were again without Aaron Ramsey through injury, is that Joe Allen will miss the trip to Baku in November through suspension after picking up a yellow card here, though Joe Morrell, the Bristol City midfielder on loan at League One Lincoln City again impressed off the bench against a star-studded Croatia midfield trio of Luka Modric, Ivan Perisic and Ivan Rakitic, who replaced Kovacic at the interval. \u201cI thought he was fantastic \u2013 it is not easy coming into the centre-midfield against Croatia,\u201d Giggs said, smiling. \u201cWe\u2019ve got players who can come in and do a job.\u201d Arguably Croatia\u2019s standout performer was Josip Brekalo, who scored twice against England at the Under-21 European Championship in the summer. Brekalo was the catalyst for Vlasic\u2019s ninth-minute opener, with the Wolfsburg forward dancing down the left flank and bamboozling Tom Lockyer before passing the baton on to Petkovic, who fed Vlasic. The former Everton midfielder applied an economical finish that sneaked into the corner of Wayne Hennessey\u2019s goal via a post. Croatia, too, owing to cautions sustained here, will be bereft of key cogs Dejan Lovren and Vida through suspension when they meet Slovakia in a game that is ostensibly as crucial to Wales as it is to them next month. \u201cWe need to be more careful,\u201d conceded Zlatko Dalic, the Croatia head coach. \u201cWe started well, but we are not happy with the result.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
