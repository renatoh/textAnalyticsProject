But he only presents a partial picture. This Labour government has consistently and rightly opposed the US economic blockade of Cuba, voting against the US position most recently at the UN in December 2004. And we most certainly did not threaten Kenya with withdrawing financial support for an anti-Aids project if Kenya failed to oppose Cuba at the UN commission on human rights. Cuba is not the only country to be subjected to an annual resolution in Geneva. Last year there were resolutions condemning Burma, Belarus and North Korea. Indeed, every EU country is co-sponsoring the resolution on Cuba at the UN commission on human rights this year. While I support Cuba's right to self-determination, there are real concerns for example about prisoners locked up without adequate trials. We opposed that in Guant\u00e1namo Bay and we oppose it in Cuba. I was the first minister from an EU government to visit Cuba following the resumption of EU-Cuba diplomatic dialogue - something Gibson welcomed. In Cuba I was able to make clear to the Cuban government that we do not support the economic blockade. We do want to trade and engage politically with Cuba; but we will not shy away from protesting about human rights abuses when they occur in Cuba.
