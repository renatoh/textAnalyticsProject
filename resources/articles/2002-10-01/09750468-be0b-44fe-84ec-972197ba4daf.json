Showed safe hands near the finish to hold Nemeth's shot and was given no chance with the goal. One uncertain moment from a cross-shot, but rarely troubled. 6/10 Gary Neville Mins on pitch 90 Pass success 69% Goal attempts 2 ( On target 0) Tackles won 4 Solid defensive performance on his return in place of Danny Mills. Adopted a no-frills approach, particularly in the first half. Did not venture forward much and his link-up with Beckham was not at its best. 6/10 Jonathan Woodgate Mins on pitch 90 Pass success 86% Goal attempts 0 Tackles won 3 Struggled at times on the floor, notably when Nemeth beat him and got in a first-half shot. It was not hard to guess that he and Southgate have scarcely played together but made some decent contributions as England held on. 5/10 Gareth Southgate Mins on pitch 90 Pass success 74% Goal attempts 1 (1) Tackles won 3 Largely won his aerial battles but not his finest match. His longer distribution was unusually wayward and he, too, was embarrassed by Nemeth. Saw a first-half header saved and made a vital early tackle to deny Slovakia. 5/10 Ashley Cole Mins on pitch 90 Pass success 70% Goal attempts 0 Tackles won 4 Impressed with his defending, passing and willingness to go upfield. Offensively quiet to begin with but came forward more towards the interval and pushed up when possible in the second half. Got away with one error. 7/10 David Beckham Mins on pitch 90 Pass success 69% Goal attempts 4 (2) Tackles won 3 Had a particularly poor first hour and seemed to be getting agitated, lunging into tackles that might have brought a caution. But equalised with a free-kick and more settled after that. Only one notable trademark cross. 5/10 Nicky Butt Mins on pitch 90 Pass success 71% Goal attempts 1 (0) Tackles won 8 Began slowly, giving the ball away, but full of fight and had a better second half at the base of a midfield diamond. Used possession sensibly from there, won tackles and made a key late block to send a shot spinning off target. 6/10 Steven Gerrard Mins on pitch 77 Pass success 74% Goal attempts 2 (2) Tackles won 5 Never stopped working but well below his best. Defensively solid in the first half but too often wasted possession with inaccurate long passes. Moved to the left after the interval and looked tidier without shining. 5/10 Paul Scholes Mins on pitch 90 Pass success 71% Goal attempts 0 Tackles won 5 Flashes of skill before half-time but uncomfortable on the left and far too deep. Moved behind the front two and was influential in the comeback. Linked with the strikers and did well to cross for Owen's winner. 6/10 Michael Owen Mins on pitch 86 Pass success 70% Goal attempts 2 (1) Tackles won Scored the winning goal but largely struggled to impose himself on the match. Virtually anonymous in the first half with poor service. He wasted a good opening but was there when required to head the decisive strike. 6/10 Emile Heskey Mins on pitch 89 Pass success 74% Goal attempts 1 (1) Tackles won 4 Played too far apart from Owen at first, but was outstanding in second-half. Held the ball up, crossed from both flanks and set up two chances before playing a part in the winner. 7/10 Subs Kieron Dyer Mins on pitch 13 Pass success 50% Goal attempts 0 Tackles won 1 Once burst into the box and attempted a cross but did not make a great impression. 5/10 Owen Hargreaves Mins on pitch 4 Pass success 0% Goal attempts 0 Tackles won Ran like crazy, making a useful clearance and interception. 6/10 Alan Smith Mins on pitch 1 Pass success 0% Goal attempts 0 Tackles won 0"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
