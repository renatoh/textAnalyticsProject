This may explain why David Cameron yesterday took an initiative on one of the few issues on which opinion polling reveals a sharp gender divide. Women are stronger supporters of curbs on internet pornography than men are, and women are also more likely to want restrictions on sexual music videos and advertising, especially when directed at children. Both issues duly featured in the prime minister's Downing Street seminar on the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood, at which Mr Cameron also backed the new ParentPort website on which parents can raise issues and anxieties about inappropriate media treatment of, and pressure on, children. Mr Cameron is right to give these issues some priority. His approach contrasts with that of the previous government, which stood by during the expansion of online pornography access in this country without ever lifting a finger to do anything about it. Labour was scared of having a fight, for which the coalition has shown more readiness, with the internet service providers. The government is not just in tune with public opinion \u2013 nearly two-thirds of voters, including 79% of women, want to see internet pornography blocked. It is also doing the right thing. The internet's many benefits were never intended to include the bombarding of people's homes and children by pornography and spam to an unprecedented degree. Meanwhile, the destructive effects of pornography on relationships and values, harming not just children but also adults, far exceed any liberating effect which some claim to discern. Yet Mr Cameron's measures do not go far enough. The decision by the main internet service providers to require new customers to make a positive online choice in favour of access to unsuitable content is a step forward. But it is not a very large step. It leaves all existing customers unaffected, so the impact is likely to be extremely limited. It is also a slow step, which gives the ISPs until the end of 2012 to introduce the new filtering system. Mr Cameron has also done little to respond constructively to President Sarkozy's call this year for co-ordinated action on what is a truly global phenomenon. The anxiety to avoid improper or excessive interference with consumer freedom is laudable. So is the wish to work with rather than against the ISPs. These are the right reflexes. But so is a refusal to be indifferent to the fact and the scale of internet pornography. And so is the determination to protect childhood and to support good relationships. There should be no shame in trying to put the wonders of the internet to better uses than we do at present."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
