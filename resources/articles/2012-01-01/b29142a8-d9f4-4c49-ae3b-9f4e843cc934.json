In 2003 the house she lived in was demolished and she paid the final bill. I have built a new house on the site paying Southern Electric for energy. In February 2009, out of the blue, BG billed my mother \u00a33,889 from July 2003 to December 2008. After protracted calls, it accepted the error. Two years later my mother received a further bill, this time for \u00a34,309. It claimed my mother had been giving them meter readings for the past six years. BG admitted this bill should not have been issued and put the account on hold. It then re-issued the bill in my name. BT, Southampton Immediately after I had contacted BG, someone from the managing director's office phoned you, promising to sort out the problem by 3 January. You will know BG has corrected its messy record keeping only if the bills stop arriving. You received another one dated 9 January asking for \u00a33,236. You can ignore this, says BG, because it had been sent before your complaint was resolved. It assures me you will receive no more bills and has sent flowers to your mother.
