City had won only one of their previous five games, yet the result at Turf Moor, which featured two Gabriel Jesus goals and one each from Rodri and Riyad Mahrez, impressed. It cut the deficit to Liverpool to eight points \u2013 until Wednesday night\u2019s Merseyside derby, at least \u2013 and Rodri said the team celebrated hard. \u201cWe needed this victory,\u201d the midfielder said. \u201cIt was a good performance. Sometimes when you lose or draw your confidence can go down, and after this victory we were really having a party in the dressing room because we needed it to bring up the mentality and confidence of the team. \u201cEveryone is human, and when you don\u2019t get the results you need to get people\u2019s confidence up, this was an important victory. We will fight until the end because that is our mentality and identity.\u201d Jesus\u2019s goals took him to seven in 18 appearances. The Brazilian was deputising for the injured Sergio Ag\u00fcero, who has 13 in 16 games, and Jesus wants to emulate the Argentinian\u2019s strike rate. \u201cI know my qualities \u2013 I know I can score,\u201d Jesus said. \u201cI have to score when I play. Sergio scores every time. That is my ambition. I want to play and score every time. \u201cThe win is a confidence [booster] for us. This time the Premier League is so difficult. Liverpool are now eight points in front of us. We have to play all the matches like a final to win. We knew the game was going to be difficult, we know this when we come to play against Burnley, but we played good again.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
