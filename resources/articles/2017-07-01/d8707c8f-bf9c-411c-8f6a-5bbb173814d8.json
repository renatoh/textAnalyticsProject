A report published on Monday by Amnesty International found sexual violence in the world\u2019s newest country was rampant, and catalogued a litany of rape, sexual slavery, torture and castration perpetrated by South Sudan\u2019s government and the opposition. The documented cases represented premeditated sexual violence on a massive scale, said Amnesty\u2019s Muthoni Wanyeki. Thousands of people across the country have been raped since conflict broke out in December 2013, according to the report. The scale and brutality of sexual violence in the country echoes the situation in its neighbour, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where an epidemic of rape began in 1998. The South Sudanese government had failed to hold perpetrators to account, Amnesty said, and many survivors were reluctant to report what had happened to them, particularly if it had involved a government official. Sukeji was gang-raped by three government soldiers in Kajo Keji in August 2016 in front of her two children. \u201cI do not want to remember but sometimes it just comes in my mind and I cry,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes I wonder whether my children have this in their memory. When they grow up, what will they think of their mother?\u201d Nyagai lost her religious faith after being gang-raped by government soldiers in Juba in July last year. She said she stopped going to church after she was raped and no longer prayed. \u201cSatan went through me the day I was raped,\u201d she said. \u201cThese indefensible acts have left the victims with debilitating and life-changing consequences, including physical injuries and psychological distress,\u201d said Wanyeki. \u201cMany survivors have also been shunned by their husbands and in-laws, and stigmatised by the wider community. \u201cSome of the attacks appear designed to terrorise, degrade and shame the victims, and in some cases to stop men from rival political groups from procreating.\u201d The threat of mass starvation is hanging over South Sudan and there has been a recent escalation of fighting in the Equatoria region. Many victims of sexual violence have been targeted because of their ethnicity. James, a Dinka, was forced to watch as nine Nuer opposition fighters broke into his home and took turns gang-raping his wife, Acham, before killing her. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that Dinka and Nuer are fighting and that many Nuer were killed by Dinka in Juba?\u201d the attackers told him. Naimer said that while sexual violence had been a feature of many conflicts through history, it had not been recognised as a grave crime until recently. One of the things that shocked the world into recognising it was the brutality of the sexual violence in the DRC, which was similar to that in South Sudan. The two countries also shared a lack of accountability, she said. \u201cIn the fog of war, in the conflict, they take advantage of the lawlessness, the chaos,\u201d Naimer said. \u201cThey will perpetrate sexual violence in that context because they have the opportunity and they know that there\u2019s a limited likelihood that they may be held to account. \u201cThe outrageous situation in South Sudan [follows] a familiar pattern for sexual violence in conflict, where there is an utter breakdown in societal structures that support mechanisms for accountability of perpetrators. When those structures don\u2019t exist and there is deep crisis and conflict in the community, sexual violence is often used as a mechanism to humiliate and destroy vulnerable groups.\u201d Naimer added: \u201cIt\u2019s a cheap option and it is one we see in wide use in multiple conflicts. You can use your body to really harm whole communities. It doesn\u2019t cost a lot and the impact is awful.\u201d She said that the international community had lots of leverage and that it should use it to pressure governments to act. They should also \u201censure that while aid is implemented, justice processes are being supported as well\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
