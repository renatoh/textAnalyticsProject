Sven is more than happy with the job he's got.\" It is the second time this year that Still has had to spring into action and offer a denial. Eriksson had previously been linked with the coaching job at Barcelona. \"Every so often someone invents a story like this and, before you know, it gets arms and legs. But there is no truth in it whatsoever,\" said Still. The greater likelihood is that Del Bosque will be offered a one-year extension to his contract, given that Real look like regaining their title this Sunday. Mark Bosnich has lost his appeal against his sacking by Chelsea after his positive drugs test. The former Australia goalkeeper took the club to the Football League appeals committee to try to force them to reinstate his \u00a340,000-a-week contract, which was terminated in January. His lawyer Peter Goodman said Bosnich's legal team had yet to receive the written reasons for the decision. \"We'll be looking into an appeal when we receive the reasons,\" he said. A former minder of Cardiff City's owner Sam Hammam yesterday admitted setting off a hotel fire alarm which dis turbed opposition QPR players the night before a crucial play-off game against his former employer's team. Neil MacNamara, 39, pleaded guilty to causing criminal damage and giving a false alarm of fire at the Celtic Manor Resort hotel in Newport, South Wales. But he denied that the offence was football-related, Newport magistrates' court heard. MacNamara, who was sacked by the club before the fire alarm incident, was released on unconditional bail to appear at the court on July 16. Andy Melville will be a Ful ham player next season after all after last night agreeing a one-year contract extension. But Parma said that the on-loan midfielder Martin Djetou must take a pay cut if he wants to stay at Loftus Road for another year. The Italian club's sporting director Doriano Tosi said: \"The only problem remains the player's salary, which is very high at the moment.\" The French championship runners-up Monaco have won their appeal against relegation on financial grounds, the French Football Federation said yesterday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
