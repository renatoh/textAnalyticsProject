An executive from West Ham met O'Neill last week before the Northern Irishman declined the opportunity to take over from Grant after the club's interest in him was leaked to the media. West Ham subsequently claimed that speculation regarding the Israeli's future was unfounded, and Brady, the vice-chairman, was asked if this had made the club stronger. \"It's made our resolve and our commitment to get on and get things done and stay up,\" she said. \"But I think that was always there \u2013 that is always at the forefront of our minds, what things can we affect as a board to ensure the football club stays in the Premier League. And that is on and off the pitch, whether that be the Olympic Stadium [the club want it to be their new home], whether that be bringing players in \u2013 that's what keeps us awake at night. So those are the things we focus on.\" On Tuesday West Ham issued a statement that said the club was \"committed to retaining\" Grant. However, Brady twice passed up the opportunity to offer personal support to him. Asked to agree that Grant had shown leadership during the speculation regarding his job Brady refused to answer directly. She said: \"I'm sorry I've got so many calls coming through, we've got our Olympic Stadium bid going in tomorrow and that really is the thing I'm focused on for the next couple of days.\" Grant was angry when Brady revealed in her newspaper column a fortnight ago that she had vetoed the deal to sign Steve Sidwell from Aston Villa after the manager had stated publicly that he expected the midfielder to join. When asked if Brady thought West Ham would be able to bring in any more players with only 10 days remaining of the transfer window she said: \"This is not my area. I think this should be a conversation you have with the manager because player recruitment is nothing to do with me but I think you've seen the statement [on Tuesday] that says the board is trying to bring in players and that's what everyone's focusing on. \"Players is always a discussion you should be having with the manager not with me. David Sullivan [the co-owner] is the money person, so if you want to have a word with David Sullivan he's the one that will decide how much and who and where.\" West Ham have revived their interest in Demba Ba, the Hoffenheim striker who failed a medical Stoke City, and Tal Ben-Haim may be signed on a long-term deal from Portsmouth having spent the first half of the season on loan at Upton Park."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
