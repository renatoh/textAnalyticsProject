The manager is hopeful that Ag\u00fcero, whose two goals in the 4-1 win were the forward\u2019s first since 3 December, should be fit for City\u2019s next match, Newcastle United\u2019s visit on Saturday week. \u201cKun felt something in his back, my feeling is that its not something too serious, and we have now 10 days to train well and recover well,\u201d said Pellegrini. Asked if Ag\u00fcero will be fit when Barcelona visit the Etihad Stadium in the Champions League on 24 February, the Chilean said: \u201cI hope he will be fit on the 21st against Newcastle. When Sergio has more minutes, he will return to his normal performance level. He scored one goal, he scored a penalty and I think it\u2019s important for him, for [Samir] Nasri, for [Edin] Dzeko, [Vincent] Kompany, all the players who have come back from long injuries, to have minutes, and if they have minutes they will improve.\u201d This was City\u2019s first league win since New Year\u2019s Day. \u201cWe needed this victory, because the last four games we didn\u2019t win,\u201d said Pellegrini. \u201cStoke are a very tough team, I think in the last three games I have played against them in charge of Manchester City we scored just once, so to score four goals here is very important and we\u2019ll see if we can continue this way in the future.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
