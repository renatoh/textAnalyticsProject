I think it should be rare and safe,\u201d he added. \u201cI think we should be focusing on how to limit the number of abortions.\u201d The clip is the latest evidence of Biden\u2019s inconsistent record on the issue. Last week, the former vice-president, a 2020 frontrunner, flip-flopped on his position on the Hyde amendment, a measure that prohibits the use of federal funding for abortions. One day after saying he supported the Hyde amendment, following backlash from Democrats, he dropped a position he had held for decades. \u201cIf I believe healthcare is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone\u2019s zip code,\u201d he told an audience at the Democratic National Committee\u2019s African American Leadership Council Summit in Atlanta on 6 June. In 1977 Biden voted against a compromise that would have allowed federal funds to be used for abortions in cases of rape or incest or concerns for the life of the mother. The compromise passed in that case, but in 1981 Biden voted again to remove them. Also in 1981, Biden voted to let states overturn Roe v Wade, citing his background as a Roman Catholic at the time and calling the decision \u201cthe single most difficult vote I\u2019ve cast as a US senator\u201d. In 2015, he described his views to the Catholic magazine America: \u201cI\u2019m prepared to accept that at the moment of conception there\u2019s human life and being, but I\u2019m not prepared to say that to other God-fearing, non-God-fearing people that have a different view.\u201d Earlier in June, when pressed on his inconsistent voting record and statements on abortion rights, Biden became aggressive and wagged his finger in the faces of reproductive rights activists. The activists said they fled the event, fearing it would \u201cescalate\u201d. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be in a shouting match,\u201d one activist said. Biden has a rating of 34% from Naral Pro-Choice America, a group that scores candidates based on their track record of supporting abortion rights. His opponents senators Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand have 100% ratings from the group."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
