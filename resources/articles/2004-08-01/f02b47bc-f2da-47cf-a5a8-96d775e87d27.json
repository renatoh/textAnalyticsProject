But within an hour the solicitors admitted that the papers had been recovered and they had just taken an \"extra precautionary measure\" by issuing a warning to newspapers. \"The papers have been safely retrieved, there is no story,\" said her solicitor, Steven Barker, of criminal law firm Barker Gillette. Ms Alam yesterday resigned from the Football Association and has sold her story to two Sunday newspapers - the News of the World and the Mail on Sunday - in a deal worth around \u00a3400,000. She has agreed to tell her story on TV with a \u00a3100,000 deal with ITV's Tonight with Trevor McDonald. The warning initially fuelled immediate speculation that the law firm had been burgled or been the victim of a late night raid along the lines of those once conducted by Benjamin Pell - known as Benji the Binman - who plied a trade by retrieving highly confidential information from bin bags from high-profile law and accountancy firms and selling it on to newspapers. The legal warning issued this afternoon said that the papers had been stolen from the firm and the theft reported to the police. It said Ms Alam's solicitors would seek injunctive relief to prevent the publication of the whole or part of any of these documents should any newspaper seek to use the content of the documents. Mr Barker is a high-powered partner in a firm specialising in serious and business fraud, excise duty and VAT evasion. He represented Leeds United footballer Lee Bowyer in an assault case and also acted for Chelsea footballer John Terry who was cleared of possessing an offensive weapon and affray two years ago. He has also represented a British army major accused of spying for the Bosnian serbs and more recently worked with Chelsea footballer John Terry in Middlesex Crown Court. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
