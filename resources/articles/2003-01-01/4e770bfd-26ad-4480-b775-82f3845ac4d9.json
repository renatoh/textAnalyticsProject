As Britain faced a teacher recruitment shortage in the tail end of 2001 and schools were threatening to cut classes, the DfES sent out an SOS to the former colonies. Never mind the needs of your own schools, come to Mother England in her hour of need. And a fair number of teachers answered the call. For some, the journey proved a success; for others, it has turned out to be a costly mistake. Demand for overseas teachers fell, mainly due to cultural and curricular differences, and the job market went flat. At the end of last year, the DfES declared that recruiting overseas teachers had been an \"experiment\" all along, and that the experiment was now over. Teaching in England was always likely to be especially appealing to Africans, as they could earn up to four times more in this country. Recruiting African teachers was similarly always likely to appeal to teaching agencies because of the huge discrepancy between what they could charge the schools and what they need pay the teachers. It was a recipe for a disaster, and that's how it turned out. Seated around the offices of the Camden branch of the National Union of Teachers are 15 teachers from South Africa, Zimbabwe and Uganda. They are all broke and all but out of work, though paradoxically there is plenty of work available; it's just that they're not allowed to take it. They blame their recruitment agency, Teaching Personnel, the DfES and the Home Office for their predicament. The 15 teachers have agreed to speak on the condition they are not identified. I assume it's because of legal complications with their work permits. \"Not so,\" says Emmanuel. \"It's because we are scared of people reading this back home. We feel so ashamed. We all left or turned down good jobs at home to come to Britain. Now we are a laughing stock.\" \"I came here because I wanted to gain experience in Britain and send money back home,\" Theresa adds. \"Instead, my family are having to send me money to help me get by.\" The developing world supporting the world's fourth-largest economy. Explain that, Clare Short. The story starts with an advert for supply teachers. Some read it in their local papers, others on the internet. All those who replied were given a phone interview and had their qualifications checked out by the National Academic Recognition Information Centre (NARIC). Those accepted were sent a letter from Teaching Personnel saying: \"Congratulations, you are one of the 100 best teachers in Africa.\" If they wanted accommodation they were asked to pay a deposit of \u00a3250. They also had to pay their air fares. They were offered a guaranteed \u00a365 a day regardless of whether they were working, and promised a \u00a31,000 bonus after six months and a further \u00a31,000 after a year. There was no need for the teachers to apply for a work permit because the government had changed the law to allow the agency to obtain the permits. There were a few teething problems. Those who used Teaching Personnel's accommodation agency say their lodgings were little more than bed and breakfast: teachers were told they had to be out of the premises during the daytime, even at the weekend. But by and large, all went well: there was enough work, and the teachers and their schools were happy with the situation. Things started to go pear-shaped around June last year. The work began to dry up and some teachers were unhappy they were asked to take jobs out of London, even though there was a provision for this in their contracts. \"I had signed a six-month rental agreement on a flat,\" says Elizabeth. \"Teaching Personnel told me I would be made redundant if I didn't relocate to Manchester. So I had to move and pay for two lots of accommodation.\" Most of the 15 teachers say they were also pressured into changing contracts. \"We were told it was too expensive to pay us \u00a365 a day and that we would have to switch to a contract that paid \u00a3105 a day if we worked and nothing if we didn't,\" says Julius. \"They were keen not to pay us during the summer holidays. Once we switched contracts we were told we no longer qualified for the bonuses, even though we had been with the agency for more than six months. We tried to talk to the agency, but they refused to speak to us in person and said all conversations had to be via the telephone.\" The majority of the teachers say they got very little work for the rest of the year, and claim that what work was available usually went to those few teachers who had refused to switch contracts and were still being paid \u00a317,000 (\u00a365 per day regardless). Some teachers were told by their schools that they had permanent places available and would love to be able to employ them, but the fact that their work permits were held by Teaching Personnel made them ineligible. Now that the Home Office has changed the rules on work permits, it is too late. Bizarrely, at the same time Teaching Personnel was telling the African teachers about the shortage of work, it was also running an advertising campaign in the educational press to recruit more supply teachers. A media spokesman for Teaching Personnel forwards the allegations against the company to its chief executive, Fiona Eldridge. This is her response. \"We recognise the major commitment that overseas teachers have made in coming to this country and deeply regret the distress that has been caused to those affected by the redundancy process last year. To help alleviate this we have put in place a package of support including assistance with relocation to other areas of the UK, assistance with securing permanent posts, payment of the costs of repatriation and have established a support fund for those experiencing financial difficulty. To date, 70% of those teachers seeking posts have gained permanent employment. We are continuing to work closely with unions, the DfES, schools and LEAs to locate permanent posts for the remaining teachers. \"Teaching Personnel has historically recruited teachers from overseas but the recent success of government initiatives in recruiting new teachers and encouraging people to return to teaching has meant there is now approximately an extra 10,000 teachers in schools - a 20-year high in teacher numbers. This success has impacted on supply agencies and last year the supply teacher market experienced an unprecedented downturn in demand. \"The downturn in demand led to reductions in staff numbers both at our head office and in our teaching force. Redundant teachers represent less than 20% of those affected.\" Both the NUT and local MPs have taken up the African teachers' case. Teaching Personnel has agreed an ex gratia hardship payment, but it falls short of what the teachers want. Or say they need. The DfES takes a different view of the matter. David Miliband, minister of state for school standards, says that Teaching Personnel has been investigated by the appropriate authorities and concludes that \"the agency has acted reasonably in response to a genuine downturn in business\". There are schools keen to employ these teachers. They are keen to work. There are classrooms without teachers. Does this make sense to anyone?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
