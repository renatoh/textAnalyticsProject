As prime ministerial tip-offs go, this was about as blatant as they come. Mr Blair only just stopped short of handing out photocopies of tomorrow's energy review with his favourite pro-nuclear passages underlined in red magic marker. His comments followed several ministerial interviews sympathetic to nuclear and the prime minister's speech to the CBI warning that nuclear power is \"back on the agenda with a vengeance\" as a result of understandable fears over climate change. The result is that the government's energy review - effectively the second in three years - is being seen in largely nuclear terms. This is a pity and one test of tomorrow's report will be the extent to which it puts Britain's future energy needs into a wider context. The decision on nuclear matters. But so does the future of other forms of generation and energy efficiency. Today's report from the Commons trade and industry committee underlines concern about the government's enthusiasm for painting the question in stark colours, when a more subtle palette is appropriate. A lot remains to be settled, not least the extent to which developments in technology - such as clean coal, carbon capture, wave and tidal power - could avoid the need for new nuclear plants. The committee report does not oppose them, but stresses that the energy review must be \"technology neutral\" and not hide the cost, in terms of construction, waste and decomissioning, that nuclear carries with it. In this, the report echoes last week's Conservative policy announcement. Wrestling with both its environmental conscience and its pro-nuclear heritage, the party stopped short of opposing the construction of new nuclear stations but made it clear that they are far from its first choice. In substance, the policy may not differ much from the government's, but in tone the opposition trade spokesman Alan Duncan's caution runs counter to the prime minister's gung-ho enthusiasm for a new atomic age. Meanwhile, the IPPR thinktank has joined the pre-review chorus with a report stressing the need for energy savings. That can only work up to a point: power still needs to be generated. The question is how it should be done. Tomorrow's review needs to take the debate away from one particular source, balancing efficiency against generation, renewables against nuclear and fossil fuels, and not shying from setting out the costs on all sides."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
