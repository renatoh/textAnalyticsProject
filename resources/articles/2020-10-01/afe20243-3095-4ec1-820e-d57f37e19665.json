California has borne the brunt of the fires, with one electricity provider cutting supply to 30,000 homes in an effort to prevent power lines sparking further blazes. Dry conditions and 70mph gusts have exacerbated the fires, prolonging an already devastating fire season that has killed 31 people. Meanwhile, in South Sudan, swathes of the country have been left underwater after months of heavy rainfall. Flooding has been occurring on a periodic basis for months in some areas, with a total of 800,000 people estimated to be affected. Much of the flooding is associated with the White Nile bursting its banks, with 400,000 people displaced. Neighbouring Ethiopia has also been affected, with more than 300,000 people displaced. Finally, thunderstorms have caused disruption in the Australian state of Queensland in recent days. Hailstones the size of golf balls and more than 80,000 lightning strikes pounded the area on Sunday, causing 30,000 homes to lose power. One man was reportedly injured by a falling tree."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
