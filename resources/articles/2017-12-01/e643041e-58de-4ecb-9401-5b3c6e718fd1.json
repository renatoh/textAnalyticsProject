Guardiola\u2019s infringement came after Raheem Sterling\u2019s injury-time goal gave City a 2-1 victory at the Etihad on Wednesday. It was their 19th win in succession and whereas City\u2019s manager was on the field for an extended period, Mourinho\u2019s red card came after he put one foot on the pitch, though this was during play. The Portuguese received no further action from the Football Association, a tacit admission that the referee, Craig Pawson, made the wrong decision, which came in the closing seconds of United\u2019s 1-0 win. Mourinho was asked whether he was surprised Guardiola did not draw a similar punishment from Paul Tierney, who refereed City\u2019s match against Southampton. \u201cSurprised? No, not surprised,\u201d he said, though he would not be drawn on whether that was because he feels there is a different rule for him. \u201cYou are asking me one question. If I am surprised, I say I am not surprised. The second question is nothing. It\u2019s another one.\u201d Pressed on why he was surprised, Mourinho laughed. \u201cYou [his questioners] have team spirit and tactics,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t answer to the second question. You know, if you are my friends, don\u2019t ask me the question, because you know I get into trouble, so no.\u201d At the final whistle on Wednesday Guardiola also confronted Southampton\u2019s Nathan Redmond in a truculent manner. The player issued a statement to say he had no issue with this, though the Football Association has asked Guardiola for his observations. Again, Mourinho chose to stonewall. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me that,\u201d he said. On Saturday United are at Arsenal for the late kick-off in which Mesut \u00d6zil should feature and for whom Mourinho has not ruled out making a move in the summer, when the German\u2019s contract expires at the Emirates. The Portuguese coached \u00d6zil at Real Madrid and has described him as the best No10 in the world. The position is proving a problem one for the United manager, who recently dropped Henrikh Mkhitaryan. \u201cNo comments,\u201d he said. Nemanja Matic\u2019s availability is in the balance for the match because of a muscle problem. \u201cI hope he can play but I cannot guarantee it,\u201d Mourinho added. \u201cHe is selected to go, let\u2019s see the feeling before the match, let\u2019s see the warm-up. \u201cI hope he can, I want him to, he wants to, but I cannot guarantee and [Marouane] Fellaini is not travelling with the team.\u201d Eric Bailly and Phil Jones are not fit to travel either because of injuries."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
