Scolari, whose spokesman suggested the club had not sufficiently backed his client in the transfer market, was informed of the owner's decision at 3pm on Monday in a meeting, described as \"amicable\", at the club's training ground. In attendance with him were Abramovich, the director Eugene Tenenbaum and the chairman, Bruce Buck \u2013 the chief executive, Peter Kenyon, is abroad but was involved in the dialogue. The final straw was Saturday's 0\u20130 draw with Hull City at Stamford Bridge, a result which left Chelsea with only six wins in 13 home games. The search for a fifth manager in as many years has begun with the club wanting a quick appointment, most likely someone currently unemployed and considered a \"firefighter\", to be taken on initially on a short-term basis. If the appointment proves successful the candidate would have a chance to earn a longer deal. Frank Rijkaard, the former Barcelona coach, is in contention, together with the ex-Internazionale coach Roberto Mancini as Chelsea embark on a familiar recruitment process. A shortlist is being drawn up which is not expected to include Avram Grant, who guided the club to the Champions League final last season. Abramovich would ideally like to consider the merits of Guus Hiddink, who took Russia to the European Championship at England's expense last summer and then to the semi-finals, but the Dutchman's agent said his client remains committed to the national team's cause. \"Guus wants to qualify for the World Cup for a fourth time in a row,\" said Cees van Nieuwenhuizen. \"There's no chance of him going to Chelsea as he very much likes what he is doing now.\" While there is a sense of surprise at the timing of the dismissal given that the team are still competing in the Champions League and FA Cup, concern had been growing behind the scenes as the side slipped seven points behind Manchester United in the title race. Unrest had swept through the stands at Stamford Bridge as the team toiled against Hull on Saturday, with Scolari enduring chants of \"You don't know what you're doing\". One banner was unfurled championing the former Chelsea players Gianfranco Zola and Roberto di Matteo \u2013 neither is in contention to return to the club at this stage of their fledgling managerial careers \u2013 though more damaging for the Brazilian was the reaction of some senior players in his squad to the malaise which had seen the side win only four of their last 12 league matches, and muster a solitary point from five encounters with the established elite quartet at the top of the division. Frank Lampard and John Terry had spoken with the 60-year-old to request more intensity in training earlier this season and, although they are understood to have remained broadly supportive of the manager and expressed shock at the news last night, other players within the set-up had become disillusioned, unconvinced as they were that Scolari had adapted to the transition from international coach with Portugal to club management in the Premier League. Those misgivings were eventually mirrored in the boardroom. Scolari was less than seven months into a two-year contract and had added only Deco (\u00a38m), Mineiro (free) and Ricardo Quaresma, on loan, to his squad, an outlay that contrasts sharply with Jose Mourinho. Grant had at least spent \u00a315m on Nicolas Anelka a year ago. The Brazilian will be paid the remaining 18 months of his contract, totalling about \u00a37.5m, and reacted with dignity last night, issuing a statement in which he expressed gratitude at having been offered the chance to manage in England, suggesting he had had a \"marvellous time\" at the club, and adding: \"I wish Chelsea luck in the three competitions in which they are involved.\" Yet his spokesman, Acaz Fellegger, hinted the Brazilian had been the victim of broken promises after seeing the global financial crisis frustrate his attempts to transform the club's playing squad. \"Everyone knows that [when Scolari took over] he needed to make the team younger,\" said Fellegger. \"The same team had been together for four years. This was the deal with the board of directors. This process was started: eight players left the team at the start of the season and Deco came in. Robinho was also supposed to come in but that didn't happen and others were supposed to follow during the January transfer window. Then the [financial] crisis came along and interrupted this process. Some players got injured and the results were not satisfactory. The decision [to sack Scolari] came from the guy at the top.\" Chelsea's financial results are due to be announced this week and they are thought to illustrate that Abramovich remains wholly committed to the club. A spokesman for the Russian oligarch declined to comment on Monday night. The assistant manager, Ray Wilkins, will take charge of the team for the immediate future \u2013 the side travel to Watford in the FA Cup on Saturday \u2013 with Scolari intent on remaining in London until the summer with the view to securing another job in European football having endured the sack for only the second time in 27 years as a manager."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
