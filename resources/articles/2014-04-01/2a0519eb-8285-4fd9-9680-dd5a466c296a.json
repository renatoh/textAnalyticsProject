That much is clear after they lost 32-10 to the table-topping Sharks at the weekend. The margin of defeat suggests a spanking. It wasn\u2019t. In fact, as ridiculous as it may sound, Tahs coach Michael Cheika would have been pleased. The clich\u00e9 of a loss having more value than a win applies in this case. Cheika\u2019s team is a work in progress \u2013 he\u2019s always said that, notwithstanding stating aspirations for a top two finish. And the Tahs have never hit as hard in the tackle as they did against the Sharks on the weekend. They rattled and shook the Durban side to distraction. However, that steely defence was equally and fatally matched with butter fingers as countless attacking raids came to nought due to a general lack of finesse in breakdown ball security and presentation for the half-back. The handling errors meant the Tahs couldn\u2019t maintain pressure with sustained attacking sequences. The Sharks, meanwhile, weathered the defensive blitz, picked off their penalty goals and scored two tries. Effective rugby but by no means a humbling of the Tahs as some reports have suggested. Despite post-match baiting by Sharks\u2019 coach Jake White \u2013 who is increasingly revealing himself to be a rather smug character \u2013 Cheika ought not be too upset at what transpired. His players already have an uncoachable positive attitude in defence, and the breakdown issues with ball presentation and effective exit strategies out of their own half can be fixed easily enough in training. Cheika might also take a closer look at half-back Nick Phipps who appeared flustered at times. Brendon McKibbin could be worth a shot against the Stormers this weekend. Too much has been made of Israel Folau\u2019s absence due to a throat injury. Of course he\u2019s a brilliant player, but he\u2019s a follower who has scored most of his eight tries this season running off line-breaks by others. There\u2019s a breakdown contest that needs to be won before Folau can work his magic. Force could be No1 Aussie team next week The Western Force and more recently the Rebels have proved this year\u2019s Super competition is a week-to-week paupers to prince narrative. And, in the case of the seven-time champs the Crusaders, the reverse of that following their home loss to the \u2018Canes, which this column tipped as the upset of the round. The Brumbies would be ruing their unexpected loss against the Rebels in Melbourne. The ACT team head the Tahs by just a point at the top of Australian conference and face a resurgent Blues with Jerome Kaino and Ma\u2019a Nonu back in the side in Canberra on Friday. With the Tahs taking on the increasingly disappointing Stormers in the early hours of Sunday morning, a new conference leader come next Monday wouldn\u2019t a surprise. And that outcome includes the possibility of the Tahs and Brumbies both losing and either the Reds or Force picking up a four-try bonus point when they play each other at Suncorp on Saturday. Imagine that, the Western Force top of the Australian conference heading into round nine. Will the real Quade Cooper please stand up? Even stranger than a Force table-topping scenario is that nobody is talking about the Reds. They limped home against the Stormers at Suncorp and still look very much out of sorts; certainly nothing like the free-spirited side that took the title in 2011. So what\u2019s the problem? Wallabies coach Ewen McKenzie made the simple yet incisive observation that, as the Reds are conceding the bulk of their penalties on defence, maybe they should attack more. He nailed it. The Reds, with half-back Will Genia the chief culprit, are persisting with ineffective little kicks in the opposition\u2019s 22. It\u2019s a shame and makes absolutely no sense given the quality of their backline. The Queenslanders look like a team playing muscular chess by rote. Quade Cooper has been praised by the establishment for a new-found maturity and control in his play-making but he\u2019s taking self-control too far. He\u2019s made the mistake of trying to model his game on Dan Carter\u2019s, when there\u2019s only ever been one Quade Cooper. That Cooper took the Reds to the title three years ago. He needs to find himself again. The real Cooper has far more upside than an attempted Carter clone. Talking points \u2022 Victor Matfield, 36, and out of retirement to help his beloved Bulls was easily the best lock in round seven. Has there been a better line-out forward in world rugby? Not to my mind. He schooled Chiefs counterpart and All Black Test lock Brodie Retallick, 22, in the first drawn match of the season. It was a classic case of wise master and young apprentice. Matfield, the old bull indeed. \u2022 The Crusaders couldn\u2019t wait to get out of Christchurch after dropping a home game against the Hurricanes. The once great franchise at 2-3 are in dire straits at the bottom of the New Zealand conference. The Crusaders need a maximum of 10 points on the road against the Lions and Cheetahs, before dealing with long-haul travel and a shortened training week to face the Chiefs in Hamilton on 19 April. One slip up in South Africa could signal the end for coach Todd Blackadder. \u2022 Whispers of Benji Marshall taking flight from the Blues to the UK Super League are intensifying. John Kirwan has thrown his lot in with rookie five-eighth Simon Hickey, and the youngster has delivered in spades. Hickey also worked beautifully with Piri Weepu\u2019s replacement, Bryn Hall, against the Highlanders last Saturday. In fact, Weepu, who has been indefinitely sidelined after suffering a minor stroke, could struggle to get his spot back. Hall was that good. With Charles Piutau preferred at full-back and Hickey doing the business at fly-half, it\u2019s hard to see Marshall getting significant game time for the rest of the season. \u2022 The Kiwis are worried about Australia\u2019s new development comp, the National Rugby Championship (NRC). Writing in the New Zealand Herald, Gregor Paul has warned the Kiwi talent pool could be raided by the nine new Aussie teams. \u201cThe Australian Rugby Union have stated that they see the new competition as an important part of player development; an opportunity to start breeding future Wallabies. That could be read as a preclusion to recruitment of players from New Zealand,\u201d Paul wrote. \u201cWhy spend heavily on a development tournament and fill it with players from New Zealand? Well, for the simple reason that it only takes three years to turn proud Kiwis into fair dinkum Aussies.\u201d Auckland ITM coach Wayne Pivac broke down the numbers side of Paul\u2019s argument. \"If they are going to have nine teams, with probable squads of 28, that's 254 players they are going to need to find. I would imagine it will become yet another market for players here,\u201d Pivac said. There\u2019s no question Kiwi players will feature in the NRC. So what? Trans-Tasman migration for economic and family reasons is nothing new. Who can begrudge a player for taking a four-hour flight for potentially more game time and a better life? Jason Woodward at the Rebels, man of the moment with a 27-point haul against the Brumbies last Friday, will tell you leaving NZ was the best career move he ever made. Ditto Mike Harris at the Reds. Quade Cooper too. And Will Genia had an even shorter flight from Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea. The NRC will also attract players from the Pacific Islands. The $18,000 or thereabouts salary for a short playing stint is a year\u2019s professional salary on the islands. One final thought on the NRC: why didn\u2019t the ARU approach the NZRU to discuss a joint trans-Tasman competition? Surely that would hold more appeal to broadcasters and fans than a standalone Australian tournament. It would also have presented an ideal opportunity to establish, say, an Auckland or Sydney-based Pacific Islands development side with AUSAID funding. With New Zealand and Australia this week lifting travel sanctions against Fiji, access to Fiji Military Force players from the Army and Navy clubs could throw up some interesting specimens.
