Deeply committed to the cause of a healthy Estonia, especially for children, she worked to integrate her country's health policy into the new Europe. Praxis's work took in prevention - focusing on Estonia's HIV epidemic - and cure, looking at hospital reform, where Estonia has been more successful than many other countries. And Ruta played a key role in ensuring that Estonia was represented in projects such the European Union-funded Europe for Patients scheme. Partly trained in England, Ruta belonged to that generation of bright young people, exposed to western ideas, who contributed to their country's transition from republic of the Soviet Union to independence. She graduated in medicine from Tartu University in 1991, when Estonia was among the most exciting of the countries then emerging from the Soviet bloc. Having worked briefly in gynaecology in Tallinn she then engaged with the health policy reforms then gathering pace. In 1993 she became adviser for maternal and child health at the social affairs ministry. She implemented a countrywide school health programme, and introduced a network of community level public health specialists. Soon she was heading the ministry's disease prevention bureau, focusing particularly on children and became involved in the European network of health-promoting schools, in which 66 Estonian ones are now enrolled. It was in 1996 that she became deputy head of the department of public health. She had never received formal policy training, except for short courses in Sweden and Britain. But in 1999, she was awarded a Muskie fellowship, and graduated from Boston University, in 2001 with a masters in public health. Then, back in Estonia, she co-founded Praxis. Ruta, who exuded enthusiasm and energy, always managed to balance work and family, supported by her husband, Oliver, who had been her childhood sweetheart. Ruta is survived by her husband, whose sister Kristel also died in the crash, by her three young children and by her mother and brother. \u00b7 Ruta Kruuda, health policy expert, born March 10 1967; died August 10 2005"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
