I want to be treasurer.\u201d \u201cI really want to be treasurer of Australia, that\u2019s my focus. I mean that seriously. I was treasurer [in the last period of government] all too briefly, I\u2019ve got unfinished business. That\u2019s my job, that\u2019s the job I\u2019m focused on. I hope I\u2019m treasurer for a long time.\u201d In an interview with Guardian Australia\u2019s politics podcast at the tail end of budget week, Bowen plays it with a dead bat when pressed whether it\u2019s plausible he could be the only person in federal politics without active leadership aspirations \u2013 he being the most senior figure from the New South Wales right of the ALP. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon He believes the future will take care of itself \u2013 he won\u2019t rule it in or out. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say I want the job or I don\u2019t want the job,\u201d he says. \u201cI am saying Bill Shorten has the job, I hope he has it for a very long time. I hope he\u2019s a long-serving and successful prime minister and I\u2019m his treasurer for a long time.\u201d This week, the major parties thrust themselves on to an election footing after using the budget week to announce competing offerings on personal income tax cuts. The last vestige of the dual citizenship imbroglio that has cut a swathe through Australian politics for the best part of 12 months has also played out this week, creating a mini-election over the next couple of months courtesy of polls in Longman, Braddon, Fremantle and Mayo, as well as in Perth because of the resignation of Tim Hammond for family reasons. The super Saturday is a harbinger for the real deal, which could happen any time after August, although the prime minister has spent the week insisting the Coalition will run a full term, with no election until next year. It\u2019s been a week where the Turnbull government has significantly stepped up the negative rhetoric on Shorten, invoking a fresh character assault on the Labor leader, who in turn has leaned in for the fight, declaring the opposition will campaign \u201chouse by house, street by street, suburb by suburb\u201d. Shorten says Labor will use the coming mini-election season as a \u201creferendum on your $80bn corporate tax giveaway to multinationals, big business and the big banks\u201d. Bowen says it is possible the political contest has already tightened and he predicts the national conversation will get more combative. \u201cOne iron law of Australian politics: neither side will ever switch off the lights and say it is all too hard and we are just going to hand over to the other side. That doesn\u2019t happen. \u201cThese guys [the Coalition] fight hard. I would say sometimes they fight dirty, but they fight hard, there\u2019s a contest. One thing Australians hate is complacency and arrogance, so we are certainly not saying we have the election in the bag. Yes, we\u2019ve been ahead [in the polls] for a long time, but that can change. We don\u2019t take anything for granted.\u201d While Labor intends to focus politically on the government\u2019s intention to give a tax cut to Australia\u2019s biggest companies \u2013 a proposal the opposition rejects \u2013 Bowen won\u2019t yet say what his party will do with the company tax cuts that have already been legislated. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to drag it out,\u201d the shadow treasurer says, \u201cbut we\u2019ll, to coin a phrase, decide our own announcements and the circumstances in which we announce them.\u201d Labor\u2019s national conference looms in July, creating complications for the leadership as hot-button policies will be contested at the event as well as in the days leading up to it. Bowen acknowledges there will be \u201clively\u201d debate about economic policy, but says the conversation going on within Labor isn\u2019t a left-right divide. \u201cWith due respect, these debates get overblown,\u201d he says. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a factional thing.\u201d He says he and Shorten are rightwingers, but they have presided over Labor\u2019s most progressive policy offering in 40 years. \u201cI make no apologies for that. I am proud of it. I happen to be a member of the right. Bill Shorten is a member of the right. This is the policy agenda we have developed because it is right for the times.\u201d He acknowledges that some within Labor\u2019s left are attracted to measures such as the Buffet rule \u2013 where wealthy people are forced to pay a minimum rate of tax \u2013 but he says he will continue to resist such proposals. Bowen says he has developed several alternatives, such as closing down tax minimisation through family trusts, and reforming negative gearing and capital gains tax. \u201cI\u2019m getting on with the job of doing those things, achieving the same objectives, but in a carefully designed way, and that\u2019s what I will say at the national conference.\u201d He says Labor will have to demonstrate spending restraint to present itself as a credible alternative to voters at the next election, but insists it was necessary for the party during this period of opposition to look forensically at tax concessions such as negative gearing and dividend imputation \u2013 measures that have given Labor considerable fiscal room to outspend the government on social services, and also outbid the Coalition on tax cuts for low and middle-income earners. Bowen also says Labor\u2019s relationship with the business community is in good shape, despite obvious public tensions between the federal opposition and groups such as the Business Council of Australia. He suggests some of the combativeness is a broader cultural phenomenon \u2013 there is now more polarisation in public debate. \u201cPolitical debates across the developed world are becoming more polarised. [Australia is] probably doing better than most. We haven\u2019t had Brexit, we haven\u2019t had Trump. We\u2019ve had 27 years of uninterrupted economic growth. Globally, there is more tribalism.\u201d Bowen says polarisation is being driven, at least in part, by social media platforms reinforcing the views of users rather than presenting a diversity of material, and through mainstream media outlets. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that 40 years ago, if I said what newspaper do you read, I could work out how you vote,\u201d the shadow treasurer says. \u201cBut I think more and more you can. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s particularly healthy. I think it\u2019s better to see a mix of views presented in your news feed to test your views.\u201d Addressing the specific tensions with business, and the decision of big corporate groups to advertise with a view to courting public support and campaigning to defend their interests, Bowen says \u201cthe business community should stand up for itself\u201d. But business also needs to \u201cget its house in order\u201d. \u201cI make no apologies for, with Bill Shorten, calling for a royal commission into the banks. I don\u2019t think our position has been found wanting,\u201d Bowen says. \u201cOn the relationship between Labor and the business community, I find history instructive. People will say now \u2018I wish it was like the Hawke Keating years where Labor and business got along\u2019. Well you go back and read the clips. \u201cKeating was accused of being anti-business because he brought in the fringe benefits tax and capital gains tax, he was broadening the base and lowering the rates. That\u2019s what we are doing in some respects. \u201cI see what I\u2019m doing in many respects as a continuation of the Keating legacy. Let\u2019s not pretend the business community was clapping him or he was saying nice things about people in the business community criticising him.\u201d Bowen says businesses are telling him privately that they think cutting the company tax rate is not a first order priority, but they won\u2019t say that publicly because they \u201cdon\u2019t want to rock the boat with the Business Council of Australia\u201d. He says he maintains a network of relationships in business and has \u201cgreat discussions\u201d about a range of policy issues. \u201cSo, of course, yes, there\u2019s a robust debate politically, I make no apologies for that, and they are entitled to put their views and we are entitled to put ours, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as binary [as you suggest]\u201d. He also has a message for the trade union movement. Shorten is close to several key figures in the union leadership, and Labor has already begun rolling out specific policies the movement is seeking. But Bowen suggests this conversation won\u2019t all go the ACTU\u2019s way. The ACTU\u2019s wish list will not get an \u201cautomatic tick\u201d. He says the party and the movement are \u201cdifferent people with different jobs to do\u201d. The shadow treasurer says the ACTU is right to run a public campaign to strengthen workplace regulations in an environment where workers face persistently low wages growth. But he says Labor will make its own decisions about where it ultimately draws the policy lines."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
