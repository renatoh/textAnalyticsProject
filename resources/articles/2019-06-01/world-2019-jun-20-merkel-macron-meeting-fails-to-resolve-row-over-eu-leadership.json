An unproductive meeting on Thursday between the German chancellor and the French president appeared to dash any hope of a swift resolution to their dispute over the future leadership of the EU\u2019s institutions, including a replacement for Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the European commission. The European council president, Donald Tusk, who had previously expressed some optimism that leaders would agree at this week\u2019s EU summit on their nominations for a cast of senior positions, offered a downcast reading of the situation. \u201cYesterday I was cautiously optimistic. Today I\u2019m more cautious than optimistic,\u201d Tusk tweeted. Ireland\u2019s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, quipped as he arrived at the summit: \u201cIt\u2019s quicker to elect the pope very often than it is to fill these particular positions.\u201d Merkel admitted to reporters: \u201cThere is still a range of problems.\u201d The EU\u2019s top five jobs \u2013 presidents of the commission, council, European parliament and European Central Bank and high representative for foreign affairs \u2013 are all changing hands. Merkel and Macron have been in dispute since the European elections over the claims to Juncker\u2019s job of Manfred Weber, a German MEP who is the centre-right European People\u2019s party\u2019s (EPP) lead candidate for the post. Merkel has been a steadfast supporter of her compatriot, whose group remained the biggest in the European parliament after May\u2019s elections, and on Thursday she appeared to be stubbornly backing him against Paris\u2019s open hostility. Macron used an interview at the summit to attack the so-called spitzenkandidaten system under which the lead candidate of the most successful political group in European elections is able to stake a claim to the commission presidency. Macron said the system was a \u201cEuropean fiction\u201d that lacked credibility as it was not understood by the electorate. Macron has positioned himself firmly against Weber\u2019s candidacy, claiming he lacks the government experience necessary to deal with the role. That the EPP, which counts Merkel as a member, emerged weakened from the elections in May has also damaged Weber\u2019s claim to the role. The liberal group now known as Renew Europe was bolstered by the success of Macron\u2019s En Marche party and the UK\u2019s Liberal Democrats, while the Greens ate into the support of the traditional centrist groups including the Socialists and Democrats. Philippe Lamberts, a co-leader of the Greens in the parliament, said Weber should pull out of the race for the commission presidency as he had no chance of winning the support of enough national leaders. Macron said it would be a mistake to suggest the continued debate over the EU\u2019s leadership was a Franco-German power struggle. \u201cI\u2019m not locked up in any specific scheme, and our aim is to make emerge the best team for Europe,\u201d he said. The nominations by the leaders for the top posts are meant to reflect the strength of the EU\u2019s political groups and take into account geography and gender. There has never been a female president of the commission or council. Tusk has said he wants a conclusion to the talks by 2 July when the European parliament is due to choose its president or speaker. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said he was supporting a fellow liberal, Margrethe Vestager, a Dane who is currently the EU\u2019s competition commissioner, in the race to succeed Juncker. But he said the Dutch government did not have a position because there was \u201cno emerging candidate\u201d. Frans Timmermans, a Dutch national, also hopes to replace Juncker in the top job and is the candidate for the rival Socialists."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
