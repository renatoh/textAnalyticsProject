The 765 BBC staff is an increase on the 493 people the broadcaster sent to the Beijing Olympics in 2008. However, the corporation's staff numbers are dwarfed by the 2,700 journalists flown to London by the US TV network NBC. The BBC has aimed to position itself as the official broadcaster of the Olympics and has lined up presenters including Lineker, Sue Barker and Clare Balding to front its wall-to-wall coverage of the summer games. Dave Gordon, BBC Sport's head of major events, defended the staff numbers in an interview with Radio Times. \"Don't forget, NBC is flying 2,700 over from the USA. So we're pretty lean and mean,\" he said. \"I look on it as a reminder of how passionately the audience cares what the BBC does and the way we do it. We've a hard-earned reputation for doing the Olympics well.\" But the corporation is likely to face scrutiny from some quarters over its generous staffing levels. A number of BBC Sport staff are likely to incur logistical costs because they recently relocated to the corporation's new northern base in Salford. The BBC is turning BBC1 and BBC3 into its flagship Olympics channels, with BBC1 showing wall-to-wall coverage of the games except for traditional news bulletins. Gordon said he was confident the BBC would not face the kind of criticism it attracted for its coverage of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, but admitted the broadcaster will get nervous if Team GB's medal haul did not match expectations. \"Ultimately, one of the measures of the success of the Games and the success of our coverage will be how the British public feel about Team GB's performance. Say we have a barren first few days, we'll all get a little twitchy,\" he said. Games organisers expect up to 28,000 members of the media to descend on London over the summer, almost three times more than the number of athletes competing. Agence France-Presse is reputedly deploying a multilingual team of about 150 journalists and the global newswire and US newswire Associated Press will have around 200 staff on the ground. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
