She started yesterday morning as minister for women and equality. That was easy. The first question was about women being forced into slavery as prostitutes. It turned out that MPs were very much against that, and they didn't care who knew it. Then there was a question about \"gender dysphoria\". Dysphoria, according to Chambers, means \"morbid restlessness; absence of feeling of well-being\". According to Barbara Follett, who is Ms Harman's under-strapper, she is already on the case - after only seven days in the job! It seems there are many people who aren't happy with the sex they were born to, but don't want surgery to change it. So they go about feeling dysphoric. They are known, according to Ms Follett, as \"the trans community\". Whenever MPs use this \"community\" formula, a vision pops into my head of a real community, like Ambridge. Suppose that was a trans village? \"Eddie Grundy, get out of 'ere and muck out that cowshed!\" \"Aarr, urr, oid far rather be at Sid's lace-making class at the Bull. Moind yew, oi can't stand beer. Boibycham is good enough fur me loike it was good enough fur moi old dad!\" Then Harriet did a quick hat switch and became leader of the house. This could have been tricky. The Tories have been critical because she is also deputy leader and chair of the Labour party. They claim she may be too partisan to represent all MPs. How would she tackle this accusation? She didn't need too. Theresa May, her Tory opposite number, dug a trap for herself, covered it with twigs, then pressed a well-polished Russell &amp; Bromley shoe onto it, with predictable and enjoyable results. She went through a list of all the times Harriet had claimed to be leftwing in order to win the deputy leadership vote, and how she had miraculously changed her mind once she had got into the cabinet. She did this by demanding statements or debates on City bonuses, Trident, the power of trade unions (Harriet was very keen on them, since they had one-third of the party votes), and whether the government should apologise for the Iraq war. All these switches and evasions were true, and all were embarrassing. But you can't demand a non-partisan discussion by making a ferociously partisan speech. Ms Harman coolly replied that if the Tories wanted debates on these topics, they could have them in their allotted time. Then she said, with magnificent froideur: \"Perhaps I could offer a non-aggression pact. It is not in the interests of the house for you to give me a hand-bagging every Thursday, so I hope we can get over this.\" It was like a duchess reproving an over-familiar chambermaid, and quite superb."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
