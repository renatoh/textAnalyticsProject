The 49-year-old made the comments, which Kick It Out condemned as \u201cthoughtless racist stereotypes\u201d, on BBC Radio Derby\u2019s Sportscene show after Saturday\u2019s 1-1 draw with Huddersfield Town. The BBC said: \u201cThese were entirely unacceptable comments and we will no longer be working with Craig.\u201d Ramage, who was employed by the BBC on a freelance basis, said on social media that he apologised unreservedly: \u201cWhat I said was wholly inappropriate and unintentional. Race is irrelevant to the issues that I was discussing and I deeply regret what I said. I sincerely hope that the players accept my apology.\u201d Kick It Out had called on the BBC to take \u201ceffective action\u201d after Ramage, a former Derby and Watford midfielder, said on the programme, which has since been edited and re-uploaded online: \u201cWhen I look at certain players, their body language, their stance, the way they act, you just feel, hold on a minute, he needs pulling down a peg or two. \u201cSo I\u2019d probably say that about all the young black lads, all the young advice if they wanted it, that, you know, it\u2019s about, when you are struggling for form, you are going through a sticky patch, it\u2019s about going back to basics, working hard, and doing the right things.\u201d On Sunday the 22-year-old Derby defender Max Lowe flagged up Ramage\u2019s comments on social media, saying he \u201cdecided to speak out on behalf of all black footballers at Derby County\u201d. Lowe added on Instagram: \u201cRacial ignorance, stereotyping and intolerance negatively affects the image of impressionable young footballers and creates an unnecessary divide in society. I am also disappointed that a public service broadcaster did not step in to ask the analyst to explain his reasoning or to distance themselves from these archaic thoughts.\u201d The Kick It Out chairman, Sanjay Bhandari, said: \u201cThese comments are shocking and the views expressed are the kind of thoughtless racist stereotypes that we heard 50 years ago. We do not expect to hear them lazily trotted out in 2020. I expect effective action to be taken by the BBC. I support Max Lowe\u2019s comments and we offer our support to Max, Jayden Bogle and the young Derby players.\u201d Derby released a statement in which they said they had been in contact with the BBC, underlining that the club \u201ctake comments like these extremely seriously, we do not tolerate them, and stand shoulder to shoulder, together as one with all our players\u201d. The club\u2019s specialist first-team coach, Liam Rosenior, a member of manager Phillip Cocu\u2019s backroom staff, said the comments were \u201cunacceptable\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
