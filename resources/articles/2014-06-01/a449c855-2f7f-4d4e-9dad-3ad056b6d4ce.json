And they make you feel more than just full and healthy, it makes you feel a bit loved. An organic-delivery business with four farms scattered around the country, each of its boxes comes with an update on news from its mutual co-operative of British farmers, as well as details of all the produce inside. It collaborated on a two-year study with the University of Exeter to ensure every aspect of the business is as sustainable as possible, from the tomatoes it sells to the packaging it uses. Riverford's Twitter feed reveals a number of \"velfies\" (vegetable selfies), along with delighted customers' photos of the meals they've cooked with the produce from their boxes. And, this month, Riverford launched a new recipe-box concept. As well as vegetables, each delivery contains locally sourced organic meat, fish, dairy and dry goods, along with step-by-step cooking instructions. Not only will every recipe take less than 45 minutes to cook, but it guarantees prices will be 20% cheaper than organic produce bought from the supermarket.
