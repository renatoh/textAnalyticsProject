The rapper, born Belcalis Almanzar, turned herself in to police in October following the alleged assaults on two bartenders at the Angels Gentleman\u2019s Club in Queens, New York. The bartenders, who are also sisters, claim that Cardi and her entourage threw bottles and alcohol at them, and that one woman\u2019s head was slammed into the bar. Cardi allegedly accused one of the women of sleeping with her husband, the rapper Offset, of Atlanta trio Migos. Cardi B and associates Tawana \u201cRemyRojaLaPerla\u201d Jackson-Morel and Jeffrey \u201cAstonMartinChuck\u201d Bush have each been charged with 12 crimes, including assault, harassment and conspiracy. Jackson-Morel and Bush have also pleaded not guilty. Queens County acting district attorney John Ryan said that Cardi B and Jackson-Morel co-ordinated attacks on 15 and 29 August 2018 over social media, and allegedly discussed a financial exchange for carrying them out. In April, Cardi B rejected a plea deal that would have given her a conditional discharge, avoiding a prison sentence unless she committed a further offence. The defendants are likely to return to court in September. If convicted they face up to four years in prison. Drew Findling, lawyer for Cardi B, said he was confident of a \u201cfavourable outcome\u201d. Performing in Los Angeles last week, Cardi B told the crowd: \u201cI ain\u2019t going to jail.\u201d The rapper appeared in court days after winning best album and best female artist at this year\u2019s BET awards. She will appear on Ed Sheeran\u2019s forthcoming album, No 6 Collaborations Project, released on 5 July."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
