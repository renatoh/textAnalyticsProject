The Wallabies appear to have discarded the front-five flimsiness of last autumn and appear reinvigorated in all departments under their new coaching group, headed by John Connolly. The new boss's pack did a particularly destructive number on the Ireland line-out. Daniel Vickerman and Nathan Sharpe won their personal set-piece duels with Paul O'Connell and Donncha O'Callaghan and not many teams have managed that over the past nine months. Without their regular supply from the two second-rows, Ireland were always going to struggle. There was, however, a marked difference between the challenge of the Ireland and England Down Under. Even without the ball, Ireland were cohesive and confident in defence and defiant on scraps of possession. Even with plenty of ball, England had looked a shambles. Having given away, as has been their fashion on tour, an early batch of points - a penalty by Stirling Mortlock and a try by Chris Latham - and having nearly conceded a whole lot more, Ireland forced themselves on to the agenda with vigorous work at the tackle area. But they were still eight points adrift at the start of the second half. Then, suddenly, they scored with an inch-perfect diagonal kick from Ronan O'Gara. Shane Horgan caught the ball and, via two sweet flips to and from David Wallace, O'Gara finished what he had started. An even better try followed eight minutes later when Ireland turned the ball over and launched it through 10 pairs of hands to Neil Best. Denis Leamy - like Horgan, the No 8 has had a formidable tour - was twice involved. Thus, Ireland took the lead. Briefly. Their purple patch triggered an even more dynamic burst from Australia, who ran in four tries in the closing quarter. Wing Mark Gerrard ran past prop John Hayes, and Greg Holmes revealed that not all props are on the slow side as he galloped 40 metres after Lote Tuqiri had tumbled Andrew Trimble upside down, Gregan scored simply from a five-metre scrum and George Smith and Stephen Larkham composed a set of passes that put Cameron Shepherd into a large midfield gap. Australia are back and in form now for the Tri Nations. Ireland lost again to make it a hat-trick of defeats on tour. The last quarter again hurt them hard. But to be worn out after an hour at the dog end of a long season is not an indication of deep-rooted problems. Anything but. This has been as productive as a losing tour can possibly be. The results may look similar, but the English and Irish experiences on the other side of the globe have been entirely different.
