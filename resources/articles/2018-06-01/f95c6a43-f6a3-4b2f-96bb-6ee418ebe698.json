Whether Chris Kendall ultimately heard those calls is unclear and, while it is not hard to wonder what might have been for Leigh had the night\u2019s defining moment \u2013 the eighth-minute sending-off of their full-back, Peter Mata\u2019utia \u2013 not occurred, few could argue with Kendall channelling his inner Lindop following the horrendous suplex-style tackle on Matt Parcell. Though the game was in its infancy, the Championship side were already leading 6-0 and playing with the panache which saw them eliminate higher-ranked opposition, Salford, in the previous round, it was not unreasonable to assume Leigh would have at least made it a tiresome work\u2019s evening for Leeds in their battle to reach the semi-finals again. Within 15 minutes of Mata\u2019utia\u2019s dismissal Leeds had scored four tries without reply; by half-time they had crossed for three more to open up a 28-point advantage that, despite the gamely efforts of Leigh, was never likely to be troubled in front of yet another sparse Challenge Cup crowd \u2013 though the fact Leeds had to move this game to Featherstone due to the cricket at Headingley played a part in that. Moments like Mata\u2019utia\u2019s dismissal can often split opinion \u2013 but even his own coach was accepting of the decision which swung the contest in Leeds\u2019 favour from an early stage. \u201cWe saw it the same as you live \u2013 and it didn\u2019t look great,\u201d McDermott said. \u201cYes, it was a sending-off. The manner of victory for Leeds \u2013 who have lost their last three Super League games and slipped into mid-table \u2013 will be especially pleasing. But with an eight-week gap until the semi-finals in Bolton, arresting their Super League slump will be even tougher following yet more injuries to add to their ever-increasing list. Carl Ablett and Jimmy Keinhorst are set for prolonged spells on the sidelines, McDermott confirmed, but the emergence of young talent such as Mikolaj Oledzki and Jack Walker will at least give comfort to Rhinos fans that the future, as it so often is in Leeds, is bright. Walker in particular was a menacing influence all evening, scoring a try and having a hand in several more which put the hosts 40-12 ahead at half-time. Leigh, much to their credit, fought valiantly throughout \u2013 best underlined by the tries to Liam Hood and Ben Crooks in the final quarter. By then, though, Leeds had scored some magnificent tries \u2013 including one for Richie Myler, who combined superbly with Walker as Leigh toiled with their numerical disadvantage.
