Greenpeace Nordic and Norway\u2019s Nature and Youth organisation will appeal on Tuesday against the government\u2019s decision to allow oil exploration in parts of the Arctic Ocean on the grounds that it violates people\u2019s rights to a safe and healthy environment. The green groups are expected to argue that the decision would breach a constitutional law, known as section 112, that calls on the government to safeguard a healthy environment for existing and future generations. They also claim the plans would violate the Paris climate agreement. Norway has pledged to help tackle rising global carbon emissions by divesting fossil fuel investments from its trillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund, but the government has continued to support new oil projects. Total carbon emissions from the fossil fuel-rich country are forecast to climb by 16% this year compared with the year before, after oil companies drilled 130 oil and gas wells in 2019. The campaigners claim Norway\u2019s total exported greenhouse gas emissions are 10 times bigger than the domestic emissions from its production. Frode Pleym, the head of Greenpeace Norway, said: \u201cThe Norwegian government can no longer ignore the dangerous impact its exported oil is having on the climate. Climate change knows no borders. Oil is oil, no matter where it is burned, and the government needs to cancel all drilling for new oil in the Arctic. Not acting now violates the Paris agreement and Norway\u2019s own constitution. That is why we are back in court.\u201d The green groups first took the government to court in Oslo in 2017 after years of lobbying against oil exploration in the Arctic. The co-plaintiffs will have the backing of Friends of the Earth Norway and the Norwegian Grandparents Climate Campaign. The appeal comes weeks after the UN special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, David Boyd, delivered a stinging rebuke of the Norwegian government\u2019s oil expansion in a report calling for an end to the country\u2019s search for new oil. \u201cNorway should stop exploring for additional oil and gas reserves, stop expanding fossil fuel infrastructure, and harness Norwegian wealth and ingenuity to plan a just transition to a fossil fuel-free economy,\u201d he said. \u201cNorway, as one of the world\u2019s wealthiest nations and one of the world\u2019s leading producers of oil and gas, must accept substantial responsibility for leading efforts in mitigation, adaptation and addressing loss and damage.\u201d Gaute Eiterjord, the head of Nature and Youth in Norway, said it was deeply concerning to see Norway\u2019s government \u201cbury its head in the sand\u201d. \u201cIt is the government\u2019s obligation to safeguard a safe and healthy environment. The young generation, in Norway and all over the world, is worried about the prospect of an unsafe future,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
