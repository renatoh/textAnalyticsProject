The outspoken sports tycoon believes there will be a shift in power away from Manchester United this season, predicting that his Wigan side can capitalise on the champions' faltering early form at the DW Stadium on Saturday and that a fourth successive title will be beyond Sir Alex Ferguson. But Whelan does not envisage that power moving to Manchester City, and questions whether Sheikh Mansour's long-term ambitions for City will be sustained should Mark Hughes fail to deliver success in the immediate future. \"You can understand the enthusiasm that the Arabs have for the game because it is such a fabulous sport and it is so big worldwide. You can understand their excitement and why they are throwing money at it,\" the Wigan owner said. \"But that money makes every single Premier League club think: 'They could come in for one of our players,' and, instead of being realistic, clubs are asking \u00a310m for \u00a32m or \u00a33m players. That is purely because of the Arabs coming in and throwing money at it. And it can't last. Once the Arabs have been in and lost a lot of money and haven't won the title or the FA Cup, or not got into Europe, are they going to keep pouring money in? Their enthusiasm will wane unless City get fabulous success. You've got to say that the Arab money is good for the league but it has sent every transfer barmy this summer.\" Whelan, speaking at the launch of his autobiography, believes Champions League qualification will be beyond City this season and likewise the title for United, with the loss of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic to injury encouraging his hopes of witnessing a first victory over Ferguson as Wigan chairman this weekend. \"I don't think United will win the title this season. I think there will be a few surprises, with Tottenham possibly finishing in the top three, and if I had to pick one I would say Liverpool,\" he added. \"I thought United looked iffy against Birmingham City and Burnley were up for it at Turf Moor, as United will be when they come here. They won't want to get beat twice in a row. But they are missing some big players at the moment and if their two central defenders are out again then we will have a hell of a chance.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
