Klein, who is heading to Australia for a series of public events, said the level of inaction on climate change in Australia was only matched by her native Canada. \u201cIn Canada I can\u2019t tell where the oil industry ends and the government begins and in Australia the same is true when it comes to coal,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe Abbott government is repeating the talking points of the coal industry, the same stuff I heard at the Heartland Institute, that \u2018coal is good for humanity\u2019 and \u2018God bless coal\u2019. \u201cWe have elections in Canada in October and I hope we have a different government. If that happens, Australia will be isolated as a climate villain. At the moment we are giving you a run for your money.\u201d Klein, whose latest book, This Changes Everything, argues governments have fundamentally failed to deal with the issue of climate change, said Abbott\u2019s promotion of coalmines and the attempt to keep climate off last year\u2019s G20 agenda \u201ccrossed a line where it\u2019s impossible to come back from\u201d. \u201cOne part I find particularly shocking is that Australia is very much on the frontline of climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, being a Pacific nation, your closest neighbours are facing a truly existential threat. So I find it even more shocking that Australia is a hotbed of climate denial.\u201d Klein said climate change would exacerbate social problems such as racism and inequality, predicting Australia would become \u201cmeaner\u201d as it gets hotter. \u201cYou see that in Australia where the treatment of migrants is a profound moral crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that as sea levels rise that this mean streak and open racism is going to become more extreme \u2013 climate change is an accelerant to all those other issues.\u201d Abbott, who famously once called the science of climate change \u201ccrap\u201d, now insists he accepts human activity is influencing the climate. Last week the government unveiled an emissions reduction target of 26-28% by 2030, based on 2005 levels, which Abbott hailed as \u201cenvironmentally and economically responsible\u201d. But several scientists have claimed the target is not consistent with a worldwide effort to avoid the internationally agreed goal of avoiding 2C of global warming from pre-industrial times. According to the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology, climate change will hit Australia harder than many other countries, with a temperature increase of up to 5.1C by the end of the century if the burning of fossil fuels isn\u2019t curbed. In this scenario sea levels would rise by up to 82cm by 2090, the number of days with severe bushfire danger would increase, snow cover would decline and droughts would become more extreme. Klein said the denial of climate science was prevalent in English-speaking countries such as Australia, Canada, the US and the UK because of a \u201ccolonial settler mentality\u201d. \u201cCountries founded on a powerful frontier mentality have this idea of limitless nature than can be endlessly extracted,\u201d she said. \u201cClimate change is threatening to that because there are limits and you have to respect those limits. Where that frontier narrative is strongest is where denialism is strongest. \u201cThe rest of Europe has a keener sense of boundaries \u2013 they\u2019ve lived against the limits of nature for longer.\u201d Naomi Klein will speak at Melbourne writers festival on 29 and 30 August and the Festival of Dangerous Ideas, Sydney on 5 September"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
