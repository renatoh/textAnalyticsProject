But while England can look forward Scotland can look only back with regret after they were knocked out in dramatic circumstances in their final Group D game. The Scots blew a 3-0 lead inside the last 20 minutes to draw 3-3 with Argentina in Paris after they had looked in control of a third-place finish and a good chance of a place in the last 16. Scotland\u2019s woe was made all the more painful after the 90th-minute Argentina equaliser was awarded by a VAR decision, and then Lee Alexander saved the initial spot-kick only for a retake to be ordered because she had moved off her line too early. Florencia Bonsegundo made no mistake second time around to send the Scots out. \u201cIt\u2019s quite hard right now,\u201d said Scotland\u2019s manager, Shelley Kerr. \u201cObviously we were 3-0 up and looking quite comfortable. Their first goal changed the whole complexion. For 70 minutes we were very good and we didn\u2019t manage to see the game out, but at this moment in time we feel very hard done by. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to comment right now, but I think there were certainly a few decisions again which didn\u2019t go our way. This is a World Cup and you need the officials to make the right calls and I think there were a few that went against us. It\u2019s bitterly disappointing. But saying that we should still manage the game. We\u2019ll not take away that fact, but yes, bitterly disappointing. \u201cMy emotions \u2013 I need to spend a bit of time with the players. We\u2019re all devastated. We put so much into this game. Unfortunately we conceded three goals. It\u2019s very tough right now. It\u2019s still very raw. We need to pick up the players, because we put everything into that game.\u201d Neville, however was upbeat and insistent that England\u2019s new possession-based approach will not be compromised under any circumstances \u201cThe last 16 is about winning but the style is non-negotiable,\u201d said the Lionesses\u2019s coach at the end of a night when his side maintained their perfect start to the tournament but could equally easily have lost to a technically assured Japan. \u201cWe have to play with a certain style.\u201d England will not discover the identity of Sunday\u2019s round-of-16 opponents untilThursday after their third win in three games saw them top Group D. They will face one of the best third-place finishers in Valenciennes, near the Belgian border, after a victory conjured on an evening when, once again, Neville rotated heavily. While the recalled Ellen White scored twice, the newly introduced Georgia Stanway supplied a stunning assist on the half turn and the re-introduced Karen Bardsley made some vital saves, other players struggled. In central defence Millie Bright did not look to have recovered entirely from a shoulder injury but Neville stood by his selection with only three days\u2019 rest before the knockout stages begin. \u201cThis was my strongest team to play Japan,\u201d he said after making eight changes. \u201cCertain players are experts in certain games. That\u2019s what rotation is about. It\u2019s strategic. I think we picked a powerful team with strength and experience, we looked like we could score from every corner but their goalkeeper made some great saves.\u201d Neville acknowledged that Bardsley showed why \u201cshe\u2019s one of the top three keepers in the world,\u201d that \u201cwe could have passed the ball better at times,\u201d and \u201cWe needed the second goal,\u201d but was still not unhappy. \u201cWe were so open and fatigued in the second half that we got exposed a bit. But we got another win and another clean sheet. \u201cWe are where we want to be, ready to attack the business end of the competition. Japan are a team that play good football and know how to win. I\u2019m a massive fan of Japan\u2019s culture. The respect they show and the way they act. They play the right way and have some talented young players. They will be a massive force again.\u201d He possesses a gifted young player of his own in Stanway whose creation of White\u2019s first goal will linger long in the memory. \u201cIf she keeps her feet on the ground she\u2019s going to be one of the best players in world football,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has that potential.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
