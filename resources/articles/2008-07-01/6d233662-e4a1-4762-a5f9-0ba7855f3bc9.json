There you are, pony-tailed, thin as the gold-topped cane you occasionally dangle from your gloved hand and ruler of one of the world's great cash cows as the long-time creative director of Chanel, which held its couture show in Paris yesterday. No matter what the economic climate, no matter what the magazines deem to be in fashion this season, there are millions of women around the world who still want Chanel's quilted handbags, perfect tweed suits and two-tone pumps. It's a formula that was coined by the eponymous Coco Chanel in the early decades of last century and refined by Lagerfeld in the latter part, and it never seems to fail. Which, after a while, must get pretty boring for him. How many times can a man knock out another tweed suit? Don't they want to see what else he can do? Well, no, not really. Couture is the area in which a designer can afford to be a little more experimental, as he has the funds to carry it off without the pressure of commerciality that one has in ready-to-wear, which is expected to - well, you know - sell. So in yesterday's show, one saw Lagerfeld indulging his more extreme side. Alongside the perfect suits - almost all of which ended a few inches above the knee, continuing this couture week's trend of pitching to a younger customer - there were dresses with giant tubular pleats around the arms, giving the models a look that can only be described as robotic. Skirts blousoned out around the hips and then cinched in around the mid-thigh, rendering the models almost immobile. Most women, one might have thought, when they spend upwards of \u00a310,000 on a skirt would like, perhaps, to be able to walk in it. But when Lagerfeld returned to his simpler style, the clothes were, as ever, beautiful. In particular, the plush tweed grey and silver suits trimmed with sequins and feathers, and a full-length grey evening dress with a mini cape of grey roses falling over the model's shoulders. It may get dull for Lagerfeld, but for everyone else it is still a pleasure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
