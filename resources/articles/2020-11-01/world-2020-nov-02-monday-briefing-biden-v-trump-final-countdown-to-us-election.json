Let\u2019s orient ourselves in terms of UK timings: by lunchtime GMT on Tuesday polling booths will be opening in the mainland United States. Then on Wednesday morning we will be trying to work out what just happened. The presidential election is on track to have the highest voter turnout in more than a century, reflecting the high stakes in the race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. The US Elections Project says more than 93 million people had already voted as of Sunday. The project\u2019s co-ordinator, Prof Michael McDonald from the University of Florida, predicts 150 million Americans may vote, out of 239 million eligible voters. A wobble for the Democratic campaign after a poll in Iowa showed Trump ahead by seven points. He enjoyed the same lead there over Hillary Clinton before winning the state, and the election, in 2016. Biden is leading national polls but so did Clinton \u2013 here is how things are looking in crucial swing states. The mail-in votes that Trump has baselessly made an issue are expected to skew towards the Democrats. Donald Trump has defended as \u201cpatriots\u201d a mob of his supporters \u2013 some armed \u2013 who surrounded and menaced people on board a Joe Biden campaign bus in Texas. Trump has thrown the crowd some red meat at one of his campaign rallies by threatening to fire the hugely popular pandemic expert Anthony Fauci after the election \u2013 more on that at our live blog \u2013 while separately he foreshadowed \u201cgoing in with our lawyers\u201d straight after voting ends. But the president denied reports he is planning to declare victory as soon as it looks like he is ahead on the night \u2013 despite th the need to count postal ballots. Incredibly, police in North Carolina have responded to a get-out-the-vote rally by pepper-spraying participants because they temporarily blocked a road during a legally permitted, peaceful march. And not to sound overly dramatic but a group of scholars at universities in the US, Canada and Europe has warned that democracy \u201cis either withering or in full-scale collapse globally \u2026 Whether Donald J Trump is a fascist, a post-fascist populist, an autocrat or just a bumbling opportunist, the danger to democracy did not arrive with his presidency and goes well beyond 3 November 2020.\u201d They suggest citizens must be ready not only to defend democracy at the ballot box but \u201cif necessary, also through non-violent protests in the streets\u201d. * * * Coronavirus latest \u2013 Lockdowns like England\u2019s, due to come into force from Thursday, are a price countries are having to pay for failing to ensure infected people and their contacts self-isolate, according to Dr Margaret Harris of the World Health Organization. The WHO has consistently urged quarantining and contact tracing but Harris said in European countries there had been poor management of isolation. \u201c[People] don\u2019t feel a strong social obligation or they do not necessarily have that reinforced \u2026 In a place like Hong Kong you would be called every day, or the police come to your house.\u201d Taiwan \u201cprobably has the best management\u201d, notwithstanding being a \u201chighly liberal society\u201d. As if to illustrate the point, the WHO chief, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has put himself in strict quarantine after contact tracing revealed he\u2019d been near an infected person. Meanwhile \u201crapid turnaround\u201d coronavirus tests promised by Boris Johnson are not approved for the public to interpret without an expert\u2019s help and so will not provide results in the claimed 15 minutes, the Guardian has learned. And reports have emerged that Prince William tested positive for coronavirus around the same time his father was diagnosed but it went unannounced as he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to worry anyone\u201d.

Since February thousands of volunteers have used the charity\u2019s online tool to search historical maps for footpaths missing from today\u2019s official maps that are supposed to record legal rights of way. There are 9,000 miles missing in south-west England alone, while the West Midlands has the highest density of lost paths. The government has set a cutoff date of January 2026 after which it will no longer be possible to reclaim and safeguard lost rights of way. The Ramblers have launched a crowdfunder to support their campaign. * * * Depp libel verdict due \u2013 The high court in London is to hand down its ruling today in the libel case between Johnny Depp and the Sun newspaper, four months on from the courtroom battle between the actor and his ex-wife, Amber Heard. The Pirates of the Caribbean actor is suing News Group Newspapers (NGN) and the Sun\u2019s executive editor, Dan Wootton, over a 2018 article that labelled him a \u201cwife-beater\u201d. Depp is also bringing a separate claim against Heard in the US, suing her for $50m (\u00a338.7m) over a column she wrote. * * * Journalism mourns Robert Fisk \u2013 The veteran British foreign correspondent and author Robert Fisk has died at the age of 74. The Middle East correspondent for the Independent had reportedly been admitted to St Vincent\u2019s hospital, Dublin, following a stroke. In a storied career Fisk won the Orwell prize for journalism and multiple British Press Awards. He began his career at the Sunday Express before moving to the Times and was that paper\u2019s Belfast correspondent at the height of the Troubles in the 1970s. In 1976 he moved to Beirut, covering the Lebanese civil war, Iranian revolution, Iran-Iraq war and Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The fluent Arabic speaker was among the few western journalists to interview Osama bin Laden and did so three times. Today in Focus podcast: Why would you stick with Trump?

Lunchtime read: Crispy rolled pancake revolution In Thailand, wherever protests erupt, food is never far. Beyond the crowds of mostly young demonstrators rallying across the country calling for democratic reforms, food vendors line the streets, grilling rows of fish balls and pork balls, and frying chicken. Strings of sausages are draped over mobile carts ready for demonstrators who join rallies after school or work. Sellers are stocked with everything from crispy rolled pancakes to coconut ice-cream and bags of pickled mango. Even when gatherings were banned last month, prompting a cat-and-mouse game between protesters and police, food vendors were first on the scene \u2013 stationed in prime positions before journalists, the authorities and even many demonstrators arrived. For these food sellers, the escalating protest movement \u2013 which has surprised many with calls to reform the monarchy \u2013 is a welcome business opportunity.
