Because he is my captain he can transfer my philosophy on the pitch.\u201d Van Gaal said this despite having named Wayne Rooney as his official leader and Darren Fletcher his deputy. When United\u2019s media officer interrupted to say that Carrick is the vice-captain, Van Gaal continued: \u201cNext to Rooney he is my captain. Fletcher is also my captain. I have three captains but of course there is a sequence. Rooney is one, Carrick is two, Fletcher is three. In different lines of my team I have captains and that is very important. Maybe, that contribution is a big one.\u201d Placing aside the news that, in his brusque manner, Van Gaal appeared to have demoted Fletcher to third in line to the armband, the value of Carrick is left in no doubt. Since he returned to the starting line-up Van Gaal\u2019s team have reeled off six consecutive Premier League victories. Asked if this was a coincidence, the manager said: \u201cI think you give too much honour to Michael Carrick.\u201d Yet a sense remains that the upturn in form is a pleasing corollary of Carrick\u2019s reinstatement to the XI following the groin injury he suffered on England duty last month. The seasoned Carrick-watcher would surely agree, especially following a glance at his numbers since joining United in July 2006. Carrick has made 252 league appearances of which 215 have been starts. The headline statistic is that during his 19,396 minutes in a United shirt there have been 15,407 attempted passes of which 86.74% have been successful, illustrating why Carrick is so essential to United\u2019s control and rhythm. The meat on these statistical bones is what in terms of honours he has gained in eight seasons. Carrick has won five titles, the Champions League, the Fifa Club World Cup, the League Cup and was voted into the 2012-13 Premier League PFA team of the year \u2013 the same season that supporters judged him United\u2019s best player. Carrick was 25 when he was bought for close to \u00a319m from Tottenham Hotspur. Now he is the club\u2019s eldest statesman at 33, declaring recently with some bemusement: \u201cI\u2019m the oldest.\u201d The current campaign began with a disastrous pre-season ankle injury just as Van Gaal became manager. \u201cHe was great with me,\u201d Carrick recently told United Review. \u201cIt was pretty much his first day in the door when I got injured and I was going off for an operation on that day when he was coming in. It wasn\u2019t the ideal start but that\u2019s the way it goes.\u201d The injury ruled Carrick out until 2 October when he was forced into action earlier than expected at centre-back following Chris Smalling\u2019s red card in the Manchester derby defeat at the Etihad Stadium. Playing as a central defender has proved no one-off cameo. Van Gaal\u2019s much-trumpeted \u201cphilosophy\u201d demands ball-players to craft attacks from defence. Against Liverpool last weekend Carrick was among the star performers despite again operating in the rearguard. \u201cYou have to adapt because that\u2019s just how things have gone in recent weeks,\u201d he says of playing in defence. \u201cMaybe when the injuries settle down and we have more of a settled squad then it will be more consistent in terms of positioning.\u201d United have accumulated almost 50 injuries already this season. Daley Blind, another midfielder who can also slot into defence, is currently out. So are Smalling and the left-back Luke Shaw while the right-back Rafael Da Silva was last in action at the end of October. \u201cYou have to be ready to deal with injuries,\u201d Carrick says. \u201cIt has happened a few times this season and the more it does, the easier it gets. I class myself as a midfielder and probably always will. I might have spells at centre-back, as I have over the last few years, but I have played for that long in midfield that I can\u2019t class myself as anything other than a midfielder. \u201cI feel good and I feel fresh. Obviously I missed a lot of football at the start of the season but I\u2019m enjoying it. When you are out for so long you really miss it, so I am just happy to be back playing and looking forward to the games ahead. You just try to play your own game. When you are out you do think about how your return will go and it\u2019s hard to judge where you\u2019re at in terms of fitness and match sharpness but things have gone all right.\u201d United are third, eight points behind Chelsea. Given the injuries and Van Gaal\u2019s need to bed in, that is an impressive position as Christmas nears. \u201cHe has a slightly different approach to what we\u2019ve had over the years,\u201d Carrick adds. \u201cBut I think you can see in the way we\u2019ve played over recent weeks that there is a real pattern and identity emerging. You can see it is his team. Everyone is taking it on and improving. I\u2019m enjoying it and I don\u2019t think you can ever stop learning. You are always picking up new ideas and new ways of playing.\u201d On Friday Van Gaal also said: \u201cI like multi-functional players.\u201d As a princely midfielder, auxiliary defender and de facto captain, Carrick is a perfect fit for the manager."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
