They urged the prime minister consider the number of children in their home country who would be killed or maimed if Britain and the United States launched military strikes against Saddam Hussein's regime. The seven Iraqi youngsters, who were joined by a brother and sister born in Egypt and a young Palestinian boy, handed over the cards to Number 10 as part of an ongoing campaign by the Stop the War coalition. Written on the backs of the cards were messages to Mr Blair from thousands of people from around the UK. One message, referring to the recent controversy involving the Blairs' purchase of two flats in Bristol, one of which was intended for their son Euan, read: \"Dear Tony, you invested half a million pounds in your son's future happiness - don't Iraqi children deserve the same consideration?\" Fatima Mahmoud, 17, who was born in Egypt but now lives in London, said as she stood on the doorstep of Number 10: \"I don't think the case for war is strong enough because weapons inspectors have said there is no real evidence that Iraq has nuclear weapons. \"A lot of very very innocent children, the same age as those here, will die. \"If I could speak to Tony Blair I would try to reach out to him and ask him, how could you live with these children's blood on your hands?\" Ahmed Al-Tamimy, 18, originally from Baghdad but now living in London, said: \"Tony Blair won't get anything out of attacking Iraq, as it is going to end up killing more children. I would ask him, please think of the consequences. \"He is not going to only kill the children of Iraq, he is going to kill British people at the same time, because it will increase the chances of terrorists attacking this country. I don't want that to happen because I live here.\" Ahmed Ayad, 18, said: \"We hope Tony Blair listens to us but I don't think he will. I would say he is heartless.\" The cards featured a picture of a crying and injured child next to a quote from former chief UN weapons inspector, Scott Ritter, who resigned in protest in 1998. He said: \"We would never allow 500,000 Jewish children to starve to death, we would never allow 500,000 British children to starve to death. It is racial politics, we all know that.\" The Stop the War coalition, which is planning a demonstration in London on February 15, says 500,000 children have died since sanctions were imposed on Iraq following the first Gulf war in 1991, and believes more children will suffer as a result of war. Andrew Burgin, of the Stop the War coalition, said: \"People are talking about war so blithely at the moment, as if there is no human cost but people often do not realise the human cost.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
