But at the end of this first gaffe-strewn week of the general election campaign, the prime minister has barely met a voter \u2013 aside from the Northern Irish manufacturers he addressed in a rambling speech on Thursday evening, during which he appeared to misconstrue his own Brexit deal. It certainly was not the start the prime minister would have hoped for. The week began with Jacob Rees-Mogg being forced to apologise over remarks about the Grenfell Tower fire, and continued with Alun Cairns resigning as Welsh secretary over his support for a former aide whose testimony caused a rape trial to collapse. Tory advisers were not shrugging off the seriousness of the Rees-Mogg comments or the Cairns debacle, saying the response to both of them indicated they knew both could have spiralled badly. \u201cThey weren\u2019t problems of our own making. So we did the only thing we could to make them not problems any more as fast as possible,\u201d says one aide. The same approach was taken again on Thursday night when a Tory candidate withdrew after being heavily criticised for having once said women should keep their knickers on to avoid rape. After the disastrous start to the campaign, weary and worried cabinet ministers piled on a train to Birmingham on Wednesday night for the prime minister\u2019s first stump speech of the campaign \u2013 some, such as the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, in first class and others such as the departing culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, braving it in standard along with hordes of journalists. The event itself was like no previous Tory eve-of-election gathering. It had shades of a \u201cCameron direct\u201d event where the former PM used to address activists with his sleeves rolled up, speaking without notes. But Johnson\u2019s stunt really had more in common with the atmosphere of a Donald Trump or Jeremy Corbyn rally \u2013 albeit with a much smaller fan base than either of them. A few hundred activists had turned up to welcome the prime minister, and were offered free XXL T-shirts bearing Tory campaign slogans in garish colours. They then brandished giant placards and chanted \u201cBoris, Boris\u201d as the prime minister came on to rock music. The effect on the television was to present Johnson as surrounded by adoring fans, but when the cameras panned out it was obvious the spectacle was taking place in one small corner of a cavernous exhibition hall. After providing a smiling, cheering backdrop, cabinet ministers traipsed back to London again \u2013 eating Subway sandwiches on the way from the only open eatery at Birmingham International railway station. No 10 advisers have now moved over from Downing Street to Conservative party headquarters (CCHQ), where the team is led by Isaac Levido, the former right-hand man to the Australian election guru Sir Lynton Crosby. Levido, along with Michael Brooks, the party\u2019s pollster, sits at the centre of the room along with the campaign\u2019s digital leaders. However, there is no confirmation about the whereabouts of Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s controversial chief of staff who was due to have an operation in November. He told special advisers last week that Levido was \u201cin charge\u201d. The election war room is so crowded that CCHQ is scrambling for extra desks, with a particularly big press team and social media operation \u2013 partly to compensate for the weaknesses of 2017\u2019s digital operation when the Tories found themselves outgunned online by Labour and Momentum. Cabinet ministers are also not being dispatched to many big campaign events this time, according to one adviser, supposedly because it eats into the limited spending budgets of local candidates. This leaves all their press aides stuck in CCHQ, staffing the phones and a rebuttal unit. On Thursday, Johnson made a lightning visit to Moray in the north-east of Scotland, in a region where the Scottish Tories seized five of six available Westminster seats from the Scottish National party in 2017. Despite this potentially friendly territory, his preference for spending as little time in Scotland and being as far away from ordinary voters as possible \u2013 one trait he shares with his predecessor Theresa May \u2013 was evident. Johnson was questioned at length by journalists, who were perhaps irritable having been cooped up in a small room for several hours awaiting his arrival, about why his visits to Scotland since the summer had taken place in secure locations away from the general public, including a shipyard in Govan and Faslane nuclear base. He insisted: \u201cI\u2019ve met many, many Scottish voters in the course of my time as prime minister and look forward to meeting many more.\u201d Pressed on where and when these meetings had occurred, he repeated that he had met Scottish voters \u201cloads of times\u201d. When the Guardian suggested that this was not the case, Johnson joked: \u201cYou\u2019re a voter aren\u2019t you?\u201d After touring a rural distillery near Elgin for little more than an hour, Johnson was driven back to RAF Lossiemouth, and from there flew to Northern Ireland. His meeting there with Northern Irish businesses, footage of which has gone viral, underscored why getting out among the public and speaking his mind may not be quite such an advantage for the prime minister as it was in 2016, when he was still regarded as a plucky outsider."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
