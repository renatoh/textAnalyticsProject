Which seems as good a reason as any for the gloriously surreal standup to perform a 90-minute work-in-progress version of the classic Victorian novel. Bout Summerhall Some of the festival\u2019s best dance is in its Taiwan season. Chang Dance Theatre are four brothers who create deeply personal and sweetly soulful shows about growing up together. Their new piece, Bout, is inspired by the rituals and rhythms of boxing. Phil Wang: Philly Philly Wang Wang Pleasance Courtyard No standup was more conspicuously absent from 2017\u2019s Edinburgh award shortlist than Phil Wang. After a year away from the fringe, the former engineering student is back with a new set of supremely constructed gags. 111 (one hundred and eleven) Emerald theatre, Greenside The inclusive dance company Candoco reached a huge new audience when they performed with the BBC\u2019s Strictly professionals in 2018. Candoco\u2019s Joel Brown, a paraplegic dancer, duets with Eve Mutso, former principal dancer with Scottish Ballet, in a piece about power and vulnerability. When the Birds Come Underbelly, Cowgate Tallulah Brown\u2019s Songlines was one of 2018\u2019s most lovable plays: a bumpy countryside romance accompanied by haunting tunes from Brown\u2019s band Trills. Her new drama is about a family \u2013 and climate \u2013 crisis in Alaska. Anguis Gilded Balloon The Bob Dylan drama Girl from the North Country showed Sheila Atim to be a mightily talented actor-singer with a tight connection to your heart. In her debut as a writer, she deconstructs myths about the life and death of Cleopatra. Baby Reindeer Roundabout @ Summerhall Richard Gadd\u2019s Monkey See Monkey Do was a searing, bizarre and brave hour of comedy from a standup on a treadmill. It rightly won the Edinburgh comedy award and now Gadd is back performing his own play about obsession and delusion. Rosie Jones: Backward Pleasance Courtyard For a comedy newcomer, Rosie Jones has striking control of the audience, joyously toying with perceptions of her cerebral palsy. The jokes unfold slowly; punchlines come from nowhere. Jones likes to hand out humbugs \u2013 hazardous if you\u2019re laughing this hard. Daughterhood Roundabout @ Summerhall Charley Miles has the honour of reopening Leeds Playhouse this autumn with a superb drama about women living through the Yorkshire Ripper\u2019s reign of terror. But first she brings a new play about two sisters, one of whom cares for their dad, to Edinburgh\u2019s essential pop-up stage. Zo\u00eb Coombs Marr: Bossy Bottom Monkey Barrel Australian comic Zo\u00eb Coombs Marr has previously stormed Edinburgh in the guise of the sexist, tinny-swigging ocker Dave and as one-third of the bare-bottomed, critic-baiting Wild Bore. This year she\u2019s just doing a few jokes. Or so she says \u2026 Chores Assembly George Square Gardens Presented by Australian company Hoopla Clique, this could be one of the most anarchic family shows at the fringe. Two jaw-dropping acrobats refuse to tidy their room and instead kid around with pranks, each outdoing the other. Watch out when they wield the toiletpaper guns. #HonestAmy Pleasance Dome A ukulele comedy directed by Kathy Burke? Why not? Amy Booth-Steel performs the story of how the four-stringed instrument came to her rescue when she had mental health problems. Larky songs that will strike a chord with many. \u2022 The Edinburgh festival fringe runs 2-26 August."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
