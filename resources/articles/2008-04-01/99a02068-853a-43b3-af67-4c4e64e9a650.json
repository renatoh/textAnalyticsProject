Sarah Brightman put in serious time as a member of Hot Gossip; Elaine Paige dragged up as an elderly cat; Connie Fisher left a lucrative career in telesales; and Summer Strallen agreed to live an eerie half-life, appearing as a plant in Hollyoaks before she took the stage. Your best bet at meeting Lloyd Webber now is on his latest talent show - I'd Do Anything, BBC1's quest to fill his next production of Oliver. It's laid out like a stage school with Lloyd Webber squatting in the middle on a plastic throne. He's got a face on him, hasn't he, that one? But it doesn't matter to you, an aspirant Nancy, because every second brings you a step closer to this, the chance to emote for Andy, live-ish, on prime-time TV. And then to pretend to be a battered woman behind Oxford Street, twice nightly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
