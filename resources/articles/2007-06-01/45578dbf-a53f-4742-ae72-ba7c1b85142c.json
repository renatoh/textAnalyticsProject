Mr Blair's single biggest failure of judgment continues to haunt his successor. The fall-back position of the outgoing cabinet (they apologised for faulty intelligence, but not for the invasion which removed Saddam) does not help the incoming one address the central challenge: how to manage withdrawal. David Miliband, the new foreign secretary, has only to read the speech that the US Republican Senator Richard Lugar made on Monday. A former supporter of George Bush on the war, Senator Lugar said the current strategy of increasing the number of troops in Baghdad would only put back the day when Washington dramatically revised its policy. Arguing for a substantial, but not total, troop withdrawal now, he said three factors - the balkanisation of Iraqi society, the punishment the US army was taking in falling morale and recruitment, and the US domestic political timetable - all militated against the aim of creating a stable government in Baghdad. Better, he said, to work on plan B now: a tactical withdrawal of troops, a diplomatic offensive to include Iraq's neighbours and reducing dependence on Gulf oil. As independent research and our own reporting confirms, neither the \"surge\" in Baghdad nor Operation Sinbad in Basra is showing any signs of working. Foreign troops can clear areas, but Iraqi forces can not hold them. The militias, from which Iraqi security forces are inseparable, return to fight another day. The very least Mr Miliband should do is to stop pretending that current policies are working. He should follow his natural instincts on Iraq and Israel. In September he told the New Statesman that he did not think Israel's invasion of Lebanon had made it more secure or had advanced its declared aim of a two-state solution. If the Middle East is about managing failure, both Europe and Africa represent opportunities. The appointment of Mark Malloch Brown, as minister for Africa, Asia and the UN, can only enhance Britain's voice in the development debate. Even with a successful international negotiator like Chancellor Angela Merkel, Germany is uncomfortable assuming the leadership of Europe, and the newly elected French president Nicolas Sarkozy also requires support. Mr Miliband is naturally more pro-European than Mr Brown was as chancellor, and he should not hide that. He once called the EU the Environment Union, but the same case for collective action can be made on trade, energy security, foreign policy and Russia. It is time Britain became pragmatically European."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
