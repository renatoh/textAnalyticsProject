He'll go to the Boylesports [at Cheltenham on 12 December]. There's a possibility he'll have a trip to Ireland at some stage. Of course, most of the opposition is over there \u2013 Solwhit and Hurricane Fly and all sorts of things' Punjabi 'In a perfect world he will go Fighting Fifth, Christmas Hurdle, probably the Kingwell at Wincanton, Champion Hurdle and Punchestown.
