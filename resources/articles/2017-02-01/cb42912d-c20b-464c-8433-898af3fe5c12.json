Arsenal, 12 times the FA Cup winners, travel to Gander Green Lane on Monday evening in their first match since the devastating 5-1 defeat by Bayern Munich in the first leg of their last-16 Champions League tie to face Sutton, who have beaten Colchester United, Cheltenham Town, AFC Wimbledon and Leeds United to reach this stage of the competition. Wenger, 67, hinted over the weekend that he intends to follow Sir Alex Ferguson in managing into his 70s despite intense speculation that he could finally be ready to leave the post he has held for more than 20 years after the defeat by Bayern. But the Frenchman said he is more immediately concerned about how to combat Sutton\u2019s artificial playing surface. \u201cFirstly, the pitch,\u201d said Wenger when asked what are the biggest dangers facing his team. \u201cSecondly, their enthusiasm. Thirdly if we are not ready for a big fight. Subconsciously if we think \u2018no matter, it\u2019s a non-league team, we will pass\u2019, that will not happen. Ideally we would like to play on a normal pitch. But it has been accepted so \u2026 competition is also about dealing with what you face. We face an artificial pitch and we have to deal with it.\u201d Arsenal\u2019s players have practised on a 3G pitch at their London Colney training ground this week, although Wenger believes they will face a different challenge against the club who saw off Coventry at the same venue in 1989. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same because it\u2019s a dry pitch and I\u2019ve heard that Sutton have a wet pitch, they water it before the game so it\u2019ll be much quicker,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means the weight on the joints is stronger, you cannot glide, you have to block every time so it makes football a bit different because the ball comes to you and somebody accelerates and doesn\u2019t slow down like in a normal game so you have to get used to the difference in speed.\u201d Danny Welbeck has confirmed he will not feature in the tie against Sutton as he continues his return from injury due to fears over the pitch. The England striker played for Arsenal\u2019s Under-23 side on Sunday but admitted he did not want to risk himself on the unusual surface. \u201cGlad to get 70 minutes today to build up my match fitness. Plastic pitch at Sutton isn\u2019t the best idea at the moment,\u201d he tweeted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
