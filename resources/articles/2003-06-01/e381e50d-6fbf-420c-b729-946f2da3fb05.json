The shoddy work and rip-off tactics of cowboy builders has become Britain's number one consumer complaint, according to the Department of Trade and Industry. Botched home improvement work wastes \u00a31.5bn annually and over 106,000 complaints about cowboy builders were registered with trading standards officers in 2002. This is widely thought to be just the tip of the iceberg, with official complaints growing at a rate of around 5% a year. How to complain about the cowboys If you have been the victim of a rogue trader, the good news is that many disputes are settled quickly and amiably - but it will help if you know what to do. Firstly you need to know you have basic rights under the law, even if nothing is written down. You can expect that work be \u00b7 carried out with reasonable care and skill \u00b7 finished in a reasonable time (unless a specific time has been agreed) \u00b7 provided at a reasonable cost if you have not agreed a specific price (although you should always try to agree a fixed price in advance) You should then know how to complain effectively. Firstly, give your trader a chance to put things right. If you are still not satisfied, put your complaint in writing: write to the head office if there is one. Explain what you want doing and set a deadline. Ensure you keep copies of letters, photos and a diary of events. Make a note of any conversations, especially about prices. Some trade associations have codes of practice for their members to follow. These should give you basic guidance about what are considered to be reasonable standards of work. If the trader belongs to an association, there may be a conciliation or arbitration scheme; however, a dispute can only go to arbitration if both sides agree to participate. As a last resort, you could consider withholding payment. If you have any kind of credit agreement, think carefully before you withhold payments as your future credit rating could be affected. If you paid by credit card, the lender is jointly liable with the trader for any breach of contract (if the work costs between \u00a3100 and \u00a330,000). Tell the lender if there is a dispute. In extreme cases, you can take your contractor to court. Citizens Advice Bureaux and consumer advice centres have leaflets explaining how the small claims procedure works and can help you to fill out the necessary forms. They may also be able to give free legal advice. You may need to get an expert opinion to back up your complaint. A different contractor may charge you for giving an expert opinion. You can report rogue traders using the DTI/Trading Standards website ripofftipoff.net. How to find reputable tradesmen Despite the horror stories, there are reputable builders out there - and there are a number of ways to find them. Word of mouth remains by far the best method. However, if you do not know of anyone who has had a happy experience with builders, you might want to consider driving around your neighbourhood and knocking on any houses with skips or scaffolding outside. Most people will be glad to talk, either to grumble or boast of having found a good builder. It is also worth asking at your local independent hire shop. The staff will at least know which builders pay their bills on time and should be able to recommend a few firms. You could also get a list of recommended builders from your home insurer. Churchill take this one step further. The insurer's customers have access to 24-hour advice and helpline - so if they have a leaking tap they can call up for a list of plumbers in their area. Similarly, if they have burst pipes or another emergency, for example, Churchill will send an approved building contractor round to contact them within 24 hours. The internet is another good place to research tradespeople. Download the OFT's useful guide to employing tradespeople, 'Need a plumber or builder' at oft.gov.uk/comsumer. Improveline.com has a searchable directory of 150,000 screened builders, roofers, architects, electricians, plumbers, decorators and carpenters. Just type in what you are looking for and your postcode, and a list of firms appears on your screen. You then have to submit your email if you want to find out more about each firm, including other people's feedback. Up to three interested contractors should ring you back. The site also gives sample costs for a variety of projects. To find six reputable builders in your area, search the National Federation of Builders members' database at builders.org.uk. Mark of quality The Quality Mark building scheme was launched by the DTI last year to deal with the rising number of complaints about dodgy builders. Members of the scheme must pass standards and inspections, and work is guaranteed for up to six years after it has been carried out. Tradesmen with a turnover of less than \u00a31m can sign up free of charge, but firms with larger turnovers must pay. The scheme works by placing contact details of builders and tradesmen who reach the standard required by the Quality Mark on a single national register. To access the Quality Mark register, visit the website on qualitymark.org.uk. \"We welcome any move to prevent consumers getting ripped off,\" says a spokesperson at the National Consumer Council which is campaigning for a one-stop-shop information service on the track record of traders. \"From the customer's point of view, the Quality Mark comes with guarantees and a form of redress. But with the current boom in the housing industry, there's plenty of work available for tradespeople so there's little incentive for them to join the scheme. The jury is still out on the scheme's effectiveness as its still in its infancy, but it's a step in the right direction.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
