It has been crushed again by racism", "bodyText": "\u2018You can\u2019t delete racism. It\u2019s like a cigarette. You can\u2019t stop smoking if you don\u2019t want to, and you can\u2019t stop racism if people don\u2019t want to.\u201d Six years have passed since Mario Balotelli spoke those words in an interview with Sports Illustrated. He was on top of the world, Italy\u2019s No 9 and fresh from a triumphant half-season at Milan. Signed from Manchester City during the January transfer window, he had scored 12 times in 13 games, carrying Milan to third place. The magazine\u2019s front cover depicted him walking on water. Yet even when so much seemed possible for the striker whose goals had obliterated Germany at Euro 2012, Balotelli acknowledged his powerlessness to stop football fans in his home country from abusing him for the colour of his skin. Returning to Italy this summer, after stints away at Liverpool, Nice and Marseille, he wondered if things had changed. \u201cI hope with all my heart there won\u2019t be any repeat of the things that happened when I was last here,\u201d he said after signing for Brescia. \u201cI hope Italy has taken some steps forward.\u201d He was destined to be disappointed. The Serie A season has witnessed several instances of players being racially abused, from Romelu Lukaku at Cagliari to Dalbert at Atalanta and Ronaldo Vieira during a home game for Sampdoria against Roma. On Sunday, Balotelli was the target for monkey chants during Brescia\u2019s game at Verona. In the 55th minute, he responded. Fighting to keep the ball in play down by the corner flag, Balotelli turned suddenly and lashed it up towards supporters. Chaos ensued. The referee, Maurizio Mariani, booked Balotelli for unsportsmanlike behaviour. Balotelli threatened to walk off. Players from both teams intervened, talking Balotelli down while also informing officials of the abuse he had received. Mariani waved off the yellow card and suspended the game, instructing the stadium announcer to warn fans it would be abandoned if the chants continued. After a delay of almost five minutes, play resumed. Verona, already leading through a goal from Eddie Salcedo, extended their advantage through Matteo Pessina. Balotelli responded with a spectacular strike from the edge of the D, struck first time off his right instep into the top corner. It was not enough to rescue Brescia from a 2-1 defeat. The situation only got worse after the final whistle, when the Verona manager, Ivan Juric, flatly denied any racist abuse had taken place. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to say that nothing happened,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was loud whistling and mockery but no racist chant. There was nothing. I am a Croatian and I hear \u2018Gypsy piece of shit\u2019 sometimes because unfortunately that is the tendency in Italy but today there was nothing.\u201d What possessed him to take such a hard line only he can know. In any case, he was wrong. Juric might not have heard the monkey chants but several of his players did and they were plainly audible on a fan-shot video that circulated on Sunday evening. This has too often been the default mode for clubs whose fans stand accused of racist chanting: to mount an aggressive defence first \u2013 often calling into question the integrity of the victim \u2013 and ascertain the facts of what happened later. The Verona president, Maurizio Setti, supported his manager\u2019s line, claiming his team\u2019s supporters were simply \u201csarcastic, not racist\u201d. Verona will likely be punished. The independent observer sent to monitor this game heard the racist chants and included them in the official report \u2013 something that did not happen when Lukaku and Dalbert were verbally abused and which should allow the sporting justice greater scope for punishment. Still, there are ambiguities that make the verdict hard to predict. According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, the observer only ascribed the monkey chants to a group of about 15 fans. Balotelli was booed and whistled by many more but we are into murky territory. What constitutes racist abuse rather than jeering of an opponent? Regardless of the outcome, the discouraging thought is that once again nothing will change. This was a weekend when Roma\u2019s game against Napoli was also suspended in response to territorial discrimination from Roma\u2019s ultras. The initial warning from the stadium announcer was roundly ignored. Only the intervention of Edin Dzeko, encouraging fans to drown out the chants with cheers, seemed to get things back on track. Balotelli\u2019s assessment that you cannot force people not to be racist rings as true as ever. On the other hand, Italian football cannot absolve itself of responsibility. Clubs in other countries do a far more effective job of identifying individuals who engage in racist chanting and keeping them out of the stands. This is a slow process and even with maximum commitment could not be achieved overnight. It is hard to see how it will ever happen at clubs whose first instinct is to accuse a victim of making it up. Talking points \u2022 Defeat for Brescia meant the sack for Eugenio Corini \u2013 the manager who steered them to promotion. His team have taken one point from their past six games, but to me this still felt premature. This has been a gruelling run, including games against Juventus, Inter, Napoli and Fiorentina \u2013 none of whom beat them by more than a single goal. \u2022 Roma leapt up to third by beating Napoli in a hugely entertaining game, and Paulo Fonseca really does seem to have his team moving on a positive trajectory despite a long injury list. Nicol\u00f2 Zaniolo opened the scoring with a wonderful left-foot finish \u2013 marking his fourth straight game with a goal \u2013 and even Javier Pastore is playing well now that he\u2019s back in his preferred home at No 10. Chris Smalling once again played his part, too, with an acrobatic clearance off the line. \u2022 When is a handball not a handball? Don\u2019t ask Matthijs De Ligt, who was not punished in the Turin derby when the ball struck his arm in almost identical pose to that in which it had done so when he gave away a penalty against Lecce. This time: no spot-kick \u2013 a contrast that only looked sharper after Juventus edged to a 1-0 victory over their city rivals, courtesy of a volley from the defender himself. \u2022 Is it time to start viewing Cagliari as serious contenders for the Champions League? They won 2-0 away to Atalanta, drawing level on points with the Bergamo club and Lazio in fourth place. The Sardinians were aided by a first-half red card to Josip Ilicic but the 23-year-old Uruguayan Christian Oliva was magnificent in midfield. His only previous start came away to Napoli, where Cagliari also won, 1-0. \u2022 Two more goals for Romelu Lukaku, who rescued Inter after they fell behind at Bologna. He has nine in Serie A already, placing him second only to Ciro Immobile \u2013 who is already on 13 for Lazio."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
