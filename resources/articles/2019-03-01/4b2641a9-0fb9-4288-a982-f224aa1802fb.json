A Church of England bishop and a former director of public prosecutions led the chorus of outrage directed at the home secretary as demand grew for him to review his controversial decision to strip the 19-year-old of British citizenship \u2013 a move that left her stateless and her baby in legal limbo. \u201cThis was an abject decision by a home secretary apparently so intent on furthering his leadership ambitions that he has lost sight of sovereignty, treating the UK as a banana republic incapable of regulating its own citizens,\u201d said Lord Macdonald, who was director of public prosecutions of England and Wales between 2003 and 2008. The peer, who oversaw a 2010 government review of counter-terrorism and security powers, told the Observer that Javid\u2019s \u201copportunism has other costs, including a more dangerous world where stateless individuals roam with no allegiance, and the death of unprotected innocents, in this case a vulnerable British baby\u201d. And he warned of blowback to the UK. \u201cNo dignified self-governing state should abandon responsibility for its own citizens in this way, trying to dump them on to poorer countries with failed security arrangements. Mr Javid\u2019s behaviour is a recipe for refugee chaos and moral cowardice of the worst sort,\u201d he said. The bishop of St Albans, the Rt Rev Dr Alan Smith, said: \u201cShe should come back, be properly interviewed and, if it\u2019s found that she has broken the law, she should face the law. If it\u2019s found that she has been radicalised, she should be given help and support. \u201cThe home secretary has a responsibility to ensure people in this country are protected. We could have done this by taking her through due process and it is to be regretted if we are not following it, because this is a human rights issue.\u201d Begum, from Bethnal Green, east London, was 15 when she and two other schoolgirls went to join Isis in February 2015. She gave birth in a Syrian refugee camp last month, having already lost two children. News that a third child had now died has left her relatives in London distraught. The lawyer for Begum\u2019s family, Tasnime Akunjee, said: \u201cThey are utterly crushed and despondent at the moment.\u201d Javid\u2019s decision to strip the teenager of her British citizenship triggered a ferocious debate over whether she should be allowed to return and raised questions about the legality of his decision. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott tweeted yesterday: \u201cIt is against international law to make someone stateless, and now an innocent child has died as a result of a British woman being stripped of her citizenship. This is callous and inhumane.\u201d Lib Dem home affairs spokesperson Ed Davey said: \u201cMany of us feared this tragic outcome when the home secretary washed his hands of Britain\u2019s responsibility for a British citizen and a British baby. If the courts eventually show he has acted illegally in making a British citizen stateless, we will remember this baby in holding him to account.\u201d Several fellow Conservative MPs have also expressed anger at Javid\u2019s position. Bracknell MP Phillip Lee said he was deeply concerned by the decision, which he believed was \u201cdriven by a sort of populism\u201d. Anna Soubry, who left the Tories to join the Independent Group, tweeted that Javid must now restore Begum\u2019s citizenship. \u201cShamima Begum is our responsibility, whatever she may or may not have done, however abhorrent her views,\u201d she said. There are claims that Javid did not consult either the attorney general or the solicitor general before making his decision, something that could leave him vulnerable in the event of a legal challenge. When asked if this was the case, a Home Office spokesman said: \u201cWe do not comment on individual cases.\u201d Javid confirmed last month that Jarrah was a British citizen and said that he had considered the child\u2019s interest when deciding to revoke Begum\u2019s citizenship. But he told the Commons home affairs committee that it would be \u201cincredibly difficult\u201d for the government to facilitate the return of a child from Syria. Conservative party chairman Brandon Lewis defended Javid. \u201cThe home secretary will have had advice and I know he made a decision based on what is in the national interest and the security of people here in the UK,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThere is no question that the duty of a home secretary in this country is to keep British people safe.\u201d Begum\u2019s family in the UK are understood to be exploring their legal options, including bringing a private prosecution against the home secretary. Tasnime Akunjee said he will soon be flying out to Syria to help Begum prepare her appeal. \u201cI\u2019m going to Syria to meet somebody who has lost three kids, so I can show her some paperwork which is quite dense, and so I can obtain her signature. It\u2019s totally ridiculous,\u201d said the lawyer. Begum\u2019s father, Ahmed Ali, speaking to the BBC from Bangladesh before he found out his daughter\u2019s baby had died, apologised to the British people but asked for their forgiveness, saying his daughter should be allowed back to the UK and \u201cpunished if she had made any mistake\u201d. \u201cShe was under age at that time, she couldn\u2019t understand that much. I suppose someone influenced her to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cI admit that she might have done wrong without realising it.\u201d Outside east London mosque on Saturday, few people wanted to discuss Begum\u2019s situation. \u201cI don\u2019t want to chat shit and be put on some watch list for saying I feel sorry for her,\u201d said one man in his 20s. \u201cWhat she did was wrong, but what they\u2019ve done is worse. They used all this power of the state against a teenage girl and her baby \u2013 and for what?\u201d In a Punjabi cafe in Whitechapel, a family of four were split in their views. Parents Sobia and Rizwan discussed whether Javid had been right to deny Begum the chance to return to the UK. \u201cI don\u2019t think he did it with good intention,\u201d said Sobia. \u201cI understand why he did it, because he wants to show he won\u2019t be soft on Muslims, but that was a baby\u2019s life. He punished an innocent baby.\u201d However, her husband said it was important to demonstrate that there are serious consequences to joining Isis. Did he agree with the decision to make her stateless? \u201cObviously not now, because her baby has died and we are supposed to be a civilised country. But what is the law around it? We should be using the proper laws. Why isn\u2019t the government going by their own rules?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
