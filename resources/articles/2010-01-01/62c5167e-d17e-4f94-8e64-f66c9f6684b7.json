The Serbia international is out of contract this summer and is seeking a lucrative move abroad, a situation that has alerted Birmingham City and Everton, too, to his availability. Alex McLeish reaffirmed his intention to sign a striker after Saturday's FA Cup fourth-round win at Goodison Park and, backed by the new owner Carson Yeung's promise of a \u00a340m January transfer kitty, may tempt Li\u00e8ge to cash in on the 28-year-old this month. Liverpool have attempted to ward off rival interest by offering Jovanovic a free transfer and personal terms of about \u00a310m over three years. Rafael Ben\u00edtez cannot compete with Birmingham in the transfer market this month but hopes his club's standing and the possibility of Champions League football next season may sway the former Shakhtar Donetsk and Lokomotiv Moscow forward towards Anfield. Jovanovic is eligible to sign a pre-contract agreement now and Anfield officials have also been in discussions with Bordeaux's Marouane Chamakh about a similar deal. The club are keen to remedy this season's failure to provide adequate striking cover for Fernando Torres. Reports at the weekend claimed Jovanovic, who has scored nine goals in 23 appearances for Serbia, is tempted by Liverpool but wary of becoming only a bit-part player under Ben\u00edtez. Liverpool's co-owner Tom Hicks, meanwhile, has agreed to sell his majority shareholding in the Texas Rangers baseball team but doubts remain over whether the American will reinvest the funds in the Merseyside club. Hicks is expected to receive close to $500m (\u00a3350m) for the franchise, which he has owned through Hicks Sports Group since 1998, from a consortium headed by the Pittsburgh-based attorney Chuck Greenberg and the legendary former Rangers pitcher Nolan Ryan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
