Suspicions have immediately turned to Pakistan-connected militant groups. Whatever the investigation uncovers \u2013 and it's still very early \u2013 one thing is clear: those groups still operate despite international pressure on Pakistan after the Mumbai attacks almost three years ago. The coordinated rush-hour explosions, which killed at least 21 and wounded more than 100, were smaller and less sophisticated than the meticulously planned strike on Mumbai in November 2008. During that three-day rampage by the Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group, ten gunmen targeted westerners and Jews, killed 166 people and left India and Pakistan on the brink of war. Testimony at a recent trial in Chicago revealed that officers of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate (ISI) helped Lashkar fund and plan that maritime assault on Mumbai. Commando-style raids are Lashkar's signature. In contrast, initial reports indicate that the latest attack involved bombs planted in strategic locations, a recurring tactic used by Indian affiliates of Lashkar in recent years. In 2006, bombs planted on suburban Mumbai trains killed more than 200 people. Authorities blamed the Students Islamic Movement of India which, along with another group, the Indian Mujahideen, has been trained and directed by Lashkar and elements of Pakistani intelligence, according to Indian and western counter-terrorism authorities. \"These groups still have the capacity to strike not just in Mumbai but around the country,\" said an Indian counter-terrorism official. The official and other experts said that while the investigation has just begun it is likely that Lashkar, a close ally of Pakistani security forces, played a direct or supporting role in the attack. Pakistan arrested Lashkar-e-Taiba's military chief and a few other suspects in the 2008 case, but their trial has stalled. Although the US and Indian governments have pressed Pakistan to dismantle Lashkar and other militant groups, most of the suspected Mumbai masterminds, including veteran Lashkar chiefs and a major in the ISI, remain at large. Pakistani officials refuse to pursue those suspects, who have been identified publicly, according to US counter-terrorism officials. The major in the ISI and three Lashkar chiefs have been indicted by US prosecutors for the deaths of six Americans in Mumbai. Western and Indian intelligence officials have warned in recent months that Lashkar remains intent on attacks in India and on western targets. \"That whole crew from the 2008 Mumbai attacks is still sitting there,\" said Praveen Swami, a journalist at The Hindu newspaper and national security analyst, in a telephone interview from Delhi. \"They haven't done anything big since then. This could be a testing of the waters. It's worth remembering that there were a number of smaller attacks in the buildup to Mumbai.\" Recent smaller bombings have included a blast at a bakery frequented by westerners, which killed 17 in the city of Pune last year. That attack probably had Lashkar links as well. David Coleman Headley, a confessed Lashkar and ISI operative who pleaded guilty to scouting targets for the 2008 Mumbai attack, also conducted reconnaissance in Pune, according to his testimony during the recent trial in Chicago. Headley did that scouting for Lashkar defectors who had joined al-Qaida, an evolving trend that has affected Indian Islamic militants as well and could be relevant to the latest attack, Swami said. Headley's revelations led to the unprecedented US indictment of the suspected ISI major, another flashpoint in the escalating conflict between the US and Pakistan since the slaying of Osama bin Laden in a Pakistani garrison town. During the past week, Pakistani leaders criticised the Obama administration for accusing the ISI of involvement in the murder of a Pakistani journalist and withholding $800m in military aid. The latest attack could also turn out to be part of that shadow conflict. The ISI uses militant groups as a weapon to strengthen its position in the dangerous triangle of Pakistani relations with the US and India, according to western and Indian counter-terrorism officials. Pakistan has denied any role in terrorism. Pakistani leaders issued public statements condemning the bombings in Mumbai. \u2022 Sebastian Rotella is a senior reporter at ProPublica"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
