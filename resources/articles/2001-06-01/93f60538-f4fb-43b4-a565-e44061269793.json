Campaigners immediately expressed disappointment that there was no guarantee that employees' requests for flexible hours would be granted. The taskforce has been asked to find a way of extending access to family-friendly working without placing \"onerous burdens\" on business. It will be headed by Sir George Bain, vice-chancellor of Queen's University in Belfast, and will include representatives from the TUC, the Equal Opportunities Commission and the CBI. Sir George, who reconciled employers to a minimum wage as chairman of the low pay commission, will also consider issues such as whether small businesses should be allowed an opt out and how long after a birth the right to ask for flexible working hours should last. However, campaigning organisations fear that without a statutory right, flexible working will continue to be seen as career-threatening. \"I am amazed that in the 21st century the government is portraying the right to ask as a major breakthrough,\" said Bill Morris, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union. \"What if the employer says 'No'?\" The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), the centre-left thinktank, said that without a statutory right, the most vulnerable would be excluded. \"Many workers are not aware of the rights they are already entitled to. Others are refused them by their employers and yet others are too scared to claim them,\" it said. The IPPR is calling for a new fair employment commission. Although only Germany and the Netherlands offer a statutory right to change working hours, many other countries, including the United States, allow parents to use their parental leave entitlement to work shorter hours. In some, such as Finland, it can be used up to the child's seventh birthday. The trade and industry secretary, Patricia Hewitt, said the government was doing all it could to make life easier for working parents through common sense policies. \"The taskforce confirms the government's commitment to listening to parents and bosses in order to achieve a workplace sympathetic to family and best for business.\" The National Council for One Parent Families welcomed the taskforce. Its director, Kate Green, said: \"The chance to work flexibly could ease the struggle for many working lone parents, so the taskforce is a welcome step forward.\" The British Chambers of Commerce complained that small companies were inadequately represented. \"It is going to be difficult for the two individual small firms on the taskforce to put forward their arguments against professional lobbyists representing employees,\" said its president, Anthony Goldstone. At present, flexible working - such as job sharing, working from home or working flexible hours - is much more widely available to women than to men. But with the cost of replacing staff running at \u00a31,000 to \u00a35,000 for each post, and with a third of women giving up work after they have a baby, there is a clear incentive to find ways of getting parents to return to work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
