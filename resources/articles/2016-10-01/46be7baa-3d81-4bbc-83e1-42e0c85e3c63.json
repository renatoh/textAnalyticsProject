The 18-year-olds have impressed for Liverpool\u2019s under-23s this season and are in contention for the squad for Tuesday\u2019s fourth-round tie at Anfield. Alexander-Arnold, Ejaria, Kevin Stewart, Marko Grujic and Danny Ings missed Sunday\u2019s 2-0 under-23s win over Everton to train at Melwood in preparation for Spurs\u2019 visit. Simon Mignolet, now officially Liverpool\u2019s second-choice goalkeeper according to his manager, is a confirmed starter in place of Loris Karius. Klopp credits the progress of several promising youngsters with the decision to retain a core group at Liverpool in the summer rather than send them out on loan. The Liverpool manager sanctioned a dozen loan moves, including for experienced players such as Jon Flanagan, Andre Wisdom and Lazar Markovic, but voiced doubts over the number of young players leaving Anfield temporarily as soon as he arrived 12 months ago. Keeping Alexander-Arnold, Ejaria and Ben Woodburn around the first-team squad has been better for their development, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good, really good. We spoke about changing the second team a little bit and a lot of players need to stay here, play together in a really good team, get results, score goals, win games and have the opportunity to train with us. The other way is to send them on loan at 17 or 18 years. We made this decision with a few players because of the squad. For example Ryan Kent [on loan at Barnsley], who was really close to the first team and maybe too good for the 23s. That was an individual decision for him and a few others. \u201cWe wanted to keep a lot of these players, play them together, and that was a real decision we made. It\u2019s good for their development and good for us that we can make the decisions about their futures at Liverpool. If we have to make a decision that a player is not good enough for Liverpool\u2019s first team then they need to be good enough for another Premier League club or, the minimum, a Championship club. We have to give them the opportunity and that is what we are doing. They can still stay a little longer in their situation and be patient, they can use the time in the corner with not the biggest public watching them, not lots of people asking about you and watching each step. Hopefully we can bring through a few of them in the red shirt of Liverpool at Anfield in the first team. That is the dream of all of us.\u201d Klopp said it is premature to judge players at 18 as \u201cthere is no challenge or tournament or competition for the younger ones\u201d in English football. Liverpool will give young talent more time to make the grade and, having trusted academy players in cup competitions last season, it has shown there is a pathway at Anfield. \u201cIt would be cool if we had 10 players from the academy,\u201d he said. \u201cI would love to be part of the press conference where I say: \u2018No signings this year.\u2019\u201d Ings, fully recovered from a cruciate ligament injury, could also play against Spurs having been in prolific form for the under-23s. Klopp said: \u201cIf I was a little less sensitive I could say that is his job but I am sensitive and I know it is not easy for him. With his attitude everything will be good in the end. The situation is not easy. We have Roberto Firmino, Daniel Sturridge and Divock Origi so there is not a lot of space for the few minutes you could give.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
