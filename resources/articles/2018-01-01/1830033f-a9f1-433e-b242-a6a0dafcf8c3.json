Media and political attention on African youth crime in Melbourne has been prompted by a series of recent high-profile incidents, particularly in the city\u2019s western suburbs. That includes an alleged assault of a police officer, a brawl, and property damage at a community centre and Airbnb properties. But Victoria police have argued for a level-headed response, describing the youths as \u201cthugs\u201d who are not part of organised gangs, and saying there had been no increase in offending. Police deputy commissioner Andrew Crisp last week urged the media not to refer to youth thugs as \u201cgangs\u201d, saying it only served to stroke the egos of those involved. He said his force was \u201cwell and truly on top of\u201d youth crime in Victoria. But on Tuesday the state\u2019s shadow attorney general, John Pesutto, said he respectfully disagreed. \u201cIn Melbourne, particularly in recent weeks, there has just been a spate of really brazen and in some cases quite horrific crimes committed by gangs or gang network and related violence,\u201d Pesutto told the ABC. \u201cSo there is a real crisis. Daniel Andrews, premier, and his ministers are acting as though there\u2019s nothing to worry about, and that\u2019s really infuriating communities around Melbourne. Pesutto said \u201cpretending there was no problem\u201d was not going to help, and light sentences were sending the wrong signal to offenders. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen though, in recent times, is we have seen gangs and networks of violence where there has been an overrepresentation of Sudanese and South Sudanese,\u201d he told the ABC. \u201cNow, we all want to be very careful here and we know how important it is to engage. But it is also important to not pretend there is nothing to see here.\u201d Data from Victoria\u2019s Crime Statistics Agency shows youth crime has fallen considerably as a proportion of total crime in the past 10 years. People under 25 were responsible for 40% of all incidents in 2015-16, compared with 50% in 2015-2016. The data shows people born in Sudan are a tiny minority in Victorian crime statistics, though overrepresented compared with their share of the total population. The total number of offences they committed are a fraction of those committed by Australians or New Zealanders. Between January 2014 and December 2016, people born in Sudan were responsible for 666 of the 42,502 offences in Victoria, or about 1.56%. The state opposition has proposed a hardline, incarceration-focused response, including presumptions against bail, mandatory sentencing for those convicted of repeat serious offences, and a new prison for juveniles. Police minister Lisa Neville on Tuesday said there was a \u201csmall, but core group\u201d of \u201ccriminal thugs, or street gangs\u201d who were causing significant harm. \u201cThis is a small but core group, the vast majority of the African community are law abiding citizens, but this core group of African youths are causing huge fear,\u201d Neville said. \u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate, it\u2019s unacceptable, and it will not be tolerated.\u201d She hit back at claims the government was not doing enough to combat youth crime. Neville said police had been given more frontline resources, and the government had introduced youth control orders and made changes to parole laws to place stricter controls on young offenders after their release from detention. She denied there was any link between dealing with the problem and Labor\u2019s prospects at the next state election. \u201cMy focus has always just been on improving the community safety, reducing crime and harm in our community, it\u2019s not about elections and the next election, I can tell you that,\u201d she said. The acting chief police commissioner, Shane Patton, said he did not view the recent incidents as an \u201cescalation, if you like, of offending\u201d. But he said police recognised African youths were over-represented in serious and violent offending, and public disorder. He said it was a misconception that police had not acknowledged the problem. Patton said police would not shy away from describing groups of offenders as \u201cgangs\u201d, but the individuals involved were not what police would traditionally consider organised crime gangs. \u201cThey\u2019re behaving like street gangs, so let\u2019s call them that, that\u2019s what they are, they\u2019re behaving like street gangs. We acknowledge that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to stress though, we don\u2019t want to elevate these young thugs, these young criminals to any status or give them any type of credibility that they don\u2019t already have.\u201d Police say the root cause of criminality among African communities is complex, and involves disadvantage, unemployment and disengagement from society. South Sudanese and Somali community leaders told Fairfax Media this week that the crimes involved a small core of young men who were not getting proper support when released from detention. On Monday the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and cabinet minister Greg Hunt, who is from Victoria, fired a broadside at the Andrews government over the issue. Turnbull, in his first press conference of 2018, said the federal government was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the \u201cgrowing gang violence and lawlessness in Victoria\u201d. \u201cThis is a failure of the Andrews government,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cVictoria police is a huge organisation \u2013 much larger than the federal police. It\u2019s got the capacity to do the job. \u201cBut what is lacking is the political leadership and the determination on the part of Premier Andrews to make sure the great policemen and women of Victoria have the leadership, the direction, and the confidence of the government to get on with the job.\u201d Turnbull\u2019s intervention provoked an angry response from the Victorian government. The state\u2019s attorney general, Martin Pakula, said the comments were an \u201cembarrassing low from a pathetic, do nothing PM\u201d. \u201cHis interventions may be worth more if his own government wasn\u2019t so indolent and chaotic. A joke,\u201d Pakula tweeted. Last year, the South Sudanese Community Association acknowledged and expressed serious concern that \u201ca number of young people of South Sudanese origin have engaged in serious criminal activities\u201d. But it warned media coverage of the crimes was fuelling \u201cnegative public perceptions of Australian South Sudanese people\u201d. \u201cThe community is concerned that the level of negative media attention it is receiving is increasing the incidence of racial discrimination and stereotyping for the community in general, especially people being wrongly associated to the so-called \u2018Apex\u2019 gang,\u201d the association said in a submission to an inquiry into migrant resettlement outcomes. \u201cThe brunt of the negative attention is falling on innocent community members and is a major concern.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
