Come the end of the Test, the BBC will offer downloads from its Radio 4 Test Match Special coverage, which has been simulcast on digital station 5 Live Sports Extra, in combination with key moments from 5 Live's coverage. The downloads will be available from 5 Live's website and can be stored and played back on mp3 players, computers and mobile phones so fans will be able to listen to them wherever they are. Should, whisper it, England win, there could be huge demand for the coverage, which could be stored as a souvenir of the occasion. If the home team fails in its bid to bring the Ashes back to England, there could be a lot of Australians logging on for the downloads. The BBC averaged around 100,000 download requests a week throughout July, with around 30,000 listeners requesting Melvyn Bragg's weekly philosophy and ideas discussion show, In Our Time, which was more popular than Chris Moyles' Radio 1 show and Radio 4's Today. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
