Shares in the group, which runs gas and electricity distribution and transmission systems, jumped 27p to 726p in early trading this morning as it also announced a bigger-than-expected increase in profits. Its pre-tax total for the first half rose by 12% to \u00a3872m, comfortably ahead of analysts' forecasts. Earnings per share jumped by 21% to 21.7p. Chairman Sir John Parker said the strong performance had been driven by the group's UK transmission and US electricity and gas distribution businesses. He is confident of delivering \"continued good results and sustained growth\". Revenues for the six months to the end of September rose by \u00a3300,000 to \u00a34.2bn. The group's near $12bn (\u00a36.36bn) acquisition of KeySpan Corp, announced in February, has virtually doubled the size of its business in the US, where it is now the third-largest supplier of gas and electricity. Reflecting the group's continued focus on UK and US electricity and gas markets, it plans to demerge its Wireless infrastructure business and also to sell Basslink, its electricity interconnector in Australia. In the UK electricity and gas market it sees \"significant opportunities\" for growth. \"The decline of North Sea gas production, the UK government's renewable energy policy and the need for asset replacement are driving investment in this area,\" the group said. It plans to a significant increase in investment in this area, with spending of \u00a39bn budgeted in the five years to March 2011. The group also sees \"significant growth potential\" in the US electricity and gas market following the KeySpan deal. \u00b7 Email business.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
