The Public Law Project (PLP), which obtained the figures, said the findings raised \u201ca number of red flags\u201d for EU citizens \u201cseeking to make the UK their home\u201d. The PLP discovered via a series of freedom of information requests that 89.5% of initial EU settlement scheme (EUSS) decisions subject to an \u201cadministrative review\u201d by an EU citizen unhappy with their conclusions were overturned. In just under 60% of total reviews, the Home Office refunded the \u00a380 administration fee. The FoI shows that 451 administrative reviews had been requested up to 12 September this year, less than six months after the scheme was launched. Of the total 325 administrative reviews that had been decided by that date, 291 resulted in a decision of \u201cpre-settled status\u201d being overturned and \u201csettled status\u201d granted. The PLP says this success rate is \u201cdrastically higher\u201d than other Home Office administrative reviews, which were recorded in 2016/2017 as 3.4%. Most, but not all, of the 3.4 million EU citizens who wish to remain in the UK after Brexit must apply to the scheme. Those who have been in the country for fewer than five years can get pre-settled status allowing them to remain lawfully in the country. Under the system, \u201cadministrative reviews\u201d may be requested if a decision grants pre-settled status but an applicant believes they qualify for settled status. Some decisions have been overturned because of mistakes made by caseworkers, although the Home Office says the majority are made because an applicant has provided new information. The PLP says the data could show a successful process in operation, demonstrating the Home Office checks are working. Bu it \u201ccould also indicate that the automated data checks and initial decision-makers are getting things wrong more frequently,\u201d said PLP research director Joe Tomlinson and PLP researcher Alice Welsh in a blog post on the matter. It is also a concern because \u201ca tribunal appeal right for EUSS decisions is still yet to be legislated for and judicial review is expensive, inaccessible, and limited to narrow legality claims, so administrative review is the primary mode of redress\u201d available for applicants to the scheme, they added. The Home Office said the overall number of administrative reviews \u201cis very low compared to the 2.4m applications and 1.9m granted status by the end of October 2019\u201d. It also cautioned against concluding the high number of successes were because of mistakes by officials. It said the \u201cmajority of overturned decisions are not caseworker error but where an applicant provides new information\u201d. However the PLP said that whatever the reason, the Home Office needs to get every decision right and may have to improve its communications to ensure EU citizens apply with correct information. Tomlinson and other lawyers are warning EU citizens not to accept pre-settled status if they feel they are entitled to settled status and to challenge Home Office decisions. \u201cThis distinction could have a big impact on their rights to access services in the UK such as healthcare, housing and benefits,\u201d says Tomlinson. Last month it emerged that the proportion of EU citizens being granted \u201cpre-settled status\u201d in the UK has continued to rise. Tomlinson called on the Home Office to provide greater detail about the data it provides to the public in order to help ensure independent observers are satisfied the system is not discriminatory or faulty. \u201cThe lack of available data means it is impossible for anyone outside of the Home Office to trouble shoot. Is the system working well or not? We just don\u2019t know,\u201d said Tomlinson."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
