It was a great blueprint, but it was even more cerebral and talky. He was keen to capture something very true, so wanted the two leads to be writers on the film as well \u2013 and he auditioned us about what we wanted to say. I talked about some stuff that ended up in the film, about God existing in the space between people. So Richard, Ethan and I produced the script together, though Ethan and I weren\u2019t credited for Before Sunrise. The process was totally collaborative: all three of us had to agree on ideas for scenes. That\u2019s how we did Before Sunset and Before Midnight, too. If one of us hated something, it wouldn\u2019t make the film. From the start, those guys wanted the balance of a proper female voice. The writing was still going on during the shoot in Vienna; for example, that\u2019s when I wrote the scene in which my character C\u00e9line makes a mock phone call to a friend and announces she\u2019s in love with Jesse. Remembering that much dialogue was torture \u2013 and it was even worse with the longer takes on Before Sunset, which I had suggested doing in real time. I had been going through a bit of a difficult time in the early 00s, struggling to make films as a director and I\u2019d had some health issues. But it wasn\u2019t directly autobiographical: like the director Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski once told me, you take a seed of truth and make it a tree. I had thought of the ending, where I imitate Nina Simone and tell Jesse he\u2019s going to miss his plane, for another film I\u2019d written. I performed it for Richard and he loved it. I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to give it away, but I thought: this series is more important than some film of mine I might never do. These films speak to everyone, from adolescence to the end of life; they\u2019re not just about generation X. Really young people now even like Before Sunrise because they see their parents in Jesse and C\u00e9line. You see Ethan and I getting older as the series progresses. The films are really a study of time. Ethan Hawke, actor and writer I\u2019d been going through a really hard time with my divorce, so that summer in Paris shooting Before Sunset was extremely healing, reconnecting with Richard and Julie. She and I had done a little cameo as Jesse and C\u00e9line in Richard\u2019s 2001 animated feature Waking Life, and we started daydreaming about how we could make another movie together. A little later, Richard turned up to a book signing I was doing in Austin and had a flash of an idea: what if Jesse had written a book about C\u00e9line, and she turned up to the signing? There\u2019s definitely something autobiographical in that opening exchange at the bookshop about using your own life to create art \u2013 and what the value of that is. You never really find the answers, but there\u2019s a healthy healing process that comes from asking certain questions, and I hope the film asks them of me. The third film, Before Midnight, was the hardest to make because the first two are about romantic projection. I felt it was important to do a corresponding film that was grounded in reality and the nature of love on a day-to-day basis. Could we make a film about a couple who\u2019ve been together for years and raised kids, but still have it be romantic, without telling one lie? We weren\u2019t sure the audience would like it \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t want to see a sequel to Titanic with Jack and Rose fighting. The structure was very challenging, too. We wanted to do a Bergman, like Scenes from a Marriage, with a sequence that starts off as a love scene, but ends in them possibly breaking up. So writing that climactic marital row scene was one of the most difficult things I\u2019ve ever done; 30 pages, without being boring, in one single room is tough. But it works as a complete circle: the way Before Sunrise starts is this couple in their 40s fighting on the train. We realised as we filmed it: \u201cWow, we\u2019ve become that couple.\u201d So there\u2019s something about the trilogy that feels finished to me. Every time we make one of them, the stakes get higher. We wouldn\u2019t want to pour any water in our beer. Which isn\u2019t to say we couldn\u2019t revisit Jesse and C\u00e9line; we muse on it sometimes. A fourth film would have to work in some way that broke the rhythm of this cycle, maybe to address mortality. But these three films have been a blessing in my life. \u2022 The Before Trilogy is out now on Criterion Collection Blu-ray."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
