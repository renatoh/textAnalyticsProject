On inset day, before the children came back, I was merrily boasting about my seeming inability to catch germs. I hadn't suffered a cold in five years and, apparently, the other new teacher and I had been the only teachers last year not to have taken a day off. I was rudely reminded that the only bugs I caught last year were the least desirable barnet variety - something I have yet to live down. Head bugs aside, a year with neither colds nor tummy bugs is a rare feat for an NQT. There is a natural tendency for new teachers to fall victim to the 30 different germ medleys brought daily into the classroom. One year on, and I've had no such beginner's luck. Within 24 hours of my bragging, I had headaches, a temperature and footballs inside my throat. It was the day my new class arrived. They cannot have been thrilled at the prospect of a quiet, sweaty and cross-eyed new teacher. After a weekend in bed, I've bounced back to start my new term again. It's all go at school, with a new deputy head and two new NQTs. I was expecting to feel a bit old hat. Life is likely to be a bit easier this year since I'm teaching the same year group again, without the hassle of a split year and Sats. My new class are wonderful - fun and hardworking - but teachers say that you never forget your first class. It is weird seeing them running around the playground several centimetres taller already. The strange thing about teaching is that every year is brand new. Even with the same year group, the experience will be totally different. In office jobs, years go by in a blur of random holidays, ideally with your position and salary changing for the better. In teaching, every September is a fresh beginning, where you go back to start with even more butterflies than you had as a child starting a new year. Your job spec might also change - I've become PE coordinator, to the hilarity of some friends and colleagues. It is amazing how regularly this job goes to second-year teachers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
