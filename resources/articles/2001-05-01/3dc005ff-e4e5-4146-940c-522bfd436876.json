The NAPF's institutional investment members control 20% of the stock market and are being sent the first guidelines because of the recent requirement on pension fund trustees to disclose their approach to so-called Socially Responsible Investment (SRI). In many instances, pension fund trustees pass this responsibility on to their institutional investment management group - the NAPF's members. The extent to which City investment firms are geared up to deal with SRI is not clear, however. John Rogers, head of the NAPF's voting issue service said the new policy - \"engaging for success\" - was designed to allow shareholders to invest in companies which they might otherwise have been forced to \"screen out\". Instead of avoiding investments in potentially troublesome companies, such as tobacco groups, the idea is that leading shareholders agitate for change. \"If you screen out investment you don't have a say,\" Mr Rogers said. He said letters from investment managers to offending companies may be more effective than avoiding investment altogether - or even having the opportunity to vote on such issues at annual general meetings. The guidelines come as the FTSE prepares to introduce a separate index designed to encourage socially responsible investment. To be known as FTSE4Good, the index based on the alternative - and until now the more traditional approach - which is to screen out companies not deemed socially responsible. The NAPF has teamed up with the Institute of Business Ethics which, from July, intends to certify companies on their ethical stance. It will provide a GoodCorporation kitemark intended to provide a benchmark against which investors can judge their record. Since last year, the government has demanded pension fund trustees disclose the \"extent to which social, environmental and ethical considerations are taken into account in the selection, retention and realisation of investments\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
