I don\u2019t mean it\u2019s an excuse or an alibi and things can only get better. Not in that sense. I mean: \u2018let\u2019s show them that they are all wrong\u2019. We have an even bigger motivation now.\u201d The West Brom manager also invoked examples that give his promoted team heart. \u201cWe want to compete as a very confident team that is going to stay in the league for a long time. I bet that when you talked to Sheffield United before the start of last season, they said their first objective was to stay up. But when they got momentum, they didn\u2019t say \u2018no, no, we\u2019re happy now\u2019. \u201cYou have to be humble, positive and well balanced. We only think positive things. We don\u2019t think about Norwich, we think about Sheffield United and also Aston Villa, who were fighting until the last day of the season. \u201cThere are many positive examples in every league every year. We want to be like them. For that you have to have the right quality, the right mentality and, most of all, you have to believe. Because if you don\u2019t believe, then what is the point? We believe.\u201d Maybe they are kidding themselves out of necessity but at least they are not saying the season is going to be easy and they know there is a key part of Bilic\u2019s formula \u2013 the bit about \u201cthe right quality\u201d \u2013 that must be addressed. After finishing second in the Championship despite a jittery run-in, West Brom had to do two things to prepare for their return to the top-flight: make permanent signings of the loanees who did well last season, and recruit enough higher-grade players to thrive in the Premier League. They have managed to do the first part \u2013 securing the continued services of Callum Robinson, Matheus Pereira and, most preciously of all, Grady Diangama, and they are working to bring Filip Krovinovic back from Benfica. The second part is proving more difficult, though as Bilic spoke on Friday, the former Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic was undergoing a medical at the club with a view to joining from Zenit St Petersburg, where he has been captain for the last three seasons. He will not be available in time for Sunday\u2019s season opener at home to Leicester, but Bilic is convinced the player will prove a valuable addition to his lineup and, at 36, can still be a force in the Premier League. \u201cHis career has been magnificent so everyone is delighted,\u201d Bilic said. \u201cI know how he plays. We\u2019re not talking about someone who we\u2019ve had to do homework on from his time at Chelsea \u2013 that was ages ago. Ivanovic played really, really good at Zenit. We\u2019re getting him for his experience, for his quality and the influence he\u2019ll have on the pitch and in the dressing room. Not only centre backs, not only defenders, will have the opportunity to learn from him. He ticked all the boxes for us.\u201d West Brom continue to try to strengthen their attacking options, and success could depend on their ability to strike gold with modest resources. Chelsea\u2019s 20-year-old forward Conor Gallagher and the Huddersfield striker Karlan Grant are among the targets being pursued. \u201cWe are doing everything to be creative but it\u2019s not easy to be creative without the proper funds for the players we are talking about and that we want to get. We want players who will improve us straight away and those players cost money. But we are trying, we are close to doing a couple more deals and we are doing everything to be in a better position.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
