But for lovers of water plants, in the summer of 2007 a Thai farmer would overturn almost 100 years of entrenched dogma with a creation that many thought impossible: a hardy blue waterlily. With their flawless translucent petals, waterlilies are among the most beautiful of all garden plants. Yet their quirky genetics mean that, unlike most garden favourites, this genus eluded the endeavours of plant breeders until just over a century ago. Right up to the late 1800s the only waterlily available to European gardeners was the white native form. Then a French horticultural genius called Joseph Bory Latour-Marliac cracked a hybridising technique whose results dramatically expanded the options available by mixing in the genes of waterlily species from North America. Pinks, yellows, oranges and reds were the result. It was his waterlilies that inspired Monet, resulting in an explosion in the plant\u2019s popularity. However, Latour-Marliac\u2019s lifelong dream of breeding tropical waterlily species into hardy forms remained an elusive goal. As he famously took his breeding secrets with him to his death in 1911, his vision remained confined to a historical footnote. Over the course of the next century it was conventionally thought that a difference in chromosome number meant that crossing tropical and hardy waterlilies was a genetic impossibility. So when, in 2007, Pairat Songpanich reported he had produced a perfect lavender bloom on frost-hardy plants, it was greeted by many with sheer disbelief. Genetic tests, however, confirmed \u2018Siam Blue Hardy\u2019 to be the first ever proven intersubgeneric (ISG) hybrid. This first cross unleashed all manner of wonderful genetic combinations, making Thailand the world centre of waterlily breeding. Tragically, however, just four years later, a huge flood hit the region. When the waters retreated, all the \u2018Siam Blue Hardy\u2019 plants had been lost. Fortunately, for gardeners in cooler latitudes, many other hardy ISG hybrids did survive and these are now becoming increasingly available in the trade. From \u2018Siam Purple 1\u2019 (another one of Pairat Songpanich\u2019s early creations), whose white petals are blushed with purple at the tips, contrasting beautifully with its sulphur yellow centres, to the semi-double, deep lilac-blushed \u2018Queen Sirikit\u2019, this new generation of Thai cultivars is changing everything. Capturing the imaginations of collectors, some of the brand new varieties can sell for eye-watering prices. However, the costs are falling rapidly, which means soon anyone should be able to enjoy these wonders. Either way, growing one of these miracles of human ingenuity is less than the price of going to see a football match and to me, as a geeky gardener, there is no doubt in my mind which would bring me more joy.
