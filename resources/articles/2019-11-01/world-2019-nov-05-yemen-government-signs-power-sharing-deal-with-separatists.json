The deal aims to create a new, cohesive government capable of challenging the Iranian-backed Houthi forces that control the capital, Sana\u2019a, and the north. The clashes between separatists and government forces \u2013 who for years fought on the same side against the Houthis \u2013 had raised fears that the country could break apart entirely. It also exposed a rift between normal Gulf allies, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. In August, the separatists took control of Aden, which has served as the beleaguered government\u2019s base since it was ousted from Sana\u2019a by Houthi rebels in 2014. The agreement, formally sealed at a signing ceremonyin Riyadh on Tuesday, is short on specifics but is expected to share out ministries equally between the UN-backed government led by Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi and the backers of the president of the Southern Transitional Council, Aidarus al-Zoubaidi. Speaking at the signing ceremony in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman described the deal as \u201ca joyful day in Saudi as the two sides come together\u201d. Donald Trump, who rarely comments on the civil war in Yemen, hailed the agreement as \u201ca very good start\u201d, adding \u201cplease all work hard to get a final deal\u201d. Elements of the deal include the return of the UN-backed government to Aden within seven days to reactivate state institutions. The separatists also agreed to disband their militias, which would be integrated into Hadi\u2019s forces within three months. The STC will have a right to be represented fully in any talks on the future of Yemen overseen by the UN special envoy, Martin Griffiths. Griffiths said the agreement was \u201can important step for our collective efforts to advance a peaceful settlement to the conflict in Yemen. Listening to southern stakeholders is important to the political efforts to achieve peace in the country.\u201d Griffiths had been anxious to avoid excluding the southern forces, since any agreement reached without their inclusion was likely to fall apart. But observers will be anxious to see if the alliance, assuming it holds, simply leads to a reinvigorated militarily assault on Houthi positions, or instead leads to substantive talks on Yemen\u2019s future. In a sign of the tensions over the agreement, an assassination attempt was made last week on Yemen\u2019s ministers of interior and transport in the southern province of Shabwah, just hours after an initial deal between the two sides was agreed. In recent weeks, Saudi Arabia has increased its military presence in southern Yemen, airlifting in additional troops, armoured vehicles, tanks and other military equipment. And since July, the UAE has been pulling troops out of Yemen, leaving the coalition with a weakened ground presence and fewer tactical options."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
