His most ardent fans willingly admit that some of his middle works were a touch inclined to pointless scatology and druggie meanderings. But what you get here, fans will be delighted to learn, is a triumph. A thoughtful, rather brave take on paedophile rings and the minds, fast and slow, behind them. It could have touched on creepy; it could have slipped into prurient. Instead, it is incredibly sure-footed. Crime is not destined to become a cult book. It's better than that. Ray Lennox, who slips throughout the book from antihero to, actually, hero, is the Edinburgh cop who's gone to Florida with his fiancee to (she thinks) plan their wedding and (he knows) try to come to terms with his failure to catch a child rapist and killer: a nonce, a beast, a stoat. At the start, for the reader, there's a strange uncertainty over what or who we're reading: there are echoes of Rebus, of Christopher Brookmyre, even, because of the setting, of Carl Hiaasen. But when Lennox's devils make him fall out with perfect fiancee Tina, and he ends up back on the booze, back on the coke, back in a club so seedy you're tempted to stop reading and actually check the soles of your own shoes for gum and chemicals, you know you are firmly in Welsh territory. Slowly, Lennox begins to redeem himself. He takes on the mantle of protector, in this case of a rangy, bony, bonny, dangerously sexy Miami teenage girl, whose junkie mother's instinctive protection is being casually subverted by a small organised team of paedophile misfits, including a local policeman. Lennox wins, in the end. But this precis performs a fabulous disservice. Yes, that's the plot: a crime uncovered, and put right. What this novel is essentially about, however, is an incident in Ray Lennox's early teens: a casually vicious little piece of noncing in the black undergrowth of a green Edinburgh riverbank. And, even more so, about the differing ways he and his fellow victim have dealt with it down the years. It's about letting go and not letting them win, about being, in the end, a bigger person. On the way, however, you get much laughter and anger. You get Ray's odious expat chum Ginger, as unreconstructed a Scottish cop as they come. You get canny insights into the way the British police and media mesh so perfectly to get the worst result possible. You get fiancee Tina morphing back into a human being rather than a wedding mannequin (and a marvellous running gag involving her Perfect Bride magazine, pretty much all Ray leaves the hotel with after the break-up, its glossy idyll of a cover slowly getting warped with salt, blood and various unmentionables during the journey). Welsh is a brave writer, which means he tries everything, and sometimes his editors let him get away with one metaphor too many. But this is still a great, redemptive book. It leaves you wanting more, much more. It leaves you wondering how many other writers could intertwine, in the closing chapters, a thoughtful dissection of the organic intelligence of paedophilia rings with an exposition of the thoughts of chairman Wallace Mercer in the urinals of Dundee's Dens Park on the infamous 1986 day when Hearts threw away cup victory. What am I saying, many other writers? There's only one and you should be reading him again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
