In each case, someone totally uninterested in football gets involved with the cops while everyone else's attention is concentrated on the championship match. An Englishwoman in Moscow and a Hungarian pilgrim in Santiago are robbed, while a German student in Istabul and a pair of itinerant French clowns in Berlin fake robberies to get insurance money. It's well observed, beautifully photographed and all rather predictable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
