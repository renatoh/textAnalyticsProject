According to a popular meme going around at the moment, intentions matter more than actions. \u201cYour grandparents were called to war,\u201d it says. \u201cYou\u2019re being called to sit on the couch.\u201d In a way, sitting around and doing nothing is a new type of heroism, because going out and living life as normal makes you a passive bystander to a global threat. But in ordinary times, the difference between a hero and a bystander is far more clear-cut. What makes some of us the former, and some of us the latter? As she was boarding the tube in London on an otherwise ordinary Friday morning last November, Asma Shuweikh felt a man rush past her. He made a beeline for an orthodox Jewish family sitting by the doors\u2013 a father and two sons in kippah. Brandishing a bible, the man began to hurl antisemitic abuse at the family; as Shuweikh stood in shocked silence, she noticed he had highlighted passages in his book. When the man turned his attention to the children, she decided she could not remain silent any longer: it was time to speak up. In a video that subsequently went viral on social media, the 36-year-old can be seen calmly telling the aggressor: \u201cCome on, man, there\u2019s children here\u2026 You\u2019re on public transport.\u201d What made Shuweikh speak out and put herself in the firing line? The abuser later began berating her for being a Muslim woman wearing trousers. She says that faith and motherhood helped inform her actions. \u201cWhen I see something wrong,\u201d she says, \u201cI have to say it.\u201d According to Catherine A Sanderson, a psychology professor at Amherst College in Massachusetts and the author of The Bystander Effect, myriad complex factors make some of us bystanders and some of us heroes. These range from our self-identity to the pressure of social norms. Sanderson says she was inspired to write the book by both \u201cpersonal and global\u201d events: Harvey Weinstein\u2019s sex offences, the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal, and the fact that a student at her son\u2019s college died just two weeks into his very first semester. The student had been drinking heavily and had fallen and hit his head. Although fellow students watched over him, they didn\u2019t call emergency services for nearly 20 hours. By which time it was too late to save him. Her book answers the question at the heart of this incident: why? You may already know about the \u201cbystander effect\u201d. For more than 50 years, newspaper articles and textbooks have recounted the story of Kitty Genovese \u2013 a young woman who was murdered outside her apartment in New York in 1964. It was claimed almost 40 people heard or saw Genovese\u2019s murder, yet none of them spoke out. The term bystander effect was coined to explain the fact that individuals are less likely to help people in need when other people are present. The Genovese story is largely apocryphal \u2013 later research revealed that no witnesses actually saw the attack in its entirety and two people did in fact call the police. Yet this doesn\u2019t mean the bystander effect isn\u2019t without some truth. In her book, Sanderson shares a number of scientific and real-life case studies that prove the presence of others makes it more difficult for us to speak out. In one New York University study carried out shortly after the Genovese case, 85% of participants sought help for a man who was slurring his words when they believed only they could hear him. When they thought others could hear him, too, only 31% went to get help. Sanderson isn\u2019t interested in easy explanations about fearless heroes and callous bystanders. \u201cThe question of why some people act badly and others don\u2019t is not really about good and bad,\u201d she says. She notes that many of the participants in the New York study were physically distressed and argues they didn\u2019t choose not to act but were rather paralysed by a \u201cstate of indecision\u201d. Throughout her book, Sanderson references a number of neurological studies that explain our inaction. She shows that working with others reduces our feeling of control and that as the number of observers to an incident increases, the parts of our brains that prepare us to take action actually become less active. \u201cMany of the processes that drive inaction occur not through a careful deliberative process, but at an automatic level in the brain.\u201d Sanderson is a psychologist not a neuroscientist, so I ask why she chose to focus so much on brain activity in the book. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for people to understand that what they\u2019re doing is natural and probably even adaptive from an evolutionary point,\u201d she says. \u201cBut neuroscience lets us be aware of our pre-existing unconscious biases. It gives us the power to say: \u2018This is normal and it\u2019s natural, but I still have some agency and I can act.\u2019\u201d The third section of Sanderson\u2019s book is more of a guide to how we can all change our behaviour to ensure we speak out, whether that be about discrimination on public transport, workplace fraud, sexual harassment or school bullies. Sanderson\u2019s research shows many of us often believe we would act in certain scenarios. Who among us hasn\u2019t had a casual fantasy about heroically saving the day by whistleblowing at work, saving an infant and/or granny from traffic, or karate chopping a pervert in the park? But in that fantasy, we\u2019re thinking about ourselves alone. In the real world, Sanderson says, we are often bystanders as part of a group and because of that we experience \u201cdeindividuation\u201d. Can we be \u201cre-individualised\u201d to ensure that we act as we hope we might? A study Sanderson references seems to suggest we can. In 2012, academics from Harvard asked people to take a maths test and offered them $1 for every correct answer. The twist? Participants scored themselves. The study\u2019s participants were divided into groups that included those who signed an honesty declaration at the end of the test after they\u2019d written down their score; and those who signed a declaration at the top of the sheet before scoring themselves. In the end, 79% of people who signed their name at the bottom of the page cheated by inflating their score, compared to only 37% of those who signed their name before scoring themselves. \u201cWhen we are reminded of who we are \u2013 which signing our name surely does \u2013 we are also reminded of our intentions to be a good person who does the right thing,\u201d Sanderson writes. By remarkable coincidence, Darryn Frost was reminded of who he was shortly before he ran at a terrorist with a narwhal tusk during the London Bridge attack of November 2019. \u201cI was at a conference directly before the attack and an American woman was talking about where we learn our behaviours,\u201d he explains. \u201cShe started our session asking us for three positive and negative traits about ourselves.\u201d After this, Frost says, she prompted the audience to think about their earliest memory where they learned these traits. \u201cIt was literally just after that that everything kicked off, so my emotions at the time were really raw and on the surface.\u201d In general, Frost\u2019s experiences tally with Sanderson\u2019s optimism that we can overcome our inaction. Frost says he taught himself to speak out and conquer fear \u2013 he assists those in need and confronts people who are disrespectful to others when he is out in public. \u201cIt mostly comes from my schooling\u2026 My school motto was: \u2018For the brave, nothing is too difficult\u2019. They teach you to be a good citizen and to look out for your fellow man.\u201d Of his response to the attack, he says: \u201cIt did feel instinctive to an extent, but that instinct has been taught and nurtured and built over years.\u201d One thing Sanderson says we all must nurture, and build in ourselves is the ability to overcome social awkwardness. Time and time again, she notes how social pressures facilitate inaction. Put simply: if we are around others, we base how we act on how they\u2019re acting. Many of us might avoid speaking out for fear that we\u2019ve misjudged a situation \u2013 after all, if it really was that bad, wouldn\u2019t others be speaking up, too? Psychologists call these worries \u201cevaluation apprehension\u201d. We\u2019re concerned we\u2019ll look stupid or sensitive or strange if we speak out. Sanderson notes that people find it easier to intervene if they are less concerned about fitting in, yet also notes those who are worried about fitting in feel social ostracisation more strongly. The neuroscience shows that for these people, rejection feels like physical pain \u2013 \u201cas if you\u2019ve twisted your ankle or burned yourself with coffee\u201d. Sanderson also argues it\u2019s more difficult to act when situations are ambiguous and less dramatic, noting that empirical evidence shows that in obvious emergencies such as terror attacks, people are just as likely to help whether alone or in a crowd. While Shuweikh had little doubt what was happening when she saw that man brandishing a highlighted bible, I spoke to someone who failed to act when they saw harassment on another train. Carla, 30, says she was travelling in west London when she heard some Muslim teenagers chatting. Suddenly, a trans woman stood up and shouted at the teens. Carla realised later that they had insulted the woman in a language they both spoke, but which Carla couldn\u2019t understand. \u201cIt took a long time to even realise that something bad had happened, so I only started weighing up whether to say something when the trans woman began telling the carriage what had happened,\u201d Carla explains. She says she felt stressed, ashamed and conflicted as she weighed up what to do \u2013 she felt as though her face went red. \u201cI felt awful for this woman, because I know how much discrimination trans people face\u2026 but I was afraid, I didn\u2019t want to be seen shouting at a group of young, visibly Muslim people in case it appeared racist.\u201d Carla also says it was late and she was in a part of town she didn\u2019t know, which fed her inhibitions. In the end, she didn\u2019t speak out except to shout \u201cgood for you!\u201d to the woman as she stood up for herself. Describing the story now, Carla apologises for being \u201ccowardly\u201d. Sanderson emphasises that Carla isn\u2019t cowardly \u2013 the difference between a hero and a bystander is heavily situational. In another incident, Carla was the only person to call an ambulance when someone was run over by a bus, while Frost says he was uncomfortable at being labelled a \u201chero\u201d after the London Bridge attack. He says he is \u201chaunted\u201d by the times in his adult life when he didn\u2019t speak out or take action. \u201cPeople seem to glorify my actions and yes I\u2019m proud of them, but there\u2019s a lot of times in life I regret not being a better person.\u201d Despite her insistence that we can\u2019t divide the world into neat dichotomies, Sanderson would be remiss not to document what makes it easier for certain people to speak out. She explains the concept of \u201cmoral rebels\u201d \u2013 people who show courage in speaking out and overcoming social pressure. These people tend to have higher self-esteem and also believe their actions will make a difference (though there are no official figures, Sanderson estimates between five and 10% of the population can be categorised this way). She is at pains, however, to make it clear that anyone can speak out. \u201cIt\u2019s not one-size-fits all,\u201d Sanderson says. She argues that not everyone has to be a knight in shining armour. \u201cYou can find a friend if you don\u2019t have the ability to do it alone\u201d or \u201cin some cases you might diffuse the situation by creating a joke\u201d. As well as social skills, learning more traditional skills also helps \u2013 early in the book, Sanderson notes that people trained in first aid are more likely to intervene in dangerous situations. \u201cThey weren\u2019t different in personality, but they were equipped with different skills.\u201d Yet it isn\u2019t just dangerous situations that concern Sanderson \u2013 much of her work is dedicated to how you can speak out about sexual harassment or workplace fraud. According to Sanderson, bystanders aren\u2019t just people who fail to run at terrorists with narwhal tusks, they\u2019re people who let sexist or racist jokes pass, too. She documents how silence perpetuates poor behaviour, citing a report that found men who have committed sexual assault believe other men accept their behaviour. Or as Martin Luther King Jr said: \u201cHistory will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamour of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people.\u201d \u201cMy hope is that reading this book will help people understand that they have a choice and they can act,\u201d Sanderson says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a courageous act, it doesn\u2019t have to be confronting the person shouting slurs on public transport, it can be going over and sitting with the victim and pretending that you know them to interrupt the situation.\u201d There is no doubt that Asma Shuweikh chose the courageous path. She recalls being bullied at 12 because she wore a hijab. One girl threw Shuweikh\u2019s lunch on the ground while others laughed \u2013 later that night, she went home and cried. \u201cMy mum and my brother said to me: \u2018Never, ever, ever be quiet when someone does something wrong to you.\u2019\u201d In the past, she has been targeted by Islamophobic abuse in public and felt hurt when no one spoke up on her behalf. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in that situation, you just don\u2019t think about yourself,\u201d she says of witnessing the antisemitic abuse on the tube. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the discrimination, don\u2019t like the injustice, you have to say something.\u201d The Bystander Effect by Catherine A Sanderson (Harper Collins, \u00a320) is published 16 April.
