Well, we tried three of the most popular to find out. Tinder The full festival experience may well include \u201cnocturnal activities\u201d, but it seems meeting up for a pre-arranged date isn\u2019t one of them. Although it is promising its festival mode for Lovebox and British Summer Time festivals in London, Tinder hasn\u2019t yet extended its service to the best-known festival of all. Nonetheless, it returns a bevvy of matches, who presumably regret it soon after, because my \u201cjournalistic inquiries\u201d are ignored. I was ghosted in Glastonbury. Maybe it is best to have fun the old-fashioned way. Ammar Kalia Bumble Bumble at Glastonbury is buzzing with the promise of romantic dates, potential friends and networking opportunities within a mile. Swiping through the smiling faces, a whole other festival experience opens up before me: a man who went to the same New Zealand university as me, many more defined by their interest in \u201cbanter\u201d and \u2013 over on Bumble Bizz \u2013 a life coach who specialises in childhood trauma (and also does hair for weddings). I am inundated with matches, but my mobile internet is too patchy to support any kind of back-and-forth, let alone arrange a spot at which to meet in the endless expanse of Worthy Farm. Plus, Bumble\u2019s defining feature \u2013 the woman makes the first move \u2013 means I am not prompted by messages from the men I have matched with to reply to them. \u201cCouldn\u2019t get laid at a festival\u201d may sound suspiciously like \u201ccouldn\u2019t organise a piss-up in a brewery\u201d \u2013 but trying to do it through an app manages to make it labour-intensive and fraught with difficulty. Better just to operate within a radius of five metres. Elle Hunt Grindr Aside from \u201cthe dark room\u201d at Glastonbury\u2019s gay nightclub, NYC Downlow, Grindr is probably the most efficient way to initiating a late-night festival rendezvous. What it lacks in spontaneity it makes up for in convenience: there is enough hiking across the site as it is \u2013 why not conserve energy by meeting someone eight tents away? Stefan, a 30-year-old visitor from the Netherlands, chatting via the app, says it is \u201can easy and fun way to meet like-minded boys, without drama or difficulties\u201d. He has been pleased to find festivalgoers keener to meet in person than those at home. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice change. At festivals, there seems to be no fakes around. No chit-chat, but actual meets.\u201d Sam, 23, says that Grindr can function as a dating site, a means to \u201cconnect like-minded folks to just hang out\u201d, and as \u201ca highway to the next casual hook-up\u201d \u2013 but, \u201cat Glasto, it\u2019s obviously much more the latter\u201d, he says. He has not met anyone yet, but intends to \u2013 he has been positively bombarded with messages. But using Grindr at Glastonbury isn\u2019t without its drawbacks \u2013 not least the speed with which it drains phone battery. \u201cIt\u2019s a smaller world here,\u201d says Sam. \u201cI had a couple of awkward moments bumping into someone at Block9 who mere hours ago I had blocked.\u201d Yikes.
